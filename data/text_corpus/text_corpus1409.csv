7045,operative distributed semi distributed rainfall runoff formulations need a mathematically tractable component for estimating the expected areal average infiltration rate i while point infiltration models are usually adopted for this purpose a model for i suitable for hydrological applications was proposed by morbidelli et al 2006 hydrological processes 20 1465 1481 the main model tenet is the use of cumulative infiltration as an independent variable and replacement of time by its expected value while this model as with many other models for field scale infiltration was tested through monte carlo methods it remains untested with experimental observations in this study a reassessment of the model s applicability is conducted through experimental evidence from several rainfall runoff events observed under natural conditions at the plot scale over a slight slope characterized by a silty loam soil during each experiment rainfall rate surface runoff at the plot outlet and soil water content vertical profiles were monitored at short time intervals an overall analysis of our results suggests that the model reliably simulates i and surface runoff as functions of time and is also suitable for applications under time dependent rainfall events the process of redistribution under rainfall hiatus is not addressed by this model keywords areal infiltration infiltration

coefficient of variation of a random variable 1 introduction simulation of many natural hydrological processes at field and watershed scales relies upon proper representation of areal average infiltration govindaraju et al 2001 areal average infiltration at the field scale has a crucial role in surface runoff prediction by distributed models that represent the hydrological response of a watershed through a superposition of field scale responses field scale infiltration also governs the evolution of soil water content corradini 2014 the transport of pollutants in the vadose zone fiori and de barros 2015 and the recharge of aquifers smerdon and drews 2017 areal averaging is a popular method to incorporate the natural spatial variability of hydraulic soil properties warrick and nielsen 1980 sharma et al 1987 loague and gander 1990 primarily that of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s russo and bresler 1981 1982 of the initial soil moisture content θ in and rainfall rate r corradini and singh 1985 at the field scale the effects of the spatial heterogeneity of θ in morbidelli et al 2012 and r morbidelli et al 2006 on the areal infiltration are significantly lower than those due to the variability of k s mainly because of the much larger coefficient of variation of k s the spatial variability of k s is generally represented by a random field characterized by a log normal probability density function pdf with a level of spatial correlation that can have an important effect on the variance of the field scale infiltration govindaraju et al 2001 consequently the mathematical problem concerning areal infiltration cannot be properly solved analytically and requires monte carlo simulations of k s along with a local rainfall infiltration model philip 1957 1969 mein and larson 1973 smith and parlange 1978 melone et al 2006 this procedure was adopted for instance by smith and hebbert 1979 maller and sharma 1984 milly and eagleson 1982 and saghafian et al 1995 thus an appropriate estimate of the ensemble averaged infiltration at the field scale is obtained but this method is too complex for large hydrological applications some alternative modeling approaches have therefore been proposed to obtain approximate solutions in the absence of the run on process that represents the infiltration of overland flow running downslope into pervious downstream areas along these lines significant and widely recognized contributions were presented by sivapalan and wood 1986 smith and goodrich 2000 and govindaraju et al 2001 sivapalan and wood 1986 developed approximate relations for areal average and variance of infiltration rate considering a random variability of k s and steady rainfall invariant in space monte carlo simulations were used to validate these relations but a single realization was used for the averaging procedure and the involved errors were not clearly expressed smith and goodrich 2000 developed a parametric formulation for areal average infiltration obtained through the latin hypercube sampling method and only one realization of k s for each combination of mean and coefficient of variation govindaraju et al 2001 presented a semi analytical conceptual model for the expected areal average infiltration obtained with k s as a random variable and uniform rainfall three different model versions were proposed the first one based on the assumption of cumulative infiltration as the independent variable associated with an expected infiltration time the second and third versions were obtained through a representation of point cumulative infiltration by a series expansion and a parameterized expression respectively some approaches for estimating the areal average infiltration in the case of a joint random horizontal variability of k s and r have been also proposed wood et al 1986 found expressions for areal mean and variance of infiltration rate but with the same limitations aforementioned for sivapalan and wood 1986 castelli 1996 proposed an analytical formulation for areal average infiltration but its application is limited by the simplified representation of infiltration at the local scale govindaraju et al 2006 developed a semi analytical model under the condition of a joint spatial heterogeneity of k s and r both assumed as random variables with pdf of lognormal type for k s and uniform type between two extreme values for r the mathematical formulation used cumulative infiltration as the independent variable along with a formulation for expected time the aforementioned modeling approaches assume negligible run on thus limiting their application this limitation is tested by the results from investigations performed using monte carlo simulations saghafian et al 1995 woolhiser et al 1996 corradini et al 1998 nahar et al 2004 however when including the run on process the estimate of the ensemble averaged infiltration by monte carlo technique becomes very complex considering that a coupled solution of a local infiltration model and an equation describing the surface runoff routing through the study area is required alternatively a simplified solution can be obtained by a mathematical model set up by morbidelli et al 2006 who combined the above mentioned semi analytical formulation of govindaraju et al 2006 with a semi empirical component for the run on process the model is fairly simple and requires the solution of a set of algebraic equations for given values of the first two moments of the probability density functions of both k s and r most of the models available for determining the areal average infiltration have been developed and or tested through monte carlo techniques but to our knowledge in depth studies of their accuracy in simulating observed hydrological processes have not been carried out the main objective of this paper is to test the model formulated by govindaraju et al 2006 and then extended by morbidelli et al 2006 using natural rainfall runoff events observed by an experimental system specifically designed at the plot scale starting from a natural soil an artificial plot with bounded sides uniform soil grain size distribution and significant horizontal spatial variability of k s has been used natural events consistent with the basic assumptions earlier adopted to develop the model namely absence of a surface sealing layer as well as of long periods of soil water redistribution have been selected the overall model accuracy and the effectiveness of the crucial model components are investigated in this paper 2 a short account of a semi analytical areal average infiltration modeling and its reassessment for application to real rainfall patterns building on the conceptualization of govindaraju et al 2006 morbidelli et al 2006 proposed an approach for representing direct rainfall infiltration with the run on process for the purpose of this study all the variables are considered to be independent for negligible effects of the spatial heterogeneity of θ in considering a total of n cells and a given realization of r and k s the areal average infiltration rate i at a given cumulative infiltration f can be written through a sum of the contributions of unsaturated and saturated cells as 1 i f 1 n i 1 n r i v 0 1 h f f pi i 1 n f i h f f pi where subscript i is adopted for variables in the i th spatial cell and p at the ponding time h is the heaviside step function f i is the local infiltration rate and v 0 is the discharge per unit surface representing run on as n eq 1 becomes an integral equation which involves the pdfs of k s and r and provides the expected areal average infiltration for a given value of f starting from this integral equation under the conditions of negligible run on and r invariant with time govindaraju et al 2006 using the extended green ampt model mein and larson 1973 and choosing f as the independent variable derived the following equation for ensemble averaged areal infiltration rate i n f from infinite realizations at the field scale 2 i n f 1 2 r f c 2 m k s r min r f c 2 m k s r min f c 2 r min 2 2 r m k s r min r f c 0 m k s r min f c 0 r m i n r 2 1 m k s r m i n r f c 0 1 f c r m i n r r m k s r m i n r f c 1 m k s r m i n f c 1 1 f c 1 r f c m k s r m i n r f c 2 m k s r m i n f c 2 1 f c m k s r m i n f c 1 where r min and r min r are the extreme values of a uniform pdf of r f c f ψ θ s θ in f with θ s soil water content at saturation and ψ soil suction head linked with the critical values of saturated hydraulic conductivity k c f c r which determine surface saturation for a given f and m k s is expressed by 3 m k s k a ω 0 k a k ω f k k d k where k a and ω represent the first and second argument respectively of the m k s function in eq 2 and f k k is the pdf of k s furthermore a relation between f and the corresponding expected time t f was proposed as 4 t f f r 1 m k s r f c 0 f ψ θ s θ in l n ψ θ s θ in ψ θ s θ in f m k s r f c 1 ψ δ θ j 1 1 j 1 r j 1 m k s r f c j where r and t f represent the expected field scale rainfall rate and the expected time associated to a given f value respectively estimated through the averaging procedure over the ensemble of realizations of k s and r because of the spatial variability of both k s and r the time t associated with a given f takes on different values in each cell therefore the expected time was assumed to approximate the actual relation i n t for the ensemble averaged areal infiltration rate as a function of time by that obtained from combining i n f and t f we also note that the series in the last term of eq 4 converges rapidly and can be approximated by the first five terms for most applications the inclusion of the run on process makes the problem analytically intractable therefore morbidelli et al 2006 proposed to represent its effects through an empirical term g additional to i n t 5 i t i n t g t c v k s c v r where i is the expected areal average infiltration rate c v k s and cv r denote the coefficients of variation of k s and r respectively and t is a time scaled to the time to ponding the explicit formulation of g is given in the appendix for spatially uniform rainfall and negligible run on in the absence of the empirical term in eq 5 and considering that 6 m k s r min r f c ω m k s r min f c ω 0 f o r ω 1 2 eq 2 can be rewritten as 7 i f r 1 m k s r f c 0 ψ θ s θ in f f m k s r f c 1 and eq 4 keeps the same form with r substituted by r for local rainfall rate variable with time and represented by a stepwise function it is first required to reformulate the extended green ampt model for steady rainfall considering the possible existence of a cumulative infiltration f 0 at the beginning of a rainfall event t 0 the cumulative infiltration in the ith cell during the unsaturated stage is expressed as 8 f i t f i 0 r i t t 0 t t pi f i f pi for spatially variable rainfall this leads to rewriting eq 4 as 9 t f t 0 f 0 r f r 1 m k s r f c 0 f ψ θ s θ in l n ψ θ s θ in ψ θ s θ in f m k s r f c 1 ψ θ s θ in j 1 1 j 1 r j 1 m k s r f c j while eqs 2 and 5 remain unchanged for spatially variable and unsteady rainfall we have generally available a stepwise function r t represented by successive pulses thus eqs 2 5 and 9 can be successively applied within each time step specifically at the end of the first time step with t f t 0 δ t f t 0 δ t is obtained as solution of eq 9 and then from eqs 2 and 5 i n f and i t 0 δ t respectively can be computed the values of f t 0 δ t and t 0 δ t are then used as new f 0 and t 0 for next time step with a new expected value of r the same procedure can be used for larger times finally we note that the model application is fairly simple because it requires the solution of ordinary algebraic equations eqs 2 5 and 9 for unsteady rainfall with very limited computational effort the first two moments of the pdfs of k s and r have to be assessed on the basis of direct measurements or values determined in similar areas or using pedotransfer functions 3 experimental system a closed plot with internal dimensions of 8 1 m 8 7 m was constructed with impermeable base and sides a 15 cm gravel drainage layer grain size of few centimeters was placed on the impermeable base a geotextile with a 3 mm depth was placed on the upper surface of the drainage layer to prevent the passage of fine particles a natural soil was first split up into several diameter classes and then carefully meshed to create a soil without roots and stones therefore the soil was characterized by a spatially uniform grain size distribution fig 1 even though differences in soil packing could not be completely eliminated this soil was placed on the geotextile to an evenly packed thickness of 70 cm the bare upper surface of the experimental plot had a slope of 4 the impermeable sides and base were designed to prevent overland flow or groundwater entry from outside the plot area the upper bare surface of the plot received natural rainfall and was exposed to natural wind and temperature fluctuations the measurements of rainfall and surface runoff used in this study were made in 2013 2014 this experimental plot using natural rainfall as the water source was later modified by the inclusion of an artificial rainfall system morbidelli et al 2017 in this study a tipping bucket system fig 2 was used to record the overland flow discharging from the plot while the infiltrated water flow discharging from the drainage layer was not examined later morbidelli et al 2017 used additional tipping buckets to analyze intermediate and deep flow in this study infiltration has been computed as difference between the experimental values of rainfall and overland flow according to the usda soil classification linsley et al 1992 this soil whose components are shown in table 1 was a silty loam its characteristics incorporated in the functional forms expressing the hydraulic properties smith et al 1993 are shown in table 1 with values taken out from morbidelli et al 2011 2014 and flammini et al 2018 as to k s the expected areal average value k s was determined in the absence of entrapped air by morbidelli et al 2017 who performed deep flow measurements for steady conditions under artificial rainfalls of long duration in the same work morbidelli et al 2017 determined the spatial variability of k s from measurements carried out using classical devices double ring infiltrometer csiro permeameter and guelph permeameter four vertical profiles of soil moisture were monitored in the locations shown in fig 2 through the time reflectometry technique tdr each profile was determined by four buriable three rod waveguides of length 20 cm inserted horizontally at 5 15 25 and 35 cm below the soil surface the measurements of soil water content obtained from the tdr signal through the universal calibration curve of topp et al 1980 were recorded at intervals of 30 min the whole system was used to investigate the movement of the wetting front and to estimate cumulative infiltration during a rainfall event measurements of rainfall rate and surface runoff at the soil surface outlet were performed with time resolution of 5 min by tipping bucket sensors fig 2 air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were also observed at time intervals of 5 min measurements of pan evaporation were also performed 4 selected rainfall runoff events and assessment of model input data the model solution in terms of i as a function of expected time t requires knowledge of 1 the first moments of the pdfs of k s and r and 2 the second moments henceforth expressed through the associated coefficients of variation c v k s and cv r in this investigation r has been assumed equal to the value observed by the available raingauge and cv r has been assessed as 0 05 on the basis of earlier unpublished measurements performed in a similar area this estimate is representative for frontal rainfalls over the experimental plot that is weakly influenced by local orography corradini 1985 in addition in the experiments of this work k s was expected to have a value less than that earlier obtained in the same plot by morbidelli et al 2017 because they worked under different conditions specifically they used steady conditions with saturation of the whole soil layer produced through artificial rainfalls of long duration and in the absence of entrapped air therefore because of the possible presence of entrapped air under natural rainfall events the model has to be applied using for k s the expected saturated hydraulic conductivity at natural saturation it has been deduced by adjustment through calibration events of the experimental value obtained by morbidelli et al 2017 this calibration procedure to a certain extent could also correct different structural deficiencies of the model however the physical meaning of k s should not be lost because as later shown the k s calibrated value was found to be in a typical range of fine textured soils in any case we note that the value of k s cannot be derived through an upscaling of a classical functional form f i eq 5 corradini et al 1997 for point hydraulic conductivity this is due to the fact that such a functional form involves spatially variable soil hydraulic properties through a nonlinear dependence the quantity c v k s was taken equal to 1 0 in agreement with measurements available in the literature for similar soil types smettem and clother 1989 mohanty et al 1994 this choice was also suggested by the experimental results obtained through classical devices by morbidelli et al 2017 from which similar levels of heterogeneity of k s at the plot scale were observed further quantities required by the model are θ in and ψ the initial soil water content was selected as the spatially averaged value obtained from the tdr measurements the suction head was deduced as a numerical solution of the net capillary drive melone et al 2006 referred to the range θ in θ s and expressed through the functional forms of the soil hydraulic properties sixteen natural rainfall runoff events were selected for k s calibration of and testing we have selected all the events occurred in the analysis period autumn winter for which there was a significant production of surface runoff at least 0 5 mm in depth furthermore we note that in this period heavy rainfalls were not observed table 2 summarizes these events that have been grouped so as to have two sets with comparable characteristics in terms of total rainfall and observed surface runoff as well as of the parameters θ in and ψ estimated in advance most events started from high values of θ in with respect to the saturated value θ s 0 36 all the events involved moderate rainfall rates occurred during the period autumn spring when the soil surface was not affected by cracks and formation of sealing layers the absence of a crust was deduced from the observed shapes of the vertical profiles v1 v4 of θ which were found to be typical of vertically homogeneous soils 5 experimental results as above discussed the model solution requires the assessment of k s under conditions associated to natural rainfall runoff events its value was determined by the following calibration procedure eight rainfall runoff events were selected to estimate k s the value of k s which gave the best agreement between model simulations and experimental results obtained for both surface runoff and areal average infiltration was adopted this optimal value was found to be 1 mmh 1 the quantities ε q and ε f represent the relative errors in the cumulative surface runoff q and cumulative infiltration f respectively and are defined as follows for any event 10 ε q q sim q ob q ob 11 ε f f sim f ob f ob where subscripts sim and ob stand for simulated and observed respectively as can be seen in table 3 on the average fairly limited relative errors in the cumulative surface runoff ε q 0 24 and very low relative errors in the cumulative infiltration ε f 0 06 were obtained from calibration events furthermore fig 3 shows that the temporal evolution of runoff and field scale infiltration depth obtained as difference of rainfall and runoff being evaporation negligible are well represented by the model particularly for the infiltration depth a lower accuracy in the simulation of surface runoff was found for the event of february 26 2014 with ε q 0 65 even if the shape of the hydrograph fig 4 a appears to be reasonable considering that at least the periods with and without runoff are well identified for the same event the model behavior was found to be satisfactory in terms of both cumulative infiltration depth ε f 0 08 and evolution of infiltration depth fig 4b a set of eight rainfall runoff events with characteristics similar in terms of range of total rainfall and surface runoff to those of the calibration events was selected to test the adopted model the comparison of the simulated results and data derived from these experiments carried out under natural conditions at the plot scale may be used to assess model reliability in the simulation of infiltration rate and surface runoff production in addition this comparison can enable us to evaluate the efficiency of the specific approximations utilized in developing the model framework the results obtained by this comparison for the cumulative depths of infiltration and surface runoff are summarized in table 3 with ε q 0 27 ε f 0 05 and as for the calibration events there is not a significant trend of the errors ε q and ε f therefore the model behavior for the calibration and validation events was found to be comparable in terms of cumulative depths of both runoff and infiltration for natural rainfall events four representative rainfall runoff events were selected to illustrate the validation of the model in fig 5 where a comparison of observed and modelled values of surface runoff and infiltration is shown the errors in the surface runoff are appreciable but the shape of the computed histograms is well simulated in addition observed histograms of the infiltration depth are reproduced with a great accuracy we note that the event of april 4 2014 was characterized by the lowest model accuracy for the surface runoff but the hydrograph shape was fairly well simulated and that in any case the infiltration depth as a function of time was well reproduced 6 discussion of results the adopted model relies upon the existence of spatial variability of k s through the study plot this variability can also be highlighted through an analysis of the observed vertical profiles of soil moisture content for the sample event of october 9 2013 earlier used in the calibration stage fig 6 illustrates the significant difference between the profile shapes observed in the representative verticals v1 and v2 of fig 2 this difference can be substantially ascribed to a spatial variation of k s as it can be deduced by the simulation of the local vertical profiles by an accurate point infiltration model specifically the model proposed by corradini et al 1997 validated using the richards equation and then laboratory experiments melone et al 2006 was applied fig 7 a displays an appropriate simulation of the vertical profile v1 carried out adopting the value k s 4 mmh 1 obtained by a calibration procedure and using the soil characteristics given in table 1 furthermore with the same value of k s the point model simulated adequately the vertical profile after a redistribution period of 12 h fig 7b the same approach used for the vertical profile v2 provided k s 0 4 mmh 1 in figs 6 and 7 θ in is represented by an interpolated constant value which fitted properly its observed value at t 0 this is required by the vertical profile shape adopted in the selected point infiltration model furthermore the existence of a large spatial heterogeneity of k s was supported by the very different cumulative infiltration values which were found equal to 7 4 0 3 3 7 and 5 4 mm in the verticals v1 v2 v3 and v4 of fig 2 respectively for the sake of simplicity frequently point infiltration models are used at larger spatial scales in the case the point infiltration model developed by corradini et al 1997 was applied with k s uniform through the plot and equal to 4 mmh 1 surface runoff would not be generated the same model used with k s spatially uniform and equal to 1 mmh 1 obtained by the calibration performed for k s would produce as surface runoff of 0 5 mm while the observed runoff was of 2 36 mm in the same context the point infiltration model applied with a k s specifically calibrated through the available events table 2 would provide substantial distortions of the surface runoff hydrographs this agrees with the results earlier obtained by corradini et al 2002 through monte carlo simulations after all it is widely recognized that the use of a single space invariant value of k s in substitution of a random field determines an early runoff generation in more permeable soil points and a delayed runoff production in less permeable soil points with the result of a direct hydrograph narrower than the actual one corradini et al 2002 the above results indicate that the stochastic problem of areal infiltration linked with the spatial heterogeneity of k s cannot be replaced by a deterministic approximation based on the use of a single value of k s considered uniform through the study field on the other hand the investigated areal model as a whole represents the main features of the surface runoff hydrograph satisfactorily and simulates the observed infiltration patterns with a high accuracy in addition on the basis of the characteristics of the available experiments it is also possible to deduce the satisfactory reliability of the model components because 1 the hyetographs shown in figs 3 and 5 highlight that the model has been calibrated and checked with appropriate results using time dependent natural rainfall events therefore the stepwise approach adopted to extend the basic model developed for steady rainfall to the formulation for variable rainfall rate appears to be a viable approach 2 the trend of the observed areal infiltration as a function of time does not experience significant distortions figs 3b and 5b this indicates that the crucial assumption of f as independent variable combined with a formulation of the expected time provides a suitable mathematical approximation of the physical process 3 through monte carlo simulations morbidelli et al 2006 showed that run on has a significant effect for moderate storms and high values of c v k s and or cv r provided θ in θ s furthermore they found the run on effect to be negligible for θ in θ s therefore for most events of table 2 characterized by values of θ in in the range 0 30 0 33 very close to θ s 0 36 the role of run on was substantially limited on the other hand in each group calibration and validation one event was expected to be influenced by this process in this context for example a comparison of the events of october 5 2013 θ in 0 238 and march 4 2014 θ in 0 328 reveals an appreciable model performance fig 5 this suggests that the two model components the semi analytical and the empirical ones interact fairly well to represent field scale behavior 7 conclusions the natural spatial variability of hydraulic soil properties particularly that of the saturated hydraulic conductivity makes the implementation of distributed semi distributed rainfall runoff models with point infiltration approaches largely inapplicable in this regard areal infiltration models that reduce the stochastic problem to a tractable deterministic problem incurring modest computational effort are desirable this study highlights the performance of such a model for an artificial field plot characterized by a vertically homogeneous soil under numerous time varying rainfall events the results reveal the model reassessed for application to unsteady rainfall patterns to show promise in terms of simulation of areal infiltration and surface runoff the comparable performance associated with events with negligible and significant run on effect suggests that semi analytical and empirical model components contribute to field scale infiltration appropriately furthermore good agreement between observed and simulated infiltration and surface runoff depths as functions of time highlights the applicability of the framework of the model which relies upon the adoption of cumulative infiltration as an independent variable linked with the expected time in addition results indicate the model is also suitable for applications under conditions of time dependent rainfall events the solution of the mathematical model is simple and requires the knowledge of the first two moments of pdfs of both k s and r the tested model enables us to link the representation of infiltration and hortonian surface runoff at different spatial scales in this context we remark that these processes are quantified at field scale starting from a classical point infiltration approach then distributed semi distributed formulations of the hydrological response to rainfall at the watershed scale can be developed through an ensemble of field scale elements each one with spatially uniform soil typology of course this scheme has to be consistent with the representation of homogeneous precipitation areas finally the model was formulated for vertically homogeneous soils and events not involving redistribution of soil water content within a single rainfall runoff event the last process can significantly affect the model results mainly for long redistribution periods furthermore in the representation of the expected areal average infiltration for cases with formation of a thin crust or a more permeable upper layer due to tilled soils or and presence of vegetation the adoption of a two layered soil with uniform k s in each layer with k s k s in the top layer can be considered a satisfactory first approximation for i t acknowledgment this research was mainly financed by the ministry of education university and research italy prin 2015 appendix morbidelli et al 2006 deduced the empirical term in the right hand side of eq 5 through a variety of monte carlo simulations in explicit form this term was expressed by a gamma function askey

7045,operative distributed semi distributed rainfall runoff formulations need a mathematically tractable component for estimating the expected areal average infiltration rate i while point infiltration models are usually adopted for this purpose a model for i suitable for hydrological applications was proposed by morbidelli et al 2006 hydrological processes 20 1465 1481 the main model tenet is the use of cumulative infiltration as an independent variable and replacement of time by its expected value while this model as with many other models for field scale infiltration was tested through monte carlo methods it remains untested with experimental observations in this study a reassessment of the model s applicability is conducted through experimental evidence from several rainfall runoff events observed under natural conditions at the plot scale over a slight slope characterized by a silty loam soil during each experiment rainfall rate surface runoff at the plot outlet and soil water content vertical profiles were monitored at short time intervals an overall analysis of our results suggests that the model reliably simulates i and surface runoff as functions of time

rate r corradini and singh 1985 at the field scale the effects of the spatial heterogeneity of θ in morbidelli et al 2012 and r morbidelli et al 2006 on the areal infiltration are significantly lower than those due to the variability of k s mainly because of the much larger coefficient of variation of k s the spatial variability of k s is generally represented by a random field characterized by a log normal probability density function pdf with a level of spatial correlation that can have an important effect on the variance of the field scale infiltration govindaraju et al 2001 consequently the mathematical problem concerning areal infiltration cannot be properly solved analytically and requires monte carlo simulations of k s along with a local rainfall infiltration model philip 1957 1969 mein and larson 1973 smith and parlange 1978 melone et al 2006 this procedure was adopted for instance by smith and hebbert 1979 maller and sharma 1984 milly and eagleson 1982 and saghafian et al 1995 thus an appropriate estimate of the ensemble averaged infiltration at the field scale is obtained but this method is too complex for large hydrological applications some alternative modeling approaches have therefore been proposed to obtain approximate solutions in the absence of the run on process that represents the infiltration of overland flow running downslope into pervious downstream areas along these lines significant and widely recognized contributions were presented by sivapalan and wood 1986 smith and goodrich 2000 and govindaraju et al 2001 sivapalan and wood 1986 developed approximate relations for areal average and variance of infiltration rate considering a random variability of k s and steady rainfall invariant in space monte carlo simulations were used to validate these relations but a single realization was used for the averaging procedure and the involved errors were not clearly expressed smith and goodrich 2000 developed a parametric formulation for areal average infiltration obtained through the latin hypercube sampling method and only one realization of k s for each combination of mean and coefficient of variation govindaraju et al 2001 presented a semi analytical conceptual model for the expected areal average infiltration obtained with k s as a random variable and uniform rainfall three different model versions were proposed the first one based on the assumption of cumulative infiltration as the independent variable associated with an expected infiltration time the second and third versions were obtained through a representation of point cumulative infiltration by a series expansion and a parameterized expression respectively some approaches for estimating the areal average infiltration in the case of a joint random horizontal variability of k s and r have been also proposed wood et al 1986 found expressions for areal mean and variance of infiltration rate but with the same limitations aforementioned for sivapalan and wood 1986 castelli 1996 proposed an analytical formulation for areal average infiltration but its application is limited by the simplified representation of infiltration at the local scale govindaraju et al 2006 developed a semi analytical model under the condition of a joint spatial heterogeneity of k s and r both assumed as random variables with pdf of lognormal type for k s and uniform type between two extreme values for r the mathematical formulation used cumulative infiltration as the independent variable along with a formulation for expected time the aforementioned modeling approaches assume negligible run on thus limiting their application this limitation is tested by the results from investigations performed using monte carlo simulations saghafian et al 1995 woolhiser et al 1996 corradini et al 1998 nahar et al 2004 however when including the run on process the estimate of the ensemble averaged infiltration by monte carlo technique becomes very complex considering that a coupled solution of a local infiltration model and an equation describing the surface runoff routing through the study area is required alternatively a simplified solution can be obtained by a mathematical model set up by morbidelli et al 2006 who combined the above mentioned semi analytical formulation of govindaraju et al 2006 with a semi empirical component for the run on process the model is fairly simple and requires the solution of a set of algebraic equations for given values of the first two moments of the probability density functions of both k s and r most of the models available for determining the areal average infiltration have been developed and or tested through monte carlo techniques but to our knowledge in depth studies of their accuracy in simulating observed hydrological processes have not been carried out the main objective of this paper is to test the model formulated by govindaraju et al 2006 and then extended by morbidelli et al 2006 using natural rainfall runoff events observed by an experimental system specifically designed at the plot scale starting from a natural soil an artificial plot with bounded sides uniform soil grain size distribution and significant horizontal spatial variability of k s has been used natural events consistent with the basic assumptions earlier adopted to develop the model namely absence of a surface sealing layer as well as of long periods of soil water redistribution have been selected the overall model accuracy and the effectiveness of the crucial model components are investigated in this paper 2 a short account of a semi analytical areal average infiltration modeling and its reassessment for application to real rainfall patterns building on the conceptualization of govindaraju et al 2006 morbidelli et al 2006 proposed an approach for representing direct rainfall infiltration with the run on process for the purpose of this study all the variables are considered to be independent for negligible effects of the spatial heterogeneity of θ in considering a total of n cells and a given realization of r and k s the areal average infiltration rate i at a given cumulative infiltration f can be written through a sum of the contributions of unsaturated and saturated cells as 1 i f 1 n i 1 n r i v 0 1 h f f pi i 1 n f i h f f pi where subscript i is adopted for variables in the i th spatial cell and p at the ponding time h is the heaviside step function f i is the local infiltration rate and v 0 is the discharge per unit surface representing run on as n eq 1 becomes an integral equation which involves the pdfs of k s and r and provides the expected areal average infiltration for a given value of f starting from this integral equation under the conditions of negligible run on and r invariant with time govindaraju et al 2006 using the extended green ampt model mein and larson 1973 and choosing f as the independent variable derived the following equation for ensemble averaged areal infiltration rate i n f from infinite realizations at the field scale 2 i n f 1 2 r f c 2 m k s r min r f c 2 m k s r min f c 2 r min 2 2 r m k s r min r f c 0 m k s r min f c 0 r m i n r 2 1 m k s r m i n r f c 0 1 f c r m i n r r m k s r m i n r f c 1 m k s r m i n f c 1 1 f c 1 r f c m k s r m i n r f c 2 m k s r m i n f c 2 1 f c m k s r m i n f c 1 where r min and r min r are the extreme values of a uniform pdf of r f c f ψ θ s θ in f with θ s soil water content at saturation and ψ soil suction head linked with the critical values of saturated hydraulic conductivity k c f c r which determine surface saturation for a given f and m k s is expressed by 3 m k s k a ω 0 k a k ω f k k d k where k a and ω represent the first and second argument respectively of the m k s function in eq 2 and f k k is the pdf of k s furthermore a relation between f and the corresponding expected time t f was proposed as 4 t f f r 1 m k s r f c 0 f ψ θ s θ in l n ψ θ s θ in ψ θ s θ in f m k s r f c 1 ψ δ θ j 1 1 j 1 r j 1 m k s r f c j where r and t f represent the expected field scale rainfall rate and the expected time associated to a given f value respectively estimated through the averaging procedure over the ensemble of realizations of k s and r because of the spatial variability of both k s and r the time t associated with a given f takes on different values in each cell therefore the expected time was assumed to approximate the actual relation i n t for the ensemble averaged areal infiltration rate as a function of time by that obtained from combining i n f and t f we also note that the series in the last term of eq 4 converges rapidly and can be approximated by the first five terms for most applications the inclusion of the run on process makes the problem analytically intractable therefore morbidelli et al 2006 proposed to represent its effects through an empirical term g additional to i n t 5 i t i n t g t c v k s c v r where i is the expected areal average infiltration rate c v k s and cv r denote the coefficients of variation of k s and r respectively and t is a time scaled to the time to ponding the explicit formulation of g is given in the appendix for spatially uniform rainfall and negligible run on in the absence of the empirical term in eq 5 and considering that 6 m k s r min r f c ω m k s r min f c ω 0 f o r ω 1 2 eq 2 can be rewritten as 7 i f r 1 m k s r f c 0 ψ θ s θ in f f m k s r f c 1 and eq 4 keeps the same form with r substituted by r for local rainfall rate variable with time and represented by a stepwise function it is first required to reformulate the extended green ampt model for steady rainfall considering the possible existence of a cumulative infiltration f 0 at the beginning of a rainfall event t 0 the cumulative infiltration in the ith cell during the unsaturated stage is expressed as 8 f i t f i 0 r i t t 0 t t pi f i f pi for spatially variable rainfall this leads to rewriting eq 4 as 9 t f t 0 f 0 r f r 1 m k s r f c 0 f ψ θ s θ in l n ψ θ s θ in ψ θ s θ in f m k s r f c 1 ψ θ s θ in j 1 1 j 1 r j 1 m k s r f c j while eqs 2 and 5 remain unchanged for spatially variable and unsteady rainfall we have generally available a stepwise function r t represented by successive pulses thus eqs 2 5 and 9 can be successively applied within each time step specifically at the end of the first time step with t f t 0 δ t f t 0 δ t is obtained as solution of eq 9 and then from eqs 2 and 5 i n f and i t 0 δ t respectively can be computed the values of f t 0 δ t and t 0 δ t are then used as new f 0 and t 0 for next time step with a new expected value of r the same procedure can be used for larger times finally we note that the model application is fairly simple because it requires the solution of ordinary algebraic equations eqs 2 5 and 9 for unsteady rainfall with very limited computational effort the first two moments of the pdfs of k s and r have to be assessed on the basis of direct measurements or values determined in similar areas or using pedotransfer functions 3 experimental system a closed plot with internal dimensions of 8 1 m 8 7 m was constructed with impermeable base and sides a 15 cm gravel drainage layer grain size of few centimeters was placed on the impermeable base a geotextile with a 3 mm depth was placed on the upper surface of the drainage layer to prevent the passage of fine particles a natural soil was first split up into several diameter classes and then carefully meshed to create a soil without roots and stones therefore the soil was characterized by a spatially uniform grain size distribution fig 1 even though differences in soil packing could not be completely eliminated this soil was placed on the geotextile to an evenly packed thickness of 70 cm the bare upper surface of the experimental plot had a slope of 4 the impermeable sides and base were designed to prevent overland flow or groundwater entry from outside the plot area the upper bare surface of the plot received natural rainfall and was exposed to natural wind and temperature fluctuations the measurements of rainfall and surface runoff used in this study were made in 2013 2014 this experimental plot using natural rainfall as the water source was later modified by the inclusion of an artificial rainfall system morbidelli et al 2017 in this study a tipping bucket system fig 2 was used to record the overland flow discharging from the plot while the infiltrated water flow discharging from the drainage layer was not examined later morbidelli et al 2017 used additional tipping buckets to analyze intermediate and deep flow in this study infiltration has been computed as difference between the experimental values of rainfall and overland flow according to the usda soil classification linsley et al 1992 this soil whose components are shown in table 1 was a silty loam its characteristics incorporated in the functional forms expressing the hydraulic properties smith et al 1993 are shown in table 1 with values taken out from morbidelli et al 2011 2014 and flammini et al 2018 as to k s the expected areal average value k s was determined in the absence of entrapped air by morbidelli et al 2017 who performed deep flow measurements for steady conditions under artificial rainfalls of long duration in the same work morbidelli et al 2017 determined the spatial variability of k s from measurements carried out using classical devices double ring infiltrometer csiro permeameter and guelph permeameter four vertical profiles of soil moisture were monitored in the locations shown in fig 2 through the time reflectometry technique tdr each profile was determined by four buriable three rod waveguides of length 20 cm inserted horizontally at 5 15 25 and 35 cm below the soil surface the measurements of soil water content obtained from the tdr signal through the universal calibration curve of topp et al 1980 were recorded at intervals of 30 min the whole system was used to investigate the movement of the wetting front and to estimate cumulative infiltration during a rainfall event measurements of rainfall rate and surface runoff at the soil surface outlet were performed with time resolution of 5 min by tipping bucket sensors fig 2 air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were also observed at time intervals of 5 min measurements of pan evaporation were also performed 4 selected rainfall runoff events and assessment of model input data the model solution in terms of i as a function of expected time t requires knowledge of 1 the first moments of the pdfs of k s and r and 2 the second moments henceforth expressed through the associated coefficients of variation c v k s and cv r in this investigation r has been assumed equal to the value observed by the available raingauge and cv r has been assessed as 0 05 on the basis of earlier unpublished measurements performed in a similar area this estimate is representative for frontal rainfalls over the experimental plot that is weakly influenced by local orography corradini 1985 in addition in the experiments of this work k s was expected to have a value less than that earlier obtained in the same plot by morbidelli et al 2017 because they worked under different conditions specifically they used steady conditions with saturation of the whole soil layer produced through artificial rainfalls of long duration and in the absence of entrapped air therefore because of the possible presence of entrapped air under natural rainfall events the model has to be applied using for k s the expected saturated hydraulic conductivity at natural saturation it has been deduced by adjustment through calibration events of the experimental value obtained by morbidelli et al 2017 this calibration procedure to a certain extent could also correct different structural deficiencies of the model however the physical meaning of k s should not be lost because as later shown the k s calibrated value was found to be in a typical range of fine textured soils in any case we note that the value of k s cannot be derived through an upscaling of a classical functional form f i eq 5 corradini et al 1997 for point hydraulic conductivity this is due to the fact that such a functional form involves spatially variable soil hydraulic properties through a nonlinear dependence the quantity c v k s was taken equal to 1 0 in agreement with measurements available in the literature for similar soil types smettem and clother 1989 mohanty et al 1994 this choice was also suggested by the experimental results obtained through classical devices by morbidelli et al 2017 from which similar levels of heterogeneity of k s at the plot scale were observed further quantities required by the model are θ in and ψ the initial soil water content was selected as the spatially averaged value obtained from the tdr measurements the suction head was deduced as a numerical solution of the net capillary drive melone et al 2006 referred to the range θ in θ s and expressed through the functional forms of the soil hydraulic properties sixteen natural rainfall runoff events were selected for k s calibration of and testing we have selected all the events occurred in the analysis period autumn winter for which there was a significant production of surface runoff at least 0 5 mm in depth furthermore we note that in this period heavy rainfalls were not observed table 2 summarizes these events that have been grouped so as to have two sets with comparable characteristics in terms of total rainfall and observed surface runoff as well as of the parameters θ in and ψ estimated in advance most events started from high values of θ in with respect to the saturated value θ s 0 36 all the events involved moderate rainfall rates occurred during the period autumn spring when the soil surface was not affected by cracks and formation of sealing layers the absence of a crust was deduced from the observed shapes of the vertical profiles v1 v4 of θ which were found to be typical of vertically homogeneous soils 5 experimental results as above discussed the model solution requires the assessment of k s under conditions associated to natural rainfall runoff events its value was determined by the following calibration procedure eight rainfall runoff events were selected to estimate k s the value of k s which gave the best agreement between model simulations and experimental results obtained for both surface runoff and areal average infiltration was adopted this optimal value was found to be 1 mmh 1 the quantities ε q and ε f represent the relative errors in the cumulative surface runoff q and cumulative infiltration f respectively and are defined as follows for any event 10 ε q q sim q ob q ob 11 ε f f sim f ob f ob where subscripts sim and ob stand for simulated and observed respectively as can be seen in table 3 on the average fairly limited relative errors in the cumulative surface runoff ε q 0 24 and very low relative errors in the cumulative infiltration ε f 0 06 were obtained from calibration events furthermore fig 3 shows that the temporal evolution of runoff and field scale infiltration depth obtained as difference of rainfall and runoff being evaporation negligible are well represented by the model particularly for the infiltration depth a lower accuracy in the simulation of surface runoff was found for the event of february 26 2014 with ε q 0 65 even if the shape of the hydrograph fig 4 a appears to be reasonable considering that at least the periods with and without runoff are well identified for the same event the model behavior was found to be satisfactory in terms of both cumulative infiltration depth ε f 0 08 and evolution of infiltration depth fig 4b a set of eight rainfall runoff events with characteristics similar in terms of range of total rainfall and surface runoff to those of the calibration events was selected to test the adopted model the comparison of the simulated results and data derived from these experiments carried out under natural conditions at the plot scale may be used to assess model reliability in the simulation of infiltration rate and surface runoff production in addition this comparison can enable us to evaluate the efficiency of the specific approximations utilized in developing the model framework the results obtained by this comparison for the cumulative depths of infiltration and surface runoff are summarized in table 3 with ε q 0 27 ε f 0 05 and as for the calibration events there is not a significant trend of the errors ε q and ε f therefore the model behavior for the calibration and validation events was found to be comparable in terms of cumulative depths of both runoff and infiltration for natural rainfall events four representative rainfall runoff events were selected to illustrate the validation of the model in fig 5 where a comparison of observed and modelled values of surface runoff and infiltration is shown the errors in the surface runoff are appreciable but the shape of the computed histograms is well simulated in addition observed histograms of the infiltration depth are reproduced with a great accuracy we note that the event of april 4 2014 was characterized by the lowest model accuracy for the surface runoff but the hydrograph shape was fairly well simulated and that in any case the infiltration depth as a function of time was well reproduced 6 discussion of results the adopted model relies upon the existence of spatial variability of k s through the study plot this variability can also be highlighted through an analysis of the observed vertical profiles of soil moisture content for the sample event of october 9 2013 earlier used in the calibration stage fig 6 illustrates the significant difference between the profile shapes observed in the representative verticals v1 and v2 of fig 2 this difference can be substantially ascribed to a spatial variation of k s as it can be deduced by the simulation of the local vertical profiles by an accurate point infiltration model specifically the model proposed by corradini et al 1997 validated using the richards equation and then laboratory experiments melone et al 2006 was applied fig 7 a displays an appropriate simulation of the vertical profile v1 carried out adopting the value k s 4 mmh 1 obtained by a calibration procedure and using the soil characteristics given in table 1 furthermore with the same value of k s the point model simulated adequately the vertical profile after a redistribution period of 12 h fig 7b the same approach used for the vertical profile v2 provided k s 0 4 mmh 1 in figs 6 and 7 θ in is represented by an interpolated constant value which fitted properly its observed value at t 0 this is required by the vertical profile shape adopted in the selected point infiltration model furthermore the existence of a large spatial heterogeneity of k s was supported by the very different cumulative infiltration values which were found equal to 7 4 0 3 3 7 and 5 4 mm in the verticals v1 v2 v3 and v4 of fig 2 respectively for the sake of simplicity frequently point infiltration models are used at larger spatial scales in the case the point infiltration model developed by corradini et al 1997 was applied with k s uniform through the plot and equal to 4 mmh 1 surface runoff would not be generated the same model used with k s spatially uniform and equal to 1 mmh 1 obtained by the calibration performed for k s would produce as surface runoff of 0 5 mm while the observed runoff was of 2 36 mm in the same context the point infiltration model applied with a k s specifically calibrated through the available events table 2 would provide substantial distortions of the surface runoff hydrographs this agrees with the results earlier obtained by corradini et al 2002 through monte carlo simulations after all it is widely recognized that the use of a single space invariant value of k s in substitution of a random field determines an early runoff generation in more permeable soil points and a delayed runoff production in less permeable soil points with the result of a direct hydrograph narrower than the actual one corradini et al 2002 the above results indicate that the stochastic problem of areal infiltration linked with the spatial heterogeneity of k s cannot be replaced by a deterministic approximation based on the use of a single value of k s considered uniform through the study field on the other hand the investigated areal model as a whole represents the main features of the surface runoff hydrograph satisfactorily and simulates the observed infiltration patterns with a high accuracy in addition on the basis of the characteristics of the available experiments it is also possible to deduce the satisfactory reliability of the model components because 1 the hyetographs shown in figs 3 and 5 highlight that the model has been calibrated and checked with appropriate results using time dependent natural rainfall events therefore the stepwise approach adopted to extend the basic model developed for steady rainfall to the formulation for variable rainfall rate appears to be a viable approach 2 the trend of the observed areal infiltration as a function of time does not experience significant distortions figs 3b and 5b this indicates that the crucial assumption of f as independent variable combined with a formulation of the expected time provides a suitable mathematical approximation of the physical process 3 through monte carlo simulations morbidelli et al 2006 showed that run on has a significant effect for moderate storms and high values of c v k s and or cv r provided θ in θ s furthermore they found the run on effect to be negligible for θ in θ s therefore for most events of table 2 characterized by values of θ in in the range 0 30 0 33 very close to θ s 0 36 the role of run on was substantially limited on the other hand in each group calibration and validation one event was expected to be influenced by this process in this context for example a comparison of the events of october 5 2013 θ in 0 238 and march 4 2014 θ in 0 328 reveals an appreciable model performance fig 5 this suggests that the two model components the semi analytical and the empirical ones interact fairly well to represent field scale behavior 7 conclusions the natural spatial variability of hydraulic soil properties particularly that of the saturated hydraulic conductivity makes the implementation of distributed semi distributed rainfall runoff models with point infiltration approaches largely inapplicable in this regard areal infiltration models that reduce the stochastic problem to a tractable deterministic problem incurring modest computational effort are desirable this study highlights the performance of such a model for an artificial field plot characterized by a vertically homogeneous soil under numerous time varying rainfall events the results reveal the model reassessed for application to unsteady rainfall patterns to show promise in terms of simulation of areal infiltration and surface runoff the comparable performance associated with events with negligible and significant run on effect suggests that semi analytical and empirical model components contribute to field scale infiltration appropriately furthermore good agreement between observed and simulated infiltration and surface runoff depths as functions of time highlights the applicability of the framework of the model which relies upon the adoption of cumulative infiltration as an independent variable linked with the expected time in addition results indicate the model is also suitable for applications under conditions of time dependent rainfall events the solution of the mathematical model is simple and requires the knowledge of the first two moments of pdfs of both k s and r the tested model enables us to link the representation of infiltration and hortonian surface runoff at different spatial scales in this context we remark that these processes are quantified at field scale starting from a classical point infiltration approach then distributed semi distributed formulations of the hydrological response to rainfall at the watershed scale can be developed through an ensemble of field scale elements each one with spatially uniform soil typology of course this scheme has to be consistent with the representation of homogeneous precipitation areas finally the model was formulated for vertically homogeneous soils and events not involving redistribution of soil water content within a single rainfall runoff event the last process can significantly affect the model results mainly for long redistribution periods furthermore in the representation of the expected areal average infiltration for cases with formation of a thin crust or a more permeable upper layer due to tilled soils or and presence of vegetation the adoption of a two layered soil with uniform k s in each layer with k s k s in the top layer can be considered a satisfactory first approximation for i t acknowledgment this research was mainly financed by the ministry of education university and research italy prin 2015

7046,during the complex dynamic interactions between rainfall and basin properties different portions of the basin produce runoff at different moments capturing this spatiotemporal variability is important for flood analysis but knowledge of this subject is limited the presented research aims at improving the understanding of runoff contributing areas rca hillslope sections from which water flows reaches the stream network and consequently the basin outlet and at examining their relationship with the magnitude of a flash flood s peak discharge a distributed hydrological model gb hydra that enables computing rca and flood discharge was developed the model was applied to four medium size basins 18 69 km2 in a mediterranean climate and 59 flash flood events were analyzed the correlation between basin input flux basin area multiplied by the basin maximal rain intensity averaged over the time of concentration and output flux observed peak discharge was poor r2 0 16 however using a newly developed index termed irca to calculate the input flux accounting only for the rca extent and rainfall intensity over it resulted in a substantially higher correlation r2 0 64 across a wide range of flood magnitudes the highest correlation was found using a 50 min time window which is shorter than the time of concentration flood events were categorized according to their magnitude and the differences of several factors among the groups were examined pre storm soil moisture content was found to be similar for all event magnitudes however pre peak soil moisture content was substantially different between moderate and large extreme events other important properties that differed between magnitudes were rca extent and its averaged rain intensity and ratio of convective rainfall finally areas with land uses characterized by low runoff potential became dominant and contributed mainly during large and extreme events although the rca and its extent full potential is yet to be fulfilled it is proposed as a significant tool for understanding processes of flash flood generation at the basin scale in future research keywords grid based hydrological model flash flood peak

flow that reaches a climax represented by the peak discharge chow et al 1988 sene 2013 however not all basin areas are activated to the same extent or in the same moment moreover the runoff generated at a given location may reinfiltrate downstream instead of reaching the basin outlet chow et al 1988 consequently water contributing to the outlet peak discharge often comes only from a partial area

multiplying a runoff coefficient the basin size and the maximal basin averaged rain intensity for a typical time commonly taken as the time of concentration brutsaert 2005 chow et al 1988 gericke and smithers 2014 viessman and lewis 2002 this characteristic time is also a crucial factor in evaluating rca extent as it can be estimated over various time scales such as seasonal latron and gallart

resulting peak discharge are still not fully understood especially in small to medium size 100 km2 basins bracken and croke 2007 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 merheb et al 2016 the current study aims to extend the knowledge of these complex interactions focusing on rca rain intensity and peak discharge the following research questions are addressed i what is the rca dynamics during flash flood events ii what is the correlation between peak discharge and the multiplication of rca extent and rain intensity over it and for which time scale is it optimized iii are flash floods of different magnitudes characterized by distinguishable rain and rca properties to address these questions we developed and utilized a fully distributed grid based hydrological model gb hydra and analyzed 59 flash flood events in four medium size rural mediterranean basins the paper is arranged as follows general details about the research area data and studied events are given in section 2 section 3 describes the gb hydra model and its utilization in section 4 the concept of rca and the correlation between peak discharge and a new index irca are presented section 5 deals with the effect of rain and rca properties

region northern israel were used for this research ada upper taninim upper dalya and lower dalya fig 1 the area is characterized by a hilly terrain with moderate to steep hillslopes 3 45 with steeper sections in the upper parts of ada and upper taninim basins and in the lower parts of upper and lower dalya basins the lithology of the region is dominated by the chalks of the lower eocene adulam formation where at the southeastern part of the research area the chalks and marls of the paleocene taqiye formation are exposed grodek et al 2012 peleg et al 2015 sneh et al 1998 the area is covered by rendzina soils singer 2007 but in several distinct locations on the ridges the soil is absent revealing patches of bedrock dan et al 1975 grodek et al 2012 the entire area is subject to severe soil erosion due to intensive cultivation as a result the average soil depth on the hillslopes is 30 10 cm with some of the hillslopes having a thinner soil cover 10 cm a detailed land use map fig 1 was produced at a resolution of 10 m using recent aerial photographs and field surveys land use observed to be rather stable during the research years 1990 2013 includes uncultivated 37 and cultivated 16 fields groves and forests 20 plantations 15 and a rural residential area small sparsely distributed family houses with open grass yards and cultivated areas between them 10 channel depths and widths were measured in 43 locations in all four basins and extrapolated to gain a comprehensive assessment of the stream network and cross sectional properties rainfall in the area generally occurs between october and may the mean annual rainfall is 660 mm where 60 70 of it occurs during the winter from december to february and the mean number of rainy days is 60 israel meteorological service the mean annual potential evaporation is 1900 mm and during the winter months the average is 70 mm per month goldreich 2003 rainstorms are mainly 94 of mediterranean origin peleg and morin 2012 and usually last from several hours to a few days goldreich 2003 the entire area is prone to flash floods of different magnitudes on average 7 events in a year the maximal recorded specific peak discharge is of 3 3 m3 s 1 km 2 and extreme events in the region occasionally result in casualties and damage grodek et al 2012 inbar 2018 morin et al 2007 the common hydrograph shape is characterized by a fast rising limb tens of minutes to several hours and a slower recession time that can last over a day fig 2 a 2 2 hydrometeorological data the area is covered by a c band non doppler weather radar situated 60 70

estimates were obtained by applying a set of physically based corrections to the measured reflectivity antenna pointing ground echoes wet radome attenuation beam blockage attenuation and vertical profile reflectivity a fixed z r relationship z 316r1 5 was used to derive rain intensity and an upper threshold of 150 mm h 1 was set to reduce the possible impact of hail marra and morin 2015 followed by an annual range dependent gauge adjustment morin and gabella 2007 for the present study an additional mean field bias adjustment was applied for each storm using data from 14 to 20 daily rain gauges situated near the research area israel meteorological service data from these daily rain gauges were also used to evaluate the initial soil moisture conditions for each rainstorm monthly climatological potential evaporation rates goldreich 2003 and 10 min temperature data from three weather stations in the region were used to assess potential daily evaporation rates measured streamflow discharge data israel hydrological service are available from four hydrometric stations located at basin outlets fig 1 and operating from 1956 to 1968 to the present an additional seven peak discharge estimations are available at ungauged locations with drainage areas of 4 5 40 km2 fig 1 from two post event surveys table 2 arazi et al 2002 garti et al 1995 2 3 event selection and categorization a quality check was applied to all available radar and discharge data events with non continuous radar images or a local gauge adjustment correction factor 0 4 or 1 6 were excluded as well as cases in which the discharge data were reported to be of low quality based on the recurrence interval of the observed peak discharges see thresholds in table 1 and fig 2b the events were classified as low 2 years moderate 2 10 years large 10 50 years and extreme 50 years recurrence intervals were estimated by fitting a generalized extreme value gev distribution haan and charles 2002 to the annual maximum measured peak discharges records for 50 68 years depending on the basin fig 2b 3 extreme events 12 large ones and 44 moderate ones were found to match the above criteria and were selected for further analysis table 3 while low events were excluded from this research 3 grid based hydrological distributed runoff gb hydra model the use of a distributed hydrological model is essential when runoff response is driven by the high spatial heterogeneity of rainfall and or of basin properties downer et al 2002 fatichi et al 2016 grayson and bloschl 2000 merheb et al 2016 moretti and montanari 2007 different distributed models have been developed in recent years e g downer et al 2002 downer and ogden 2004 grayson et al 1992 jain et al 2004 julien et al 1995 jung et al 2010 lópez barrera et al 2012 luo 2007 moretti and montanari 2007 but proper model selection should depend on the dominant hydrological processes in the research region the available data and the research questions beven 2001 daniel et al 2011 kampf and burges 2007 singh and woolhiser 2002 in addition not all hydrological models fit the typically high rain variability heterogeneous basin properties and local hydrological response of mediterranean basins merheb et al 2016 thus a new model that simulates the main hydrological processes detected in the research area fits the available data and allows for full control of the simulated processes and evaluation of the rca was developed 3 1 model description gb hydra is an event based distributed hydrological model that simulates various hydrological processes it consists of individual 1d hillslope and stream modules fig 3 and uses an adaptive time step 60 s the model allows flexibility in grid resolution and water balance components and can be monitored at each hillslope or stream cell for the current study a 5 m contour map was used to derive the digital elevation model grid dem the model grid was set to 100x100 m2 a preliminary test for the upper dalya basin indicated no substantial different in model performances with a 10 10 m2 and thus the lower resolution was chosen to ensure a reasonable computation time flow direction of each cell was calculated using eight direction d8 flow model jenson and domingeu 1988 hillslope and stream cells were differentiated by applying a threshold on the flow accumulation tarboton et al 1991 the stream delineationwas tested against maps air photos and field observations hydrological processes that are known to have only a minor effect on flash flood peak discharge in the study region were not represented in the model specifically channel transmission losses were not accounted for due to their minor role in mediterranean regions morin et al 2009 the interflow process was also excluded even though it was observed at distinct places between the soil profile and the bedrock near the research area grodek et al 2012 nevertheless it appears to contribute to the hydrograph s slow recession limb but to have only a minor influence on the flood peak discharge blöschl et al 2013 it should be noted that in some mediterranean areas interflow can play a fundamental role in runoff and rca generation merheb et al 2016 in such cases some model modification would be required base flow contribution in the region has a negligible effect on peak discharge and therefore it was not included in the model evapotranspiration from the soil was included in the model to account for soil drying during long events with breaks between rain showers but was found to have a negligible effect on flood peak 3 1 1 hillslope runoff module a grid based water budget was calculated at each time step by accounting for hillslope routing soil water content actual evaporation and infiltration rate the formulation presented in moretti and montanari 2007 was followed with minor modifications to calculate the infiltration and reinfiltration on the hillslopes this was done by applying a modified version of the soil conservation service scs conceptual infiltration method chow et al 1988 s c s 1972 the method s strength lies in its simplicity and in the low requirements in terms of parameters and soil measurements hawkins 2009 mishra and singh 2004 pronce et al 1996 soulis et al 2009 the method was originally developed to account for the direct runoff depth of an entire single storm chow et al 1988 s c s 1964 however it was modified over the years and adjusted to deal with various scenarios such as varied antecedent moisture conditions evapotranspiration long term continuous simulations and distributed hydrological models e g durbude et al 2011 geetha et al 2007 hawkins 2009 mishra et al 2003 moretti and montanari 2007 the method has been extensively used in various climatic regimes including the mediterranean climate e g borga et al 2007 durbude et al 2011 merheb et al 2016 morin et al 2007 petroselli et al 2013 rozalis et al 2010 soulis et al 2009 the explicit water budget equations for each hillslope grid cell i and time step t are presented below following moretti and montanari 2007 for simplicity all units have been converted to si maximal soil storage s0 m is calculated using the following equation 1 s 0 i 254 1000 100 cn i 1 where the scs curve number parameter cn is obtained by accounting for soil type and land use of each cell mishra and

t aet m s 1 is actual evapotranspiration rate and δths s is the adaptive hillslope time step the original model by moretti and montanari 2007 includes an additional term accounting for subsurface flow however as noted above it is excluded here due to its minor effect on flash flood peak discharge aet is calculated using an estimated daily potential evaporation rate for each time step t petday m s 1

model application the arcmap gis program was used to prepare the spatial data including topography stream network soil dan et al 1975 and land use a smoothing procedure was applied to correct and eliminate artificial jumps in the stream profiles and reduce numerical instabilities peckham 2009 stream width was calculated after fitting a power law function montgomery and gran 2001 shamir et al 2013 between the measured width dependent variable and the drainage area independent variable hillslope cn values and manning roughness coefficients were determined from published tables downer and ogden 2002 engman 1986 mishra and singh 2003 based on soil and land use maps table 4 manning roughness coefficient for all streams was assumed to be uniform and equal to 0 035 s m 1 3 this is acceptable because the stream channels are situated in a relatively homogeneous terrain excluding sparse sections that are limited to short road culverts this value is in agreement with other studies in the region arbel et al 2008 grodek et al 2012 three guidelines were followed to ensure numerical stability i a predictor corrector approach william 1977 ii an adaptive time step 60 s was continuously calculated such that the courant friedrichs lewy stability criterion was maintained press et al 1992 in iterations where this condition was not fulfilled the time step was reduced by 5 and the iteration was repeated iii a kinematic wave approximation chow et al 1988 was applied at stream junction cells to avoid backwater flow into the neighboring stream 3 3 computation of rca extent the rca is defined here as the hillslope grid cells whose surface water eventually reaches the stream network since transmission losses are not considered here reaching the stream network and reaching the basin outlet are equivalent to compute the rca the connectivity between each pair of neighboring hillslope cells was evaluated using a threshold for the overland discharge the 5 min maximum local outflow discharge was calculated and cells with values higher than the threshold were marked as active the identified active cells that had a continuous spatial connection to the stream network were defined as the rca ambroise 2004 to select the threshold 20 values ranging from 1e 7 to 1 m2 s 1 were used to recalculate peak discharge and rca extent for all studied cases in these runs any hillslope discharge lower than the tested threshold was temporarily set to zero and the contribution of non active cells to the peak discharge was eliminated a threshold that did not change the peak discharge value but adequately represented rca extent was identified in this way a high threshold i e 1 m2 s 1 resulted in virtually zero peak discharge and zero rca extent values whereas for the low threshold i e 1e 7 m2 s 1 the peak discharge was not affected and rca extent was close to 100 of the basin area rca extent seemed to be sensitive to the selected threshold for low and high values and to stabilize at the moderate ones in this stabilized range of threshold values the highest possible threshold 1e 5 m2 s 1 that had a minor impact 5 on the peak discharge was selected 3 4 model performance gb hydra s ability to adequately simulate flash flood peak discharge was tested against 59 measured values from hydrometric stations at the outlet of each basin and 7 from the post event analysis fig 4 root mean square difference rmsd and bias of 16 and 2 5 m3 s 1 respectively and r2 of 0 77 suggested that the model reasonably estimates peak discharge the reasonable fit obtained for the 7 ungauged points with sub basin sizes of 4 5 40 km2 5 of them 15 km2 using post event survey data suggested that gb hydra adequately simulates runoff at intra basin locations as well in moretti and montanari 2007 model the maximal soil storage in eq 1 is multiplied by a correction factor that can be found through calibration however optimization procedures that were initially applied showed no improvement in model performance not shown therefore gb hydra was left in a robust uncalibrated form evaluating the simulated rca extent is more difficult as no ground truth data are available a positive indication of adequate rca assessment was provided by the comparison of pictures taken during the december 2012 storm and the rca simulation for the same time fig 5 for example overland surface runoff on a cultivated field in upper dalya fig 5b and in the resultant stream flow fig 5c matched the spatial rca extent fig 5f no runoff contribution was evident from a partly forested hill in the upper taninim basin fig 5d as indicated by the model simulation of rca extent fig 5g while the stream flow at the foot of the hill fig 5e indicated the rca from upstream parts sensitivity of the modeled peak discharge and its associated rca extent see section 4 2 was tested by changing the stream manning roughness hillslope manning roughness and channel threshold values by 10 and by changing cn values over the reported range for each land use mishra and singh 2003 changes in the first three quantities resulted in variations of no more than 1 in the modeled peak discharge and 3 in the associated rca extent whereas changes in cn values resulted in a 15 change in peak discharge and 12 change in the associated rca extent the relatively low sensitivity provides additional support for the model s reliability and robustness 4 main factors controlling basin peak discharge 4 1 rain intensity rca dynamics and their relation to peak discharge as a first step the intra storm dynamics of rca extent and rain intensity were qualitatively analyzed as depicted in fig 6 after a certain period of rainfall rca extent increases followed by initiation of outlet discharge events could be categorized into two types of runoff response although a combination of both was also observed rainfall intensity dominated and rca extent dominated the two storms that occurred in the upper dalya basin fig 6a b are an excellent example of the first type similar rca extents were observed prior to peak time for the two events 38 and 37 km2 close to the basin size of 42 km2 but maximal basin averaged rain intensities were different 53 and 24 mm h 1 leading to large differences in the modeled 130 and 56 m3 s 1 respectively and measured peak discharges furthermore during the extreme storm of february 1995 fig 6a high values of rca extent were maintained for more than 30 h leaving the rain intensity to control the discharge an example of the second type is presented in fig 6c d where different modeled peak discharges 70 and 10 m3 s 1 were associated with different rca extents prior to the peak 55 and 17 km2 respectively while the basin averaged rainfall intensity was similar 4 2 irca and peak discharge the above observations suggest that both rca extent and rain intensity control the peak discharge this raises the question of whether these properties can provide quantitative information on peak discharge we consider a linear relationship between peak outflow discharge and the peak inflow water flux represented by the maximal averaged rainfall intensity multiplied by the basin area in a given time window that precedes the peak the time of concentration of the basin is a reasonable first guess for this time window a simple method was adopted to calculate this parameter for the studied basins fang et al 2008 gericke and smithers 2014 johnstone and cross 1949 resulting in values ranging from 80 to 120 min table 1 to identify the specific rainfall intensity responsible for the peak discharge the rain intensities in the 3 h preceding the peak were explored this was done by taking the maximal basin averaged rain intensity calculated using a moving time window of the size of the time of concentration a 3 h time interval was chosen so that on the one hand it would be larger than the time of concentration but on other not too large to avoid sampling additional flood peaks the correlation between the measured peak discharge and the maximal rain intensity averaged over the basin during the time of concentration multiplied by basin area fig 7 a was poor r2 0 16 in fact one of the basic assumptions behind this idea was that the entire basin contributes runoff that reaches the outlet while reasonable for small homogeneous basins this is not often the case for larger basins particularly if characterized by different land uses and variable rainfall therefore rather than examine the entire basin we focused only on basin areas that contribute runoff during a given time window and the rainfall over the contributing area consequently we define here a new index irca m3 s 1 12 i r c a m a x p t τ a t τ p e a k t i m e 3 h t p e a k t i m e where t is a 5 min time step time resolution of the measured rain and rca τ s is the time window used for the calculation a t τ m2 is the rca extent for a time window τ ending at time step t i e t τ to t and p t τ m s 1 is the average rain intensity over this rca and for time window τ ending at time step t the new irca index is taken as the maximum of the product of p t τ and a t τ over the 3 h interval preceding the peak discharge finally we define peak rca extent as rca extent at the time in which irca is maximized using the catchment concentration time table 1 as the time window the linear correlation between observed peak discharge and the new irca index was found to be substantially higher than that with basin averaged rain intensity multiplied by basin size fig 7b r2 0 57 however the characteristic time plays a fundamental role in the definition of the irca index and our first guess i e the time of concentration might not be the best choice therefore we reevaluated this parameter by searching for the time window that maximizes the correlation between observed peak discharge and irca this procedure was applied with time windows ranging from 10 to 140 min both for each basin separately and for all basins and events grouped together fisher z transformation alder and roessler 1977 udny yule and kendall 1965 was used to test the significance of the difference between the calculated correlations the basin specific time windows were not found to be significantly different from the mutual one and thus a mutual value was chosen fig 8 a shows the correlations found for the range of time windows using the same window for all basins maximal r2 was attributed to a time window of 50 min r2 0 64 fig 8b although this value was not found to be statistically significantly better than a range of values between 20 and 75 min it was found to provide significantly better results than the time of concentration when taken for each basin separately this implies that for the examined basins the characteristic time scale of the dominant hillslope runoff processes associated with the outlet peak discharge is around 50 min and that the suggested index when used on this time scale is able to explain 64 of the variance in the measured peak discharge 5 controls of peak discharge magnitude to study the main factors controlling peak discharge magnitude the flash flood events were classified as moderate large and extreme section 2 3 and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively the extreme group consisted of only three cases all from the same rainstorm and thus for the quantitative analysis it was merged with the large magnitude group large extreme group we used t test alder and roessler 1977 to determine whether the mean value of the examined properties is significantly different between the moderate and large extreme groups properties marked by peak prefix occurred prior to the peak discharge and are averaged over the 50 min time window defined in the previous section 5 1 basin averaged storm rain depth fig 9a as expected the large extreme group was characterized by statistically significantly p value 0 001 greater rain depths than the moderate group in addition the three extreme events were characterized by total rain depth exceeding 160 mm whereas moderate and large events were generated by a wide range of storm rain depths fig 9 a 5 2 basin averaged soil water storage prior to storm and peak fig 9b soil water storage is defined here as the basin averaged percentage of soil water content s out of the maximal soil storage s0 no significant difference p value 0 6 in pre storm soil water storage between moderate and large extreme events was observed on the other hand large differences were observed in the peak soil water storage with a significantly p value 0 01 lower peak soil water storage for the moderate group the substantial increase 170 in soil water storage from storm beginning to flood peak generation can be appreciated from fig 9b pre storm values of extreme magnitude events are similar to the other cases while their peak values are the largest 5 3 basin rainfall coverage fig 9c the basin areal fraction of peak rain peak wet area ratio and peak rca extent were statistically significantly different p value 0 001 in both cases between the two groups and to increase with magnitude moderate events were characterized by a wide range of peak rain coverage values whereas large extreme events were found to occur only with high values 70 the ratio between the areal coverage of peak rain and peak rca extent can indicate how effectively the rainfall is for moderate events 50 of the average peak rain was converted to peak rca indicating a lower effectiveness compared to large extreme events where the conversion was more than 80 in addition the events of extreme magnitude were characterized by high 100 peak rca extent i e the whole basin contributed runoff to the peak discharge 5 4 peak rca rain intensity fig 9d and the percentage of convective rain over peak rca extent fig 9e the effect shown above can be explained by further analyzing the rainfall falling on the peak rca extent both the average rain intensities on the peak rca extent fig 9d and its convective portion fig 9e were found to significantly p value 0 01 and 0 03 respectively increase with magnitude convective rain is defined as a 5 min rain intensity of at least 10 mm h 1 based on previous studies in the area peleg and morin 2012 5 5 the contribution of land use to outlet peak discharge fig 9f this is defined as the percentage of peak water volume contributed from each land use type out of the total water volume in the basin outlet during a time window of 50 min centered on the time of peak discharge cultivated fields uncultivated fields and rural residential areas are the most important contributors to the peak discharge this is not surprising as they cover 65 of the basins and are characterized by moderate cn values differences between the moderate and large extreme group were found to be significant in all cases p value 0 01 except for the cultivated fields p value 0 08 in general despite the areal coverage of the land use the relative contribution from land uses with low runoff potential groves and forests plantations and uncultivated fields was found to increase with event magnitude for example forests and plantations cover 35 of the basins but make a negligible contribution 10 in moderate events uncultivated fields cover 37 of the basins but contribute less than 10 in more than half of the moderate events on the other hand in the large extreme magnitude group their co contribution exceeds 50 of the peak discharge outflow volume during more than half of the events this general trend is even more enhanced in extreme events where in particular the contribution of forests becomes substantial 6 summary and discussion the present study investigates the relationships among basins rainfall properties and flash flood peak discharge while accounting for rcas using a new distributed hydrological model gb hydra in analyzing the contributions to peak discharge two main behaviors were identified rainfall intensity dominated and rca extent dominated in particular rainfall dominated behavior will occur when a large portion of the basin close to 100 contributes which is typical of extreme events in these cases the method presented in this paper concurs with the reasoning behind the rational formula chow et al 1988 however when the events are less intense and only part of the basin contributes runoff a new approach is needed following this insight we presented a new index irca that captures the relations among rain intensity rcas and peak discharge for a wide range of storms the observed peak discharge was found to be linearly related 64 of explained variance to this index 6 1 what affects flood magnitude initial soil water storage is often considered to be an important factor for runoff generation particularly in extreme events blöschl et al 2013 borga et al 2007 lana renault et al 2011 merheb et al 2016 merz and blöschl 2009 in this study pre storm soil water storage was found to be of minor importance fig 9b this is in agreement with studies suggesting that when rain intensities are high or when the soil is shallow and less permeable the role of initial soil moisture decreases castillo et al 2003 fitzjohn et al 1998 grillakis et al 2016 wood et al 1990 these principles were met in the research area which is characterized by intense convective rain cells peleg and morin 2012 and shallow soils rich in clay and silt singer 2007 in addition storm events in the region are not consecutive and long several days to 1 month dry spells goldreich 2003 allow for soil water storage to decrease and return to its typical inter storm values 50 10 however during the storm especially in events characterized by high rain depth soil moisture increases and reaches high values just before peak discharge 80 in moderate magnitude and 90 in large and extreme floods on average fig 9b there is a known connection between total rain depth and event magnitude or peak discharge blöschl et al 2013 merheb et al 2016 this finding was supported by this research as the rain depth in large extreme magnitude events was more than double that in moderate ones fig 9a however storm rain depth is not the only important rain property as various studies in mediterranean and arid environments claim that short duration maximal rain intensities also play a crucial role in flash flood occurrence belachsen et al 2017 bracken et al 2008 schick 1988 in this study we found that rain intensities differ between the two magnitude groups and increase from 3 to 14 mm h 1 on average fig 9d convective rain is not a prerequisite for large peak rca extent as it usually covers only a small portion of this area however greater convective rain coverage is associated with greater flood magnitude fig 9e the relative contribution of peak rca extent to peak discharge was also found to be associated with land use type fig 9e in general the dominant land uses in the research site seem to be the rural residential area and the cultivated and uncultivated fields contribution from groves and forests plantations and uncultivated fields mainly occurs during events of large and extreme magnitudes thus reinforcing previous results liu et al 2006 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 extreme events occur under rare hydrometeorological conditions in which intense rain storms interact with basin characteristics such that the generated flow magnitude is maximized these events are of special hydrological and applicative interest as during these events some of the hydrological properties that normally have a minor effect are revealed archer et al 2007 borga et al 2008 marchi et al 2010 in this study a single storm generated an extreme hydrological response in three of the four basins studied in these events the pre storm soil water storage was similar to the other cases 48 but increased substantially during the event and reached high pre peak values 94 due to high total rain depth 160 mm these extreme events were also accompanied by high areal rain coverage 92 and intense rain basin average 16 mm h 1 local maximal average 185 mm h 1 and 16 coverage of convective rainfall over peak rca extent in addition during the analyzed extreme events 100 of the basin contributed prior to peak occurrence and basin areas characterized by land use types with low runoff potential and normally low contribution to peak discharge became much more dominant for example 20 of the runoff came from grove and forested areas compared to 10 in large events 6 2 peak time window irca and peak rca extent calculations require the definition of a time window representing a characteristic response time intuitively this quantity should be related to the time of concentration as it accounts for the duration of water to travel from the basin s furthest point to the outlet chow et al 1988 however findings in this study suggest that the time window of interest should also be related to the typical rainfall properties in the study region the time of concentration is related to continuous and uniform rainfall occurrence chow et al 1988 viessman and lewis 2002 however when the duration of high rain intensities is shorter than the time of concentration the basin s theoretical maximal peak discharge is not achieved in this case the resultant peak discharge is lower than maximal the actual basin response time is shorter and the rain duration becomes the dominant factor eagleson 1970 this might be the case in the research area as the flash flood producing rain cells belachsen et al 2017 doswell et al 1996 smith et al 2000 yakir and morin 2011 have a much shorter residence time peleg and morin 2012 than the time of concentration it is thus suggested that in the case of the studied events the hydrological response time at peak occurrence may not be controlled by the basin properties but by those of the rain 6 3 linearity of basin response hydrological processes are nonlinear in nature due to threshold behaviors and nonlinearities in routing processes antecedent moisture conditions channel transmission losses interaction between the surface and subsurface and the different time scales associated with each process beven 2001 goodrich et al 1997 vivoni et al 2007 in particular rogger et al 2012 ali and roy 2010 and dickinson and whiteley 1970 found nonlinear behavior of discharge with increasing rca despite this inherent nonlinear behavior linear models such as the unit hydrograph unit transfer functions and rational formula have been successfully applied for simplified hydrological calculations brutsaert 2005 chow et al 1988 this is because a close to linear relationship does exist between the effective rainfall and the resulting discharge beven 2001 iacobellis and fiorentino 2000 the focus of this research was on the peak discharge and its occurrence at the climax of the hydrological response during this time rain over the peak rca extent turns into runoff infiltration losses are minor and the system moves toward the linear relationship found between peak discharge and effective rainfall over the rca extent represented by the irca index the similarity of this relationship s characteristics among all examined basins is probably due to their similar lithological soil and morphological properties as well as the similar rain storm properties goldreich 2003 peleg and morin 2012 singer 2007 sneh et al 1998 7 conclusions a grid based distributed hydrological runoff model gb hydra and a novel index irca were developed and used in four mediterranean rural medium size basins this application helped identify and study the dominant factors controlling peak discharge the main conclusions of this study are using parameter values from the literature gb hydra well predicts r2 0 77 flash flood peak discharge for a range of basin sizes 18 69 km2 and event magnitudes rca validation especially at a 5 minute time scale is a challenging task identification of flow no flow areas from pictures taken in a field survey during flood events and estimated peak discharge at internal basin locations using post event analysis provide direct and indirect support of the modeled rca the new proposed irca index defined as the multiplication of peak rca extent by rain intensity over the same area during a characteristic time window is linearly correlated with measured peak discharge r2 0 64 furthermore this linear relationship seems to hold across a wide range of event magnitudes and the four basins a characteristic time of 50 min optimized the above correlation for the studied cases this time scale is shorter than the basins time of concentration probably due to the typically shorter durations of runoff producing rainfall in the region soil water storage prior to a storm is not significantly different between moderate and large extreme flood magnitudes however it increases during the storm and this difference becomes significant when considered prior to the flood peak total storm rain depths rainfall coverage area rca extent and fraction of convective rainfall over the rca increase significantly with event magnitude the storm of february 1995 resulted in extreme flash flood responses in three of the four studied basins it was characterized by convective rain and a total basin averaged rain depth exceeding 160 mm which resulted in high 94 pre peak soil water storage values and close to 100 peak rca extent in these cases runoff contribution from land uses with low runoff potential was dominant irca and peak rca indexes were found to be powerful tools and will be utilized in our future studies further research is required to better understand the nature of the peak

7046,during the complex dynamic interactions between rainfall and basin properties different portions of the basin produce runoff at different moments capturing this spatiotemporal variability is important for flood analysis but knowledge of this subject is limited the presented research aims at improving the understanding of runoff contributing areas rca hillslope sections from which water flows reaches the stream network and consequently the basin outlet and at examining their relationship with the magnitude of a flash flood s peak discharge a distributed hydrological model gb hydra that enables computing rca and flood discharge was developed the model was applied to four medium size basins 18 69 km2 in a mediterranean climate and 59 flash flood events were analyzed the correlation between basin input flux basin area multiplied by the basin maximal rain intensity averaged over the time of concentration and output flux observed peak discharge was poor r2 0 16 however using a newly developed index termed irca to calculate the input flux accounting only for the rca extent and rainfall intensity over it resulted in a substantially higher correlation r2 0 64 across a wide range of flood magnitudes the highest correlation was found using a 50 min time window which is shorter than the time of concentration flood events were categorized according to their magnitude and the differences of several factors among the groups were examined pre storm soil moisture content was found to be similar for all event magnitudes however pre peak soil moisture content was substantially different between moderate and large extreme events other important properties that differed between magnitudes were rca extent and its averaged rain intensity and ratio of convective rainfall finally areas with land uses characterized by low runoff potential became dominant and contributed mainly during large and extreme events although the rca and its extent full potential is yet to be fulfilled it is proposed as a significant tool for understanding processes of flash flood generation at the basin scale in future research keywords grid based hydrological model flash flood peak discharge control runoff contributing area radar rainfall mediterranean climate 1 introduction during flash flood events several intra basin processes are initiated generating an integrated outlet flow that reaches a climax represented by the peak discharge chow et al 1988 sene 2013 however not all basin areas are activated to the same extent or in the same moment moreover the runoff generated at a given location may reinfiltrate downstream instead of reaching the basin outlet chow et al 1988 consequently water contributing to the outlet peak discharge often comes only from a partial area of the basin although this behavior has been known for decades e g amerman 1965 betson 1964 dickinson and whiteley 1970 dunne and black 1970 ragan 1967 yair and lavee 1974 1981 an understanding of its basin scale manifestation and its effect on peak discharge magnitude is still lacking ambroise 2004 bracken and croke 2007 spence et al 2010 the runoff contributing area rca is the portion of the basin that produces or transports water that reaches the outlet ambroise 2004 bracken et al 2013 bracken and croke 2007 nippgen et al 2015 past studies have used several approaches to evaluate the rca including modeling beven and kirkby 1979 gioia et al 2017 reaney et al 2014 rogger et al 2012 satellite image analysis mengistu and spence 2016 phillips et al 2011 spence et al 2010 chemical tracers

1980 yair and lavee 1974 the rca varies in both space and time ambroise 2004 bracken et al 2013 and its spatial distribution and dynamics are highly related to rainfall soil moisture flow velocity and reinfiltration bracken and croke 2007 the distribution and main controlling factors of the rca depend on climatic regime fiorentino et al 2007 gioia et al 2017 iacobellis and fiorentino 2000 leh et al 2008 nippgen et al 2015 in humid climates the rca is usually identified as the riparian zones and the lower parts of the hillslopes whereas in mediterranean semi arid and arid climates its location and size are not confined to a particular part of the basin bracken and croke 2007 chow et al 1988 manus et al 2009 antecedent moisture conditions and land use type also affect the rca in humid and mediterranean climates antecedent moisture condition is a dominant factor in runoff occurrence borga et al 2007 lana renault et al 2011 merz and blöschl 2009 sene 2013 tarolli et al 2012 vivoni et al 2007 urban areas make a relatively high runoff contribution in storms with low antecedent moisture conditions and low peak discharge whereas the contribution from crops and grassland increases in large storms liu et al 2006 forests make a high contribution compared to agricultural areas for events with high peak discharge but their contribution decreases during events of smaller magnitude liu et al 2006 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 the spatiotemporal properties of rainfall play a major role in runoff generation and flash flood characteristics particularly with the shallow soils of the mediterranean basin blöschl and sivapalan 1997 borga et al 2007 brath and montanari 2000 lana renault et al 2011 merheb et al 2016 robinson and sivapalan 1997 extreme flash floods are often associated with short and intense storms archer et al 2007 borga et al 2007 delrieu et al 2005 marchi et al 2010 during which multiple convective rain cells result in large rainfall amounts over small areas directly contributing to intensification of the basin response chappell 1986 doswell et al 1996 yakir and morin 2011 several studies have analyzed the interaction between rainfall properties and basin attributes in relation to peak discharge runoff volume and peak discharge have been found to depend on the areal coverage position velocity and direction of the rain cells as well as on the rain intensity and the storm s rain depth and duration e g borga et al 2008 creutin and borga 2003 giannoni et al 2003 karklinsky and morin 2006 merheb et al 2016 morin et al 2006 morin and yakir 2014 seo et al 2012 syed et al 2003 volpi et al 2013 wright et al 2013 zoccatelli et al 2011 envelope curves often suggest a power law relationship between the largest possible flood peak discharge and basin size within a similar climatic region e g borga and morin 2014 gaume et al 2016 herschy 2002 marchi et al 2016 merheb et al 2016 beven and kirkby 1979 calculated local hillslope runoff by multiplying the area that drains to a certain location and the instantaneous rain over it efforts have also been made to relate the peak discharge to rca extent and nippgen et al 2015 reaney et al 2014 and rogger et al 2012 indicated a complicated basin rca dynamics mengistu and spence 2016 found an individual power law relationship in each nested basin but concluded that in their research area no single relationship exists another example of a similar approach is the basic and still widely used rational formula although developed for small urban basins the method has also been successfully applied to medium size rural basins blöschl et al 2013 brutsaert 2005 chow et al 1988 mujumdar and nagesh kumar 2012 the method relates peak discharge to maximal rain intensity of a given return period by multiplying a runoff coefficient the basin size and the maximal basin averaged rain intensity for a typical time commonly taken as the time of concentration brutsaert 2005 chow et al 1988 gericke and smithers 2014 viessman and lewis 2002 this characteristic time is also a crucial factor in evaluating rca extent as it can be estimated over various time scales such as seasonal latron and gallart

extend the knowledge of these complex interactions focusing on rca rain intensity and peak discharge the following research questions are addressed i what is the rca dynamics during flash flood events ii what is the correlation between peak discharge and the multiplication of rca extent and rain intensity over it and for which time scale is it optimized iii are flash floods of different magnitudes

region northern israel were used for this research ada upper taninim upper dalya and lower dalya fig 1 the area is characterized by a hilly terrain with moderate to steep hillslopes 3 45 with steeper sections in the upper parts of ada and upper taninim basins and in the lower parts of upper and lower dalya basins the lithology of the region is dominated by the chalks of the lower eocene adulam formation where at the southeastern part of the research area the chalks and marls of the paleocene taqiye formation are exposed grodek et al 2012 peleg et al 2015 sneh et al 1998 the area is covered by rendzina soils singer 2007 but in several distinct locations on the ridges the soil is absent revealing patches of bedrock dan et al 1975 grodek et al 2012 the entire area is subject to severe soil erosion due to intensive cultivation as a result the average soil depth on the hillslopes is 30 10 cm with some of the hillslopes having a thinner soil cover 10 cm a detailed land use map fig 1 was produced at a resolution of 10 m using recent aerial photographs and field surveys land use observed to be rather stable during the research years 1990 2013 includes uncultivated 37 and cultivated 16 fields groves and forests 20 plantations 15 and a rural residential area small sparsely distributed family houses with open grass yards and cultivated areas between them 10 channel depths and widths were measured in 43 locations in all four basins and extrapolated to gain a comprehensive assessment of the stream network and cross sectional properties rainfall in the area generally occurs between october and may the mean annual rainfall is 660 mm where 60 70 of it occurs during the winter from december to february and the mean number of rainy days is 60 israel meteorological service the mean annual potential evaporation is 1900 mm and during the winter months the average is 70 mm per month goldreich 2003 rainstorms are mainly 94 of mediterranean origin peleg and morin 2012 and usually last from several hours to a few days goldreich 2003 the entire area is prone to flash floods of different magnitudes on average 7 events in a year the maximal recorded specific peak discharge is of 3 3 m3 s 1 km 2 and extreme events in the region occasionally result in casualties and damage grodek et al 2012 inbar 2018 morin et al 2007 the common hydrograph shape is characterized by a fast rising limb tens of minutes to several hours and a slower recession time that can last over a day fig 2 a 2 2 hydrometeorological data the area is covered by a c band non doppler weather radar situated 60 70 km to the south of the research area shacham mekorot fig 1 rainfall estimates from the radar are available at 1 km2 5 min resolution for the period 1990 2013 marra and morin 2015 the quantitative estimates were obtained by applying a set of physically based corrections to the measured reflectivity antenna pointing ground echoes wet radome attenuation beam blockage attenuation and vertical profile reflectivity a fixed z r relationship z 316r1 5 was used to derive rain intensity and an upper threshold of 150 mm h 1 was set to reduce the possible impact of hail marra and morin 2015 followed by an annual range dependent gauge adjustment morin and gabella 2007 for the present study an additional mean field bias adjustment was applied for each storm using data from 14 to 20 daily rain gauges situated near the research area israel meteorological service data from these daily rain gauges were also used to evaluate the initial soil moisture conditions for each rainstorm monthly climatological potential evaporation rates goldreich 2003 and 10 min temperature data from three weather stations in the region were used to assess potential daily evaporation rates measured streamflow discharge data israel hydrological service are available from four hydrometric stations located at basin outlets fig 1 and operating from 1956 to 1968 to the present an additional seven peak discharge estimations are available at ungauged locations with drainage areas of 4 5 40 km2 fig 1 from two post event surveys table 2 arazi et al 2002 garti et al 1995 2 3 event selection and categorization a quality check was applied to all available radar and discharge data events with non continuous radar images or a local gauge adjustment correction factor 0 4 or 1 6 were excluded as well as cases in which the discharge data were reported to be of low quality based on the recurrence interval of the observed peak discharges see thresholds in table 1 and fig 2b the events were classified as low 2 years moderate 2 10 years large 10 50 years and extreme 50 years recurrence intervals were estimated by fitting a generalized extreme value gev distribution haan and charles 2002 to the annual maximum measured peak discharges records for 50 68 years depending on the basin fig 2b 3 extreme events 12 large ones and 44 moderate ones were found to match the above criteria and were selected for further analysis table 3 while low events were excluded from this research 3 grid based hydrological distributed runoff gb hydra model the use of a distributed hydrological model is essential when runoff response is driven by the high spatial heterogeneity of rainfall and or of basin properties downer et al 2002 fatichi et al 2016 grayson and bloschl 2000 merheb et al 2016 moretti and montanari 2007 different distributed models have been developed in recent years e g downer et al 2002 downer and ogden 2004 grayson et al 1992 jain et al 2004 julien et al 1995 jung et al 2010 lópez barrera et al 2012 luo 2007 moretti and montanari 2007 but proper model selection should depend on the dominant hydrological processes in the research region the available data and the research questions beven 2001 daniel et al 2011 kampf and burges 2007 singh and woolhiser 2002 in addition not all hydrological models fit the typically high rain variability heterogeneous basin properties and local hydrological response of mediterranean basins merheb et al 2016 thus a new model that simulates the main hydrological processes detected in the research area fits the available data and allows for full control of the simulated processes and evaluation of the rca was developed 3 1 model description gb hydra is an event based distributed hydrological model that simulates various hydrological processes it consists of individual 1d hillslope and stream modules fig 3 and uses an adaptive time step 60 s the model allows flexibility in grid resolution and water balance components and can be monitored at each hillslope or stream cell for the current study a 5 m contour map was used to derive the digital elevation model grid dem the model grid was set to 100x100 m2 a preliminary test for the upper dalya basin indicated no substantial different in model performances with a 10 10 m2 and thus the lower resolution was chosen to ensure a reasonable computation time flow direction of each cell was calculated using eight direction d8 flow model jenson and domingeu 1988 hillslope and stream cells were differentiated by applying a threshold on the flow accumulation tarboton et al 1991 the stream delineationwas tested against maps air photos and field observations hydrological processes that are known to have only a minor effect on flash flood peak discharge in the study region were not represented in the model specifically channel transmission losses were not accounted for due to their minor role in mediterranean regions morin et al 2009 the interflow process was also excluded even though it was observed at distinct places between the soil profile and the bedrock near the research area grodek et al 2012 nevertheless it appears to contribute to the hydrograph s slow recession limb but to have only a minor influence on the flood peak discharge blöschl et al 2013 it should be noted that in some mediterranean areas interflow can play a fundamental role in runoff and rca generation merheb et al 2016 in such cases some model modification would be required base flow contribution in the region has a negligible effect on peak discharge and therefore it was not included in the model evapotranspiration from the soil was included in the model to account for soil drying during long events with breaks between rain showers but was found to have a negligible effect on flood peak 3 1 1 hillslope runoff module a grid based water budget was calculated at each time step by accounting for hillslope routing soil water content actual evaporation and infiltration rate the formulation presented in moretti and montanari 2007 was followed with minor modifications to calculate the infiltration and reinfiltration on the hillslopes this was done by applying a modified version of the soil conservation service scs conceptual infiltration method chow et al 1988 s c s 1972 the method s strength lies in its simplicity and in the low requirements in terms of parameters and soil measurements hawkins 2009 mishra and singh 2004 pronce et al 1996 soulis et al 2009 the method was originally developed to account for the direct runoff depth of an entire single storm chow et al 1988 s c s 1964 however it was modified over the years and adjusted to deal with various scenarios such as varied antecedent moisture conditions evapotranspiration long term continuous simulations and distributed hydrological models e g durbude et al 2011 geetha et al 2007 hawkins 2009 mishra et al 2003 moretti and montanari 2007 the method has been extensively used in various climatic regimes including the mediterranean climate e g borga et al 2007 durbude et al 2011 merheb et al 2016 morin et al 2007 petroselli et al 2013 rozalis et al 2010 soulis et al 2009 the explicit water budget equations for each hillslope grid cell i and time step t are presented below following moretti and montanari 2007 for simplicity all units have been converted to si maximal soil storage s0 m is calculated using the following equation 1 s 0 i 254 1000 100 cn i 1 where the scs curve number parameter cn is obtained by accounting for soil type and land use of each cell mishra and

t aet m s 1 is actual evapotranspiration rate and δths s is the adaptive hillslope time step the original model by moretti and montanari 2007 includes an additional term accounting for subsurface flow however as noted above it is excluded here due to its minor effect on flash flood peak discharge aet is calculated using an estimated daily potential evaporation rate for each time step t petday m s 1

model application the arcmap gis program was used to prepare the spatial data including topography stream network soil dan et al 1975 and land use a smoothing procedure was applied to correct and eliminate artificial jumps in the stream profiles and reduce numerical instabilities peckham 2009 stream width was calculated after fitting a power law function montgomery and gran 2001 shamir et al 2013 between the measured width dependent variable and the drainage area independent variable hillslope cn values and manning roughness coefficients were determined from published tables downer and ogden 2002 engman 1986 mishra and singh 2003 based on soil and land use maps table 4 manning roughness coefficient for all streams was assumed to be uniform and equal to 0 035 s m 1 3 this is acceptable because the stream channels are situated in a relatively homogeneous terrain excluding sparse sections that are limited to short road culverts this value is in agreement with other studies in the region arbel et al 2008 grodek et al 2012 three guidelines were followed to ensure numerical stability i a predictor corrector approach william 1977 ii an adaptive time step 60 s was continuously calculated such that the courant friedrichs lewy stability criterion was maintained press et al 1992 in iterations where this condition was not fulfilled the time step was reduced by 5 and the iteration was repeated iii a kinematic wave approximation chow et al 1988 was applied at stream junction cells to avoid backwater flow into the neighboring stream 3 3 computation of rca extent the rca is defined here as the hillslope grid cells whose surface water eventually reaches the stream network since transmission losses are not considered here reaching the stream network and reaching the basin outlet are equivalent to compute the rca the connectivity between each pair of neighboring hillslope cells was evaluated using a threshold for the overland discharge the 5 min maximum local outflow discharge was calculated and cells with values higher than the threshold were marked as active the identified active cells that had a continuous spatial connection to the stream network were defined as the rca ambroise 2004 to select the threshold 20 values ranging from 1e 7 to 1 m2 s 1 were used to recalculate peak discharge and rca extent for all studied cases in these runs any hillslope discharge lower than the tested threshold was temporarily set to zero and the contribution of non active cells to the peak discharge was eliminated a threshold that did not change the peak discharge value but adequately represented rca extent was identified in this way a high threshold i e 1 m2 s 1 resulted in virtually zero peak discharge and zero rca extent values whereas for the low threshold i e 1e 7 m2 s 1 the peak discharge was not affected and rca extent was close to 100 of the basin area rca extent seemed to be sensitive to the selected threshold for low and high values and to stabilize at the moderate ones in this stabilized range of threshold values the highest possible threshold 1e 5 m2 s 1 that had a minor impact 5 on the peak discharge was selected 3 4 model performance gb hydra s ability to adequately simulate flash flood peak discharge was tested against 59 measured values from hydrometric stations at the outlet of each basin and 7 from the post event analysis fig 4 root mean square difference rmsd and bias of 16 and 2 5 m3 s 1 respectively and r2 of 0 77 suggested that the model reasonably estimates peak discharge the reasonable fit obtained for the 7 ungauged points with sub basin sizes of 4 5 40 km2 5 of them 15 km2 using post event survey data suggested that gb hydra adequately simulates runoff at intra basin locations as well in moretti and montanari 2007 model the maximal soil storage in eq 1 is multiplied by a correction factor that can be found through calibration however optimization procedures that were initially applied showed no improvement in model performance not shown therefore gb hydra was left in a robust uncalibrated form evaluating the simulated rca extent is more difficult as no ground truth data are available a positive indication of adequate rca assessment was provided by the comparison of pictures taken during the december 2012 storm and the rca simulation for the same time fig 5 for example overland surface runoff on a cultivated field in upper dalya fig 5b and in the resultant stream flow fig 5c matched the spatial rca extent fig 5f no runoff contribution was evident from a partly forested hill in the upper taninim basin fig 5d as indicated by the model simulation of rca extent fig 5g while the stream flow at the foot of the hill fig 5e indicated the rca from upstream parts sensitivity of the modeled peak discharge and its associated rca extent see section 4 2 was tested by changing the stream manning roughness hillslope manning roughness and channel threshold values by 10 and by changing cn values over the reported range for each land use mishra and singh 2003 changes in the first three quantities resulted in variations of no more than 1 in the modeled peak discharge and 3 in the associated rca extent whereas changes in cn values resulted in a 15 change in peak discharge and 12 change in the associated rca extent the relatively low sensitivity provides additional support for the model s reliability and robustness 4 main factors controlling basin peak discharge 4 1 rain intensity rca dynamics and their relation to peak discharge as a first step the intra storm dynamics of rca extent and rain intensity were qualitatively analyzed as depicted in fig 6 after a certain period of rainfall rca extent increases followed by initiation of outlet discharge events could be categorized into two types of runoff response although a combination of both was also observed rainfall intensity dominated and rca extent dominated the two storms that occurred in the upper dalya basin fig 6a b are an excellent example of the first type similar rca extents were observed prior to peak time for the two events 38 and 37 km2 close to the basin size of 42 km2 but maximal basin averaged rain intensities were different 53 and 24 mm h 1 leading to large differences in the modeled 130 and 56 m3 s 1 respectively and measured peak discharges furthermore during the extreme storm of february 1995 fig 6a high values of rca extent were maintained for more than 30 h leaving the rain intensity to control the discharge an example of the second type is presented in fig 6c d where different modeled peak discharges 70 and 10 m3 s 1 were associated with different rca extents prior to the peak 55 and 17 km2 respectively while the basin averaged rainfall intensity was similar 4 2 irca and peak discharge the above observations suggest that both rca extent and rain intensity control the peak discharge this raises the question of whether these properties can provide quantitative information on peak discharge we consider a linear relationship between peak outflow discharge and the peak inflow water flux represented by the maximal averaged rainfall intensity multiplied by the basin area in a given time window that precedes the peak the time of concentration of the basin is a reasonable first guess for this time window a simple method was adopted to calculate this parameter for the studied basins fang et al 2008 gericke and smithers 2014 johnstone and cross 1949 resulting in values ranging from 80 to 120 min table 1 to identify the specific rainfall intensity responsible for the peak discharge the rain intensities in the 3 h preceding the peak were explored this was done by taking the maximal basin averaged rain intensity calculated using a moving time window of the size of the time of concentration a 3 h time interval was chosen so that on the one hand it would be larger than the time of concentration but on other not too large to avoid sampling additional flood peaks the correlation between the measured peak discharge and the maximal rain intensity averaged over the basin during the time of concentration multiplied by basin area fig 7 a was poor r2 0 16 in fact one of the basic assumptions behind this idea was that the entire basin contributes runoff that reaches the outlet while reasonable for small homogeneous basins this is not often the case for larger basins particularly if characterized by different land uses and variable rainfall therefore rather than examine the entire basin we focused only on basin areas that contribute runoff during a given time window and the rainfall over the contributing area consequently we define here a new index irca m3 s 1 12 i r c a m a x p t τ a t τ p e a k t i m e 3 h t p e a k t i m e where t is a 5 min time step time resolution of the measured rain and rca τ s is the time window used for the calculation a t τ m2 is the rca extent for a time window τ ending at time step t i e t τ to t and p t τ m s 1 is the average rain intensity over this rca and for time window τ ending at time step t the new irca index is taken as the maximum of the product of p t τ and a t τ over the 3 h interval preceding the peak discharge finally we define peak rca extent as rca extent at the time in which irca is maximized using the catchment concentration time table 1 as the time window the linear correlation between observed peak discharge and the new irca index was found to be substantially higher than that with basin averaged rain intensity multiplied by basin size fig 7b r2 0 57 however the characteristic time plays a fundamental role in the definition of the irca index and our first guess i e the time of concentration might not be the best choice therefore we reevaluated this parameter by searching for the time window that maximizes the correlation between observed peak discharge and irca this procedure was applied with time windows ranging from 10 to 140 min both for each basin separately and for all basins and events grouped together fisher z transformation alder and roessler 1977 udny yule and kendall 1965 was used to test the significance of the difference between the calculated correlations the basin specific time windows were not found to be significantly different from the mutual one and thus a mutual value was chosen fig 8 a shows the correlations found for the range of time windows using the same window for all basins maximal r2 was attributed to a time window of 50 min r2 0 64 fig 8b although this value was not found to be statistically significantly better than a range of values between 20 and 75 min it was found to provide significantly better results than the time of concentration when taken for each basin separately this implies that for the examined basins the characteristic time scale of the dominant hillslope runoff processes associated with the outlet peak discharge is around 50 min and that the suggested index when used on this time scale is able to explain 64 of the variance in the measured peak discharge 5 controls of peak discharge magnitude to study the main factors controlling peak discharge magnitude the flash flood events were classified as moderate large and extreme section 2 3 and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively the extreme group consisted of only three cases all from the same rainstorm and thus for the quantitative analysis it was merged with the large magnitude group large extreme group we used t test alder and roessler 1977 to determine whether the mean value of the examined properties is significantly different between the moderate and large extreme groups properties marked by peak prefix occurred prior to the peak discharge and are averaged over the 50 min time window defined in the previous section 5 1 basin averaged storm rain depth fig 9a as expected the large extreme group was characterized by statistically significantly p value 0 001 greater rain depths than the moderate group in addition the three extreme events were characterized by total rain depth exceeding 160 mm whereas moderate and large events were generated by a wide range of storm rain depths fig 9 a 5 2 basin averaged soil water storage prior to storm and peak fig 9b soil water storage is defined here as the basin averaged percentage of soil water content s out of the maximal soil storage s0 no significant difference p value 0 6 in pre storm soil water storage between moderate and large extreme events was observed on the other hand large differences were observed in the peak soil water storage with a significantly p value 0 01 lower peak soil water storage for the moderate group the substantial increase 170 in soil water storage from storm beginning to flood peak generation can be appreciated from fig 9b pre storm values of extreme magnitude events are similar to the other cases while their peak values are the largest 5 3 basin rainfall coverage fig 9c the basin areal fraction of peak rain peak wet area ratio and peak rca extent were statistically significantly different p value 0 001 in both cases between the two groups and to increase with magnitude moderate events were characterized by a wide range of peak rain coverage values whereas large extreme events were found to occur only with high values 70 the ratio between the areal coverage of peak rain and peak rca extent can indicate how effectively the rainfall is for moderate events 50 of the average peak rain was converted to peak rca indicating a lower effectiveness compared to large extreme events where the conversion was more than 80 in addition the events of extreme magnitude were characterized by high 100 peak rca extent i e the whole basin contributed runoff to the peak discharge 5 4 peak rca rain intensity fig 9d and the percentage of convective rain over peak rca extent fig 9e the effect shown above can be explained by further analyzing the rainfall falling on the peak rca extent both the average rain intensities on the peak rca extent fig 9d and its convective portion fig 9e were found to significantly p value 0 01 and 0 03 respectively increase with magnitude convective rain is defined as a 5 min rain intensity of at least 10 mm h 1 based on previous studies in the area peleg and morin 2012 5 5 the contribution of land use to outlet peak discharge fig 9f this is defined as the percentage of peak water volume contributed from each land use type out of the total water volume in the basin outlet during a time window of 50 min centered on the time of peak discharge cultivated fields uncultivated fields and rural residential areas are the most important contributors to the peak discharge this is not surprising as they cover 65 of the basins and are characterized by moderate cn values differences between the moderate and large extreme group were found to be significant in all cases p value 0 01 except for the cultivated fields p value 0 08 in general despite the areal coverage of the land use the relative contribution from land uses with low runoff potential groves and forests plantations and uncultivated fields was found to increase with event magnitude for example forests and plantations cover 35 of the basins but make a negligible contribution 10 in moderate events uncultivated fields cover 37 of the basins but contribute less than 10 in more than half of the moderate events on the other hand in the large extreme magnitude group their co contribution exceeds 50 of the peak discharge outflow volume during more than half of the events this general trend is even more enhanced in extreme events where in particular the contribution of forests becomes substantial 6 summary and discussion the present study investigates the relationships among basins rainfall properties and flash flood peak discharge while accounting for rcas using a new distributed hydrological model gb hydra in analyzing the contributions to peak discharge two main behaviors were identified rainfall intensity dominated and rca extent dominated in particular rainfall dominated behavior will occur when a large portion of the basin close to 100 contributes which is typical of extreme events in these cases the method presented in this paper concurs with the reasoning behind the rational formula chow et al 1988 however when the events are less intense and only part of the basin contributes runoff a new approach is needed following this insight we presented a new index irca that captures the relations among rain intensity rcas and peak discharge for a wide range of storms the observed peak discharge was found to be linearly related 64 of explained variance to this index 6 1 what affects flood magnitude initial soil water storage is often considered to be an important factor for runoff generation particularly in extreme events blöschl et al 2013 borga et al 2007 lana renault et al 2011 merheb et al 2016 merz and blöschl 2009 in this study pre storm soil water storage was found to be of minor importance fig 9b this is in agreement with studies suggesting that when rain intensities are high or when the soil is shallow and less permeable the role of initial soil moisture decreases castillo et al 2003 fitzjohn et al 1998 grillakis et al 2016 wood et al 1990 these principles were met in the research area which is characterized by intense convective rain cells peleg and morin 2012 and shallow soils rich in clay and silt singer 2007 in addition storm events in the region are not consecutive and long several days to 1 month dry spells goldreich 2003 allow for soil water storage to decrease and return to its typical inter storm values 50 10 however during the storm especially in events characterized by high rain depth soil moisture increases and reaches high values just before peak discharge 80 in moderate magnitude and 90 in large and extreme floods on average fig 9b there is a known connection between total rain depth and event magnitude or peak discharge blöschl et al 2013 merheb et al 2016 this finding was supported by this research as the rain depth in large extreme magnitude events was more than double that in moderate ones fig 9a however storm rain depth is not the only important rain property as various studies in mediterranean and arid environments claim that short duration maximal rain intensities also play a crucial role in flash flood occurrence belachsen et al 2017 bracken et al 2008 schick 1988 in this study we found that rain intensities differ between the two magnitude groups and increase from 3 to 14 mm h 1 on average fig 9d convective rain is not a prerequisite for large peak rca extent as it usually covers only a small portion of this area however greater convective rain coverage is associated with greater flood magnitude fig 9e the relative contribution of peak rca extent to peak discharge was also found to be associated with land use type fig 9e in general the dominant land uses in the research site seem to be the rural residential area and the cultivated and uncultivated fields contribution from groves and forests plantations and uncultivated fields mainly occurs during events of large and extreme magnitudes thus reinforcing previous results liu et al 2006 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 extreme events occur under rare hydrometeorological conditions in which intense rain storms interact with basin characteristics such that the generated flow magnitude is maximized these events are of special hydrological and applicative interest as during these events some of the hydrological properties that normally have a minor effect are revealed archer et al 2007 borga et al 2008 marchi et al 2010 in this study a single storm generated an extreme hydrological response in three of the four basins studied in these events the pre storm soil water storage was similar to the other cases 48 but increased substantially during the event and reached high pre peak values 94 due to high total rain depth 160 mm these extreme events were also accompanied by high areal rain coverage 92 and intense rain basin average 16 mm h 1 local maximal average 185 mm h 1 and 16 coverage of convective rainfall over peak rca extent in addition during the analyzed extreme events 100 of the basin contributed prior to peak occurrence and basin areas characterized by land use types with low runoff potential and normally low contribution to peak discharge became much more dominant for example 20 of the runoff came from grove and forested areas compared to 10 in large events 6 2 peak time window irca and peak rca extent calculations require the definition of a time window representing a characteristic response time intuitively this quantity should be related to the time of concentration as it accounts for the duration of water to travel from the basin s furthest point to the outlet chow et al 1988 however findings in this study suggest that the time window of interest should also be related to the typical rainfall properties in the study region the time of concentration is related to continuous and uniform rainfall occurrence chow et al 1988 viessman and lewis 2002 however when the duration of high rain intensities is shorter than the time of concentration the basin s theoretical maximal peak discharge is not achieved in this case the resultant peak discharge is lower than maximal the actual basin response time is shorter and the rain duration becomes the dominant factor eagleson 1970 this might be the case in the research area as the flash flood producing rain cells belachsen et al 2017 doswell et al 1996 smith et al 2000 yakir and morin 2011 have a much shorter residence time peleg and morin 2012 than the time of concentration it is thus suggested that in the case of the studied events the hydrological response time at peak occurrence may not be controlled by the basin properties but by those of the rain 6 3 linearity of basin response hydrological processes are nonlinear in nature due to threshold behaviors and nonlinearities in routing processes antecedent moisture conditions channel transmission losses interaction between the surface and subsurface and the different time scales associated with each process beven 2001 goodrich et al 1997 vivoni et al 2007 in particular rogger et al 2012 ali and roy 2010 and dickinson and whiteley 1970 found nonlinear behavior of discharge with increasing rca despite this inherent nonlinear behavior linear models such as the unit hydrograph unit transfer functions and rational formula have been successfully applied for simplified hydrological calculations brutsaert 2005 chow et al 1988 this is because a close to linear relationship does exist between the effective rainfall and the resulting discharge beven 2001 iacobellis and fiorentino 2000 the focus of this research was on the peak discharge and its occurrence at the climax of the hydrological response during this time rain over the peak rca extent turns into runoff infiltration losses are minor and the system moves toward the linear relationship found between peak discharge and effective rainfall over the rca extent represented by the irca index the similarity of this relationship s characteristics among all examined basins is probably due to their similar lithological soil and morphological properties as well as the similar rain storm properties goldreich 2003 peleg and morin 2012 singer 2007 sneh et al 1998 7 conclusions a grid based distributed hydrological runoff model gb hydra and a novel index irca were developed and used in four mediterranean rural medium size basins this application helped identify and study the dominant factors controlling peak discharge the main conclusions of this study are using parameter values from the literature gb hydra well predicts r2 0 77 flash flood peak discharge for a range of basin sizes 18 69 km2 and event magnitudes rca validation especially at a 5 minute time scale is a challenging task identification of flow no flow areas from pictures taken in a field survey during flood events and estimated peak discharge at internal basin locations using post event analysis provide direct and indirect support of the modeled rca the new proposed irca index defined as the multiplication of peak rca extent by rain intensity over the same area during a characteristic time window is linearly correlated with measured peak discharge r2 0 64 furthermore this linear relationship seems to hold across a wide range of event magnitudes and the four basins a characteristic time of 50 min optimized the above correlation for the studied cases this time scale is shorter than the basins time of concentration probably due to the typically shorter durations of runoff producing rainfall in the region soil water storage prior to a storm is not significantly different between moderate and large extreme flood magnitudes however it increases during the storm and this difference becomes significant when considered prior to the flood peak total storm rain depths rainfall coverage area rca extent and fraction of convective rainfall over the rca increase significantly with event magnitude the storm of february 1995 resulted in extreme flash flood responses in three of the four studied basins it was characterized by convective rain and a total basin averaged rain depth exceeding 160 mm which resulted in high 94 pre peak soil water storage values and close to 100 peak rca extent in these cases runoff contribution from land uses with low runoff potential was dominant irca and peak rca indexes were found to be powerful tools and will be utilized in our future studies further research is required to better understand the nature of the peak

7047,karst aquifers are known for their complex flow mechanisms produced by the high spatial heterogeneity of void distribution this study aims at confirming and enhancing the understanding of these flow mechanisms in a fissured karst aquifer using flow simulation with a double medium approach groundwater level gwl variations of the studied site a 17 km2 topographic hill located in burgundy france are monitored hourly through 18 boreholes 3 karstic resurgences and the outlet river discharge of the catchment basin 40 km2 the gerke and van genuchten double porosity model is implemented in the metis code and used to simulate gwl variations with a matrix and a fracture medium model parameters are calibrated by fitting a simulated fracture medium gwl to measured gwl for four boreholes that are representative of the topographic hill hydrodynamics the double medium approach succeeds in reproducing measured fast gwl responses after recharge events that are not reproduced by a single medium approach investigating the model parameters impact on simulated gwl variations and the exchange flow between the two media allows the conceptualization of the physical structure and the hydrodynamic mechanisms of the fissured karst aquifer the spatial organization of parameters is observed and indicates areas of higher fracture density producing rapid gwl responses in contrast to lower fracture density areas which produce slower and higher gwl responses the fracture medium hydraulic parameters and the exchange parameter controlling the matrix fracture interface properties are the most influential parameters for the simulated fracture medium gwl and the exchange flow between the matrix and the fracture medium during a recharge event calibrated fracture medium hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity vary respectively from 6 3e to 05 m s 1 and 0 3 to 3 2e 04 m s 1 and 2 4 and the exchange parameter varies from 2 9e 10 m 1 s 1 to 6 5e 10 m 1 s 1 matrix medium hydraulic conductivity variations have little impact on the simulation results while matrix medium effective porosity affects slightly simulated gwl values vary from 11 to 17 finally this study shows the gerke and van genuchten double porous medium validity for the simulation of groundwater level in a fissured karst aquifer keywords hydrogeology modelling karst aquifers double medium approach groundwater level simulations 1 introduction karst aquifers are characterized by a highly heterogeneous distribution of voids created by groundwater flow bakalowicz 2005 these voids allow flow velocities up to several tens m h and the spatial heterogeneity makes physical property and process investigations in karst aquifers difficult since high spatial density underground information is seldom available the physical properties of karst aquifers are usually investigated by the analysis of output data spring hydrographs and chemographs following numerous approaches hydrograph analysis dewandel et al 2003 kovács et al 2005 kovács and perrochet 2008 isotope and major chemical chemograph analysis aquilina et al 2005 delbart et al 2014a ladouche et al 2001 signal processing analysis bailly compte et al 2011 delbart et al 2014b delbart et al 2016 massei et al 2006 and physically based modelling cornaton and perrochet 2007 fleury et al 2007 kiraly 1998 kordilla et al 2012 tritz et al 2011 physically based models are used for groundwater management and pollution infiltration prediction considering karst flow mechanisms therrien and sudicky 1996 these modelling approaches can be subdivided in two groups 1 distributed models that discretize karst systems in two or three dimensional grids and require the assignment of hydraulic parameters and 2 lumped models that conceptualize physical processes at the scale of the whole karst system without explicitly modelling spatial variability fleury et al 2007 fleury et al 2008 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 hartmann et al 2014 lumped models are usually employed when system hydraulic properties are poorly known to simulate karst spring discharge by converting input recharge into output discharge with linear chen et al 2014 fleury et al 2007 fleury et al 2008 or non linear tritz et al 2011 equations distributed karst models can only be applied to well explored sites since they require spatial information on karst system properties in distributed approaches karst hydrological specifics are modelled by 1 a double medium approach that considers two interacting media matrix and fracture conduit with a linear water exchange term depending on their state or 2 a combined discrete continuum approach where fracture conduit networks are modelled as discrete elements embedded in a matrix continuum hartmann et al 2014 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 the double medium approach is used when no conduit networks have been identified in the field kordilla et al 2012 teutsch 1993 or when fracture density is assumed homogeneous on the test site whereas the discrete continuum approach is much used in well developed karst aquifers where conduit geometry is known cornaton and perrochet 2007 hartmann et al 2014 kiraly 1998 therrien and sudicky 1996 double porosity models were first developed for oil reservoir simulation and well test interpretations warren and root 1963 by modelling a porous matrix medium traversed by a fracture network both systems are linked by exchange flow expressed by darcy s law with a shape factor related to the geometry of the matrix blocks in the field of hydrogeology gerke and van genuchten 1993a b proposed a model inspired by the warren and root model for water flow in saturated or unsaturated media in which budget equations are expressed in each medium by the richard s equation formula this double medium model is used in this paper to simulate groundwater level variations without considering the vadose zone and epikarst the studied site located in burgundy france is characterized by a high density of monitoring boreholes that is 18 boreholes in a 17 km2 topographic hill this site has been spatially and temporally investigated through hydrogeological and geochemical studies with natural tracers and cross correlation analysis delbart 2013 delbart et al 2014a delbart et al 2014b delbart et al 2016 this karst aquifer is not well developed since no large conduit networks are known however fracture families have been identified by borehole and outcrop investigations delbart 2013 and previous signal processing analyses of spring hydrographs and borehole groundwater level variations delbart et al 2014b delbart et al 2016 this identification leads one to consider this aquifer as a homogeneous fissured karst aquifer this work aims at confirming and enhancing the understanding of groundwater flow mechanisms in this fissured karst aquifer using flow simulation with a double medium approach working on a spatially well explored test site allows us to calibrate model hydraulic parameters by fitting simulated groundwater level gwl with borehole groundwater level variations similar to the karst spring dynamics delbart 2013 delbart et al 2014a the first part introduces the gerke and van genuchten double medium model implementation in the metis code developed by the geosciences department of mines paristech goblet 2017 and considers each system as an equivalent porous medium the model parameter optimization method using latin hypercube sampling and root mean square error as objective functions is also introduced then a general context with the available hydrodynamic measurements of the studied site the flow model specifics and recharge computations for single and double medium approaches are presented single medium flow simulation results are first exposed to show their limits for reproducing groundwater level variations then double medium flow simulation results are presented for short and long periods to assess the impact of the period length on calibrated hydraulic parameters a focus on the exchange flow between media is presented that allows one to understand the hydrodynamic model functioning during a recharge event model parameter sensitivity analysis is finally shown to assess the parameters impact on simulated gwl and water transferred between media 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model warren and root 1963 first developed double porosity models for oil reservoir simulation and well test interpretation by modelling a porous matrix medium primary medium traversed by a fracture network secondary medium the authors have proposed a simplified conceptual model made of parallelepiped blocks separated by three sets of orthogonal planar fractures fig 1 flow exchange is controlled by the pressure difference between the two media and expressed by darcy s law with a shape factor related to the shape and size of the blocks the determination of this shape factor and even its theoretical validity are the subject of an important debate see for example bourbiaux et al 1999 or hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2006 in the field of hydrogeology gerke and van genuchten 1993a have proposed a model inspired by the warren and root model for the flow of water in saturated or unsaturated media this model is implemented in the hydrus programme the gerke and van genuchten model is based on the assumption that richard s equation for transient water flow can be applied to both pore systems this assumption leads to the following set of equations in which the budget equations are expressed in each medium for a one dimensional vertical system equation in a representative elementary volume rev inside a fracture 1 c f h f t z k f h f z k f γ w w f s f equation in a matrix rev 2 c m h m t z k m h m z k m γ w 1 w f s m where kf and km l t 1 represent the fracture and matrix pore system hydraulic conductivities hf and hm l represent the fracture and matrix pore system pressure heads γw is the exchange term t 1 describing the transfer of water between the two pore systems sm and sf t 1 are source sink terms to account for root water extraction wf is the volume fraction of the fracture system in the global medium and cm and cf l 1 are the specific soil water capacities expressed by 3 c s w s s ε s w h where sw is the degree of fluid saturation ss l 1 the specific storage coefficient for fracture or

w α w h f h m α w α w k a α w β a 2 γ w where ka is the transition hydraulic conductivity between the media β is the shape factor depending on the fracture geometry 3 for a set of equally spaced orthogonal fractures γw is an empirical factor and a is equal to half the average distance between fractures in the case of equally spaced main fracture sets β 3 2 2 implementation in the metis code the metis code is being developed by the geosciences department of mines paristech goblet 2017 it solves by the finite element method the equations of flow mass and heat transfer in a three dimensional variably saturated medium it has been used in numerous applications related for instance to the modelling of natural tracers or the estimation of hydrogeological model parameters castro and goblet 2003 patriarche et al 2004 renard et al 2016 one of the characteristics of the metis code is the possibility to include reduced dimensionality elements 1d or 2d elements in a 3d mesh for instance to represent large scale fractures and boreholes joint elements this feature has been used as will be shown later to implement the double porosity model the metis code uses an equivalent continuous medium approach to represent a porous medium as well as a fractured medium to represent a double porosity system two overlapping media are considered in an rev each one occupying all the rev volume this implies that the properties of each medium hydraulic conductivity and porosity must be weighted by its volume fraction to yield an equivalent property i e wf for the fractured medium and 1 wf for the matrix medium the metis code solves the equations of flow with a linear finite element technique according to a standard galerkin formulation the double medium approach is implemented as follows each medium is discretized on a separate mesh over which the conservation equation of the appropriate medium is formulated eqs 5 and 6 for the porous medium 5 d i n i div k m grad h m c m h m t γ w 0 for the fractured medium 6 d i n i k f g r a d h f c f h f t γ w 0 the overlapping meshes communicate through one dimensional elements joint elements in which the connection equation see eq 4 is discretized as a steady state conservation equation that yields the desired flow head relationship the generation of overlapping meshes as well as the connection elements is transparent for the user the resulting discretization is solved on the composite mesh resulting from the assemblage of the overlapping meshes and the connection elements this very flexible setup which is facilitated by the general finite element framework allows representing in any space dimension 1 2 or 3d an arbitrary number of simultaneous media although the double medium has been to date the only one considered in practical applications it allows also including without further development all the options of the single medium simulator i e variable saturation flow mass and heat transfer 2 3 optimization method an optimization procedure has been developed to calibrate hydraulic parameters based on the adjustment between simulated groundwater level gwl and borehole measurements using the latin hypercube sampling lhs method mckay et al 2000 each computation is initiated with a different set of parameters a statistical law is assigned to each parameter normal log normal etc and values are randomly picked following these distributions laws the lhs method ensures that parameter ranges are equally sampled and fully explored flow simulations are computed with these different combinations of parameters simulated and measured gwl variations are compared by root mean square error rmse computations 8 rmse n 1 gwl s gwl m 2 n gwls and gwlm are the simulated and measured groundwater levels respectively rmse is a classical tool used to quantify the accuracy of model results with reality measurements including in hydrology and hydrogeology modelling cousquer 2017 delottier 2017 kordilla et al 2012 moussu et al 2011 each simulation is rated by a rmse value quantifying the accuracy of the fit between model results and field measurements for every borehole thus each borehole has an optimal set of parameters corresponding to the weakest rmse value and reproducing at the best measured gwl this procedure has been chosen rather than an iterative optimization method since calculations are run on a supercomputer that allows testing a huge number of parameter combinations several thousand at the same time this method guaranties a full exploration of the parameter range values avoiding local optima 3 studied site 3 1 localization and general context the studied system is a 17 km2 topographic dome located in eastern france the altitude varies from 356 m to 526 m fig 3a the studied system is part of the main river catchment which has an approximate area of 40 km2 fig 2 the river discharge has been monitored hourly at the catchment outlet since 2009 forest land covers 82 5 of the total topographic hill surface whereas urban and agricultural land represents 17 5 of the total surface annual rainfall of the studied area varies from 732 mm y to 1106 mm y with an average of 901 mm y 2010 2015 météo france data this topographic hill has been investigated through several studies for geological survey hydrogeological and geochemical understanding with field and modelling approaches delbart 2013 delbart et al 2014a delbart et al 2014b delbart et al 2016 the regional stratigraphy is represented by tabular jurassic limestone intersected by marl fig 2 at the catchment scale two aquifers are supported by two impermeable layers this work focuses on the upper bathonian limestone aquifer that drains the studied topographic hill the vadose zone thickness reaches a maximum of 70 m with an average of 45 m at the topographic hill centre the saturated zone reaches a thickness of 15 m at the topographic hill centre the vadose zone and the saturated zone are limited by the southern part of the topographic hill where the bajocian ostra marl appears on the surface fig 2 this superior part of the aquifer is composed of bathonian limestone which is characterized by three types of porosity matrix porosity reflects the rock internal structure fracture porosity is linked to the regional tectonic history and conduit porosity is created by calcite dissolution matrix effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity have been determined by mercury intrusion methods autopore micrométrics 9500 and using a non steady state air permeameter ifp 49 apparatus on rock samples from boreholes bh n 3 4 9 14 and 16 see fig 2 in the saturated zone composed of bathonian oncolite limestone the average matrix effective porosity is 2 6 with a minimum and a maximum of 2 3 and 3 1 for 42 samples and the average matrix hydraulic conductivity is 1 1e 8 m s with a minimum and a maximum matrix hydraulic conductivity of 1 93e 9 and 1 93e 8 for 77 samples fracture porosity has been evaluated by outcrop observations the fracture aperture varies from millimetres up to 20 cm with an average of 3 cm for 654 measured fractures the average distance between two fractures is approximately 2 m for investigated outcrops some karstic voids are observed in the field their sizes can reach a few metres but no large conduit networks are known in the studied system groundwater flows from north northeast to the south and discharges among several karstic resurgences disposed all around the topographic hill fig 3 b the gwl of borehole n 17 located at the topographic hill centre fig 3a is not taken into account for generating the reference piezometric map since this gwl is 35 m higher than the nearby average fig 4 this particular behaviour is still not explained the upper aquifer is also leaking towards the inferior aquifer through faults located in the centre lower part of the studied area fig 5 a 3 2 available data the studied site is particularly well explored with 18 boreholes three karstic resurgences sr n 2 4 and 6 in fig 4 and the river catchment outlet monitored hourly with groundwater level or discharge measurements fig 4 these observation points provide information about the hydrodynamic behaviour at different scales borehole measurements give local information of the gwl fluctuations whereas karstic resurgences integrate the hydrodynamic functioning of the whole topographic hill finally river discharge monitoring provides information about the catchment basin hydrodynamics as shown in fig 4 the gwl dynamic is spatially variable most of the boreholes react rapidly after recharge events demonstrating the necessity of hourly time step monitoring but with different gwl peak heights and recession curves the fast responses of the measured groundwater level springs and river discharge suggest that the studied site hydrodynamics are more related to fracture porosity than matrix porosity where smoother and slower responses should be measured after recharge events boreholes springs and river discharge fig 4 show seasonal variations with low gwl or discharge during summer periods low flow periods some boreholes display gwl drops or thresholds especially during these low flow periods bh n 6 14 and 17 explained by the emptying of fracture networks some boreholes as bh n 2 display small peak heights after recharge events which is typical of boreholes located in a less conductive rock borehole measurements of n 5 and 16 have similar gwl variations due to their proximity in the field 45 m despite these various behaviours the gwl dynamics of boreholes n 8 16 and 17 fig 4 are close to karstic resurgences sr n 6 see fig 4 and the catchment outlet river discharge dynamics this outcome indicates that these boreholes are representative of the topographic hill hydrodynamics as mentioned above gwl measurements for borehole n 17 are higher than gwl measured nearby indicating a particular behaviour that is still not explained however the borehole n 17 gwl dynamics are similar to the topographic hill hydrodynamics fast responses after recharge events fig 4 thus a 35 m vertical offset is applied to simulated gwl for calibrating model parameters which allows reproduction of the measured borehole n 17 gwl hydrodynamics following this assumption four boreholes bh n 5 8 16 and 17 showing the same hydrodynamics are retained for model parameter calibration between the simulated fracture medium and measured groundwater level 3 3 flow model description an unconfined saturated horizontal two dimensional model is used to represent the topographic hill groundwater 17 km2 this domain is discretized by a voronoi type mesh with 15 093 triangular elements of an average area of 1000 m2 fig 5b the substratum surface of the model is interpolated from the marl depth measured in 30 drillings and marl outcrops taking into account geologic discontinuities fig 5a the marl surface is subdivided in planes by strike slip faults interpolations of the marl depths are then carried out for each plane from measured points and the layer mean inclination data smoothing is finally applied to the previous marl surfaces because transitions between two compartments separated by a discontinuity are too abrupt for the hydrogeologic code a fixed hydraulic head boundary condition is applied to the topographic hill limits corresponding to the groundwater emergence fig 5b to the north a no flow boundary condition is set corresponding to the piezometric crest in the central low part of the studied site borehole n 18 see fig 5a faults have brought into contact the two superposed aquifers because of the concentric piezometric isolines fig 5b a vertical leakage is assumed from the superior to the inferior aquifer fig 5b this leakage flow is estimated at 160 mm y by a simple darcy calculation on a 0 13 km2 vertical surface and applied according to the flow model type single or double medium model 3 4 recharge computation the estimation of recharge and the recharge repartition between media are essential for single medium and double medium modelling recharge is computed from an hourly thornthwaite and matter water budget dourado neto et al 2010 taking into account evapotranspiration penman and monteith equation from allen et al 1998 soil water storage capacity fixed to 10 mm to better reproduce groundwater level peaks among the studied site boreholes and runoff the runoff coefficient is estimated from the schaake et al 1967 equation considering the ratio between impermeable and non impermeable surfaces and the topographic mean slope of the studied site which gives a runoff coefficient of 3 7 a mean annual recharge rate of 560 mm y is obtained for the 2010 2015 period to confirm this recharge computation the water budget is calculated at the outlet catchment using the hourly monitored river discharge annual accumulated river flow divided by the river catchment area 40 km2 gives an average recharge rate of 591 mm y for the 2010 2015 period these two recharge rate calculations are consistent since mean annual runoff considered in the thornthwaite and matter water budget is 33 mm y for the 2010 2015 period total recharge cannot be applied directly by an equivalent porous medium for reproducing at the same time borehole gwl baselines peak heights and recession moreover the double medium model requires a recharge repartition for both media thus single medium and double medium model recharge repartitions are related to the catchment basin water budget considering the outlet river discharge as the total outflow of the catchment basin during low flow periods summer periods see fig 4 it is supposed that fracture porosity does not provide water to the matrix porous system thus the mean river discharge baseline 230 l s 1 for the 2010 2015 period fig 4 reflects flow moving through the matrix porosity at the catchment scale related to the catchment basin area it corresponds to a 197 mm y matrix recharge rate following the catchment basin water budget recharge is split into two parts with 1 a steady flow to reproduce the groundwater level baseline to which 2 a percentage of the hourly transient recharge is added to reproduce fast groundwater level responses after recharge events for the single medium approach the 197 mm y matrix recharge is applied as a steady flow and the remaining 363 mm y are hourly transient recharge as a percentage of the recharge time series in the same equivalent porous medium for the double medium approach the 197 mm y matrix recharge is treated as a steady flow to the matrix medium the remaining 363 mm y are hourly transient recharge as a percentage of the recharge time series to the fracture medium 3 5 model parametrization the single medium approach is first performed to test the ability of an equivalent porous medium to reproduce groundwater level variations of the studied fissured karst aquifer flow model geometry and boundary conditions are the same as presented above the single and double medium model hydraulic parameter assignments table 1 are presented for the two approaches 3 5 1 single medium model specifics hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity for the equivalent porous medium are set homogeneously on the whole mesh combinations of these two parameters are generated by the lhs method which ensures that all values of the parameter ranges table 1 are well sampled following statistical laws simulated and measured gwl are then compared by rmse calculations giving the optimal combination of parameters for each borehole among a thousand tested combinations 3 5 2 double medium model specifics the exchange parameter αw is described by an exchange hydraulic conductivity ka and a geometry interface parameter between media αw see eq 4 as mentioned earlier determination of the shape factor β and the transition hydraulic conductivity between media ka is highly discussed in the double porous system modelling literature gerke and van genuchten 1993b have proposed that shape factor could be essentially considered an empirical quantity that must be calibrated to observed field data the interface hydraulic conductivity between the matrix and fracture media is poorly investigated for karst systems few studies gerke and van genuchten 1993a gerke and van genuchten 1993b moench 1984 thoma 1992 have shown that exchange hydraulic conductivity could be much less than the matrix hydraulic conductivity more recently kordilla et al 2012 investigated double continuum saturated and unsaturated flow simulations using the gerke and van genuchten exchange parameter these authors set the interface hydraulic conductivity value identical to the matrix hydraulic conductivity and the geometry interface parameter to a high value such that it does not act as an additional barrier for water transfer between both media in this paper the exchange parameter αw is adjusted as a whole by modifying the space between fractures a the interface hydraulic conductivity has been fixed as the mean matrix hydraulic conductivity and the shape factor β is set to represent parallelepiped matrix blocks separated by fractures thus the total exchange parameter calibration is related to the space between fractures calibration hydraulic conductivity effective porosity and the exchange parameter for each medium are set homogeneously on the whole mesh parameter combinations are generated by the lhs method and the optimal set of parameters is obtained using rmse as the objective function between the simulated fracture medium and measured gwl for each borehole among a thousand tested parameter combinations matrix hydraulic parameter values are constrained by field values table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 single medium approach the model parameter optimization procedure previously introduced is first performed for single medium flow simulations to test the ability of an equivalent porous medium to reproduce the measured gwl in boreholes strongly influenced by fractures as shown infig 6 a using the recharge repartition estimated from the catchment basin water budget does not allow reproduction of measured gwl variations the recession curves are too long this recharge repartition is not adapted for one equivalent porous medium with the hydraulic parameter tested values table 1 the recharge transient part should be reduced to decrease the gwl peak heights and shorten recession curves further calculations have been performed using the lhs method to adjust the recharge transient part of the model a 56 mm y transient recharge gives the best adjustment fig 6b using hydraulic parameter values coherent with field values table 1 between simulated and measured gwl for borehole n 16 however this recharge parametrization means that only 10 of the total recharge 560 mm y is hourly transient recharge to the equivalent medium which is much less than the 65 estimated from the catchment basin water budget despite this recharge calibration the simulated recession curves are still longer and peak heights are smaller than the measured recession curves fig 6b justifying the necessity of a second porous medium to reproduce the rapid gwl variations after recharge events 4 2 double medium approach the model parameter optimization procedure is performed for flow simulations with the double medium approach matrix and fractured medium hydraulic parameters just like the exchange parameter are adjusted to reproduce the rapid gwl recession curves after recharge events as mentioned above the simulated fracture medium and measured gwl level are compared through the objective function rmse since the studied site hydrodynamics are related to fracture porosity two simulation periods are observed 1 a one year short period with a two year model initialisation period to assess the ability of the double medium model to reproduce gwl peak heights and recession curves and 2 a three year long period with a three year initialisation period to evaluate the ability of the double medium model to reproduce gwl seasonal variations parameter sets are compared between the two simulation periods table 2 finally the simulated matrix and fracture medium gwl variations are presented in parallel with the exchange flow between both media during a major recharge event fig 9 this analysis is shown for borehole n 16 and allows one to understand the model hydrodynamic functioning during a recharge event calibrated matrix medium effective porosities which vary from 11 to 17 table 2 are higher than field effective porosity measurements which vary from 2 to 7 table 1 suggesting that selected non fissured rock samples for mercury intrusions were not representative of the global matrix effective porosity of the studied site but rather of non porous matrix rock samples these higher calibrated matrix effective porosity values can also indicate an excessive recharge steady flow in the matrix medium not adapted to field measured matrix effective porosities recharge repartition optimization between both media could be envisaged in further calculations to verify the actual recharge repartition cf 3 4 for the same simulation period borehole rmse values table 2 cannot be compared with each other because the boreholes have different groundwater level dynamics and peak heights especially bh n 17 because of the gwl thresholds during summer periods fig 4 4 2 1 short term simulation analysis the presented results correspond to the best adjustment weakest rmse value among a thousand tested parameter combinations for each borehole obtained from the model parameter optimization procedure for one year following a two year initialisation period simulated fracture medium gwl variations show a good fit with the measured gwl of the boreholes of interest n 5 8 16 and 17 as shown in fig 7 rapid gwl recession curves not reproduced by the single medium model fig 6 and gwl peak heights are reproduced by the double medium model during may 2015 a major rainfall event 77 mm in 69 h was recorded on the studied site with a gwl response time after recharge less than 20 h this event is also well reproduced by the model in terms of height and recession curves other boreholes of the studied site are not investigated since they show specific gwl variations thresholds small peaks reactions to only few recharge events see fig 4 that are not reproduced by this double medium model an offset is applied to borehole n 17 simulated fracture medium gwl for fixing the difference with measured gwl 35 m this allows for calibrating a parameter combination to reproduce the particular hydrodynamic behaviour of borehole n 17 the rmse is then computed between the adjusted simulated fracture medium and measured gwls calibrated parameter values table 2 suggest a spatial organization for the four boreholes boreholes n 5 8 16 are located in the southern part of the topographic hill and borehole n 17 is located at the topographic hill centre fig 2 these two sets of boreholes are distinguished by the fracture medium effective porosity and exchange parameter values since the exchange parameter is related to the distance between fractures these two different parameter combinations give local information about the physical properties and the structure of the fissured karst aquifer boreholes located in the topographic hill southern part bh n 5 8 and 16 display a mean fracture medium effective porosity of 0 014 and a mean exchange parameter of 4 3e 09 m 1 s 1 corresponding to a mean matrix block size of 24 m producing small simulated fracture medium gwl peaks and short recession curves fig 7 borehole n 17 located in the topographic hill centre displays a fracture medium effective porosity of 0 004 and an exchange parameter of 3 8e 10 m 1 s 1 corresponding to a matrix block size of 80 m the fracture medium nearby borehole n 17 has a lower effective porosity than the fracture medium in the southern part of the topographic hill combining a low exchange parameter value and a less porous fracture medium allows reproduction of higher gwl fluctuation and longer recession curves fig 7 this local distribution of the fracture medium hydraulic parameters and the exchange parameter is a consequence of the spatial heterogeneity of gwl variations related to the fracture spatial distribution of the studied site 4 2 2 long term simulation analysis a long simulation period is investigated to evaluate the ability of the double medium model to reproduce seasonal and annual gwl variations as well as the impact of the data s length on the calibrated hydraulic parameter values the presented results correspond to the best adjustment among a thousand tested parameter combinations for borehole n 16 weakest rmse value obtained from the model parameter optimization procedure for a six year simulation period 2010 2015 including a three year stabilization period 2010 2012 as shown in the fig 8 the simulated fracture medium gwl variations of borehole n 16 are reproduced for a longer simulation period simulated fracture medium gwl is lower than measured gwl for the 2013 january may period because of the mean annual recharge contrast between previous years 585 mm for 2012 and the beginning of the presented period 759 mm for 2013 the simulated fracture medium gwl is directly linked to recharge since no vadose zone is accounted for in this model the studied site mean vadose zone is approximately 50 m thus considering this unsaturated zone could lead to gwl baseline stabilization over more or less wet periods extending the simulation period logically produces a deterioration of the adjustment quality higher rmse values table 2 between the simulated fracture medium and measured gwl optimal model parameter values are similar for each borehole between the two simulation periods table 2 except for matrix medium hydraulic conductivity which does not impact the simulated fracture medium gwl as shown later fig 10 4 2 3 model hydrodynamic functioning investigating the hydrodynamic model functioning during a recharge event allows one to understand the flow mechanisms taking place between the matrix and fracture systems in the fissured karst aquifer simulated matrix and fracture medium gwl variations are presented in parallel with the exchange flow between both media during a major recharge event fig 9 for zero recharge periods the matrix gwl is a few decimetres above the fracture gwl fig 9a thus exchange flow is oriented from the matrix towards the fracture medium see eq 4 during recharge events the fracture medium gwl peaks pass over the matrix medium gwl indicating an inversion of the exchange flow between both media the matrix medium provides water to the fracture medium in such a way that gwl baseline is maintained in the fracture medium for zero recharge periods during recharge events the impulse signal is either evacuated through the fractured medium to the model boundaries or temporarily stored in the matrix medium or probably both the balance between these two processes is strongly linked to the model parameters as presented later the exchange flow oriented from the fracture medium towards the matrix medium corresponding to the red area below the exchange flow curve fig 9b is compared to the recharge amount for the same event thus during the recharge event of 2015 may considering the optimal model parameter combination for borehole n 16 39 of the recharge event is stored in the matrix medium fig 9b and the remaining 61 is evacuated through the fracture medium to the model boundaries therefore as expected the model hydrodynamics are controlled by the pressure gradient between both media the emptying of the fracture medium during zero recharge periods is balanced by an exchange flow oriented from the matrix to the fractured medium which corresponds in the field to a draining of the matrix porosity the increase of the fractured medium gwl during recharge events induces an exchange flux from the fracture to the matrix medium which corresponds in the field to a recharge of the matrix porosity the amount of recharge water stored in the matrix medium and the matrix recharge draining processes will become more important in the case of a double medium transport model where simulated tracer restitution curves are calibrated to measured curves in the field indeed a more or less important recharge rate stored in the matrix medium depending on the model parameters as presented later could delay the tracer restitution in the model 4 3 sensitivity analysis adjustment quality between simulated and measured gwl depends on the combination of model parameters nevertheless assessing a parameter s individual impact on simulated gwl and the exchange flow gives information about the influence and role of each parameter in the double medium model parametrization a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to highlight the impact of each parameter on the simulated fracture medium groundwater level variations for the two simulation periods and on the water transfer between both media during a recharge event for borehole n 16 four parameters have been fixed to their optimal values table 2 and one modified in accordance with previously presented parameter ranges table 1 rmse is used as the objective function for comparing the adjustment accuracy between the simulated fracture medium and measured gwl individual parameter values are plotted versus rmse values fig 10 and each parameter s individual impact on the simulated fracture medium gwl variations are presented fig 11 the impact of each parameter on the water transfer between the two media is also presented by computing the recharge rate from the fracture medium into the matrix medium during the 2015 may recharge event table 3 as previously introduced fig 9 as mentioned earlier 2013 2015 rmse values are higher than 2015 rmse values fig 10 this is related to model length extension which increases the mean error between simulation results and measurements for a longer period nevertheless no significant differences are observed for the model parameter value distribution according to rmse values fig 10 which means that the model parameters have the same impact on the adjustment quality between simulated fracture medium gwl and measured gwl regardless of the simulation period this also indicates that even for longer periods the model parameters are calibrated for fitting simulated fracture medium gwl peaks heights and recession curves rather than seasonal gwl variations fig 8 a lag time is observed between the beginning of simulated gwl peaks and the beginning of measured gwl peaks fig 11 probably because the vadose zone responsible for the lag time between the recharge and the gwl response is not taken into account in this saturated model sensitivity analysis of matrix medium hydraulic conductivity km displays similar rmse values fig 10 and no simulated fracture medium gwl modifications are observed for significantly different matrix medium hydraulic conductivity values fig 11 thus km has little influence on fracture medium gwl fitting because of the hydraulic conductivity contrast however the matrix medium effective porosity wcm impacts slightly the simulated fracture medium gwl variations figs 10 and 11 and then water transferred between both media table 3 the higher the wcm the lower the rmse value fig 10 and the shorter the simulated fracture medium gwl recession curve fig 11 this influence on simulated fracture medium gwl variations is linked to the exchange flow between the two media the fracture medium discharges more in the matrix medium in the case of higher wcm producing a shortening of the simulated fracture medium gwl recession curves thus during the may 2015 recharge event increasing wcm increases the recharge rate from water stored in the matrix medium by the fracture medium table 3 the fracture medium hydraulic conductivity kf is the most influential model parameter controlling the gwl equilibrium between the two media increasing kf reduces the fracture medium gwl fig 11 and produces an emptying of the matrix medium by the fracture medium for conserving a gwl baseline during the may 2015 recharge event a more conductive fracture medium discharged less in the matrix medium table 3 since the fracture medium drains more of the matrix medium to conserve a gwl equilibrium between the two media fracture effective porosity wcf influences the simulated fracture medium gwl peak heights and recession curves during recharge events decreasing wcf raises gwl peak heights and shortens recession curves fig 11 during the 2015 may recharge event decreasing wcf increased the recharge rate from water stored in the matrix medium table 3 and corresponded to an increase and shortening of the simulated fracture medium gwl peak height and recession curve fig 11 a less porous fracture medium can be related to more narrow fractures since fracture density is controlled by the exchange parameter as explained in 3 4 2 double medium model specifics the exchange parameter αw is related to distance between fractures reducing αw corresponds to increasing the distance between fractures see eq 4 and then reducing the fracture number in an rev reducing the surface interface between the matrix and fracture media limits the exchange flow from the fracture to the matrix medium during a recharge event which leads to fracture medium gwl peak height increases and recession curve extensions fig 11 low variations of αw produce higher modifications of the recharge rate from water stored in the matrix medium table 3 since αw is directly linked to the exchange flow see eq 4 investigating the distributed model parameter impacts on simulated gwl compared to local measured gwl and the exchange flow between both media during a recharge event allows one to conceptualize the local physical structure and local hydrogeological functioning of the studied site finally these local parameter combinations should be exported in a new spatially distributed model for reproducing spatial and temporal gwl variations of the studied fissured karst aquifer 5 conclusions this study aims at confirming and enhancing the understanding of mechanisms in a fissured karst aquifer using a double medium approach the gerke and van genuchten double porous medium approach is implemented in the metis code and validated for reproducing groundwater level gwl variations the studied karst aquifer is located in burgundy france and considered to be a homogeneous fractured matrix rather than a conduit network embedded in a matrix structure which makes the double medium approach relevant the hydrodynamics are monitored hourly through 18 boreholes three karstic resurgences and the catchment basin outlet river discharge parameter combinations are generated following the latin hypercube sampling method and root mean square error is used as an objective function for determining the adjustment accuracy between simulated fracture medium gwl and borehole measured gwl each borehole representative of the studied site hydrodynamic has an optimal parameter combination this optimization procedure has been feasible thanks to the supercomputer s computing power but double medium flow simulations can be performed without calibrated fracture medium hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity vary from 6 3e to 05 m s 1 and 0 3 to 3 2e 04 m s 1 and 2 4 and the exchange parameter varies from 2 9e 10 m 1 s 1 to 6 5e 10 m 1 s 1 the double medium model has succeeded in reproducing measured gwl variations peak heights recession curves and gwl baseline that were not reproduced by an equivalent porous medium model borehole calibrated model parameter values bring information about the local physical structure of the fissured karst aquifer parameter spatial organization is observed with 1 boreholes located in high fracture density areas producing small gwl peaks and short recession curves after recharge events and 2 one borehole located in an area characterized by higher distance between fractures producing higher gwl peak heights and longer recession curves this spatial parametrization should be used in further works to generate a more spatially distributed double medium model model parameter sensitivity analysis shows that fracture medium hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity as well as the exchange parameter are the most influential parameters on the simulated gwl variation and the exchange flow between both media during a recharge event understanding the influence of model parameters on the simulated groundwater level and the exchange flow between the matrix and fracture media allows one to improve the spatial knowledge of the physical properties as well as the hydrodynamic mechanisms of the fissured karst aquifer this double medium model could be enhanced by accounting for the vadose zone and or the epikarst above the saturated zone of the studied site which could lead to a better reproduction of the measured time lag between recharge events and gwl responses and to a stabilization of the simulated gwl during more or less wet years another promising step will be the simulation of transport using the double medium approach in order to reproduce long tailed breakthrough curves from tracer tests these simulations could highlight the exchange parameter impact on the tracer breakthrough curves and also verify model parameters calibrated by flow simulations further field experiments could be lead to monitor groundwater chemical variations by borehole high frequency sampling during recharge events in order to identify matrix and fracture medium water chemical compositions these experiments could confirm the exchange flow variations for instance from matrix to fracture medium during no recharge event

7047,karst aquifers are known for their complex flow mechanisms produced by the high spatial heterogeneity of void distribution this study aims at confirming and enhancing the understanding of these flow mechanisms in a fissured karst aquifer using flow simulation with a double medium approach groundwater level gwl variations of the studied site a 17 km2 topographic hill located in burgundy france are monitored hourly through 18 boreholes 3 karstic resurgences and the outlet river discharge of the catchment basin 40 km2 the gerke and van genuchten double porosity model is implemented in the metis code and used to simulate gwl variations with a matrix and a fracture medium model parameters are calibrated by fitting a simulated fracture medium gwl to measured gwl for four boreholes that are representative of the topographic hill hydrodynamics the double medium approach succeeds in reproducing measured fast gwl responses after recharge events that are not reproduced by a single medium approach investigating the model parameters impact on simulated gwl variations and the exchange flow between the two media allows the conceptualization of the physical structure and the hydrodynamic mechanisms of the fissured karst aquifer the spatial organization of parameters is observed and indicates areas of higher fracture density producing rapid gwl responses in contrast to lower fracture density areas which produce slower and higher gwl responses the fracture medium hydraulic parameters and the exchange parameter controlling the matrix fracture interface properties are the most influential parameters for the simulated fracture medium gwl and the exchange flow between the matrix and the fracture medium during a recharge event calibrated fracture medium hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity vary respectively from 6 3e to 05 m s 1 and 0 3 to 3 2e 04 m s 1 and 2 4 and the exchange parameter varies from 2 9e 10 m 1 s 1 to 6 5e 10 m 1 s 1 matrix medium hydraulic conductivity variations have little impact on the simulation results while matrix medium effective porosity affects slightly simulated gwl values vary from 11 to 17 finally this study shows the gerke and van genuchten double porous medium validity for the simulation of groundwater level in a fissured karst aquifer keywords hydrogeology modelling karst aquifers double medium approach groundwater level simulations 1 introduction karst aquifers are characterized by a highly heterogeneous distribution of voids created by groundwater flow bakalowicz 2005 these voids allow flow velocities up to several tens m h and the spatial heterogeneity makes physical property and process investigations in karst aquifers difficult since high spatial density underground information is seldom available the physical properties of karst aquifers are usually investigated by the analysis of output data spring hydrographs and chemographs following numerous approaches hydrograph analysis dewandel et al 2003 kovács et al 2005 kovács and perrochet 2008 isotope and major chemical chemograph analysis aquilina et al 2005 delbart et al 2014a ladouche et al 2001 signal processing analysis

al 2011 physically based models are used for groundwater management and pollution infiltration prediction considering karst flow mechanisms therrien and sudicky 1996 these modelling approaches can be subdivided in two groups 1 distributed models that discretize karst systems in two or three dimensional grids and require the assignment of hydraulic parameters and 2 lumped models that conceptualize physical processes at the scale of the whole karst system without explicitly modelling spatial variability fleury et al 2007 fleury et al 2008 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 hartmann et al 2014 lumped models are usually employed when system hydraulic properties are poorly known to simulate karst spring discharge by converting input recharge into output discharge with linear chen et al 2014 fleury et al 2007 fleury et al 2008 or non linear tritz et al 2011 equations distributed karst models can only be applied to well explored sites since they require spatial information on karst system properties in distributed approaches karst hydrological specifics are modelled by 1 a double medium approach that considers two interacting media matrix and fracture conduit with a linear water exchange term depending on their state or 2 a combined discrete continuum approach where fracture conduit networks are modelled as discrete elements embedded in a matrix continuum hartmann et al 2014 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 the double medium approach is used when no conduit networks have been identified in the field kordilla et al 2012 teutsch 1993 or when fracture density is assumed homogeneous on the test site whereas the discrete continuum approach is much used in well developed karst aquifers where conduit geometry is known cornaton and perrochet 2007 hartmann et al 2014 kiraly 1998 therrien and sudicky 1996 double porosity models were first developed for oil reservoir simulation and well test interpretations warren and root 1963 by modelling a porous matrix medium traversed by a fracture network both systems are linked by exchange flow expressed by darcy s law with a shape factor related to the geometry of the matrix blocks in the field of hydrogeology gerke and van genuchten 1993a b proposed a model inspired by the warren and root model for water flow in saturated or unsaturated media in which budget equations are expressed in each medium by the richard s equation formula this double medium model is used in this paper to simulate groundwater level variations without considering the vadose zone and epikarst the studied site located in burgundy france is characterized by a high density of monitoring boreholes that is 18 boreholes in a 17 km2 topographic hill this site has been spatially and temporally investigated through hydrogeological and geochemical studies with natural tracers and cross correlation analysis delbart 2013 delbart et al 2014a delbart et al 2014b delbart et al 2016 this karst aquifer is not well developed since no large conduit networks are known however fracture families have been identified by borehole and outcrop investigations delbart 2013 and previous signal processing analyses of spring hydrographs and borehole groundwater level variations delbart et al 2014b delbart et al 2016 this identification leads one to consider this aquifer as a homogeneous fissured karst aquifer this work aims at confirming and enhancing the understanding of groundwater flow mechanisms in this fissured karst aquifer using flow simulation with a double medium approach working on a spatially well explored test site allows us to calibrate model hydraulic parameters by fitting simulated groundwater level gwl with borehole groundwater level variations similar to the karst spring dynamics delbart 2013 delbart et al 2014a the first part

equivalent porous medium the model parameter optimization method using latin hypercube sampling and root mean square error as objective functions is also introduced then a general context with the available hydrodynamic measurements of the studied site the flow model specifics and recharge computations for single and double medium approaches are presented single medium flow simulation results are first exposed to show their limits for reproducing groundwater level variations then double medium flow simulation results are presented for short and long periods to assess the impact of the period length on calibrated hydraulic parameters a focus on the exchange flow between media is presented that allows one to understand the hydrodynamic model functioning during a recharge event model parameter sensitivity analysis is finally shown to assess the parameters impact on simulated gwl and water transferred between media 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model warren and root 1963 first developed double porosity models for oil reservoir simulation and well test interpretation by modelling a porous matrix medium primary medium traversed by a fracture network secondary medium the authors have proposed a simplified conceptual model made of parallelepiped blocks separated by three sets of orthogonal planar fractures fig 1 flow exchange is controlled by the pressure difference between the two media and expressed by darcy s law with a shape factor related to the shape and size of the blocks the determination of this shape factor and even its theoretical validity are the subject of an important debate see for example bourbiaux et al 1999 or hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2006 in the field of hydrogeology gerke and van genuchten 1993a have proposed a model inspired by the warren and root model for the flow of water in saturated or unsaturated media this model is implemented in the hydrus programme the gerke and van genuchten model is based on the assumption that richard s equation for transient water flow can be applied to both pore systems this assumption leads to the following set of equations in which the budget equations are expressed in each medium for a one dimensional vertical system equation in a representative elementary volume rev inside a fracture 1 c f h f t z k f h f z k f γ w w f s f equation in a matrix rev 2 c m h m t z k m h m z k m γ w 1 w f s m where kf and km l t 1 represent the fracture and matrix pore system hydraulic conductivities hf and hm l represent the fracture and matrix pore system pressure heads γw is the exchange term t 1 describing the transfer of water between the two pore systems sm and sf t 1 are source sink terms to account for root water extraction wf is the volume fraction of the fracture system in the global medium and cm and cf l 1 are the specific soil water capacities expressed by 3 c s w s s ε s w h where sw is the degree of fluid saturation ss l 1 the specific storage coefficient for fracture or

orthogonal fractures γw is an empirical factor and a is equal to half the average distance between fractures in the case of equally spaced main fracture sets β 3 2 2 implementation in the metis code the metis code is being developed by the geosciences department of mines paristech goblet 2017 it solves by the finite element method the equations of flow mass and heat transfer in a three dimensional variably saturated medium it has been used in numerous applications related for instance to the modelling of natural tracers or the estimation of hydrogeological model parameters castro and goblet 2003 patriarche et al 2004 renard et al 2016 one of the characteristics of the metis code is the possibility to include reduced dimensionality elements 1d or 2d elements in a 3d mesh for instance to represent large scale fractures and boreholes joint elements this feature has been used as will be shown later to implement the double porosity model the metis code uses an equivalent continuous medium approach to represent a porous medium as well as a fractured medium to represent a double porosity system two overlapping media are considered in an rev each one occupying all the rev volume this implies that the properties of each medium hydraulic conductivity and porosity must be weighted by its volume fraction to yield an equivalent property i e wf for the fractured medium and 1 wf for the matrix medium the metis code solves the equations of flow with a linear finite element technique according to a standard galerkin formulation the double medium approach is implemented as follows each medium is discretized on a separate mesh over which the conservation equation of the appropriate medium is formulated eqs 5 and 6 for the porous medium 5 d i n i div k m grad h m c m h m t γ w 0 for the fractured medium 6 d i n i k f g r a d h f c f h f t γ w 0 the overlapping meshes communicate through one dimensional elements joint elements in which the connection equation see eq 4 is discretized as a steady state conservation equation that yields the desired flow head relationship the generation of overlapping meshes as well as the connection elements is transparent for the user the resulting discretization is solved on the composite mesh resulting from the assemblage of the overlapping meshes and the connection elements this very flexible setup which is facilitated by the general finite element framework allows representing in any space dimension 1 2 or 3d an arbitrary number of simultaneous media although the double medium has been to date the only one considered in practical applications it allows also including without further development all the options of the single medium simulator i e variable saturation flow mass and heat transfer 2 3 optimization method an optimization procedure has been developed to calibrate hydraulic parameters based on the adjustment between simulated groundwater level gwl and borehole measurements using the latin hypercube sampling lhs method mckay et al 2000 each computation is initiated with a different set of parameters a statistical law is assigned to each parameter normal log normal etc and values are randomly picked following these distributions laws the lhs method ensures that parameter ranges are equally sampled and fully explored flow simulations are computed with these different combinations of parameters simulated and measured gwl variations are compared by root mean square error rmse computations 8 rmse n 1 gwl s gwl m 2 n gwls and gwlm are the simulated and measured groundwater levels respectively rmse is a classical tool used to quantify the accuracy of model results with reality measurements including in hydrology and hydrogeology modelling cousquer 2017 delottier 2017 kordilla et al 2012 moussu et al 2011 each simulation is rated by a rmse value quantifying the accuracy of the fit between model results and field measurements for every borehole thus each borehole has an optimal set of parameters corresponding to the weakest rmse value and reproducing at the best measured gwl this procedure has been chosen rather than an iterative optimization method since calculations are run on a supercomputer that allows testing a huge number of parameter combinations several thousand at the same time this method guaranties a full exploration of the parameter range values avoiding local optima 3 studied site 3 1 localization and general context the studied system is a 17 km2 topographic dome located in eastern france the altitude varies from 356 m to 526 m fig 3a the studied system is part of the main river catchment which has an approximate area of 40 km2 fig 2 the river discharge has been monitored hourly at the catchment outlet since 2009 forest land covers 82 5 of the total topographic hill surface whereas urban and agricultural land represents 17 5 of the total surface annual rainfall of the studied area varies from 732 mm y to 1106 mm y with an average of 901 mm y 2010 2015 météo france data this topographic hill has been investigated through several studies for geological survey hydrogeological and geochemical understanding with field and modelling approaches delbart 2013 delbart et al 2014a delbart et al 2014b delbart et al 2016 the regional stratigraphy is represented by tabular jurassic limestone intersected by marl fig 2 at the catchment scale two aquifers are supported by two impermeable layers this work focuses on the upper bathonian limestone aquifer that drains the studied topographic hill the vadose zone thickness reaches a maximum of 70 m with an average of 45 m at the topographic hill centre the saturated zone reaches a thickness of 15 m at the topographic hill centre the vadose zone and the saturated zone are limited by the southern part of the topographic hill where the bajocian ostra marl appears on the surface fig 2 this superior part of the aquifer is composed of bathonian limestone which is characterized by three types of porosity matrix porosity reflects the rock internal structure fracture porosity is linked to the regional tectonic history and conduit porosity is created by calcite dissolution matrix effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity have been determined by mercury intrusion methods autopore micrométrics 9500 and using a non steady state air permeameter ifp 49 apparatus on rock samples from boreholes bh n 3 4 9 14 and 16 see fig 2 in the saturated zone composed of bathonian oncolite limestone the average matrix effective porosity is 2 6 with a minimum and a maximum of 2 3 and 3 1 for 42 samples and the average matrix hydraulic conductivity is 1 1e 8 m s with a minimum and a maximum matrix hydraulic conductivity of 1 93e 9 and 1 93e 8 for 77 samples fracture porosity has been evaluated by outcrop observations the fracture aperture varies from millimetres up to 20 cm with an average of 3 cm for 654 measured fractures the average distance between two fractures is approximately 2 m for investigated outcrops some karstic voids are observed in the field their sizes can reach a few metres but no large conduit networks are known in the studied system groundwater flows from north northeast to the south and discharges among several karstic resurgences disposed all around the topographic hill fig 3 b the gwl of borehole n 17 located at the topographic hill centre fig 3a is not taken into account for generating the reference piezometric map since this gwl is 35 m higher than the nearby average fig 4 this particular behaviour is still not explained the upper aquifer is also leaking towards the inferior aquifer through faults located in the centre lower part of the studied area fig 5 a 3 2 available data the studied site is particularly well explored with 18 boreholes three karstic resurgences sr n 2 4 and 6 in fig 4 and the river catchment outlet monitored hourly with groundwater level or discharge measurements fig 4 these observation points provide information about the hydrodynamic behaviour at different scales borehole measurements give local information of the gwl fluctuations whereas karstic resurgences integrate the hydrodynamic functioning of the whole topographic hill finally river discharge monitoring provides information about the catchment basin hydrodynamics as shown in fig 4 the gwl dynamic is spatially variable most of the boreholes react rapidly after recharge events demonstrating the necessity of hourly time step monitoring but with different gwl peak heights and recession curves the fast responses of the measured groundwater level springs and river discharge suggest that the studied site hydrodynamics are more related to fracture porosity than matrix porosity where smoother and slower responses should be measured after recharge events boreholes springs and river discharge fig 4 show seasonal variations with low gwl or discharge during summer periods low flow periods some boreholes display gwl drops or thresholds especially during these low flow periods bh n 6 14 and 17 explained by the emptying of fracture networks some boreholes as bh n 2 display small peak heights after recharge events which is typical of boreholes located in a less conductive rock borehole measurements of n 5 and 16 have similar gwl variations due to their proximity in the field 45 m despite these various behaviours the gwl dynamics of boreholes n 8 16 and 17 fig 4 are close to karstic resurgences sr n 6 see fig 4 and the catchment outlet river discharge dynamics this outcome indicates that these boreholes are representative of the topographic hill hydrodynamics as mentioned above gwl measurements for borehole n 17 are higher than gwl measured nearby indicating a particular behaviour that is still not explained however the borehole n 17 gwl dynamics are similar to the topographic hill hydrodynamics fast responses after recharge events fig 4 thus a 35 m vertical offset is applied to simulated gwl for calibrating model parameters which allows reproduction of the measured borehole n 17 gwl hydrodynamics following this assumption four boreholes bh n 5 8 16 and 17 showing the same hydrodynamics are retained for model parameter calibration between the simulated fracture medium and measured groundwater level 3 3 flow model description an unconfined saturated horizontal two dimensional model is used to represent the topographic hill groundwater 17 km2 this domain is discretized by a voronoi type mesh with 15 093 triangular elements of an average area of 1000 m2 fig 5b the substratum surface of the model is interpolated from the marl depth measured in 30 drillings and marl outcrops taking into account geologic discontinuities fig 5a the marl surface is subdivided in planes by strike slip faults interpolations of the marl depths are then carried out for each plane from measured points and the layer mean inclination data smoothing is finally applied to the previous marl surfaces because transitions between two compartments separated by a discontinuity are too abrupt for the hydrogeologic code a fixed hydraulic head boundary condition is applied to the topographic hill limits corresponding to the groundwater emergence fig 5b to the north a no flow boundary condition is set corresponding to the piezometric crest in the central low part of the studied site borehole n 18 see fig 5a faults have brought into contact the two superposed aquifers because of the concentric piezometric isolines fig 5b a vertical leakage is assumed from the superior to the inferior aquifer fig 5b this leakage flow is estimated at 160 mm y by a simple darcy calculation on a 0 13 km2 vertical surface and applied according to the flow model type single or double medium model 3 4 recharge computation the estimation of recharge and the recharge repartition between media are essential for single medium and double medium modelling recharge is computed from an hourly thornthwaite and matter water budget dourado neto et al 2010 taking into account evapotranspiration penman and monteith equation from allen et al 1998 soil water storage capacity fixed to 10 mm to better reproduce groundwater level peaks among the studied site boreholes and runoff the runoff coefficient is estimated from the schaake et al 1967 equation considering the ratio between impermeable and non impermeable surfaces and the topographic mean slope of the studied site which gives a runoff coefficient of 3 7 a mean annual recharge rate of 560 mm y is obtained for the 2010 2015 period to confirm this recharge computation the water budget is calculated at the outlet catchment using the hourly monitored river discharge annual accumulated river flow divided by the river catchment area 40 km2 gives an average recharge rate of 591 mm y for the 2010 2015 period these two recharge rate calculations are consistent since mean annual runoff considered in the thornthwaite and matter water budget is 33 mm y for the 2010 2015 period total recharge cannot be applied directly by an equivalent porous medium for reproducing at the same time borehole gwl baselines peak heights and recession moreover the double medium model requires a recharge repartition for both media thus single medium and double medium model recharge repartitions are related to the catchment basin water budget considering the outlet river discharge as the total outflow of the catchment basin during low flow periods summer periods see fig 4 it is supposed that fracture porosity does not provide water to the matrix porous system thus the mean river discharge baseline 230 l s 1 for the 2010 2015 period fig 4 reflects flow moving through the matrix porosity at the catchment scale related to the catchment basin area it corresponds to a 197 mm y matrix recharge rate following the catchment basin water budget recharge is split into two parts with 1 a steady flow to reproduce the groundwater level baseline to which 2 a percentage of the hourly transient recharge is added to reproduce fast groundwater level responses after recharge events for the single medium approach the 197 mm y matrix recharge is applied as a steady flow and the remaining 363 mm y are hourly transient recharge as a percentage of the recharge time series in the same equivalent porous medium for the double medium approach the 197 mm y matrix recharge is treated as a steady flow to the matrix medium the remaining 363 mm y are hourly transient recharge as a percentage of the recharge time series to the fracture medium 3 5 model parametrization the single medium approach is first performed to test the ability of an equivalent porous medium to reproduce groundwater level variations of the studied fissured karst aquifer flow model geometry and boundary conditions are the same as presented above the single and double medium model hydraulic parameter assignments table 1 are presented for the two approaches 3 5 1 single medium model specifics hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity for the equivalent porous medium are set homogeneously on the whole mesh combinations of these two parameters are generated by the lhs method which ensures that all values of the parameter ranges table 1 are well sampled following statistical laws simulated and measured gwl are then compared by rmse calculations giving the optimal combination of parameters for each borehole among a thousand tested combinations 3 5 2 double medium model specifics the exchange parameter αw is described by an exchange hydraulic conductivity ka and a geometry interface parameter between media αw see eq 4 as mentioned earlier determination of the shape factor β and the transition hydraulic conductivity between media ka is highly discussed in the double porous system modelling literature gerke and van genuchten 1993b have proposed that shape factor could be essentially considered an empirical quantity that must be calibrated to observed field data the interface hydraulic conductivity between the matrix and fracture media is poorly investigated for karst systems few studies gerke and van genuchten 1993a gerke and van genuchten 1993b moench 1984 thoma 1992 have shown that exchange hydraulic conductivity could be much less than the matrix hydraulic conductivity more recently kordilla et al 2012 investigated double continuum saturated and unsaturated flow simulations using the gerke and van genuchten exchange parameter these authors set the interface hydraulic conductivity value identical to the matrix hydraulic conductivity and the geometry interface parameter to a high value such that it does not act as an additional barrier for water transfer between both media in this paper the exchange parameter αw is adjusted as a whole by modifying the space between fractures a the interface hydraulic conductivity has been fixed as the mean matrix hydraulic conductivity and the shape factor β is set to represent parallelepiped matrix blocks separated by fractures thus the total exchange parameter calibration is related to the space between fractures calibration hydraulic conductivity effective porosity and the exchange parameter for each medium are set homogeneously on the whole mesh parameter combinations are generated by the lhs method and the optimal set of parameters is obtained using rmse as the objective function between the simulated fracture medium and measured gwl for each borehole among a thousand tested parameter combinations matrix hydraulic parameter values are constrained by field values table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 single medium approach the model parameter optimization procedure previously introduced is first performed for single medium flow simulations to test the ability of an equivalent porous medium to reproduce the measured gwl in boreholes strongly influenced by fractures as shown infig 6 a using the recharge repartition estimated from the catchment basin water budget does not allow reproduction of measured gwl variations the recession curves are too long this recharge repartition is not adapted for one equivalent porous medium with the hydraulic parameter tested values table 1 the recharge transient part should be reduced to decrease the gwl peak heights and shorten recession curves further calculations have been performed using the lhs method to adjust the recharge transient part of the model a 56 mm y transient recharge gives the best adjustment fig 6b using hydraulic parameter values coherent with field values table 1 between simulated and measured gwl for borehole n 16 however this recharge parametrization means that only 10 of the total recharge 560 mm y is hourly transient recharge to the equivalent medium which is much less than the 65 estimated from the catchment basin water budget despite this recharge calibration the simulated recession curves are still longer and peak heights are smaller than the measured recession curves fig 6b justifying the necessity of a second porous medium to reproduce the rapid gwl variations after recharge events 4 2 double medium approach the model parameter optimization procedure is performed for flow simulations with the double medium approach matrix and fractured medium hydraulic parameters just like the exchange parameter are adjusted to reproduce the rapid gwl recession curves after recharge events as mentioned above the simulated fracture medium and measured gwl level are compared through the objective function rmse since the studied site hydrodynamics are related to fracture porosity two simulation periods are observed 1 a one year short period with a two year model initialisation period to assess the ability of the double medium model to reproduce gwl peak heights and recession curves and 2 a three year long period with a three year initialisation period to evaluate the ability of the double medium model to reproduce gwl seasonal variations parameter sets are compared between the two simulation periods table 2 finally the simulated matrix and fracture medium gwl variations are presented in parallel with the exchange flow between both media during a major recharge event fig 9 this analysis is shown for borehole n 16 and allows one to understand the model hydrodynamic functioning during a recharge event calibrated matrix medium effective porosities which vary from 11 to 17 table 2 are higher than field effective porosity measurements which vary from 2 to 7 table 1 suggesting that selected non fissured rock samples for mercury intrusions were not representative of the global matrix effective porosity of the studied site but rather of non porous matrix rock samples these higher calibrated matrix effective porosity values can also indicate an excessive recharge steady flow in the matrix medium not adapted to field measured matrix effective porosities recharge repartition optimization between both media could be envisaged in further calculations to verify the actual recharge repartition cf 3 4 for the same simulation period borehole rmse values table 2 cannot be compared with each other because the boreholes have different groundwater level dynamics and peak heights especially bh n 17 because of the gwl thresholds during summer periods fig 4 4 2 1 short term simulation analysis the presented results correspond to the best adjustment weakest rmse value among a thousand tested parameter combinations for each borehole obtained from the model parameter optimization procedure for one year following a two year initialisation period simulated fracture medium gwl variations show a good fit with the measured gwl of the boreholes of interest n 5 8 16 and 17 as shown in fig 7 rapid gwl recession curves not reproduced by the single medium model fig 6 and gwl peak heights are reproduced by the double medium model during may 2015 a major rainfall event 77 mm in 69 h was recorded on the studied site with a gwl response time after recharge less than 20 h this event is also well reproduced by the model in terms of height and recession curves other boreholes of the studied site are not investigated since they show specific gwl variations thresholds small peaks reactions to only few recharge events see fig 4 that are not reproduced by this double medium model an offset is applied to borehole n 17 simulated fracture medium gwl for fixing the difference with measured gwl 35 m this allows for calibrating a parameter combination to reproduce the particular hydrodynamic behaviour of borehole n 17 the rmse is then computed between the adjusted simulated fracture medium and measured gwls calibrated parameter values table 2 suggest a spatial organization for the four boreholes boreholes n 5 8 16 are located in the southern part of the topographic hill and borehole n 17 is located at the topographic hill centre fig 2 these two sets of boreholes are distinguished by the fracture medium effective porosity and exchange parameter values since the exchange parameter is related to the distance between fractures these two different parameter combinations give local information about the physical properties and the structure of the fissured karst aquifer boreholes located in the topographic hill southern part bh n 5 8 and 16 display a mean fracture medium effective porosity of 0 014 and a mean exchange parameter of 4 3e 09 m 1 s 1 corresponding to a mean matrix block size of 24 m producing small simulated fracture medium gwl peaks and short recession curves fig 7 borehole n 17 located in the topographic hill centre displays a fracture medium effective porosity of 0 004 and an exchange parameter of 3 8e 10 m 1 s 1 corresponding to a matrix block size of 80 m the fracture medium nearby borehole n 17 has a lower effective porosity than the fracture medium in the southern part of the topographic hill combining a low exchange parameter value and a less porous fracture medium allows reproduction of higher gwl fluctuation and longer recession curves fig 7 this local distribution of the fracture medium hydraulic parameters and the exchange parameter is a consequence of the spatial heterogeneity of gwl variations related to the fracture spatial distribution of the studied site 4 2 2 long term simulation analysis a long simulation period is investigated to evaluate the ability of the double medium model to reproduce seasonal and annual gwl variations as well as the impact of the data s length on the calibrated hydraulic parameter values the presented results correspond to the best adjustment among a thousand tested parameter combinations for borehole n 16 weakest rmse value obtained from the model parameter optimization procedure for a six year simulation period 2010 2015 including a three year stabilization period 2010 2012 as shown in the fig 8 the simulated fracture medium gwl variations of borehole n 16 are reproduced for a longer simulation period simulated fracture medium gwl is lower than measured gwl for the 2013 january may period because of the mean annual recharge contrast between previous years 585 mm for 2012 and the beginning of the presented period 759 mm for 2013 the simulated fracture medium gwl is directly linked to recharge since no vadose zone is accounted for in this model the studied site mean vadose zone is approximately 50 m thus considering this unsaturated zone could lead to gwl baseline stabilization over more or less wet periods extending the simulation period logically produces a deterioration of the adjustment quality higher rmse values table 2 between the simulated fracture medium and measured gwl optimal model parameter values are similar for each borehole between the two simulation periods table 2 except for matrix medium hydraulic conductivity which does not impact the simulated fracture medium gwl as shown later fig 10 4 2 3 model hydrodynamic functioning investigating the hydrodynamic model functioning during a recharge event allows one to understand the flow mechanisms taking place between the matrix and fracture systems in the fissured karst aquifer simulated matrix and fracture medium gwl variations are presented in parallel with the exchange flow between both media during a major recharge event fig 9 for zero recharge periods the matrix gwl is a few decimetres above the fracture gwl fig 9a thus exchange flow is oriented from the matrix towards the fracture medium see eq 4 during recharge events the fracture medium gwl peaks pass over the matrix medium gwl indicating an inversion of the exchange flow between both media the matrix medium provides water to the fracture medium in such a way that gwl baseline is maintained in the fracture medium for zero recharge periods during recharge events the impulse signal is either evacuated through the fractured medium to the model boundaries or temporarily stored in the matrix medium or probably both the balance between these two processes is strongly linked to the model parameters as presented later the exchange flow oriented from the fracture medium towards the matrix medium corresponding to the red area below the exchange flow curve fig 9b is compared to the recharge amount for the same event thus during the recharge event of 2015 may considering the optimal model parameter combination for borehole n 16 39 of the recharge event is stored in the matrix medium fig 9b and the remaining 61 is evacuated through the fracture medium to the model boundaries therefore as expected the model hydrodynamics are controlled by the pressure gradient between both media the emptying of the fracture medium during zero recharge periods is balanced by an exchange flow oriented from the matrix to the fractured medium which corresponds in the field to a draining of the matrix porosity the increase of the fractured medium gwl during recharge events induces an exchange flux from the fracture to the matrix medium which corresponds in the field to a recharge of the matrix porosity the amount of recharge water stored in the matrix medium and the matrix recharge draining processes will become more important in the case of a double medium transport model where simulated tracer restitution curves are calibrated to measured curves in the field indeed a more or less important recharge rate stored in the matrix medium depending on the model parameters as presented later could delay the tracer restitution in the model 4 3 sensitivity analysis adjustment quality between simulated and measured gwl depends on the combination of model parameters nevertheless assessing a parameter s individual impact on simulated gwl and the exchange flow gives information about the influence and role of each parameter in the double medium model parametrization a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to highlight the impact of each parameter on the simulated fracture medium groundwater level variations for the two simulation periods and on the water transfer between both media during a recharge event for borehole n 16 four parameters have been fixed to their optimal values table 2 and one modified in accordance with previously presented parameter ranges table 1 rmse is used as the objective function for comparing the adjustment accuracy between the simulated fracture medium and measured gwl individual parameter values are plotted versus rmse values fig 10 and each parameter s individual impact on the simulated fracture medium gwl variations are presented fig 11 the impact of each parameter on the water transfer between the two media is also presented by computing the recharge rate from the fracture medium into the matrix medium during the 2015 may recharge event table 3 as previously introduced fig 9 as mentioned earlier 2013 2015 rmse values are higher than 2015 rmse values fig 10 this is related to model length extension which increases the mean error between simulation results and measurements for a longer period nevertheless no significant differences are observed for the model parameter value distribution according to rmse values fig 10 which means that the model parameters have the same impact on the adjustment quality between simulated fracture medium gwl and measured gwl regardless of the simulation period this also indicates that even for longer periods the model parameters are calibrated for fitting simulated fracture medium gwl peaks heights and recession curves rather than seasonal gwl variations fig 8 a lag time is observed between the beginning of simulated gwl peaks and the beginning of measured gwl peaks fig 11 probably because the vadose zone responsible for the lag time between the recharge and the gwl response is not taken into account in this saturated model sensitivity analysis of matrix medium hydraulic conductivity km displays similar rmse values fig 10 and no simulated fracture medium gwl modifications are observed for significantly different matrix medium hydraulic conductivity values fig 11 thus km has little influence on fracture medium gwl fitting because of the hydraulic conductivity contrast however the matrix medium effective porosity wcm impacts slightly the simulated fracture medium gwl variations figs 10 and 11 and then water transferred between both media table 3 the higher the wcm the lower the rmse value fig 10 and the shorter the simulated fracture medium gwl recession curve fig 11 this influence on simulated fracture medium gwl variations is linked to the exchange flow between the two media the fracture medium discharges more in the matrix medium in the case of higher wcm producing a shortening of the simulated fracture medium gwl recession curves thus during the may 2015 recharge event increasing wcm increases the recharge rate from water stored in the matrix medium by the fracture medium table 3 the fracture medium hydraulic conductivity kf is the most influential model parameter controlling the gwl equilibrium between the two media increasing kf reduces the fracture medium gwl fig 11 and produces an emptying of the matrix medium by the fracture medium for conserving a gwl baseline during the may 2015 recharge event a more conductive fracture medium discharged less in the matrix medium table 3 since the fracture medium drains more of the matrix medium to conserve a gwl equilibrium between the two media fracture effective porosity wcf influences the simulated fracture medium gwl peak heights and recession curves during recharge events decreasing wcf raises gwl peak heights and shortens recession curves fig 11 during the 2015 may recharge event decreasing wcf increased the recharge rate from water stored in the matrix medium table 3 and corresponded to an increase and shortening of the simulated fracture medium gwl peak height and recession curve fig 11 a less porous fracture medium can be related to more narrow fractures since fracture density is controlled by the exchange parameter as explained in 3 4 2 double medium model specifics the exchange parameter αw is related to distance between fractures reducing αw corresponds to increasing the distance between fractures see eq 4 and then reducing the fracture number in an rev reducing the surface interface between the matrix and fracture media limits the exchange flow from the fracture to the matrix medium during a recharge event which leads to fracture medium gwl peak height increases and recession curve extensions fig 11 low variations of αw produce higher modifications of the recharge rate from water stored in the matrix medium table 3 since αw is directly linked to the exchange flow see eq 4 investigating the distributed model parameter impacts on simulated gwl compared to local measured gwl and the exchange flow between both media during a recharge event allows one to conceptualize the local physical structure and local hydrogeological functioning of the studied site finally these local parameter combinations should be exported in a new spatially distributed model for reproducing spatial and temporal gwl variations of the studied fissured karst aquifer 5 conclusions this study aims at confirming and enhancing the understanding of mechanisms in a fissured karst aquifer using a double medium approach the gerke and van genuchten double porous medium approach is implemented in the metis code and validated for reproducing groundwater level gwl variations the studied karst aquifer is located in burgundy france and considered to be a homogeneous fractured matrix rather than a conduit network embedded in a matrix structure which makes the double medium approach relevant the hydrodynamics are monitored hourly through 18 boreholes three karstic resurgences and the catchment basin outlet river discharge parameter combinations are generated following the latin hypercube sampling method and root mean square error is used as an objective function for determining the adjustment accuracy between simulated fracture medium gwl and borehole measured gwl each borehole representative of the studied site hydrodynamic has an optimal parameter combination this optimization procedure has been feasible thanks to the supercomputer s computing power but double medium flow simulations can be performed without calibrated fracture medium hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity vary from 6 3e to 05 m s 1 and 0 3 to 3 2e 04 m s 1 and 2 4 and the exchange parameter varies from 2 9e 10 m 1 s 1 to 6 5e 10 m 1 s 1 the double medium model has succeeded in reproducing measured gwl variations peak heights recession curves and gwl baseline that were not reproduced by an equivalent porous medium model borehole calibrated model parameter values bring information about the local physical structure of the fissured karst aquifer parameter spatial organization is observed with 1 boreholes located in high fracture density areas producing small gwl peaks and short recession curves after recharge events and 2 one borehole located in an area characterized by higher distance between fractures producing higher gwl peak heights and longer recession curves this spatial parametrization should be used in further works to generate a more spatially distributed double medium model model parameter sensitivity analysis shows that fracture medium hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity as well as the exchange parameter are the most influential parameters on the simulated gwl variation and the exchange flow between both media during a recharge event understanding the influence of model parameters on the simulated groundwater level and the exchange flow between the matrix and fracture media allows one to improve the spatial knowledge of the physical properties as well as the hydrodynamic mechanisms of the fissured karst aquifer this double medium model could be enhanced by accounting for the vadose zone and or the epikarst above the saturated zone of the studied site which could lead to a better reproduction of the measured time lag between recharge events and gwl responses and to a stabilization of the simulated gwl during more or less wet years another promising step will be the simulation of transport using the double medium approach in order to reproduce long tailed breakthrough curves from tracer tests these simulations could highlight the exchange parameter impact on the tracer breakthrough curves and also verify model parameters calibrated by flow simulations further field experiments could be lead to monitor groundwater chemical variations by borehole high frequency sampling during recharge events in order to identify matrix and fracture medium water chemical compositions these experiments could confirm the exchange flow variations for instance from matrix to fracture medium during no recharge event

7048,the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model was used to derive estimates of suspended sediment concentration ssc and suspended sediment load ssl their dependence on discharge and their trends with confidence intervals for one site each on the lowermost mississippi and atchafalaya rivers the wrtds model reduces uncertainty in sscs related to variable streamflow conditions flow normalized sscs in each river were similar and decreased from about 260 mg l to 130 mg l from 1980 through 2015 combined annual ssl in the two rivers decreased from about 200 megatons per year mt y to about 100 mt y declines in ssc and ssl were more gradual from 2005 through 2015 and show signs of stabilizing our estimates of ssl in 2015 differ markedly from several recently published estimates of current and projected future mississippi river ssls which were generally around 200 mt y however these values came mostly from a different site upstream on the mississippi river the relationship between ssc and streamflow differed in an important way between the two rivers ssc increased as streamflow increased for the entire range of observed streamflow in the atchafalaya river in the mississippi river ssc followed the same pattern during low and moderate streamflow but decreased at the highest streamflow that tended to occur between january and july since much of the water flowing in the atchafalaya originates from the mississippi river the difference suggests a within basin source of suspended sediment for the atchafalaya river that is absent in the lower mississippi river these findings have important implications for the restoration of deltaic wetlands in coastal louisiana accurate estimates of the ssl available in each river are crucial for understanding how effective diversions of river water into adjacent estuaries will be in sustaining these wetlands our study demonstrates that there might be far less sediment available than previously reported further the difference in the relationship between ssc and streamflow in the two rivers is highly relevant to the ongoing discussion of coastal restoration strategies because the delta building that is occurring at the mouth of the atchafalaya river is frequently used as a model of what could be expected with controlled diversions in the lower mississippi river delta the differences in the ssc behavior with changes in streamflow between the two rivers needs to be considered when results from the atchafalaya river system are projected to those of the mississippi river keywords water quality wrtds trend analysis coastal restoration 1 introduction sediment transported by the lower mississippi and atchafalaya rivers is crucial to the sustainability of coastal louisiana wetlands including those of the delta plain blum and roberts 2012 khalil et al 2010 bentley et al 2014 groves et al 2016 the majority of the sediment delivered to the coast is derived from the contiguous united states and its estimated magnitude and recent trends are variable while the need for a well defined sediment budget for the mississippi atchafalaya delta has long been recognized kesel et al 1992 gramling et al 2006 khalil et al 2010 allison and meselhe 2010 allison et al 2012 a consensus on the sediment source term for this budget is uncertain the hydrography of the lower mississippi atchafalaya river basin is complex as the mississippi river enters its distributary system a portion of the river is diverted west through the old river control structure and converges with the red river to form the atchafalaya river fig 1 both river basins consist of a system of distributary channels complicated by artificial levees and floodways typically overall flow and sediment transport into the delta is estimated as the sum from the lower mississippi and atchafalaya rivers two locations along each river have been used in previous studies to determine loads to the delta on the mississippi river these locations are tarbert landing or st francisville located 14 km 9 mi and 18 km 53 mi downstream from the old river control structure respectively on the atchafalaya river these locations are simmesport or melville located 8 km 5 mi and 48 km 30 mi downstream from the river s origin at the confluence of the old river diversion with the red river fig 1 the combined sediment load of the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers represents the ultimate source term for the complex poorly defined sediment budget delivered downstream the existence of an adequate sediment source is critical for the success of diversions constructed to deliver sediment to louisiana coastal marshes the adequacy of the current sediment supply for the success of proposed diversions is uncertain maulhardt 2015 to help guide the maintenance and restoration of coastal louisiana wetlands the current sediment source term as well as the most recent trajectories need to be clearly defined diversions without a high ssc may not be able to raise the ground level through deposition fast enough to keep pace with relative sea level rise snedden et al 2007 furthermore the 2012 louisiana master plan coastal protection and restoration authority 2012 discusses the possibility of changes in river streamflow and associated sediment load but does not discuss ssc or quantify ssls as knopman et al 2014 stated the framework explicitly dealt with uncertainties in sea level rise subsidence storm frequency and intensity economic development and the fragility of engineered protective structures but it does not deal with uncertainty in ssc or ssl entering the delta the rates and magnitudes of changes in ssc and ssl differ substantially depending on the study period method of trend analysis and which river and site are considered tables 1 and 2 to determine current values and recent trends of ssc and ssl entering coastal louisiana through the combined mississippi atchafalaya rivers we used the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model wrtds exhibits better estimation accuracy and lower bias in comparison to other load estimation methods and allows for more flexibility in the relationship between concentration and flow conditions moyer et al 2012 hirsch 2014 lee et al 2016 chanat et al 2016 our results are based on the most downstream station on each river that have sufficient long term record and represent the most up to date concentration and loads being delivered to the delta complex we also used the model to explore the seasonal variability of relations between ssc and streamflow over time finally we discuss the implication of these results to coastal wetland restoration in the gulf of mexico these analyses and considerations are crucial to guiding restoration efforts of coastal louisiana wetlands optimally 1 1 previous studies previous studies in the lower mississippi and atchafalaya rivers document declines in sediment loads since the 1920s kesel 2003 jacobson et al 2009 alexander et al 2012 in the mississippi river five studies found downward trends in ssl ranging from 0 33 to 0 84 percent per year at tarbert landing and two studies found declines from 1 8 to 4 4 percent per year at st francisville for trend years beginning between 1959 and 1994 and ending between 1978 and 2009 table 1 fig s1 two studies detected a gently increasing recent trend horowitz 2010 xu and rosen 2012 rosen 2013 and two other studies found no trend keown et al 1986 little and biedenharn 2014 also the studies that investigated trends in ssc typically found decreases similar to those in ssl in general estimates of ssl typically the ssl of the reported trend end year are higher at tarbert landing ranging from 109 to 161 megatons per year mt y compared to st francisville where the two studies conducted there report 87 and 91 mt year table 1 substantial differences in ssc and ssl between the two long term monitoring stations at tarbert landing and simmesport and the corresponding downstream stations of st francisville and melville respectively have been observed allison and meselhe 2010 the differences may be due to differing sample techniques and analysis differences in sample collection depths and depositional areas located between the two sites on each river fewer studies have addressed changes in ssc or ssl in the atchafalaya river two studies were conducted at simmesport and found ssls of 49 and 94 mt year table 1 fig s2 keown et al 1986 blum and roberts 2009 at melville rebich and demcheck 2007 estimated decreasing trends of 4 6 percent per year in ssl but no trend in ssc over the ten year period from 1993 to 2004 estimates of annual ssc and ssl for 2004 were 211 mg l and 44 mt y respectively a few previous studies also calculated estimates of total suspended sediment load entering the combined lower mississippi atchafalaya deltas table 2 fig s3 these estimates are calculated as the sum of annual ssls from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers reported here as the estimates from trend end years or as an assumed future load depending on the study reported trend end year estimates range from 255 mt year of suspended sediment entering the delta in 1978 keown et al 1986 to lower recent estimates of 131 in 2004 and 167 mt year in 2006 by rebich and demcheck 2007 and blum and roberts 2009 respectively 2 methods for the wrtds analyses we used ssc data collected from the mississippi river near st francisville louisiana ms stfr and from the atchafalaya river at melville louisiana ac melv fig 1 ssc data were collected by the u s geological survey usgs mostly as part of the national water stream quality accounting network nasqan and national water quality network nwqn programs from as early as 1979 through 2015 ssc samples were collected using isokinetic depth integrated sampling techniques described in the usgs national field manual for the collection of water quality data usgs variously dated ssc data were retrieved from the usgs national water information system u s geological survey 2016 streamflow data were not available at either water quality site instead we used daily computed streamflow at tarbert landing u s army corps of engineers 2016a for ms stfr and daily computed streamflow at simmesport u s army corps of engineers 2016b for ac melv table 3 data used for trend analysis were screened according to the following criteria 1 a site must have a minimum of bimonthly results 6 ssc samples each year 2 at least 10 years of continuous streamflow record with no more than 2 consecutive years without data and 3 suspended sediment samples collected across a range of streamflow conditions and across all seasons wrtds was selected to estimate annual mean ssc and total ssl at ms stfr and ac melv this model has been extensively described in hirsch et al 2010 hirsch and de cicco 2015 and hirsch et al 2015 but a brief overview is provided here the wrtds analysis was completed using the exploration and graphics for river trends egret r package hirsch et al 2015 version 2 6 0 wrtds models concentration as a function of time flow and seasonal components 1 ln c β 0 β 1 t β 2 ln q β 3 sin 2 π t β 4 cos 2 π t ε where ln is the natural log c is suspended sediment concentration βn are fitted coefficients t is time q is mean daily discharge and ε is unexplained variability wrtds fits this model at about 8000 nodes across a discharge time grid estimates of daily concentrations are computed by bilinear interpolation of the values on this grid e g fig s3 daily mean discharge values at each site are gridded by 14 equidistant values in log space and time is gridded at 1 16th of a year at each of these nodes equation 1 is fit using locally weighted regression specifically a weighted tobit model at each calibration node the observations in the dataset are weighted according to their similarity to the calibration point in terms of time season time of year and discharge weights for the observations in the calibration dataset are assigned using a tricube weight function according to distance in time distance in season fractional portion of the year and distance in discharge relative to the conditions at the calibration point the half window widths used for these variables in our study were 7 years for time and 0 5 year for season for both sites and 1 and 2 natural log discharge units for discharge at ms stfr and ac melv respectively the discharge window was narrowed for ms stfr to better capture the downturn of the concentration discharge relationship at high flows at this site the half window width for time was allowed to become larger near the beginning and end of the record so that there were always 14 years of data being used in model calibration for each node in the time discharge grid the individually calibrated models are used to estimate concentration each model gives the natural log of concentration which is exponentiated and multiplied by a bias correction factor to give the estimated concentration in milligrams per liter mg l of suspended sediment the bias correction factor is also specific to each node and is computed using the standard error daily estimates are then derived using bilinear interpolation of the estimates at the nodes load is then computed for each day using the daily mean discharge for the day using the above method expected values of concentration can be determined for all possible combinations of discharge season and time in the given dataset and provide a useful means of characterizing the behavior of concentration as a function of these variables these estimates of the expected value of concentration are often displayed across a discharge time grid for each site fig s3 in supplementary material these expected values were used to explore changes over time in concentration discharge relationships during particular times of the year expected values of concentration were summarized to monthly means at given discharge magnitudes and plotted for specified months and years in many rivers including the two sites used in this study concentration and load are influenced by streamflow and streamflow driven variability in concentration and load estimates can obscure the overall trends in water quality at a site even though annual mean streamflow showed no significant changes during 1980 through 2015 fig s4 at ms stfr mann kendall media slope 14 m3 s yr p 0 84 or ac melv mann kendall media slope 7 m3 s yr p 0 80 wrtds uses flow normalization to account for the variability of concentration or load estimates due to random year to year variation in streamflow specifically for each calendar day n 365 a probability distribution of daily discharge is compiled from the observed daily discharge record for the sites used in our study the period of record is from 1980 through 2015 so each calendar day would have 36 daily flows values one from each year in the period of record then for each day in the period of record the calibrated models are run using each of the 36 daily flow values for the given calendar day and the average of these 36 concentration estimates is the flow normalized fn concentration for that day for example a fn concentration estimate for july 15 2000 would use 36 daily flow values for july 15th across the period of record estimates for each combination of these 36 flow values and the july 15 2000 date would be determined from interpolation from the grid of values described above the fn concentration estimate for this date would use the average of these 36 concentration values the fn load estimate for this date would be computed in the same manner except that the concentration values are each multiplied by streamflow and a conversion factor the fn load estimate for this date is the average of these 36 load values the method allows the estimated trends when expressed as a percentage change to be different for concentration and load like estimates of concentration and load fn estimates of concentration and load are averaged or summed over the year to give annual estimates fn estimates show less variability than standard estimates because fn estimates represent the behavior of concentration and load with the year to year variations in flow reduced the trends reported in this analysis are the difference in fn concentration or load between the first and last years of a given trend period wrtds was originally developed as an exploratory data analysis tool and recently a bootstrap method has extended the application of wrtds to characterize the uncertainty of annual estimates and trends a thorough presentation of this methodology referred to as the wrtds bootstrap test wbt is presented in hirsch et al 2015 and briefly summarized here bootstrap replicates were developed using a time based resampling approach where predefined blocks of consecutive days were randomly drawn with replacement from the period of record samples were drawn until the number of samples in the bootstrap replicate equaled the number of samples in the observed dataset for this analysis we used a block length of 200 days and 100 bootstrap replicates at each site each bootstrap replicate was run using the standard wrtds analysis after which all the annual estimates of fn concentration and fn load along with the trends calculated between two specified years were retained these trend estimates are used to determine the 90 confidence intervals of the annual values and trend also this information provides an estimate of how likely the given trend is likelihood and a statistic that is functionally equivalent to a p value hirsch et al 2015 encouraged the use of a specified terminology to describe the uncertainty results from the wbt this language is similar to the terminology used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and is based on the likelihood of the magnitude and direction of the trend hirsch et al 2015 the likelihood values are the number of upward or downward trends relative to all the bootstrap runs we describe the trends presented here using this language table 2 of hirsch et al 2015 the uncertainty analysis was preformed using the egret confidence intervals ci r package version 1 0 3 hirsch et al 2015 the input and output data files for the wrtds model used in the study are available from murphy and mize 2018 3 results the temporal patterns of annual ssc and ssl estimates are generally similar between sites on the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers symbols connected by dotted lines in fig 2 in the 1980s the flow normalized ssc trends exceeded the mean concentration 260 mg l in both rivers ssc trends converged in the 1990s and appear to be relatively level at about 130 mg l since 2005 fig 2 murphy and mize 2018 annual mean sscs at ms stfr and ac melv have a similar range of values except for a period between 1983 and 1994 during this period sscs at ac melv were considerably higher and showed a different temporal pattern than the concentrations at ms stfr interestingly during 1987 and 1988 the entire mississippi river watershed experienced extreme drought conditions lins and slack 1999 that may correspond to the observed lower concentrations in both rivers compared to the surrounding years after 1995 the annual ssc and ssl at the two sites were very highly associated with each other fig 2 flow normalized ssc fn ssc and load fn ssl decreased from 1980 through 2015 solid line in fig 2 the largest decreases occurred prior to the late 2000s fn ssc decreased by about 50 percent in both rivers from 1980 to 2015 but only decreased by 6 and 11 percent from 2005 to 2015 at ms stfr and ac melv respectively table 4 over the same 1980 2015 trend period fn ssl decreased by 51 percent at ms stfr from about 137 to 67 mt y and 43 percent at ac melv from about 58 to 33 mt y more recent declines in fn ssl 2005 2015 are slightly larger in the atchafalaya river 16 compared to the mississippi river 11 table 4 in general the patterns of fn ssc and fn ssl estimates over time are similar between the sites except for the increase then decrease of ssc and ssl between 1980 and 1992 in the atchafalaya river from 1980 to the peak in 1985 fn ssc increased by about 10 percent and fn ssl increased by about 17 fig 2 the overall decreasing trends of sscs and ssls at both sites agree with some previous studies allison and meselhe 2010 rebich and demcheck 2007 table 1 completed in these rivers but clearly disagree with others keown et al 1986 xu and rosen 2012 rosen 2013 little and biedenharn 2014 table 1 4 discussion 4 1 decreasing suspended sediment the drivers of the large historical declines in ssc and ssl in the mississippi river include channel improvements reservoir construction and soil conservation practices keown et al 1986 meade and moody 2010 tweel and turner 2012 the most intensive period of dam construction and channel alteration cutoffs revetments and dikes on the mississippi and its major tributaries ran from the 1920s through the 1960s with construction at a slower pace in the 1970s kesel 2003 jacobson et al 2009 alexander et al 2012 during this entire period direct effects of major modifications caused a large decrease in sediment load and channels continued to respond geomorphically after construction was largely completed smith and winkley 1996 kesel 2003 on the red river a major contributor of sediment to the atchafalaya construction of a lock and dam system continued until 1994 pinkard and stewart 2001 red river waterway commission 2016 after 1994 ssl and ssc in the atchafalaya appear to have declined abruptly and thereafter their trends resemble those in the mississippi fig 2 the increased implementation of soil conservation practices reduced the amount of sediment leaving agricultural lands throughout the smaller contributing basins knox 1987 alexander et al 2012 effects of soil conservation and channel stabilization in the entire mississippi river basin are highly variable ranging from negligible to large decreases in sediment yield myers et al 2000 pinkard and stewart 2001 garbrecht and starks 2009 neal 2014 u s department of agriculture conservation effects assessment project ceap 2013 assessments indicate that soil conservation has reduced annual ssl delivered to the gulf of mexico from the mississippi atchafalaya system by 4 relative to the no soil conservation case and that implementing conservation in undertreated acres would reduce ssl another 5 most analyses of ssls from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers have detected a recent decreasing trend since 2005 the declines in ssl have slowed apparently due to the geomorphic evolution of large navigable river channels toward stability changes in land use meade and moody 2010 morang et al 2013 and possibly commercial dredging alexander et al 2012 current sources of sediment in the mississippi are about 25 from channel degradation and 75 from upland erosion white et al 2014 in general sand loads are stable and changes in loads are driven by changing concentrations of silt and clay biedenharn et al 2000 heimann et al 2011 according to nittrouer and viparelli 2014 sand stored in river channels will be a stable long term source of sediment that can be transported in higher streamflow events but this source may be sensitive to the sand supply and the amount of sand in storage allison et al 2012 based on the recognized drivers of ssc and ssl the declining trends are unlikely to be reversed existing dams and channel improvements will likely be preserved for the sake of their navigation and flood control benefits strategies for reversing the declining trend in ssl include bypassing clogged dams bentley et al 2012 but this approach could be as costly as the dams themselves were to construct kemp et al 2016 values ascribed to soil conservation myers et al 2000 garbrecht and starks 2009 neal 2014 ceap 2013 suggest that it will continue to be promoted 4 2 uncertainty of decreasing trends there is a high amount of confidence in the finding of decreasing ssc and ssl from 1980 to 2015 in both rivers most of the histogram for the 1980 2015 trends for ssc and ssl at ms stfr and ac melv plot to the far left tail of the distributions typically with trend estimates ranging between 60 and 20 percent depending on the site fig 3 these 36 year trends are considered highly likely with likelihoods ranging from 0 995 to 0 965 table 4 the shorter more recent 2005 2015 trends are considered very likely with likelihoods range from 0 916 to 0 946 table 4 the density histograms for the 2005 2015 trends extend into positive percent changes on the right tail of these distributions fig 3 thus we are less confident in these most recent declines of ssc and ssl compared to the 1980 2015 trends also the p values associated with these more recent trends are typically 0 10 and in a strict null hypothesis testing approach using a significance level of 0 05 would be considered not significant however the density histograms show that a majority of the bootstrapped runs returned negative percent changes and only the upper tail of the distribution crosses into positive values and indicate that decreases in ssc and ssl between 2005 and 2015 are more likely to have occurred than not a standard non significant result for this trend period would be far less informative a close inspection of fn ssc and fn ssl over time suggests decreases from 2005 to 2008 and then minimally varying fn ssc and fn ssl through 2015 fig 2 this pattern is also reflected in the 90 percent confidence intervals however the 90 percent confidence interval envelope displays the range of concentrations and loads and does appear to allow several scenarios for this most recent 11 year period consistent decreases through the period appear possible for ssc and ssl at ms stfr and ssc at ac melv however the 90 percent confidence interval for ssl at ac melv appears to bend and narrow around 2009 restricting the possible scenarios and suggesting a leveling off of decreasing ssl during this period fig 2b 4 3 seasonal changes in suspended sediment the relationship between ssc and streamflow ssc q varies seasonally and between each site on the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers fig 4 at both sites ssc increases with increasing streamflow however at ms stfr this relationship changes at the highest flows which normally occur winter through summer january july similar to findings by mossa 1996 and welch et al 2014 during these times of year and at the highest flows flow magnitudes in this study near 20 000 m3 s sscs are diluted with continued increases in streamflow this reversal in the ssc q relationship is not present at ac melv instead ssc increases with increasing streamflow during all seasons since the dominant source of water to both rivers is the upper mississippi river increases in ssc related to higher streamflow that occur in the atchafalaya but not in the mississippi indicate an in stream sediment source within the atchafalaya basin that may contribute to the ssc during these scouring events during the 2011 flood in the lower mississippi atchafalaya river basin welch et al 2014 noted that sequestered sand sized material in the atchafalaya river was more readily available for transport and more responsive to increases in streamflow in addition there were increases in ssls in the atchafalaya river and decreases in ssls along the lower mississippi river the increases were attributed to resuspension of sand sized sediment in a depositional zone located below the confluence of the red river with the atchafalaya river in contrast diversion of flow through the old river control structure into the atchafalaya reduced stream power and decreased the carrying capacity of the lower mississippi river resulting in a zone of deposition between tarbert landing and st francisville and a loss of ssl as water moved downstream the ssc q relationship also varies among years fig 4 at ms stfr the ssc q relationships indicate higher sscs in 1980 about 180 400 mg l compared to 2005 or 2015 about 50 200 mg l across all flows and months the decreases in ssc between 1980 and 2005 occurred across the entire range of flow i e larger decreases in ssc at low or high flows are generally not observed and across the entire year between 2005 and 2015 decreases in ssc also appeared to occur across the entire range of flow except for a lower magnitude of change during winter and spring months jan may during these months relatively larger decreases are seen during higher flows suggesting most of the observed changes in annual ssc and ssl are coming from decreases in suspended sediment during elevated flows at ac melv the scc q relationships also typically indicate higher sscs in 1980 about 80 400 mg l compared to 2005 about 50 375 mg l or 2015 about 50 275 mg l for most ranges of flow and times of year decreases in ssc between 1980 and 2005 were larger at higher flows during the summer and fall july november but during the winter and spring january may decreases in ssc were larger at low flows fig 4 decreases in ssc between 2005 and 2015 occurred primarily at moderate and high flow during the winter and spring december may thus in the atchafalaya river decreases in annual ssc and ssl appear to be driven by a combination of decreases in ssc at low and high flows depending on the time of year whereas the more recent decreases appear to have occurred mostly due to decreases in ssc during high flows in the winter and spring 4 4 implications for coastal restoration our estimated current suspended sediment load to the lower mississippi atchafalaya delta complex was about 100 mt year in 2015 in contrast to estimated future loads to the delta of 200 mt year or more table 2 based on historical periods when ssls and sscs were higher than present table 1 for example one series of studies obtained an average ssl for both rivers of 208 210 mt y kim et al 2008 kim et al 2009 kenney et al 2013 bentley et al 2014 by combining the average ssl of 84 mt y from 1952 to 1989 in the atchafalaya river allison et al 2000 with the average ssl of about 125 mt y from 1981 to 1992 in the mississippi river horowitz 2006 the studies that predict or assume future loads of around 200 mt year are more consistent with historical data from earlier periods when suspended sediment concentration and loads were higher blum and roberts 2009 2012 khalil and freeman 2015 the success of restoration projects will depend directly on available sediment blum and roberts 2009 2012 bentley et al 2014 the use of an overestimated source term in sediment budgets for coastal restoration will result in overestimates of the amount of sediment available for diversions and the amounts actually diverted sediment loads probably have not increased over the past 10 years 2005 2015 and considering the persistence of factors driving declines ssc and ssl are likely to stabilize or continue to decrease but not increase table 4 sediment deposition between upstream sites e g st francisville melville and potential restoration sites in the lowermost portions of the rivers is important and needs to be considered as part of future restoration efforts typical ssc and ssl trend results from other studies many based on data collected upstream from this study were uniformly higher in comparison tables 1 and 2 for example historical concentrations and loads have been higher at tarbert landing compared to st francisville but allison and meselhe 2010 have documented a depositional area between the two locations in the mississippi river allison et al 2012 showed minimal ssl loss from st francisville 90 3 mt yr to belle chasse 88 3 mt yr thus supporting the use of st francisville from this study for ssc and ssl estimates for downstream restoration planning in addition any flood plain deposition smith and bentley 2014 and in stream accretion of sediment occurring upstream is accounted for by using the downstream st francisville location similarly the use of the melville location along the atchafalaya river serves the same purpose in this study historically through 2010 loads at melville ranged from 12 2 to 96 7 mt yr and the combined loads from wax lake outlet and morgan city ranged from 16 4 to 115 9 mt yr welch et al 2014 were similar hysteresis pulse and similar event scale complexities are not identifiable in wrtds monthly results continuous monitoring and more detailed modeling will be needed to understand predict and manage sediment pulses peyronnin et al 2016 the timing and sources of suspended sediment are variable and complex mossa 1988 1996 allison et al 2014 and a strong hysteresis in the relation of ssc to streamflow indicates that sediment transport is supply limited horowitz 2010 meade and moody 2010 because of the strong hysteresis in ssc the best time to divert suspended sediment for coastal restoration is the brief period of high ssc in the rising limb of floods most of the diverted ssc would be from winter and spring floods snedden et al 2007 thorne et al 2008 xu and rosen 2012 allison et al 2014 peyronnin et al 2016 seasonal patterns between ssc and streamflow fig 4 determined in this study show differences between ms stfr and ac melv which may influence approaches and timing of sediment diversions to promote restoration for example recent 2005 2015 streamflow at ms stfr typically provides a ssc of no more than 200 mg l less than that at the highest flows making it necessary to focus diversion on relatively brief periods of high ssc and rising streamflow in contrast ssc increases with increasing streamflow conditions at ac melv and winter flood peaks may offer opportunities to capture sediment efficiently contour plots of both sites figs s5 and s6 showing the evolving pattern of expected concentration values as a function of time and streamflow are included in the supplementary material 5 conclusions the use of wrtds modeling to analyze suspended sediment data from the mississippi river near st francisville and the atchafalaya river at melville identified decreasing trends in suspended sediment concentration ssc and load ssl since 1980 similar to several previous studies in the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers flow normalized ssc in the lowermost mississippi and atchafalaya rivers decreased by about half from 1980 through 2015 from about 260 mg l early in this period to about 130 mg l declines in ssc and ssl from 2005 to 2015 are more gradual than the earlier decline the combined load of the two rivers in 1980 was close to 200 mt y which is about the value that some planned sediment diversions are based on however the present 2015 load is closer to 100 mt y future ssc and ssl in both rivers are uncertain historic declines have slowed and may stop there is little evidence based on identified drivers of trends to suggest that suspended sediment will increase in the near future and stabilization or slow declines in ssc and ssl appear more plausible these recent ssc and ssl estimates from this study using the wrtds model which accounts for uncertainly in suspended sediment concentrations associated with flow conditions are useful estimates for restoration purposes seasonal differences in the response of ssc to streamflow between the atchafalaya river and lower mississippi river are substantial enough that downstream sediment based restoration efforts are unlikely to be fully successful without taking these

7048,the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model was used to derive estimates of suspended sediment concentration ssc and suspended sediment load ssl their dependence on discharge and their trends with confidence intervals for one site each on the lowermost mississippi and atchafalaya rivers the wrtds model reduces uncertainty in sscs related to variable streamflow conditions flow normalized sscs in each river were similar and decreased from about 260 mg l to 130 mg l from 1980 through 2015 combined annual ssl in the two rivers decreased from about 200 megatons per year mt y to about 100 mt y declines in ssc and ssl were more gradual from 2005 through 2015 and show signs of stabilizing our estimates of ssl in 2015 differ markedly from several recently published estimates of current and projected future mississippi river ssls which were generally around 200 mt y however these values came mostly from a different site upstream on the mississippi river the relationship between ssc and streamflow differed in an important way between the two rivers ssc increased as streamflow increased for the entire range of observed streamflow in the atchafalaya river in the mississippi river ssc followed the same pattern during low and moderate streamflow but decreased at the highest streamflow that tended to occur between january and july since much of the water flowing in the atchafalaya originates from the mississippi river the difference suggests a within basin source of suspended sediment for the atchafalaya river that is absent in the lower mississippi river these findings have important implications for the restoration of deltaic wetlands in coastal louisiana accurate estimates of the ssl available in each river are crucial for understanding how effective diversions of river water into adjacent estuaries will be in sustaining these wetlands our study demonstrates that there might be far less sediment available than previously reported further the difference in the relationship between ssc and streamflow in the two rivers is highly relevant to the ongoing discussion of coastal restoration strategies because the delta building that is occurring at the mouth of the atchafalaya river is frequently used as a model of what could be expected with controlled diversions in the lower mississippi river delta the differences in the ssc behavior with changes in streamflow between the two rivers needs to be considered when results from the atchafalaya river system are projected to those of the mississippi river keywords water quality wrtds trend analysis coastal restoration 1 introduction sediment transported by the lower mississippi and atchafalaya rivers is crucial to the sustainability of coastal louisiana wetlands including those of the delta plain blum and roberts 2012 khalil et al 2010 bentley et al 2014 groves et al 2016 the majority of the sediment delivered to the coast is derived from the contiguous united states and its estimated magnitude and recent trends are variable while the need for a well defined sediment budget for the mississippi atchafalaya delta has long been recognized kesel et al 1992 gramling et al 2006 khalil et al 2010 allison and meselhe 2010 allison et al 2012 a consensus on the sediment source term for this budget is uncertain the hydrography of the lower mississippi atchafalaya river basin is complex as the mississippi river enters its distributary system a portion of the river is diverted west through the old river control structure and converges with the red river to form the atchafalaya river fig 1 both river basins consist of a system of distributary channels complicated by artificial levees and floodways typically overall flow and sediment transport into the delta is estimated as the sum from the lower mississippi and atchafalaya rivers two locations along each river have been used in previous studies to determine loads to the delta on the mississippi river these locations are tarbert landing or st francisville located 14 km 9 mi and 18 km 53 mi downstream from the old river control structure respectively on the atchafalaya river these locations are simmesport or melville located 8 km 5 mi and 48 km 30 mi downstream from the river s origin at the confluence of the old river diversion with the red river fig 1 the combined sediment load of the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers represents the ultimate source term for the complex poorly defined sediment budget delivered downstream the existence of an adequate sediment source is critical for the success of diversions constructed to deliver sediment to louisiana coastal marshes the adequacy of the current sediment supply for the success of proposed diversions is uncertain maulhardt 2015 to help guide the maintenance and restoration of coastal louisiana wetlands the current sediment source term as well as the most recent trajectories need to be clearly defined diversions without a high ssc may not be able to raise the ground level through deposition fast enough to keep pace with relative sea level rise snedden et al 2007 furthermore the 2012 louisiana master plan coastal protection and restoration authority 2012 discusses the possibility of changes in river streamflow and associated sediment load but does not discuss ssc or quantify ssls as knopman et al 2014 stated the framework explicitly dealt with uncertainties in sea level rise subsidence storm frequency and intensity economic development and the fragility of engineered protective structures but it does not deal with uncertainty in ssc or ssl entering the delta the rates and magnitudes of changes in ssc and ssl differ substantially depending on the study period method of trend analysis and which river and site are considered tables 1 and 2 to determine current values and recent trends of ssc and ssl entering coastal louisiana through the combined mississippi atchafalaya rivers we used the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model wrtds exhibits better estimation accuracy and lower bias in comparison to other load estimation methods and allows for more flexibility in the relationship between concentration and flow conditions moyer et al 2012 hirsch 2014 lee et al 2016 chanat et al 2016 our results are based on the most downstream station on each river that have sufficient long term record and represent the most up to date concentration and loads being delivered to the delta complex we also used the model to explore the seasonal variability of relations between ssc and streamflow over time finally we discuss the implication of these results to coastal wetland restoration in the gulf of mexico these analyses and considerations are crucial to guiding restoration efforts of coastal louisiana wetlands optimally 1 1 previous studies previous studies in the lower mississippi and atchafalaya rivers document declines in sediment loads since the 1920s kesel 2003 jacobson et al 2009 alexander et al 2012 in the mississippi river five studies found downward trends in ssl ranging from 0 33 to 0 84 percent per year at tarbert landing and two studies found declines from 1 8 to 4 4 percent per year at st francisville for trend years beginning between 1959 and 1994 and ending between 1978 and 2009 table 1 fig s1 two studies detected a gently increasing recent trend horowitz 2010 xu and rosen 2012 rosen 2013 and two other studies found no trend keown et al 1986 little and biedenharn 2014 also the studies that investigated trends in ssc typically found decreases similar to those in ssl in general estimates of ssl typically the ssl of the reported trend end year are higher at tarbert landing ranging from 109 to 161 megatons per year mt y compared to st francisville where the two studies conducted there report 87 and 91 mt year table 1 substantial differences in ssc and ssl between the two long term monitoring stations at tarbert landing and simmesport and the corresponding downstream stations of st francisville and melville respectively have been observed allison and meselhe 2010 the differences may be due to differing sample techniques and analysis differences in sample collection depths and depositional areas located between the two sites on each river fewer studies have addressed changes in ssc or ssl in the atchafalaya river two studies were conducted at simmesport and found ssls of 49 and 94 mt year table 1 fig s2 keown et al 1986 blum and roberts 2009 at melville rebich and demcheck 2007 estimated decreasing trends of 4 6 percent per year in ssl but no trend in ssc over the ten year period from 1993 to 2004 estimates of annual ssc and ssl for 2004 were 211 mg l and 44 mt y respectively a few previous studies also calculated estimates of total suspended sediment load entering the combined lower mississippi atchafalaya deltas table 2 fig s3 these estimates are calculated as the sum of annual ssls from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers reported here as the estimates from trend end years or as an assumed future load depending on the study reported trend end year estimates range from 255 mt year of suspended sediment entering the delta in 1978 keown et al 1986 to lower recent estimates of 131 in 2004 and 167 mt year in 2006 by rebich and demcheck 2007 and blum and roberts 2009 respectively 2 methods for the wrtds analyses we used ssc data collected from the mississippi river near st francisville louisiana ms stfr and from the atchafalaya river at melville louisiana ac melv fig 1 ssc data were collected by the u s geological survey usgs mostly as part of the national water stream quality accounting network nasqan and national water quality network nwqn programs from as early as 1979 through 2015 ssc samples were collected using isokinetic depth integrated sampling techniques described in the usgs national field manual for the collection of water quality data usgs variously dated ssc data were retrieved from the usgs national water information system u s geological survey 2016 streamflow data were not available at either water quality site instead we used daily computed streamflow at tarbert landing u s army corps of engineers 2016a for ms stfr and daily computed streamflow at simmesport u s army corps of engineers 2016b for ac melv table 3 data used for trend analysis were screened according to the following criteria 1 a site must have a minimum of bimonthly results 6 ssc samples each year 2 at least 10 years of continuous streamflow record with no more than 2 consecutive years without data and 3 suspended sediment samples collected across a range of streamflow conditions and across all seasons wrtds was selected to estimate annual mean ssc and total ssl at ms stfr and ac melv this model has been extensively described in hirsch et al 2010 hirsch and de cicco 2015 and hirsch et al 2015 but a brief overview is provided here the wrtds analysis was completed using the exploration and graphics for river trends egret r package hirsch et al 2015 version 2 6 0 wrtds models concentration as a function of time flow and seasonal components 1 ln c β 0 β 1 t β 2 ln q β 3 sin 2 π t β 4 cos 2 π t ε where ln is the natural log c is suspended sediment concentration βn are fitted coefficients t is time q is mean daily discharge and ε is unexplained variability wrtds fits this model at about 8000 nodes across a discharge time grid estimates of daily concentrations are computed by bilinear interpolation of the values on this grid e g fig s3 daily mean discharge values at each site are gridded by 14 equidistant values in log space and time is gridded at 1 16th of a year at each of these nodes equation 1 is fit using locally weighted regression specifically a weighted tobit model at each calibration node the observations in the dataset are weighted according to their similarity to the calibration point in terms of time season time of year and discharge weights for the observations in the calibration dataset are assigned using a tricube weight function according to distance in time distance in season fractional portion of the year and distance in discharge relative to the conditions at the calibration point the half window widths used for these variables in our study were 7 years for time and 0 5 year for season for both sites and 1 and 2 natural log discharge units for discharge at ms stfr and ac melv respectively the discharge window was narrowed for ms stfr to better capture the downturn of the concentration discharge relationship at high flows at this site the half window width for time was allowed to become larger near the beginning and end of the record so that there were always 14 years of data being used in model calibration for each node in the time discharge grid the individually calibrated models are used to estimate concentration each model gives the natural log of concentration which is exponentiated and multiplied by a bias correction factor to give the estimated concentration in milligrams per liter mg l of suspended sediment the bias correction factor is also specific to each node and is computed using the standard error daily estimates are then derived using bilinear interpolation of the estimates at the nodes load is then computed for each day using the daily mean discharge for the day using the above method expected values of concentration can be determined for all possible combinations of discharge season and time in the given dataset and provide a useful means of characterizing the behavior of concentration as a function of these variables these estimates of the expected value of concentration are often displayed across a discharge time grid for each site fig s3 in supplementary material these expected values were used to explore changes over time in concentration discharge relationships during particular times of the year expected values of concentration were summarized to monthly means at given discharge magnitudes and plotted for specified months and years in many rivers including the two sites used in this study concentration and load are influenced by streamflow and streamflow driven variability in concentration and load estimates can obscure the overall trends in water quality at a site even though annual mean streamflow showed no significant changes during 1980 through 2015 fig s4 at ms stfr mann kendall media slope 14 m3 s yr p 0 84 or ac melv mann kendall media slope 7 m3 s yr p 0 80 wrtds uses flow normalization to account for the variability of concentration or load estimates due to random year to year variation in streamflow specifically for each calendar day n 365 a probability distribution of daily discharge is compiled from the observed daily discharge record for the sites used in our study the period of record is from 1980 through 2015 so each calendar day would have 36 daily flows values one from each year in the period of record then for each day in the period of record the calibrated models are run using each of the 36 daily flow values for the given calendar day and the average of these 36 concentration estimates is the flow normalized fn concentration for that day for example a fn concentration estimate for july 15 2000 would use 36 daily flow values for july 15th across the period of record estimates for each combination of these 36 flow values and the july 15 2000 date would be determined from interpolation from the grid of values described above the fn concentration estimate for this date would use the average of these 36 concentration values the fn load estimate for this date would be computed in the same manner except that the concentration values are each multiplied by streamflow and a conversion factor the fn load estimate for this date is the average of these 36 load values the method allows the estimated trends when expressed as a percentage change to be different for concentration and load like estimates of concentration and load fn estimates of concentration and load are averaged or summed over the year to give annual estimates fn estimates show less variability than standard estimates because fn estimates represent the behavior of concentration and load with the year to year variations in flow reduced the trends reported in this analysis are the difference in fn concentration or load between the first and last years of a given trend period wrtds was originally developed as an exploratory data analysis tool and recently a bootstrap method has extended the application of wrtds to characterize the uncertainty of annual estimates and trends a thorough presentation of this methodology referred to as the wrtds bootstrap test wbt is presented in hirsch et al 2015 and briefly summarized here bootstrap replicates were developed using a time based resampling approach where predefined blocks of consecutive days were randomly drawn with replacement from the period of record samples were drawn until the number of samples in the bootstrap replicate equaled the number of samples in the observed dataset for this analysis we used a block length of 200 days and 100 bootstrap replicates at each site each bootstrap replicate was run using the standard wrtds analysis after which all the annual estimates of fn concentration and fn load along with the trends calculated between two specified years were retained these trend estimates are used to determine the 90 confidence intervals of the annual values and trend also this information provides an estimate of how likely the given trend is likelihood and a statistic that is functionally equivalent to a p value hirsch et al 2015 encouraged the use of a specified terminology to describe the uncertainty results from the wbt this language is similar to the terminology used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and is based on the likelihood of the magnitude and direction of the trend hirsch et al 2015 the likelihood values are the number of upward or downward trends relative to all the bootstrap runs we describe the trends presented here using this language table 2 of hirsch et al 2015 the uncertainty analysis was preformed using the egret confidence intervals ci r package version 1 0 3 hirsch et al 2015 the input and output data files for the wrtds model used in the study are available from murphy and mize 2018 3 results the temporal patterns of annual ssc and ssl estimates are generally similar between sites on the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers symbols connected by dotted lines in fig 2 in the 1980s the flow normalized ssc trends exceeded the mean concentration 260 mg l in both rivers ssc trends converged in the 1990s and appear to be relatively level at about 130 mg l since 2005 fig 2 murphy and mize 2018 annual mean sscs at ms stfr and ac melv have a similar range of values except for a period between 1983 and 1994 during this period sscs at ac melv were considerably higher and showed a different temporal pattern than the concentrations at ms stfr interestingly during 1987 and 1988 the entire mississippi river watershed experienced extreme drought conditions lins and slack 1999 that may correspond to the observed lower concentrations in both rivers compared to the surrounding years after 1995 the annual ssc and ssl at the two sites were very highly associated with each other fig 2 flow normalized ssc fn ssc and load fn ssl decreased from 1980 through 2015 solid line in fig 2 the largest decreases occurred prior to the late 2000s fn ssc decreased by about 50 percent in both rivers from 1980 to 2015 but only decreased by 6 and 11 percent from 2005 to 2015 at ms stfr and ac melv respectively table 4 over the same 1980 2015 trend period fn ssl decreased by 51 percent at ms stfr from about 137 to 67 mt y and 43 percent at ac melv from about 58 to 33 mt y more recent declines in fn ssl 2005 2015 are slightly larger in the atchafalaya river 16 compared to the mississippi river 11 table 4 in general the patterns of fn ssc and fn ssl estimates over time are similar between the sites except for the increase then decrease of ssc and ssl between 1980 and 1992 in the atchafalaya river from 1980 to the peak in 1985 fn ssc increased by about 10 percent and fn ssl increased by about 17 fig 2 the overall decreasing trends of sscs and ssls at both sites agree with some previous studies allison and meselhe 2010 rebich and demcheck 2007 table 1 completed in these rivers but clearly disagree with others keown et al 1986 xu and rosen 2012 rosen 2013 little and biedenharn 2014 table 1 4 discussion 4 1 decreasing suspended sediment the drivers of the large historical declines in ssc and ssl in the mississippi river include channel improvements reservoir construction and soil conservation practices keown et al 1986 meade and moody 2010 tweel and turner 2012 the most intensive period of dam construction and channel alteration cutoffs revetments and dikes on the mississippi and its major tributaries ran from the 1920s through the 1960s with construction at a slower pace in the 1970s kesel 2003 jacobson et al 2009 alexander et al 2012 during this entire period direct effects of major modifications caused a large decrease in sediment load and channels continued to respond geomorphically after construction was largely completed smith and winkley 1996 kesel 2003 on the red river a major contributor of sediment to the atchafalaya construction of a lock and dam system continued until 1994 pinkard and stewart 2001 red river waterway commission 2016 after 1994 ssl and ssc in the atchafalaya appear to have declined abruptly and thereafter their trends resemble those in the mississippi fig 2 the increased implementation of soil conservation practices reduced the amount of sediment leaving agricultural lands throughout the smaller contributing basins knox 1987 alexander et al 2012 effects of soil conservation and channel stabilization in the entire mississippi river basin are highly variable ranging from negligible to large decreases in sediment yield myers et al 2000 pinkard and stewart 2001 garbrecht and starks 2009 neal 2014 u s department of agriculture conservation effects assessment project ceap 2013 assessments indicate that soil conservation has reduced annual ssl delivered to the gulf of mexico from the mississippi atchafalaya system by 4 relative to the no soil conservation case and that implementing conservation in undertreated acres would reduce ssl another 5 most analyses of ssls from the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers have detected a recent decreasing trend since 2005 the declines in ssl have slowed apparently due to the geomorphic evolution of large navigable river channels toward stability changes in land use meade and moody 2010 morang et al 2013 and possibly commercial dredging alexander et al 2012 current sources of sediment in the mississippi are about 25 from channel degradation and 75 from upland erosion white et al 2014 in general sand loads are stable and changes in loads are driven by changing concentrations of silt and clay biedenharn et al 2000 heimann et al 2011 according to nittrouer and viparelli 2014 sand stored in river channels will be a stable long term source of sediment that can be transported in higher streamflow events but this source may be sensitive to the sand supply and the amount of sand in storage allison et al 2012 based on the recognized drivers of ssc and ssl the declining trends are unlikely to be reversed existing dams and channel improvements will likely be preserved for the sake of their navigation and flood control benefits strategies for reversing the declining trend in ssl include bypassing clogged dams bentley et al 2012 but this approach could be as costly as the dams themselves were to construct kemp et al 2016 values ascribed to soil conservation myers et al 2000 garbrecht and starks 2009 neal 2014 ceap 2013 suggest that it will continue to be promoted 4 2 uncertainty of decreasing trends there is a high amount of confidence in the finding of decreasing ssc and ssl from 1980 to 2015 in both rivers most of the histogram for the 1980 2015 trends for ssc and ssl at ms stfr and ac melv plot to the far left tail of the distributions typically with trend estimates ranging between 60 and 20 percent depending on the site fig 3 these 36 year trends are considered highly likely with likelihoods ranging from 0 995 to 0 965 table 4 the shorter more recent 2005 2015 trends are considered very likely with likelihoods range from 0 916 to 0 946 table 4 the density histograms for the 2005 2015 trends extend into positive percent changes on the right tail of these distributions fig 3 thus we are less confident in these most recent declines of ssc and ssl compared to the 1980 2015 trends also the p values associated with these more recent trends are typically 0 10 and in a strict null hypothesis testing approach using a significance level of 0 05 would be considered not significant however the density histograms show that a majority of the bootstrapped runs returned negative percent changes and only the upper tail of the distribution crosses into positive values and indicate that decreases in ssc and ssl between 2005 and 2015 are more likely to have occurred than not a standard non significant result for this trend period would be far less informative a close inspection of fn ssc and fn ssl over time suggests decreases from 2005 to 2008 and then minimally varying fn ssc and fn ssl through 2015 fig 2 this pattern is also reflected in the 90 percent confidence intervals however the 90 percent confidence interval envelope displays the range of concentrations and loads and does appear to allow several scenarios for this most recent 11 year period consistent decreases through the period appear possible for ssc and ssl at ms stfr and ssc at ac melv however the 90 percent confidence interval for ssl at ac melv appears to bend and narrow around 2009 restricting the possible scenarios and suggesting a leveling off of decreasing ssl during this period fig 2b 4 3 seasonal changes in suspended sediment the relationship between ssc and streamflow ssc q varies seasonally and between each site on the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers fig 4 at both sites ssc increases with increasing streamflow however at ms stfr this relationship changes at the highest flows which normally occur winter through summer january july similar to findings by mossa 1996 and welch et al 2014 during these times of year and at the highest flows flow magnitudes in this study near 20 000 m3 s sscs are diluted with continued increases in streamflow this reversal in the ssc q relationship is not present at ac melv instead ssc increases with increasing streamflow during all seasons since the dominant source of water to both rivers is the upper mississippi river increases in ssc related to higher streamflow that occur in the atchafalaya but not in the mississippi indicate an in stream sediment source within the atchafalaya basin that may contribute to the ssc during these scouring events during the 2011 flood in the lower mississippi atchafalaya river basin welch et al 2014 noted that sequestered sand sized material in the atchafalaya river was more readily available for transport and more responsive to increases in streamflow in addition there were increases in ssls in the atchafalaya river and decreases in ssls along the lower mississippi river the increases were attributed to resuspension of sand sized sediment in a depositional zone located below the confluence of the red river with the atchafalaya river in contrast diversion of flow through the old river control structure into the atchafalaya reduced stream power and decreased the carrying capacity of the lower mississippi river resulting in a zone of deposition between tarbert landing and st francisville and a loss of ssl as water moved downstream the ssc q relationship also varies among years fig 4 at ms stfr the ssc q relationships indicate higher sscs in 1980 about 180 400 mg l compared to 2005 or 2015 about 50 200 mg l across all flows and months the decreases in ssc between 1980 and 2005 occurred across the entire range of flow i e larger decreases in ssc at low or high flows are generally not observed and across the entire year between 2005 and 2015 decreases in ssc also appeared to occur across the entire range of flow except for a lower magnitude of change during winter and spring months jan may during these months relatively larger decreases are seen during higher flows suggesting most of the observed changes in annual ssc and ssl are coming from decreases in suspended sediment during elevated flows at ac melv the scc q relationships also typically indicate higher sscs in 1980 about 80 400 mg l compared to 2005 about 50 375 mg l or 2015 about 50 275 mg l for most ranges of flow and times of year decreases in ssc between 1980 and 2005 were larger at higher flows during the summer and fall july november but during the winter and spring january may decreases in ssc were larger at low flows fig 4 decreases in ssc between 2005 and 2015 occurred primarily at moderate and high flow during the winter and spring december may thus in the atchafalaya river decreases in annual ssc and ssl appear to be driven by a combination of decreases in ssc at low and high flows depending on the time of year whereas the more recent decreases appear to have occurred mostly due to decreases in ssc during high flows in the winter and spring 4 4 implications for coastal restoration our estimated current suspended sediment load to the lower mississippi atchafalaya delta complex was about 100 mt year in 2015 in contrast to estimated future loads to the delta of 200 mt year or more table 2 based on historical periods when ssls and sscs were higher than present table 1 for example one series of studies obtained an average ssl for both rivers of 208 210 mt y kim et al 2008 kim et al 2009 kenney et al 2013 bentley et al 2014 by combining the average ssl of 84 mt y from 1952 to 1989 in the atchafalaya river allison et al 2000 with the average ssl of about 125 mt y from 1981 to 1992 in the mississippi river horowitz 2006 the studies that predict or assume future loads of around 200 mt year are more consistent with historical data from earlier periods when suspended sediment concentration and loads were higher blum and roberts 2009 2012 khalil and freeman 2015 the success of restoration projects will depend directly on available sediment blum and roberts 2009 2012 bentley et al 2014 the use of an overestimated source term in sediment budgets for coastal restoration will result in overestimates of the amount of sediment available for diversions and the amounts actually diverted sediment loads probably have not increased over the past 10 years 2005 2015 and considering the persistence of factors driving declines ssc and ssl are likely to stabilize or continue to decrease but not increase table 4 sediment deposition between upstream sites e g st francisville melville and potential restoration sites in the lowermost portions of the rivers is important and needs to be considered as part of future restoration efforts typical ssc and ssl trend results from other studies many based on data collected upstream from this study were uniformly higher in comparison tables 1 and 2 for example historical concentrations and loads have been higher at tarbert landing compared to st francisville but allison and meselhe 2010 have documented a depositional area between the two locations in the mississippi river allison et al 2012 showed minimal ssl loss from st francisville 90 3 mt yr to belle chasse 88 3 mt yr thus supporting the use of st francisville from this study for ssc and ssl estimates for downstream restoration planning in addition any flood plain deposition smith and bentley 2014 and in stream accretion of sediment occurring upstream is accounted for by using the downstream st francisville location similarly the use of the melville location along the atchafalaya river serves the same purpose in this study historically through 2010 loads at melville ranged from 12 2 to 96 7 mt yr and the combined loads from wax lake outlet and morgan city ranged from 16 4 to 115 9 mt yr welch et al 2014 were similar hysteresis pulse and similar event scale complexities are not identifiable in wrtds monthly results continuous monitoring and more detailed modeling will be needed to understand predict and manage sediment pulses peyronnin et al 2016 the timing and sources of suspended sediment are variable and complex mossa 1988 1996 allison et al 2014 and a strong hysteresis in the relation of ssc to streamflow indicates that sediment transport is supply limited horowitz 2010 meade and moody 2010 because of the strong hysteresis in ssc the best time to divert suspended sediment for coastal restoration is the brief period of high ssc in the rising limb of floods most of the diverted ssc would be from winter and spring floods snedden et al 2007 thorne et al 2008 xu and rosen 2012 allison et al 2014 peyronnin et al 2016 seasonal patterns between ssc and streamflow fig 4 determined in this study show differences between ms stfr and ac melv which may influence approaches and timing of sediment diversions to promote restoration for example recent 2005 2015 streamflow at ms stfr typically provides a ssc of no more than 200 mg l less than that at the highest flows making it necessary to focus diversion on relatively brief periods of high ssc and rising streamflow in contrast ssc increases with increasing streamflow conditions at ac melv and winter flood peaks may offer opportunities to capture sediment efficiently contour plots of both sites figs s5 and s6 showing the evolving pattern of expected concentration values as a function of time and streamflow are included in the supplementary material 5 conclusions the use of wrtds modeling to analyze suspended sediment data from the mississippi river near st francisville and the atchafalaya river at melville identified decreasing trends in suspended sediment concentration ssc and load ssl since 1980 similar to several previous studies in the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers flow normalized ssc in the lowermost mississippi and atchafalaya rivers decreased by about half from 1980 through 2015 from about 260 mg l early in this period to about 130 mg l declines in ssc and ssl from 2005 to 2015 are more gradual than the earlier decline the combined load of the two rivers in 1980 was close to 200 mt y which is about the value that some planned sediment diversions are based on however the present 2015 load is closer to 100 mt y future ssc and ssl in both rivers are uncertain historic declines have slowed and may stop there is little evidence based on identified drivers of trends to suggest that suspended sediment will increase in the near future and stabilization or slow declines in ssc and ssl appear more plausible these recent ssc and ssl estimates from this study using the wrtds model which accounts for uncertainly in suspended sediment concentrations associated with flow conditions are useful estimates for restoration purposes seasonal differences in the response of ssc to streamflow between the atchafalaya river and lower mississippi river are substantial enough that downstream sediment based restoration efforts are unlikely to be fully successful without taking these

7049,downscaling is the process by which output from global climate models is translated to finer resolution regional scale projections often used in impact studies many fundamentally different techniques can be used each with different capabilities of resolving or representing sub gridscale processes the different formulations can lead to variations in the downscaled output with consequential impacts in the interpretation of future change here future runoff is estimated for six catchments in the australian state of victoria using five different regional rainfall projection products we investigate how differences in rainfall input manifest in a selection of regionally important hydroclimate metrics overall annual runoff is projected to decline under most methods but seasonal changes are more uncertain reflecting differences in the rainfall change signal for different downscaled products whilst change in flow metrics are mostly consistent with rainfall change factors changes in low flow e g 7 day minimum flow show considerable uncertainty especially for drier ephemeral catchments results from empirical simple scaling of climate observations generally lie within the range of more complex downscaling methods however empirical scaling is unable to provide meaningful information on spatial heterogeneity in the change signals as well as for several metrics of rainfall and runoff other downscaling methods can potentially provide information on these but the large uncertainty remains a problem as well as our currently poor understanding of method related biases keywords downscaling hydroclimate projections climate change runoff victoria australia 1 introduction planning for the future is an integral part of managing water resources poff et al 2016 even more so in regions with large natural variability and periodically scarce supply such are the conditions in southeast australia where long term trends show an ongoing decline of cool season april to october rainfall since the early 1990s hope et al 2016 since the cool season is the filling season for regional reservoirs in southeast australia there is concern among water users that the observed decline may continue into future decades potter and chiew 2009 2011 potter et al 2011 the current national climate projections for the region suggest high confidence in drying in southern australia particularly in spring september to november as a response to shifts in westerlies and strengthening of the subtropical ridge csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 these findings further enhance concern for future water supply in the region to provide meaningful information for water resource impact assessments the coarse spatial signal from global climate models gcms needs to be downscaled to finer resolution scales i e point or catchment scale because downscaling methods vary in technical formulation and complexity for some variables and regions downscaling methods can produce very different results many downscaling comparisons have been conducted to demonstrate and understand the plausible range of projections in downscaling ensembles see e g fowler et al 2007 chiew et al 2010 chen et al 2011 frost et al 2011 grose et al 2015 sunyer et al 2015 the state government of victoria australia provides guidance about future change to runoff for water corporations catchment management authorities and industries to manage and plan for long term risks to water supply delwp 2016 guidance for a 50 year time horizon is contained in the state s water supply and demand wsd plans a document that is revised every 5 years the most recent hydroclimate projections supporting the wsd planning considered both gcm projected change and observed decadal variability the gcm based projections used climate change information from 42 models from the fifth climate model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 downscaled to the region using a change factor approach potter et al 2016 however as recently shown by ekström et al 2016 there is emerging evidence of a regional change signal in available downscaling products that is not reflected in gcm based projections for southeast australia the nature of this change signal differs between different downscaling products making it difficult for users of these datasets to assess their relative value in comparison to the gcm based projections if using climate change projections for policy guidance researchers need to carefully consider the choice of methods used and sources of information of primary importance is the representation of key sources of uncertainty in global climate change information and secondly ensuring that the method or methods used to derive a regional resolved projection have the capacity to translate the aspect of change relevant to the application e g to spell duration or extremes the key sources of uncertainty are found in 1 the emission scenarios used for the global climate modelling uncertainties about the species and rate of greenhouse gas ghg emissions 2 the models used to simulate the climate response to the changing ghg emissions aspects of model structure and parameter schemes that influence the models ability to simulate the climate and 3 natural climate variability the ability of the model to simulate the full range variability in the climate not arising from emission forcing to attempt to represent these sources of uncertainty researchers can consider gcm output using a range of emission scenarios such as the representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 and consider the use of a large number of gcms to sample model ability to simulate forced and internal climate variability each additional manipulation of data adds some level of uncertainty to the outcomes such as the downscaling step and the impact modelling itself for example many hydrological models are conceptual models relying on a robust calibration to provide good estimates of streamflow under changing climate conditions these assumptions may no longer hold this challenge is often referred to as the non stationarity problem discussed at length by several authors milly et al 2008 potter et al 2013 saft et al 2016 chiew et al 2017 an additional concern for projections is the choice of baseline period this is the choice of time window for which the future data is compared and represents the future climate see e g timbal et al 2016 potter et al 2016 further details on the production of climate change datasets and the impact on policy guidance is detailed in harris et al 2014 and ekström et al 2016 in this study we examine rainfall from the five different downscaled datasets that are currently available for six representative catchments in the state of victoria the aim is to quantify differences in rainfall projections by different available downscaled climate change datasets and further examine how such differences manifest in metrics derived from streamflow modelled using the different downscaled datasets the ensemble of datasets is an ensemble of opportunity representing all downscaled datasets available for the region in 2017 because of the opportunistic nature of this ensemble there is some variation in the use of emission scenario cmip archive and slight difference in time horizons however all selected projections have the common purpose of illustrating regional climate change for a far future time horizon under a high emission scenario and the ensemble represents the current information available to researchers planners and purveyors of climate change information section 2 outlines the downscaling methods climate data and hydrological modelling used in this study section 3 presents changes in mean annual and seasonal rainfall across victoria annual and seasonal runoff for six study catchments and changes in key rainfall and runoff metrics as well as the differing spatial resolution of the different downscaling methods and the potential for providing within catchment climate information section 4 discusses limitations of the study and directions for future research and section 5 gives conclusions and recommendations 2 data and methods 2 1 downscaled rainfall datasets there are many fundamentally different approaches used to achieve a finer resolved climate projection it is well established that different methods can influence what aspects of the gcm change signal are translated to the finer resolved downscaled data set e g fowler et al 2007 chen et al 2011 ekström et al 2015 briefly downscaling methods can be categorised as 1 empirical downscaling or change factor methods which apply projected changes in the distribution of gcm rainfall to observed point or catchment scale climate data 2 statistical downscaling methods which use statistical relationships based on observed data and apply these on gcm output to derive a local variable estimate and 3 dynamical downscaling methods typically involving regional climate models rcms that simulate physical processes at a finer spatial scale using boundary conditions from a host gcm this study considers all currently available downscaled datasets in south eastern australia with output that is readily available for hydrological modelling table 1 the datasets are produced by different research initiatives across the region the victorian climate initiative hope et al 2016 and its predecessor the south eastern australian climate initiative csiro 2012 the new south wales and australian capital territory regional climate modelling narclim project evans et al 2014a and two datasets created to support the national climate projections csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 the methods used to create these datasets are fundamentally different ranging from empirical scaling to dynamical downscaling furthermore there are some differences in the projected time horizon gcm selection and emission scenario used table 1 table 2 provides a full list of the gcms downscaled by each method mean annual regional rainfall for twenty year climate baselines are within 2 of the 20th century annual average potter et al 2016 and the historical time periods are consistent with current recommendations for choosing baseline climate periods for southeast australia timbal et al 2016 while acknowledging differences among datasets we use these datasets in a comparative study to demonstrate the range in streamflow projections for a far future period under a high emission scenario note that for consistency we use historical potential evapotranspiration for the hydrological modelling as described in section 2 2 each dataset is described below it is important to note that precipitation data from the two dynamical downscaling methods wrf and ccam were bias corrected as described in sections 2 1 4 and 2 1 5 we did not bias correct the statistical methods nhmm and sdm since these methods have already been constrained to observed rainfall gauges in the region that is we consider the data processing methods used by the statistical methods sufficient for hydrological modelling without further post processing in contrast the dynamical methods are designed to represent the regional climate dynamics holistically as such precipitation is not explicitly constrained to observations with the result that dynamical methods typically produce biases in rainfall occurrences and amounts teutschbein and seibert 2010 necessitating bias correction before hydrological modelling 2 1 1 empirical scaling empirical scaling has been recommended for use in regional water availability studies frost et al 2011 and underpins recent runoff projections for south eastern australia csiro 2008 chiew et al 2009 post et al 2012 and victoria potter et al 2016 the premise of empirical scaling is that climate information from gcms particularly rainfall is not directly usable in hydrological models since the distribution of gcm rainfall is different from the observed catchment scale daily rainfall distribution however empirical scaling assumes that gcms have sufficient skill to reasonably model future changes in the annual and seasonal rainfall averages these annual and seasonal change factors are then extracted from the gcm historical and future runs and applied to observed catchment or station rainfall and potential evapotranspiration time series empirical scaling therefore relies directly on the observed climate time series and does not consider potential changes in rainfall occurrences and sequences and other finer scale temporal variability the observational datasets used here are the gridded daily rainfall and temperature observations of the australian water availability project awap jones et al 2009 the same gridded datasets were used for empirical scaling to inform the most recent production of regional streamflow projections for victoria potter et al 2016 more details on these data can be found in section 2 2 here scaling uses seasonal and annual scaling factors from 42 cmip5 gcms annual and seasonal means are calculated for the historical and future time periods table 1 for each gcm seasonal change factors are used to scale daily rainfall in each season individually and the annual change factor is used to scale the seasonally scaled rainfall time series to preserve the annual change in gcm rainfall 2 1 2 the statistical downscaling model the statistical downscaling model sdm timbal et al 2009 2011 was one of two downscaling methods used to complement the otherwise gcm based national climate projections by csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 the second being the dynamical downscaling output by ccam see section 2 1 4 the sdm method seeks meteorological analogues of future atmospheric variables from the historical data to develop future rainfall projections relating observed rainfall and temperature to reanalysis atmospheric predictors mean sea level pressure temperature rainfall humidity and wind speeds these statistical relationships are then used with future gcm projections of atmospheric predictors including rainfall to produce future time series of rainfall and maximum temperature the sdm was applied to 22 cmip5 models see table 2 which were those gcms with the necessary output variables required for the method to produce daily and monthly climate time series across victoria and australia for downscaled cmip5 gcms due to post processing needs the daily resolved sdm was not available for this analysis instead a monthly resolution version of the dataset was used to create seasonal and annual scaling factors that were used to scale observed gridded rainfall in the same way as in empirical scaling see section 2 1 1 2 1 3 non homogeneous hidden markov model projections for selected victorian catchments from the non homogeneous hidden markov model nhmm statistical downscaling method hughes et al 1999 charles et al 1999 fu et al 2013a 2013b are available for selected catchments in nhmm daily rainfall amounts are stochastically generated from a distribution which is dependent on hidden weather states the sequence of weather states is determined by variability in large scale atmospheric predictors here nhmm is downscaled directly to catchments rather than points i e grid cells which was found to better reproduce the rainfall distribution fu et al 2013b nhmm can reproduce reasonably reliably the daily rainfall characteristics in terms of amounts and distributions this allows the dataset to be used directly as input into the hydrological model nhmm downscales 19 of the cmip5 gcms which are those gcms with the necessary output variables required for the method 2 1 4 the conformal cubic atmospheric model the conformal cubic atmospheric model ccam mcgregor 2005 mcgregor and dix 2008 is a variable resolution atmospheric model that ingest the gcm change signal through bias corrected gcm sea surface temperatures ssts it has a stretchable grid across the globe but for this experiment ccam outputs globally on a regular 0 5 resolution as part of the national projections ccam was run with ssts from six cmip5 gcms deemed to have high skill in simulating the regional climate see table 3 3 1 csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 an assessment of ccam by grose et al 2015 notes a stronger rainfall response to increased ssts compared to its host gcms this stronger relationship with ssts could be indicative of a positive bias in its rainfall projections whereas the previous three downscaling methods produce rainfall time series at point catchment scale and are produced for direct use in hydrological modelling applications ccam output covers larger grid cells table 1 an analysis of the ccam rainfall data showed that the daily time series had too few rainfall days and a highly skewed rainfall amount distribution i e too many large rainfall amounts compared to observed point scale rainfall time series as such the ccam daily rainfall time series were bias corrected i e relating ccam daily rainfall distribution in historical climatology simulations to observed daily rainfall distribution and using this relationship to convert ccam future daily rainfall to grid or catchment scale future daily rainfall to observed daily rainfall aggregated to either ccam grid cells for grid scale results fig 2 or catchments for the catchment results to adjust biases the double gamma distribution mapping bias correction method of teng et al 2015 was applied to the ccam output this method has previously been shown to provide a robust correction of biases in this geographical region teng et al 2015 2 1 5 the weather research and forecasting model the weather research and forecasting wrf model is a mesoscale atmospheric model with many applications both in numerical weather prediction and climate projections skamarock and klemp 2008 in a climate downscaling setup wrf reads in output from a gcm along its lateral and lower boundaries and simulates the climate on a finer resolution within those boundaries wrf was used to generate an ensemble of regional climate model simulations for new south wales nsw and the australian capital territory act narclim nsw act regional climate modelling evans et al 2014a the narclim projections use three different configurations of wrf in combination with four gcms that were selected to represent gcm uncertainty based on their skill and independence evans et al 2013 as evident from table 1 the narclim projections differ from other datasets in that they use climate change information from the previous generation of gcms i e gcms from the cmip3 archive meehl et al 2007 that follow the a2 scenario of the special report on emissions scenarios sres nakicenovic et al 2000 nevertheless as stated earlier this reflects a similar high emission scenario towards the end of the century this study used the bias corrected to awap daily rainfall series available through the narclim data portal evans and argüeso 2014b 2 2 runoff and catchment hydrological modelling rainfall runoff modelling is used to explore the effects of rainfall changes on streamflow and water availability six catchments were chosen from a subset of available gauges with good streamflow data completeness to represent a range of victoria s climatic and hydrological variability fig 1 mean annual climate and streamflow calibration nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and catchment area are shown in table 3 the majority of runoff in victoria occurs along the great dividing range to the east and as such the western catchments i e catchments 406213 406214 and 407215 have ephemeral hydrographs with no baseflow sustaining streamflow during the drier months typically autumn mam the eastern catchments are more representative of water supply catchments for victoria and are perennial streams brankeet creek 405251 is normally a perennial stream but became ephemeral during the millennium drought 1997 2009 largely due to decreased water tables and catchment storage during the prolonged and severe drought during those years csiro 2012 petheram et al 2011 gridded daily climate data were sourced from the bureau of meteorology at 0 05 0 05 approximately 5 km 5 km resolution across the study region from awap the 0 05 0 05 gridded daily rainfall data both unscaled and scaled to reflect future climate series were aggregated to provide daily catchment rainfall time series potential evapotranspiration was estimated from solar radiation vapour pressure and minimum and maximum temperature using morton s areal potential evapotranspiration pet formulation morton 1983 chiew and mcmahon 1991 the conceptual rainfall runoff model simhyd chiew et al 2002 was calibrated to historical 1975 2014 streamflow data using the shuffled complex evolution method duan et al 1992 with the bias penalised nse objective function of viney et al 2009 more details are provided by potter et al 2016 simhyd can satisfactory reproduce the observed time series in these catchments with daily nse generally greater than 0 75 more than reliable for the purpose of this study future runoff is modelled using the future rainfall time series for each downscaling method as described in section 2 1 in all cases we use historical potential evapotranspiration pet time series to force simhyd for future projections of runoff four key reasons being 1 the different methods estimate pet differently although we can estimate changes to pet by calculating pet from the changed climate variables 2 compared to rainfall pet is a secondary driver as the divergence among models of projected changes to pet is much smaller than projected changes to rainfall potter et al 2016 3 runoff is typically more sensitive to changes to rainfall than to pet in the medium term chiew 2006 potter et al 2011 and 4 using the same historical pet allows us to explore changes in runoff from the projected changes in rainfall alone we acknowledge that for other applications it may well be relevant to also use pet that includes a climate change signal 2 3 exploring metrics of extreme rainfall and flow whereas changes to annual and seasonal rainfall and runoff are relevant to understanding future broad scale water availability information on changes to these averages only is insufficient for many applications for example most dam inflows occur in response to high flow events and as such water managers may be more interested in changes to high flows than average flows as well as year to year variability in rainfall ecological resilience of a systems may depend on persistent low flow events as well as periodic high flow events to maintain hydrologic connectivity and volumes and water quality of floodplains lakes and rivers we explore the consistency and ability of different downscaling methods to model key metrics see section 3 4 based on rainfall and runoff that are deemed relevant to regional water managers environmental managers and other modellers dry days and dry spells proportion of days with rainfall less than 1 mm and the mean duration of dry spell

3 1 annual and seasonal median rainfall changes fig 2 shows the median percentage change in annual and seasonal rainfall from the gcm ensemble which is different for each downscaling method see table 2 the numbers overlaid on the maps show the percentage change in rainfall regionally over victoria as noted in section 2 1 see table 1 the nhmm data is downscaled to catchments whereas the other methods are downscaled to grids of different resolutions the changes from empirical scaling can be interpreted as the direct changes from the raw gcm signals the projected median change from empirical scaling and therefore from the gcms is a 2 5 decrease in annual rainfall for eastern victoria and a 5 10 decrease for western victoria compared to the raw gcm change signal sdm significantly enhances the projected drying nhmm projections are slightly drier than the raw gcm signal ccam is considerably wetter than the raw signal particularly for summer december to february djf and autumn march to may mam and in fact projects a median increase in annual rainfall of 1 5 averaged across victoria wrf projects a decrease in annual rainfall approximately half of the decrease from the raw gcm signal wrf projections of djf and mam rainfall are wetter than those from the gcms wrf also features a slight increase in winter june to august jja rainfall over the high rainfall area of the great dividing range see fig 1 which has consequences for runoff production in the wetter catchments as discussed later the projected rainfall decrease from the raw gcm signal occurs predominantly in winter jja and spring son parts of south eastern australia mostly north of victoria have projected increases in djf rainfall see csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 potter et al 2016 with the raw gcm signal in the north of victoria partly reflecting this fig 2 this increase in djf rainfall in northern victoria is also observed for wrf and ccam recent research however contends that the djf increase is due to gcms that perform poorly according to several climate metrics relevant to victoria hope et al 2016 grose et al 2016 the increase in djf is enhanced by wrf and especially ccam while sdm shows a significant decrease in djf rainfall changes to mam rainfall are most uncertain with wrf and ccam projecting increases but all other methods projecting decreases the jja signal is largely consistent except for slight increases due to wrf and the son signal is the most consistent with large projected decreases from all methods fig 3 shows the annual and jja rainfall change factors extracted to the six selected catchments overall there is little difference among catchments for each downscaling method except perhaps for wrf and ccam wrf has a slight tendency to project relatively more rainfall for the wetter catchments in jja and ccam has the same tendency but for annual rainfall overall however the differences between downscaling methods are larger than the differences between catchments which mirror the state wide results in fig 2 fig 3 also shows the range of results and not just the median as in fig 2 the entire gcm ensemble spans a large range which extends from projected increases at the wet end of the distribution to rainfall decreases at the dry end of the distribution see also potter et al 2016 csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 this large range of results featuring both increases and decreases are also seen in nhmm wrf and ccam but with a smaller range in the projections sdm on the other hand projects decreases in future rainfall even from the wetter members of the downscaled gcm ensemble 3 2 bias in rainfall from different gcm model ensembles the different downscaling methods each downscale a different set of host gcms see table 2 the selection of a drier or wetter subset of gcms would tend by itself to produce a drier or wetter change signal for the downscaling method fig 4 compares the empirically scaled runoff change signal using the full set of 42 gcms the empirically scaled change factor using each method s gcm subset and the downscaled change factor for sdm nhmm and ccam wrf was not considered for three reasons firstly the 4 gcms selected for the wrf modelling procedure were chosen to be fully representative of the gcm ensemble with an objective examination of the covariance in model errors evans et al 2013 secondly the wrf data is based on cmip3 and so we cannot directly compare the change signal to the restricted cmip5 ensemble thirdly the wrf gcm ensemble contains three different configurations of the model which should each be considered as independent models and again we are unable to use the cmip5 ensemble to directly compare to this result the results indicate that for the statistical downscaling methods the 22 gcms used for sdm and to a lesser extent the 19 gcms used for nhmm are drier than the full complement of 42 gcms used for empirical scaling this is true across the entire distribution median and interquartile ranges thus the gcm selection used by these methods results in a drier projection for both rainfall and runoff however sdm significantly enhances the decline in rainfall and modelled runoff projected by the gcms the change signal from nhmm is similar to that from the host gcms but with a smaller range the six gcms used for ccam tend to be very representative of the full cmip5 ensemble showing a projected median drying of between 10 and 30 for the study catchments but projections for annual runoff under ccam largely show no change this appears due to the quite different seasonal change signals for rainfall from ccam fig 2 with runoff occurring from the projected increase in rainfall in djf and mam largely offsetting smaller runoff declines in jja and son fig 5 3 3 projected changes to mean annual and seasonal runoff differences in the annual change signals for runoff in the six study catchments among downscaling methods closely follow the results for rainfall fig 2 the percentage change signal for rainfall is enhanced in the percentage change signal for runoff an effect often referred to as the rainfall elasticity e g chiew 2006 sdm and to a smaller extent nhmm are relatively drier and wrf and ccam relatively wetter than runoff resulting from empirical scaling although wrf has an overall decrease in annual rainfall fig 2 annual runoff is slightly wetter and this is because the main seasons in which runoff is produced mam and jja have increases in rainfall in particular along the high runoff producing region of the great dividing range in jja fig 2 this results in an increase in absolute runoff i e mm in mam and jja largely offsetting reductions in runoff in son and to a lesser extent djf generally the wetter catchments in terms of mean annual runoff have lower absolute change signal i e relatively less wet or dry in percentage terms except for ccam the two wettest catchments 405205 and 405241 have drying median change signals in the annual runoff the greater uncertainty from downscaling at least in terms of percentage changes occurs in the drier catchments with the 10 20 reduction in annual runoff projected by empirical downscaling either doubling under sdm to a reversed signal i e 10 20 increase in runoff under wrf and ccam the seasonal results roughly follow the annual results with a general increase in magnitude of the change signal consistent with catchment average response to rainfall changes chiew 2006 potter et al 2011 some projected seasonal changes e g ccam in djf and wrf in mam are for increases over 100 reflecting the increase in rainfall fig 2 this large percentage change partly reflects the change in the relatively low runoff percentage change of a small number in djf and mam and has relatively smaller effect on the annual runoff which is generated mostly in jja and son the most consistent signal in seasonal runoff is for a reduction in son runoff under all downscaling methods a response to a consistent change signal for son rainfall fig 2 3 4 projected changes to rainfall and runoff metrics 3 4 1 dry days and dry spells the first two rows in fig 6 show the projected changes in dry days number of days with rainfall less than 1 mm and mean dry spells mean of consecutive number of days with rainfall less than 1 mm empirical scaling scales all the observed historical daily rainfall with the same scaling factor for each of the four seasons informed by the change signal in the gcm and therefore reflects only a small increase in dry days and longer dry spells consistent with the generally drier future projections in the gcms sdm gives similar results but projects a larger increase in dry days and length of dry spells because of the drier future projections in sdm compared to empirical scaling or the gcms nhmm which takes into account potential changes in the daily rainfall distribution and sequencing show considerably larger increases in dry days and length of dry spells compared to empirical scaling and sdm wrf also shows considerable increases in dry days and length of dry spells despite the relatively smaller projected future mean annual rainfall declines compared to empirical scaling and sdm see fig 2 despite projections of a wetter future ccam results generally show little change in the dry days and dry spells 3 4 2 high rainfall high rainfall metrics are represented by the 1st percentile daily rainfall p1 third row of fig 6 and 3 day maximum rainfall total fourth row of fig 6 climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events over mid latitudes ipcc 2013 again the methods that scales the observed historical rainfall empirical scaling or use observed historical rainfall analogues sdm show decreases in the high rainfall amounts mirroring the projected decline in mean annual rainfall by the gcms in the three methods that consider potential changes in the daily rainfall distribution wrf and ccam projects higher p1 and 3 day maximum rainfall total whilst nhmm projects lower p1 and little change in the 3 day maximum rainfall total 3 4 3 year to year rainfall variability fig 7 shows the coefficient of variability cv i e the standard deviation divided by the mean for annual statistics of rainfall there is little discernible difference among catchments for all methods even more so than the results for changes to dry days and dry spells fig 6 scaling factor approaches do not have noticeable changes in the variability of annual rainfall totals and dry day less than 1 mm probabilities although annual rainfall can increase or decrease according to the scaling factors employed the standard deviation changes by a similar order of magnitude so that cv of annual rainfall is close to zero seasonal scaling using sdm and empirical scaling do not change dry day probabilities fig 6 and so dry day variability is likewise unchanged with these methods all other methods nhmm wrf and ccam show a tendency for increased variability of annual rainfall at least for the ensemble median the change signal in variability of maximum annual rainfall is less clear with the ensemble ranges covering zero change for most catchments and methods although nhmm and wrf project increases in dry day probabilities fig 6 the coefficient of variation in this probability appears to be similar there is a slight tendency for variability of dry day occurrences to decrease under ccam 3 4 4 low flow the modelled changes in future low flow metrics lowest 7 day runoff total 90th percentile daily runoff q90 and number of days with flows less than q90h are presented in the top three rows of fig 6 the sdm nhmm empirical scaling and wrf results for the three wetter catchments 405251 405205 405241 show a smaller 7 day minimum low runoff total lower q90 and more days with flows below q90h in the future these more severe or drier low flow metrics are consistent with the drier average future rainfall and runoff projections however there are significant differences in the projections from the different methods and the range of projections within each method is very large and much larger than the range of the rainfall characteristics in fig 6 results for the drier catchments are highly variable and difficult to interpret meaningfully partly because of the difficulty in reliably modelling low flow metrics in dry catchments and largely because the projected change shown here reflect percentage change to very small numbers e g minimum 7 day runoff total and q90 are close to zero in these dry catchments these low flow metrics are dependent on antecedent catchment storage and baseflow recession the average rainfall amounts as well as other rainfall runoff characteristics and not the dry days in section 3 4 1 that do not generate runoff that influence catchment storage and baseflow recession the rainfall and runoff characteristics that influence the low flow metrics can be different for different catchments and hydroclimate and hydrologic regimes making the low flow metrics difficult to model and predict potter et al 2015 hughes and potter 2015 rather than providing conclusive change information for the low flow characteristics in fig 8 the results here demonstrate the inherent uncertainty in low flow metrics particularly for drier ephemeral catchments 3 4 5 high flow the modelled changes in future high flow metrics 5th percentile daily runoff q5 number of days with flows more than q5h and 1st percentile daily runoff q1 are presented in the bottom three rows of fig 6 these high flow metrics are dependent on changes in the average rainfall and runoff as well as the high rainfall events that generate the high flows the sdm nhmm and empirical scaling results all show decreases in future high flow metrics driven by the drier projections of average rainfall and runoff and decrease in high rainfall p1 in these methods see section 3 4 2 and fig 6 wrf shows increases in the high flow metrics driven by the more intense high rainfalls see section 3 4 2 and fig 6 and moderated by the small declines in average rainfall section 3 1 and fig 2 it is interesting to note that despite projections of higher average rainfall and high daily rainfalls in ccam there is little change in the modelled future high flow metrics this may be due to projected changes in rainfall sequencing and serial correlation that are important for high runoff generation yet were not explored in fig 6 3 5 spatial detail of the downscaling methods another potential benefit of downscaling particularly through dynamic downscaling is the increased spatial resolution in the change signal as noted in table 1 there are significant differences among the spatial resolution of the different downscaling approaches to illustrate some of the issues and limitations or indeed potential added value of different methods we examine the different spatial detail of the annual rainfall change signal over the six study catchments fig 9 shows mapped rainfall from the five different downscaling methods cropped to the spatial extent of the study catchments this figure contains the same data from the top row of fig 2 although the colour scale limits have been reduced and the number of breakpoints increased to highlight differences within the regional colour scale the change signals from empirical scaling are derived directly from the gcm changes hence empirical scaling does not introduce any finer resolution information as demonstrated by the very small spatial variability between and within catchments fig 8 empirical the apparent contour lines in the middle panel of fig 2 being ensemble median results are the result of different gcms being selected at each grid cell and can be misleading in terms of spatial signal the different spatial resolutions of the other downscaling methods table 1 are immediately obvious from fig 9 with sdm and wrf having the finest resolution change signals 0 05 0 05 and 0 1 0 1 respectively followed by ccam 0 5 0 5 and nhmm for nhmm the rainfall is downscaled directly to catchments and so we expect no within catchment spatial variability in this method the between catchment variability is minimal with nhmm and this is largely a consequence of the nhmm method which seeks to preserve spatial correlations in rainfall signals for ccam within catchment spatial variability in the change signal is present for the larger catchments only but this resolution is not fine enough to differentiate between the upper and lower catchments in our study domain it is only for wrf and sdm that the resolution of change signal is fine enough to provide meaningful within catchment detail especially for the larger catchments the resolution of wrf appears to be fine enough to be able to distinguish different changes in the upper and lower catchments for large catchments with distinctive upland and lowland parts and hence different within catchment hydrological behaviour wrf can potentially provide spatial differences in the change signal particularly so since the median annual and seasonal change signals fig 2 show evident orographic gradients over the great dividing range the main geographic feature in victoria which corresponds roughly to the ridge of mean annual runoff above 1000 mm in fig 1 sdm has the finest scale information which is commensurate with the underlying gridded climate products commonly in use in australia e g silo and awap there is clear spatial variability within even the smallest catchments for this downscaling method however fig 9 also highlights a potential limitation with this method which is the sharp divide separating different calibration regions i e the diagonal line from the north of the area to the south east of the area see timbal et al 2011 sdm selects different climate variables for model calibration in different regions and this has resulted in variability of the change signal between catchments lying in different regions which is larger than the within catchment spatial variability note however that these spatial differences are much smaller in magnitude than the differences between downscaling methods cf fig 2 overall the finer resolution downscaling methods i e sdm and wrf appear to show spatial differences in change signal resulting from regional scale topography however further assessment is needed to assess the credibility of change signal on these resolutions 4 discussion in a previous comparison of downscaling choices for south eastern australia frost et al 2011 recommended using empirical scaling methods for regional water resource planning applications due principally to the simplicity and robustness of the method chiew et al 2010 found that results from daily scaling a form of empirical scaling typically lie within the range of other regionally available downscaling methods and this is consistent with our results however for hydrological applications empirically downscaled data has two important limitations firstly the scaling factor has the same resolution as the gcm thus change can only be detected on a spatial resolution of around 100 250 km depending on the resolution of the gcm which is a limitation for regions where it is reasonable to expect different climate change responses over short spatial ranges such as along orographic gradients secondly the method cannot capture changes that may influence the sequencing of weather events as the temporal variability is simply that of the scaled observed data this is relevant for water security modelling because catchment runoff relies on large rainfall events in conjunction with longer duration wet spells and reservoir and water resources management need to cope with multi year dry sequences catchment managers and environmental flow managers also need information about changes to low flow conditions such as changes in baseflow and the duration and severity of dry spells impacting water dependent ecosystems and river water quality the results in section 3 4 demonstrate the challenges in using different downscaled products to provide projections for these metrics we note that our use of inconsistent historical pet time series as described in section 2 2 affects daily runoff prediction more than the annual and seasonal runoff means however as noted before runoff sensitivity to pet is typically an order of magnitude lower than sensitivity to rainfall and the variability among downscaling methods particularly for low flow metrics is much larger than any expected bias from using historical pet we have shown that downscaling can modify the change signal of the gcms e g fig 5 particularly large changes were associated with runoff based on output from sdm and ccam we note that in its full capacity sdm is a daily resolution downscaling method as noted in section 2 1 2 we were unable to use the daily data instead we relied on the monthly data however the analysis of regional annual and seasonal rainfall changes using monthly data fig 2 would be identical if we had used daily data the runoff changes fig 3 are also comparable to recent runoff projections using monthly sdm fiddes and timbal 2017 hope et al 2016 however projected changes to the seasonal runoff in section 3 3 and particularly the rainfall and runoff metrics in section 3 4 would almost certainly be different using the daily downscaled data it is unclear whether wrf modifies the change signal of the gcm as well as we were not able to assess this against the cmip5 model ensemble change signals wrf using gcms from the cmip3 archive in this study we have not examined processes and methodology of the statistical and dynamical downscaling methods as such we are unable to state definitively the reason for the wetter or drier change signals in the different downscaling methods and indeed this may be a feature of the downscaling method in that they are correctly resolving subgrid processes this is a direction for future research which would require an in depth understanding of the biases and sub grid processes unique to each method with respect to sub setting gcms based on model skill recent research hope et al 2016 grose et al 2016 has examined the question of whether excluding gcms that are poor at producing climate characteristics relevant to victoria s climate it was found that many of the poorer performing gcms were underestimating the drying change signal seen for victoria and that sub setting the gcm ensemble in this way would produce drier projections future research and downscaling assessments could utilise these results to provide a more representative change signal for victoria and south eastern australia note however that the gcm selection for sdm nhmm and ccam see section 2 1 was not based on model performance criteria but by and large data availability in the host gcms climate projections contain uncertainties from many sources not only downscaling but uncertainty due to climate scenario model ensemble internal variability and rainfall runoff model and parameterisation kay et al 2009 chen et al 2011 bürger et al 2013 ahn et al 2016 characterising the contributions of all relevant sources of uncertainty is outside the scope of this paper due to inadequate sample representation of the different modelling stages but some qualitative assessments can be elucidated from our results csiro and bureau of meteorology 2016 illustrated the temporal change in the relative contribution of key sources of uncertainty for regions of australia following the method described in hawkins and sutton 2009 for southern australia and the time slice considered here approximately 50 years into the future the response uncertainty model ensemble spread due to response to changing emissions is larger than scenario uncertainty ensemble spread due to applied emission scenario and comparable to uncertainty from internal variability ensemble spread due to models simulation of internal natural climate variability as the projection window extends further into the future scenario uncertainty becomes relatively more pronounced bias correction can potentially be another source of uncertainty particularly for runoff teng et al 2015 whereas the relationships between atmospheric variables and precipitation fields in the statistical downscaling models used here are effectively constrained by observed rainfall rainfall from the dynamical downscaling models are not constrained by observations necessitating bias correction development of bias correction methods that properly correct precipitation for runoff modelling is a subject of ongoing research there are rigorous methods in the literature for the partitioning of uncertainty such as applying an anova type approach to decomposing the total variability in change signals into variability from gcm ensemble climate scenarios and downscaling bias correction e g bürger et al 2013 woldemeskel et al 2014 sunyer et al 2015 this approach is not applicable to our ensemble because of the different gcm downscaling combinations table 1 however total variability in for example mean annual runoff fig 4 appears to be approximately evenly split between variability from gcm model ensemble and downscaling method this is comparable to previous studies which found uncertainty from downscaling is somewhat less than uncertainty from gcm models but is greater than uncertainty from different rainfall runoff models chiew et al 2010 teng et al 2012b we conclude that different downscaling methods have significant effects on change signals in rainfall and runoff for southeast australia comparable but slightly less than the effect from the gcm ensemble scenario uncertainty becomes more important further into the future due to the cumulative impact of increasing emission concentrations in the atmosphere 5 conclusions in the absence of comprehensive downscaling ensembles based on statistical and dynamical downscaling empirical scaling has been generally recommended and often used for regional future water availability assessments in south eastern australia the method is robust relatively easy to use computationally less expensive and typically produces responses lying between other downscaling methods however the method is restrictive in terms of end user requirements and expectations who are interested in questions about changes to extreme high and low rainfall and runoff events and seeking information on within catchment and smaller scale spatial variability of the change signal we examined five alternative downscaling methods available for south eastern australia at the present time consistent with previous downscaling assessments e g chiew et al 2010 frost et al 2011 the change signals for rainfall and runoff arising from empirical scaling lie between those from the other methods the statistical downscaling methods sdm and nhmm produced drier change signals and the dynamical downscaling methods wrf and ccam produced wetter change signals in terms of mean annual and seasonal changes to rainfall and runoff although there is a large degree of uncertainty the reductions in rainfall and runoff in son and to a lesser extent jja appear to be relatively consistent across the downscaling methods and this is consistent too with current understanding of recent and future climate trends in the region hope et al 2017 the results for extreme rainfall and runoff metrics show significantly more differences among the downscaling methods although empirical scaling is unable to provide meaningful information on changes to rainfall sequencing i e wet dry day occurrences by defining a dry day as one with a non zero but insignificant amount of rainfall e g 1 mm changes to dry days and dry spells under empirical scaling appeared to be very similar to those from downscaling methods that do alter the sequencing of rainfall however other metrics that rely to a larger extent on the sequencing of rainfall events e g 3 day maximum rainfall cannot be adequately modelled with empirical scaling year to year variability in annual rainfall is projected to be slightly larger in the far future time period under non scaling methods although uncertainty in this signal remains challenging there was reasonable agreement among downscaling methods on the likely changes to low flow metrics but only for high runoff catchments this is due to low flow metrics being more difficult to measure and model compared to high and moderate flows particularly for drier catchments in this analysis changes to rainfall extremes and to a lesser extent changes to high runoff metrics are largely related to changes to mean rainfall this gives confidence in the predictability of these metrics under different downscaling methods noting that large differences in downscaled mean rainfall across south eastern australia reduce any confidence level attributed to the projected change in high rainfall and runoff in this region we also stress that where specific rainfall or runoff metrics are important for an application we recommend choosing the metrics models and downscaling methods carefully to be able to make meaningful statements about probable or likely changes to these metrics there is potential added value from statistical and dynamical downscaling methods in providing increased spatial information on future change signals both sdm and wrf provide output on resolutions that resolve within catchment

7049,downscaling is the process by which output from global climate models is translated to finer resolution regional scale projections often used in impact studies many fundamentally different techniques can be used each with different capabilities of resolving or representing sub gridscale processes the different formulations can lead to variations in the downscaled output with consequential impacts in the interpretation of future change here future runoff is estimated for six catchments in the australian state of victoria using five different regional rainfall projection products we investigate how differences in rainfall input manifest in a selection of regionally important hydroclimate metrics overall annual runoff is projected to decline under most methods but seasonal changes are more uncertain reflecting differences in the rainfall change signal for different downscaled products whilst change in flow metrics are mostly consistent with rainfall change factors changes in low flow e g 7 day minimum flow show considerable uncertainty especially for drier ephemeral catchments results from empirical simple scaling of climate observations generally lie within the range of more complex downscaling methods however empirical scaling is unable to provide meaningful information on spatial heterogeneity in the change signals as well as for several metrics of rainfall and runoff other downscaling methods can potentially provide information on these but the large uncertainty remains a problem as well as our currently poor understanding of method related biases keywords downscaling hydroclimate projections climate change runoff victoria australia 1 introduction planning for the future is an integral part of managing water resources poff et al 2016 even more so in regions with large natural variability and periodically scarce supply such are the conditions in southeast australia where long term trends show an ongoing decline of cool season april to october rainfall since the early 1990s hope et al 2016 since the cool season is the filling season for regional reservoirs in southeast australia there is concern among water users that the observed decline may continue into future decades potter and chiew 2009 2011 potter et al 2011 the current national climate projections for the region suggest high confidence in drying in southern australia particularly in spring september to november as a response to shifts in westerlies and strengthening of the subtropical ridge csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 these findings further enhance concern for future water supply in the region to provide meaningful information for water resource impact assessments the coarse spatial signal from global climate models gcms needs to be downscaled to finer resolution scales i e point or catchment scale because downscaling methods vary in technical formulation and complexity for some variables and regions downscaling methods can produce very different results many downscaling comparisons have been conducted to demonstrate and understand the plausible range of projections in downscaling ensembles see e g fowler et al 2007 chiew et al 2010 chen et al 2011 frost et al 2011 grose et al 2015 sunyer et al 2015 the state government of victoria australia provides guidance about future change to runoff for water corporations catchment management authorities and industries to manage and plan for long term risks to water supply delwp 2016 guidance for a 50 year time horizon is contained in the state s water supply and demand wsd plans a document that is revised every 5 years the most recent hydroclimate projections supporting the wsd planning considered both gcm projected change and observed decadal variability the gcm based projections used climate change information from 42 models from the fifth climate model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 downscaled to the region using a change factor approach potter et al 2016 however as recently shown by ekström et al 2016 there is emerging evidence of a regional change signal in available downscaling products that is not reflected in gcm based projections for southeast australia the nature of this change signal differs between different downscaling products making it difficult for users of these datasets to assess their relative value in comparison to the gcm based projections if using climate change projections for policy guidance researchers need to carefully consider the choice of methods used and sources of information of primary importance is the representation of key sources of uncertainty in global climate change information and secondly ensuring that the method or methods used to derive a regional resolved projection have the capacity to translate the aspect of change relevant to the application e g to spell duration or extremes the key sources of uncertainty are found in 1 the emission scenarios used for the global climate modelling uncertainties about the species and rate of greenhouse gas ghg emissions 2 the models used to simulate the climate response to the changing ghg emissions aspects of model structure and parameter schemes that influence the models ability to simulate the climate and 3 natural climate variability the ability of the model to simulate the full range variability in the climate not arising from emission forcing to attempt to represent these sources of uncertainty researchers can consider gcm output using a range of emission scenarios such as the representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 and consider the use of a large number of gcms to sample model ability to simulate forced and internal climate variability each additional manipulation of data adds some level of uncertainty to the outcomes such as the downscaling step and the impact modelling itself for example many hydrological models are conceptual models relying on a robust calibration to provide good estimates of streamflow under changing climate conditions these assumptions may no longer hold this challenge is often referred to as the non stationarity problem discussed at length by several authors milly et al 2008 potter et al 2013 saft et al 2016 chiew et al 2017 an additional concern for projections is the choice of baseline period this is the choice of time window for which the future data is compared and represents the future climate see e g timbal et al 2016 potter et al 2016 further details on the production of climate change datasets and the impact on policy guidance is detailed in harris et al 2014 and ekström et al 2016 in this study we examine rainfall from the five different downscaled datasets that are currently available for six representative catchments in the state of victoria the aim is to quantify differences in rainfall projections by different available downscaled climate change datasets and further examine how such differences manifest in metrics derived from streamflow modelled using the different downscaled datasets the ensemble of datasets is an ensemble of opportunity representing all downscaled datasets available for the region in 2017 because of the opportunistic nature of this ensemble there is some variation in the use of emission scenario cmip archive and slight difference in time horizons however all selected projections have the common purpose of illustrating regional climate change for a far future time horizon under a high emission scenario and the ensemble represents the current information available to researchers planners and purveyors of climate change information section 2 outlines the downscaling methods climate data and hydrological modelling used in this study section 3 presents changes in mean annual and seasonal rainfall across victoria annual and seasonal runoff for six study catchments and changes in key rainfall and runoff metrics as well as the differing spatial resolution of the different downscaling methods and the potential for providing within catchment climate information section 4 discusses limitations of the study and directions for future research and section 5 gives conclusions and recommendations 2 data and methods 2 1 downscaled rainfall datasets there are many fundamentally different approaches used to achieve a finer resolved climate projection it is well established that different methods can influence what aspects of the gcm change signal are translated to the finer resolved downscaled data set e g fowler et al 2007 chen et al 2011 ekström et al 2015 briefly downscaling methods can be categorised as 1 empirical downscaling or change factor methods which apply projected changes in the distribution of gcm rainfall to observed point or catchment scale climate data 2 statistical downscaling methods which use statistical relationships based on observed data and apply these on gcm output to derive a local variable estimate and 3 dynamical downscaling methods typically involving regional climate models rcms that simulate physical processes at a finer spatial scale using boundary conditions from a host gcm this study considers all currently available downscaled datasets in south eastern australia with output that is readily available for hydrological modelling table 1 the datasets are produced by different research initiatives across the region the victorian climate initiative hope et al 2016 and its predecessor the south eastern australian climate initiative csiro 2012 the new south wales and australian capital territory regional climate modelling narclim project evans et al 2014a and two datasets created to support the national climate projections csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 the methods used to create these datasets are fundamentally different ranging from empirical scaling to dynamical downscaling furthermore there are some differences in the projected time horizon gcm selection and emission scenario used table 1 table 2 provides a full list of the gcms downscaled by each method mean annual regional rainfall for twenty year climate baselines are within 2 of the 20th century annual average potter et al 2016 and the historical time periods are consistent with current recommendations for choosing baseline climate periods for southeast australia timbal et al 2016 while acknowledging differences among datasets we use these datasets in a comparative study to demonstrate the range in streamflow projections for a far future period under a high emission scenario note that for consistency we use historical potential evapotranspiration for the hydrological modelling as described in section 2 2 each dataset is described below it is important to note that precipitation data from the two dynamical downscaling methods wrf and ccam were bias corrected as described in sections 2 1 4 and 2 1 5 we did not bias correct the statistical methods nhmm and sdm since these methods have already been constrained to observed rainfall gauges in the region that is we consider the data processing methods used by the statistical methods sufficient for hydrological modelling without further post processing in contrast the dynamical methods are designed to represent the regional climate dynamics holistically as such precipitation is not explicitly constrained to observations with the result that dynamical methods typically produce biases in rainfall occurrences and amounts teutschbein and seibert 2010 necessitating bias correction before hydrological modelling 2 1 1 empirical scaling empirical scaling has been recommended for use in regional water availability studies frost et al 2011 and underpins recent runoff projections for south eastern australia csiro 2008 chiew et al 2009 post et al 2012 and victoria potter et al 2016 the premise of empirical scaling is that climate information from gcms particularly rainfall is not directly usable in hydrological models since the distribution of gcm rainfall is different from the observed catchment scale daily rainfall distribution however empirical scaling assumes that gcms have sufficient skill to reasonably model future changes in the annual and seasonal rainfall averages these annual and seasonal change factors are then extracted from the gcm historical and future runs and applied to observed catchment or station rainfall and potential evapotranspiration time series empirical scaling therefore relies directly on the observed climate time series and does not consider potential changes in rainfall occurrences and sequences and other finer scale temporal variability the observational datasets used here are the gridded daily rainfall and temperature observations of the australian water availability project awap jones et al 2009 the same gridded datasets were used for empirical scaling to inform the most recent production of regional streamflow projections for victoria potter et al 2016 more details on these data can be found in section 2 2 here scaling uses seasonal and annual scaling factors from 42 cmip5 gcms annual and seasonal means are calculated for the historical and future time periods table 1 for each gcm seasonal change factors are used to scale daily rainfall in each season individually and the annual change factor is used to scale the seasonally scaled rainfall time series to preserve the annual change in gcm rainfall 2 1 2 the statistical downscaling model the statistical downscaling model sdm timbal et al 2009 2011 was one of two downscaling methods used to complement the otherwise gcm based national climate projections by csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 the second being the dynamical downscaling output by ccam see section 2 1 4 the sdm method seeks meteorological analogues of future atmospheric variables from the historical data to develop future rainfall projections relating observed rainfall and temperature to reanalysis atmospheric predictors mean sea level pressure temperature rainfall humidity and wind speeds these statistical relationships are then used with future gcm projections of atmospheric predictors including rainfall to produce future time series of rainfall and maximum temperature the sdm was applied to 22 cmip5 models see table 2 which were those gcms with the necessary output variables required for the method to produce daily and monthly climate time series across victoria and australia for downscaled cmip5 gcms due to post processing needs the daily resolved sdm was not available for this analysis instead a monthly resolution version of the dataset was used to create seasonal and annual scaling factors that were used to scale observed gridded rainfall in the same way as in empirical scaling see section 2 1 1 2 1 3 non homogeneous hidden markov model projections for selected victorian catchments from the non homogeneous hidden markov model nhmm statistical downscaling method hughes et al 1999 charles et al 1999 fu et al 2013a 2013b are available for selected catchments in nhmm daily rainfall amounts are stochastically generated from a distribution which is dependent on hidden weather states the sequence of weather states is determined by variability in large scale atmospheric predictors here nhmm is downscaled directly to catchments rather than points i e grid cells which was found to better reproduce the rainfall distribution fu et al 2013b nhmm can reproduce reasonably reliably the daily rainfall characteristics in terms of amounts and distributions this allows the dataset to be used directly as input into the hydrological model nhmm downscales 19 of the cmip5 gcms which are those gcms with the necessary output variables required for the method 2 1 4 the conformal cubic atmospheric model the conformal cubic atmospheric model ccam mcgregor 2005 mcgregor and dix 2008 is a variable resolution atmospheric model that ingest the gcm change signal through bias corrected gcm sea surface temperatures ssts it has a stretchable grid across the globe but for this experiment ccam outputs globally on a regular 0 5 resolution as part of the national projections ccam was run with ssts from six cmip5 gcms deemed to have high skill in simulating the regional climate see table 3 3 1 csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 an assessment of ccam by grose et al 2015 notes a stronger rainfall response to increased ssts compared to its host gcms this stronger relationship with ssts could be indicative of a positive bias in its rainfall projections whereas the previous three downscaling methods produce rainfall time series at point catchment scale and are produced for direct use in hydrological modelling applications ccam output covers larger grid cells table 1 an analysis of the ccam rainfall data showed that the daily time series had too few rainfall days and a highly skewed rainfall amount distribution i e too many large rainfall amounts compared to observed point scale rainfall time series as such the ccam daily rainfall time series were bias corrected i e relating ccam daily rainfall distribution in historical climatology simulations to observed daily rainfall distribution and using this relationship to convert ccam future daily rainfall to grid or catchment scale future daily rainfall to observed daily rainfall aggregated to either ccam grid cells for grid scale results fig 2 or catchments for the catchment results to adjust biases the double gamma distribution mapping bias correction method of teng et al 2015 was applied to the ccam output this method has previously been shown to provide a robust correction of biases in this geographical region teng et al 2015 2 1 5 the weather research and forecasting model the weather research and forecasting wrf model is a mesoscale atmospheric model with many applications both in numerical weather prediction and climate projections skamarock and klemp 2008 in a climate downscaling setup wrf reads in output from a gcm along its lateral and lower boundaries and simulates the climate on a finer resolution within those boundaries wrf was used to generate an ensemble of regional climate model simulations for new south wales nsw and the australian capital territory act narclim nsw act regional climate modelling evans et al 2014a the narclim projections use three different configurations of wrf in combination with four gcms that were selected to represent gcm uncertainty based on their skill and independence evans et al 2013 as evident from table 1 the narclim projections differ from other datasets in that they use climate change information from the previous generation of gcms i e gcms from the cmip3 archive meehl et al 2007 that follow the a2 scenario of the special report on emissions scenarios sres nakicenovic et al 2000 nevertheless as stated earlier this reflects a similar high emission scenario towards the end of the century this study used the bias corrected to awap daily rainfall series available through the narclim data portal evans and argüeso 2014b 2 2 runoff and catchment hydrological modelling rainfall runoff modelling is used to explore the effects of rainfall changes on streamflow and water availability six catchments were chosen from a subset of available gauges with good streamflow data completeness to represent a range of victoria s climatic and hydrological variability fig 1 mean annual climate and streamflow calibration nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and catchment area are shown in table 3 the majority of runoff in victoria occurs along the great dividing range to the east and as such the western catchments i e catchments 406213 406214 and 407215 have ephemeral hydrographs with no baseflow sustaining streamflow during the drier months typically autumn mam the eastern catchments are more representative of water supply catchments for victoria and are perennial streams brankeet creek 405251 is normally a perennial stream but became ephemeral during the millennium drought 1997 2009 largely due to decreased water tables and catchment storage during the prolonged and severe drought during those years csiro 2012 petheram et al 2011 gridded daily climate data were sourced from the bureau of meteorology at 0 05 0 05 approximately 5 km 5 km resolution across the study region from awap the 0 05 0 05 gridded daily rainfall data both unscaled and scaled to reflect future climate series were aggregated to provide daily catchment rainfall time series potential evapotranspiration was estimated from solar radiation vapour pressure and minimum and maximum temperature using morton s areal potential evapotranspiration pet formulation morton 1983 chiew and mcmahon 1991 the conceptual rainfall runoff model simhyd chiew et al 2002 was calibrated to historical 1975 2014 streamflow data using the shuffled complex evolution method duan et al 1992 with the bias penalised nse objective function of viney et al 2009 more details are provided by potter et al 2016 simhyd can satisfactory reproduce the observed time series in these catchments with daily nse generally greater than 0 75 more than reliable for the purpose of this study future runoff is modelled using the future rainfall time series for each downscaling method as described in section 2 1 in all cases we use historical potential evapotranspiration pet time series to force simhyd for future projections of runoff four key reasons being 1 the different methods estimate pet differently although we can estimate changes to pet by calculating pet from the changed climate variables 2 compared to rainfall pet is a secondary driver as the divergence among models of projected changes to pet is much smaller than projected changes to rainfall potter et al 2016 3 runoff is typically more sensitive to changes to rainfall than to pet in the medium term chiew 2006 potter et al 2011 and 4 using the same historical pet allows us to explore changes in runoff from the projected changes in rainfall alone we acknowledge that for other applications it may well be relevant to also use pet that includes a climate change signal 2 3 exploring metrics of extreme rainfall and flow whereas changes to annual and seasonal rainfall and runoff are relevant to understanding future broad scale water availability information on changes to these averages only is insufficient for many applications for example most dam inflows occur in response to high flow events and as such water managers may be more interested in changes to high flows than average flows as well as year to year variability in rainfall ecological resilience of a systems may depend on persistent low flow events as well as periodic high flow events to maintain hydrologic connectivity and volumes and water quality of floodplains lakes and rivers we explore the consistency and ability of different downscaling methods to model key metrics see section 3 4 based on rainfall and runoff that

3 1 annual and seasonal median rainfall changes fig 2 shows the median percentage change in annual and seasonal rainfall from the gcm ensemble which is different for each downscaling method see table 2 the numbers overlaid on the maps show the percentage change in rainfall regionally over victoria as noted in section 2 1 see table 1 the nhmm data is downscaled to catchments whereas the other methods are downscaled to grids of different resolutions the changes from empirical scaling can be interpreted as the direct changes from the raw gcm signals the projected median change from empirical scaling and therefore from the gcms is a 2 5 decrease in annual rainfall for eastern victoria and a 5 10 decrease for western victoria compared to the raw gcm change signal sdm significantly enhances the projected drying nhmm projections are slightly drier than the raw gcm signal ccam is considerably wetter than the raw signal particularly for summer december to february djf and autumn march to may mam and in fact projects a median increase in annual rainfall of 1 5 averaged across victoria wrf projects a decrease in annual rainfall approximately half of the decrease from the raw gcm signal wrf projections of djf and mam rainfall are wetter than those from the gcms wrf also features a slight increase in winter june to august jja rainfall over the high rainfall area of the great dividing range see fig 1 which has consequences for runoff production in the wetter catchments as discussed later the projected rainfall decrease from the raw gcm signal occurs predominantly in winter jja and spring son parts of south eastern australia mostly north of victoria have projected increases in djf rainfall see csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 potter et al 2016 with the raw gcm signal in the north of victoria partly reflecting this fig 2 this increase in djf rainfall in northern victoria is also observed for wrf and ccam recent research however contends that the djf increase is due to gcms that perform poorly according to several climate metrics relevant to victoria hope et al 2016 grose et al 2016 the increase in djf is enhanced by wrf and especially ccam while sdm shows a significant decrease in djf rainfall changes to mam rainfall are most uncertain with wrf and ccam projecting increases but all other methods projecting decreases the jja signal is largely consistent except for slight increases due to wrf and the son signal is the most consistent with large projected decreases from all methods fig 3 shows the annual and jja rainfall change factors extracted to the six selected catchments overall there is little difference among catchments for each downscaling method except perhaps for wrf and ccam wrf has a slight tendency to project relatively more rainfall for the wetter catchments in jja and ccam has the same tendency but for annual rainfall overall however the differences between downscaling methods are larger than the differences between catchments which mirror the state wide results in fig 2 fig 3 also shows the range of results and not just the median as in fig 2 the entire gcm ensemble spans a large range which extends from projected increases at the wet end of the distribution to rainfall decreases at the dry end of the distribution see also potter et al 2016 csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 this large range of results featuring both increases and decreases are also seen in nhmm wrf and ccam but with a smaller range in the projections sdm on the other hand projects decreases in future rainfall even from the wetter members of the downscaled gcm ensemble 3 2 bias in rainfall from different gcm model ensembles the different downscaling methods each downscale a different set of host gcms see table 2 the selection of a drier or wetter subset of gcms would tend by itself to produce a drier or wetter change signal for the downscaling method fig 4 compares the empirically scaled runoff change signal using the full set of 42 gcms the empirically scaled change factor using each method s gcm subset and the downscaled change factor for sdm nhmm and ccam wrf was not considered for three reasons firstly the 4 gcms selected for the wrf modelling procedure were chosen to be fully representative of the gcm ensemble with an objective examination of the covariance in model errors evans et al 2013 secondly the wrf data is based on cmip3 and so we cannot directly compare the change signal to the restricted cmip5 ensemble thirdly the wrf gcm ensemble contains three different configurations of the model which should each be considered as independent models and again we are unable to use the cmip5 ensemble to directly compare to this result the results indicate that for the statistical downscaling methods the 22 gcms used for sdm and to a lesser extent the 19 gcms used for nhmm are drier than the full complement of 42 gcms used for empirical scaling this is true across the entire distribution median and interquartile ranges thus the gcm selection used by these methods results in a drier projection for both rainfall and runoff however sdm significantly enhances the decline in rainfall and modelled runoff projected by the gcms the change signal from nhmm is similar to that from the host gcms but with a smaller range the six gcms used for ccam tend to be very representative of the full cmip5 ensemble showing a projected median drying of between 10 and 30 for the study catchments but projections for annual runoff under ccam largely show no change this appears due to the quite different seasonal change signals for rainfall from ccam fig 2 with runoff occurring from the projected increase in rainfall in djf and mam largely offsetting smaller runoff declines in jja and son fig 5 3 3 projected changes to mean annual and seasonal runoff differences in the annual change signals for runoff in the six study catchments among downscaling methods closely follow the results for rainfall fig 2 the percentage change signal for rainfall is enhanced in the percentage change signal for runoff an effect often referred to as the rainfall elasticity e g chiew 2006 sdm and to a smaller extent nhmm are relatively drier and wrf and ccam relatively wetter than runoff resulting from empirical scaling although wrf has an overall decrease in annual rainfall fig 2 annual runoff is slightly wetter and this is because the main seasons in which runoff is produced mam and jja have increases in rainfall in particular along the high runoff producing region of the great dividing range in jja fig 2 this results in an increase in absolute runoff i e mm in mam and jja largely offsetting reductions in runoff in son and to a lesser extent djf generally the wetter catchments in terms of mean annual runoff have lower absolute change signal i e relatively less wet or dry in percentage terms except for ccam the two wettest catchments 405205 and 405241 have drying median change signals in the annual runoff the greater uncertainty from downscaling at least in terms of percentage changes occurs in the drier catchments with the 10 20 reduction in annual runoff projected by empirical downscaling either doubling under sdm to a reversed signal i e 10 20 increase in runoff under wrf and ccam the seasonal results roughly follow the annual results with a general increase in magnitude of the change signal consistent with catchment average response to rainfall changes chiew 2006 potter et al 2011 some projected seasonal changes e g ccam in djf and wrf in mam are for increases over 100 reflecting the increase in rainfall fig 2 this large percentage change partly reflects the change in the relatively low runoff percentage change of a small number in djf and mam and has relatively smaller effect on the annual runoff which is generated mostly in jja and son the most consistent signal in seasonal runoff is for a reduction in son runoff under all downscaling methods a response to a consistent change signal for son rainfall fig 2 3 4 projected changes to rainfall and runoff metrics 3 4 1 dry days and dry spells the first two rows in fig 6 show the projected changes in dry days number of days with rainfall less than 1 mm and mean dry spells mean of consecutive number of days with rainfall less than 1 mm empirical scaling scales all the observed historical daily rainfall with the same scaling factor for each of the four seasons informed by the change signal in the gcm and therefore reflects only a small increase in dry days and longer dry spells consistent with the generally drier future projections in the gcms sdm gives similar results but projects a larger increase in dry days and length of dry spells because of the drier future projections in sdm compared to empirical scaling or the gcms nhmm which takes into account potential changes in the daily rainfall distribution and sequencing show considerably larger increases in dry days and length of dry spells compared to empirical scaling and sdm wrf also shows considerable increases in dry days and length of dry spells despite the relatively smaller projected future mean annual rainfall declines compared to empirical scaling and sdm see fig 2 despite projections of a wetter future ccam results generally show little change in the dry days and dry spells 3 4 2 high rainfall high rainfall metrics are represented by the 1st percentile daily rainfall p1 third row of fig 6 and 3 day maximum rainfall total fourth row of fig 6 climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events over mid latitudes ipcc 2013 again the methods that scales the observed historical rainfall empirical scaling or use observed historical rainfall analogues sdm show decreases in the high rainfall amounts mirroring the projected decline in mean annual rainfall by the gcms in the three methods that consider potential changes in the daily rainfall distribution wrf and ccam projects higher p1 and 3 day maximum rainfall total whilst nhmm projects lower p1 and little change in the 3 day maximum rainfall total 3 4 3 year to year rainfall variability fig 7 shows the coefficient of variability cv i e the standard deviation divided by the mean for annual statistics of rainfall there is little discernible difference among catchments for all methods even more so than the results for changes to dry days and dry spells fig 6 scaling factor approaches do not have noticeable changes in the variability of annual rainfall totals and dry day less than 1 mm probabilities although annual rainfall can increase or decrease according to the scaling factors employed the standard deviation changes by a similar order of magnitude so that cv of annual rainfall is close to zero seasonal scaling using sdm and empirical scaling do not change dry day probabilities fig 6 and so dry day variability is likewise unchanged with these methods all other methods nhmm wrf and ccam show a tendency for increased variability of annual rainfall at least for the ensemble median the change signal in variability of maximum annual rainfall is less clear with the ensemble ranges covering zero change for most catchments and methods although nhmm and wrf project increases in dry day probabilities fig 6 the coefficient of variation in this probability appears to be similar there is a slight tendency for variability of dry day occurrences to decrease under ccam 3 4 4 low flow the modelled changes in future low flow metrics lowest 7 day runoff total 90th percentile daily runoff q90 and number of days with flows less than q90h are presented in the top three rows of fig 6 the sdm nhmm empirical scaling and wrf results for the three wetter catchments 405251 405205 405241 show a smaller 7 day minimum low runoff total lower q90 and more days with flows below q90h in the future these more severe or drier low flow metrics are consistent with the drier average future rainfall and runoff projections however there are significant differences in the projections from the different methods and the range of projections within each method is very large and much larger than the range of the rainfall characteristics in fig 6 results for the drier catchments are highly variable and difficult to interpret meaningfully partly because of the difficulty in reliably modelling low flow metrics in dry catchments and largely because the projected change shown here reflect percentage change to very small numbers e g minimum 7 day runoff total and q90 are close to zero in these dry catchments these low flow metrics are dependent on antecedent catchment storage and baseflow recession the average rainfall amounts as well as other rainfall runoff characteristics and not the dry days in section 3 4 1 that do not generate runoff that influence catchment storage and baseflow recession the rainfall and runoff characteristics that influence the low flow metrics can be different for different catchments and hydroclimate and hydrologic regimes making the low flow metrics difficult to model and predict potter et al 2015 hughes and potter 2015 rather than providing conclusive change information for the low flow characteristics in fig 8 the results here demonstrate the inherent uncertainty in low flow metrics particularly for drier ephemeral catchments 3 4 5 high flow the modelled changes in future high flow metrics 5th percentile daily runoff q5 number of days with flows more than q5h and 1st percentile daily runoff q1 are presented in the bottom three rows of fig 6 these high flow metrics are dependent on changes in the average rainfall and runoff as well as the high rainfall events that generate the high flows the sdm nhmm and empirical scaling results all show decreases in future high flow metrics driven by the drier projections of average rainfall and runoff and decrease in high rainfall p1 in these methods see section 3 4 2 and fig 6 wrf shows increases in the high flow metrics driven by the more intense high rainfalls see section 3 4 2 and fig 6 and moderated by the small declines in average rainfall section 3 1 and fig 2 it is interesting to note that despite projections of higher average rainfall and high daily rainfalls in ccam there is little change in the modelled future high flow metrics this may be due to projected changes in rainfall sequencing and serial correlation that are important for high runoff generation yet were not explored in fig 6 3 5 spatial detail of the downscaling methods another potential benefit of downscaling particularly through dynamic downscaling is the increased spatial resolution in the change signal as noted in table 1 there are significant differences among the spatial resolution of the different downscaling approaches to illustrate some of the issues and limitations or indeed potential added value of different methods we examine the different spatial detail of the annual rainfall change signal over the six study catchments fig 9 shows mapped rainfall from the five different downscaling methods cropped to the spatial extent of the study catchments this figure contains the same data from the top row of fig 2 although the colour scale limits have been reduced and the number of breakpoints increased to highlight differences within the regional colour scale the change signals from empirical scaling are derived directly from the gcm changes hence empirical scaling does not introduce any finer resolution information as demonstrated by the very small spatial variability between and within catchments fig 8 empirical the apparent contour lines in the middle panel of fig 2 being ensemble median results are the result of different gcms being selected at each grid cell and can be misleading in terms of spatial signal the different spatial resolutions of the other downscaling methods table 1 are immediately obvious from fig 9 with sdm and wrf having the finest resolution change signals 0 05 0 05 and 0 1 0 1 respectively followed by ccam 0 5 0 5 and nhmm for nhmm the rainfall is downscaled directly to catchments and so we expect no within catchment spatial variability in this method the between catchment variability is minimal with nhmm and this is largely a consequence of the nhmm method which seeks to preserve spatial correlations in rainfall signals for ccam within catchment spatial variability in the change signal is present for the larger catchments only but this resolution is not fine enough to differentiate between the upper and lower catchments in our study domain it is only for wrf and sdm that the resolution of change signal is fine enough to provide meaningful within catchment detail especially for the larger catchments the resolution of wrf appears to be fine enough to be able to distinguish different changes in the upper and lower catchments for large catchments with distinctive upland and lowland parts and hence different within catchment hydrological behaviour wrf can potentially provide spatial differences in the change signal particularly so since the median annual and seasonal change signals fig 2 show evident orographic gradients over the great dividing range the main geographic feature in victoria which corresponds roughly to the ridge of mean annual runoff above 1000 mm in fig 1 sdm has the finest scale information which is commensurate with the underlying gridded climate products commonly in use in australia e g silo and awap there is clear spatial variability within even the smallest catchments for this downscaling method however fig 9 also highlights a potential limitation with this method which is the sharp divide separating different calibration regions i e the diagonal line from the north of the area to the south east of the area see timbal et al 2011 sdm selects different climate variables for model calibration in different regions and this has resulted in variability of the change signal between catchments lying in different regions which is larger than the within catchment spatial variability note however that these spatial differences are much smaller in magnitude than the differences between downscaling methods cf fig 2 overall the finer resolution downscaling methods i e sdm and wrf appear to show spatial differences in change signal resulting from regional scale topography however further assessment is needed to assess the credibility of change signal on these resolutions 4 discussion in a previous comparison of downscaling choices for south eastern australia frost et al 2011 recommended using empirical scaling methods for regional water resource planning applications due principally to the simplicity and robustness of the method chiew et al 2010 found that results from daily scaling a form of empirical scaling typically lie within the range of other regionally available downscaling methods and this is consistent with our results however for hydrological applications empirically downscaled data has two important limitations firstly the scaling factor has the same resolution as the gcm thus change can only be detected on a spatial resolution of around 100 250 km depending on the resolution of the gcm which is a limitation for regions where it is reasonable to expect different climate change responses over short spatial ranges such as along orographic gradients secondly the method cannot capture changes that may influence the sequencing of weather events as the temporal variability is simply that of the scaled observed data this is relevant for water security modelling because catchment runoff relies on large rainfall events in conjunction with longer duration wet spells and reservoir and water resources management need to cope with multi year dry sequences catchment managers and environmental flow managers also need information about changes to low flow conditions such as changes in baseflow and the duration and severity of dry spells impacting water dependent ecosystems and river water quality the results in section 3 4 demonstrate the challenges in using different downscaled products to provide projections for these metrics we note that our use of inconsistent historical pet time series as described in section 2 2 affects daily runoff prediction more than the annual and seasonal runoff means however as noted before runoff sensitivity to pet is typically an order of magnitude lower than sensitivity to rainfall and the variability among downscaling methods particularly for low flow metrics is much larger than any expected bias from using historical pet we have shown that downscaling can modify the change signal of the gcms e g fig 5 particularly large changes were associated with runoff based on output from sdm and ccam we note that in its full capacity sdm is a daily resolution downscaling method as noted in section 2 1 2 we were unable to use the daily data instead we relied on the monthly data however the analysis of regional annual and seasonal rainfall changes using monthly data fig 2 would be identical if we had used daily data the runoff changes fig 3 are also comparable to recent runoff projections using monthly sdm fiddes and timbal 2017 hope et al 2016 however projected changes to the seasonal runoff in section 3 3 and particularly the rainfall and runoff metrics in section 3 4 would almost certainly be different using the daily downscaled data it is unclear whether wrf modifies the change signal of the gcm as well as we were not able to assess this against the cmip5 model ensemble change signals wrf using gcms from the cmip3 archive in this study we have not examined processes and methodology of the statistical and dynamical downscaling methods as such we are unable to state definitively the reason for the wetter or drier change signals in the different downscaling methods and indeed this may be a feature of the downscaling method in that they are correctly resolving subgrid processes this is a direction for future research which would require an in depth understanding of the biases and sub grid processes unique to each method with respect to sub setting gcms based on model skill recent research hope et al 2016 grose et al 2016 has examined the question of whether excluding gcms that are poor at producing climate characteristics relevant to victoria s climate it was found that many of the poorer performing gcms were underestimating the drying change signal seen for victoria and that sub setting the gcm ensemble in this way would produce drier projections future research and downscaling assessments could utilise these results to provide a more representative change signal for victoria and south eastern australia note however that the gcm selection for sdm nhmm and ccam see section 2 1 was not based on model performance criteria but by and large data availability in the host gcms climate projections contain uncertainties from many sources not only downscaling but uncertainty due to climate scenario model ensemble internal variability and rainfall runoff model and parameterisation kay et al 2009 chen et al 2011 bürger et al 2013 ahn et al 2016 characterising the contributions of all relevant sources of uncertainty is outside the scope of this paper due to inadequate sample representation of the different modelling stages but some qualitative assessments can be elucidated from our results csiro and bureau of meteorology 2016 illustrated the temporal change in the relative contribution of key sources of uncertainty for regions of australia following the method described in hawkins and sutton 2009 for southern australia and the time slice considered here approximately 50 years into the future the response uncertainty model ensemble spread due to response to changing emissions is larger than scenario uncertainty ensemble spread due to applied emission scenario and comparable to uncertainty from internal variability ensemble spread due to models simulation of internal natural climate variability as the projection window extends further into the future scenario uncertainty becomes relatively more pronounced bias correction can potentially be another source of uncertainty particularly for runoff teng et al 2015 whereas the relationships between atmospheric variables and precipitation fields in the statistical downscaling models used here are effectively constrained by observed rainfall rainfall from the dynamical downscaling models are not constrained by observations necessitating bias correction development of bias correction methods that properly correct precipitation for runoff modelling is a subject of ongoing research there are rigorous methods in the literature for the partitioning of uncertainty such as applying an anova type approach to decomposing the total variability in change signals into variability from gcm ensemble climate scenarios and downscaling bias correction e g bürger et al 2013 woldemeskel et al 2014 sunyer et al 2015 this approach is not applicable to our ensemble because of the different gcm downscaling combinations table 1 however total variability in for example mean annual runoff fig 4 appears to be approximately evenly split between variability from gcm model ensemble and downscaling method this is comparable to previous studies which found uncertainty from downscaling is somewhat less than uncertainty from gcm models but is greater than uncertainty from different rainfall runoff models chiew et al 2010 teng et al 2012b we conclude that different downscaling methods have significant effects on change signals in rainfall and runoff for southeast australia comparable but slightly less than the effect from the gcm ensemble scenario uncertainty becomes more important further into the future due to the cumulative impact of increasing emission concentrations in the atmosphere 5 conclusions in the absence of comprehensive downscaling ensembles based on statistical and dynamical downscaling empirical scaling has been generally recommended and often used for regional future water availability assessments in south eastern australia the method is robust relatively easy to use computationally less expensive and typically produces responses lying between other downscaling methods however the method is restrictive in terms of end user requirements and expectations who are interested in questions about changes to extreme high and low rainfall and runoff events and seeking information on within catchment and smaller scale spatial variability of the change signal we examined five alternative downscaling methods available for south eastern australia at the present time consistent with previous downscaling assessments e g chiew et al 2010 frost et al 2011 the change signals for rainfall and runoff arising from empirical scaling lie between those from the other methods the statistical downscaling methods sdm and nhmm produced drier change signals and the dynamical downscaling methods wrf and ccam produced wetter change signals in terms of mean annual and seasonal changes to rainfall and runoff although there is a large degree of uncertainty the reductions in rainfall and runoff in son and to a lesser extent jja appear to be relatively consistent across the downscaling methods and this is consistent too with current understanding of recent and future climate trends in the region hope et al 2017 the results for extreme rainfall and runoff metrics show significantly more differences among the downscaling methods although empirical scaling is unable to provide meaningful information on changes to rainfall sequencing i e wet dry day occurrences by defining a dry day as one with a non zero but insignificant amount of rainfall e g 1 mm changes to dry days and dry spells under empirical scaling appeared to be very similar to those from downscaling methods that do alter the sequencing of rainfall however other metrics that rely to a larger extent on the sequencing of rainfall events e g 3 day maximum rainfall cannot be adequately modelled with empirical scaling year to year variability in annual rainfall is projected to be slightly larger in the far future time period under non scaling methods although uncertainty in this signal remains challenging there was reasonable agreement among downscaling methods on the likely changes to low flow metrics but only for high runoff catchments this is due to low flow metrics being more difficult to measure and model compared to high and moderate flows particularly for drier catchments in this analysis changes to rainfall extremes and to a lesser extent changes to high runoff metrics are largely related to changes to mean rainfall this gives confidence in the predictability of these metrics under different downscaling methods noting that large differences in downscaled mean rainfall across south eastern australia reduce any confidence level attributed to the projected change in high rainfall and runoff in this region we also stress that where specific rainfall or runoff metrics are important for an application we recommend choosing the metrics models and downscaling methods carefully to be able to make meaningful statements about probable or likely changes to these metrics there is potential added value from statistical and dynamical downscaling methods in providing increased spatial information on future change signals both sdm and wrf provide output on resolutions that resolve within catchment
