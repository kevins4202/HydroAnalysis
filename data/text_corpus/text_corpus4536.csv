22680,a purpose built device was designed to obtain high quality experimental fluid dynamics efd data of ship roll decay motions initially then a model experiment was conducted for a slender ship using the proposed device with an accurate optical fibre gyroscope a few important remarks on efd were derived through analyses of the measured data furthermore unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations of the ship roll decay were performed and compared with the results of efd based on the comparisons a few remarks on the requirements for cfd were derived those should be considered in the development of guidelines annexed to the second generation intact stability criteria sgisc discussed at international maritime organization keywords roll decay efd cfd validation uncertainty sgisc 1 introduction in the second generation intact stability criteria sgisc under the development at the international maritime organization imo the roll damping estimation that is required to assess vulnerability of ships to a few of the dynamic stability failure modes imo 2015 is a critical issue an existing formula so called ikeda s simplified method kawahara et al 2011 is available for this purpose in the current draft however it does not always give enough accuracy and there is a limit of its applicable range in the already agreed framework of the sgisc computational fluid dynamics cfd can be used as an alternative to the existing formula as well as a model experiment imo 2016 as for the use of cfd for regulatory purposes a quantitative validation of cfd codes is required to guarantee their numerical results in this regard intensive studies are necessary to derive a standard procedure to obtain high quality experimental fluid dynamics efd data that can be utilised for the quantitative validation of cfd simulation codes moreover a standard procedure for the appropriate use of cfd for roll damping estimation annexed to the sgisc is required which might be similar to the ittc recommended procedures and guidelines ittc 2011 the major experimental techniques for roll damping estimation are roll decay forced roll and excited roll tests ittc 2017 a roll decay test is the most common and widely used technique to obtain roll decaying motions in calm water recently more advanced experimental techniques categorised as the forced roll test and the excited roll test were reported hashimoto and umeda 2010 wassermann et al 2016 oliva remola et al 2018 however they require a mechanical system for giving or arising roll motions therefore a roll decay test is still the most important experimental method for the estimation of roll damping even though the roll decay test can be carried out easily it requires a scaled ship model with this regard cfd techniques can be applied as an alternative to the physical model experiments there are several investigations using 3 d cfd along this line e g min et al 2016 kianejad et al 2018 wassermann et al 2019 in this study a purpose built device was designed and constructed to obtain high quality efd data of roll decay motions for the quantitative validation of cfd methods then a model experiment was conducted for a slender ship known as the onr flare using the proposed device with a top quality optical fibre gyroscope through analyses of the measured data of roll decay at zero forward velocity a few important remarks on efd methods and efd analysis are derived furthermore we simulated roll decay motions of the subject ship using an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans cfd solver with an overset grid technique the cfd simulation is performed under the same conditions as the model experiment so that time histories of roll decay can be directly compared with efd results the cfd simulations are also used to discuss the degree of freedom dof of ship motion to be solved in cfd computation this is an important point to be described in the guidelines of cfd simulation of roll decay test for those who want to use cfd methods as an alternative to a physical model experiment to estimate the roll damping in the sgisc 2 model experiment 2 1 subject ship to develop guidelines of efd and cfd for roll decay tests to be annexed to sgisc it is reasonable to select a slender ship as the subject ship because slender ships are prone to suffer stability failures owing to their relatively small stability in this study a displacement type slender body ship so called the onr flare widely used for recent stability researches was selected as the subject ship principal particulars of the subject ship are listed in table 1 this ship has a twin propeller and twin rudder system in the model experiment all appendages except for propellers are attached to be like the actual conditions details of the ship hull and appendages can be seen in fig 1 2 2 experimental setup a model experiment of roll decay was conducted at the marine dynamic basin of national research institute of fisheries engineering nrife first the height of ship hull at a p midship and f p positions were measured to confirm that no difference from 3 d cad data exists then the design draught was carefully adjusted using four draft gauges considering comparisons with cfd it is important to set the exact water line rather than the ship displacement because it has been confirmed in past cfd trials that a significant difference could occur in roll decay motion if the water line is changed this difference becomes significant if a ship has a transom stern and the gap between the transom stern and the water surface is small dummy weights having the same mass as the draught gauges were put on the same position as the draught gauges to keep the same displacement heel and trim as when the draught gauges were on the model tests the ship weight was measured before and after the experiment for each condition to confirm that there was no change in the ship weight during the experiment 2 3 experimental procedure roll decay tests were conducted in a sophisticated manner to obtain the high quality data which can withstand the quantitative validation of cfd in this procedure a concern about the uncertainty via human handling is excluded using a new purpose built device a long aluminium square pipe was attached to the ship model and the total weight and other parameters were adjusted including the attached long pipe then a certain initial heel angle was given to the ship model via the long square pipe as shown in figs 2 and 3 the square pipe can freely move in heave and pitch directions even when being held thus the change of ship attitude owing to the change of underwater ship volume and buoyancy balance is allowed the aluminium metal frame with rollers which give an initial heel angle to the model through the square long pipe can rotate up to 30 and it is possible to repeat the same roll decay test from a fixed angle attitude by using this new apparatus it is possible to reduce the uncertainty due to scattering of initial condition in roll decay tests it is necessary to release the heel constraint momentarily for roll decay tests in the experiment the aluminium frame can be shortly opened by the strong tension of connected rubber rope because the aluminium frame does not go back once opened owing to the remaining rubber tension it does not prevent the ship roll motion at all as the roll energy is consumed during the first swing the square long pipe never reaches the initial angle and never hits the apparatus before the execution of roll decay tests the ship model was towed to the centre of the basin where the wave reflection effect can be ignored and the roll decay test was executed after the state of water surface sufficiently settled down as shown in fig 4 the heel restraint was released and a subsequent roll decay motion was measured with sampling rate of 20 hz by an onboard gyroscope attached to the centre of ship gravity because the measured data are stored in an onboard microcomputer cable handling is not necessary which could adversely affect the roll decay motion it is very important to minimise the zero value drift for roll decay measurement because it is difficult to remove the time dependent zero value shift appropriately the analysis can be quite difficult in our experiment one of most expensive top quality optical fibre gyroscopes ta7546n1205 produced by tamagawa seiki co ltd is used to solve this problem 3 efd results 3 1 roll decay motion for the use of cfd in the sgisc the accuracy of cfd tools needs to be guaranteed by comparing them with a model experiment however this is only required for a standard design loading condition for other possible loading conditions with changes in metacentric height roll moment of inertia draught and trim cfd simulation can be used directly without further experimental validation to confirm the validity of this procedure a model experiment of roll decay was conducted for three different conditions as presented in table 2 cond 1 is a full load condition as the standard condition which was decided with the reference to a past free running model experiment umeda et al 2014 cond 2 has high gm value 1 5 times as large as cond 1 but with the same draught cond 3 has the same gm as cond 1 but smaller draught about 10 smaller than the full load condition the initial heel angle should be large enough in roll decay tests but not too large whereby water on deck happens so 18 7 degrees of initial heel was chosen for this study at the inclining test for gm measurement a ballast weight on the upper deck was moved from the centreline to port and starboard directions the weight was moved by two steps in each direction the gm value was obtained as the result of a linear curve fitting for six inclined angles including two times zero measurement to reduce the error by practitioners two individuals did the inclination test independently and the average value of two measurements was used as the final gm value the ballast weight used for the inclination test was 500 g and the weight was moved by 25 mm pitch and appropriate moving distances were decided so that 1 of heel was sandwiched by the two steps the heel angle was measured by an onboard gyroscope with no signal and power supply cables and the time average value of heel angle was used for the gm analysis in case the heel angle is beyond 1 5 the gm value of the subject ship does not increase linearly with respect to the moving distance owing to the nonlinearity of gz curve therefore 1 0 was used as the reference value for the gm measurement first the repeatability of a roll decay test using the new apparatus was checked by repeating the roll decay test from the same initial heel angle the comparison between measured roll decay motions starting from the port side port 1 2 and the starboard side starboard 1 2 are shown in fig 5 the two curves were independently obtained and perfectly coincided with each other this high repeatability implies that the uncertainty of the initial condition can be well excluded the symmetricity was also confirmed as shown in fig 6 a result of uncertainty analysis for the peaks of roll decay motion is shown in fig 7 here four trials in total two each for port side and starboard side initial heel are used for the analysis assuming a standard normal distribution for each peak the measured roll decay motions for three different loading conditions are drawn together in fig 8 because the subject ship has large bilge keels and several large size appendages the damping rate is relatively large as compared with a general cargo ship the roll period of each condition at approximately 5 is presented in table 3 the decrease of roll period from cond 1 to cond 2 is inversely proportional to square root of gm as well known the roll period of cond 3 is same as cond 1 even with the different draught for this ship although the gm and draught values significantly differ among the three conditions the difference of roll angle decrement for each swing seems to be very small this fact implies that the accuracy of the roll decay tests must be high enough to be able to measure such a small difference which is essential for the quantitative validation of cfd 3 2 extinction curve the extinction curve is conventionally used to estimate roll damping coefficients from measured roll decay motions the estimation procedure can be found in literature e g imo msc 1 circ 1200 2006 the extinction curve for all conditions are presented in fig 9 for the drawing of these figures the initial heel angle is included as the 0th peak value as a result the extinction curves do not increase monotonously with respect to mean swing and thus it is difficult to approximate the values using a conventional 2nd order polynomial curve it is evident that the first several half swings are regarded as abnormal because the roll decay starts from the state of rest at a certain initial heeling angle in normal decay motions the angular acceleration is not zero at each peak value in addition it is pointed out that the drag force on bilge keels depends on the number of half swings in the transient state katayama et al 2011 therefore several analyses of extinction curves shown in table 4 were attempted to eliminate the inappropriate data for the analysis here the peak of each half swing data was removed in order from the 0th swing to 3rd swing the extinction curves of each analysis are shown in fig 10 here the approximation curve with linear and quadratic terms is drawn together these figures demonstrate that analysis 1 and analysis 2 are not appropriate in terms of curve fitting so the 0th and 1st half swing should be removed in the analysis of roll extinction curves the difference in analysis 3 and analysis 4 is not so significant as compared with previous cases to highlight this point the extinction curves of each analysis are extrapolated to a large swing angle as shown in fig 11 the error of analysis 3 and analysis 4 is about 13 7 at the mean swing angle of 20 this is not a negligibly small error so we need to judge which result is more appropriate for this judgement a roll decay test from a large heel angle is necessary however it would result in a similar conclusion because the 0th and 1st half swings which have very large decrement of swing angle when started from large heel angle need to be eliminated as already discussed to conclude this discussion a forced roll test at large roll amplitude is expected although it is true that a forced roll test giving pure roll motion is slightly different from the real ship motion during roll sway roll or heave roll the coupling effect on roll damping might be relatively small at a large heel angle where wave making and eddy making components are dominant 3 3 comparison with conventional method lastly the influence of human intervention is investigated by comparing the measured roll decay motion using the purpose built apparatus and those performed by human handling the roll decay tests were conducted by two people for two times each so the total number of tests is same as that by the purpose built apparatus the roll time history with the 95 confidence interval of peaks is shown in fig 12 together with the extinction curve the confidence interval of peaks in time history seems to be not so large compared to the result in fig 7 while there are significant difference of uncertainty in the extinction curve nevertheless the 1st and 2nd order coefficients of fitting curve are quite similar to each other therefore it can be concluded here that the difference in roll time history and extinction curve is sufficiently small from a practical viewpoint so that the conventional method by human handling can be used for roll decay tests 4 cfd results 4 1 cfd solver and grids for the accurate prediction of friction and eddy making components which are major components of roll damping at low speed the cfd approach solving the navier stokes equation which is the momentum equation of viscous flow is straightforward compared with conventional potential flow theories with empirical methods an urans solver cfdship iowa v4 5 carrica et al 2007a 2007b huang et al 2008 is used for this purpose the latest applications of cfdship iowa can be found in literature stern et al 2015 cfdship iowa solves the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for the liquid phase of a free surface flow the equations are discretized in space with a finite difference approach cfdship iowa is a block structured overset cfd solver designed for applications in naval architecture problems using either absolute or relative inertial non orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems for arbitrarily moving control volumes turbulence models include the bended k ε k ω based isotropic and anisotropic rans and des approaches with near wall or wall functions a single phase level set method was used for capturing complex free surfaces carrica et al 2006 2007a the suggar code noack 2007 is used to obtain overset interpolation information between the set of overlapping grids the grids for the cfd test of roll decay are shown in fig 13 the number of grid points is given in table 5 to obtain comparable results by cfd all appendages in the experiment i e skeg bilge keels rudders propeller shafts and shaft brackets are included in cfd the numerical condition and selected models for cfd are listed in table 6 these conditions were used for the urans analysis for the subject ship of onr flare in past studies on the prediction of wave induced hydrodynamic forces yoneda et al 2016 cfdship iowa has a function to give arbitrary prescribed body motion as a moving wall boundary problem in addition it allows to choose the dof of motion solved in cfd therefore appropriate number of dof of ship motion to be solved in cases of the prediction of roll decay motions of ships can be investigated 4 2 roll decay motion roll decay motions corresponding to the efd results of fig 8 are simulated using cfd ship iowa by solving 4 dof of sway heave roll and pitch the influence of dof of ship motion solved in cfd is discussed later although the same kg with efd should be used in the cfd calculations the exact kg value is not directly obtained from the inclining test therefore the height of centre of ship gravity used in cfd was determined by repeating the cfd inclining test until an appropriate height providing the same heel angle with efd was found for each condition in general it is difficult to measure the moment of inertia in air hence the moment of inertia for cfd calculations was determined by trial and error which provides the same natural roll period with the efd result in small amplitude ranges where the linearity of stability curve is guaranteed the comparison of roll decay motions for three loading conditions cond 1 to cond 3 between efd and cfd are shown in fig 14 in the standard condition cond 1 the cfd result shows good agreement in terms of roll decay rate the agreement worsens to an extent in cond 3 the worst agreement between efd and cfd is found in cond 2 where the roll period is faster and the damping rate is smaller than other two conditions the major reason for the disagreement in cond 2 is presumed to be that the used cfd grids are not sufficiently fine for the shorter roll period in which the angular velocity becomes larger in addition the constant time step is used for all conditions i e roll periods more precisely the number of time steps for one roll period is 257 206 and 255 for condition 1 2 and 3 respectively therefore it is preferable that the validation of cfd tools for the roll decay motions is done for the shortest roll period case if the initial heel angle is the same however it could be acceptable to validate the cfd method only for standard loading conditions if the required accuracy is not very high for further discussions an investigation on how much the error of cfd affects the assessment of vulnerability to the dynamic stability failure modes in the sgisc should be carried out 4 3 roll extinction curve the roll extinction curves drawn in fig 15 demonstrate the accuracy of estimated roll damping by cfd the 2nd order polynomial approximation curve is also shown in the figures in the efd results shown in fig 9 the smallest roll damping was found in cond 2 and the same result is obtained from the cfd result next comparisons of the decrement of swing angle between efd and cfd at 10 and 20 of mean swing angle are presented in table 7 which are obtained based on analysis 3 the good agreement is found in cond 1 and the errors are less than 0 5 similarly good agreement is found in cond 2 although the agreement in roll time history is worse than cond 1 the biggest error about 7 73 is found at 10 in cond 3 however the decrement at 20 agrees well this difference of error comes from the degree of coincidence of polynomial curve fitting so the range of mean swing angle should be carefully selected in cases when it is used for regulatory purposes 4 4 influence of dof to discuss the appropriate selection for the dof of ship motion to be solved in cfd for roll decay motions cfd runs solving different dofs of motions are executed for cond 1 starting from the same initial heel angle the test cases are described in table 8 and comparisons among four cases are shown in fig 16 here the 4 dof calculation is same as the cfd result in fig 14 from the result it can be confirmed that 6 dof 4 dof and 3 dof provide similar results on the contrary 1 dof provides a significantly different result which shows much larger decay rate than other three cases therefore we can conclude that it is necessary to solve 3 dof of sway heave roll motions or more dofs for the cfd simulation of roll decay motions this fact also implies that efd should be executed for a condition in which a ship model is free at least in sway heave and roll this is an important point to be included in the guidelines of cfd calculation of roll decay motions annexed to the sgisc 5 conclusions a purpose built device was presented to obtain high quality efd data of roll decay motions a few important remarks regarding the experimental procedure and data analysis technique are derived through analyses of the measured data in addition roll decay motions are predicted by urans simulation which use the same conditions as the efd several important requirements for the cfd calculations and validations are derived as a result in addition degrees of freedom of a ship motion to be solved in cfd was clarified these remarks on efd and cfd of roll decay motions should be considered in the guidelines of alternative use of efd and cfd in sgisc being developed at imo acknowledments this work was

to develop guidelines of efd and cfd for roll decay tests to be annexed to sgisc it is reasonable to select a slender ship as the subject ship because slender ships are prone to suffer stability failures owing to their relatively small stability in this study a displacement type slender body ship so called the onr flare widely used for recent stability researches was selected as the subject

draught was carefully adjusted using four draft gauges considering comparisons with cfd it is important to set the exact water line rather than the ship displacement because it has been confirmed in past cfd trials that a significant difference could occur in roll decay motion if the water line is changed this difference becomes significant if a ship has a transom stern and the gap between the transom stern and the water surface is small dummy weights having the same mass as the draught gauges were put on the same position as the draught gauges to keep the same displacement heel and trim as when the draught gauges were on the model tests the ship weight was measured before and after the experiment for each condition to confirm that there was no change in the ship weight during the experiment 2 3 experimental procedure roll decay tests were conducted in a sophisticated manner to obtain the high quality data which can withstand the quantitative validation of cfd in this procedure a concern about the uncertainty via human handling is excluded using a new purpose built device a long aluminium square pipe was attached to the ship model and the total weight and other parameters were adjusted including the attached long pipe then a certain initial heel angle was given to the ship model via the long square pipe as shown in figs 2 and 3 the square pipe can freely move in heave and pitch directions even when being held thus the change of ship attitude owing to the change of underwater ship volume and buoyancy balance is allowed the aluminium metal frame with rollers which give an initial heel angle to the model through the square long pipe can rotate up to 30 and it is possible to repeat the same roll decay test from a fixed angle attitude by using this new apparatus it is possible to reduce the uncertainty due to scattering of initial condition in roll decay tests it is necessary to release the heel constraint momentarily for roll decay tests in the experiment the aluminium frame can be shortly opened by the strong tension of connected rubber rope because the aluminium frame does not go back once opened owing to the remaining rubber tension it does not prevent the ship roll motion at all as the roll energy is consumed during the first swing the square long pipe never reaches the initial angle and never hits the apparatus before the execution of roll decay tests the ship model was towed to the centre of the basin where the wave reflection effect can be ignored and the roll decay test was executed after the state of water surface sufficiently settled down as shown in fig 4 the heel restraint was released and a subsequent roll decay motion was measured with sampling rate of 20 hz by an onboard gyroscope attached to the centre of ship gravity because the measured data are stored in an onboard microcomputer cable handling is not necessary which could adversely affect the roll decay motion it is very important to minimise the zero value drift for roll decay measurement because it is difficult to remove the time dependent zero value shift appropriately the analysis can be quite difficult in our experiment one of most expensive top quality optical fibre gyroscopes ta7546n1205 produced by tamagawa seiki co ltd is used to solve this problem 3 efd results 3 1 roll decay motion for the use of cfd in the sgisc the accuracy of cfd tools needs to be guaranteed by comparing them with a model experiment however this is only required for a standard design loading condition for other possible loading conditions with changes in metacentric height roll moment of inertia draught and trim cfd simulation can be used directly without further experimental validation to confirm the validity of this procedure a model experiment of roll decay was conducted for three different conditions as presented in table 2 cond 1 is a full load condition as the standard condition which was decided with the reference to a past free running model experiment umeda et al 2014 cond 2 has high gm value 1 5 times as large as cond 1 but with the same draught cond 3 has the same gm as cond 1 but smaller draught about 10 smaller than the full load condition the initial heel angle should be large enough in roll decay tests but not too large whereby water on deck happens so 18 7 degrees of initial heel was chosen for this study at the inclining test for gm measurement a ballast weight on the upper deck was moved from the centreline to port and starboard directions the weight was moved by two steps in each direction the gm value was obtained as the result of a linear curve fitting for six inclined angles including two times zero measurement to reduce the error by practitioners two individuals did the inclination test independently and the average value of two measurements was used as the final gm value the ballast weight used for the inclination test was 500 g and the weight was moved by 25 mm pitch and appropriate moving distances were decided so that 1 of heel was sandwiched by the two steps the heel angle was measured by an onboard gyroscope with no signal and power supply cables and the time average value of heel angle was used for the gm analysis in case the heel angle is beyond 1 5 the gm value of the subject ship does not increase linearly with respect to the moving distance owing to the nonlinearity of gz curve therefore 1 0 was used as the reference value for the gm measurement first the repeatability of a roll decay test using the new apparatus was checked by repeating the roll decay test from the same initial heel angle the comparison between measured roll decay motions starting from the port side port 1 2 and the starboard side starboard 1 2 are shown in fig 5 the two curves were independently obtained and perfectly coincided with each other this high repeatability implies that the uncertainty of the initial condition can be well excluded the symmetricity was also confirmed as shown in fig 6 a result of uncertainty analysis for the peaks of roll decay motion is shown in fig 7 here four trials in total two each for port side and starboard side initial heel are used for the analysis assuming a standard normal distribution for each peak the measured roll decay motions for three different loading conditions are drawn together in fig 8 because the subject ship has large bilge keels and several large size appendages the damping rate is relatively large as compared with a general cargo ship the roll period of each condition at approximately 5 is presented in table 3 the decrease of roll period from cond 1 to cond 2 is inversely proportional to square root of gm as well known the roll period of cond 3 is same as cond 1 even with the different draught for this ship although the gm and draught values significantly differ among the three conditions the difference of roll angle decrement for each swing seems to be very small this fact implies that the accuracy of the roll decay tests must be high enough to be able to measure such a small difference which is essential for the quantitative validation of cfd 3 2 extinction curve the extinction curve is conventionally used to estimate roll damping coefficients from measured roll decay motions the estimation procedure can be found in literature e g imo msc 1 circ 1200 2006 the extinction curve for all conditions are presented in fig 9 for the drawing of these figures the initial heel angle is included as the 0th peak value as a result the extinction curves do not increase monotonously with respect to mean swing and thus it is difficult to approximate the values using a conventional 2nd order polynomial curve it is evident that the first several half swings are regarded as abnormal because the roll decay starts from the state of rest at a certain initial heeling angle in normal decay motions the angular acceleration is not zero at each peak value in addition it is pointed out that the drag force on bilge keels depends on the number of half swings in the transient state katayama et al 2011 therefore several analyses of extinction curves shown in table 4 were attempted to eliminate the inappropriate data for the analysis here the peak of each half swing data was removed in order from the 0th swing to 3rd swing the extinction curves of each analysis are shown in fig 10 here the approximation curve with linear and quadratic terms is drawn together these figures demonstrate that analysis 1 and analysis 2 are not appropriate in terms of curve fitting so the 0th and 1st half swing should be removed in the analysis of roll extinction curves the difference in analysis 3 and analysis 4 is not so significant as compared with previous cases to highlight this point the extinction curves of each analysis are extrapolated to a large swing angle as shown in fig 11 the error of analysis 3 and analysis 4 is about 13 7 at the mean swing angle of 20 this is not a negligibly small error so we need to judge which result is more appropriate for this judgement a roll decay test from a large heel angle is necessary however it would result in a similar conclusion because the 0th and 1st half swings which have very large decrement of swing angle when started from large heel angle need to be eliminated as already discussed to conclude this discussion a forced roll test at large roll amplitude is expected although it is true that a forced roll test giving pure roll motion is slightly different from the real ship motion during roll sway roll or heave roll the coupling effect on roll damping might be relatively small at a large heel angle where wave making and eddy making components are dominant 3 3 comparison with conventional method lastly the influence of human intervention is investigated by comparing the measured roll decay motion using the purpose built apparatus and those performed by human handling the roll decay tests were conducted by two people for two times each so the total number of tests is same as that by the purpose built apparatus the roll time history with the 95 confidence interval of peaks is shown in fig 12 together with the extinction curve the confidence interval of peaks in time history seems to be not so large compared to the result in fig 7 while there are significant difference of uncertainty in the extinction curve nevertheless the 1st and 2nd order coefficients of fitting curve are quite similar to each other therefore it can be concluded here that the difference in roll time history and extinction curve is sufficiently small from a practical viewpoint so that the conventional method by human handling can be used for roll decay tests 4 cfd results 4 1 cfd solver and grids for the accurate prediction of friction and eddy making components which are major components of roll damping at low speed the cfd approach solving the navier stokes equation which is the momentum equation of

free surface flow the equations are discretized in space with a finite difference approach cfdship iowa is a block structured overset cfd solver designed for applications in naval architecture problems using either absolute or relative inertial non orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems for arbitrarily moving control volumes turbulence models include the bended k ε k ω based isotropic and anisotropic rans and des approaches with near wall or wall functions a single phase level set method was used for capturing complex free surfaces carrica et al 2006 2007a the suggar code noack 2007 is used to obtain overset interpolation information between the set of overlapping grids the grids for the cfd test of roll decay are shown in fig 13 the number of grid points is given in table 5 to obtain comparable results by cfd all appendages in the experiment i e skeg bilge keels rudders propeller shafts and shaft brackets are included in cfd the numerical condition and selected models for cfd are listed in table 6 these conditions were used for the urans analysis for the subject ship of onr flare in past studies on the prediction of wave induced hydrodynamic forces yoneda et al 2016 cfdship iowa has a function to give arbitrary prescribed body motion as a moving wall boundary problem in addition it allows to choose the dof of motion solved in cfd therefore appropriate number of dof of ship motion to be solved in cases of the prediction of roll decay motions of ships can be investigated 4 2 roll decay motion roll decay motions corresponding to the efd results of fig 8 are simulated using cfd ship iowa by solving 4 dof of sway heave roll and pitch the influence of dof of ship motion solved in cfd is discussed later although the same kg with efd should be used in the cfd calculations the exact kg value is not directly obtained from the inclining test therefore the height of centre of ship gravity used in cfd was determined by repeating the cfd inclining test until an appropriate height providing the same heel angle with efd was found for each condition in general it is difficult to measure the moment of inertia in air hence the moment of inertia for cfd calculations was determined by trial and error which provides the same natural roll period with the efd result in small amplitude ranges where the linearity of stability curve is guaranteed the comparison of roll decay motions for three loading conditions cond 1 to cond 3 between efd and cfd are shown in fig 14 in the standard condition cond 1 the cfd result shows good agreement in terms of roll decay rate the agreement worsens to an extent in cond 3 the worst agreement between efd and cfd is found in cond 2 where the roll period is faster and the damping rate is smaller than other two conditions the major reason for the disagreement in cond 2 is presumed to be that the used cfd grids are not sufficiently fine for the shorter roll period in which the angular velocity becomes larger in addition the constant time step is used for all conditions i e roll periods more precisely the number of time steps for one roll period is 257 206 and 255 for condition 1 2 and 3 respectively therefore it is preferable that the validation of cfd tools for the roll decay motions is done for the shortest roll period case if the initial heel angle is the same however it could be acceptable to validate the cfd method only for standard loading conditions if the required accuracy is not very high for further discussions an investigation on how much the error of cfd affects the assessment of vulnerability to the dynamic stability failure modes in the sgisc should be carried out 4 3 roll extinction curve the roll extinction curves drawn in fig 15 demonstrate the accuracy of estimated roll damping by cfd the 2nd order polynomial approximation curve is also shown in the figures in the efd results shown in fig 9 the smallest roll damping was found in cond 2 and the same result is obtained from the cfd result next comparisons of the decrement of swing angle between efd and cfd at 10 and 20 of mean swing angle are presented in table 7 which are obtained based on analysis 3 the good agreement is found in cond 1 and the errors are less than 0 5 similarly good agreement is found in cond 2 although the agreement in roll time history is worse than cond 1 the biggest error about 7 73 is found at 10 in cond 3 however the decrement at 20 agrees well this difference of error comes from the degree of coincidence of polynomial curve fitting so the range of mean swing angle should be carefully selected in cases when it is used for regulatory purposes 4 4 influence of dof to discuss the appropriate selection for the dof of ship motion to be solved in cfd for roll decay motions cfd runs solving different dofs of motions are executed for cond 1 starting from the same initial heel angle the test cases are described in table 8 and comparisons among four cases are shown in fig 16 here the 4 dof calculation is same as the cfd result in fig 14 from the result it can be confirmed that 6 dof 4 dof and 3 dof provide similar results on the contrary 1 dof provides a significantly different result which shows much larger decay rate than other three cases therefore we can conclude that it is necessary to solve 3 dof of sway heave roll motions or more dofs for the cfd simulation of roll decay motions this fact also implies that efd should be executed for a condition in which a ship model is free at least in sway heave and roll this is an important point to be included in the guidelines of cfd calculation of roll decay motions annexed to the sgisc 5 conclusions a purpose built device was presented to obtain high quality efd data of roll decay motions a few important remarks regarding the experimental procedure and data analysis technique are derived through analyses of the measured data in addition roll decay motions are predicted by urans simulation which use the same conditions as the efd several important requirements for the cfd calculations and validations are derived as a result in addition degrees of freedom of a ship motion to be solved in cfd was clarified these remarks on efd and cfd of roll decay motions should be considered in the guidelines of alternative use of efd and cfd in sgisc being developed at imo acknowledments this work was

22681,turbulence characteristics were quantified in wave current flow environment under the influence of the side rough walls covered with sand grain and granule roughness and comparison was made with the results for a smooth wall the results supported the wall similarity hypothesis in the outer layer for the flow reynolds number re h 31 360 the wall roughness cases tested here were within the transitional regime flow based on the roughness function or shift of the log region the wall roughness effect on the mean velocity profile was estimated in the wave current flow cases for granule rough wall most of the turbulence scales were reduced turbulent stresses for the rough walls increased with roughness height at the near wall region and collapsed with the results for smooth wall in the outer region further the wall normal stress was greater compared to reynolds shear stress the large scale eddies were observed to be distributed periodically within a broad range of frequencies at the inertial subrange regime as a result the energy cascading mechanisms slowed down for wave current combined flow over rough walls keywords turbulence roughness wave current flow normal stress wavelet analysis 1 introduction understanding the roughness effect is of great importance in a spacious range on many geophysical and industrial flows such as pipe flow river flow inland waterways and artificial waterways understanding the characteristics of wall boundary layer due to different roughness is of engineering curiosity in view of applicability to the flow over ship hulls and airplanes among many others the turbulent boundary layer over a rough surface contains a roughness sublayer within which the individual roughness element directly influence the flow and therefore it is not spatially homogeneous i e time averaged turbulence characteristics are not independent of measuring location at the same mean vertical distance bhaganagar et al 2004 the height of this sublayer depends upon the height of the roughness elements as well as their shape and density distribution placidi and ganapathisubramani 2015 an investigation was presented by nikuradse 1933 focusing on the roughness effect on the mean flow parameters and the wall shear stress effect of roughness on the turbulence structure was studied since the early work of perry et al 1969 ligrani and moffat 1986 and krogstad et al 1992 they were concerned with the production of turbulent energy that occurred near the rough wall i e the level of turbulence intensities and stresses also raupach et al 1991 jimenez 2004 and castro 2007 reported work on rough wall boundary layers they stated that the roughness effect on the wall boundary layer depends on roughness reynolds number k k u ν where k roughness height u shear velocity ν kinematic viscosity and roughness function δ u they showed that roughness effect confined in the inner layer and the outer layer follows similarity over a smooth and rough wall for mean velocity and turbulent structures while some experimental studies of krogstad et al 1992 and keirsbulck et al 2002 showed the roughness effect on the outer layer jimenez 2004 concluded that the wall similarity hypothesis is violated when the relative roughness height k δ 0 02 where δ boundary layer thickness however the higher order moments demonstrate decisive variance among the rough wall and smooth wall in the processes related to the normal fluxes of the shear stresses and turbulence energy bhaganagar et al 2004 further the roughness effect tends to increase the scale of turbulence and vorticity fluctuations at the inner layer and changed the near wall turbulence structures for the wall bounded turbulence the conventional idea is that the surface roughness enhances the near wall turbulence regeneration and thus increases the skin friction jimenez 2004 the effect of roughness on flow was investigated through numerical simulation by briggs et al 2017 they established the growth of complex flow features and eddy near the rough surfaces and reported that the nature of roughness directly drove their characteristics the movement of ships and submarines aquatic organisms and the wind surface interaction produce waves in sea river and other aquatic surfaces wave current interaction arises either following or against the current and energy transported by wave current interaction is an essential area of study the design of coastal structures requires the knowledge on wave current interaction and thus it is of great interest to coastal planners and researchers the coastal structure such as seawalls are constructed with the aim to protect the areas of human habitation from the action of tides waves or tsunamis kamphuis 2010 seawalls may be constructed from various material and thus surface roughness may play a vital role in governing the turbulence characteristics associated close to wall region particularly the energy dissipation and turbulent shear characteristics in order to understand the physical phenomenon arising out of the interaction of wall and wave current interaction in the present study flume based experimentation was performed on understanding the effect of sidewall roughness under the influence of wave current flow environment the present study was focused primarily on how the turbulence stresses act at near wall region when the wave is following the current umeyama 2009 showed the influence of sidewall boundary on the vertical profiles of mean vertical velocity vertical and lateral turbulent intensity and shear stress for only current flow as well as wave ensuing and opposing current the presence of waves amplified the magnitude of turbulent intensities and shear stress considerably near the side wall not much variation was found at a little distance away from the sidewall also kemp and simons 1983 measured the mean velocity just above the mid depth from the bed at different locations from the sidewall and provided a comparison between current alone and wave opposing current cases with varying wave height kemp and simons 1983 and umeyama 2009 both considered smooth sidewall surface in their experiments thus it is pertinent to mention here that the influence of rough sidewall surface on turbulent parameters under the influence of wave and current remain unexplored to understand the physics of the flow over rough surface in wave current interacting environment several investigations had been carried out numerically and experimentally over rough bed surface mathisen and madsen 1996 fredsøe et al 1999 barman et al 2018 kemp and simons 1982 carried out an experiment in a laboratory channel to investigate wave and current interaction on both smooth and rough bed from their results they reported that the mean flow velocity near the bottom wall increased for smooth bed and reduced for rough bed when the wave was introduced with the current the turbulent intensity was found high for rough bed in wave following case and reduced considerably with wave height further the effect of sediment transport process due to nonlinear interaction of wave superimposed on has been discussed in detail in ribberink et al 1994 they concluded that the horizontal sediment fluxes depict a substantial scatter and attributed it to low value of velocity components per wave cycle longo et al 2002 carried out a review study on turbulence statistics in the surf and swash region with wave current coexisting environment under the influence of bottom roughness they concluded that the upper surface fluid bogging down in comparison with the fluid underneath and producing an intense velocity gradient rising toward a shear layer the cascade mechanism in turbulence depend on the assumption that the energy density is disjointed in the domain of wave number and is substituted individual scale of eddies henceforth wavelet analysis performs to reveal these eddies longo 2003 longo 2003 2009 studied laboratory experiment to characterize the property of turbulence for generating pre breaking condition of spilling waves further they used wavelet transform algorithm to decompose the kinetic energy contributions within different spatial and frequencies over the time scale moreover the magnitude of maximum reynolds stress was found to be nearly three times greater for the combined flow in comparison with the current alone case umeyama 2005 2009 investigated the mean velocity of two dimensional 2 d longitudinal and vertical velocity components due to waves and current interaction for both following and opposing waves also reynolds stress for wave following current case was observed to increase rapidly near the bed and decrease with distance from the bed until a change in a sign near the mid depth was observed maximum horizontal turbulent intensity was found close to the bed and it decreased progressively towards the free surface the energy transfer process through the evaluation of wave interacting reynolds stresses and gradients of velocity fluctuation close to the free surface in the wave current environment was studied by hoften and karaki 1976 based on the flume experiment the variation of turbulence intensities and reynolds stress showed notable changes over the rough bed in oscillatory flow the superimposed wave frequency is capable of attenuating the energy containing range of velocity fluctuations near the roughness elements and the large scale eddies are concentrated to the wave frequency recently roy et al 2017 showed that the turbulent eddies within the only current flow are modulated due to a superimposed surface wave moreover the large scale eddies are distributed within the crest region and small scales are distributed in the trough region from the summary based on available literature it may be concluded that most of the investigations were devoted to building up the knowledge on the effect of wall roughness on the turbulence structure for a current alone condition for different roughness scales turbulence intensities and stresses and eddy development near the rough surfaces were quantified in these studies for wave current interacting flow the previous investigations concentrated on understanding the turbulence characteristics due to bottom roughness on the superposition of surface wave on current and thus the effect of sidewall roughness on turbulence characteristics under the influence of wave current induced flow almost remains unexplored it is pertinent to mention here that the side wall does influence the turbulence characteristics of the flow as evident from the literature kemp and simons 1983 umeyama 2009 for further understanding the specific effects on velocity fluctuations and turbulence parameters over rough sidewall surface is required when wave interact with current due to its wide practical implications with particular relevance to coastal structures the present study attempts to provide an improved understanding of the turbulence under the influence of side wall roughness for wave current combined flow to achieve the objectives of the present study we have chosen sand grain and granule rough surfaces for understanding the near wall turbulence characteristics such as turbulent stress eddy scale distribution for wave current flow condition for different wave frequency cases the present results are compared the results of with smooth surface and current alone flow cases from the literature it is expected that the present results will help the coastal planners in the cost efficient design of coastal and offshore structures with the improved understanding of the effect of side wall roughness on turbulence characteristic in wave following current flow condition 2 methodology in the turbulent velocity field the variables are treated as stochastic or random variables based on reynolds decomposition a particular velocity component is decomposed into its mean and its fluctuation the instantaneous longitudinal u transverse v and vertical w velocity components correspond to the x y and z directions respectively the decomposition of the instantaneous velocities are given as 1 u u u v v v w w w here u v and w are the time average velocity and corresponding velocity fluctuations are u v and w respectively in the analysis of flow under the combined wave current interaction it is convenient to decompose the instantaneous velocity component in mean velocity wave induced velocity and turbulent fluctuation velocity the wave induced velocity attributes a periodic nature and it is obtained by subtracting the time averaged velocity u v a n d w from the phase averaged velocity u v and w the expression of phase average velocity can be obtained from umeyama 2005 thus the eq 1 becomes 2 u u u u v v v v w w w w here the wave induced velocity in x direction is given as u u u similarly in y and z directions the wave induced velocities are given by v v v and w w w respectively the obtained mean velocities for different wall surface conditions are normalized by the shear velocity u of the respective wall surface the shear velocity u 0 72 cm s was determined by fitting stream wise mean velocity profile with logarithmic law schlichting 1987 for sidewall hydraulically smooth surface with r squared 0 974 in the range of 0 r 2 1 and is defined as follows 3 u u 2 5 ln 30 y k s here k s 0 032 is equivalent roughness the von karman prandtl equation describes the logarithmic velocity distribution eq 3 and katul et al 2002 suggested that a logarithmic velocity distribution may exist in the inner layer of the rough wall surface however for sand grain and granule rough wall cases shear velocity u 0 86 and 0 95 cm s respectively were calculated using modified clauser chart method perry and li 1990 barman et al 2019 normalized stream wise transverse and vertical mean velocities are as 4 u u u v v u w w u normalized stream wise transverse and vertical turbulent intensity are as 5 i u u 2 u i v v 2 u i w w 2 u normalized reynolds normal stresses and shear stress are given below as 6 u 2 u 2 u 2 v 2 v 2 u 2 and u v u v u 2 3 experiment 3 1 experimental setup experiments were carried out in a tilting flume located at the fluid mechanics and hydraulics laboratory fmhl aerospace engineering and applied mechanics department indian institute of engineering science and technology iiest shibpur india the length width and depth of the channel are 18 3 m 0 6 m and 0 9 m respectively and consist of a test section of length 3 m width 0 6 m and height 0 9 m the test section was 11 m from the upstream of channel where in fully developed flow was obtained barman et al 2016 and the flume walls were of transparent perspex which aided in proper visualization of the flow four perforated baffle walls used in series were placed at the inlet of the channel to ensure uniform flow by the breaking of the large scale turbulent structures two categories of rough walls were experimented in this study the first one was achieved by pasting a layer of sandpaper 60 grit on the side walls of the channel for sand grain rough wall the average peak to trough roughness height k was measured 0 86 mm similar to the study of schultz and flack 2007 the second was prepared by gluing granules of size d 50 3 1 mm in a fabric and the fabric was then pasted on the side walls the test runs were carried out at flow reynolds number re h 31 360 for the three surfaces cases such as the hydraulically smooth wall sand grain and granule rough wall with maintaining a flow depth h 20 0 01 cm by the adjustment of the tailgate to recognize the turbulence properties in the wave current interacting flow for rough wall boundary conditions the wave was superimposed into the current by wavemaker which was placed near the inlet of the flume a 20 cm diameter cylindrical plunger was attached with a connecting rod and it was driven by a motor and gear mechanism the periodic oscillation of the plunger was controlled by the dc variac to get desired wave frequency in the experiment for the details of the fabrication and operation of wavemaker see roy et al 2017 to reduce the wave reflection from tailgate a wave absorber was used near the tailgate the schematic diagrams of the experimental setup are shown in fig 1 3 2 experimental condition the three dimensional instantaneous velocities were sampled at the mid depth of flow in the fully developed region by the side looking 16 mhz micro acoustic doppler velocimeter adv at 40 hz sampling frequency rate the instrument operates based on doppler shift effect the transverse profiles of instantaneous velocity were measured with the closest point from the wall surface being 0 4 cm towards the centerline of the channel where self similarity was obtained the acoustic sensor consists of three acoustic receivers and one acoustic transmitter the adv probe is fully submerged into the flow and the receivers are angled at 30 from the transducer axis and fixing with sample volume 0 09 cm3 which is situated nominally 5 cm below the acoustic transmitter factory calibration of the adv is consigned to be 1 0 of collecting velocity data the sampling volume is oriented around the axis of transmitter beam which is nearly cylindrical shape of a diameter 0 6 cm ceramic of the transmitter lohrmann et al 1994 the wave frequency 0 3 hz and 0 6 hz were generated along the current flow by controlling the oscillation period of the cylindrical plunger the wavelength λ and wave height h w were recorded by a camera at different locations with regular interval of time the digital camera with frame rate 24 frames per second was mainly used in the capturing the progressive wave the window of interest was recorded with a resolution of 1280 720 dpi the camera was focused perpendicular to the perspex side wall of the flume to evaluate the wavelength and wave height the recorded images were used the average wavelength was computed by converting the pixel unit of each images into the metric unit 1 pixel 0 026458 cm and then averaged barman et al 2016 the uncertainty of the averaged wavelength for both wave frequency cases lies within 3 9 the experimental conditions for the present experiment are detailed in table 1 in the present study two different wave frequency f 0 3 and 0 6 hz were induced on current flow wave current following flow cases are referred to as wcf1 and wcf2 for f 0 3 hz and 0 6 hz respectively and the only current flow case as ocf throughout the paper the ratio of λ h w 51 and 31 15 were obtained for wcf1 and wcf2 respectively which are well within the range of λ h w 4 56 as proposed in goda 2000 for actual wave conditions found in nature wave steepness h w λ for both frequencies were much below concerning the limiting criteria 0 14 of wave breaking michell 1893 miche 1944 also it could be represented as k h w 2 0 44 where k 2 π λ is wavenumber toffoli et al 2010 therefore the present wave conditions are a good representation of the natural environment the present experimental wave cases fall in the category of intermediate depth water wave dean and dalrymple 1991 the product of wavenumber k and water depth h defines the regions of shallow water k h π 10 intermediate depth water π 10 k h π and deep water k h π thus it is implied that the mid depth of water channel for the wave induced cases showed dominant effect of the wave where measurements were taken other different flow parameters are given in table 1 moreover in the case of free surface flow air may be entrapped by macro turbulence from the free surface the measurement of flow velocity based on doppler ultrasonic technique may lead to uncertainty due to presence of air bubbles in this regard longo 2006 reported on the strong influence of air bubbles on measured velocity large signal fluctuations or velocity spikes arise due to the presence of bubbles and as a result the data dispersion increases without a correlation to turbulence however in the present study the air bubbles were not observed in the flow moreover prior to statistical and spectral analysis of velocity time series the data were filtered to remove the spikes the raw velocity time series were processed to remove these noises using a phase space threshold despiking technique goring and nikora 2002 also the low signal to noise ratio data 20 and low doppler signal correlations 80 were considered as the cut off value while processing the data by the win adv software figs 2 4 depicts the instantaneous and fluctuating velocity time series for 50s in longitudinal transverse and vertical direction respectively at three different measuring locations of flow depth for current only and two different wave induced cases the overall data quality at z h 0 5 z vertical distance from the bottom and h water depth location were found to be of good quality when compared to the other two locations z h 0 35 and 0 2 from this figure it is interesting to note that the wave energy is capable of modulating the turbulent fluctuations in the entire depth of the flow field this observation suggests that the 3d turbulent eddies are modulated in the different z locations the uncertainty estimation is important to assess the quality of turbulence parameters estimated based on experimental data the errors may arise both due to the limitation of the measurement instrument as well as due to the uncertainty associated with the boundary conditions the following equations were used to estimate the standard error of mean and variance of experimental data sample and are defined as garcia et al 2006 7 s mean 2 s u 2 n meaneff 8 s var 2 2 s u 2 2 n var eff here s u 2 is sample variance of variable u n m e a n e f f t m 2 t x and n var e ff t m t x are the effective sample sizes for the mean and variance where t x and t m are the integral time scale and total sampling time of the signal to approximate the confidence interval and estimate the standard errors of the statistical parameters a computer based bootstrap method is used the moving block bootstrap mbb technique is a common tool for determination of the 95 confidence interval for a particular turbulence parameter the optimum length of block is the essential parameter in mbb technique in this case the optimum length of block is computed following the similar procedure of garcia et al 2006 the generated synthetic turbulent signal following the mbb technique is required to be validated with experimental data pertaining to error variance calculation the synthetic data sets were computed using mbb technique of each 150 s time series stream wise velocity signal for a wide velocity range 10 cm s u 45 cm s the mbb process was functioned to each time signal using 1000 replications the comparison of standard error of sample mean and variance of each synthetic data obtained by mbb technique and experimental data are shown in fig 5 a decent similarity was obtained between mbb and analytical equations to estimate the errors the error values for the turbulent quantities in the present study are 15 and the error bars shown in the respective figures indicate the bound of 95 confidence limit according to long et al 1990 a 2 d flow in the central region of the channel was achieved with the ratio of channel width to flow depth about 2 since in the present study this ratio was 3 it could be ascertained that the 2 d flow was achieved at the central region of the flume and hence the effect of secondary current on the flow was negligible fig 6 depicts that the normalized profiles of longitudinal u transverse v vertical w mean velocities turbulence intensities i u i v and i w and reynolds shear stress u v at the centerline of the flume for both smooth and rough walls cases it is perceived from fig 6a that the stream wise mean velocity profile coincide with each other for smooth and both rough wall cases for transverse and vertical mean velocity fig 6b and c the results follow the similar nature as stream wise direction also the turbulent intensities fig 6 d f and reynolds shear stress fig 6g for smooth and rough wall cases also coincide therefore the fig 6 implies that the flow was free from the secondary current at the central line of the channel and was not affected by the rough wall boundary conditions further normalized stream wise mean velocity profiles along the channel width b are shown in fig 7 for smooth and both rough wall cases in fig 7 the horizontal axis at level zero 0 represents centerline data points of the channel and level 1 and 1 represent the right side wall and left side wall respectively it is clearly seen from fig 7 that the roughness effect on the velocity profile was pronounced at the near wall region while the centerline data showed almost wall similarity profile 4 results and discussions 4 1 probability density function fig 8 a c show the instantaneous stream wise velocity and fig 8 d f show the probability density function pdf of the corresponding velocity fluctuations for smooth sand grain and granule rough wall for current only ocf and wave current flow cases with wave frequencies f 0 3 hz wcf1 and 0 6 hz wcf2 time series data of stream wise velocity for 10 s at near wall region y b 0 02 is plotted in fig 8 a c for the different rough wall and for different wave frequency cases it is observed that the flow dynamics and turbulence properties were modulated significantly for interaction of surface waves fig 8 b c shows that a decrease of wavelength and an increase of wave height occur due to imposition of higher frequency wave on unidirectional flow distribution of pdf is generally used to illustrate the statistical moments of random variables in different fields of scientific applications czernuszenko and rowinski 2008 the pdfs of stream wise velocity fluctuations are calculated similar to barman et al 2018 for the three wall surface cases tested here for both current only flow and interacting wave current flow it is professed from fig 8d that the longitudinal velocity fluctuations maintain gaussian distribution for the only current flow while wave induced flow cases show a bimodal pattern in this case the bimodal feature signifies the sinusoidal nature of flow which was obtained through applied wave frequencies two distinct peaks are observed for wave current combined flow while a sharp peak is obtained for only current flow fig 8d f however the peak values of pdfs reduce for rough walls cases compared to the smooth wall the peak region of pdfs of u become flatter for superimposed wave frequencies which signify the dominance of large scale stream wise velocity fluctuations for the rough wall it may be due to the near wall shear stress which acts as a reagent for production of vortices large scale fluctuations due to the rough wall and these vortices enhance the random velocity fluctuating scale further it is observed that for the higher wave frequency f 0 6 hz the velocity fluctuations are distributed in a wide range compared to lower frequency f 0 3 hz 4 2 mean velocity the log law provides the mean velocity profile in the inner region of the smooth wall turbulent boundary layer and is given as 9 u 1 κ ln y u ν c here κ 0 41 is the von karman constant and c 5 5 is the intercept for the smooth wall the effect of the roughness on the mean velocity profile is understood by downward shift of the profile in comparison to a smooth wall the downward shift is quantified as roughness function δ u therefore eq 9 modified for the rough wall cases is given as 10 u 1 κ ln y u ν c δ u the mean velocity profiles in the inner region for smooth and rough walls for the current only case are shown in fig 9 the inner mean velocity profiles for the sand grain and granule rough surfaces display linearity in the log scale the velocity profile for sand grain and granule roughness shifted by δ u 2 2 and 3 1 respectively in comparison to the smooth side wall it occurred apparently due to increase in roughness height according to the nikuradse 1933 clauser 1954 perry et al 1969 and raupach et al 1991 the rough wall boundary condition affected the mean velocity distribution in the inner region however the roughness function δ u depends on suitable scaling parameters such as surface texture townsin et al 1981 roughness density dvorak 1969 roughness slope musker 1980 in the same rough walls when the wave was induced with current the mean velocity was further shifted downward compared to current only flow and is shown in fig 10 in the wave current interacting flow at a frequency f 0 3 hz the value of roughness function is δ u 3 8 and 5 for sand grain and granule roughness wall cases fig 10a similarly for wave frequency 0 6 hz case the value of δ u is 4 and 5 4 for sand grain and granule roughness respectively fig 10b the roughness function for both the wave frequencies is higher nearly 40 50 compared to current only flow therefore it might be concluded that the shift of mean velocity profile apart from roughness height it also dependent on wave frequency and for higher wave frequency the roughness function increases furthermore earlier study on the different rough walls nikuradse 1933 schultz and flack 2003 2005 2007 2009 flack et al 2007 and present experimental data over sand grain and granule roughness are plotted in fig 11 for comparison it is observed from fig 11 that the present data over sand grain and granule roughness is well matched with the previous research works the effect of irregular surface roughness on turbulent boundary layer characteristics expressed as roughness function depends on roughness height information a predictive correlation based on roughness height defined as k k u ν is known as roughness reynolds number howell and beherends 2006 there are three flow regimes namely hydraulically smooth transitional and rough flow based on roughness reynolds number these regimes are defined usually as k 5 hydraulically smooth flow 5 k 70 transitional flow and k 70 rough flow here in the present study hydraulically smooth flow k 2 3 was obtained for flat sidewall and transitional flow k 7 4 and 29 45 for sand grain and granule roughness cases and is also evident from fig 11 it is important to note that the viscosity no more could damp the effect of the turbulent eddies generated from the roughness elements whereas the form drag and the viscous drag on the elements contribute to the overall skin friction flack and schultz 2014 they also concluded that the roughness function follows linear asymptote with the increase in the value of k in the fully rough regime 4 3 turbulence stresses fig 12 and fig 13 depict the normalized turbulence normal stresses in stream wise and wall normal lateral directions respectively for only current flow and wave current following flow for frequencies f 0 3 and 0 6 hz for smooth wall sand grain and granule rough wall cases in fig 12 a the normalized stream wise reynolds normal stress u 2 for the smooth and rough walls cases for only current flow are presented and shows good match with the previous research works flack and schultz 2014 schultz and flack 2007 keirsbulk et al 2002 at the outer regions of the boundary layer where the effect of roughness was not evident whereas near the side wall y b 0 1 the u 2 values are significant for the rough walls fig 12a the peak value of u 2 is observed close to the wall and it gradually decreased with the increase in distance from the wall the normalized magnitude of reynolds normal stress for a smooth wall was primarily high due to viscous effect and was associated with the vortical structures grass 1971 for the rough wall cases the magnitudes were considerably lower than the smooth wall case at near wall region y b 0 04 the reduction of the magnitude was possibly due to the breakup of stream wise vortices by wall roughness elements and it extended as the wall roughness increased fig 12 b d show the differences of u 2 and u 2 normalized mean phase averaged with the addition of waves on current for the three wall surfaces cases smooth sand grain rough and granule rough the effect of side wall in wave current combined flow wcf1 resulted in the reduction of their magnitudes by 1 2 1 8 times than the only current flow for smooth wall case at the region close to the wall region y b 0 2 and for y b 0 2 the magnitude of the difference varied within 1 1 1 2 times further increase of the wave frequency wcf2 resulted in a similar pattern as that of the wcf1 case but with a reduced magnitude umeyama 2009 reported the variation of dimensionless turbulent quantities by taking vertical profiles at different distances from the side wall at the mid depth location the turbulent quantities for wave current combined flow were lower than only current flow throughout the transverse profile it was also reported that the influence of the sidewall extends about 5 cm from the wall in the present study the influence of the sidewall was observed about up to 7 cm from the side wall for the rough wall boundary cases the roughness length scale enlarged by the addition of waves in current flow and turbulence features were controlled by the periodic formation of vortices eddies kemp and simons 1982 further it is observed from roy et al 2017 that the large scale eddies within the only current flow field were modulated by the superimposed surface wave energy the vortices produced by wall roughness and wave current interaction resulted in the increase of the magnitude of stresses at wall adjacent region y b 0 05 which is within six times of the roughness height fig 12c and d the roughness effect is negligible away from the wall normalized lateral reynolds normal stresses v 2 are shown in fig 13 and results show that the roughness effect on current flow fig 13a show good agreement with earlier research works of schultz and flack 2003 2007 perry and li 1990 ligrani and moffat 1986 flack and schultz 2014 and many more the roughness effect on v 2 was found within y b 0 05 and the outer layer showed the wall similarity experimental data indicates that the values of v 2 for granule roughness are 1 13 1 43 times larger than smaller roughness height of sand grain roughness and smooth surface in the region y b 0 03 large roughness elements have large perturbation to the boundary layer which generates large turbulent fluctuation and small scale eddies near the roughness peaks jacobi and mckeon 2011 the large scale eddies containing higher energy associated with a smooth wall break down into small scale eddies for rough wall cases and it supported by power spectral density analysis of stream wise velocity component at y b 0 02 fig 15a the wall normal velocity fluctuations are almost zero at y 0 for the smooth wall on the rough walls y 0 location lies between the roughness crest and troughs where the wall normal velocity may be exist schultz and flack 2007 the developed turbulent fluctuations at near wall region gradually diminish with the distance from the wall thus no effect is observed near the centerline of flume fig 13a raupach 1981 reported that outside the roughness sublayer the normalized stresses are universal in the present study the scatter plot of v 2 fig 13a for smooth and rough surface deviated 2 10 at few measured locations outside the roughness sublayer and this may be related to experimental error the mean phase averaged lateral reynolds normal stress v 2 for wave current combined flow wcf1 and wcf2 in comparison with ocf for smooth wall case fig 13b shows similar nature as that of u 2 fig 12b beyond y b 0 1 with lesser magnitude since the wave induced velocity fluctuations in y direction are almost zero hence the values of v 2 for wave current interacting flow overlap with v 2 for only current flow at far wall region fig 13 b d fig 14 show the normalized reynolds shear stress u v a n d u v for only current flow ocf and wave current interacting flow for frequencies f 0 3 hz wcf1 and 0 6 hz wcf2 for the smooth wall sand grain and granule rough wall cases it is seen from fig 14a that the reynolds shear stress u v for smooth and rough wall cases are almost similar in nature in the outer layer differences are observed by close scrutiny at the near boundary wall region y b 0 1 where u v for granule rough case is 1 1 1 4 times larger than the smooth wall and for the sand grain rough case the same is 1 05 1 18 times larger from the attached eddy hypothesis hierarchies of attached coherent eddies lean in the stream wise direction at a fixed angle which are responsible for producing mean flow vorticity and reynolds shear stress distribution perry et al 1990 also can result in the production of span wise vorticity perry et al 1994 these eddies evolve in a stretching process with time and develop smallest to largest hierarchies where largest hierarchies are assumed to be the boundary layer thickness perry et al 1990 marusic and monty 2019 these hierarchies of attached eddies also exist over rough wall surface similar to a smooth surface only the difference is to scale the smallest hierarchies by roughness scale thus the mutual interaction of both the vorticity generated due to attached eddies and rough surface results in the overall increment of shear stress near the rough wall region for ocf fig 14a the influence of sidewall boundary on u v can be seen within y b 0 06 region fig 14 b d while wave is induced with the current it is clearly found that the wave induced reynolds stresses have a significant effect in the wave dominated region not much variation was observed with increased distances from the wall after y b 0 2 for smooth and rough wall cases the peak location of u v shifted to the side wall with increasing wave frequency the vortices produced due to wave and wall boundary condition interacted with each other at the region adjacent to the wall as a result close to the wall region y b 0 05 the shear stress increased for wave current flow compared to the only current flow the shear stress increases about 5 9 and 14 21 for wcf1 and wcf2 respectively compared to ocf case for granule rough case and for the sand grain rough case it is 3 8 wcf1 and 12 18 wcf2 4 4 power spectral density and wavelet analysis power spectral densities psd of stream wise velocity component were evaluated for current only flow and interacting wave current flow over smooth and rough side wall the psd is generally used to measure the distribution of energy in the signal across the frequency scale power spectral densities psd of stream wise velocity component were evaluated for current only flow and superimposed wave current flow over smooth and rough side wall psd of the longitudinal velocity was executed using fft algorithm after eliminating the possible noise by low pass butterworth filter with cut off frequency 20 hz each of the velocity signals was divided into ensembles of 2048 measurement and hence we obtained 3 ensembles for the measurement at a particular point the power spectral density was estimated at 0 0195 hz intervals with cutoff frequency from 0 to 20 hz with 95 confidence limit using psd algorithm with a rectangular window roy and debnath 2017 fig 15 represents the psd of longitudinal velocity component close to the near wall at three different flow depths for only current flow and wave induced flow cases it was found that the slope at the inertial subrange shows 1 66 for ocf case which signifies conformity with the universal kolmogorov s 5 3 law fig 15 a c show the psd of stream wise velocity across the frequency near the wall y b 0 02 for ocf wcf1 and wcf2 the spectral scaling regimes pope 2000 are observed in fig 15a for ocf over three surfaces it is evident from fig 15a that the large scale eddies are distributed in low frequency range and small scale eddies in a high frequency range moreover comparing the power within the energy containing region in the low frequency range reveals that it is maximum for the smooth wall fig 15a and it decreases with the increase in roughness height this may be due to the presence of large scale eddies near the smooth wall whereas the large scale eddies break down and are converted to the moderate small scale eddies due to the mutual interplay with random spatial distributions of the dome cavity roughness elements and near wall eddies fig 15a further fig 15 b c show the psd for wcf1 and wcf2 respectively over smooth and rough walls a sharp spectral peak is observed at frequencies f 0 3 hz and 0 6 hz for wave current combined flow wcf1 and wcf2 respectively over smooth and rough walls these may be due to the dominance of the wave induced energy at that region similar to roy et al 2018 however an interesting fact is observed in fig 15 b c that other peaks known as harmonics occur roy and debnath 2017 within the inertial subrange regime for all the wave induced cases it is assumed that the large scale eddy dissipated the energy through energy cascading mechanism and converted into the small scales the periodic nature of harmonics probably signifies an intermittent oscillatory nature of the energy cascading mechanism due to the mutual interplay of induced wave energy and wall roughness thus it may be stated that the large scale eddies are distributed periodically within a broad range of frequencies at the inertial subrange regime as a result probably the energy cascading mechanisms slows down for wave current combined flow over rough walls the obtained power spectrum is weighted through the coherent time varying turbulent eddies in the flow field the nature of spectrum shows an exponential decay due to the effect of the time difference in turbulence and that the large eddies extract energy from mean flow further an exponential decay of spectral density for dominating smaller eddy is notably proficient in the dissipation range tennekes and lumley 1972 petti and longo 2001 this spectrum is essential for understanding the ocean wave generation equilibrium and dissipation in the present experiment the context of interest was to explore the character of turbulence for wave current combined flow over different rough wall in a controlled environment it may be noted here that the current investigation deals with the understanding of interaction of small scale flow structures with the different wall roughness based on experimental measurements the spectrum is divided into three different regions such as energy containing region inertial sub region and dissipation region here the turbulent region at the inertial sub range should follow the famous kolmogorov 5 3 law which is different from the slope 4 of equilibrium region the observations and results from this study may be helpful to give a better insight on understanding the interaction of the wave current flow with the river bank and coastal region within the river mouth wavelet analysis simplifies the study of the whole fluctuating velocity signal at distinct scales and locations in space and time domain wavelet transforms portrays the velocity signal in the pseudo frequency f p scale which is removed by decomposing the signal toward flexibly sized time window in the analysis of wavelet the scale to frequency is correlated to analyze the central frequency f c of the wavelet depending on the succeeding relation as 11 f p f c d δ where d and δ represents the scale and sampling period f c is the center frequency f p is the pseudo frequency in unit of hz consisting to the scale d the concept is to relate an exclusively periodic signal of f c with a particular wavelet short time fourier transforms provides the time information while the constant time range window is considered continuous wavelet transforms cwt of a time series s t i is described through a family of wavelet functions e g roy et al 2017 and is defined as 12 ϖ l d 1 d s t i ψ t r d d t here ϖ l and d represents the wavelet coefficient position parameter wavelet scale respectively while the ψ symbols signifies the conjugated value and mother wavelet function wang et al 2016 here the coefficient of wavelet specify the degree of correspondence between wavelet function and signal s t i however an eddy may be enlightened as a function of frequency scale and time duration further the large scale eddy is delineated by the position of the maximum wavelet coefficient value the morlet wavelet is considered to quantify the eddy scales consisting of the magnitudes of the wavelet coefficients roy et al 2017 fig 16 shows the contour of wavelet coefficients in time frequency and space domain for different roughness and wave induced cases to quantify eddies close to the rough wall closest measurement point at y 0 6 cm from the wall was considered for all experimental cases the wavelet coefficients are shown for constant time window time 15000 ms as a function of pseudo frequency and time scale and corresponding raw signals are also presented in fig 16 for wave current induced cases the measured time series data were phase averaged prior to wavelet analysis comparison of fig 16 a d and g ocf case reveal that the maximum energy containing eddies represented by maximum wavelet coefficient are distributed in the time domain at a lower pseudo frequency range 0 3 hz 0 8 hz for all roughness the maximum wavelet coefficients are obtained for flow over the smooth wall than other rough walls this outcome signifies that the large scale eddies are distributed at a lower frequency range near the smooth wall moreover a scrutiny of fig 16 a d and g ocf case suggest a periodic occurrence of large and small scale eddies in the time domain near the granule rough wall fig 16g for ocf case it is observed in fig 16 b e h and fig 16 c f i that the large wavelet coefficients exist within a higher pseudo frequency range 3 hz 10 hz for wave induced cases wcf1 and wcf2 this signifies the large concentration of dissipative eddies in the time domain interaction of wave and current superimposed flow with the roughness breaks down the large scale eddies and convert it to the small scale eddies via energy cascading technique zeff et al 2003 please note that the values of wavelet coefficients in the dissipative range 3 hz 10 hz increased for the sand grain rough wall fig 16e and these further increased for granule wall fig 16h thus it may be noted that the induced wave energy was capable of modulating the eddy scales within the dissipative range furthermore the nonlinear interaction of wave induced eddies and wall roughness produces more dissipative eddies than for the smooth wall case please note that the above observations are valid for all the wave induced cases the only difference is that for higher frequency wave case wcf2 significant periodic occurrences of large and small scale eddies at the lower frequency 0 3 hz 0 7 hz range is reflected it may be due to the fact that the induced surface waves are capable of modulating the distribution pattern of energy containing eddies and these distributions are more prominent when it interacts with the rough side wall fig 12 f and i 5 conclusions the surface wave due to tide or wind energy over current have a strong interaction with the landforms that exists in the coastal region and lower reaches of the river influenced by tide thus the flow dynamics and turbulence structures due to wave current interaction over the side rough wall roughness need to be explored the present study is conducted to explore the mean flow characteristics and turbulence characteristics over rough walls at reynolds number re h 31 360 for sand grain and granule roughness roughness height k 0 86 and 3 1 mm respectively and compare the results with that for smooth wall under the influence of surface waves induced on current only flow moreover the quantification of turbulent eddies and internal structural distributions of the fluctuating velocity components in the near wall region are investigated the main findings from this study are mean velocities within the logarithmic layer near wall region decrease due to the superimposed surface waves roughness function increases for increasing wall roughness heights for only current flow superimposing surface waves the roughness function is larger than that for only current flow thus induced wave frequency can be considered as a suitable scaling parameter for estimating the roughness function the magnitude of u 2 and v 2 reduce after eliminating the wave velocity components for wave current interacting flow over both rough surface cases at far field region of wall y b 0 2 turbulence stresses are greater adjacent to the rough wall probably due to the generation of vortices under the influence of rough wall the reynolds shear stress u v values increase for larger size of roughness elements for only current flow further these values decrease for higher wave frequency close to the wall the roughness effect modulates the magnitude of shear stress however it is less than the lateral stress the large scale eddies are distributed periodically within a broad range of frequencies at the inertial subrange regime as a result probably the energy cascading mechanism slows down for wave current combined flow over rough walls the nonlinear interactions of wave induced eddies and wall roughness produce more dissipative eddies than the smooth wall case moreover the induced surface waves are capable of modulating the distribution pattern of energy containing eddies in the frequency domain and these distributions are more prominent when it interacts with the rough side wall acknowledgment the authors would like to

22681,turbulence characteristics were quantified in wave current flow environment under the influence of the side rough walls covered with sand grain and granule roughness and comparison was made with the results for a smooth wall the results supported the wall similarity hypothesis in the outer layer for the flow reynolds number re h 31 360 the wall roughness cases tested here were within the transitional regime flow based on the roughness function or shift of the log region the wall roughness effect on the mean velocity profile was estimated in the wave current flow cases for granule rough wall most of the turbulence scales were reduced turbulent stresses for the rough walls increased with roughness height at the near wall region and collapsed with the results for smooth wall in the outer region further the wall normal stress was greater compared to reynolds shear stress the large scale eddies were observed to be distributed periodically within a broad range of frequencies at the inertial subrange regime as a result the energy cascading mechanisms slowed down for wave current combined flow over rough walls keywords turbulence roughness wave current flow normal stress wavelet analysis 1 introduction understanding the roughness effect is of great importance in a spacious range on many geophysical and industrial flows such as pipe flow river flow inland waterways and artificial waterways understanding the characteristics of wall boundary layer due to different roughness is of engineering curiosity in view of applicability to the flow over ship hulls and airplanes among many others the turbulent boundary layer over a rough surface contains a roughness sublayer within which the individual roughness element directly influence the flow and therefore it is not spatially homogeneous i e time averaged turbulence characteristics are not independent of measuring location at the same mean vertical distance bhaganagar et al 2004 the height of this sublayer depends upon the height of the roughness elements as well as their shape and density distribution placidi and ganapathisubramani 2015 an investigation was presented by nikuradse 1933 focusing on the roughness effect on the mean flow parameters and the wall shear stress effect of roughness on the turbulence structure was studied since the early work of perry et al 1969 ligrani and moffat 1986 and krogstad et al 1992 they were concerned with the production of turbulent energy that occurred near the rough wall i e the level of turbulence intensities and stresses also raupach et al 1991 jimenez 2004 and castro 2007 reported work on rough wall boundary layers they stated that the roughness effect on the wall boundary layer depends on roughness reynolds number k k u ν where k roughness height u shear velocity ν kinematic viscosity and roughness function δ u they showed that roughness effect confined in the inner layer and the outer layer follows similarity over a smooth and rough wall for mean velocity and turbulent structures while some experimental studies of krogstad et al 1992 and keirsbulck et al 2002 showed the roughness effect on the outer layer jimenez 2004 concluded that the wall similarity hypothesis is violated when the relative roughness height k δ 0 02 where δ boundary layer thickness however the higher order moments demonstrate decisive variance among the rough wall and smooth wall in the processes related to the normal fluxes of the shear stresses and turbulence energy bhaganagar et al 2004 further the roughness effect tends to increase the scale of turbulence and vorticity fluctuations at the inner layer and changed the near wall turbulence structures for the wall bounded turbulence the conventional idea is that the surface roughness enhances the near wall turbulence regeneration and thus increases the skin friction jimenez 2004 the effect of roughness on flow was investigated through numerical simulation by briggs et al 2017 they established the growth of complex flow features and eddy near the rough surfaces and reported that the nature of roughness directly drove their characteristics the movement of ships and submarines aquatic organisms and the wind surface interaction produce waves in sea river and other aquatic surfaces wave current interaction arises either following or against the current and energy transported by wave current interaction is an essential area of study the design of coastal structures requires the knowledge on wave current interaction and thus it is of great interest to coastal planners and researchers the coastal structure such as seawalls are constructed with the aim to protect the areas of human habitation from the action of tides waves or tsunamis kamphuis 2010 seawalls may be constructed from various material and thus surface roughness may play a vital role in governing the turbulence characteristics associated close to wall region particularly the energy dissipation and turbulent shear characteristics in order to understand the physical phenomenon arising out of the interaction of wall and wave current interaction in the present study flume based experimentation was performed on understanding the effect of sidewall roughness under the influence of wave current flow environment the present study was focused primarily on how the turbulence stresses act at near wall region when the wave is following the current umeyama 2009 showed the influence of sidewall boundary on the vertical profiles of mean vertical velocity vertical and lateral turbulent intensity and shear stress for only current flow as well as wave ensuing and opposing current the presence of waves amplified the magnitude of turbulent intensities and shear stress considerably near the side wall not much variation was found at a little distance away from the sidewall also kemp and simons 1983 measured the mean velocity just above the mid depth from the bed at different locations from the sidewall and provided a comparison between current alone and wave opposing current cases with varying wave height kemp and simons 1983 and umeyama 2009 both considered smooth sidewall surface in their experiments thus it is pertinent to mention here that the influence of rough sidewall surface on turbulent parameters under the influence of wave and current remain unexplored to understand the physics of the flow over rough surface in wave current interacting environment several investigations had been carried out numerically and experimentally over rough bed surface mathisen and madsen 1996 fredsøe et al 1999 barman et al 2018 kemp and simons 1982 carried out an experiment in a laboratory channel to investigate wave and current interaction on both smooth and rough bed from their results they reported that the mean flow velocity near the bottom wall increased for smooth bed and reduced for rough bed when the wave was introduced with the current the turbulent intensity was found high for rough bed in wave following case and reduced considerably with wave height further the effect of sediment transport process due to nonlinear interaction of wave superimposed on has been discussed in detail in ribberink et al 1994 they concluded that the horizontal sediment fluxes depict a substantial scatter and attributed it to low value of velocity components per wave cycle longo et al 2002 carried out a review study on turbulence statistics in the surf and swash region with wave current coexisting environment under the influence of bottom roughness they concluded that the upper surface fluid bogging down in comparison with the fluid underneath and producing an intense velocity gradient rising toward a shear layer the cascade mechanism in turbulence depend on the assumption that the energy density is disjointed in the domain of wave number and is substituted individual scale of eddies henceforth wavelet analysis performs to reveal these eddies longo 2003 longo 2003 2009 studied laboratory experiment to characterize the property of turbulence for generating pre breaking condition of spilling waves further they used wavelet transform algorithm to decompose the kinetic energy contributions within different spatial and frequencies over the time scale moreover the magnitude of maximum reynolds stress was found to be nearly three times greater for the combined flow in comparison with the current alone case umeyama 2005 2009 investigated the mean velocity of two dimensional 2 d longitudinal and vertical velocity components due to waves and current interaction for both following and opposing waves also reynolds stress for wave following current case was observed to increase rapidly near the bed and decrease with distance from the bed until a change in a sign near the mid depth was observed maximum horizontal turbulent intensity was found close to the bed and it decreased progressively towards the free surface the energy transfer process through the evaluation of wave interacting reynolds stresses and gradients of velocity fluctuation close to the free surface in the wave current environment was studied by hoften and karaki 1976 based on the flume experiment the variation of turbulence intensities and reynolds stress showed notable changes over the rough bed in oscillatory flow the superimposed wave frequency is capable of attenuating the energy containing range of velocity fluctuations near the roughness elements and the large scale eddies are concentrated to the wave frequency recently roy et al 2017 showed that the turbulent eddies within the only current flow are modulated due to a superimposed surface wave moreover the large scale eddies are distributed within the crest region and small scales are distributed in the trough region from the summary based on available literature it may be concluded that most of the investigations were devoted to building up the knowledge on the effect of wall roughness on the turbulence structure for a current alone condition for different roughness scales turbulence intensities and stresses and eddy development near the rough surfaces were quantified in these studies for wave current interacting flow the previous investigations concentrated on understanding the turbulence characteristics due to bottom roughness on the superposition of surface wave on current and thus the effect of sidewall roughness on turbulence characteristics under the influence of wave current induced flow almost remains unexplored it is pertinent to mention here that the side wall does influence the turbulence characteristics of the flow as evident from the literature kemp and simons 1983 umeyama 2009 for further understanding the specific effects on velocity fluctuations and turbulence parameters over rough sidewall surface is required when wave interact with current due to its wide practical implications with particular relevance to coastal structures the present study attempts to provide an improved understanding of the turbulence under the influence of side wall roughness for wave current combined flow to achieve the objectives of the present study we have chosen sand grain and granule rough surfaces for understanding the near wall turbulence characteristics such as turbulent stress eddy scale distribution for wave current flow condition for different wave frequency cases the present results are compared the results of with smooth surface and current alone flow cases from the literature it is expected that the present results will help the coastal planners in the cost efficient design of coastal and offshore structures with the improved understanding of the effect of side wall roughness on turbulence characteristic in wave following current flow condition 2 methodology in the turbulent velocity field the variables are treated as stochastic or random variables based on reynolds decomposition a particular velocity component is decomposed into its mean and its fluctuation the instantaneous longitudinal u transverse v and vertical w velocity components correspond to the x y and z directions respectively the decomposition of the instantaneous velocities are given as 1 u u u v v v w w w here u v and w are the time average velocity and corresponding velocity fluctuations are u v and w respectively in the analysis of flow under the combined wave current interaction it is convenient to decompose the instantaneous velocity component in mean velocity wave induced velocity and turbulent fluctuation velocity the wave induced velocity attributes a periodic nature and it is obtained by subtracting the time averaged velocity u v a n d w from the phase averaged velocity u v and w the expression of phase average velocity can be obtained from umeyama 2005 thus the eq 1 becomes 2 u u u u v v v v w w w w here the wave induced velocity in x direction is given as u u u similarly in y and z directions the wave induced velocities are given by v v v and w w w respectively the obtained mean velocities for different wall surface conditions are normalized by the shear velocity u of the respective wall surface the shear velocity u 0 72 cm s was determined by fitting stream wise mean velocity profile with logarithmic law schlichting 1987 for sidewall hydraulically smooth surface with r squared 0 974 in the range of 0 r 2 1 and is defined as follows 3 u u 2 5 ln 30 y k s here k s 0 032 is equivalent roughness the von karman prandtl equation describes the logarithmic velocity distribution eq 3 and katul et al 2002 suggested that a logarithmic velocity distribution may exist in the inner layer of the rough wall surface however for sand grain and granule rough wall cases shear velocity u 0 86 and 0 95 cm s respectively were calculated using modified clauser chart method perry and li 1990 barman et al 2019 normalized stream wise transverse and vertical mean velocities are as 4 u u u v v u w w u normalized stream wise transverse and vertical turbulent intensity are as 5 i u u 2 u i v v 2 u i w w 2 u normalized reynolds normal stresses and shear stress are given below as 6 u 2 u 2 u 2 v 2 v 2 u 2 and u v u v u 2 3 experiment 3 1 experimental setup experiments were carried out in a tilting flume located at the fluid mechanics and hydraulics laboratory fmhl aerospace engineering and applied mechanics department indian institute of engineering science and technology iiest shibpur india the length width and depth of the channel are 18 3 m 0 6 m and 0 9 m respectively and consist of a test section of length 3 m width 0 6 m and height 0 9 m the test section was 11 m from the upstream of channel where in fully developed flow was obtained barman et al 2016 and the flume walls were of transparent perspex which aided in proper visualization of the flow four perforated baffle walls used in series were placed at the inlet of the channel to ensure uniform flow by the breaking of the large scale turbulent structures two categories of rough walls were experimented in this study the first one was achieved by pasting a layer of sandpaper 60 grit on the side walls of the channel for sand grain rough wall the average peak to trough roughness height k was measured 0 86 mm similar to the study of schultz and flack 2007 the second was prepared by gluing granules of size d 50 3 1 mm in a fabric and the fabric was then pasted on the side walls the test runs were carried out at flow reynolds number re h 31 360 for the three surfaces cases such as the hydraulically smooth wall sand grain and granule rough wall with maintaining a flow depth h 20 0 01 cm by the adjustment of the tailgate to recognize the turbulence properties in the wave current interacting flow for rough wall boundary conditions the wave was superimposed into the current by wavemaker which was placed near the inlet of the flume a 20 cm diameter cylindrical plunger was attached with a connecting rod and it was driven by a motor and gear mechanism the periodic oscillation of the plunger was controlled by the dc variac to get desired wave frequency in the experiment for the details of the fabrication and operation of wavemaker see roy et al 2017 to reduce the wave reflection from tailgate a wave absorber was used near the tailgate the schematic diagrams of the experimental setup are shown in fig 1 3 2 experimental condition the three dimensional instantaneous velocities were sampled at the mid depth of flow in the fully developed region by the side looking 16 mhz micro acoustic doppler velocimeter adv at 40 hz sampling frequency rate the instrument operates based on doppler shift effect the transverse profiles of instantaneous velocity were measured with the closest point from the wall surface being 0 4 cm towards the centerline of the channel where self similarity was obtained the acoustic sensor consists of three acoustic receivers and one acoustic transmitter the adv probe is fully submerged into the flow and the receivers are angled at 30 from the transducer axis and fixing with sample volume 0 09 cm3 which is situated nominally 5 cm below the acoustic transmitter factory calibration of the adv is consigned to be 1 0 of collecting velocity data the sampling volume is oriented around the axis of transmitter beam which is nearly cylindrical shape of a diameter 0 6 cm ceramic of the transmitter lohrmann et al 1994 the wave frequency 0 3 hz and 0 6 hz were generated along the current flow by controlling the oscillation period of the cylindrical plunger the wavelength λ and wave height h w were recorded by a camera at different locations with regular interval of time the digital camera with frame rate 24 frames per second was mainly used in the capturing the progressive wave the window of interest was recorded with a resolution of 1280 720 dpi the camera was focused perpendicular to the perspex side wall of the flume to evaluate the wavelength and wave height the recorded images were used the average wavelength was computed by converting the pixel unit of each images into the metric unit 1 pixel 0 026458 cm and then averaged barman et al 2016 the uncertainty of the averaged wavelength for both wave frequency cases lies within 3 9 the experimental conditions for the present experiment are detailed in table 1 in the present study two different wave frequency f 0 3 and 0 6 hz were induced on current flow wave current following flow cases are referred to as wcf1 and wcf2 for f 0 3 hz and 0 6 hz respectively and the only current flow case as ocf throughout the paper the ratio of λ h w 51 and 31 15 were obtained for wcf1 and wcf2 respectively which are well within the range of λ h w 4 56 as proposed in goda 2000 for actual wave conditions found in nature wave steepness h w λ for both frequencies were much below concerning the limiting criteria 0 14 of wave breaking michell 1893 miche 1944 also it could be represented as k h w 2 0 44 where k 2 π λ is wavenumber toffoli et al 2010 therefore the present wave conditions are a good representation of the natural environment the present experimental wave cases fall in the category of intermediate depth water wave dean and dalrymple 1991 the product of wavenumber k and water depth h defines the regions of shallow water k h π 10 intermediate depth water π 10 k h π and deep water k h π thus it is implied that the mid depth of water channel for the wave induced cases showed dominant effect of the wave where measurements were taken other different flow parameters are given in table 1 moreover in the case of free surface flow air may be entrapped by macro turbulence from the free surface the measurement of flow velocity based on doppler ultrasonic technique may lead to uncertainty due to presence of air bubbles in this regard longo 2006 reported on the strong influence of air bubbles on measured velocity large signal fluctuations or velocity spikes arise due to the presence of bubbles and as a result the data dispersion increases without a correlation to turbulence however in the present study the air bubbles were not observed in the flow moreover prior to statistical and spectral analysis of velocity time series the data were filtered to remove the spikes the raw velocity time series were processed to remove these noises using a phase space threshold despiking technique goring and nikora 2002 also the low signal to noise ratio data 20 and low doppler signal correlations 80 were considered as the cut off value while processing the data by the win adv software figs 2 4 depicts the instantaneous and fluctuating velocity time series for 50s in longitudinal transverse and vertical direction respectively at three different measuring locations of flow depth for current only and two different wave induced cases the overall data quality at z h 0 5 z vertical distance from the bottom and h water depth location were found to be of good quality when compared to the other two locations z h 0 35 and 0 2 from this figure it is interesting to note that the wave energy is capable of modulating the turbulent fluctuations in the entire depth of the flow field this observation suggests that the 3d turbulent eddies are modulated in the different z locations the uncertainty estimation is important to assess the quality of turbulence parameters estimated based on experimental data the errors may arise both due to the limitation of the measurement instrument as well as due to the uncertainty associated with the boundary conditions the following equations were used to estimate the standard error of mean and variance of experimental data sample and are defined as garcia et al 2006 7 s mean 2 s u 2 n meaneff 8 s var 2 2 s u 2 2 n var eff here s u 2 is sample variance of variable u n m e a n e f f t m 2 t x and n var e ff t m t x are the effective sample sizes for the mean and variance where t x and t m are the integral time scale and total sampling time of the signal to approximate the confidence interval and estimate the standard errors of the statistical parameters a computer based bootstrap method is used the moving block bootstrap mbb technique is a common tool for determination of the 95 confidence interval for a particular turbulence parameter the optimum length of block is the essential parameter in mbb technique in this case the optimum length of block is computed following the similar procedure of garcia et al 2006 the generated synthetic turbulent signal following the mbb technique is required to be validated with experimental data pertaining to error variance calculation the synthetic data sets were computed using mbb technique of each 150 s time series stream wise velocity signal for a wide velocity range 10 cm s u 45 cm s the mbb process was functioned to each time signal using 1000 replications the comparison of standard error of sample mean and variance of each synthetic data obtained by mbb technique and experimental data are shown in fig 5 a decent similarity was obtained between mbb and analytical equations to estimate the errors the error values for the turbulent quantities in the present study are 15 and the error bars shown in the respective figures indicate the bound of 95 confidence limit according to long et al 1990 a 2 d flow in the central region of the channel was achieved with the ratio of channel width to flow depth about 2 since in the present study this ratio was 3 it could be ascertained that the 2 d flow was achieved at the central region of the flume and hence the effect of secondary current on the flow was negligible fig 6 depicts that the normalized profiles of longitudinal u transverse v vertical w mean velocities turbulence intensities i u i v and i w and reynolds shear stress u v at the centerline of the flume for both smooth and rough walls cases it is perceived from fig 6a that the stream wise mean velocity profile coincide with each other for smooth and both rough wall cases for transverse and vertical mean velocity fig 6b and c the results follow the similar nature as stream wise direction also the turbulent intensities fig 6 d f and reynolds shear stress fig 6g for smooth and rough wall cases also coincide therefore the fig 6 implies that the flow was free from the secondary current at the central line of the channel and was not affected by the rough wall boundary conditions further normalized stream wise mean velocity profiles along the channel width b are shown in fig 7 for smooth and both rough wall cases in fig 7 the horizontal axis at level zero 0 represents centerline data points of the channel and level 1 and 1 represent the right side wall and left side wall respectively it is clearly seen from fig 7 that the roughness effect on the velocity profile was pronounced at the near wall region while the centerline data showed almost wall similarity profile 4 results and discussions 4 1 probability density function fig 8 a c show the instantaneous stream wise velocity and fig 8 d f show the probability density function pdf of the corresponding velocity fluctuations for smooth sand grain and granule rough wall for current only ocf and wave current flow cases with wave frequencies f 0 3 hz wcf1 and 0 6 hz wcf2 time series data of stream wise velocity for 10 s at near wall region y b 0 02 is plotted in fig 8 a c for the different rough wall and for different wave frequency cases it is observed that the flow dynamics and turbulence properties were modulated significantly for interaction of surface waves fig 8 b c shows that a decrease of wavelength and an increase of wave height occur due to imposition of higher frequency wave on unidirectional flow distribution of pdf is generally used to illustrate the statistical moments of random variables in different fields of scientific applications czernuszenko and rowinski 2008 the pdfs of stream wise velocity fluctuations are calculated similar to barman et al 2018 for the three wall surface cases tested here for both current only flow and interacting wave current flow it is professed from fig 8d that the longitudinal velocity fluctuations maintain gaussian distribution for the only current flow while wave induced flow cases show a bimodal pattern in this case the bimodal feature signifies the sinusoidal nature of flow which was obtained through applied wave frequencies two distinct peaks are observed for wave current combined flow while a sharp peak is obtained for only current flow fig 8d f however the peak values of pdfs reduce for rough walls cases compared to the smooth wall the peak region of pdfs of u become flatter for superimposed wave frequencies which signify the dominance of large scale stream wise velocity fluctuations for the rough wall it may be due to the near wall shear stress which acts as a reagent for production of vortices large scale fluctuations due to the rough wall and these vortices enhance the random velocity fluctuating scale further it is observed that for the higher wave frequency f 0 6 hz the velocity fluctuations are distributed in a wide range compared to lower frequency f 0 3 hz 4 2 mean velocity the log law provides the mean velocity profile in the inner region of the smooth wall turbulent boundary layer and is given as 9 u 1 κ ln y u ν c here κ 0 41 is the von karman constant and c 5 5 is the intercept for the smooth wall the effect of the roughness on the mean velocity profile is understood by downward shift of the profile in comparison to a smooth wall the downward shift is quantified as roughness function δ u therefore eq 9 modified for the rough wall cases is given as 10 u 1 κ ln y u ν c δ u the mean velocity profiles in the inner region for smooth and rough walls for the current only case are shown in fig 9 the inner mean velocity profiles for the sand grain and granule rough surfaces display linearity in the log scale the velocity profile for sand grain and granule roughness shifted by δ u 2 2 and 3 1 respectively in comparison to the smooth side wall it occurred apparently due to increase in roughness height according to the nikuradse 1933 clauser 1954 perry et al 1969 and raupach et al 1991 the rough wall boundary condition affected the mean velocity distribution in the inner region however the roughness function δ u depends on suitable scaling parameters such as surface texture townsin et al 1981 roughness density dvorak 1969 roughness slope musker 1980 in the same rough walls when the wave was induced with current the mean velocity was further shifted downward compared to current only flow and is shown in fig 10 in the wave current interacting flow at a frequency f 0 3 hz the value of roughness function is δ u 3 8 and 5 for sand grain and granule roughness wall cases fig 10a similarly for wave frequency 0 6 hz case the value of δ u is 4 and 5 4 for sand grain and granule roughness respectively fig 10b the roughness function for both the wave frequencies is higher nearly 40 50 compared to current only flow therefore it might be concluded that the shift of mean velocity profile apart from roughness height it also dependent on wave frequency and for higher wave frequency the roughness function increases furthermore earlier study on the different rough walls nikuradse 1933 schultz and flack 2003 2005 2007 2009 flack et al 2007 and present experimental data over sand grain and granule roughness are plotted in fig 11 for comparison it is observed from fig 11 that the present data over sand grain and granule roughness is well matched with the previous research works the effect of irregular surface roughness on turbulent boundary layer characteristics expressed as roughness function depends on roughness height information a predictive correlation based on roughness height defined as k k u ν is known as roughness reynolds number howell and beherends 2006 there are three flow regimes namely hydraulically smooth transitional and rough flow based on roughness reynolds number these regimes are defined usually as k 5 hydraulically smooth flow 5 k 70 transitional flow and k 70 rough flow here in the present study hydraulically smooth flow k 2 3 was obtained for flat sidewall and transitional flow k 7 4 and 29 45 for sand grain and granule roughness cases and is also evident from fig 11 it is important to note that the viscosity no more could damp the effect of the turbulent eddies generated from the roughness elements whereas the form drag and the viscous drag on the elements contribute to the overall skin friction flack and schultz 2014 they also concluded that the roughness function follows linear asymptote with the increase in the value of k in the fully rough regime 4 3 turbulence stresses fig 12 and fig 13 depict the normalized turbulence normal stresses in stream wise and wall normal lateral directions respectively for only current flow and wave current following flow for frequencies f 0 3 and 0 6 hz for smooth wall sand grain and granule rough wall cases in fig 12 a the normalized stream wise reynolds normal stress u 2 for the smooth and rough walls cases for only current flow are presented and shows good match with the previous research works flack and schultz 2014 schultz and flack 2007 keirsbulk et al 2002 at the outer regions of the boundary layer where the effect of roughness was not evident whereas near the side wall y b 0 1 the u 2 values are significant for the rough walls fig 12a the peak value of u 2 is observed close to the wall and it gradually decreased with the increase in distance from the wall the normalized magnitude of reynolds normal stress for a smooth wall was primarily high due to viscous effect and was associated with the vortical structures grass 1971 for the rough wall cases the magnitudes were considerably lower than the smooth wall case at near wall region y b 0 04 the reduction of the magnitude was possibly due to the breakup of stream wise vortices by wall roughness elements and it extended as the wall roughness increased fig 12 b d show the differences of u 2 and u 2 normalized mean phase averaged with the addition of waves on current for the three wall surfaces cases smooth sand grain rough and granule rough the effect of side wall in wave current combined flow wcf1 resulted in the reduction of their magnitudes by 1 2 1 8 times than the only current flow for smooth wall case at the region close to the wall region y b 0 2 and for y b 0 2 the magnitude of the difference varied within 1 1 1 2 times further increase of the wave frequency wcf2 resulted in a similar pattern as that of the wcf1 case but with a reduced magnitude umeyama 2009 reported the variation of dimensionless turbulent quantities by taking vertical profiles at different distances from the side wall at the mid depth location the turbulent quantities for wave current combined flow were lower than only current flow throughout the transverse profile it was also reported that the influence of the sidewall extends about 5 cm from the wall in the present study the influence of the sidewall was observed about up to 7 cm from the side wall for the rough wall boundary cases the roughness length scale enlarged by the addition of waves in current flow and turbulence features were controlled by the periodic formation of vortices eddies kemp and simons 1982 further it is observed from roy et al 2017 that the large scale eddies within the only current flow field were modulated by the superimposed surface wave energy the vortices produced by wall roughness and wave current interaction resulted in the increase of the magnitude of stresses at wall adjacent region y b 0 05 which is within six times of the roughness height fig 12c and d the roughness effect is negligible away from the wall normalized lateral reynolds normal stresses v 2 are shown in fig 13 and results show that the roughness effect on current flow fig 13a show good agreement with earlier research works of schultz and flack 2003 2007 perry and li 1990 ligrani and moffat 1986 flack and schultz 2014 and many more the roughness effect on v 2 was found within y b 0 05 and the outer layer showed the wall similarity experimental data indicates that the values of v 2 for granule roughness are 1 13 1 43 times larger than smaller roughness height of sand grain roughness and smooth surface in the region y b 0 03 large roughness elements have large perturbation to the boundary layer which generates large turbulent fluctuation and small scale eddies near the roughness peaks jacobi and mckeon 2011 the large scale eddies containing higher energy associated with a smooth wall break down into small scale eddies for rough wall cases and it supported by power spectral density analysis of stream wise velocity component at y b 0 02 fig 15a the wall normal velocity fluctuations are almost zero at y 0 for the smooth wall on the rough walls y 0 location lies between the roughness crest and troughs where the wall normal velocity may be exist schultz and flack 2007 the developed turbulent fluctuations at near wall region gradually diminish with the distance from the wall thus no effect is observed near the centerline of flume fig 13a raupach 1981 reported that outside the roughness sublayer the normalized stresses are universal in the present study the scatter plot of v 2 fig 13a for smooth and rough surface deviated 2 10 at few measured locations outside the roughness sublayer and this may be related to experimental error the mean phase averaged lateral reynolds normal stress v 2 for wave current combined flow wcf1 and wcf2 in comparison with ocf for smooth wall case fig 13b shows similar nature as that of u 2 fig 12b beyond y b 0 1 with lesser magnitude since the wave induced velocity fluctuations in y direction are almost zero hence the values of v 2 for wave current interacting flow overlap with v 2 for only current flow at far wall region fig 13 b d fig 14 show the normalized reynolds shear stress u v a n d u v for only current flow ocf and wave current interacting flow for frequencies f 0 3 hz wcf1 and 0 6 hz wcf2 for the smooth wall sand grain and granule rough wall cases it is seen from fig 14a that the reynolds shear stress u v for smooth and rough wall cases are almost similar in nature in the outer layer differences are observed by close scrutiny at the near boundary wall region y b 0 1 where u v for granule rough case is 1 1 1 4 times larger than the smooth wall and for the sand grain rough case the same is 1 05 1 18 times larger from the attached eddy hypothesis hierarchies of attached coherent eddies lean in the stream wise direction at a fixed angle which are responsible for producing mean flow vorticity and reynolds shear stress distribution perry et al 1990 also can result in the production of span wise vorticity perry et al 1994 these eddies evolve in a stretching process with time and develop smallest to largest hierarchies where largest hierarchies are assumed to be the boundary layer thickness perry et al 1990 marusic and monty 2019 these hierarchies of attached eddies also exist over rough wall surface similar to a smooth surface only the difference is to scale the smallest hierarchies by roughness scale thus the mutual interaction of both the vorticity generated due to attached eddies and rough surface results in the overall increment of shear stress near the rough wall region for ocf fig 14a the influence of sidewall boundary on u v can be seen within y b 0 06 region fig 14 b d while wave is induced with the current it is clearly found that the wave induced reynolds stresses have a significant effect in the wave dominated region not much variation was observed with increased distances from the wall after y b 0 2 for smooth and rough wall cases the peak location of u v shifted to the side wall with increasing wave frequency the vortices produced due to wave and wall boundary condition interacted with each other at the region adjacent to the wall as a result close to the wall region y b 0 05 the shear stress increased for wave current flow compared to the only current flow the shear stress increases about 5 9 and 14 21 for wcf1 and wcf2 respectively compared to ocf case for granule rough case and for the sand grain rough case it is 3 8 wcf1 and 12 18 wcf2 4 4 power spectral density and wavelet analysis power spectral densities psd of stream wise velocity component were evaluated for current only flow and interacting wave current flow over smooth and rough side wall the psd is generally used to measure the distribution of energy in the signal across the frequency scale power spectral densities psd of stream wise velocity component were evaluated for current only flow and superimposed wave current flow over smooth and rough side wall psd of the longitudinal velocity was executed using fft algorithm after eliminating the possible noise by low pass butterworth filter with cut off frequency 20 hz each of the velocity signals was divided into ensembles of 2048 measurement and hence we obtained 3 ensembles for the measurement at a particular point the power spectral density was estimated at 0 0195 hz intervals with cutoff frequency from 0 to 20 hz with 95 confidence limit using psd algorithm with a rectangular window roy and debnath 2017 fig 15 represents the psd of longitudinal velocity component close to the near wall at three different flow depths for only current flow and wave induced flow cases it was found that the slope at the inertial subrange shows 1 66 for ocf case which signifies conformity with the universal kolmogorov s 5 3 law fig 15 a c show the psd of stream wise velocity across the frequency near the wall y b 0 02 for ocf wcf1 and wcf2 the spectral scaling regimes pope 2000 are observed in fig 15a for ocf over three surfaces it is evident from fig 15a that the large scale eddies are distributed in low frequency range and small scale eddies in a high frequency range moreover comparing the power within the energy containing region in the low frequency range reveals that it is maximum for the smooth wall fig 15a and it decreases with the increase in roughness height this may be due to the presence of large scale eddies near the smooth wall whereas the large scale eddies break down and are converted to the moderate small scale eddies due to the mutual interplay with random spatial distributions of the dome cavity roughness elements and near wall eddies fig 15a further fig 15 b c show the psd for wcf1 and wcf2 respectively over smooth and rough walls a sharp spectral peak is observed at frequencies f 0 3 hz and 0 6 hz for wave current combined flow wcf1 and wcf2 respectively over smooth and rough walls these may be due to the dominance of the wave induced energy at that region similar to roy et al 2018 however an interesting fact is observed in fig 15 b c that other peaks known as harmonics occur roy and debnath 2017 within the inertial subrange regime for all the wave induced cases it is assumed that the large scale eddy dissipated the energy through energy cascading mechanism and converted into the small scales the periodic nature of harmonics probably signifies an intermittent oscillatory nature of the energy cascading mechanism due to the mutual interplay of induced wave energy and wall roughness thus it may be stated that the large scale eddies are distributed periodically within a broad range of frequencies at the inertial subrange regime as a result probably the energy cascading mechanisms slows down for wave current combined flow over rough walls the obtained power spectrum is weighted through the coherent time varying turbulent eddies in the flow field the nature of spectrum shows an exponential decay due to the effect of the time difference in turbulence and that the large eddies extract energy from mean flow further an exponential decay of spectral density for dominating smaller eddy is notably proficient in the dissipation range tennekes and lumley 1972 petti and longo 2001 this spectrum is essential for understanding the ocean wave generation equilibrium and dissipation in the present experiment the context of interest was to explore the character of turbulence for wave current combined flow over different rough wall in a controlled environment it may be noted here that the current investigation deals with the understanding of interaction of small scale flow structures with the different wall roughness based on experimental measurements the spectrum is divided into three different regions such as energy containing region inertial sub region and dissipation region here the turbulent region at the inertial sub range should follow the famous kolmogorov 5 3 law which is different from the slope 4 of equilibrium region the observations and results from this study may be helpful to give a better insight on understanding the interaction of the wave current flow with the river bank and coastal region within the river mouth wavelet analysis simplifies the study of the whole fluctuating velocity signal at distinct scales and locations in space and time domain wavelet transforms portrays the velocity signal in the pseudo frequency f p scale which is removed by decomposing the signal toward flexibly sized time window in the analysis of wavelet the scale to frequency is correlated to analyze the central frequency f c of the wavelet depending on the succeeding relation as 11 f p f c d δ where d and δ represents the scale and sampling period f c is the center frequency f p is the pseudo frequency in unit of hz consisting to the scale d the concept is to relate an exclusively periodic signal of f c with a particular wavelet short time fourier transforms provides the time information while the constant time range window is considered continuous wavelet transforms cwt of a time series s t i is described through a family of wavelet functions e g roy et al 2017 and is defined as 12 ϖ l d 1 d s t i ψ t r d d t here ϖ l and d represents the wavelet coefficient position parameter wavelet scale respectively while the ψ symbols signifies the conjugated value and mother wavelet function wang et al 2016 here the coefficient of wavelet specify the degree of correspondence between wavelet function and signal s t i however an eddy may be enlightened as a function of frequency scale and time duration further the large scale eddy is delineated by the position of the maximum wavelet coefficient value the morlet wavelet is considered to quantify the eddy scales consisting of the magnitudes of the wavelet coefficients roy et al 2017 fig 16 shows the contour of wavelet coefficients in time frequency and space domain for different roughness and wave induced cases to quantify eddies close to the rough wall closest measurement point at y 0 6 cm from the wall was considered for all experimental cases the wavelet coefficients are shown for constant time window time 15000 ms as a function of pseudo frequency and time scale and corresponding raw signals are also presented in fig 16 for wave current induced cases the measured time series data were phase averaged prior to wavelet analysis comparison of fig 16 a d and g ocf case reveal that the maximum energy containing eddies represented by maximum wavelet coefficient are distributed in the time domain at a lower pseudo frequency range 0 3 hz 0 8 hz for all roughness the maximum wavelet coefficients are obtained for flow over the smooth wall than other rough walls this outcome signifies that the large scale eddies are distributed at a lower frequency range near the smooth wall moreover a scrutiny of fig 16 a d and g ocf case suggest a periodic occurrence of large and small scale eddies in the time domain near the granule rough wall fig 16g for ocf case it is observed in fig 16 b e h and fig 16 c f i that the large wavelet coefficients exist within a higher pseudo frequency range 3 hz 10 hz for wave induced cases wcf1 and wcf2 this signifies the large concentration of dissipative eddies in the time domain interaction of wave and current superimposed flow with the roughness breaks down the large scale eddies and convert it to the small scale eddies via energy cascading technique zeff et al 2003 please note that the values of wavelet coefficients in the dissipative range 3 hz 10 hz increased for the sand grain rough wall fig 16e and these further increased for granule wall fig 16h thus it may be noted that the induced wave energy was capable of modulating the eddy scales within the dissipative range furthermore the nonlinear interaction of wave induced eddies and wall roughness produces more dissipative eddies than for the smooth wall case please note that the above observations are valid for all the wave induced cases the only difference is that for higher frequency wave case wcf2 significant periodic occurrences of large and small scale eddies at the lower frequency 0 3 hz 0 7 hz range is reflected it may be due to the fact that the induced surface waves are capable of modulating the distribution pattern of energy containing eddies and these distributions are more prominent when it interacts with the rough side wall fig 12 f and i 5 conclusions the surface wave due to tide or wind energy over current have a strong interaction with the landforms that exists in the coastal region and lower reaches of the river influenced by tide thus the flow dynamics and turbulence structures due to wave current interaction over the side rough wall roughness need to be explored the present study is conducted to explore the mean flow characteristics and turbulence characteristics over rough walls at reynolds number re h 31 360 for sand grain and granule roughness roughness height k 0 86 and 3 1 mm respectively and compare the results with that for smooth wall under the influence of surface waves induced on current only flow moreover the quantification of turbulent eddies and internal structural distributions of the fluctuating velocity components in the near wall region are investigated the main findings from this study are mean velocities within the logarithmic layer near wall region decrease due to the superimposed surface waves roughness function increases for increasing wall roughness heights for only current flow superimposing surface waves the roughness function is larger than that for only current flow thus induced wave frequency can be considered as a suitable scaling parameter for estimating the roughness function the magnitude of u 2 and v 2 reduce after eliminating the wave velocity components for wave current interacting flow over both rough surface cases at far field region of wall y b 0 2 turbulence stresses are greater adjacent to the rough wall probably due to the generation of vortices under the influence of rough wall the reynolds shear stress u v values increase for larger size of roughness elements for only current flow further these values decrease for higher wave frequency close to the wall the roughness effect modulates the magnitude of shear stress however it is less than the lateral stress the large scale eddies are distributed periodically within a broad range of frequencies at the inertial subrange regime as a result probably the energy cascading mechanism slows down for wave current combined flow over rough walls the nonlinear interactions of wave induced eddies and wall roughness produce more dissipative eddies than the smooth wall case moreover the induced surface waves are capable of modulating the distribution pattern of energy containing eddies in the frequency domain and these distributions are more prominent when it interacts with the rough side wall acknowledgment the authors would like to

22682,this paper investigates submarine slide pipe interaction through centrifuge tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd with particular focus on the soil flow mechanisms that occur around a suspended pipe at non newtonian reynolds numbers renon newtonian between 0 5 and 40 the centrifuge tests involve horizontal translation of a model pipe in samples of kaolin at different densities and undrained strengths whilst measuring pore pressures at the model pipe front and rear these measurements provide insights into the pressure evolution at these pipe locations with increasing renon newtonian in the cfd simulations the submarine slide is idealised as a single phase non newtonian power law fluid that flows around a two dimensional pipe fully engulfed cfd modelling demonstrates that the drag coefficient depends on both renon newtonian and the power law index controlling the slide material viscous behaviour examination of the observed cfd flow features reveals that slide flow can separate from the pipe surface when renon newtonian 10 it is shown that the renon newtonian at which soil flow separation occurs approximately coincides with increases in the 1 differences in

these results indicate that nh is approximately constant at low renon newtonian before increasing linearly over the renon newtonian range of interest for submarine slides with a slope of 0 5ch for renon newtonian 10 indicating the increased importance of inertial effects although the results shown in fig 1 are relevant to the expected field renon newtonian range of up to 240 zakeri et al 2008 where eq 1 can be fitted to the data and used to estimate the horizontal pressure on a pipe during slide impact the evolving mechanisms of soil flow with increasing renon newtonian has not been systematically investigated for newtonian fluids it is well known that the flow mechanisms around a cylindrical structure changes with increasing renewtonian panton 2006 sumer and fredsøe 2006 see for example fig 2 which in turn alter the forces acting on the pipe it should be noted that renewtonian is defined as renewtonian ρvdpipe μ where μ dynamic viscosity of the newtonian fluid for renewtonian 5 the velocity streamlines remain attached to the pipe surface fig 2a as inertial effects increase at 5 renewtonian 40 fig 2b the loss of kinetic energy as fluid moves around the pipe curvature leads to fluid separation from the pipe surface this leads to the formation of symmetric vortex pairs in the form of recirculation bubbles at the pipe rear here the pressure normal to the pipe surface is considerably lower than at the front for renewtonian 40 the trailing vortices become unstable and begin to shed on alternating sides of the pipe see fig 2 c leading to oscillating uplift transverse forces on the pipe munson et al 2002 sumer and fredsøe 2006 using computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling bharti et al 2006 and patnana et al 2009 investigated the flow characteristics around a pipe of non newtonian fluids following a power law response 4 τ k γ n where k is the consistency index and n is the power law index similar to β in eq 2 which controls the change of shear stress τ with strain rate γ in these simulations n or β 0 4 2 however the value of β for most natural soils is much lower 0 2 jeong et al 2009 which may change the flow characteristics around a pipe in the case of submarine slide pipe interaction previous flume tests zakeri et al 2008 and cfd simulations zakeri et al 2009 modelling the response of a two phase slide impact i e slide impact on a pipe initially surrounded by ambient water reported a range of force responses that varied as a function of renon newtonian the behaviour was observed to transition from that indicative of non separated flow at low renon newtonian to that of vortex shedding influenced behaviour however the renon newtonian corresponding to the initiation of vortex shedding was not consistent in these studies i e the renon newtonian for initiation of shedding was found to be 20 for the flume tests and 130 for the cfd simulations therefore in order to better understand the genesis and evolution of vortex shedding during slide pipe interaction and how these affect the slide pipe forces a more fundamental study of the detailed soil flow mechanisms during slide pipe interaction at a relevant renon newtonian range in the viscous inertial regime transition is required the primary aim of this paper is to ascertain whether the mechanism of flow separation a precursor to vortex shedding common in newtonian fluid flow past cylinders as depicted in fig 2 affects the horizontal drag forces during slide pipe interaction as such slide flow within a renon newtonian range of 0 5 40 is investigated by means of both centrifuge modelling and cfd simulations this renon newtonian range encapsulates the transition between slide pipe forces dominated by viscous effects to that corresponding to the increase in inertial effects importance renon newtonian 10 as per fig 1 the centrifuge tests were conducted in kaolin samples with β 0 1 sahdi et al 2014c which is much lower than that used in previous cfd simulations bharti et al 2006 patnana et al 2009 but within the range of natural clays β 0 05 0 17 as per jeong et al 2009 in the centrifuge experiments pore pressures at the front and rear of the model pipe were measured during tests conducted at different velocities of horizontal pipe translation through otherwise quiescent kaolin samples since flow separation in newtonian fluid flow around a pipe causes a change in the relative pressures at the pipe front and rear the measured pore pressure at these locations may be used to infer the occurrence of soil flow separation we compare these physical measurements with the results from cfd simulations these simulations are then used to reveal additional flow features of slide pipe interaction at renon newtonian range of 0 5 40 2 experimental and numerical modelling previous flume tests zakeri et al 2008 and cfd simulations e g zakeri et al 2009 dutta and hawlader 2018 simulating submarine slide impact on pipes suspended above the seabed in ambient water multiphase simulation demonstrated that a region of entrapped water can form behind the pipe during the initial phases of slide impact eventually as more slide material interacts with the pipe the entrapped water at the pipe rear is completely filled with slide material the experimental and numerical modelling employed in this paper focus specifically on the latter phase of slide pipe interaction where the pipe is fully engulfed within a flowing soil flume tests zakeri et al 2008 reported that this occurs rapidly within less than 1 s hence the majority of slide duration and the change of slide pipe forces regime are expected to occur after the pipe is fully engulfed this allows idealisation of the slide material as a single phase soil flow 2 1 centrifuge modelling a series of centrifuge experiments were conducted at an acceleration of 40g and involved horizontal translation of an instrumented model pipe model diameter dpipe 20 mm at various velocities in 13 consolidating kaolin samples varying soil densities and undrained strengths where the resulting values of renon newtonian vary between 1 10 5 and 160 the kaolin used in the tests has a measured β

translated horizontally parallel to the soil surface at velocities of up to 4 2 m s during translation of the pipe the pipe was rigidly fixed to an actuator moving along the drum centrifuge channel in this way the pipe is effectively fixed in the vertical direction perpendicular to the soil surface extensive t bar tests were undertaken to measure the reference undrained strength su ref of the consolidating kaolin samples which can then be used to back calculate the change in soil density ρ during pipe horizontal translation pore pressures were measured at the front and rear locations of the model pipe the ppt has a maximum capacity of 700 kpa with a resolution of 0 2 kpa it should be noted that the pore pressure measurements reported in this paper were obtained from the same centrifuge test programme outlined previously in sahdi et al 2014c where a more detailed outline of the test methodology and equipment used in the centrifuge test programme is provided sahdi et al 2014c focused on interpreting the net horizontal pressure during horizontal pipe translation in soil where the final results are shown herein in fig 1 this paper focuses on the interpretation of the

changing su ref and ρ of the consolidating kaolin samples given that flow separation in newtonian fluids flow past a pipe occurs at renewtonian 5 and that the centrifuge tests results shown in fig 1 indicate that the slide pipe resistance increases significantly around renon newtnonian 10 only centrifuge test results within the range of renon newtonian of 0 5 40 are detailed herein the relevant centrifuge test parameters including the corresponding renon newtonian are shown in table 1 2 2 cfd model setup ansys fluent 18 1 ansys 2017 was employed for the cfd modelling with the two dimensional model setup shown in fig 3 a the model domain surrounding the pipe was discretised into two dimensional control volumes fluent employs the finite volume method to solve the conservation of mass and navier stokes equations governing laminar flow around the pipe the pipe was positioned at the centre of a larger circular domain diameter 65dpipe containing the soil fig 3 a which was found through

element width perpendicular to the pipe surface was 3 10 4 m or 0 015d which was demonstrated see latter sections to be sufficiently fine in the renon newtnonian range of interest dpipe is taken as 20 mm which is similar to the model pipe used in the centrifuge tests but the actual value adopted is inconsequential so long as renon newtonian and β eq 2 similarity as in the centrifuge tests are achieved the left half of the large circle was designated as the inflow boundary with a uniform purely horizontal flow velocity specified whereas the right half was specified as an outflow boundary with a gauge pressure of zero a no slip boundary condition with an equivalent sand grain roughness 0 m was imposed at the pipe surface which is equivalent to a fully bonded pipe surface in geotechnical terms zhu and randolph 2011 for the renon newtonian range simulated here the slide flow regime is expected to be laminar for laminar flow the slide pipe flow behaviour is independent of surface roughness since the boundary layer where viscous effects are important is expected to cover typical pipe wall roughness element heights zdravkovich 1990 although the flow investigated is expected to be time independent the temporal term in the navier stokes equation is still considered due to the unknown renon newtonian corresponding to the occurrence of vortex shedding therefore in the simulations the time steps were determined using the courant friedrichs lewy condition 5 δ t c δ x v where the courant number c was selected to be 0 5 and δx represents the minimum mesh dimension perpendicular to the pipe surface the temporal term was discretised using a second order approach and the second order implicit scheme was then used for the temporal integration a second order upwind scheme was chosen for spatial discretization and pressure velocity decoupling was achieved using the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm provided in fluent the viscous behaviour of the slide material was idealised using eq 4 in all cfd simulations assuming that eq 4 is equivalent to the geotechnical power law model eq 2 the parameters n k and τ are specified as n β k s u ref γ ref β and τ su op this links the former three rheological parameters to the soil properties usually obtained from conventional geotechnical soil characterisation from eqs 2 and 3 it is evident that to achieve the desired renon newtonian a high v is required if the magnitude of su ref is large since δt is inversely proportional to v as per eq 5 the total time required to complete a particular simulation case increases when v is large for computational efficiency su ref in eq 2 was taken as 5 pa for all simulations yielding k 5 87 pa s β and γ ref were taken as 0 1 and 0 2s 1 respectively to model the viscous behaviour of uwa kaolin which was obtained through t bar and centrifuge pipe tests sahdi et al 2014a 2014b 2014c the density of the slide material used in the cfd simulations was maintained at a constant value of 1700 kg m3 16 cfd simulations were conducted with varying inlet flow velocities 0 0432 0 4336 m s which corresponds to renon newtonian 0 5 40 an additional cfd simulation at renon newtonian 40 but with β 0 4 and arbitrarily selected values of the remaining parameters selected for computational efficiency was also conducted to compare the current cfd model with that of the non newtonian fluid pipe interaction simulations of patnana et al 2009 noting that the authors did not report the exact parameters utilised in their simulations other than renon newtonian 40 and β 0 4 all relevant slide pipe interaction parameters for the present cfd simulations as well as previous centrifuge tests sahdi et al 2014c and cfd simulations patnana et al 2009 zakeri 2009 are summarised in table 1 3 pore pressure response fig 4 shows example pore pressure measurements at the front and rear pore pressure transducer ppt locations for tests at renon newtonian of 4 1 v 1 73 m s and 37 4 v 2 5 m s along with the hydrostatic pore pressure estimated based on the test depth below the water surface which varied between tests to achieve a constant pipe embedment of 2 5dpipe below the soil surface as the sample is consolidating the difference between the pipe pore pressure measurements um and the hydrostatic pore pressure u0 for each test comprises excess pore pressures due to soil self weight consolidation usw and any excess pore pressure that is generated during pipe displacements ue 6 u m u 0 u e u sw in eq 6 ue is also approximately equivalent to the total stress increase due to pipe translation p p0 since the ppts are located at the front and rear pipe stagnation points pipe equator here p is the total pressure during pipe translation and p0 is the static horizontal pressure in the soil far away from the pipe as can be seen in fig 4 the front pore pressure tends to increase and rear pore pressure decrease relative to the initial magnitudes for all the tests reflecting a net horizontal pressure the difference between the two measurements generally increases with increasing renon newtonian 4 comparison of drag and pressure coefficients a summary of the comparison between the drag coefficient cd and pressure coefficient cp obtained from the pipe front facing the slide flow and rear facing the slide flow wake from the present and patnana et al 2009 cfd simulations β 0 4 are summarised in table 2 cd and cp are defined respectively as panton 2006 7 c d 2 q h ρv 2 8 c p p p 0 0 5 ρv 2 where p is the normal pressure on the pipe surface in this paper normal to either the pipe front or rear and p0 is the horizontal pressure of the slide upstream of the pipe front contrary to the horizontal drag coefficient ch in eq 1 cd follows a more traditional interpretation of the drag coefficient originating from fluid mechanics panton 2006 sumer and fredsøe 2006 where both the viscous and inertial effects are lumped together since qh is the net horizontal pressure see eq 7 it can be seen in table 2 that the present cfd simulations gave almost identical cd and cp to that reported by patnana et al 2009 thus providing a level of validation to the present cfd modelling fig 5 compares the drag coefficient cd eq 7 obtained from the centrifuge tests with the present cfd simulations along with the data obtained from other cfd simulations reported by zakeri 2009 as depicted in fig 5 it is evident that although constant values of ρ and s u ref have been adopted in the cfd simulations the cd trend compare well with the centrifuge test results this consistency occurs because the forces and the flow regimes are largely dependent on the non dimensional value of renon newtonian provided that the appropriate β value is used this agreement gives further confidence in the cfd model allowing useful exploration of the slide pipe flow mechanisms through cfd simulations the good comparison between the current simulations and those of zakeri 2009 also demonstrates that a single phase modelling approach is generally able to capture the slide pipe impact resistance provided that the pipe is fully engulfed by the slide the slight differences between the results are likely attributable to the marginally lower β parameter than that used in the zakeri 2009 cfd simulations β 0 11 0 13 moreover at renon newtonian 40 using β 0 1 corresponding to the viscous behaviour of uwa kaolin the cd is approximately 6 higher see fig 5 than that reported by patnana et al 2009 where β 0 4 demonstrating a slight dependency of the net horizontal slide pipe pressure on the β parameter in addition to renon newtonian 5 flow separation the velocity streamlines of the soil flow around the pipe at renon newtonian 5 20 are shown in fig 6 for renon newtonian 5 the streamlines follow the curvature of the pipe and converge at the pipe rear without separation for renon newtonian 10 the flow begins to separate from the pipe surface causing the formation of a pair of small symmetrical vortices i e recirculation bubbles attached to the rear of the pipe similar to newtonian fluid pipe interaction flow separation occurs because the fluid particles experience a kinetic energy deficit while flowing from the upstream pipe front to the pipe rear owing to viscous effects close to the pipe surface from fig 6 it can be seen that the size of the recirculation bubbles grows with increasing renon newtonian apart from the qualitative observations shown in fig 6 we present two quantitative measurements the shear stress distribution on the pipe and the length of the recirculation zone in order to demonstrate the evolving slide pipe flow mechanism with increasing renon newtonian the shear stress distributions around the pipe circumference for renon newtonian 0 5 40 are depicted in fig 7 in the form of the normalised shear stress τ achenbach 1968 9 τ τ t ρv 2 re non newtonian here the τ is plotted against the angle around the pipe θ measured clockwise from the front stagnation point as indicated in fig 7 in eq 9 the shear stress acting parallel to the pipe surface τt can be written as munson et al 2002 panton 2006 10 τ t μ u y here μ is the viscosity of the slide material and u y is the local velocity gradient normal to the pipe surface at the point of flow separation u y 0 and therefore τt 0 beyond that the soil flow reverses resulting in u y 0 i e τt 0 it can be seen that for renon newtonian 10 the τ distribution increases when θ 0 to a maximum at θ 70 90 before decreasing to a minimum at θ 180 without crossing the τ 0 line indicating that the soil flows around the pipe without separation at renon newtonian 10 the τ distributions appear to reduce below 0 before reaching θ 180 indicating that the slide flow reverses at the pipe rear i e u y 0 it is interesting to note that the θ corresponding to a maximum τ tends to move towards the pipe front stagnation point see fig 7 as renon newtonian increases this can be linked to the evolving flow mechanisms with increasing renon newtonian see fig 6 which is consistent with the case of newtonian fluid flow around a pipe achenbach 1968 the θ value where τ 0 corresponds to the position around the pipe where flow separation occurs i e θs the angle of flow separation θs corresponding to renon newtonian 10 is plotted in fig 8 which generally indicates that as renon newtonian increases the flow separation point moves towards the front stagnation point the change in the size of the recirculation zone can also be quantified by plotting the increase in the recirculation zone length lr normalised by the pipe diameter lr dpipe with renon newtonian this is shown in fig 9 where the definition of lr is also depicted it can be observed here that lr dpipe increases slowly in the renon newtonian range of 10 15 after which it increases linearly when renon newtonian 15 the changing magnitude of θs and lr dpipe in figs 8 and 9 respectively suggest that the recirculation zone grows both horizontally away from the pipe rear and circumferentially towards the pipe front stagnation point with increasing renon newtonian 6 influence of flow separation as discussed earlier the measured pore pressure in the experiments is equal to the sum of the hydrostatic pore pressure u0 the excess pore pressure from the sample self weight consolidation usw and the change in total pressure in the vicinity of the pore pressure transducer ppt p p0 where p and p0 is the local total pressure due to the pipe displacement and the far field horizontal pressure respectively since u0 usw and p0 are the same on the front and back of the pipe the pore pressure data obtained from the centrifuge tests can be analysed by plotting the evolution of the difference in the pore pressure measured at the front and rear pore pressure transducers ppt δu normalised by su op eq 2 against renon newtonian as shown in fig 10 it can be seen here that δu su op remains relatively constant when renon newtonian 10 beyond which it increases with renon newtonian assuming undrained conditions in the experiments the pore pressures measured at the centrifuge model pipe front and rear mainly reflect the total pressure changes at these locations as the model pipe is translated horizontally in the soil sample as such direct comparison with the cfd simulations can be made by assuming that the pressure difference on the pipe front and rear from the cfd simulations δp δu which is then also normalised by su op fig 10 generally δp su op obtained from the cfd simulations follow a similar trend with the centrifuge results and agrees well with δu su op at renon newtonian 10 but differs somewhat for lower values of renon newtonian this difference is believed to be related to the size of the ppts each ppt diameter occupies approximately 9 of the model pipe circumference where a large portion of each ppt surface area is located away from the pipe front or rear stagnation point and the measured pressure represents the averaged pore pressure acting on the ppt surface area moreover excess pore pressures arising from soil pipe shearing may influence the measured pore pressure magnitudes especially at low renon newtonian at higher renon newtonian viscous effects are less significant and the ppt measurements reflect the total normal pressure changes more closely causing the cfd δp su op and centrifuge ppt δu su op results to converge the increase in both δu su op and δp su op beyond a constant magnitude occurs almost concurrently at renon newtonian corresponding to flow separation 10 the increasing recirculation zone size at the pipe rear observed for renon newtonian 10 see figs 6 9 causes the pressure at the pipe rear to decrease rapidly relative to that at the front resulting in large pressure differences between these two positions this coincides with large horizontal pressure drag and is also coincident with the renon newtonian 10 where inertial effects begin to increase in significance compared to viscous effects see fig 1 to this end it is shown that the flow mechanisms that occur during slide pipe interaction appear to be fundamentally similar to that of newtonian fluids as in the case for newtonian fluid flow past a pipe see fig 2 when the renon newtonian increases the symmetrical vortices in the recirculation zone may be drawn farther away from the pipe rear until it becomes unstable and begins to oscillate eventually at higher renon newtonian the pair of symmetrical vortices at the pipe rear may shed periodically this phenomenon in principle also leads to oscillating uplift forces on the pipe and should be assessed in future research to facilitate offshore pipe design in areas susceptible to submarine slide hazards 7 conclusions the behaviour of submarine slide flow around a pipe at a non newtonian reynolds number renon newtonian range of 0 5 40 has been investigated by means of centrifuge modelling and cfd simulations the centrifuge experiments involved measurements of the pore pressures at a model pipe front facing the upstream soil flow and rear facing the soil flow wake using pore pressure transducers located at these two positions the cfd model was benchmarked by comparing the computed drag coefficients with those from the centrifuge experiments and numerical simulations from the literature where good agreement is achieved it is shown that the drag coefficient changes significantly with renon newtonian and also varies slightly with the β parameter the latter of which controls the shear stress strain rate behaviour of the soil close inspection of the velocity streamlines and the shear stress distribution around the pipe obtained from cfd simulations reveals that the slide flow separates from the pipe surface when renon newtonian 10 forming a recirculation zone in the form of a pair of symmetrical vortices at the pipe rear as the renon newtonian increases beyond 10 the recirculation zone increases in size by assuming that the difference in the pore pressure at the centrifuge model pipe front to that at the rear δu is equal to the difference in the total normal pressure δp at these locations the evolution of these normalised pressures δu su op and δp su op su op soil operative undrained strength obtained from the centrifuge tests and cfd simulations respectively can be compared it is shown that the increase in both δu su op and δp su op beyond a constant value occurs almost concurrently with the initiation of slide flow separation around the pipe surface renon newtonian 10 this corresponds closely to the transition where the slide pipe horizontal pressure evolves from that dominated by viscous effects to horizontal pressures corresponding to increased inertial effects significance the research reported in this paper provides insights into the mechanisms driving the changes in the horizontal submarine slide pipe force regimes and provide the foundation for further exploration into other plausible aspects of design such as oscillatory vertical pipe forces induced by vortex shedding at renon newtonian larger

22682,this paper investigates submarine slide pipe interaction through centrifuge tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd with particular focus on the soil flow mechanisms that occur around a suspended pipe at non newtonian reynolds numbers renon newtonian between 0 5 and 40 the centrifuge tests involve horizontal translation of a model pipe in samples of kaolin at different densities and undrained strengths whilst measuring pore pressures at the model pipe front and rear these measurements provide insights into the pressure evolution at these pipe locations with increasing renon newtonian in the cfd simulations the submarine slide is idealised as a single phase non newtonian power law fluid that flows around a two dimensional pipe fully engulfed cfd modelling demonstrates that the drag coefficient depends on both renon newtonian and the power law index controlling the slide material viscous behaviour examination of the observed cfd flow features reveals that slide flow can separate from the pipe surface when renon newtonian 10 it is shown that the renon newtonian at which soil flow separation occurs approximately coincides with increases in the 1 differences in

these results indicate that nh is approximately constant at low renon newtonian before increasing linearly over the renon newtonian range of interest for submarine slides with a slope of 0 5ch for renon newtonian 10 indicating the increased importance of inertial effects although the results shown in fig 1 are relevant to the expected field renon newtonian range of up to 240 zakeri et al 2008 where eq 1 can be fitted to the data and used to estimate the horizontal pressure on a pipe during slide impact the evolving mechanisms of soil flow with increasing renon newtonian has not been systematically investigated for newtonian fluids it is well known that the flow mechanisms around a cylindrical structure changes with increasing renewtonian panton 2006 sumer and fredsøe 2006 see for example fig 2 which in turn alter the forces acting on the pipe it should be noted that renewtonian is defined as renewtonian ρvdpipe μ where μ dynamic viscosity of the newtonian fluid for renewtonian 5 the velocity streamlines remain attached to the pipe surface fig 2a as inertial effects increase at 5 renewtonian 40 fig 2b the loss of kinetic energy as fluid moves around the pipe curvature leads to fluid separation from the pipe surface this leads to the formation of symmetric vortex pairs in the form of recirculation bubbles at the pipe rear here the pressure normal to the pipe surface is considerably lower than at the front for renewtonian 40 the trailing vortices become unstable and begin to shed on alternating sides of the pipe see fig 2 c leading to oscillating uplift transverse forces on the pipe munson et al 2002 sumer and fredsøe 2006 using computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling bharti et al 2006 and patnana et al 2009 investigated the flow characteristics around a pipe of non newtonian fluids following a power law response 4 τ k γ n where k is the consistency index and n is the power law index similar to β in eq 2 which controls the change of shear stress τ with strain rate γ in these simulations n or β 0 4 2 however the value of β for most natural soils is much lower 0 2 jeong et al 2009 which may change the flow characteristics around a pipe in the case of submarine slide pipe interaction previous flume tests zakeri et al 2008 and cfd simulations zakeri et al 2009 modelling the response of a two phase slide impact i e slide impact on a pipe initially surrounded by ambient water reported a range of force responses that varied as a function of renon newtonian the behaviour was observed to transition from that indicative of non separated flow at low renon newtonian to that of vortex shedding influenced behaviour however the renon newtonian corresponding to the initiation of vortex shedding was not consistent in these studies i e the renon newtonian for initiation of shedding was found to be 20 for the flume tests and 130 for the cfd simulations therefore in order to better understand the genesis and evolution of vortex shedding during slide pipe interaction and how these affect the slide pipe forces a more fundamental study of the detailed soil flow mechanisms during slide pipe interaction at a relevant renon newtonian range in the viscous inertial regime transition is required the primary aim of this paper is to ascertain whether the mechanism of flow separation a precursor to vortex shedding common in newtonian fluid flow past cylinders as depicted in fig 2 affects the horizontal drag forces during slide pipe interaction as such slide flow within a renon newtonian range of 0 5 40 is investigated by means of both centrifuge modelling and cfd simulations this renon newtonian range encapsulates the transition between slide pipe forces dominated by viscous effects to that corresponding to the increase in inertial effects importance renon newtonian 10 as per fig 1 the centrifuge tests were conducted in kaolin samples with β 0 1 sahdi et al 2014c which is much lower than that used in previous cfd simulations bharti et al 2006 patnana et al 2009 but within the range of natural clays β 0 05 0 17 as per jeong et al 2009 in the centrifuge experiments pore pressures at the front and rear of the model pipe were measured during tests conducted at different velocities of horizontal pipe translation through otherwise quiescent kaolin samples since flow separation in newtonian fluid flow around a pipe causes a change in the relative pressures at the pipe front and rear the measured pore pressure at these locations may be used to infer the occurrence of soil flow separation we compare these physical measurements with the results from cfd simulations these simulations are then used to reveal additional flow features of slide pipe interaction at renon newtonian range of 0 5 40 2 experimental and numerical modelling previous flume tests zakeri et al 2008 and cfd simulations e g zakeri et al 2009 dutta and hawlader 2018 simulating submarine slide impact on pipes suspended above the seabed in ambient water multiphase simulation demonstrated that a region of entrapped water can form behind the pipe during the initial phases of slide impact eventually as more slide material interacts with the pipe the entrapped water at the pipe rear is completely filled with slide material the experimental and numerical modelling employed in this paper focus specifically on the latter phase of slide pipe interaction where the pipe is fully engulfed within a flowing soil flume tests zakeri et al 2008 reported that this occurs rapidly within less than 1 s hence the majority of slide duration and the change of slide pipe forces regime are expected to occur after the pipe is fully engulfed this allows idealisation of the slide material as a single phase soil flow 2 1 centrifuge modelling a

of drag and pressure coefficients a summary of the comparison between the drag coefficient cd and pressure coefficient cp obtained from the pipe front facing the slide flow and rear facing the slide flow wake from the present and patnana et al 2009 cfd simulations β 0 4 are summarised in table 2 cd and cp are defined respectively as panton 2006 7 c d 2 q h ρv 2 8 c p p p 0 0 5 ρv 2 where p is the normal pressure on the pipe surface in this paper normal to either the pipe front or rear and p0 is the horizontal pressure of the slide upstream of the pipe front contrary to the horizontal drag coefficient ch in eq 1 cd follows a more traditional interpretation of the drag coefficient originating from fluid mechanics panton 2006 sumer and fredsøe 2006 where both the viscous and inertial effects are lumped together since qh is the net horizontal pressure see eq 7 it can be seen in table 2 that the present cfd simulations gave almost identical cd and cp to that reported by patnana et al 2009 thus providing a level of validation to the present cfd modelling fig 5 compares the drag coefficient cd eq 7 obtained from the centrifuge tests with the present cfd simulations along with the data obtained from other cfd simulations reported by zakeri 2009 as depicted in fig 5 it is evident that although constant values of ρ and s u ref have been adopted in the cfd simulations the cd trend compare well with the centrifuge test results this consistency occurs because the forces and the flow regimes are largely dependent on the non dimensional value of renon newtonian provided that the appropriate β value is used this agreement gives further confidence in the cfd model allowing useful exploration of the slide pipe flow mechanisms through cfd simulations the good comparison between the current simulations and those of zakeri 2009 also demonstrates that a single phase modelling approach is generally able to capture the slide pipe impact resistance provided that the pipe is fully engulfed by the slide the slight differences between the results are likely attributable to the marginally lower β parameter than that used in the zakeri 2009 cfd simulations β 0 11 0 13 moreover at renon newtonian 40 using β 0 1 corresponding to the viscous behaviour of uwa kaolin the cd is approximately 6 higher see fig 5 than that reported by patnana et al 2009 where β 0 4 demonstrating a slight dependency of the net horizontal slide pipe pressure on the β parameter in addition to renon newtonian 5 flow separation the velocity streamlines of the soil flow around the pipe at renon newtonian 5 20 are shown in fig 6 for renon newtonian 5 the streamlines follow the curvature of the pipe and converge at the pipe rear without separation for renon newtonian 10 the flow begins to separate from the pipe surface causing the formation of a pair of small symmetrical vortices i e recirculation bubbles attached to the rear of the pipe similar to newtonian fluid pipe interaction flow separation occurs because the fluid particles experience a kinetic energy deficit while flowing from the upstream pipe front to the pipe rear owing to viscous effects close to the pipe surface from fig 6 it can be seen that the size of the recirculation bubbles grows with increasing renon newtonian apart from the qualitative observations shown in fig 6 we present two quantitative measurements the shear stress distribution on the pipe and the length of the recirculation zone in order to demonstrate the evolving slide pipe flow mechanism with increasing renon newtonian the shear stress distributions around the pipe circumference for renon newtonian 0 5 40 are depicted in fig 7 in the form of the normalised shear stress τ achenbach 1968 9 τ τ t ρv 2 re non newtonian here the τ is plotted against the angle around the pipe θ measured clockwise from the front stagnation point as indicated in fig 7 in eq 9 the shear stress acting parallel to the pipe surface τt can be written as munson et al 2002 panton 2006 10 τ t μ u y here μ is the viscosity of the slide material and u y is the local velocity gradient normal to the pipe surface at the point of flow separation u y 0 and therefore τt 0 beyond that the soil flow reverses resulting in u y 0 i e τt 0 it can be seen that for renon newtonian 10 the τ distribution increases when θ 0 to a maximum at θ 70 90 before decreasing to a minimum at θ 180 without crossing the τ 0 line indicating that the soil flows around the pipe without separation at renon newtonian 10 the τ distributions appear to reduce below 0 before reaching θ 180 indicating that the slide flow reverses at the pipe rear i e u y 0 it is interesting to note that the θ corresponding to a maximum τ tends to move towards the pipe front stagnation point see fig 7 as renon newtonian increases this can be linked to the evolving flow mechanisms with increasing renon newtonian see fig 6 which is consistent with the case of newtonian fluid flow around a pipe achenbach 1968 the θ value where τ 0 corresponds to the position around the pipe where flow separation occurs i e θs the angle of flow separation θs corresponding to renon newtonian 10 is plotted in fig 8 which generally indicates that as renon newtonian increases the flow separation point moves towards the front stagnation point the change in the size of the recirculation zone can also be quantified by plotting the increase in the recirculation zone length lr normalised by the pipe diameter lr dpipe with renon newtonian this is shown in fig 9 where the definition of lr is also depicted it can be observed here that lr dpipe increases slowly in the renon newtonian range of 10 15 after which it increases linearly when renon newtonian 15 the changing magnitude of θs and lr dpipe in figs 8 and 9 respectively suggest that the recirculation zone grows both horizontally away from the pipe rear and circumferentially towards the pipe front stagnation point with increasing renon newtonian 6 influence of flow separation as discussed earlier the measured pore pressure in the experiments is equal to the sum of the hydrostatic pore pressure u0 the excess pore pressure from the sample self weight consolidation usw and the change in total pressure in the vicinity of the pore pressure transducer ppt p p0 where p and p0 is the local total pressure due to the pipe displacement and the far field horizontal pressure respectively since u0 usw and p0 are the same on the front and back of the pipe the pore pressure data obtained from the centrifuge tests can be analysed by plotting the evolution of the difference in the pore pressure measured at the front and rear pore pressure transducers ppt δu normalised by su op eq 2 against renon newtonian as shown in fig 10 it can be seen here that δu su op remains relatively constant when renon newtonian 10 beyond which it increases with renon newtonian assuming undrained conditions in the experiments the pore pressures measured at the centrifuge model pipe front and rear mainly reflect the total pressure changes at these locations as the model pipe is translated horizontally in the soil sample as such direct comparison with the cfd simulations can be made by assuming that the pressure difference on the pipe front and rear from the cfd simulations δp δu which is then also normalised by su op fig 10 generally δp su op obtained from the cfd simulations follow a similar trend with the centrifuge results and agrees well with δu su op at renon newtonian 10 but differs somewhat for lower values of renon newtonian this difference is believed to be related to the size of the ppts each ppt diameter occupies approximately 9 of the model pipe circumference where a large portion of each ppt surface area is located away from the pipe front or rear stagnation point and the measured pressure represents the averaged pore pressure acting on the ppt surface area moreover excess pore pressures arising from soil pipe shearing may influence the measured pore pressure magnitudes especially at low renon newtonian at higher renon newtonian viscous effects are less significant and the ppt measurements reflect the total normal pressure changes more closely causing the cfd δp su op and centrifuge ppt δu su op results to converge the increase in both δu su op and δp su op beyond a constant magnitude occurs almost concurrently at renon newtonian corresponding to flow separation 10 the increasing recirculation zone size at the pipe rear observed for renon newtonian 10 see figs 6 9 causes the pressure at the pipe rear to decrease rapidly relative to that at the front resulting in large pressure differences between these two positions this coincides with large horizontal pressure drag and is also coincident with the renon newtonian 10 where inertial effects begin to increase in significance compared to viscous effects see fig 1 to this end it is shown that the flow mechanisms that occur during slide pipe interaction appear to be fundamentally similar to that of newtonian fluids as in the case for newtonian fluid flow past a pipe see fig 2 when the renon newtonian increases the symmetrical vortices in the recirculation zone may be drawn farther away from the pipe rear until it becomes unstable and begins to oscillate eventually at higher renon newtonian the pair of symmetrical vortices at the pipe rear may shed periodically this phenomenon in principle also leads to oscillating uplift forces on the pipe and should be assessed in future research to facilitate offshore pipe design in areas susceptible to submarine slide hazards 7 conclusions the behaviour of submarine slide flow around a pipe at a non newtonian reynolds number renon newtonian range of 0 5 40 has been investigated by means of centrifuge modelling and cfd simulations the centrifuge experiments involved measurements of the pore pressures at a model pipe front facing the upstream soil flow and rear facing the soil flow wake using pore pressure transducers located at these two positions the cfd model was benchmarked by comparing the computed drag coefficients with those from the centrifuge experiments and numerical simulations from the literature where good agreement is achieved it is shown that the drag coefficient changes significantly with renon newtonian and also varies slightly with the β parameter the latter of which controls the shear stress strain rate behaviour of the soil close inspection of the velocity streamlines and the shear stress distribution around the pipe obtained from cfd simulations reveals that the slide flow separates from the pipe surface when renon newtonian 10 forming a recirculation zone in the form of a pair of symmetrical vortices at the pipe rear as the renon newtonian increases beyond 10 the recirculation zone increases in size by assuming that the difference in the pore pressure at the centrifuge model pipe front to that at the rear δu is equal to the difference in the total normal pressure δp at these locations the evolution of these normalised pressures δu su op and δp su op su op soil operative undrained strength obtained from the centrifuge tests and cfd simulations respectively can be compared it is shown that the increase in both δu su op and δp su op beyond a constant value occurs almost concurrently with the initiation of slide flow separation around the pipe surface renon newtonian 10 this corresponds closely to the transition where the slide pipe horizontal pressure evolves from that dominated by viscous effects to horizontal pressures corresponding to increased inertial effects significance the research reported in this paper provides insights into the mechanisms driving the changes in the horizontal submarine slide pipe force regimes and provide the foundation for further exploration into other plausible aspects of design such as oscillatory vertical pipe forces induced by vortex shedding at renon newtonian larger

22683,in this paper vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder with an attached filament is numerically studied by a penalty immersed boundary method pibm in the current work we study the effects of a single filament on the flow wake of a fixed cylinder as well as its dynamic response when it is free to move transversely two key parameters the bending coefficient kb and the length l of the filament are considered we report that for a static cylinder by increasing the length or the rigidity of the filament both the mean drag force and the fluctuation amplitude of the lift force on the cylinder can be reduced when the cylinder is free to move it is found that the existence of a filament actually enhances the vibration of the cylinder by comparing to that of a bare cylinder differentiating from the prediction of lift fluctuation on a fixed cylinder in the meanwhile it leads to a broader resonance region on the vibration response of the cylinder with respect to the reduced velocity moreover various flow patterns are identified in the wake of cylinder for different filament lengths keywords flexible filaments suppression penalty immersed boundary method 1 introduction controlling vortex induced vibrations viv is important in ocean structures in designing robust heat exchangers and especially in the offshore industry given the new emphasis on deep water drilling williamson and govardhan 2004 xie et al 2012 2017 in deep water immersed structures such as risers usually have low damping and their over time viv will weaken the risers and ultimately cause fatigue and fracture replacement of the pipelines is a very expensive and time consuming process hence new suppression techniques are required many flow control techniques have been proposed to suppress viv such as splitter plates assi et al 2009 bao and tao 2013 suction based flow control dong et al 2008 chen et al 2013 slits parallel to the incoming flow baek and karniadakis 2009 stream

xie et al 2015 the rigid splitter plates or fairings can effectively suppress viv for its obstruction of boundary layers interaction stappenbeltet al 2010 however they should be free to rotate to align themselves with the flow otherwise their effectiveness decreases substantially and galloping oscillations may result assi et al 2009 liang et al 2018a recently flexible devices such as flexible splitter plates or filaments become attractive in passive flow control wu et al 2014 favier et al 2009 as they can self adapt to direct flow without the input of energy bagheri et al bagheri et al 2012 have shown that an elastic filament attached to the base of a cylinder can both produce a net lift force and reduce the mean drag force on the cylinder wu et al wu et al 2014 2016 found that the fluctuation of lift force together with the mean drag force of the fixed cylinder can be suppressed effectively with flexible filaments regarding vibration response of cylinder attached with flexible filaments wu et al wu et al 2014 presented the viv suppression phenomenon occurs as a relatively long filament l 2 with medium flexibility 1 7 ω 2 3 is used however all the numerical study in wu s study wu et al 2014 was for a single reduced velocity of 5 on the other hand liang et al liang et al 2018b carried out a series of viv experiments in wind tunnel for a cylinder fitted with flexible splitter plates in different lengths under various reduced velocities with corresponding reynolds number in the range of 7000 66000 they found that all the synchronization region is postponed for splitter plates of length less than 1 1d vibration response is still typical viv and they are suppressed but galloping instability shows up as a further increase of length of the flexible plate it is inferred that high frequency components in the flow are responsible for the high amplitude response favier et al favier et al 2009 found if a circular cylinder was partially coated with hair the reductions of the average drag up to 15 and lift fluctuation up to 15 were achieved this configuration may be potentially effective in suppress viv and reduce drag by justifying the number and the rigidity of the filaments penalty immersed boundary method is capable to study this problem with multiple elastic boundaries in the current work we start from a single filament in the control of cylinder wake under various reduced velocities systematically and understand the corresponding fluid structure interaction mechanism the numerical simulations has been performed at a low reynolds number range of 80 280 see fig 1 the cylinder is fixed or elastically mounted and the filament is attached to the rear of the cylinder its trailing end is free to flap to execute the numerical simulation and deal with the fluid structure interaction fsi of the filament as well a penalty immersed boundary method ibm is used kim and peskin 2007 where the mass effect of the cylinder and filament can be included the current paper is organized as follows in sec 2 the formulation of the problem and the simulation methodology for the cylinder with filaments in a fluid flow are presented in sec 3 we provide a thorough parametric study on the filament with emphasis on their performances in viv and drag force reduction finally in sec 4 we draw our conclusions 2 numerical method the basic concept of a penalty ibm is to split the immersed boundary conceptually into two lagrangian components one component is massless which interacts with the fluid exactly as that in a traditional ibm implementation i e it moves at the local fluid velocity and the induced solid stress is distributed to the surrounding fluid cells the other component carries mass which is connected to the massless component by a stiff spring it has no elasticity of its own and does not interact with the fluid directly according to the newton s law of motion the massive component of the immersed boundary moves independently only with the forces generated by the system of stiff spring if the effect of gravity is included it is imposed on the massive component of the immersed boundary since the spring is usually very stiff the massless and massive components stay very close to each other hence the whole system acts like an immersed boundary with mass the equations governing this fluid structure coupling system are expressed as following 1 ρ u t u u p μ 2 u f 2 u 0 3 f x t f s t δ x x s d s 4 x t r s t u r s t u x t δ x x r s t d x 5 f f e f k f c 6 f e e x 7 f k r s t k y r s t x s t 8 f c r s t δ x r s t x s x x x x 9 ρ s r s 2 y 2 t f k r s t ρ s r s f r g g equations 1 and 2 are the navier stokes equations for a viscous incompressible fluid which are solved by a finite volume based solver openfoam here ρ u p are the density velocity and pressure of the fluid respectively the term f r s in equation 3 include the elastic force f e induced by the deformation of the elastic boundary and the repulsive force f c between the filament and cylinder and the term f x represents the fluid body force density for the flexible filament it can be regarded as a 1 d massive boundaries which are represented by a serial of one dimensional rods we impose two elasticities to these rods one resists stretching and compression and the other resists bending the energy function e x can therefore be formalized as 10 e x 1 2 k s x s 1 2 d s 1 2 k b 2 x 2 s 2 d s where k s and k b denote the coefficients by resisting the stretching and bending respectively for a massive cylinder we modify pib method by assuming that the mass of the cylinder is concentrated at its center kim and peskin 2007 this is permissible since only translations of the cylinder are considered without rotations therefore eqn 7 can be modified into 11 f k s t k y t z s t x s t where k is the penalty constant and z s t is the equilibrium position of the cylinder for the equation of motion of the massive center point of the cylinder we need to integrate all the forces from the massless boundary on the massive center point y t and we also need to include the forces of the mechanical restraints spring that hold the cylinder on place in the laboratory experiment thus we are led to the equation 12 m d 2 y t d t 2 s y t f k s t d s here we consider the cylinder moves in both in line and cross flow directions the mass ratio of the cylinder is m ρ d 2 6 and the spring constant is s m 2 π f 2 where f 0 2 which is close to the vortex shedding frequency of a static cylinder to meet the in extensibility condition of the filament k s is set as 200000 in the simulations the other parameters are set as ρ s ρ 1 f r 0 k 5000 k b 0 01 3 numerical results and discussions 3 1 a fixed cylinder with an attached filament in this section we consider flow past a fixed cylinder with an attached filament at a fixed reynolds number r e u ν d 100 where d is the diameter of the circular cylinder u is the stream wise velocity far upstream and ν is the kinematic viscosity the effects of the filament on the flow control of the cylinder by varying the length l of the filament are firstly examined fig 2 shows the phase diagram of drag and lift coefficients for the cylinder filament system under various length the black line denotes the reference value for the cylinder without filaments it is seen that the effect of the attached filament on the evolution of the forces acting on the cylinder is remarkable with the attached filament both the mean drag coefficient and the fluctuation of lift force can be suppressed effectively the longer filament performs better since it can delay the vortex shedding in the cylinder wake to a further downstream see fig 3 for the case with the filament length of l 0 5 d and l d the symmetry of lift fluctuation is broken and a positive net lift force is achieved by looking at the flapping trajectory of the filament in fig 4 we see that the filament is flapping in the low half part of the cylinder wake thus generating a positive lift force to the cylinder filament system moreover as the effect of the bending stiffness we see that in fig 5 a more rigid filament can achieve a lower drag coefficient and smaller lift fluctuation flapping amplitude by checking the flow pattern it is seen that the vortex is roll up back to the top surface of the filament tail for the rigid one with k b 0 02 therefore leading to the recovery of pressure in the wake of filament see fig 6 3 2 a free to vibrate cylinder with an attached filament in this section we investigate the viv of a cylinder attached with a filament the vibration responses of the cylinder are studied by varying the reduced velocity which is defined as u u f s d where f s is the first natural frequency of the elastic mounted cylinder the vibration response of cylinder a y is normalized with the cylinder diameter d all simulations are carried out at a fixed natural frequency f s 0 2 of the cylinder we note that we vary the reduced velocity u by changing the incoming fluid velocity u in fig 7 we present the vibration and the corresponding frequency responses of the cylinder for various filament lengths the results for a bare cylinder by both numerical simulation and experiments zhou et al 2011 are also included it is observed that the maximum vibration response of the bare cylinder is about 0 5d which is very close to the previous experiment zhou et al 2011 while occurring at u 4 5 by comparing to u 6 7 in the experiment zhou et al 2011 we conjecture that the derivation is due to the different reynolds number in the experiments zhou et al 2011 with the order of 10000 it is interesting to find that the maximum vibration is increased by attaching a filament they are a y 0 722 at u 6 for the filament length of l 1 d and a y 0 71 at u 10 for l 2 d respectively in the meanwhile the resonance region becomes broader and it is shifted to larger reduced velocities which is more profound for the longer filament i e l 2 d in specific the resonance region is located at 5 u 10 for the filament length of l d and 5 u 25 for l 2 d correspondingly the dominant frequencies for both cases are locked into the natural frequency f s as shown in the right panel of fig 7 moreover in the bare cylinder the vibration response is always symmetric with respect to the equilibrium position resulted in a zero mean displacement a y however for the cylinder attached with a filament it is seen that there is a vibration defection resulted in a positive negative mean displacement a y at relatively larger u e g u 8 for l d and u 14 for l 2 d furthermore we find that the trend of cylinder vibration amplitude is related to the flapping patterns of the attached filament figs 8 and 9 presents the dynamic response of the filament tip under various reduced velocities with various filament length at the high vibration amplitude of cylinder i e u 6 l d and u 8 l 2 d the corresponding filament flaps very widely and it is across zero balance position this greatly increases the wind ward surface of the cylinder filament system leading to a large oscillating cylinder vibration while at the suppressed region of the cylinder i e u 4 12 14 l d and u 16 l 2 d the corresponding filament is mostly flapping to one side with small vibration therefore the effect of filament on the cylinder vibration is weak the flow patterns have also been greatly altered with the existence of the filament as shown in fig 10 the bare cylinder wake is associated with a 2s mode where negative vorticity and positive ones are aligned in two rows as they travel downstream for l d a p s mode dominates the wake at the maximum vibration response see fig 11 for l 2 d the flow wake is composed of 2p modes see fig 12 compared to a bare cylinder the wake is more widened in the cross flow direction for those with filaments which is consistent to the corresponding vibration responses as for the cases apart from the resonance region or with small vibration responses the wake presents the classical vortex street as shown in fig 13 by examining the drag and lift coefficients we find that the effect of the filament can actually reduce the drag though the vibrations are not suppressed as shown in fig 14 here we should point out that the forces include the contribution from both the cylinder and the filament specifically the maximum drag coefficient is reduced by 10 for l d u 6 while it is reduced by 36 for l 2 d u 10 4 conclusion in the present work we apply penalty ibm method to simulate the flow past a cylinder with a flexible filament we find that for a static cylinder both the mean drag force and the fluctuation amplitude of the lift force on the cylinder can be reduced by increasing the length or the rigidity of the filament this is because that a long filament can delay the vortex shedding in the cylinder wake further downstream and a more rigid filament can recover the pressure in the wake when the cylinder is free to move the vibration response of a cylinder with attached filament is still a typical viv but with a higher amplitude response by comparing to a bare cylinder in the meanwhile the existence of a filament can lead to a broader resonance region and this phenomena becomes more remarkable and the resonance region is shifted to larger reduced velocities for l 2d however the drag force coefficient is still reduced by attaching the filament the maximum drag coefficient is suppressed by 10 with l d and the drag is reduced by 36 with l 2d by examining the flow pattern the cylinder wake presents a p s mode for filament length of l d and 2p mode for l 2d at the maximum vibration responses acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledges

flow directions the mass ratio of the cylinder is m ρ d 2 6 and the spring constant is s m 2 π f 2 where f 0 2 which is close to the vortex shedding frequency of a static cylinder to meet the in extensibility condition of the filament k s is set as 200000 in the simulations the other parameters are set as ρ s ρ 1 f r 0 k 5000 k b 0 01 3 numerical results and discussions 3 1 a fixed cylinder with an attached filament in this section we consider flow past a fixed cylinder with an attached filament at a fixed reynolds number r e u ν d 100 where d is the diameter of the circular cylinder u is the stream wise velocity far upstream and ν is the kinematic viscosity the effects of the filament on the flow control of the cylinder by varying the length l of the filament are firstly examined fig 2 shows the phase diagram of drag and lift coefficients for the cylinder filament system under various length the black line denotes the reference value for the cylinder without filaments it is seen that the effect of the attached filament on the evolution of the forces acting on the cylinder is remarkable with the attached filament both the mean drag coefficient and the fluctuation of lift force can be suppressed effectively the longer filament performs better since it can delay the vortex shedding in the cylinder wake to a further downstream see fig 3 for the case with the filament length of l 0 5 d and l d the symmetry of lift fluctuation is broken and a positive net lift force is achieved by looking at the flapping trajectory of the filament in fig 4 we see that the filament is flapping in the low half part of the cylinder wake thus generating a positive lift force to the cylinder filament system moreover as the effect of the bending stiffness we see that in fig 5 a more rigid filament can achieve a lower drag coefficient and smaller lift fluctuation flapping amplitude by checking the flow pattern it is seen that the vortex is roll up back to the top surface of the filament tail for the rigid one with k b 0 02 therefore leading to the recovery of pressure in the wake of filament see fig 6 3 2 a free to vibrate cylinder with an attached filament in this section we investigate the viv of a cylinder attached with a filament the vibration responses of the cylinder are studied by varying the reduced velocity which is defined as u u f s d where f s is the first natural frequency of the elastic mounted cylinder the vibration response of cylinder a y is normalized with the cylinder diameter d all simulations are carried out at a fixed natural frequency f s 0 2 of the cylinder we note that we vary the reduced velocity u by changing the incoming fluid velocity u in fig 7 we present the vibration and the corresponding frequency responses of the cylinder for various filament lengths the results for a bare cylinder by both numerical simulation and experiments zhou et al 2011 are also included it is observed that the maximum vibration response of the bare cylinder is about 0 5d which is very close to the previous experiment zhou et al 2011 while occurring at u 4 5 by comparing to u 6 7 in the experiment zhou et al 2011 we conjecture that the derivation is due to the different reynolds number in the experiments zhou et al 2011 with the order of 10000 it is interesting to find that the maximum vibration is increased by attaching a filament they are a y 0 722 at u 6 for the filament length of l 1 d and a y 0 71 at u 10 for l 2 d respectively in the meanwhile the resonance region becomes broader and it is shifted to larger reduced velocities which is more profound for the longer filament i e l 2 d in specific the resonance region is located at 5 u 10 for the filament length of l d and 5 u 25 for l 2 d correspondingly the dominant frequencies for both cases are locked into the natural frequency f s as shown in the right panel of fig 7 moreover in the bare cylinder the vibration response is always symmetric with respect to the equilibrium position resulted in a zero mean displacement a y however for the cylinder attached with a filament it is seen that there is a vibration defection resulted in a positive negative mean displacement a y at relatively larger u e g u 8 for l d and u 14 for l 2 d furthermore we find that the trend of cylinder vibration amplitude is related to the flapping patterns of the attached filament figs 8 and 9 presents the dynamic response of the filament tip under various reduced velocities with various filament length at the high vibration amplitude of cylinder i e u 6 l d and u 8 l 2 d the corresponding filament flaps very widely and it is across zero balance position this greatly increases the wind ward surface of the cylinder filament system leading to a large oscillating cylinder vibration while at the suppressed region of the cylinder i e u 4 12 14 l d and u 16 l 2 d the corresponding filament is mostly flapping to one side with small vibration therefore the effect of filament on the cylinder vibration is weak the flow patterns have also been greatly altered with the existence of the filament as shown in fig 10 the bare cylinder wake is associated with a 2s mode where negative vorticity and positive ones are aligned in two rows as they travel downstream for l d a p s mode dominates the wake at the maximum vibration response see fig 11 for l 2 d the flow wake is composed of 2p modes see fig 12 compared to a bare cylinder the wake is more widened in the cross flow direction for those with filaments which is consistent to the corresponding vibration responses as for the cases apart from the resonance region or with small vibration responses the wake presents the classical vortex street as shown in fig 13 by examining the drag and lift coefficients we find that the effect of the filament can actually reduce the drag though the vibrations are not suppressed as shown in fig 14 here we should point out that the forces include the contribution from both the cylinder and the filament specifically the maximum drag coefficient is reduced by 10 for l d u 6 while it is reduced by 36 for l 2 d u 10 4 conclusion in the present work we apply penalty ibm method to simulate the flow past a cylinder with a flexible filament we find that for a static cylinder both the mean drag force and the fluctuation amplitude of the lift force on the cylinder can be reduced by increasing the length or the rigidity of the filament this is because that a long filament can delay the vortex shedding in the cylinder wake further downstream and a more rigid filament can recover the pressure in the wake when the cylinder is free to move the vibration response of a cylinder with attached filament is still a typical viv but with a higher amplitude response by comparing to a bare cylinder in the meanwhile the existence of a filament can lead to a broader resonance region and this phenomena becomes more remarkable and the resonance region is shifted to larger reduced velocities for l 2d however the drag force coefficient is still reduced by attaching the filament the maximum drag coefficient is suppressed by 10 with l d and the drag is reduced by 36 with l 2d by examining the flow pattern the cylinder wake presents a p s mode for filament length of l d and 2p mode for l 2d at the maximum vibration responses acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledges

22684,solas probabilistic damage stability regulations assess the ship safety level through the attained subdivision index which is a probabilistic measure of ship survivability combining in principle the probability of flooding of groups of compartments and the corresponding conditional survivability the s factor however the present solas framework does not embed a probabilistic model for the extent of collision damage below the waterline a worst case approach is therefore used for the s factor when there are horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline this leads to a systematic underestimation of the ship survivability in presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline and it prevents an effective assessment of the impact of such boundaries to make a step forward the paper presents a probabilistic model for the extent of damage below the waterline derived from statistical analysis of collision accidents data from this model a u factor is defined and it is described how the u factor could be straightforwardly embedded in the solas framework in combination with p factor r factor and v factor to consistently account for horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline thus avoiding the need for using the worst case approach an example application is reported to quantitatively assess the effect of the u factor keywords collision damage ship stability extent of damage flooding probability solas 1 introduction probabilistic damage stability regulations established by the international maritime organization imo in the framework of the international convention for the safety of life at sea solas assess the ship safety level through the attained subdivision index determined in principle by combining the probability of flooding of each possible group of compartment s with the conditional survivability measured through the s factor imo 2018 however from the perspective of probabilistic modelling present solas is unfortunately not complete in fact in assuming damages due to collision solas embeds probabilistic models for the longitudinal position of damage for the damage length and for the damage penetration which lead to the present analytical formulations for p factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 1 1 and for r factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 1 2 the embedded probabilistic models are basically a variation of those originally developed in the framework of the project harmonisation of rules and design rationale harder lützen 2001 2002 solas also embeds a probabilistic model regarding the distribution of the vertical position of the upper limit of damage above the waterline which corresponds to the v factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 1 information on the development of the v factor have been provided by lützen 2001 2002 and tagg et al 2002 however the present solas framework does not embed any probabilistic description for the distribution of the vertical extent of damage below the waterline to compensate for this missing element a worst case approach is used in solas for the determination of the s factor when there are horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 msc 281 85 imo 2008 such conservative approach is based on the combination of the v factor with the minimum s factor considering all possible damages involving different horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline by its very nature the use of this worst case approach leads in general to a systematic underestimation of the actual ship survivability and it may also lead to a misinterpretation of the impact of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline in addition the lack of a complete probabilistic modelling for the vertical extent of damage in the solas framework prevents the development of a consistent non zonal approach for collision damages if this is to be based only on the assumptions underlying present solas see bulian et al 2016 for a description of a non zonal approach in case of grounding damages in order to address the identified limitation of the present solas framework this paper presents a u factor derived from statistical analysis of collision accidents data which could be straightforwardly embedded in the solas framework to account for horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline avoiding the need for the use of present worst case approach in the following first the analysis of collision accidents data with consequent modelling of the damage extent below the waterline is presented afterwards the proposed u factor is introduced and an explanation is provided on how it can be readily and seamlessly embedded in the present solas framework the developed approach is then applied on a sample vessel and the effect of the introduction of the developed u factor on the attained subdivision indices partial and global is assessed some concluding remarks are finally provided 2 collision accidents data analysis and probabilistic modelling of damage extent below the waterline scope of the analysis presented herein is to provide a probabilistic modelling for the damage extent below the waterline starting from collision accidents data to this end use is made of data from the harder accidents database as updated in the goal based damage stability goalds project bulian and francescutto 2010 mains 2010 imo 2012 in the following first an overview is given of the database used for the analysis then the statistical analysis and the associated probabilistic modelling for the extent of collision damage below the waterline are presented 2 1 overview of the database the goalds database contains among others data regarding damage characteristics as recorded from collision accidents bulian and francescutto 2010 mains 2010 imo 2012 the goalds database is the result of the update of the previous harder database which was originally used for the development of solas 2009 lützen 2001 2002 for consistency with the present solas approach data from the database have been used after a series of filtering in accordance with the approach used during goalds bulian and francescutto 2010 imo 2012 filtering levels as used in goalds are summarised in table 1 while more information can be found in the cited references herein in particular data filtered at filtering level 05 have been used as starting point for the present study with specific reference to the present study the available dataset contains information regarding the ship s length between perpendiculars breadth and draught before casualty as well as information regarding damage length damage penetration vertical distance from baseline to the lowest point of the damage and maximum vertical damage height measured from the lowest point not all data entries are complete for all accidents leading to a general fragmentation of the information it is also recalled that according to bulian and francescutto 2010 and imo 2012 following also the harder approach in the statistical analysis of damages due to collision multiple breaches from the same accident were considered as separate breaches for consistency reasons the same approach has been followed also in the present analysis some further filtering of the data was carried out in this study to arrive at the final dataset used in the analysis first a series of additional checks were carried out regarding the reported draught before casualty some recorded damages were found to report inconsistent data ids 47 532 580 621 665 1170 1186 3001 and it was therefore decided to omit them from the subsequent analysis implicitly present solas framework assumes that breaches due to collision are always crossing the waterline imo 2008 i e that the breach has the upper limit above and the lower limit below the actual calculation waterline as a result the transversal section of a solas collision damage can be represented as shown in fig 1 in the figure z u l p and z l l p represent the vertical coordinates of the upper and of lower limit of potential damage respectively the coordinate z 0 m is conventionally assumed to correspond to the ship bottom the coordinate z corresponds to the waterline at which the potential damage penetration l y p is measured and in fig 1 z coincides with the ship draught d the coordinates referred to as x m i n p and x m a x p in fig 1 correspond to the aft and forward limit respectively of the potential damage in longitudinal direction the x axis is assumed to be oriented from stern to bow herein similarly to bulian et al 2016 the wording potential is used to indicate that in principle the damage can extend also outside the vessel limits since the solas damage is assumed to be always crossing the waterline it follows that z l l p d z u l p for consistency with this assumption as a final filtering of the dataset before the analysis only cases with sufficient data to unambiguously identify that the damage was crossing the waterline have been retained to this end the necessary data are the ship draught before casualty the vertical distance from the baseline to the lowest point of the damage and the maximum vertical damage height measured up from the lowest point this final filtering led to a set of data comprising a total of 152 entries since damage distributions in present solas are common to passenger and cargo vessels the analysis considers data from both types of ships an overview of the distribution of main ship characteristics length between perpendiculars l s h i p breadth b ship draught before casualty t from the considered set of data is reported in fig 2 2 2 comparison between v factor and accidents data in order to check whether the available dataset could be considered to be a sufficiently consistent source of information for developing a model for the vertical extent of damage below the waterline a first check has been carried out considering the vertical extent of damage above the waterline according to solas the cumulative distribution of the vertical position of the upper limit of potential damage above the waterline i e the vertical extent of potential damage above the waterline corresponds to the v factor the vertical extent of potential damage above the waterline h a w p can be related to the ship draught d and to the vertical position of upper limit of potential damage z u l p as follows 1 h a w p z u l p d hence the v factor calculated at a generic height h above the waterline v h corresponds to 2 v h pr h a w p h c d f h a w p h where pr indicates the probability of an event and c d f h a w p is the cumulative distribution of the random variable h a w p in order to keep as far as possible a differentiation between accident data and the model to be potentially embedded in the solas framework herein the symbol d is used to refer to a generic draught to be eventually used in damage stability calculations in accordance with the solas nomenclature whereas the symbol t is meant to specifically refer to the draught before casualty as recorded in the database of collision accidents data since no information is available in the database regarding the total height of the vessel it was not possible to directly differentiate between damages which could have potentially extended above the maximum height of the vessel which are thus limited by the maximum height of the vessel and damages which were instead not affected by this limitation lützen 2001 2002 tagg et al 2002 as a result the analysis has herein been carried out assuming that the fraction of cases for which the upper limit of damage is limited by the total height of the vessel is sufficiently small to be neglected this basically corresponds to assuming the equivalence between the upper limit of potential damage z u l p and the measured upper limit of damage z u l in the analysis of data results from the comparison between available data and v factor are shown in fig 3 as indicated before in the figure z u l is the measured vertical position of upper limit of damage and t is the reported ship draught before casualty accordingly the variable 3 h a w z u l t is the vertical extent of damage above the waterline from the comparison in fig 3 it can be noticed that the solas v factor represents a good approximation of the distribution obtained from the accidents database the v factor seems to slightly underestimate the probability of occurrence of very high damages above the waterline with approximately 4 of the data extending above the maximum solas limit assumed through the v factor i e 12 5 m overall it can be concluded that there is a good agreement between the database and the probabilistic model embedded in the solas v factor providing some confidence in the use of the database for the development of a probabilistic model for the extent of damage below the waterline as described in the next section 2 3 statistical analysis and probabilistic modelling in order to develop a probabilistic model for the extent of damage below the waterline first an exploratory data analysis has been carried out which led to some main outcomes the quantity under analysis is the nondimensional vertical position of the lower limit of damage i e z l l t a scatter plot of z l l t versus the ship draught t is shown in fig 4 together with the available data results from a statistical analysis are also reported the analysis has been carried out by partitioning the data into different draught intervals and performing afterwards a statistical analysis of the data within each interval the selection of the number of intervals was done with the intention of balancing two conflicting objectives namely a the capability of identifying possible nonlinear trends which calls for an increase in the number of intervals and b the need for reducing the uncertainty of the conditional estimators within each interval which calls for an increase in the number of points within each interval and thus a reduction in the number of intervals from a preliminary screening and considering the not very large size of the sample 152 points in total at most it was considered to be an appropriate balance to partition the data into five different draught intervals i k k 1 5 where each interval contains approximately 20 of the available data i e approximately 30 samples intervals are indicated in the plot and their boundaries are indicated by vertical dashed lines then within each interval the mean values of t and of z l l t have been estimated from the data solid line with circle markers in the plot together with associated 95 confidence intervals for the mean horizontal and vertical error bars in the plot in addition a series of percentile levels have also been estimated within each interval i k k 1 5 for z l l t dashed lines in the plot in order to provide an indication of the behaviour of the conditional distribution of z l l t each statistical quantity associated to z l l t within each interval has been plotted at a value of draught corresponding to the mean conditional draught within the interval for instance for the interval i 2 in fig 4 the conditional mean value of t within the interval is 4 8 m and all statistics relevant to i 2 conditional mean value of z l l t and percentile levels have been plotted at that coordinate along the horizontal axis in addition to data conditional to each interval i k the marginal estimated mean value of z l l t has also been reported dotted line some dependence can be observed in fig 4 between the nondimensional vertical position of lower limit of damage z l l t and the ship draught t however this dependence is not monotonic with respect to t although there appears to be a slight global tendency towards an increase of z l l t with increasing t this observed behaviour is also confirmed by the spearman s rank correlation coefficient which assesses the presence of monotonic relationships between couples of random variables in fact for the data in fig 4 it is relatively small and positive r s 0 144 it is however underlined that the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is not appropriate for providing indications on non monotonic associations in general it is therefore considered that a simplified modelling where z l l t is independent of the ship draught could sufficiently represent the available data for practical purposes a similar analysis has then been carried out to check the dependence of the nondimensional extent of damage below the waterline 4 h b w t t z l l t and the dimensional vertical extent of damage above the waterline h a w see 3 results of the analysis are reported in fig 5 and the figure reports data similarly to fig 4 from fig 5 it can be observed that the nondimensional extent of damage below the waterline h b w t is basically independent of the dimensional vertical extent of damage above the waterline h a w in this case the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is almost zero r s 0 002 indicating a basic lack of monotonic relationship the same considerations hold of course for the dimensionless vertical position of lower limit of damage z l l t because 5 z l l t 1 h b w t and the corresponding analysis is shown in fig 6 as a direct consequence of the transformation 5 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient for data in fig 6 is simply the opposite of that calculated for data in fig 5 r s 0 002 it has therefore been concluded that a simplified modelling could be developed where the dimensionless vertical position of the lower limit of damage from ship bottom z l l t is statistically independent of the dimensional vertical extent of damage above the waterline h a w the cumulative distribution of h a w as said corresponds to the v factor two additional similar analyses have been carried out to assess the dependence of the dimensionless extent of damage below the waterline h b w t on the dimensionless damage penetration l y b l y is the dimensional damage penetration and b is the ship breadth as reported in the accidents database and on the dimensionless damage length l x l s h i p l x is the dimensional damage length and l s h i p is the ship length as reported in the accidents database the analysis of h b w t versus l y b is shown in fig 7 while the analysis of h b w t versus l x l s h i p is shown in fig 8 with reference to figs 7 and 8 it is noted that information on damage penetration l y and damage length l x is not available for all cases this leads to a total number of samples which reduces from the basic sample size of 152 to 109 in fig 7 and to 139 in fig 8 according to fig 7 there is a clear tendency for h b w t to increase as l y b increases indicating that damages characterised by larger dimensionless penetrations are also associated with larger dimensionless extent of damage below the waterline in fact in this case the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is larger compared to the previous analyses r s 0 416 a similar trend is visible also in fig 8 where there is a clear tendency for h b w t to increase as l x l s h i p increases indicating that damages characterised by larger dimensionless lengths also tend to be associated with larger dimensionless extent of damage below the waterline the increasing trend is quite consistent with the exception of the last interval i 5 however due to the large width of i 5 in terms of dimensionless damage lengths results should be considered with caution data in fig 8 are associated with a positive spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s 0 288 which confirms the observed trend however in order to develop a sufficiently simple approach which could be directly embedded in the existing solas probabilistic damage ship stability framework the observed statistical dependences have been neglected in the model presented hereinafter in this respect it is noted that a more complex probabilistic model for the extent of damage below the waterline was actually developed by bulian et al 2017 this model accounts for the observed dependence between the dimensionless extent of damage below the waterline and the dimensionless damage penetration fig 7 whereas it does not account for the dependence on the dimensionless damage length fig 8 however the implementation of this probabilistic model in the solas zonal framework has been prevented by analytical difficulties furthermore this more advanced model and the simplified model presented hereinafter when comparatively applied led to almost identical attained subdivision indices lindroth et al 2017 in addition it is to be recalled that present solas modelling assumes that the vertical extent of damage above the waterline is fully independent from all the other damage characteristics as a result it has eventually been considered sufficient to rely on the simpler model presented in the following this simplified model can be referred to as fully independent model since the random variable z l l t is considered to be independent from all the other damage characteristics similarly to what solas already assumes as said for the vertical extent of damage above the waterline from the observation of the available data it was also concluded that the distribution of z l l t could be sufficiently well approximated by a linear trapezoidal probability density function pdf with corresponding quadratic cumulative distribution cdf having the following general form 6 p d f ζ l l f 0 2 1 f 0 ζ l l c d f ζ l l f 0 ζ l l 1 f 0 ζ l l 2 f 0 0 2 ζ l l z l l t 0 1 the free parameter f 0 is linked to the mean value μ ζ l l of ζ l l z l l t as follows 7 μ ζ l l e ζ l l 2 3 f 0 6 f 0 4 6 μ ζ l l f 0 0 2 μ ζ l l 1 3 2 3 ζ l l z l l t where e indicates the usual expected value operator the analysis of data led to an estimated mean value μ ˆ ζ l l and corresponding 95 confidence interval as reported in table 2 see also fig 5 taking into account 7 and the results in table 2 it was considered sufficiently accurate to set 8 f 0 1 4 μ ζ l l 13 30 0 433 and to use the distribution in 6 as probabilistic model for z l l p d fig 9 compares the distribution of the dimensionless vertical position of lower limit of damage according to the developed model and that obtained from the accidents database results in the figure indicate that the developed model despite its simplicity provides a good representation of the available data 3 embedding obtained results in the solas framework the u factor the fully independent probabilistic model for the lower limit of collision damage as developed in section 2 can potentially be used to readily and seamlessly update the existing solas framework by avoiding the use of the worst case approach which is presently embedded in the determination of the s factor in presence of horizontal subdivisions below the waterline solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 this can be conveniently accomplished by defining a new factor which can be used similarly to the existing v factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 1 and which together with the p factor r factor and v factor allows the determination of the probability of flooding of a group of compartment s in presence of combined longitudinal transversal and horizontal subdivision when horizontal subdivision boundaries exist above and or below the considered calculation waterline this factor herein referred to for simplicity as u factor corresponds to the cumulative distribution function cdf of the vertical position of the lower limit of potential damage from the ship bottom see 6 8 and fig 9 and it has therefore the following expression 9 u z f 0 z d 1 f 0 z d 2 f 0 1 4 z 0 d the above expression for the u factor assumes that the vertical position of the ship bottom is conventionally placed at z 0 m the use of the u factor in combination with standard solas factors p r and v will be explained herein first through some example applications by making reference to the representative geometry reported in fig 10 the figure illustrates half of a notional transversal section with combined horizontal and longitudinal subdivision in addition it is assumed that the geometry in fig 10 represents the transversal section of a zone extending longitudinally between two generic coordinates x 1 and x 2 with corresponding p factor from solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 being p x 1 x 2 in general the probability of flooding of a group of compartment s in presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the considered waterline can be determined by the usual application of p factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 1 1 r factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 1 2 and v factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 with a further multiplicative term which is determined on the basis of the u factor defined in 9 as a first example the probability of flooding only the compartment w03 is considered which can be calculated as 10 pr flooding w 03 pr s i d e p x 1 x 2 r x 1 x 2 b 1 v h 3 z 3 d 1 u z 2 in equation 10 pr s i d e is the probability that the damage occurs to the specified side and according to solas framework it can be taken as 0 5 for each side alternatively if the side of the vessel is deterministically fixed then pr s i d e is to be taken equal to 1 0 for the considered side and 0 0 for the other the term 1 u z 2 represents the probability that the lower limit of potential damage is above the horizontal subdivision boundary corresponding to the bottom of w03 which is placed at z z 2 it should be reminded that damages are assumed to always cross the waterline therefore the probability that the lower limit of the potential damage is above the waterline is zero as a second example the probability of flooding at the same time compartments w02 w03 and w04 is considered which can be calculated as follows 11 pr flooding w 02 w 03 w 04 pr s i d e p x 1 x 2 r x 1 x 2 b 1 v h 4 z 4 d v h 3 z 3 d u z 2 u z 1 in this case the term u z 2 u z 1 represents the probability that the lower limit of the potential damage is within z 1 and z 2 as a final example the probability of flooding w01 w02 w03 w04 and w05 is considered which can be determined as follows 12 pr flooding w 01 w 02 w 03 w 04 w 05 pr s i d e p x 1 x 2 r x 1 x 2 b 1 1 v h 4 z 4 d u z 1 in this case the term u z 1 represents the probability that the lower limit of potential damage is below the upper limit of compartment w01 which is placed at z z 1 similar expressions are obtained when instead of determining the probability of flooding of groups of w j compartments the interest is on the determination of the probability that also inner m j compartments see fig 10 are involved in the damage in this case it is sufficient to substitute r x 1 x 2 b 1 in 10 12 with r x 1 x 2 b 2 r x 1 x 2 b 1 in accordance with the standard solas zonal approach similarly when the interest is on the probability of damaging up to central c j compartments see fig 10 then r x 1 x 2 b 1 in 10 12 is to be substituted by 1 r x 1 x 2 b 2 similar formulations can be applied for any other specific case and an exhaustive list is reported for the sake of completeness in the appendix in general let us assume that z j j 0 n are the vertical coordinates of the n horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline with z 0 0 m corresponding to the ship bottom and with j increasing with increasing z let us consider a damage case of interest which below the waterline involves all compartments down to the generic k th horizontal subdivision boundary z k the corresponding additional multiplicative term based on the u factor is to be determined as follows 13 u z 1 for k 0 u z k 1 u z k for 0 k n 1 u z n for k n finally the introduction of the u factor allows to avoid the use of the worst case approach solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 for the determination of s factor in presence of horizontal subdivisions below the waterline in fact in the limits of the solas zonal approximations and of the simplifications embedded in the model underlying the u factor the u factor allows to determine a probability of flooding for each damage case also in presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline this is instead not possible within the present solas framework as a result for each generic calculation draught the corresponding partial attained index can be determined simply as 14 a c i pr s i d e i p r v u i s i with c l p s where the summation is extended to all damage cases for the considered calculation draught the term pr s i d e i p r v u i is the probability of flooding for the i th damage case as determined by the damage side probability pr s i d e i and corresponding appropriate combination of p factor r factor v factor and u factor the term s i is the s factor calculated for the considered damage case accordingly with the introduction of the u factor there is no longer need to define a minimum s factor as it is instead presently done in solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 and the possible presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the calculation waterline can be consistently accounted for in the determination of the attained index 4 application in order to assess the effect of the introduction of the developed probabilistic model for the lower limit of damage through the u factor an application was carried out on a sample vessel the vessel used in the calculations is a panamax cruise ship with subdivision length of approximately 230 m carrying a number of persons onboard in the range of 2000 and with a required index r 0 77 according to solas 2009 the vessel is fitted with horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline in the application the partial attained subdivision indices a c c l p s and the global attained subdivision

attained indices qualitatively this is of course an expected result in fact in case of damage cases limited by horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline the present solas methodology uses the worst case approach for the determination of s factor whereas the introduction of the proposed u factor leads to a fair weighting of the s factors according to the probabilities of flooding the corresponding group of compartment s eventually quantitatively for the considered sample vessel the introduction through the u factor of a probabilistic model for the lower limit of potential damage has a clear impact on the attained subdivision indices 5 conclusions present solas damage stability regulations embed probabilistic models for the longitudinal position the length the transversal penetration and the vertical extent above the waterline of collision damage the corresponding models represent the bases for the derivation of analytical formulae of solas p factor r factor and v factor however although in solas the damage is assumed to be crossing the waterline and although it is recognised that the damage can have different extents below the waterline no probabilistic model is embedded in the regulations in this respect as a result it is not possible within present solas to actually determine the probability of flooding a group of compartment s when there is a horizontal subdivision boundary below the waterline to cope with this limitation solas uses a worst case approach often referred to as damages of lesser extent for the calculation of the s factor where the minimum s factor is considered among all the possible damages involving different horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline although this is a practical approach it is however not probabilistically sound furthermore when horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline are present this approach by its very nature leads in general to an underestimation of the actual ship survivability moreover the use of such an approach may also lead to a misinterpretation of the impact of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline to address this problem the paper has presented the development of a probabilistic model addressing the extent of collision damages below the waterline with the aim of linking the model with the existing solas framework the model was developed on the basis of damage characteristics from the goalds accidents database consistently with present solas regulations which use harmonized probabilistic models of damage characteristics for passenger and cargo ships data from all ships were considered in the analysis simplifications have been introduced during the analysis in order to come up with a simple probabilistic model with straightforward introduction in the existing solas zonal framework while keeping a good representativeness of the data according to the developed probabilistic model a new factor has been defined denoted as u factor which corresponds to the cumulative distribution of the vertical position from the ship bottom of the lower limit of damage this new u factor can potentially be used together with existing solas p factor r factor and v factor in order to consistently calculate the probability of flooding a group of compartment s also in presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline the use of the u factor is very similar basically specular to that of the v factor and the introduction of the u factor in the existing solas formulation is straightforward in this respect examples have been shown on how to determine the probability of flooding of group of compartment s accounting for horizontal subdivision boundaries both above and below the waterline and the general formulation for the use of the u factor has also been reported the developed methodology has been tested on a sample cruise ship qualitatively results indicate the expected increase of all attained indices partial and global eventually quantitatively for the considered sample vessel the introduction through the u factor of a probabilistic model for the lower limit of potential damage has a clear impact on the attained subdivision indices eventually the developed u factor could provide a complement to the existing solas framework making it a truly fully probabilistic one this could lead to a more consistent estimation of the ship survivability level by avoiding the underestimation of ship survivability as obtained by the present application of the worst case approach for the s factor in presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline moreover the extension of the existing solas framework with the introduction of a consistent probabilistic model for the extent of damage below the waterline may also lead to a better more properly informed interpretation of the impact of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline on the overall performance of the ship in damaged condition in this context the implementation of the u factor could be of effective use in the comparison of design alternatives with different subdivision layouts although this topic has not been addressed in this paper it is definitely an important open topic for future research in addition the introduction of a probabilistic model for the lower limit of damage allows the implementation of a non zonal approach for collision damages which is instead prevented if relying only on the present solas framework due to such missing element overall the introduction of a probabilistic model for the lower limit of damage and the associated u factor could represent an improvement of the current solas framework it is finally underlined that the present paper addressed a very specific topic i e the development of a probabilistic model for the lower limit of collision damage below the waterline and its introduction in the solas zonal framework it is believed that the presented development could represent an advance compared to the present situation with respect to consistency and with respect to effectiveness in practical application of the solas probabilistic damage stability framework nevertheless it is also recognised that the existing solas framework embeds a number of simplifications and approximations which are calling for further research and development on more advanced methods for ship survivability assessment in damaged condition there is in fact significant space for an evolution of the probabilistic damage stability framework by

22684,solas probabilistic damage stability regulations assess the ship safety level through the attained subdivision index which is a probabilistic measure of ship survivability combining in principle the probability of flooding of groups of compartments and the corresponding conditional survivability the s factor however the present solas framework does not embed a probabilistic model for the extent of collision damage below the waterline a worst case approach is therefore used for the s factor when there are horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline this leads to a systematic underestimation of the ship survivability in presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline and it prevents an effective assessment of the impact of such boundaries to make a step forward the paper presents a probabilistic model for the extent of damage below the waterline derived from statistical analysis of collision accidents data from this model a u factor is defined and it is described how the u factor could be straightforwardly embedded in the solas framework in combination with p factor r factor and v factor to consistently account for horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline thus avoiding the need for using the worst case approach an example application is reported to quantitatively assess the effect of the u factor keywords collision damage ship stability extent of damage flooding probability solas 1 introduction probabilistic damage stability regulations established by the international maritime organization imo in the framework of the international convention for the safety of life at sea solas assess the ship safety level through the attained subdivision index determined in principle by combining the probability of flooding of each possible group of compartment s with the conditional survivability measured through the s factor imo 2018 however from the perspective of probabilistic modelling present solas is unfortunately not complete in fact in assuming damages due to collision solas embeds probabilistic models for the longitudinal position of damage for the damage length and for the damage penetration which lead to the present analytical formulations for p factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 1 1 and for r factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 1 2 the embedded probabilistic models are basically a variation of those originally developed in the framework of the project harmonisation of rules and design rationale harder lützen 2001 2002 solas also embeds a probabilistic model regarding the distribution of the vertical position of the upper limit of damage above the waterline which corresponds to the v factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 1 information on the development of the v factor have been provided by lützen 2001 2002 and tagg et al 2002 however the present solas framework does not embed any probabilistic description for the distribution of the vertical extent of damage below the waterline to compensate for this missing element a worst case approach is used in solas for the determination of the s factor when there are horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 msc 281 85 imo 2008 such conservative approach is based on the combination of the v factor with the minimum s factor considering all possible damages involving different horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline by its very nature the use of this worst case approach leads in general to a systematic underestimation of the actual ship survivability and it may also lead to a misinterpretation of the impact of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline in addition the lack of a complete probabilistic modelling for the vertical extent of damage in the solas framework prevents the development of a consistent non zonal approach for collision damages if this is to be based only on the assumptions underlying present solas see bulian et al 2016 for a description of a non zonal approach in case of grounding damages in order to address the identified limitation of the present solas framework this paper presents a u factor derived from statistical analysis of collision accidents data which could be straightforwardly embedded in the solas framework to account for horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline avoiding the need for the use of present worst case approach in the following first the analysis of collision accidents data with consequent modelling of the damage extent below the waterline is presented afterwards the proposed u factor is introduced and an explanation is provided on how it can be readily and seamlessly embedded in the present solas framework the developed approach is then applied on a sample vessel and the effect of the introduction of the developed u factor on the attained subdivision indices partial and global is assessed some concluding remarks are finally provided 2 collision accidents data analysis and probabilistic modelling of damage extent below the waterline scope of the analysis presented herein is to provide a probabilistic modelling for the damage extent below the waterline starting from collision accidents data to this end use is made of data from the harder accidents database as updated in the goal based damage stability goalds project bulian and francescutto 2010 mains 2010 imo 2012 in the following first an overview is given of the database used for the analysis then the statistical analysis and the associated probabilistic modelling for the extent of collision damage below the waterline are presented 2 1 overview of the database the goalds database contains among others data regarding damage characteristics as recorded from collision accidents bulian and francescutto 2010 mains 2010 imo 2012 the goalds database is the result of the update of the previous harder database which was originally used for the development of solas 2009 lützen 2001 2002 for consistency with the present solas approach data from the database have been used after a series of filtering in accordance with the approach used during goalds bulian and francescutto 2010 imo 2012 filtering levels as used in goalds are summarised in table 1 while more information can be found in the cited references herein in particular data filtered at filtering level 05 have been used as starting point for the present study with specific reference to the present study the available dataset contains information regarding the ship s length between perpendiculars breadth and draught before casualty as well as information regarding damage length damage penetration vertical distance from baseline to the lowest point of the damage and maximum vertical damage height measured from the lowest point not all data entries are complete for all accidents leading to a general fragmentation of the information it is also recalled that according to bulian and francescutto 2010 and imo 2012 following also the harder approach in the statistical analysis of damages due to collision multiple breaches from the same accident were considered as separate breaches for consistency reasons the same approach has been followed also in the present analysis some further filtering of the data was carried out in this study to arrive at the final dataset used in the analysis first a series of additional checks were carried out regarding the reported draught before casualty some recorded damages were found to report inconsistent data ids 47 532 580 621 665 1170 1186 3001 and it was therefore decided to omit them from the subsequent analysis implicitly present solas framework assumes that breaches due to collision are always crossing the waterline imo 2008 i e that the breach has the upper limit above and the lower limit below the actual calculation waterline as a result the transversal section of a solas collision damage can be represented as shown in fig 1 in the figure z u l p and z l l p represent the vertical coordinates of the upper and of lower limit of potential damage respectively the coordinate z 0 m is conventionally assumed to correspond to the ship bottom the coordinate z corresponds to the waterline at which the potential damage penetration l y p is measured and in fig 1 z coincides with the ship draught d the coordinates referred to as x m i n p and x m a x p in fig 1 correspond to the aft and forward limit respectively of the potential damage in longitudinal direction the x axis is assumed to be oriented from stern to bow herein similarly to bulian et al 2016 the wording potential is used to indicate that in principle the damage can extend also outside the vessel limits since the solas damage is assumed to be always crossing the waterline it follows that z l l p d z u l p for consistency with this assumption as a final filtering of the dataset before the analysis only cases with sufficient data to unambiguously identify that the damage was crossing the waterline have been retained to this end the necessary data are the ship draught before casualty the vertical distance from the baseline to the lowest point of the damage and the maximum vertical damage height measured up from the lowest point this final filtering led to a set of data comprising a total of 152 entries since damage distributions in present solas are common to passenger and cargo vessels the analysis considers data from both types of ships an overview of the distribution of main ship characteristics length between perpendiculars l s h i p breadth b ship draught before casualty t from the considered set of data is reported in fig 2 2 2 comparison between v factor and accidents data in order to check whether the available dataset could be considered to be a sufficiently consistent source of information for developing a model for the vertical extent of damage below the waterline a first check has been carried out considering the vertical extent of damage above the waterline according to solas the cumulative distribution of the vertical position of the upper limit of potential damage above the waterline i e the vertical extent of potential damage above the waterline corresponds to the v factor the vertical extent of potential damage above the waterline h a w p can be related to the ship draught d and to the vertical position of upper limit of potential damage z u l p as follows 1 h a w p z u l p d hence the v factor calculated at a generic height h above the waterline v h corresponds to 2 v h pr h a w p h c d f h a w p h where pr indicates the probability of an event and c d f h a w p is the cumulative distribution of the random variable h a w p in order to keep as far as possible a differentiation between accident data and the model to be potentially embedded in the solas framework herein the symbol d is used to refer to a generic draught to be eventually used in damage stability calculations in accordance with the solas nomenclature whereas the symbol t is meant to specifically refer to the draught before casualty as recorded in the database of collision accidents data since no information is available in the database regarding the total height of the vessel it was not possible to directly differentiate between damages which could have potentially extended above the maximum height of the vessel which are thus limited by the maximum height of the vessel and damages which were instead not affected by this limitation lützen 2001 2002 tagg et al 2002 as a result the analysis has herein been carried out assuming that the fraction of cases for which the upper limit of damage is limited by the total height of the vessel is sufficiently small to be neglected this basically corresponds to assuming the equivalence between the upper limit of potential damage z u l p and the measured upper limit of damage z u l in the analysis of data results from the comparison between available data and v factor are shown in fig 3 as indicated before in the figure z u l is the measured vertical position of upper limit of damage and t is the reported ship draught before casualty accordingly the variable 3 h a w z u l t is the vertical extent of damage above the waterline from the comparison in fig 3 it can be noticed that the solas v factor represents a good approximation of the distribution obtained from the accidents database the v factor seems to slightly underestimate the probability of occurrence of very high damages above the waterline with approximately 4 of the data extending above the maximum solas limit assumed through the v factor i e 12 5 m overall it can be concluded that there is a good agreement between the database and the probabilistic model embedded in the solas v factor providing some confidence in the use of the database for the development of a probabilistic model for the extent of damage below the waterline as described in the next section 2 3 statistical analysis and probabilistic modelling in order to develop a probabilistic model for the extent of damage below the waterline first an exploratory data analysis has been carried out which led to some main outcomes the quantity under analysis is the nondimensional vertical position of the lower limit of damage i e z l l t a scatter plot of z l l t versus the ship draught t is shown in fig 4 together with the available data results from a statistical analysis are also reported the analysis has been carried out by partitioning the data into different draught intervals and performing afterwards a statistical analysis of the data within each interval the selection of the number of intervals was done with the intention of balancing two conflicting objectives namely a the capability of identifying possible nonlinear trends which calls for an increase in the number of intervals and b the need for reducing the uncertainty of the conditional estimators within each interval which calls for an increase in the number of points within each interval and thus a reduction in the number of intervals from a preliminary screening and considering the not very large size of the sample 152 points in total at most it was considered to be an appropriate balance to partition the data into five different draught intervals i k k 1 5 where each interval contains approximately 20 of the available data i e approximately 30 samples intervals are indicated in the plot and their boundaries are indicated by vertical dashed lines then within each interval the mean values of t and of z l l t have been estimated from the data solid line with circle markers in the plot together with associated 95 confidence intervals for the mean horizontal and vertical error bars in the plot in addition a series of percentile levels have also been estimated within each interval i k k 1 5 for z l l t dashed lines in the plot in order to provide an indication of the behaviour of the conditional distribution of z l l t each statistical quantity associated to z l l t within each interval has been plotted at a value of draught corresponding to the mean conditional draught within the interval for instance for the interval i 2 in fig 4 the conditional mean value of t within the interval is 4 8 m and all statistics relevant to i 2 conditional mean value of z l l t and percentile levels have been plotted at that coordinate along the horizontal axis in addition to data conditional to each interval i k the marginal estimated mean value of z l l t has also been reported dotted line some dependence can be observed in fig 4 between the nondimensional vertical position of lower limit of damage z l l t and the ship draught t however this dependence is not monotonic with respect to t although there appears to be a slight global tendency towards an increase of z l l t with increasing t this observed behaviour is also confirmed by the spearman s rank correlation coefficient which assesses the presence of monotonic relationships between couples of random variables in fact for the data in fig 4 it is relatively small and positive r s 0 144 it is however underlined that the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is not appropriate for providing indications on non monotonic associations in general it is therefore considered that a simplified modelling where z l l t is independent of the ship draught could sufficiently represent the available data for practical purposes a similar analysis has then been carried out to check the dependence of the nondimensional extent of damage below the waterline 4 h b w t t z l l t and the dimensional vertical extent of damage above the waterline h a w see 3 results of the analysis are reported in fig 5 and the figure reports data similarly to fig 4 from fig 5 it can be observed that the nondimensional extent of damage below the waterline h b w t is basically independent of the dimensional vertical extent of damage above the waterline h a w in this case the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is almost zero r s 0 002 indicating a basic lack of monotonic relationship the same considerations hold of course for the dimensionless vertical position of lower limit of damage z l l t because 5 z l l t 1 h b w t and the corresponding analysis is shown in fig 6 as a direct consequence of the transformation 5 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient for data in fig 6 is simply the opposite of that calculated for data in fig 5 r s 0 002 it has therefore been concluded that a simplified modelling could be developed where the dimensionless vertical position of the lower limit of damage from ship bottom z l l t is statistically independent of the dimensional vertical extent of damage above the waterline h a w the cumulative distribution of h a w as said corresponds to the v factor two additional similar analyses have been carried out to assess the dependence of the dimensionless extent of damage below the waterline h b w t on the dimensionless damage penetration l y b l y is the dimensional damage penetration and b is the ship breadth as reported in the accidents database and on the dimensionless damage length l x l s h i p l x is the dimensional damage length and l s h i p is the ship length as reported in the accidents database the analysis of h b w t versus l y b is shown in fig 7 while the analysis of h b w t versus l x l s h i p is shown in fig 8 with reference to figs 7 and 8 it is noted that information on damage penetration l y and damage length l x is not available for all cases this leads to a total number of samples which reduces from the basic sample size of 152 to 109 in fig 7 and to 139 in fig 8 according to fig 7 there is a clear tendency for h b w t to increase as l y b increases indicating that damages characterised by larger dimensionless penetrations are also associated with larger dimensionless extent of damage below the waterline in fact in this case the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is larger compared to the previous analyses r s 0 416 a similar trend is visible also in fig 8 where there is a clear tendency for h b w t to increase as l x l s h i p increases indicating that damages characterised by larger dimensionless lengths also tend to be associated with larger dimensionless extent of damage below the waterline the increasing trend is quite consistent with the exception of the last interval i 5 however due to the large width of i 5 in terms of dimensionless damage lengths results should be considered with caution data in fig 8 are associated with a positive spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s 0 288 which confirms the observed trend however in order to develop a sufficiently simple approach which could be directly embedded in the existing solas probabilistic damage ship stability framework the observed statistical dependences have been neglected in the model presented hereinafter in this respect it is noted that a more complex probabilistic model for the extent of damage below the waterline was actually developed by bulian et al 2017 this model accounts for the observed dependence between the dimensionless extent of damage below the waterline and the dimensionless damage penetration fig 7 whereas it does not account for the dependence on the dimensionless damage length fig 8 however the implementation of this probabilistic model in the solas zonal framework has been prevented by analytical difficulties furthermore this more advanced model and the simplified model presented hereinafter when comparatively applied led to almost identical attained subdivision indices lindroth et al 2017 in addition it is to be recalled that present solas modelling assumes that the vertical extent of damage above the waterline is fully independent from all the other damage characteristics as a result it has eventually been considered sufficient to rely on the simpler model presented in the following this simplified model can be referred to as fully independent model since the random variable z l l t is considered to be independent from all the other damage characteristics similarly to what solas already assumes as said for the vertical extent of damage above the waterline from the observation of the available data it was also concluded that the distribution of z l l t could be sufficiently well approximated by a linear trapezoidal probability density function pdf with corresponding quadratic cumulative distribution cdf having the following general form 6 p d f ζ l l f 0 2 1 f 0 ζ l l c d f ζ l l f 0 ζ l l 1 f 0 ζ l l 2 f 0 0 2 ζ l l z l l t 0 1 the free parameter f 0 is linked to the mean value μ ζ l l of ζ l l z l l t as follows 7 μ ζ l l e ζ l l 2 3 f 0 6 f 0 4 6 μ ζ l l f 0 0 2 μ ζ l l 1 3 2 3 ζ l l z l l t where e indicates the usual expected value operator the analysis of data led to an estimated mean value μ ˆ ζ l l and corresponding 95 confidence interval as reported in table 2 see also fig 5 taking into account 7 and the results in table 2 it was considered sufficiently accurate to set 8 f 0 1 4 μ ζ l l 13 30 0 433 and to use the distribution in 6 as probabilistic model for z l l p d fig 9 compares the distribution of the dimensionless vertical position of lower limit of damage according to the developed model and that obtained from the accidents database results in the figure indicate that the developed model despite its simplicity provides a good representation of the available data 3 embedding obtained results in the solas framework the u factor the fully independent probabilistic model for the lower limit of collision damage as developed in section 2 can potentially be used to readily and seamlessly update the existing solas framework by avoiding the use of the worst case approach which is presently embedded in the determination of the s factor in presence of horizontal subdivisions below the waterline solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 this can be conveniently accomplished by defining a new factor which can be used similarly to the existing v factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 1 and which together with the p factor r factor and v factor allows the determination of the probability of flooding of a group of compartment s in presence of combined longitudinal transversal and horizontal subdivision when horizontal subdivision boundaries exist above and or below the considered calculation waterline this factor herein referred to for simplicity as u factor corresponds to the cumulative distribution function cdf of the vertical position of the lower limit of potential damage from the ship bottom see 6 8 and fig 9 and it has therefore the following expression 9 u z f 0 z d 1 f 0 z d 2 f 0 1 4 z 0 d the above expression for the u factor assumes that the vertical position of the ship bottom is conventionally placed at z 0 m the use of the u factor in combination with standard solas factors p r and v will be explained herein first through some example applications by making reference to the representative geometry reported in fig 10 the figure illustrates half of a notional transversal section with combined horizontal and longitudinal subdivision in addition it is assumed that the geometry in fig 10 represents the transversal section of a zone extending longitudinally between two generic coordinates x 1 and x 2 with corresponding p factor from solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 being p x 1 x 2 in general the probability of flooding of a group of compartment s in presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the considered waterline can be determined by the usual application of p factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 1 1 r factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 1 2 and v factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 with a further multiplicative term which is determined on the basis of the u factor defined in 9 as a first example the probability of flooding only the compartment w03 is considered which can be calculated as 10 pr flooding w 03 pr s i d e p x 1 x 2 r x 1 x 2 b 1 v h 3 z 3 d 1 u z 2 in equation 10 pr s i d e is the probability that the damage occurs to the specified side and according to solas framework it can be taken as 0 5 for each side alternatively if the side of the vessel is deterministically fixed then pr s i d e is to be taken equal to 1 0 for the considered side and 0 0 for the other the term 1 u z 2 represents the probability that the lower limit of potential damage is above the horizontal subdivision boundary corresponding to the bottom of w03 which is placed at z z 2 it should be reminded that damages are assumed to always cross the waterline therefore the probability that the lower limit of the potential damage is above the waterline is zero as a second example the probability of flooding at the same time compartments w02 w03 and w04 is considered which can be calculated as follows 11 pr flooding w 02 w 03 w 04 pr s i d e p x 1 x 2 r x 1 x 2 b 1 v h 4 z 4 d v h 3 z 3 d u z 2 u z 1 in this case the term u z 2 u z 1 represents the probability that the lower limit of the potential damage is within z 1 and z 2 as a final example the probability of flooding w01 w02 w03 w04 and w05 is considered which can be determined as follows 12 pr flooding w 01 w 02 w 03 w 04 w 05 pr s i d e p x 1 x 2 r x 1 x 2 b 1 1 v h 4 z 4 d u z 1 in this case the term u z 1 represents the probability that the lower limit of potential damage is below the upper limit of compartment w01 which is placed at z z 1 similar expressions are obtained when instead of determining the probability of flooding of groups of w j compartments the interest is on the determination of the probability that also inner m j compartments see fig 10 are involved in the damage in this case it is sufficient to substitute r x 1 x 2 b 1 in 10 12 with r x 1 x 2 b 2 r x 1 x 2 b 1 in accordance with the standard solas zonal approach similarly when the interest is on the probability of damaging up to central c j compartments see fig 10 then r x 1 x 2 b 1 in 10 12 is to be substituted by 1 r x 1 x 2 b 2 similar formulations can be applied for any other specific case and an exhaustive list is reported for the sake of completeness in the appendix in general let us assume that z j j 0 n are the vertical coordinates of the n horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline with z 0 0 m corresponding to the ship bottom and with j increasing with increasing z let us consider a damage case of interest which below the waterline involves all compartments down to the generic k th horizontal subdivision boundary z k the corresponding additional multiplicative term based on the u factor is to be determined as follows 13 u z 1 for k 0 u z k 1 u z k for 0 k n 1 u z n for k n finally the introduction of the u factor allows to avoid the use of the worst case approach solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 for the determination of s factor in presence of horizontal subdivisions below the waterline in fact in the limits of the solas zonal approximations and of the simplifications embedded in the model underlying the u factor the u factor allows to determine a probability of flooding for each damage case also in presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline this is instead not possible within the present solas framework as a result for each generic calculation draught the corresponding partial attained index can be determined simply as 14 a c i pr s i d e i p r v u i s i with c l p s where the summation is extended to all damage cases for the considered calculation draught the term pr s i d e i p r v u i is the probability of flooding for the i th damage case as determined by the damage side probability pr s i d e i and corresponding appropriate combination of p factor r factor v factor and u factor the term s i is the s factor calculated for the considered damage case accordingly with the introduction of the u factor there is no longer need to define a minimum s factor as it is instead presently done in solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 and the possible presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the calculation waterline can be consistently accounted for in the determination of the attained index 4 application in order to assess the effect of the introduction of the developed probabilistic model for the lower limit of damage through the u factor an application was carried out on a sample vessel the vessel used in the calculations is a panamax cruise ship with subdivision length of approximately 230 m carrying a number of persons onboard in the range of 2000 and with a required index r 0 77 according to solas 2009 the vessel is fitted with horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline in the application the partial attained subdivision indices a c c l p s and the global attained subdivision index 15 a 0 2 a l 0 4 a p 0 4 a s have been calculated according to two approaches on the one hand calculations were carried out according to standard solas using therefore the worst case approach on the other hand calculations were carried out by using the solas zonal approach supplemented with the u factor developed herein from the obtained results the variation of attained indices in comparison with present solas as given by the introduction of the u factor has been determined for each attained index as follows 16 δ a c a c s o l a s u f a c t o r a c s o l a s with c l p s δ a a s o l a s u f a c t o r a s o l a s 0 2 δ a l 0 4 δ a p 0 4 δ a s table 3 reports the attained indices and the variation of indices for the three calculation draughts and in terms of global index fig 11 provides a graphical representation of the variation of indices at each draught δ a l δ a p δ a s and of the corresponding variation of the global attained index δ a results in fig 11 show an increase of all attained indices qualitatively this is of course an expected result in fact in case of damage cases limited by horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline the present solas methodology uses the worst case approach for the determination of s factor whereas the introduction of the proposed u factor leads to a fair weighting of the s factors according to the probabilities of flooding the corresponding group of compartment s eventually quantitatively for the considered sample vessel the introduction through the u factor of a probabilistic model for the lower limit of potential damage has a clear impact on the attained subdivision indices 5 conclusions present solas damage stability regulations embed probabilistic models for the longitudinal position the length the transversal penetration and the vertical extent above the waterline of collision damage the corresponding models represent the bases for the derivation of analytical formulae of solas p factor r factor and v factor however although in solas the damage is assumed to be crossing the waterline and although it is recognised that the damage can have different extents below the waterline no probabilistic model is embedded in the regulations in this respect as a result it is not possible within present solas to actually determine the probability of flooding a group of compartment s when there is a horizontal subdivision boundary below the waterline to cope with this limitation solas uses a worst case approach often referred to as damages of lesser extent for the calculation of the s factor where the minimum s factor is considered among all the possible damages involving different horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline although this is a practical approach it is however not probabilistically sound furthermore when horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline are present this approach by its very nature leads in general to an underestimation of the actual ship survivability moreover the use of such an approach may also lead to a misinterpretation of the impact of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline to address this problem the paper has presented the development of a probabilistic model addressing the extent of collision damages below the waterline with the aim of linking the model with the existing solas framework the model was developed on the basis of damage characteristics from the goalds accidents database consistently with present solas regulations which use harmonized probabilistic models of damage characteristics for passenger and cargo ships data from all ships were considered in the analysis simplifications have been introduced during the analysis in order to come up with a simple probabilistic model with straightforward introduction in the existing solas zonal framework while keeping a good representativeness of the data according to the developed probabilistic model a new factor has been defined denoted as u factor which corresponds to the cumulative distribution of the vertical position from the ship bottom of the lower limit of damage this new u factor can potentially be used together with existing solas p factor r factor and v factor in order to consistently calculate the probability of flooding a group of compartment s also in presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline the use of the u factor is very similar basically specular to that of the v factor and the introduction of the u factor in the existing solas formulation is straightforward in this respect examples have been shown on how to determine the probability of flooding of group of compartment s accounting for horizontal subdivision boundaries both above and below the waterline and the general formulation for the use of the u factor has also been reported the developed methodology has been tested on a sample cruise ship qualitatively results indicate the expected increase of all attained indices partial and global eventually quantitatively for the considered sample vessel the introduction through the u factor of a probabilistic model for the lower limit of potential damage has a clear impact on the attained subdivision indices eventually the developed u factor could provide a complement to the existing solas framework making it a truly fully probabilistic one this could lead to a more consistent estimation of the ship survivability level by avoiding the underestimation of ship survivability as obtained by the present application of the worst case approach for the s factor in presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline moreover the extension of the existing solas framework with the introduction of a consistent probabilistic model for the extent of damage below the waterline may also lead to a better more properly informed interpretation of the impact of horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline on the overall performance of the ship in damaged condition in this context the implementation of the u factor could be of effective use in the comparison of design alternatives with different subdivision layouts although this topic has not been addressed in this paper it is definitely an important open topic for future research in addition the introduction of a probabilistic model for the lower limit of damage allows the implementation of a non zonal approach for collision damages which is instead prevented if relying only on the present solas framework due to such missing element overall the introduction of a probabilistic model for the lower limit of damage and the associated u factor could represent an improvement of the current solas framework it is finally underlined that the present paper addressed a very specific topic i e the development of a probabilistic model for the lower limit of collision damage below the waterline and its introduction in the solas zonal framework it is believed that the presented development could represent an advance compared to the present situation with respect to consistency and with respect to effectiveness in practical application of the solas probabilistic damage stability framework nevertheless it is also recognised that the existing solas framework embeds a number of simplifications and approximations which are calling for further research and development on more advanced methods for ship survivability assessment in damaged condition there is in fact significant space for an evolution of the probabilistic damage stability framework by

with reference to the geometry in fig 10 table a 1 table a 2 and table a 3 report an exhaustive list of damage cases with associated flooding probabilities as determined by the solas zonal approach
