16695,worldwide the production of plastics is increasing and plastic pollution in aquatic environments is a major global concern under natural conditions plastic weathers to smaller pieces called microplastics mp which come in various shapes with fibers often being the most common in freshwater sediments the hyporheic zone an ecotone between surface and groundwater is important for the transport and fate of all mp particles the main metabolic pathways in rivers take place in the hyporheic zone and are driven by a diverse microbial community the objective of this study was to investigate in situ whether the presence of pet fibers in riverbed sediments affects patterns of colonization and the seasonal dynamics of microbial metabolic activities in the hyporheic zone the effects of the presence of pet on microbial metabolism were evaluated in situ over a month colonization study and over a year seasonal study by measuring total protein content tpc and microbial respiration as respiratory electron transport system activity etsa and by community level physiological profiling clpp additionally pet fibers were examined under a scanning electron microscope sem and isotopic analysis δ 13c of pet was performed after one year of exposure to field conditions the findings demonstrated that during colonization and biofilm formation and also over the seasons the date had a large and significant impact on biofilm growth and activity while pet presence slightly suppressed microbial biomass tpc and respiratory activity etsa overall microbial activity was repressed in the presence of pet fibers but there was a higher capacity for the utilization of complex synthetic polymer substrates i e tween 40 which have previously been linked to polluted environments sem micrographs showed diverse microbial communities adhering to pet fibers but little surface deterioration similarly isotopic analysis suggested little deterioration of pet fibers after one year of in situ conditions the study indicated that pet fibers present in riverbed sediments could have impacts on the metabolic functioning in rivers and thus affect their self cleaning ability

environmental concern worldwide the production of plastics had increased from 1 5 million tonnes in 1950 to 360 million tonnes in 2018 plasticseurope 2019 due to their durability and the low recycling rate plastics have now been accumulating in landfills and the natural environment for almost a century under natural conditions plastic waste weathers to smaller pieces called microplastics particles 5 mm mp which thus more easily enter food webs and serve as vectors for toxic chemical compounds thompson et al 2004 or pathogens wu et al 2019 in concordance with global production rates high and low density polyethylene hd ld pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc are the most common polymers found in the environment wagner et al 2014 in freshwater sediments the main types of mp according to a review by yang et al 2021 are pe pp and ps but pet is also frequently found in river and lake sediments across the globe various shapes of microplastics including fragments foams fibers and films have been detected in freshwater sediments but the fibers probably closely connected to the washing of textiles are those most commonly occurring in freshwater sediments yang et al 2021 in waste waters which are among the most significant sources of freshwater pollution the most frequently found mps are pet fibers and irregularly shaped pe particles ziajahromi et al 2017 the major sources of mp particles in freshwater are secondary mp generated by the breakdown of larger items such as single use packaging tires and fibers these enter freshwaters due to poor waste management through surface and agricultural runoff or as wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents wong et al 2020 matjašič et al 2021 despite the fact that wwtps are highly efficient in retaining mp with 78 98 of mp removed in the primary treatment due to the high volume of treated effluents released to recipient water bodies every day the mp contamination received into aquatic ecosystems is still considerable prata 2018 wong et al 2020 the main metabolic pathways in rivers take place within the riverbeds in the so called hyporheic zone orghidan 2010 here surface water organic matter particles organisms and pollutants enter the subsurface sediments mix with the groundwater and are in close contact with the biofilms that overgrow sediment particles boulton et al 1998 hancock et al 2005 in the hyporheic zone biofilms generally include heterotrophs and chemolithotrophs embedded in a polysaccharide matrix battin et al 2016 freshwater sediments are considered sinks for mp for example a study by scherer et al 2020 found that the concentration of mp in sediments is higher than that in water columns for both rivers and lakes moreover frei et al 2019 demonstrated that riverbed sediments of up to 0 6 m i e the hyporheic zone can be an accumulation area for mp of smaller size 50 μm and pointed out that hyporheic exchange is a potential mechanism for smaller mp particles to enter an underlying aquifer and thus contaminate the groundwater similarly a field stream study by drummond et al 2020 indicates that in streambed sediments hyporheic exchange is important for the transport and fate i e deposition retention and long term accumulation of all mp particles 100 μm irrespective of polymer type several studies have indicated that pollution with mp affects aquatic biofilms miao et al 2021 demonstrated substrate specific functional diversity for biofilms growing on pet or pvc substrates taken from three rivers they used ecoplates biolog usa as detectors for the metabolic functioning of microbial communities and observed the differences in metabolic profiles between biofilms growing on either pet or pvc substrates in all three rivers by measuring the intensity of utilization of 31 substrates from the ecoplates an interesting laboratory study by seeley et al 2020 clearly indicates that the amendment of sediments with either pe pvc puf or pla microplastics alters the composition of the sediment microbial community and the nitrogen cycling processes li et al 2020 found a decrease in the α diversity of microorganisms from river sediments under the impacts of mp and significant effects on the structure and functioning of the microbial community it is well known that loss of bacterial species richness can have a strongly negative impact on ecosystem functioning and services delgado baquerizo et al 2016 for example for heterotrophic bacteria to degrade complex compounds the bacteria need to create a syntrophic metabolic chain this means that one bacteria uses the products of catabolism from another as a source of carbon santisi et al 2015 losses in microbial diversity may result in the disruption of these metabolic chains because for some species resources become available only if another species degrades and consumes a part of that resource delgado baquerizo et al 2016 further studies are needed to fully understand how loss and changes in microbial structural and functional diversity due to the presence of plastic pollution impact the ecosystem processes in riverbed sediments after disturbances such as drought or high water levels the colonization and re colonization of natural sediments or anthropogenic debris by biofilm takes place within a few days and the rate increases with warmer temperatures villanueva et al 2011 hoellein et al 2014 the development of freshwater biofilms and their composition and functional diversity also depends on hydrological shear stress rickard et al 2004 hyporheic exchange rates simčič and mori 2007 substrate surface and type of substrate wang et al 2020 available nutrients in the surrounding water griebler et al 2002 and pollution with mp li et al 2020 niu et al 2021 the complex microbial communities i e biofilms living here are the driving force behind the ecosystem processes and biogeochemical cycles arias real et al 2020 and are therefore an essential element of the self purification capacity of rivers fischer et al 2005 battin et al 2016 harrison et al 2018 alterations in microbial communities can affect carbon cycling arias andres et al 2019 to obtain information on the structure of the biofilms related to plastic or mp pollution studies of environmental genetic material metagenomics are increasingly popular but they are expensive and require extensive knowledge of bioinformatics alternatively quick and simple methods such as community level physiological profiling clpp can broaden the understanding of in situ ecological and ecosystem functions as based on community metabolic activity and thus provide a quick way to assess the ecological health of a freshwater system in addition they can provide simple indicators of the impacts of mp on biofilm functioning weber and legge 2010 the objective of this study was to investigate in situ whether the presence of pet fibers in riverbed sediments affects patterns of colonization and the seasonal dynamics of microbial metabolic activities in the hyporheic zone this can be achieved by using either simple respiratory electron transport system activity etsa or more complex community level physiological profiling clpp measures of microbial functioning the specific aims of this research were 1 to investigate the colonization patterns of natural biofilms in plastic free sediments and to compare them with colonization in pet contaminated natural sediments 2 to observe seasonal dynamics in biofilm functioning in both pet polluted and unpolluted sediments over a one year period and 3 to observe whether pet fibers exposed to natural conditions in the hyporheic zone for a year showed any indications of deterioration or biodegradation new biofilm development is usually driven by extreme events such as flooding or droughts over the different seasons this study provides initial insights into the impacts of pet pollution on hyporheic biofilm metabolic activity and functioning following such events 2 methods 2 1 in situ experimental design the study was carried out in the pre alpine gravel bed river kamniška bistrica a left tributary of the sava river in north central slovenia se europe the study river emerges at a 630 m elevation in the southern kamniško savinjske alps and is 33 km long with a catchment area of 539 km2 in the upper part of the catchment kamniška bistrica is a typical undisturbed pre alpine river while in the lower reaches it is strongly impacted by urbanization intensive agriculture and wastewater treatment effluents a 100 m river stretch between the two settlements beričevo and videm 46 05 18 4 n 14 37 33 1 e 268 m altitude was selected as a study site within the study stretch six sites which included pools p1 3 deeper areas with slower water and runs r1 3 areas with faster water were selected to encompass the spatial heterogeneity of the environmental parameters within the riverbed such as hydraulic conductivity temperature redox conditions and water chemistry table 1 at each site three types of artificial substrates control low pet high pet pre prepared in the laboratory as described below were inserted into the riverbed the substrates were inserted at depths of 20 to 40 cm and then covered with natural sediments on 28th of june 2019 d0 the natural riverbed sediments are composed of cobbles pebbles gravel sand and silt with cobbles and gravel as the dominant particles a temperature logger vemco innovasea usa was inserted together with the artificial substrates the artificial substrates in pockets and bags were inserted perpendicular to the subsurface stream flow during the colonization the first four samplings i e collections of the pre prepared substrates were carried out in weekly to monthly intervals d1 one week d2 two weeks d3 a month d4 two months after that the samplings were carried out seasonally d5 autumn 2019 d6 winter 2019 d7 spring 2020 d8 summer 2020 fig 1 concurrently river water levels surface water temperatures conductivity and oxygen concentrations were measured using field probes multi 3430 wtw germany in addition surface water samples were collected for laboratory analysis of dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen ntot analyzed at the slovenian forestry institute 2 2 artificial substrate preparation sediments for the preparation of the artificial substrates were taken from the same site where the in situ experiment was later to be carried out about 15 kg of sediments were washed and sieved in the laboratory to obtain sediments with particle sizes between 2 and 4 mm and between 1 and 2 mm these two size classes were mixed in a ratio of 2 1 before filling the pockets with them so as to standardize the sediment surface which is one of the most important factors when estimating biofilm activity i e simčič and mori 2007 since the pockets were buried and thus fixed in the riverbed sediments they were not exposed to being continuously washed out by the surface water and the loss of smaller fraction 2 mm in the sediments was minor store bought fabric was used for the colonization study and characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir as polyethylene terephthalate pet as described in matjašič et al 2020 the fabric was washed in a washing machine at 40 c and exposed to sunlight for about a month after exposure the fabric was cut into 120 120 mm pieces for use in the experiment galvanized net 2 2 mm mesh size was cut into bigger i e 350 400 mm for the bags and smaller pieces i e 160 120 and 160 180 mm for the pockets the pieces were folded in half and stapled together with galvanized staples to construct the pockets later to be filled with the artificial substrate or the larger bags to be filled with the pockets placing the pockets into the bags was to prevent the loss of the artificial substrates during the one year study in the event of floods or increased discharge for each sampling site p1 3 r1 3 three bags of size 35 40 cm each containing 13 smaller pockets were prepared these three bags contained the control c the low pet 1p and the high pet 5p pockets separately the control pockets c were filled with 50 g of washed and sieved sediment the low pet pockets 1p were filled with a mixture of the washed and sieved sediment and pet fabric in the ratio 10 versus 0 2 50 g of sediment 1 g pet and the high pet 5p in the ratio 10 versus 0 7 70 g of sediment 5 g pet hence we had an experimental set up with low 1p and high 5p amounts of pet fiber present we used more sediment for the high pet treatment to maintain the conditions at the microscale similar to natural conditions in the hyporheic zone i e a complex network of interstitial pores between sediment grains of different sizes the artificial substrates were then autoclaved twice within a two day window at 121 5 c for 15 min prior to application in the field 2 3 laboratory work on each sampling date one pocket was extracted from each bag c 1p 5p and from each site p 1 3 r 1 3 altogether obtaining 18 pockets in the laboratory the pockets were cut with scissors and the sediments were mixed well with a spoon before analysis part of a sediment 2 g was used immediately for community level physiological profiling clpp while the remaining sediment was frozen at 80 c for later use with other analyzes pom tpc etsa described in sections 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 respectfully all samples were frozen for at least a week prior to analysis once thawed part of the sediment 8

ultrasonic homogenizer 4710 cole parmer vernon il usa for 2 min and then put into a centrifuge 4 min 10 000 rpm at 0 c refrigerated centrifuge sigma 2k15 st louis mo usa to collect the microorganisms from biofilms overgrowing the sediment particles the supernatant containing the microorganisms was further used for tpc and etsa analyzes the rest of the thawed sediment 10 g was used to determine particulate organic matter pom and dry weight of sediments dw dw was used for the calculations of tpc and etsa samples of pet fibers were taken on the last date after one year of in situ exposure d8 summer for isotopic analysis and sem micrographs 2 4 particulate organic matter pom the amount of particulate organic matter pom in the sediments was determined by loss on ignition loi for the pom measurements approximately 10 g of thawed sediment was placed in a ceramic bowl and weighed to obtain wet weight ww next the sediments were incubated at 105 c until constant in weight and then weighed again to obtain dry weight dw the sediments were then put into an oven at 520 c for 2 h to ignite the organic substance when cooled the bowls with sediments were weighed again to obtain loss on ignition pom was expressed as gpom kgdw 1 2 5 total protein content tpc total protein content tpc was used as a proxy for microbial biomass it was measured using pierce bca protein assay kit thermo fisher scientific usa the assay is a spectrophotometric assay based on the alkaline reduction of the cupric to the cuprous ion by the protein followed by chelation and color development by the bicinchoninic acid bca reagent lovrien and matulis 2005 the bca copper complex is water soluble and exhibits a strong linear relationship between absorbance at 562 nm and increasing protein concentrations standards and reagents were prepared in accordance with manufacturers instructions the sample or standard 25 μl was thoroughly mixed with the working reagent 200 μl on the microplate and was then incubated for 30 min at 37 c the microplate was cooled to room temperature and then the absorbance was immediately measured at 562 nm with spectrofluorometer synergymx biotek instruments usa the results were expressed as µg protein per g of dry sediment µg prot g sed 1 2 6 respiratory electron transport system activity etsa the respiratory electron transport system activity etsa estimates overall microbial respiratory activity by detecting the activities of dehydrogenases and cytochromes within the electron transport system that biochemically controls cell respiration debeljak et al 2017 etsa was measured by applying a modified assay adapted from packard 1971 the supernatant obtained from thawed samples exposed to the homogenizer and centrifuged as described above was poured into a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube on ice and later microtiter plates were used for every sample 30 µl was put into each of two adjacent wells while a third well was left empty the blank next 150 µl of substrate solution nadh nadph was carefully added to each well followed by 50 µl of int iodonitrotetrazolium chloride reagent the plate was incubated at 20 c in the dark for 30 min after incubation 50 µl of stopper solution was added to all wells finally 30 μl of the corresponding sample was added to all the blanks the absorbance was measured immediately with a microplate reader

profiling clpp was carried out using the biolog ecoplates assay biolog california usa which provides information on community functioning the assay was developed by garland and mills 1991 for soil samples and includes direct incubation of environmental samples in microtiter plates containing 31 different carbon sources nutrients and a redox dye the assay enables fast characterization of microbial community metabolism by spectrophotometric measurement of the intensity of pre prepared substrate utilization which includes carbohydrates polymers carboxylic and ketonic acids phenolic compounds amino acids and amines amides table 2 among the polymer substrates on the plate are also synthetic polymers such as tween 40 and tween 80 increased utilization of these was previously shown to be typical for polluted environments e g sala 2006 thus making them suitable indicators of pollution after each sampling 2 g of fresh sediment collected from the pockets exposed to different treatments c 1p 5p and from the six sites p1 3 r1 3 n 18 was put into a marked sterilized glass beaker 100 ml on an electro balance sartorius bp 210 s germany and 20 ml of chilled ringer solution ringer solution ¼ strength tablets sigma aldrich 1 tablet in 500 ml deionized water was added the beakers were transferred to an ultrasonic bath elmasonic p elma singen germany for 1 min 37 khz 30 each beaker was gently shaken while the solution was poured into two tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 rpm at 4 c next 150 μl of supernatant was transferred using multichannel pipettes to ecoplates and the absorbance of each well was measured using a spectrofluorometer synergymx biotek instruments usa at 590 nm on the same day and again after 24 48 and 72 h between the measurements the plates were incubated in the dark at 20 c the ecoplate consists of 96 wells divided into three groups each containing one blank well and 31 different carbon sources table 2 meaning the experiment is conducted in triplicate on one plate raw absorbance values measured for the substrate wells on each plate were corrected by the mean absorbance of the control wells the three wells with no substrate for clpp the substrate utilization metric measured after 72 h was used because most absorbance readings were below 2 according to weber and legge 2010 absorbance values taken later during the incubation can provide more information but the values must not exceed 2 as higher values contribute to measurement error 2 8 isotopic analysis the untreated reference pet fibers were compared to the pet fibers exposed to in situ conditions for a year the pet fibers from the field were rinsed with deionized water to remove the majority of the organic matter including the biofilm so as not to interfere with the results about 0 5 mg of material was weighed in tin capsules the isotopic composition of carbon δ 13c was determined using a europa 20 20 continuous flow irms anca sl preparation module the determination of isotopic composition followed combustion of the capsules in a hot furnace at 1000 c the products generated were reduced in a cu tube 600 c where excess o2 was absorbed h2o was trapped on a drying column composed of mgclo4 gasses were separated on a chromatographic column and ionized iaea ch 3 24 724 0 041 ch 7 32 151 0 050 reference materials and sugar with a value of

microscope fegsem verios g4 thermo fisher scientific usa at sem accelerating voltage of 5 kv multiple micrographs were taken due to limited publishing space only the most relevant micrographs are shown 2 10 statistical analysis the data from the first four dates d1 d4 were used to investigate the biofilm colonization process colonization under the three different treatments control c presence of low 1p and high amounts 5p of pet fibers in sediments the data from the next four dates d5 d8 were used to investigate whether there were any differences between the treatments over the four seasons d5 autumn d6 winter d7 spring d8 summer two way anova with treatment c 1p 5p and date as factors was conducted on data for pom tpc and etsa tukey s hsd honest significant difference post hoc method was used to determine the significance of the factors and interactions all data were transformed using log10 x 1 in order to achieve the anova assumptions and were analyzed separately for colonization and seasonal difference all significance was p 0 05 unless specified otherwise the clpp absorbance data were transformed using log10 x 1 and investigated using multivariate non metric multidimensional scaling nmds separately for colonization and the seasonal study bray curtis dissimilarity was used to calculate distance and visualize distribution patterns the input data for the nmds included the data on absorbance from all three treatments c 1p 5p separately for colonization and the seasonal study however due to the better visibility of variability between samples in metabolic functioning the control low and high pet treatments are presented in three separate ordination diagrams for the colonization fig 4a and seasonal study fig 4b respectively to test for significant differences between the dates and the differences between treatments analysis of similarity anosim was conducted to search for the substrate utilization that contributed the most to the differences between groups i e dates for individual treatments similarity percentage analysis simper was used heatmaps were constructed to demonstrate the intensity of individual substrate utilization under different treatments and dates heatmaps are graphical representations of data where the intensity of substrate utilization is depicted by color a two way anova treatment date and tukey s hsd post hoc were performed on data for individual substrate utilization and groups of substrates e g polymers carbohydrates etc table 2 the same transformed data as for the clpp analysis were used the analyzes were carried out using r studio software r core team 2019 using packages such as tidyverse wickham et al 2019 vegan jari oksanen et al 2020 and heatmaply galili et al 2017 simper was performed using past 3 22 hammer et al 2001 3 results and discussion 3 1 colonization patterns of river biofilms under different treatments presence or absence of pet fibers the biofilm presence on artificial substrates i e treated 1p 5p and untreated control c sediments measured as total protein content tpc and microbial respiratory electron transport system activity etsa over the first two weeks and until two months d1 d4 could already be detected after one week d1 of exposure to natural conditions figs 2 a and 3 a hinting that microbial colonization is fast in riverbed sediments no significant differences were observed between treatments c 1p 5p while the date d1 d4 was a statistically significant factor tpc two way anova f 48 381 p 0 001 etsa two way anova f 41 915 p 0 001 differences were significant between all date combinations for both tpc and etsa except for the last two dates d3 d4 tukey s post hoc test however despite the insignificant differences between treatments generally lower mean tpc and etsa were observed on the sediments impacted by both low 1p and high amounts 5p of pet fibers on all sampling dates figs 2a and 3a the lower total protein content tpc and respiratory electron transport system activity etsa observed on all dates in the presence of pet fibers indicated that pet possibly suppresses both the process of biofilm colonization and the development of mature biofilms a measurement of respiratory electron transport system activity etsa is an ecological factor that is well studied in aquatic ecosystems it is relatively simple to measure and is sensitive to ecosystem stress simčič et al 2015 it has been used to highlight the importance of stressors such as temperature and increased nutrient loads on microbial respiration in the hyporheic zone debeljak et al 2017 mori et al 2018 and it would seem that it also responds to stress due to pet pollution during the presence of plastic pollution substances can be released that have toxic effects on microorganisms enabling only a few adapted bacteria to grow in their presence li et al 2020 or such substances can have a general inhibitory effect on the respiratory activity of microorganisms since antimicrobial additives are often used in the production of polyester pet fibers al balakocy and shalaby 2017 this may have influenced the microbial community in this study the comparison of microbial community functioning i e clpp between different treatments c 1p 5p during colonization d1 d4 using nmds fig 4 a stress 0 1159 indicated that the presence of pet suppressed shifts in microbial community functioning during colonization the differences between samples from different dates were smaller under the presence of pet in comparison to the controls especially in the case of high pet presence however the analysis of similarity anosim which tested for significant differences in microbial functioning between dates and treatments revealed the importance of the dates d1 d4 r 0 3905 p 0 05 but not of the treatments r 0 0203 p 0 102 for the variability in microbial functioning still differences between dates for the individual treatments were bigger for the control anosim r 0 7233 p 0 001 relative to the treatments anosim 1p r 0 5579 p 0 001 and 5p r 0 2523 p 0 001 suggesting the suppression of functional shifts in microbial communities during colonization in the presence of pet fibers the simper analysis indicated that the substrates that contributed the most to the differences between the sample date were similar in the control and treatment 1p and included itaconic acid gamma hydroxybutyric acid and l phenylalanine while under treatment 5p the utilization of l phenylalanine 2 hydroxybenzoic acid and alfa cyclodextrin contributed the most to the variability between the sample date the former two substrates utilization was substantially lower in treatment 5p the utilization of l phenylalanine was slightly higher under treatment 5p while the last two substrates were substantially more intensively utilized under treatment 5p appendix a itaconic acid is an ingredient known in medicine as salicylic acid ncbi 2021a phenylalanine is an essential aromatic amino acid for humans and is important in the structure and function of many proteins and enzymes its l form is incorporated into proteins ncbi 2021b alfa cyclodextrin is one of the most common natural cyclodextrins gidwani and vyas 2015 with high water solubility the ability to form complexes and relatively resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis its potential applications are increasing especially in the food industry li et al 2014 the community composition and functioning of stream biofilms are driven by an array of environmental factors that are usually highly interconnected in response to the physical and chemical structure of the streambed environment with its variability biofilms adapt and evolve which may lead to changes in biofilm carbon metabolism battin et al 2016 but only to a certain extent certain previous studies suggest that plastics have an inhibitory effect on stream biofilms miao et al 2019 compared natural and mp pe and pp substrates in terms of community structure and microbial function their results suggest that although mp serves as a new substrate for microbial colonization it decreases the richness and diversity of biofilms compared to those inhabiting natural substrates mp probably alters microbial survival strategies and negatively affects their ecological functions and other biogeochemical processes further miao et al 2021 show that biofilms on pet have lower capacities and carbon metabolism rates and the lowest diversity compared to those on glass or pvc li et al 2020 demonstrated that mp reduced the α diversity of microorganisms and had a significant effect on the structure of microbial communities additionally li et al 2020 demonstrated differences in microbial diversity community structure and functioning when comparing sediments with low or high amounts of mp seeley et al 2020 assessed bacterial community diversity based on miseq sequencing of 16s rrna genes communities exposed to pe and puf expressed the most variation over time as opposed to the control and pla communities which exhibited minimal changes over time a study by niu et al 2021 showed a significant difference between bacterial communities from mps sieved from river sediments and sediments using absorbance readings from ecoplates a comparison of the individual substrate utilization during colonization and between treatments and dates was visualized using heatmaps fig 5 a under pet stress some substrates were poorly utilized in comparison to the control one such case was carbohydrate d xylose indicating that pet presence could suppress the capacity of the microbial community for the degradation of allochthonous wood or plant debris containing xylose in contrast other substrates such as tween 40 tween 80 and alpha cyclodextrin were utilized more intensely under pet stress utilization of the substrates pyruvic acid methly ester d glucosaminic acid and glycyl l glutamic acid changed significantly over the dates and the interaction between date and treatment was significant two way anova the intensity of utilization of substrate d xylose gamma hydroxybutyric acid itaconic acid l arginine l asparagine and l serine changed significantly with date and treatment and when in interaction while utilization of tween 40 significantly depended on the type of treatment and was more intense in the presence of higher concentrations of pet tukey s post hoc p 0 001 the polymers included in ecoplates tween 40 c1 tween 80 d1 alfa cyclodextrin e1 and glycogen f1 are complex carbon substrates utilization of complex polymers tween 40 has previously been linked to polluted environments sala et al 2006 oest et al 2018 generally significant differences between treatments were observed for carbohydrates two way anova f 3 602 p 0 05 and carboxylic and ketonic acids two way anova f 5 132 p 0 01 while carbohydrates and the other four substrate groups polymers phenolic compounds amino acids amines amides showed significant differences between dates table 3 in addition for carboxylic and ketonic acids date two way anova f 27 975 p 0 001 and interaction between date and treatment two way anova f 12 756 p 0 001 proved significant the most significant difference in the degradation of carboxylic and ketonic acids was between the control and treatment 5p p 0 01 a large quantity of organic matter and nutrients is delivered to the hyporheic zone by river surface water penetrating the streambed where it becomes trapped and is further decomposed by microbial communities krause et al 2011 zhou et al 2014 in general a high consumption of carbohydrates and carboxylic acids in freshwater sediments has been reported by multiple studies oest et al 2018 melita et al 2019 miao et al 2019 carbohydrates and carboxylic and ketonic acids are important carbon sources for aquatic microorganisms sala et al 2006 arnosti et al 2014 studies consistently report that the presence of plastic lowers the biodiversity of microbial communities miao et al 2019 li et al 2020 seeley et al 2020 miao et al 2021 and this was also indicated in our colonization study 3 2 seasonal dynamics of biofilms under different treatments the presence or absence of pet fibers river systems are highly dynamic environments driven by climate and hydrogeological characteristics and impacted by an array of anthropogenic pressures the river studied has a strong seasonal pattern for discharge rates and water temperatures fig 1 this is also reflected in the water physico chemistry table 1 and consequently also in the biofilm structure and function figs 2b and 3b the highest mean value for tpc was in the autumn and then it gradually decreased exhibiting the lowest values but highest spatial variability in the summer microbial activity measured as etsa was highest in the summer when the variability within the streambed was also the highest for both the tpc and etsa the season was a significant factor tpc two way anova f 31 886 p 0 001 etsa two way anova f 5 178 p 0 01 while both etsa p 0 01 and tpc p 0 001 were significantly different between summer and winter or spring the tpc in summer was also significantly different from that in autumn while there were also significant differences between autumn and spring and between spring and winter the key driver of microbial activity in riverbed sediments is temperature but nutrients and organic carbon are also important for the general functional response of the hyporheic biofilm debeljak et al 2017 mori et al 2018 seasonal changes in temperature discharge and water chemistry were most probably driving the seasonal patterns observed in tpc and etsa in the control sediments in this study the differences in tpc and etsa between the control sediments and the sediments under pet pollution were insignificant but generally lower means for tpc and etsa were observed in the sediments impacted by the pet fibers 1p 5p during all four seasons suggesting as in the colonization study that the presence of pet fibers suppresses the biofilm biomass and respiratory potential throughout the year the least in autumn and the most in summer using clpp for a comparison of microbial functioning between seasons and treatments also revealed that the presence of pet suppressed the seasonal dynamics nmds ordination plots fig 4b stress 0 1944 indicate differences in microbial functioning between the control and treatments 1p and 5p however the microbial utilization of substrates differed significantly between seasons anosim r 0 4214 p 0 001 but not between treatments anosim r 0 0181 p 0 1697 these findings suggest that biofilms growing in the presence of a large quantity of pet fibers are less susceptible to seasonal changes than those in a control treatment the three substrates that contributed the most to the differences between date samples in the control were d xylose l phenylalanine and itaconic acid while in the samples under the pet fiber treatments 1p and 5p alfa cyclodextrin was the most intensively used substrate rather than itaconic acid in addition alfa cyclodextrin was among those substrates contributing most to the differences between the control and the treatments both 1p and 5p appendix a table 1 and thus one of the four polymers contributing the most to the differences between seasons this contribution was highest in the presence of the larger quantity of pet fibers 8 9 versus 4 2 c and 7 6 1p additionally glucose 1 phosphate was present in the simper results for the first 50 of the substrates thus contributing to differences between the samples for both treatments 1p 5p but not for the control this last substrate is a component in glycogen metabolism explaining the lower contribution of glycogen in both instances 1 9 1p and 1 4 5p versus 2 4 in the control as this was probably used as a carbon source and suggests a shift in the metabolic profile of the microbial community glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose acting as its readily mobilized storage form for numerous organisms berg et al 2002 investigation of the heatmaps presenting substrate utilization using ecoplates absorbance readings fig 5b indicated either more intensive utilization of carbon sources dark green or none at all dark red in the treatment with the higher quantity of pet this could be an indication that the community is shifting toward more specialized metabolism and therefore exhibits lower adaptability to newly available substrates melita et al 2019 when observing the separate utilization of substrates during the seasonal study l arginine l asparagine and phenylethyl amine were significantly dependent on the type of treatment and were utilized more intensely in the presence of the higher amount of pet fibers tukey s post hoc p 0 05 utilization of substrates d cellobiose i erythritol d galacturonic acid gamma hydroxybutyric acids glycyl l glutamic acids tween 80 and alfa cyclodextrin were all affected by both date and treatment both polymers tween 80 tukey post hoc p 0 05 and alfa cyclodextrin tukey s post hoc p 0 01 were utilized more intensely in the presence of higher amounts of pet fibers significant differences between treatments were observed for the polymer group two way anova f 3 642 p 0 05 between the control and the highest presence of pet fibers tukey s post hoc p 0 05 additionally the amines amides group showed significant differences between dates and treatments carbohydrates and amino acids showed significant difference between seasons while the other two carboxylic and ketonic acids and phenolic compound showed no significance whatsoever table 3 after a year of exposure to pet fibers bacterial communities had started to utilize the synthetic polymer tween 80 this indicates a shift in metabolic functioning and suggests that the community could adapt to utilizing synthetic polymers the significance of the amines amides group could indicate low nitrogen conditions and the presence of opportunistic classes of bacteria oest et al 2018 seeley et al 2020 3 3 observed changes in pet fibers and δ13c after one year of in situ exposure the surface of untreated reference pet fibers is smooth with occasional small bumps or irregularities presumably arising during manufacture without visible surface overgrowth or deterioration fig 6 despite washing with deionized water diverse microorganisms probably fungal hyphae and bacilli were observed on the pet fibers exposed to in situ conditions for one year this confirms that microorganisms in hyporheic sediments overgrow not only sediments but also pet fibers while the sem micrographs indisputably indicate a diverse biofilm they do not provide clear evidence about possible surface deterioration due to biodegradation or utilization of the plastic lucas et al 2008 suggests that the isotopic composition of carbon can provide reliable information regarding microbial degradation of experimental plastics irms isotope ratio mass spectrometry results show a difference between δ 13c values for plant derived bio bag 25 3 0 7 n 13 and petroleum based polymers pet 27 8 1 7 n 7 berto et al 2017 the study by lucas et al 2008 also revealed differences between plastic items composed of the same polymer but from different countries and between some recycled and nano recycled plastics furthermore increased δ 13c were observed after exposure to uv light birch et al 2021 in an earlier study by matjašič et al 2020 the isotopic composition of carbon δ 13c was determined for different materials pet textile pet bottle and hdpe bag the study confirmed the ability of microorganisms from activated sludge to colonize plastics in an environment without other carbon sources the value of δ 13c was slightly increased in all tested materials compared to the source material suggesting a certain level of degradation in this study the value of untreated pet fibers was determined to be 28 9 0 1 and the average value for rinsed samples was 28 6 0 2 ε 0 3 on performing an isotopic analysis we found that while not significant the average values of treated samples were higher than those of untreated fabric the shift in δ 13c could be due to either physical chemical or biological degradation although determination of the degradation rate was not possible biological degradation could occur due to the adhered biofilm as seen in the sem micrographs fig 6 4 conclusion the present study is one of the few studies investigating colonization patterns and seasonal dynamics of biofilm activity in situ riverbed sediments in the presence of pet fibers we found that during colonization and biofilm formation the biofilm biomass measured as tpc and microbial activity measured as etsa were slightly suppressed by the presence of pet while metabolic functioning measured as clpp differed between treatments due to different intensities in their use of 2 hydroxybenzoic acid i e phenolic compound and alfa cyclodextrin i e polymer the presence of pet fibers suppressed biomass and microbial activity over the four seasons and suppressed the seasonal dynamics in microbial functioning in both colonization and seasonal studies utilization of synthetic polymer substrates tween 40 colonization and tween 80 seasonal was significantly higher in sediments polluted with pet fibers little surface deterioration of pet fibers was observed after one year of exposure to in situ conditions in riverbed sediments suggesting pet biodegradation in the hyporheic zone takes a considerably longer time further work should be conducted to understand better how the presence of pet and other plastic micropollutants affects the biogeochemical cycle and self cleaning ability of rivers a function of the hyporheic microbial community to deepen the understanding of metabolic processes wider studies with more rivers of varying

16695,worldwide the production of plastics is increasing and plastic pollution in aquatic environments is a major global concern under natural conditions plastic weathers to smaller pieces called microplastics mp which come in various shapes with fibers often being the most common in freshwater sediments the hyporheic zone an ecotone between surface and groundwater is important for the transport and fate of all mp particles the main metabolic pathways in rivers take place in the hyporheic zone and are driven by a diverse microbial community the objective of this study was to investigate in situ whether the presence of pet fibers in riverbed sediments affects patterns of colonization and the seasonal dynamics of microbial metabolic activities in the hyporheic zone the effects of the presence of pet on microbial metabolism were evaluated in situ over a month colonization study and over a year seasonal study by measuring total protein content tpc and microbial respiration as respiratory electron transport system activity etsa and by community level physiological profiling clpp additionally pet fibers were examined under a scanning electron microscope sem and isotopic analysis δ 13c of pet was performed after one year of exposure to field conditions the findings demonstrated that during colonization and biofilm formation and also over the seasons the date had a large and significant impact on biofilm growth and activity while pet presence slightly suppressed microbial biomass tpc and respiratory activity etsa overall microbial activity was repressed in the presence of pet fibers but there was a higher capacity for the utilization of complex synthetic polymer substrates i e tween 40 which have previously been linked to polluted environments sem micrographs showed diverse microbial communities adhering to pet fibers but little surface deterioration similarly isotopic analysis suggested little deterioration of pet fibers after one year of in situ conditions the study indicated that pet fibers present in riverbed sediments could have impacts on the metabolic functioning in rivers and thus affect their self cleaning ability

environmental concern worldwide the production of plastics had increased from 1 5 million tonnes in 1950 to 360 million tonnes in 2018 plasticseurope 2019 due to their durability and the low recycling rate plastics have now been accumulating in landfills and the natural environment for almost a century under natural conditions plastic waste weathers to smaller pieces called microplastics particles 5 mm mp which thus more easily enter food webs and serve as vectors for toxic chemical compounds thompson et al 2004 or pathogens wu et al 2019 in concordance with global production rates high and low density polyethylene hd ld pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc are the most common polymers found in the environment wagner et al 2014 in freshwater sediments the main types of mp according to a review by yang et al 2021 are pe pp and ps but pet is also frequently found in river and lake sediments across the globe various shapes of microplastics including fragments foams fibers and films have been detected in freshwater sediments but the fibers probably closely connected to the washing of textiles are those most commonly occurring in freshwater sediments yang et al 2021 in waste waters which are among the most significant sources of freshwater pollution the most frequently found mps are pet fibers and irregularly shaped pe particles ziajahromi et al 2017 the major sources of mp particles in freshwater are secondary mp generated by the breakdown of larger items such as single use packaging tires and fibers these enter freshwaters due to poor waste management through surface and agricultural runoff or as wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents wong et al 2020 matjašič et al 2021 despite the fact that wwtps are highly efficient in retaining mp with 78 98 of mp removed in the primary treatment due to the high volume of treated effluents released to recipient water bodies every day the mp contamination received into aquatic ecosystems is still considerable prata 2018 wong et al 2020 the main metabolic pathways in rivers take place within the riverbeds in the so called hyporheic zone orghidan 2010 here surface water organic matter particles organisms and pollutants enter the subsurface sediments mix with the groundwater and are in close contact with the biofilms that overgrow sediment particles boulton et al 1998 hancock et al 2005 in the hyporheic zone biofilms generally include heterotrophs and chemolithotrophs embedded in a polysaccharide matrix battin et al 2016 freshwater sediments are considered sinks for mp for example a study by scherer et al 2020 found that the concentration of mp in sediments is higher than that in water columns for both rivers and lakes moreover frei et al 2019 demonstrated that riverbed sediments of up to 0 6 m i e the hyporheic zone can be an accumulation area for mp of smaller size 50 μm and pointed out that hyporheic exchange is a potential mechanism for smaller mp particles to enter an underlying aquifer and thus contaminate the groundwater similarly a field stream study by drummond et al 2020 indicates that in streambed sediments hyporheic exchange is important for the transport and fate i e deposition retention and long term accumulation of all mp particles 100 μm irrespective of polymer type several studies have indicated that pollution with mp affects aquatic biofilms miao et al 2021 demonstrated substrate specific functional diversity for biofilms growing on pet or pvc substrates taken from three rivers they used ecoplates biolog usa as detectors for the metabolic functioning of microbial communities and observed the differences in metabolic profiles between biofilms growing on either pet or pvc substrates in all three rivers by measuring the intensity of utilization of 31 substrates from the ecoplates an interesting laboratory study by seeley et al 2020 clearly indicates that the amendment of sediments with either pe pvc puf or pla microplastics alters the composition of the sediment microbial community and the nitrogen cycling processes li et al 2020 found a decrease in the α diversity of microorganisms from river sediments under the impacts of mp and significant effects on the structure and functioning of the microbial community it is well known that loss of bacterial species richness can have a strongly negative impact on ecosystem functioning and services delgado baquerizo et al 2016 for example for heterotrophic bacteria to degrade complex compounds the bacteria need to create a syntrophic metabolic chain this means that one bacteria uses the products of catabolism from another as a source of carbon santisi et al 2015 losses in microbial diversity may result in the disruption of these metabolic chains because for some species resources become available only if another species degrades and consumes a part of that resource delgado baquerizo et al 2016 further studies are needed to fully understand how loss and changes in microbial structural and functional diversity due to the presence of plastic pollution impact the ecosystem processes in riverbed sediments after disturbances such as drought or high water levels the colonization and re colonization of natural sediments or anthropogenic debris by biofilm takes place within a few days and the rate increases with warmer temperatures villanueva et al 2011 hoellein et al 2014 the development of freshwater biofilms and their composition and functional diversity also depends on hydrological shear stress rickard et al 2004 hyporheic exchange rates simčič and mori 2007 substrate surface and type of substrate wang et al 2020 available nutrients in the surrounding water griebler et al 2002 and pollution with mp li et al 2020 niu et al 2021 the complex microbial communities i e biofilms living here are the driving force behind the ecosystem processes and biogeochemical cycles arias real et al 2020 and are therefore an essential element of the self purification capacity of rivers fischer et al 2005 battin et al 2016 harrison et al 2018 alterations in microbial communities can affect carbon cycling arias andres et al 2019 to obtain information on the structure of the biofilms related to plastic or mp pollution studies of environmental genetic material metagenomics are increasingly popular but they are expensive and require extensive knowledge of bioinformatics alternatively quick and simple methods such as community level physiological profiling clpp can broaden the understanding of in situ ecological and ecosystem functions as based on community metabolic activity and thus provide a quick way to assess the ecological health of a freshwater system in addition they can provide simple indicators of the impacts of mp on biofilm functioning weber and legge 2010 the objective of this study was to investigate in situ whether the presence of pet fibers in riverbed sediments affects patterns of colonization and the seasonal dynamics of microbial metabolic activities in the hyporheic zone this can be achieved by using either simple respiratory electron transport system activity etsa or more complex community level physiological profiling clpp measures of microbial functioning the specific aims of this research were 1 to investigate the colonization patterns of natural biofilms in plastic free sediments and to compare them with colonization in pet contaminated natural sediments 2 to observe seasonal dynamics in biofilm functioning in both pet polluted and unpolluted sediments over a one year period and 3 to observe whether pet fibers exposed to natural conditions in the hyporheic zone for a year showed any indications of deterioration or biodegradation new biofilm development is usually driven by extreme events such as flooding or droughts over the different seasons this study provides initial insights into the impacts of pet pollution on hyporheic biofilm metabolic activity and functioning following such events 2 methods 2 1 in situ experimental design the study was carried out in the pre alpine gravel bed river kamniška bistrica a left tributary of the sava river in north central slovenia se europe the study river emerges at a 630 m elevation in the southern kamniško savinjske alps and is 33 km long with a catchment area of 539 km2 in the upper part of the catchment kamniška bistrica is a typical undisturbed pre alpine river while in the lower reaches it is strongly impacted by urbanization intensive agriculture and wastewater treatment effluents a 100 m river stretch between the two settlements beričevo and videm 46 05 18 4 n 14 37 33 1 e 268 m altitude was selected as a study site within the study stretch six sites which included pools p1 3 deeper areas with slower water and runs r1 3 areas with faster water were selected to encompass the spatial heterogeneity of the environmental parameters within the riverbed such as hydraulic conductivity temperature redox conditions and water chemistry table 1 at each site three types of artificial substrates control low pet high pet pre prepared in the laboratory as described below were inserted into the riverbed the substrates were inserted at depths of 20 to 40 cm and then covered with natural sediments on 28th of june 2019 d0 the natural riverbed sediments are composed of cobbles pebbles gravel sand and silt with cobbles and gravel as the dominant particles a temperature logger vemco innovasea usa was inserted together with the artificial substrates the artificial substrates in pockets and bags were inserted perpendicular to the subsurface stream flow during the colonization the first four samplings i e collections of the pre prepared substrates were carried out in weekly to monthly intervals d1 one week d2 two weeks d3 a month d4 two months after that the samplings were carried out seasonally d5 autumn 2019 d6 winter 2019 d7 spring 2020 d8 summer 2020 fig 1 concurrently river water levels surface water temperatures conductivity and oxygen concentrations were measured using field probes multi 3430 wtw germany in addition surface water samples were collected for laboratory analysis of dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen ntot analyzed at the slovenian forestry institute 2 2 artificial substrate preparation sediments for the preparation of the artificial substrates were taken from the same site where the in situ experiment was later to be carried out about 15 kg of sediments were washed and sieved in the laboratory to obtain sediments with particle sizes between 2 and 4 mm and between 1 and 2 mm these two size classes were mixed in a ratio of 2 1 before filling the pockets with them so as to standardize the sediment surface which is one of the most important factors when estimating biofilm activity i e simčič and mori 2007 since the pockets were buried and thus fixed in the riverbed sediments they were not exposed to being continuously washed out by the surface water and the loss of smaller fraction 2 mm in the sediments was minor store bought fabric was used for the colonization study and characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir as polyethylene terephthalate pet as described in matjašič et al 2020 the fabric was washed in a washing machine at 40 c and exposed to sunlight for about a month after exposure the fabric was cut into 120 120 mm pieces for use in the experiment galvanized net 2 2 mm mesh size was cut into bigger i e 350 400 mm for the bags and smaller pieces i e 160 120 and 160 180 mm for the pockets the pieces were folded in half and stapled together with galvanized staples to construct the pockets later to be filled with the artificial substrate or the larger bags to be filled with the pockets placing the pockets into the bags was to prevent the loss of the artificial substrates during the one year study in the event of floods or increased discharge for each sampling site p1 3 r1 3 three bags of size 35 40 cm each containing 13 smaller pockets were prepared these three bags contained the control c the low pet 1p and the high pet 5p pockets separately the control pockets c were filled with 50 g of washed and sieved sediment the low pet pockets 1p were filled with a mixture of the washed and sieved sediment and pet fabric in the ratio 10 versus 0 2 50 g of sediment 1 g pet and the high pet 5p in the ratio 10 versus 0 7 70 g of sediment 5 g pet hence we had an experimental set up with low 1p and high 5p amounts of pet fiber present we used more sediment for the high pet treatment to maintain the conditions at the microscale similar to natural conditions in the hyporheic zone i e a complex network of interstitial pores between sediment grains of different sizes the artificial substrates were then autoclaved twice within a two day window at 121 5 c for 15 min prior to application in the field 2 3 laboratory work on each sampling date one pocket was extracted from each bag c 1p 5p and from each site p 1 3 r 1 3 altogether obtaining 18 pockets in the laboratory the pockets were cut with scissors and the sediments were mixed well with a spoon before analysis part of a sediment 2 g was used immediately for community level physiological profiling clpp while the remaining sediment was frozen at 80 c for later use with other analyzes pom tpc etsa described in sections 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 respectfully all samples were frozen for at least a week prior to analysis once thawed part of the sediment 8

ultrasonic homogenizer 4710 cole parmer vernon il usa for 2 min and then put into a centrifuge 4 min 10 000 rpm at 0 c refrigerated centrifuge sigma 2k15 st louis mo usa to collect the microorganisms from biofilms overgrowing the sediment particles the supernatant containing the microorganisms was further used for tpc and etsa analyzes the rest of the thawed sediment 10 g was used to determine particulate organic matter pom and dry weight of sediments dw dw was used for the calculations of tpc and etsa samples of pet fibers were taken on the last date after one year of in situ exposure d8 summer for isotopic analysis and sem micrographs 2 4 particulate organic matter pom the amount of particulate organic matter pom in the sediments was determined by loss on ignition loi for the pom measurements approximately 10 g of thawed sediment was placed in a ceramic bowl and weighed to obtain wet weight ww next the sediments were incubated at 105 c until constant in weight and then weighed again to obtain dry weight dw the sediments were then put into an oven at 520 c for 2 h to ignite the organic substance when cooled the bowls with sediments were weighed again to obtain loss on ignition pom was expressed as gpom kgdw 1 2 5 total protein content tpc total protein content tpc was used as a proxy for microbial biomass it was measured using pierce bca protein assay kit thermo fisher scientific usa the assay is a spectrophotometric assay based on the alkaline reduction of the cupric to the cuprous ion by the protein followed by chelation and color development by the bicinchoninic acid bca reagent lovrien and matulis 2005 the bca copper complex is water soluble and exhibits a strong linear relationship between absorbance at 562 nm and increasing protein concentrations standards and reagents were prepared in accordance with manufacturers instructions the sample or standard 25 μl was thoroughly mixed with the working reagent 200 μl on the microplate and was then incubated for 30 min at 37 c the microplate was cooled to room temperature and then the absorbance was immediately measured at 562 nm with spectrofluorometer synergymx biotek instruments

estimates overall microbial respiratory activity by detecting the activities of dehydrogenases and cytochromes within the electron transport system that biochemically controls cell respiration debeljak et al 2017 etsa was measured by applying a modified assay adapted from packard 1971 the supernatant obtained from thawed samples exposed to the homogenizer and centrifuged as described above was poured into a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube on ice and later microtiter plates were used for every sample 30 µl was put into each of two adjacent wells while a third well was left empty the blank next 150 µl of substrate solution nadh nadph was carefully added to each well followed by 50 µl of int iodonitrotetrazolium chloride reagent the plate was incubated at 20 c in the dark for 30 min after incubation 50 µl of stopper solution was added to all wells finally 30 μl of the corresponding sample was added to all the blanks the absorbance was measured immediately with a microplate reader

profiling clpp was carried out using the biolog ecoplates assay biolog california usa which provides information on community functioning the assay was developed by garland and mills 1991 for soil samples and includes direct incubation of environmental samples in microtiter plates containing 31 different carbon sources nutrients and a redox dye the assay enables fast characterization of microbial community metabolism by spectrophotometric measurement of the intensity of pre prepared substrate utilization which includes carbohydrates polymers carboxylic and ketonic acids phenolic compounds amino acids and amines amides table 2 among the polymer substrates on the plate are also synthetic polymers such as tween 40 and tween 80 increased utilization of these was previously shown to be typical for polluted environments e g sala 2006 thus making them suitable indicators of pollution after each sampling 2 g of fresh sediment collected from the pockets exposed to different treatments c 1p 5p and from the six sites p1 3 r1 3 n 18 was put into a marked sterilized glass beaker 100 ml on an electro balance sartorius bp 210 s germany and 20 ml of chilled ringer solution ringer solution ¼ strength tablets sigma aldrich 1 tablet in 500 ml deionized water was added the beakers were transferred to an ultrasonic bath elmasonic p elma singen germany for 1 min 37 khz 30 each beaker was gently shaken while the solution was poured into two tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 rpm at 4 c next 150 μl of supernatant was transferred using multichannel pipettes to ecoplates and the absorbance of each well was measured using a spectrofluorometer synergymx biotek instruments usa at 590 nm on the same day and again after 24 48 and 72 h between the measurements the plates were incubated in the dark at 20 c the ecoplate consists of 96 wells divided into three groups each containing one blank well and 31 different carbon sources table 2 meaning the experiment is conducted in triplicate on one plate raw absorbance values measured for the substrate wells on each plate were corrected by the mean absorbance of the control wells the three wells with no substrate for clpp the substrate utilization metric measured after 72 h was used because most absorbance readings were below 2 according to weber and legge 2010 absorbance values taken later during the incubation can provide more information but the values must not exceed 2 as higher values contribute to measurement error 2 8 isotopic analysis the untreated reference pet fibers were compared to the pet fibers exposed to in situ conditions for a year the pet fibers from the field were rinsed with deionized water to remove the majority of the organic matter including the biofilm so as not to interfere with the results about 0 5 mg of material was weighed in tin capsules the isotopic composition of carbon δ 13c was determined using a europa 20 20 continuous flow irms anca sl preparation module the determination of isotopic composition followed combustion of the capsules in a hot furnace at 1000 c the products generated were reduced in a cu tube 600 c where excess o2 was absorbed h2o

method was used to determine the significance of the factors and interactions all data were transformed using log10 x 1 in order to achieve the anova assumptions and were analyzed separately for colonization and seasonal difference all significance was p 0 05 unless specified otherwise the clpp absorbance data were transformed using log10 x 1 and investigated using multivariate non metric multidimensional scaling nmds separately for colonization and the seasonal study bray curtis dissimilarity was used to calculate distance and visualize distribution patterns the input data for the nmds included the data on absorbance from all three treatments c 1p 5p separately for colonization and the seasonal study however due to the better visibility of variability between samples in metabolic functioning the control low and high pet treatments are presented in three separate ordination diagrams for the colonization fig 4a and seasonal study fig 4b respectively to test for significant differences between the dates and the differences between treatments analysis of similarity anosim was conducted to search for the substrate utilization that contributed the most to the differences between groups i e dates for individual treatments similarity percentage analysis simper was used heatmaps were constructed to demonstrate the intensity of individual substrate utilization under different treatments and dates heatmaps are graphical representations of data where the intensity of substrate utilization is depicted by color a two way anova treatment date and tukey s hsd post hoc were performed on data for individual substrate utilization and groups of substrates e g polymers carbohydrates etc table 2 the same transformed data as for the clpp analysis were used the analyzes were carried out using r studio software r core team 2019 using packages such as tidyverse wickham et al 2019 vegan jari oksanen et al 2020 and heatmaply galili et al 2017 simper was performed using past 3 22 hammer et al 2001 3 results and discussion 3 1 colonization patterns of river biofilms under different treatments presence or absence of pet fibers the biofilm presence on artificial substrates i e treated 1p 5p and untreated control c sediments measured as total protein content tpc and microbial respiratory electron transport system activity etsa over the first two weeks and until two months d1 d4 could already be detected after one week d1 of exposure to natural conditions figs 2 a and 3 a hinting that microbial colonization is fast in riverbed sediments no significant differences were observed between treatments c 1p 5p while the date d1 d4 was a statistically significant factor tpc two way anova f 48 381 p 0 001 etsa two way anova f 41 915 p 0 001 differences were significant between all date combinations for both tpc and etsa except for the last two dates d3 d4 tukey s post hoc test however despite the insignificant differences between treatments generally lower mean tpc and etsa were observed on the sediments impacted by both low 1p and high amounts 5p of pet fibers on all sampling dates figs 2a and 3a the lower total protein content tpc and respiratory electron transport system activity etsa observed on all dates in the presence of pet fibers indicated that pet possibly suppresses both the process of biofilm colonization and the development of mature biofilms a measurement of respiratory electron transport system activity etsa is an ecological factor that is well studied in aquatic ecosystems it is relatively simple to measure and is sensitive to ecosystem stress simčič et al 2015 it has been used to highlight the importance of stressors such as temperature and increased nutrient loads on microbial respiration in the hyporheic zone debeljak et al 2017 mori et al 2018 and it would seem that it also responds to stress due to pet pollution during the presence of plastic pollution substances can be released that have toxic effects on microorganisms enabling only a few adapted bacteria to grow in their presence li et al 2020 or such substances can have a general inhibitory effect on the respiratory activity of microorganisms since antimicrobial additives are often used in the production of polyester pet fibers al balakocy and shalaby 2017 this may have influenced the microbial community in this study the comparison of microbial community functioning i e clpp between different treatments c 1p 5p during colonization d1 d4 using nmds fig 4 a stress 0 1159 indicated that the presence of pet suppressed shifts in microbial community functioning during colonization the differences between samples from different dates were smaller under the presence of pet in comparison to the controls especially in the case of high pet presence however the analysis of similarity anosim which tested for significant differences in microbial functioning between dates and treatments revealed the importance of the dates d1 d4 r 0 3905 p 0 05 but not of the treatments r 0 0203 p 0 102 for the variability in microbial functioning still differences between dates for the individual treatments were bigger for the control anosim r 0 7233 p 0 001 relative to the treatments anosim 1p r 0 5579 p 0 001 and 5p r 0 2523 p 0 001 suggesting the suppression of functional shifts in microbial communities during colonization in the presence of pet fibers the simper analysis indicated that the substrates that contributed the most to the differences between the sample date were similar in the control and treatment 1p and included itaconic acid gamma hydroxybutyric acid and l phenylalanine while under treatment 5p the utilization of l phenylalanine 2 hydroxybenzoic acid and alfa cyclodextrin contributed the most to the variability between the sample date the former two substrates utilization was substantially lower in treatment 5p the utilization of l phenylalanine was slightly higher under treatment 5p while the last two substrates were substantially more intensively utilized under treatment 5p appendix a itaconic acid is an ingredient known in medicine as salicylic acid ncbi 2021a phenylalanine is an essential aromatic amino acid for humans and is important in the structure and function of many proteins and enzymes its l form is incorporated into proteins ncbi 2021b alfa cyclodextrin is one of the most common natural cyclodextrins gidwani and vyas 2015 with high water solubility the ability to form complexes and relatively resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis its potential applications are increasing especially in the food industry li et al 2014 the community composition and functioning of stream biofilms are driven by an array of environmental factors that are usually highly interconnected in response to the physical and chemical structure of the streambed environment with its variability biofilms adapt and evolve which may lead to changes in biofilm carbon metabolism battin et al 2016 but only to a certain extent certain previous studies suggest that plastics have an inhibitory effect on stream biofilms miao et al 2019 compared natural and mp pe and pp substrates in terms of community structure and microbial function their results suggest that although mp serves as a new substrate for microbial colonization it decreases the richness and diversity of biofilms compared to those inhabiting natural substrates mp probably alters microbial survival strategies and negatively affects their ecological functions and other biogeochemical processes further miao et al 2021 show that biofilms on pet have lower capacities and carbon metabolism rates and the lowest diversity compared to those on glass or pvc li et al 2020 demonstrated that mp reduced the α diversity of microorganisms and had a significant effect on the structure of microbial communities additionally li et al 2020 demonstrated differences in microbial diversity community structure and functioning when comparing sediments with low or high amounts of mp seeley et al 2020 assessed bacterial community diversity based on miseq sequencing of 16s rrna genes communities exposed to pe and puf expressed the most variation over time as opposed to the control and pla communities which exhibited minimal changes over time a study by niu et al 2021 showed a significant difference between bacterial communities from mps sieved from river sediments and sediments using absorbance readings from ecoplates a comparison of the individual substrate utilization during colonization and between treatments and dates was visualized using heatmaps fig 5 a under pet stress some substrates were poorly utilized in comparison to the control one such case was carbohydrate d xylose indicating that pet presence could suppress the capacity of the microbial community for the degradation of allochthonous wood or plant debris containing xylose in contrast other substrates such as tween 40 tween 80 and alpha cyclodextrin were utilized more intensely under pet stress utilization of the substrates pyruvic acid methly ester d glucosaminic acid and glycyl l glutamic acid changed significantly over the dates and the interaction between date and treatment was significant two way anova the intensity of utilization of substrate d xylose gamma hydroxybutyric acid itaconic acid l arginine l asparagine and l serine changed significantly with date and treatment and when in interaction while utilization of tween 40 significantly depended on the type of treatment and was more intense in the presence of higher concentrations of pet tukey s post hoc p 0 001 the polymers included in ecoplates tween 40 c1 tween 80 d1 alfa cyclodextrin e1 and glycogen f1 are complex carbon substrates utilization of complex polymers tween 40 has previously been linked to polluted environments sala et al 2006 oest et al 2018 generally significant differences between treatments were observed for carbohydrates two way anova f 3 602 p 0 05 and carboxylic and ketonic acids two way anova f 5 132 p 0 01 while carbohydrates and the other four substrate groups polymers phenolic compounds amino acids amines amides showed significant differences between dates table 3 in addition for carboxylic and ketonic acids date two way anova f 27 975 p 0 001 and interaction between date and treatment two way anova f 12 756 p 0 001 proved significant the most significant difference in the degradation of carboxylic and ketonic acids was between the control and treatment 5p p 0 01 a large quantity of organic matter and nutrients is delivered to the hyporheic zone by river surface water penetrating the streambed where it becomes trapped and is further decomposed by microbial communities krause et al 2011 zhou et al 2014 in general a high consumption of carbohydrates and carboxylic acids in freshwater sediments has been reported by multiple studies oest et al 2018 melita et al 2019 miao et al 2019 carbohydrates and carboxylic and ketonic acids are important carbon sources for aquatic microorganisms sala et al 2006 arnosti et al 2014 studies consistently report that the presence of plastic lowers the biodiversity of microbial communities miao et al 2019 li et al 2020 seeley et al 2020 miao et al 2021 and this was also indicated in our colonization study 3 2 seasonal dynamics of biofilms under different treatments the presence or absence of pet fibers river systems are highly dynamic environments driven by climate and hydrogeological characteristics and impacted by an array of anthropogenic pressures the river studied has a strong seasonal pattern for discharge rates and water temperatures fig 1 this is also reflected in the water physico chemistry table 1 and consequently also in the biofilm structure and function figs 2b and 3b the highest mean value for tpc was in the autumn and then it gradually decreased exhibiting the lowest values but highest spatial variability in the summer microbial activity measured as etsa was highest in the summer when the variability within the streambed was also the highest for both the tpc and etsa the season was a significant factor tpc two way anova f 31 886 p 0 001 etsa two way anova f 5 178 p 0 01 while both etsa p 0 01 and tpc p 0 001 were significantly different between summer and winter or spring the tpc in summer was also significantly different from that in autumn while there were also significant differences between autumn and spring and between spring and winter the key driver of microbial activity in riverbed sediments is temperature but nutrients and organic carbon are also important for the general functional response of the hyporheic biofilm debeljak et al 2017 mori et al 2018 seasonal changes in temperature discharge and water chemistry were most probably driving the seasonal patterns observed in tpc and etsa in the control sediments in this study the differences in tpc and etsa between the control sediments and the sediments under pet pollution were insignificant but generally lower means for tpc and etsa were observed in the sediments impacted by the pet fibers 1p 5p during all four seasons suggesting as in the colonization study that the presence of pet fibers suppresses the biofilm biomass and respiratory potential throughout the year the least in autumn and the most in summer using clpp for a comparison of microbial functioning between seasons and treatments also revealed that the presence of pet suppressed the seasonal dynamics nmds ordination plots fig 4b stress 0 1944 indicate differences in microbial functioning between the control and treatments 1p and 5p however the microbial utilization of substrates differed significantly between seasons anosim r 0 4214 p 0 001 but not between treatments anosim r 0 0181 p 0 1697 these findings suggest that biofilms growing in the presence of a large quantity of pet fibers are less susceptible to seasonal changes than those in a control treatment the three substrates that contributed the most to the differences between date samples in the control were d xylose l phenylalanine and itaconic acid while in the samples under the pet fiber treatments 1p and 5p alfa cyclodextrin was the most intensively used substrate rather than itaconic acid in addition alfa cyclodextrin was among those substrates contributing most to the differences between the control and the treatments both 1p and 5p appendix a table 1 and thus one of the four polymers contributing the most to the differences between seasons this contribution was highest in the presence of the larger quantity of pet fibers 8 9 versus 4 2 c and 7 6 1p additionally glucose 1 phosphate was present in the simper results for the first 50 of the substrates thus contributing to differences between the samples for both treatments 1p 5p but not for the control this last substrate is a component in glycogen metabolism explaining the lower contribution of glycogen in both instances 1 9 1p and 1 4 5p versus 2 4 in the control as this was probably used as a carbon source and suggests a shift in the metabolic profile of the microbial community glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose acting as its readily mobilized storage form for numerous organisms berg et al 2002 investigation of the heatmaps presenting substrate utilization using ecoplates absorbance readings fig 5b indicated either more intensive utilization of carbon sources dark green or none at all dark red in the treatment with the higher quantity of pet this could be an indication that the community is shifting toward more specialized metabolism and therefore exhibits lower adaptability to newly available substrates melita et al 2019 when observing the separate utilization of substrates during the seasonal study l arginine l asparagine and phenylethyl amine were significantly dependent on the type of treatment and were utilized more intensely in the presence of the higher amount of pet fibers tukey s post hoc p 0 05 utilization of substrates d cellobiose i erythritol d galacturonic acid gamma hydroxybutyric acids glycyl l glutamic acids tween 80 and alfa cyclodextrin were all affected by both date and treatment both polymers tween 80 tukey post hoc p 0 05 and alfa cyclodextrin tukey s post hoc p 0 01 were utilized more intensely in the presence of higher amounts of pet fibers significant differences between treatments were observed for the polymer group two way anova f 3 642 p 0 05 between the control and the highest presence of pet fibers tukey s post hoc p 0 05 additionally the amines amides group showed significant differences between dates and treatments carbohydrates and amino acids showed significant difference between seasons while the other two carboxylic and ketonic acids and phenolic compound showed no significance whatsoever table 3 after a year of exposure to pet fibers bacterial communities had started to utilize the synthetic polymer tween 80 this indicates a shift in metabolic functioning and suggests that the community could adapt to utilizing synthetic polymers the significance of the amines amides group could indicate low nitrogen conditions and the presence of opportunistic classes of bacteria oest et al 2018 seeley et al 2020 3 3 observed changes in pet fibers and δ13c after one year of in situ exposure the surface of untreated reference pet fibers is smooth with occasional small bumps or irregularities presumably arising during manufacture without visible surface overgrowth or deterioration fig 6 despite washing with deionized water diverse microorganisms probably fungal hyphae and bacilli were observed on the pet fibers exposed to in situ conditions for one year this confirms that microorganisms in hyporheic sediments overgrow not only sediments but also pet fibers while the sem micrographs indisputably indicate a diverse biofilm they do not provide clear evidence about possible surface deterioration due to biodegradation or utilization of the plastic lucas et al 2008 suggests that the isotopic composition of carbon can provide reliable information regarding microbial degradation of experimental plastics irms isotope ratio mass spectrometry results show a difference between δ 13c values for plant derived bio bag 25 3 0 7 n 13 and petroleum based polymers pet 27 8 1 7 n 7 berto et al 2017 the study by lucas et al 2008 also revealed differences between plastic items composed of the same polymer but from different countries and between some recycled and nano recycled plastics furthermore increased δ 13c were observed after exposure to uv light birch et al 2021 in an earlier study by matjašič et al 2020 the isotopic composition of carbon δ 13c was determined for different materials pet textile pet bottle and hdpe bag the study confirmed the ability of microorganisms from activated sludge to colonize plastics in an environment without other carbon sources the value of δ 13c was slightly increased in all tested materials compared to the source material suggesting a certain level of degradation in this study the value of untreated pet fibers was determined to be 28 9 0 1 and the average value for rinsed samples was 28 6 0 2 ε 0 3 on performing an isotopic analysis we found that while not significant the average values of treated samples were higher than those of untreated fabric the shift in δ 13c could be due to either physical chemical or biological degradation although determination of the degradation rate was not possible biological degradation could occur due to the adhered biofilm as seen in the sem micrographs fig 6 4 conclusion the present study is one of the few studies investigating colonization patterns and seasonal dynamics of biofilm activity in situ riverbed sediments in the presence of pet fibers we found that during colonization and biofilm formation the biofilm biomass measured as tpc and microbial activity measured as etsa were slightly suppressed by the presence of pet while metabolic functioning measured as clpp differed between treatments due to different intensities in their use of 2 hydroxybenzoic acid i e phenolic compound and alfa cyclodextrin i e polymer the presence of pet fibers suppressed biomass and microbial activity over the four seasons and suppressed the seasonal dynamics in microbial functioning in both colonization and seasonal studies utilization of synthetic polymer substrates tween 40 colonization and tween 80 seasonal was significantly higher in sediments polluted with pet fibers little surface deterioration of pet fibers was observed after one year of exposure to in situ conditions in riverbed sediments suggesting pet biodegradation in the hyporheic zone takes a considerably longer time further work should be conducted to understand better how the presence of pet and other plastic micropollutants affects the biogeochemical cycle and self cleaning ability of rivers a function of the hyporheic microbial community to deepen the understanding of metabolic processes wider studies with more rivers of varying

16696,despite the widespread occurrence of furan moieties in synthetic and natural compounds their fate in aqueous ozonation has not been investigated in detail reaction rate constants of seven commonly used furans with ozone were measured and ranged from ko3 8 5 104 to 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 depending on the type and position of furan ring substituents transformation product analysis of the reaction of furans with ozone focusing on the formation of toxic organic electrophiles using a novel amino acid reactivity assay revealed the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds 2 butene 1 4 dial bda and its substituted analogues bda rs their formation can be attributed to ozone attack at the reactive α c position leading to furan ring opening the molar yields of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds varied with the applied ozone concentration reaching maximum values of 7 for 2 furoic acid the identified α β unsaturated dicarbonyls are well known toxicophores that are also formed by enzymatic oxidation of furans in the human body in addition to providing data on kinetics transformation product analysis and proposed reaction mechanisms for the ozonation of furans this study raises concern about the presence of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds in water treatment and the resulting effects on human and environmental health graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic micropollutants transformation products reactivity directed analysis dicarbonyls toxic by products 1 introduction furans are heterocyclic aromatics comprising a five membered ring of four carbons and one oxygen atom the use of furan derivatives for the production of biomass derived fuels polymers and other chemicals has dramatically increased over the last decades eldeeb and akih kumgeh 2018 gandini et al 2016 keay and dibble 1996 tong et al 2010 furfural a commodity chemical and precursor of many other furans has a global production capacity of 280 kton per year with 65 used to produce furfuryl alcohol mariscal et al 2016 in addition to their industrial applications furans are common moieties in a variety of naturally occurring compounds including terpenes and fatty acids and can be formed abiotically from the oxidation of natural organic matter hannemann et al 1989 huber et al 2010 wang et al 2014 the extensive use of furan containing chemicals and their natural occurrence make them likely contaminants in wastewater and drinking water resources as evidenced by the detection of furan containing compounds particularly pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluent and surface water jelic et al 2011 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 kostich et al 2014 ozonation is increasingly used for the removal of trace organic contaminants in wastewater treatment wastewater reuse and drinking water production gottschalk et al 2009 ozone is a selective oxidant that primarily reacts with electron rich moieties such as double bonds von gunten 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 transformation products of the ozonation of organic compounds include carbonyls formed by cleavage of olefinic bonds or benzene rings n oxides and hydroxylamines by oxidation of amines and sulfoxides by oxidation of thioethers hübner et al 2015 lee and von gunten 2016 the identification of ozone transformation products with eco toxicological implications is of importance von gunten 2018 for example the main ozonation product of carboxy acyclovir inhibits the growth of green algae an effect not observed for the parent compound schlüter vorberg et al 2015 similarly embryotoxicity in a zebrafish assay was observed for the ozonation products of carbamazepine while no effects were observed for carbamazepine itself pohl et al 2020 despite extensive research on the reaction of ozone with several classes of organic compounds including olefins phenols and nitrogen containing compounds zoumpouli et al 2020 studies focussing on the transformation of furans during aqueous ozonation are limited the dimethylfuran moiety present in the antacid drug ranitidine has been shown to contribute to the high reactivity of this compound with ozone jeon et al 2016 however no transformation products that are specific for the reaction of ozone with the furan moiety were reported christophoridis et al 2016 zou et al 2018 for the diuretic drug furosemide two ozonation products were identified indicating the potential relevance of cleavage and or opening of the furan ring by ozone aalizadeh et al 2019 studies investigating the reaction of furans with ozone in organic solvents or organic solvent water mixtures suggest the potential involvement of different reaction mechanisms bailey and colomb 1957 bailey et al 1965 jibben and wibaut 1960 white et al 1965 jibben and wibaut 1960 identified glyoxal a c2 dicarbonyl as the sole ozone transformation product of furan and attributed its formation to the reaction of ozone with the two carbon carbon double bonds α β bonds of the furan ring leading to a c2 dicarbonyl containing both β c atoms and or to β β addition of ozone leading to two c2 dicarbonyls that contain one α and one β c atom of the furan ring see table 1 for nomenclature in contrast bailey and colomb 1957 and bailey et al 1965 observed the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds containing all four carbons of the furan ring in experiments with diarylfurans such as 2 5 diphenylfuran the results of bailey et al indicate the relevance of two distinct reaction pathways i ozonolysis of a carbon carbon double bond α β bond and ii electrophilic ozone attack at the reactive α c position in either a bidentate or monodentate manner followed by ring cleavage to form a c4 dicarbonyl bailey 1982 these c4 dicarbonyls then form lower molecular weight transformation products through further reaction with ozone bailey 1982 given the absence of kinetic and mechanistic information on the ozonation of furans in aqueous solutions the aim of this study was to determine the ozonation kinetics of various commonly used furans and elucidate the formation of ozonation products in water the specific focus was on the formation of toxic α β unsaturated dicarbonyl transformation products which have been recently identified as novel highly toxic by products formed during the oxidation of phenols with various oxidants including hydroxyl radicals and chlorine prasse et al 2018 prasse et al 2020 in addition α β unsaturated dicarbonyls are also formed during the enzymatic oxidation of furans in the human body catalyzed by cytochrome p450 and are responsible for their toxicity chen et al 1995 peterson 2013 ravindranath et al 1984 the studied furans included two high usage pharmaceuticals furosemide ranitidine that can be frequently found in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants kostich et al 2014 and seven high production volume industrial chemicals furfuryl alcohol 2 furoic acid 2 5 dimethylfuran 2 methyl 3

chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms in addition an amino acid reactivity assay was used to specifically assess the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyls that cannot be directly

18 mω cm 1 produced with a milli q merck or elga veolia water purification system 2 2 ozonation experiments competition kinetics experiments were performed to determine the second order rate constants for the reaction of furans with ozone in pure water buffered at ph 7 10 mm phosphate buffer 10 mm tert butanol ran was used as the reference compound due to its known reaction rate constant with ozone jeon et al 2016 and since initial tests had shown that most of the target furans had an ozone reactivity within approximately one order of magnitude of ran for compounds that reacted with ozone with much lower reaction rate constants than ran fa was used as the reference compound after determining its rate constant using ran further details on competition kinetics experiments and calculations are provided in the si supplementary text s1 batch ozonation experiments to study the formation of transformation products of furans were performed in 20 ml amber glass vials the reaction solutions 10 ml contained 15 μm of the target compound and 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 diluted with ultrapure water after sampling the initial solution a volume of concentrated ozone stock solution see si supplementary text s1 was added to achieve concentrations of 4 to 65 μm ozone 0 3 to 4 3 μm o3 μm target compound the samples were left uncapped at room temperature for approximately 2 hours to achieve residual ozone depletion to assess the influence of oh radical scavenging a subset of experiments figures s2 and s3 in the si was also performed with addition of 10 mm tert butanol koh tert butanol 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 detection of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds was accomplished using an amino acid reactivity assay which is described in detail elsewhere prasse 2021 prasse et al 2018 prasse et al 2020 the reaction of nal with α β unsaturated dicarbonyls leads to the formation of nal adducts which can be detected using lc hrms see section 2 3 prasse et al 2018 to this end a small volume of a nal stock solution was added to the samples final concentration 150 μm equivalent to 10 times the initial concentration of the parent compound followed by incubation at room temperature for 24 hours selected experiments were repeated with higher concentration of the target compound up to 100 μμ to facilitate the identification of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl transformation products additionally for some samples an equimolar mixture of nal and nac stock solutions was used instead of the nal stock solution to enable the detection of dicarbonyls that do not form adducts with nal alone but do form nac or nal nac adducts prasse et al 2018 all samples were analyzed within 48 hours 2 3 analytical approaches spectrophotometric measurements to determine ozone

provided in the si supplementary text s2 2 butene 1 4 dial bda the α β unsaturated dicarbonyl identified in this work was quantified with standard addition calibration curves based on lc hrms analysis of its nal adduct similar to a method described previously prasse et al 2018 stock solutions of bda 1 mm were prepared through hydrolysis of 2 5 dihydro 2 5 dimethoxyfuran in ultrapure water at room temperature for at least 24 hours for each experiment standard addition was applied on one of the samples and the slope of the curve was used for the other samples of that experiment the limit of detection of bda in ultrapure water buffered at ph 7 was 1 nm lowest standard with a signal to noise ratio 3 and the limit of quantification was 10 nm lowest standard with signal to noise ratio 10 ozonation yields of bda were calculated by dividing the molar concentration of bda with the molar concentration of the parent compound that reacted difference between initial and final concentrations yields of other bda analogues bda rs without a standard available were estimated using bda as reference standard 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of the reaction of substituted furans with ozone table 1 shows the second order rate constants for the reaction of nine furans with ozone ko3 in water at ph 7 including two values that were available in the literature the competition kinetics plots for seven of the furans are provided in figure s1 initial tests indicated that the studied furans have a high ozone reactivity which was expected based on the aromaticity of the furan ring competition kinetics experiments showed that the ko3 of fpa mfa frs ffa and bhf varies only by a factor of 2 1 7 0 2 to 3 2 0 2 106 m 1 s 1 while reaction rates for fa and fdca were lower 5 9 0 5 105 and 8 5 0 7 104 m 1 s 1 respectively the ozone reactivity of most tested furans is comparable to that of phenols and anilines at ph 7 lee and von gunten 2012 our results suggest that steric effects due to the presence of substituents do not play an important role which is in agreement with results obtained by bailey et al 1965 for the ozonation of diarylfurans therefore the observed differences of reaction kinetics are most likely attributable to the type of substituents e g electron withdrawing versus electron donating and their positions e g located at an α carbon versus at a β carbon on the furan ring electron donating substituents such as hydroxyl and methyl groups increase the electron density of the furan ring and are therefore expected to enhance its ozone reactivity while electron withdrawing groups such as carboxyl groups have the opposite impact similar to effects observed for phenols lee and von gunten 2012 the three acids fpa mfa and fa have pka values ranging from 3 to 4 4 arena et al 1993 hence they are all dissociated at ph 7 in contrast to the carboxyl group the carboxylate anion exerts an electro donating effect hansch et al 1991 the higher reaction rate constant of mfa compared to fa can likely be explained by the presence of an additional alkyl group and or the presence of a carboxylate substituent at a β rather than an α carbon in fpa the carboxylate group is separated from the furan ring by two additional carbons c2h4 group compared to fa leading to a 5 fold increase of the rate constant comparison of the kinetics of fdca and fa indicates that the presence of an additional carboxylate group 2 5 substitution of fdca versus 2 substitution of fa lowers the ozone reactivity by approximately one order of magnitude the relatively low rate constant of dmf with ozone that has been reported in the literature table 1 further indicates slower reaction kinetics for furans containing substituents at both α carbons 2 5 substitution in contrast bhf 3 4 substitution had the same rate constant as ffa 2 substitution indicating that substituents located at β carbons have a lower impact on the reaction rates further experiments with a more diverse group of furan compounds are necessary to develop quantitative structure activity relationships qsars for substituted furans in oxidative water treatment processes similar to those that have been developed for other compound classes such as phenols and amines lee et al 2015 lee and von gunten 2012 ran contains multiple sites contributing to its high ozone reactivity the furan ring a tertiary amine a thioether and an acetamidine which is the most reactive moiety jeon et al 2016 similarly the high rate constant of frs can be attributed to both a furan ring and an aniline moiety based on qsar calculations the ko3 of frs has been reported as 6 8 104 m 1 s 1 which was the sum of the contributions of the secondary amine pka 3 8 ko3 6 2 104 m 1 s 1 and the benzene ring partly deactivated ko3 6 5 103 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2014 this predicted ko3 of frs is similar to the experimentally determined reactivity of compounds with a p sulfonylaniline moiety dodd et al 2006 the qsar model however did not consider the reactivity of the furan ring which explains why the ko3 determined experimentally for frs in this study ko3 2 2 106 m 1 s 1 is significantly higher than the value predicted by qsar 3 2 transformation of furans by ozone in water in addition to determining the ozonation kinetics of furans the formation of transformation products was investigated of particular interest was the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds due to their potential toxicity and their recent identification in oxidative water treatment processes prasse et al 2018 prasse et al 2020 ozonation products were detected either directly with lc hrms or after derivatization with either nal or a mixture of nal and nac so called reactivity directed analysis rda assays prasse 2021 oh radicals were not scavenged in these experiments in order to represent real ozonation conditions where both ozone and oh radicals are present 3 2 1 transformation of furan containing pharmaceuticals for frs seven ozonation products were detected table s3 and figure s11 the lc hrms results exact mass ms2 spectra indicate that the benzene ring including the chlorine sulfonamide and carboxyl moieties remained unmodified in all ozonation products which is in agreement with the deactivating effect of these three benzene substituents as such oxidation of frs can be attributed to the reaction of ozone with the furfurylamine group with frs 278 being the only detected compound that has been previously reported for the reaction with ozone aalizadeh et al 2019 based on the obtained results the reaction of ozone with the α carbon of the furan moiety is indicated to result in the opening of the furan ring see section 3 3 for more details leading to the formation of an α β unsaturated dicarbonyl transformation product frs 347 which has been observed previously in oxidation of frs in microsomes williams et al 2007 the presence of an α β unsaturated dicarbonyl group is supported by the presence of fragment m z 262 9885 c8h8o4n2cls in the ms2 spectrum of frs 347 which indicates the cleavage of a c4h4o2 moiety formation of frs 328 which has been identified in the oxidation of frs by dimethyldioxirane can most likely be attributed to the intramolecular reaction between the ketoenal group and the amine moiety of frs 347 chen and burka 2007 the formation of a ring condensation product is supported by the absence of ms2 fragments that indicate cleavage of carbon containing moieties furthermore the observed ms2 spectrum is very similar to the results obtained by laurence et al 2014 who used a reference standard for the confirmation of the chemical structure of this compound frs 328 is also formed as a product of anodic and electro fenton oxidation of frs laurencé et al 2011 laurence et al 2014 and has been identified as a human metabolite of frs with evidence that it is a physio pathologically relevant neurodegeneration inducer laurence et al 2019 lc hrms results obtained for frs 265 show the presence of an additional methyl group compared to saluamine an frs hydrolysis product cruz et al 1979 laurence et al 2014 the formation of frs 265 can be explained by cleavage of the substituent on the α carbon after furan ring opening the formation of the other transformation products can be explained by transformation of the furan and secondary amine moieties leading to carbonyls frs 308 frs 363 and hydroxylamines frs 266 frs 308 frs 363 the chemical structures of the observed ozonation products suggest the relevance of two reaction pathways involving the opening of the furan ring fig 1 the nal assay was used to assess whether α β unsaturated dicarbonyls other than frs 347 are formed from the transformation of frs bda was detected as a bda nal adduct indicating the relevance of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl formation from the ozone oxidation of furan rings even though yields were low 0 1 bda and its substituted analogues have been identified as rat liver microsomal metabolites of furan and furan containing compounds chen et al 1995 peterson 2013 the ozone dose dependent formation of bda and other frs ozonation products is shown in figure s12 for ran twelve ozonation products were detected with two of them being formed by reaction of ozone with the furan ring figures s13 s14 s15 and table s4 similar to results obtained by christophoridis et al 2016 the lc hrms data indicate potential oxidation at different positions of the molecule however in contrast to christophoridis et al 2016 who observed only one ozonation product containing an additional oxygen atom c13h22n4o4s and identified it as ran s oxide two peaks with the same exact mass but distinct ms2 spectra were detected in the present study figure s14a and s14b for the first peak retention time 3 7 min the presence of ms2 fragments m z 188 0738 c8h14o2ns and 192 0435 c5h10o3n3s indicates the oxidation of the thioether and thus the formation of the ran s oxide in contrast the absence of both fragments in the ms2 spectrum of the second peak retention time 8 9 min and the detection of fragment 270 0902 c11h16o3n3s which is formed via cleavage of a c2h7on group suggests the oxidation of the tertiary amine group and thus the formation of the ran n oxide the formation of both n and s oxides is further supported by the detection of ran s n oxide c13h22n4o5s and the ms2 results for this compound figure s14c the formation of other products also indicates the oxidation of the tertiary amine group figure s14e and s14h however due to the absence of reference standards no final conclusions can be drawn transformation products formed during the electrochemical oxidation of ran have been shown to be more toxic than the parent compound olvera vargas et al 2014 emphasizing the need to elucidate the properties of and the risk posed by the ozonation products of ran although all the ran sub structures react with ozone with high rates jeon et al 2016 the obtained results primarily demonstrated the formation of ozonation products in which the furan ring remains unmodified the detection of ran 252 and ran 236 also indicated the oxidation of the furan moiety leading to cleavage of parts of the molecule figure s14i and s14j however it is possible that more ozonation products resulting from oxidation of the furan ring were formed but could not be detected by lc hrms analysis no α β unsaturated dicarbonyl products were detected directly or after derivatization by nal or a nal nac mixture therefore dicarbonyls are either not formed from ran or are degraded further 3 2 2 ozonation products of substituted furans based on the results of the furan containing pharmaceuticals the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyls bda and bda rs from simpler substituted furans was investigated to determine how different substituents impact the formation of these toxic by products the results for seven tested compounds are summarised in table 2 and details are provided in the si table s2 and figures s4 s10 concentrations of bda were determined using a reference standard due to the absence of reference standards the yields of bda rs were determined by comparing the lc hrms peak areas of their nal adducts with those obtained for bda the yields of bda and bda analogues were strongly dependent on the substituents present in different furans ozonation of ffa led to the formation of bda at a maximum molar yield of 2 4 fig 2 this is comparable to the bda yields formed from uv h2o2 oxidation of phenol in water prasse et al 2018 traces of bda were also detected in the reaction solutions before the addition of ozone this indicates the potential formation of bda via hydrolysis of ffa which aligns with previous reports on the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of furans stamhuis et al 1964 besides bda a second c4 dicarbonyl compound containing an additional hydroxymethyl group nal adduct c13h21o5n2 m z 285 1444 was identified in experiments with ffa bda r in fig 2 the maximum relative yield of this compound was approximately 0 5 the ms2 spectrum of this adduct figure s5 contained characteristic masses m z 84 0813 and 126 0914 previously observed for nal adducts of other dicarbonyls prasse et al 2018 ozonation of bhf did not lead to bda formation despite the structural similarity of bhf and ffa however the formation of a nal adduct with m z 315 1548 was detected in trace amounts which can be attributed to the formation of a dialdehyde containing two hydroxymethyl substituents figure s6 bda was also identified as an ozonation product of fa at higher molar yields of approximately 7 which was the maximum yield observed in this study in comparison chlorination of phenols has been shown to result in the formation of bda rs at yields ranging from 18 to 46 prasse et al 2020 no other nal adducts were detected in fa experiments for mfa a bda analogue with a carboxyl and a methyl group attached was detected figs 3 and s8 while ozonation of fpa led to formation of both bda and a dicarbonyl with a propanoic acid group attached figs 3 and s7 the bda molar yield was less than 0 1 in the case of fpa while the propanoic acid substituted bda analogue appeared to be a more important ozonation product with a maximum yield of 2 7 no nal or nac adducts were detected in ozonation of fdca in agreement with the results observed for ran indicating that the presence of two carboxyl substituents impacts both the reaction kinetics and the ozonation pathway the absence of a dimethylated bda analogue in experiments with dmf can most likely be explained by the inability of this compound to react with nal in the same way as the other dicarbonyl compounds detected due to the presence of methyl substituents at both α carbons to verify this additional experiments in the presence of both nal and nac were performed and revealed the formation of both nac and nal nac adducts figures s9 and s10 in contrast to nal which primarily reacts with α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds via schiff base formation i e reaction at the carbonyl carbon reactions of thiols can be attributed to michael addition i e reaction at the double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group lopachin and gavin 2014 the formed thiol adducts can then react in a second step with nal yielding pyrrole products figure s16 the results demonstrate that α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds are relevant ozonation products of furans the yields are generally low 7 thus indicating the simultaneous formation of other ozonation products in addition the results show that bda and bda analogues can be transformed further by ozone figure s3 in the gas phase bda reacts with ozone with a rate constant of 1 6 10 18 cm3 molecule 1 s 1 liu et al 1999 based on gas phase ozonation studies of bda and other related compounds the products formed from the further oxidation of bda include formaldehyde glyoxal and methylglyoxal liu et al 1999 tuazon et al 1985 these were not analysed in this study but are the subject of ongoing investigations 3 3 postulated mechanism for the reaction of furans with ozone leading to α β unsaturated dicarbonyls even though no information is available about the transformation of furans by ozone in water previous studies performed in organic solvents have suggested the potential contribution of different reaction mechanisms leading to opening of the furan ring bailey and colomb 1957 bailey et al 1965 jibben and wibaut 1960 our detection of c4 dicarbonyls bda analogues confirms the importance of electrophilic ozone attack at the reactive α c positions of the furan ring via reaction of ozone with either one or both α carbons fig 4 bailey 1982 the yields of bda and substituted bda analogues however suggest ozonolysis of furans via reaction with the α β double bonds as dominant reaction pathway and or further reactions of the c4 dicarbonyls with ozone similar to reaction kinetics the obtained results further indicate that the yield and type of the formed α β unsaturated dicarbonyls strongly depend on the substituents of the parent compound and their position on the furan ring two of the tested compounds mfa and bhf have substituents on the β carbon of the furan ring labelled as r3 and r4 in tables 1 and 2 both the carboxyl group of mfa and the hydroxymethyl groups of bhf were retained on the formed dicarbonyl compounds after ring opening table 2 the results of furans containing substituents on the α carbon labelled as r2 and r5 in tables 1 and 2 are less consistent for the ozonation of 2 5 diarylfurans in organic solvents dicarbonyls containing aryl substituents on both carbonyl carbons have been reported bailey et al 1965 white et al 1965 as demonstrated in this study a similar mechanism is also relevant under aqueous conditions for mfa fpa and dmf all of which formed dicarbonyls with their α c substituents still attached table 2 this indicates that the reaction of ozone with furans containing alkyl substituents on the α carbon also results in the formation of bda analogues with the substituents retained in contrast results obtained for furans containing either hydroxymethyl or carboxylic acid substituents at one of the α carbons indicate the relevance of reactions leading to cleavage of the substituent and formation of bda this is particularly true for fa for which only the formation of bda but not bda r was observed the differences in yield of bda versus bda r for fa ffa and fpa reveal the significant influence of these α c substituents on the mechanism of bda formation fa is predominantly present as a carboxylate anion pka 3 0 under neutral ph which is an electron donating group while the aldehyde and alkene groups are electron withdrawing arena et al 1993 thus one of the potential explanations for bda formation during aqueous ozonation is through hydrolysis of the bda carboxylate yielding e 4 hydroxybuta 1 3 dien 1 one as intermediate which is unstable and reacts further to bda figure s17 lin and huang 2018 yoshimi et al 2010 similar reaction mechanisms leading to the removal of the hydroxymethyl and propanoic acid anion group can also be postulated for ffa and fpa respectively figure s17 furthermore the descending trend of electron donating capacity from carboxylate anion to hydroxymethyl and propanoic acid groups is in good agreement with the decreasing yield of bda versus bda rs differences in the degradation of ffa and bda in experiments performed in the presence and absence of tert butanol as a oh radical scavenger figure s3 were minor however the presence of tert butanol appeared to have some effect on the formed concentration of bda and bda r figure s2 the increased formation in the absence of tert butanol indicates that bda analogues can be formed both from reactions with ozone and with oh radicals 4 conclusions the selected organic compounds containing furan rings have a high ozone reactivity that is comparable to that of activated benzene rings and are therefore expected to be efficiently eliminated in water and wastewater ozonation treatment further research is required to elucidate the effect of deactivating substituents such as halogens on the ozonation rate constant of furans in complex water matrices containing various furan bearing compounds ozonation is likely to result in the formation of a mixture of α β unsaturated dicarbonyls depending on the applied ozone dose the dicarbonyls may decompose into smaller aldehydes and carboxylic acids future studies will focus on the detection of these further transformation products in real water treatment systems in addition it needs to be assessed whether α β unsaturated dicarbonyls can be removed during post treatment steps for example activated carbon and biofiltration the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyls such as bda and its analogues though only representing a small portion of transformation products from ozonation of furans is a health concern due to their reported toxicity furans play an increasing role as green chemicals and are also formed by natural processes in the aquatic environment the obtained results highlight the necessity to investigate the

16696,despite the widespread occurrence of furan moieties in synthetic and natural compounds their fate in aqueous ozonation has not been investigated in detail reaction rate constants of seven commonly used furans with ozone were measured and ranged from ko3 8 5 104 to 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 depending on the type and position of furan ring substituents transformation product analysis of the reaction of furans with ozone focusing on the formation of toxic organic electrophiles using a novel amino acid reactivity assay revealed the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds 2 butene 1 4 dial bda and its substituted analogues bda rs their formation can be attributed to ozone attack at the reactive α c position leading to furan ring opening the molar yields of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds varied with the applied ozone concentration reaching maximum values of 7 for 2 furoic acid the identified α β unsaturated dicarbonyls are well known toxicophores that are also formed by enzymatic oxidation of furans in the human body in addition to providing data on kinetics transformation product analysis and proposed reaction mechanisms for the ozonation of furans this

abstract keywords organic micropollutants transformation products reactivity directed analysis dicarbonyls toxic by products 1 introduction furans are heterocyclic aromatics comprising a five membered ring of four carbons and one oxygen atom the use of furan derivatives for the production of biomass derived fuels polymers and other chemicals has dramatically increased over the last decades eldeeb and akih kumgeh 2018 gandini et al 2016 keay and dibble 1996 tong et al 2010 furfural a commodity chemical and precursor of many other furans has a global production capacity of 280 kton per year with 65 used to produce furfuryl alcohol mariscal et al 2016 in addition to their industrial applications furans are common moieties in a variety of naturally occurring compounds including terpenes and fatty acids and can be formed abiotically from the oxidation of natural organic matter hannemann et al 1989 huber et al 2010 wang et al 2014 the extensive use of furan containing chemicals and their natural occurrence make them likely contaminants in wastewater and drinking water resources as evidenced by the detection of furan containing compounds particularly pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluent and surface water jelic et al 2011 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 kostich et al 2014 ozonation is increasingly used for the removal of trace organic contaminants in wastewater treatment

von gunten 2012 transformation products of the ozonation of organic compounds include carbonyls formed by cleavage of olefinic bonds or benzene rings n oxides and hydroxylamines by oxidation of amines and sulfoxides by oxidation of thioethers hübner et al 2015 lee and von gunten 2016 the identification of ozone transformation products with eco toxicological implications is of importance von gunten 2018 for example the main ozonation product of carboxy acyclovir inhibits the growth of green algae an effect not observed for the parent compound schlüter vorberg et al 2015 similarly embryotoxicity in a zebrafish assay was observed for the ozonation products of carbamazepine while no effects were observed for carbamazepine itself pohl et al 2020 despite extensive research on the reaction of ozone with several classes of organic compounds including olefins phenols and nitrogen containing compounds zoumpouli et al 2020 studies focussing on the transformation of furans during aqueous ozonation are limited the dimethylfuran moiety present in the antacid drug ranitidine has been shown to contribute to the high reactivity of this compound with ozone jeon et al 2016 however no transformation products that are specific for the reaction of ozone with the furan moiety were reported christophoridis et al 2016 zou et al 2018 for the diuretic drug furosemide two ozonation products were identified indicating the potential relevance of cleavage and or opening of the furan ring by ozone aalizadeh et al 2019 studies investigating the reaction of furans with ozone in organic solvents or organic solvent water mixtures suggest the potential involvement of different reaction mechanisms bailey and colomb 1957 bailey et al 1965 jibben and wibaut 1960 white et al 1965 jibben and wibaut 1960 identified glyoxal a c2 dicarbonyl as the sole ozone transformation product of furan and attributed its formation to the reaction of ozone with the two carbon carbon double bonds α β bonds of the furan ring leading to a c2 dicarbonyl containing both β c atoms and or to β β addition of ozone leading to two c2 dicarbonyls that contain one α and one β c atom of the furan ring see table 1 for nomenclature in contrast bailey and colomb 1957 and bailey et al 1965 observed the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds containing all four carbons of the furan ring in experiments with diarylfurans such as 2 5 diphenylfuran the results of bailey et al indicate the relevance of two distinct reaction pathways i ozonolysis of a carbon carbon double bond α β bond and ii electrophilic ozone attack at the reactive α c position in either a bidentate or monodentate manner followed by ring cleavage to form a c4 dicarbonyl bailey 1982 these c4 dicarbonyls then form lower molecular weight transformation products through further reaction with ozone bailey 1982 given the absence of kinetic and mechanistic information on the ozonation of furans in aqueous solutions the aim of this study was to determine the ozonation kinetics of various commonly used furans and elucidate the formation of ozonation products in water the specific focus was on the formation of toxic α β unsaturated dicarbonyl transformation products which have been recently identified as novel highly toxic by products formed during the oxidation of phenols with various oxidants including hydroxyl radicals and chlorine prasse et al 2018 prasse et al 2020 in addition α β unsaturated dicarbonyls are also formed during the enzymatic oxidation of furans in the human body catalyzed by cytochrome p450 and are responsible for their toxicity chen et al 1995 peterson 2013 ravindranath et al 1984 the studied furans included two high usage pharmaceuticals furosemide ranitidine that can be frequently found in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants kostich et al 2014 and seven high production volume industrial chemicals furfuryl alcohol 2 furoic acid 2 5 dimethylfuran 2 methyl 3

chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms in addition an amino acid reactivity assay was used to specifically assess the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyls that cannot be directly

18 mω cm 1 produced with a milli q merck or elga veolia water purification system 2 2 ozonation experiments competition kinetics experiments were performed to determine the second order rate constants for the reaction of furans with ozone in pure water buffered at ph 7 10 mm phosphate buffer 10 mm tert butanol ran was used as the reference compound due to its known reaction rate constant with ozone jeon et al 2016 and since initial tests had shown that most of the target furans had an ozone reactivity within approximately one order of magnitude of ran for compounds that reacted with ozone with much lower reaction rate constants than ran fa was used as the reference compound after determining its rate constant using ran further details on competition kinetics experiments and calculations are provided in the si supplementary text s1 batch ozonation experiments to study the formation of transformation products of furans were performed in 20 ml amber glass vials the reaction solutions 10 ml contained 15 μm of the target compound and 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 diluted with ultrapure water after sampling the initial solution a volume of concentrated ozone stock solution see si supplementary text s1 was added to achieve concentrations of 4 to 65 μm ozone 0 3 to 4 3 μm o3 μm target compound the samples were left uncapped at room temperature for approximately 2 hours to

prasse et al 2018 prasse et al 2020 the reaction of nal with α β unsaturated dicarbonyls leads to the formation of nal adducts which can be detected using lc hrms see section 2 3 prasse et al 2018 to this end a small volume of a nal stock solution was added to the samples final concentration 150 μm equivalent to 10 times the initial concentration of the parent compound followed by incubation at room temperature for 24 hours selected experiments were repeated with higher concentration of the target compound up to 100 μμ to facilitate the identification of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl transformation products additionally for some samples an equimolar mixture of nal and nac stock solutions was used instead of the nal stock solution to enable the detection of dicarbonyls that do not form adducts with nal alone but do form nac or nal nac adducts prasse et al 2018 all samples were analyzed within 48 hours 2 3 analytical approaches spectrophotometric measurements to determine ozone

provided in the si supplementary text s2 2 butene 1 4 dial bda the α β unsaturated dicarbonyl identified in this work was quantified with standard addition calibration curves based on lc hrms analysis of its nal adduct similar to a method described previously prasse et al 2018 stock solutions of bda 1 mm were prepared through hydrolysis of 2 5 dihydro 2 5 dimethoxyfuran in ultrapure water at room temperature for at least 24 hours for each experiment standard addition was applied on one of the samples and the slope of the curve was used for the other samples of that experiment the limit of detection of bda in ultrapure water buffered at ph 7 was 1 nm lowest standard with a signal to noise ratio 3 and the limit of quantification was 10 nm lowest standard with signal to noise ratio 10 ozonation yields of bda were calculated by dividing the molar concentration of bda with the molar concentration of the parent compound that reacted difference between initial and final concentrations yields of other bda analogues bda rs without a standard available were estimated using bda as reference standard 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of the reaction of substituted furans with ozone table 1 shows the second order rate constants for the reaction of nine furans with ozone ko3 in water at ph 7 including two values that were available in the literature the competition kinetics plots for seven of the furans are provided in figure s1 initial tests indicated that the studied furans have a high ozone reactivity which was expected based on the aromaticity of the furan ring competition kinetics experiments showed that the ko3 of fpa mfa frs ffa and bhf varies only by a factor of 2 1 7 0 2 to 3 2 0 2 106 m 1 s 1 while reaction rates for fa and fdca were lower 5 9 0 5 105 and 8 5 0 7 104 m 1 s 1 respectively the ozone reactivity of most tested furans is comparable to that of phenols and anilines at ph 7 lee and von gunten 2012 our results suggest that steric effects due to the presence of substituents do not play an important role which is in agreement with results obtained by bailey et al 1965 for the ozonation of diarylfurans therefore the observed differences of reaction kinetics are most likely attributable to the type of substituents e g electron withdrawing versus electron donating and their positions e g located at an α carbon versus at a β carbon on the furan ring electron donating substituents such as hydroxyl and methyl groups increase the electron density of the furan ring and are therefore expected to enhance its ozone reactivity while electron withdrawing groups such as carboxyl groups have the opposite impact similar to effects observed for phenols lee and von gunten 2012 the three acids fpa mfa and fa have pka values ranging from 3 to 4 4 arena et al 1993 hence they are all dissociated at ph 7 in contrast to the carboxyl group the carboxylate anion exerts an electro donating effect hansch et al 1991 the higher reaction rate constant of mfa compared to fa can likely be explained by the presence of an additional alkyl group and or the presence of a carboxylate substituent at a β rather than an α carbon in fpa the carboxylate group is separated from the furan ring by two additional carbons c2h4 group compared to fa leading to a 5 fold increase of the rate constant comparison of the kinetics of fdca and fa indicates that the presence of an additional carboxylate group 2 5 substitution of fdca versus 2 substitution of fa lowers the ozone reactivity by approximately one order of magnitude the relatively low rate constant of dmf with ozone that has been reported in the literature table 1 further indicates slower reaction kinetics for furans containing substituents at both α carbons 2 5 substitution in contrast bhf 3 4 substitution had the same rate constant as ffa 2 substitution indicating that substituents located at β carbons have a lower impact on the reaction rates further experiments with a more diverse group of furan compounds are necessary to develop quantitative structure activity relationships qsars for substituted furans in oxidative water treatment processes similar to those that have been developed for other compound classes such as phenols and amines lee et al 2015 lee and von gunten 2012 ran contains multiple sites contributing to its high ozone reactivity the furan ring a tertiary amine a thioether and an acetamidine which is the most reactive moiety jeon et al 2016 similarly the high rate constant of frs can be attributed to both a furan ring and an aniline moiety based on qsar calculations the ko3 of frs has been reported as 6 8 104 m 1 s 1 which was the sum of the contributions of the secondary amine pka 3 8 ko3 6 2 104 m 1 s 1 and the benzene ring partly deactivated ko3 6 5 103 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2014 this predicted ko3 of frs is similar to the experimentally determined reactivity of compounds with a p sulfonylaniline moiety dodd et al 2006 the qsar model however did not consider the reactivity of the furan ring which explains why the ko3 determined experimentally for frs in this study ko3 2 2 106 m 1 s 1 is significantly higher than the value predicted by qsar 3 2 transformation of furans by ozone in water in addition to determining the ozonation kinetics of furans the formation of transformation products was investigated of particular interest was the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds due to their potential toxicity and their recent identification in oxidative water treatment processes prasse et al 2018 prasse et al 2020 ozonation products were detected either directly with lc hrms or after derivatization with either nal or a mixture of nal and nac so called reactivity directed analysis rda assays prasse 2021 oh radicals were not scavenged in these experiments in order to represent real ozonation conditions where both ozone and oh radicals are present 3 2 1 transformation of furan containing pharmaceuticals for frs seven ozonation products were detected table s3 and figure s11 the lc hrms results exact mass ms2 spectra indicate that the benzene ring including the chlorine sulfonamide and carboxyl moieties remained unmodified in all ozonation products which is in agreement with the deactivating effect of these three benzene substituents as such oxidation of frs can be attributed to the reaction of ozone with the furfurylamine group with frs 278 being the only detected compound that has been previously reported for the reaction with ozone aalizadeh et al 2019 based on the obtained results the reaction of ozone with the α carbon of the furan moiety is indicated to result in the opening of the furan ring see section 3 3 for more details leading to the formation of an α β unsaturated dicarbonyl transformation product frs 347 which has been observed previously in oxidation of frs in microsomes williams et al 2007 the presence of an α β unsaturated dicarbonyl group is supported by the presence of fragment m z 262 9885 c8h8o4n2cls in the ms2 spectrum of frs 347 which indicates the cleavage of a c4h4o2 moiety formation of frs 328 which has been identified in the oxidation of frs by dimethyldioxirane can most likely be attributed to the intramolecular reaction between the ketoenal group and the amine moiety of frs 347 chen and burka 2007 the formation of a ring condensation product is supported by the absence of ms2 fragments that indicate cleavage of carbon containing moieties furthermore the observed ms2 spectrum is very similar to the results obtained by laurence et al 2014 who used a reference standard for the confirmation of the chemical structure of this compound frs 328 is also formed as a product of anodic and electro fenton oxidation of frs laurencé et al 2011 laurence et al 2014 and has been identified as a human metabolite of frs with evidence that it is a physio pathologically relevant neurodegeneration inducer laurence et al 2019 lc hrms results obtained for frs 265 show the presence of an additional methyl group compared to saluamine an frs hydrolysis product cruz et al 1979 laurence et al 2014 the formation of frs 265 can be explained by cleavage of the substituent on the α carbon after furan ring opening the formation of the other transformation products can be explained by transformation of the furan and secondary amine moieties leading to carbonyls frs 308 frs 363 and hydroxylamines frs 266 frs 308 frs 363 the chemical structures of the observed ozonation products suggest the relevance of two reaction pathways involving the opening of the furan ring fig 1 the nal assay was used to assess whether α β unsaturated dicarbonyls other than frs 347 are formed from the transformation of frs bda was detected as a bda nal adduct indicating the relevance of α β unsaturated dicarbonyl formation from the ozone oxidation of furan rings even though yields were low 0 1 bda and its substituted analogues have been identified as rat liver microsomal metabolites of furan and furan containing compounds chen et al 1995 peterson 2013 the ozone dose dependent formation of bda and other frs ozonation products is shown in figure s12 for ran twelve ozonation products were detected with two of them being formed by reaction of ozone with the furan ring figures s13 s14 s15 and table s4 similar to results obtained by christophoridis et al 2016 the lc hrms data indicate potential oxidation at different positions of the molecule however in contrast to christophoridis et al 2016 who observed only one ozonation product containing an additional oxygen atom c13h22n4o4s and identified it as ran s oxide two peaks with the same exact mass but distinct ms2 spectra were detected in the present study figure s14a and s14b for the first peak retention time 3 7 min the presence of ms2 fragments m z 188 0738 c8h14o2ns and 192 0435 c5h10o3n3s indicates the oxidation of the thioether and thus the formation of the ran s oxide in contrast the absence of both fragments in the ms2 spectrum of the second peak retention time 8 9 min and the detection of fragment 270 0902 c11h16o3n3s which is formed via cleavage of a c2h7on group suggests the oxidation of the tertiary amine group and thus the formation of the ran n oxide the formation of both n and s oxides is further supported by the detection of ran s n oxide c13h22n4o5s and the ms2 results for this compound figure s14c the formation of other products also indicates the oxidation of the tertiary amine group figure s14e and s14h however due to the absence of reference standards no final conclusions can be drawn transformation products formed during the electrochemical oxidation of ran have been shown to be more toxic than the parent compound olvera vargas et al 2014 emphasizing the need to elucidate the properties of and the risk posed by the ozonation products of ran although all the ran sub structures react with ozone with high rates jeon et al 2016 the obtained results primarily demonstrated the formation of ozonation products in which the furan ring remains unmodified the detection of ran 252 and ran 236 also indicated the oxidation of the furan moiety leading to cleavage of parts of the molecule figure s14i and s14j however it is possible that more ozonation products resulting from oxidation of the furan ring were formed but could not be detected by lc hrms analysis no α β unsaturated dicarbonyl products were detected directly or after derivatization by nal or a nal nac mixture therefore dicarbonyls are either not formed from ran or are degraded further 3 2 2 ozonation products of substituted furans based on the results of the furan containing pharmaceuticals the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyls bda and bda rs from simpler substituted furans was investigated to determine how different substituents impact the formation of these toxic by products the results for seven tested compounds are summarised in table 2 and details are provided in the si table s2 and figures s4 s10 concentrations of bda were determined using a reference standard due to the absence of reference standards the yields of bda rs were determined by comparing the lc hrms peak areas of their nal adducts with those obtained for bda the yields of bda and bda analogues were strongly dependent on the substituents present in different furans ozonation of ffa led to the formation of bda at a maximum molar yield of 2 4 fig 2 this is comparable to the bda yields formed from uv h2o2 oxidation of phenol in water prasse et al 2018 traces of bda were also detected in the reaction solutions before the addition of ozone this indicates the potential formation of bda via hydrolysis of ffa which aligns with previous reports on the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of furans stamhuis et al 1964 besides bda a second c4 dicarbonyl compound containing an additional hydroxymethyl group nal adduct c13h21o5n2 m z 285 1444 was identified in experiments with ffa bda r in fig 2 the maximum relative yield of this compound was approximately 0 5 the ms2 spectrum of this adduct figure s5 contained characteristic masses m z 84 0813 and 126 0914 previously observed for nal adducts of other dicarbonyls prasse et al 2018 ozonation of bhf did not lead to bda formation despite the structural similarity of bhf and ffa however the formation of a nal adduct with m z 315 1548 was detected in trace amounts which can be attributed to the formation of a dialdehyde containing two hydroxymethyl substituents figure s6 bda was also identified as an ozonation product of fa at higher molar yields of approximately 7 which was the maximum yield observed in this study in comparison chlorination of phenols has been shown to result in the formation of bda rs at yields ranging from 18 to 46 prasse et al 2020 no other nal adducts were detected in fa experiments for mfa a bda analogue with a carboxyl and a methyl group attached was detected figs 3 and s8 while ozonation of fpa led to formation of both bda and a dicarbonyl with a propanoic acid group attached figs 3 and s7 the bda molar yield was less than 0 1 in the case of fpa while the propanoic acid substituted bda analogue appeared to be a more important ozonation product with a maximum yield of 2 7 no nal or nac adducts were detected in ozonation of fdca in agreement with the results observed for ran indicating that the presence of two carboxyl substituents impacts both the reaction kinetics and the ozonation pathway the absence of a dimethylated bda analogue in experiments with dmf can most likely be explained by the inability of this compound to react with nal in the same way as the other dicarbonyl compounds detected due to the presence of methyl substituents at both α carbons to verify this additional experiments in the presence of both nal and nac were performed and revealed the formation of both nac and nal nac adducts figures s9 and s10 in contrast to nal which primarily reacts with α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds via schiff base formation i e reaction at the carbonyl carbon reactions of thiols can be attributed to michael addition i e reaction at the double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group lopachin and gavin 2014 the formed thiol adducts can then react in a second step with nal yielding pyrrole products figure s16 the results demonstrate that α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds are relevant ozonation products of furans the yields are generally low 7 thus indicating the simultaneous formation of other ozonation products in addition the results show that bda and bda analogues can be transformed further by ozone figure s3 in the gas phase bda reacts with ozone with a rate constant of 1 6 10 18 cm3 molecule 1 s 1 liu et al 1999 based on gas phase ozonation studies of bda and other related compounds the products formed from the further oxidation of bda include formaldehyde glyoxal and methylglyoxal liu et al 1999 tuazon et al 1985 these were not analysed in this study but are the subject of ongoing investigations 3 3 postulated mechanism for the reaction of furans with ozone leading to α β unsaturated dicarbonyls even though no information is available about the transformation of furans by ozone in water previous studies performed in organic solvents have suggested the potential contribution of different reaction mechanisms leading to opening of the furan ring bailey and colomb 1957 bailey et al 1965 jibben and wibaut 1960 our detection of c4 dicarbonyls bda analogues confirms the importance of electrophilic ozone attack at the reactive α c positions of the furan ring via reaction of ozone with either one or both α carbons fig 4 bailey 1982 the yields of bda and substituted bda analogues however suggest ozonolysis of furans via reaction with the α β double bonds as dominant reaction pathway and or further reactions of the c4 dicarbonyls with ozone similar to reaction kinetics the obtained results further indicate that the yield and type of the formed α β unsaturated dicarbonyls strongly depend on the substituents of the parent compound and their position on the furan ring two of the tested compounds mfa and bhf have substituents on the β carbon of the furan ring labelled as r3 and r4 in tables 1 and 2 both the carboxyl group of mfa and the hydroxymethyl groups of bhf were retained on the formed dicarbonyl compounds after ring opening table 2 the results of furans containing substituents on the α carbon labelled as r2 and r5 in tables 1 and 2 are less consistent for the ozonation of 2 5 diarylfurans in organic solvents dicarbonyls containing aryl substituents on both carbonyl carbons have been reported bailey et al 1965 white et al 1965 as demonstrated in this study a similar mechanism is also relevant under aqueous conditions for mfa fpa and dmf all of which formed dicarbonyls with their α c substituents still attached table 2 this indicates that the reaction of ozone with furans containing alkyl substituents on the α carbon also results in the formation of bda analogues with the substituents retained in contrast results obtained for furans containing either hydroxymethyl or carboxylic acid substituents at one of the α carbons indicate the relevance of reactions leading to cleavage of the substituent and formation of bda this is particularly true for fa for which only the formation of bda but not bda r was observed the differences in yield of bda versus bda r for fa ffa and fpa reveal the significant influence of these α c substituents on the mechanism of bda formation fa is predominantly present as a carboxylate anion pka 3 0 under neutral ph which is an electron donating group while the aldehyde and alkene groups are electron withdrawing arena et al 1993 thus one of the potential explanations for bda formation during aqueous ozonation is through hydrolysis of the bda carboxylate yielding e 4 hydroxybuta 1 3 dien 1 one as intermediate which is unstable and reacts further to bda figure s17 lin and huang 2018 yoshimi et al 2010 similar reaction mechanisms leading to the removal of the hydroxymethyl and propanoic acid anion group can also be postulated for ffa and fpa respectively figure s17 furthermore the descending trend of electron donating capacity from carboxylate anion to hydroxymethyl and propanoic acid groups is in good agreement with the decreasing yield of bda versus bda rs differences in the degradation of ffa and bda in experiments performed in the presence and absence of tert butanol as a oh radical scavenger figure s3 were minor however the presence of tert butanol appeared to have some effect on the formed concentration of bda and bda r figure s2 the increased formation in the absence of tert butanol indicates that bda analogues can be formed both from reactions with ozone and with oh radicals 4 conclusions the selected organic compounds containing furan rings have a high ozone reactivity that is comparable to that of activated benzene rings and are therefore expected to be efficiently eliminated in water and wastewater ozonation treatment further research is required to elucidate the effect of deactivating substituents such as halogens on the ozonation rate constant of furans in complex water matrices containing various furan bearing compounds ozonation is likely to result in the formation of a mixture of α β unsaturated dicarbonyls depending on the applied ozone dose the dicarbonyls may decompose into smaller aldehydes and carboxylic acids future studies will focus on the detection of these further transformation products in real water treatment systems in addition it needs to be assessed whether α β unsaturated dicarbonyls can be removed during post treatment steps for example activated carbon and biofiltration the formation of α β unsaturated dicarbonyls such as bda and its analogues though only representing a small portion of transformation products from ozonation of furans is a health concern due to their reported toxicity furans play an increasing role as green chemicals and are also formed by natural processes in the aquatic environment the obtained results highlight the necessity to investigate the fate of these compounds in water treatment systems to assess the potential exposures to toxic by products declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16697,efficient and sustainable removal of phosphate ions from an aqueous solution is of great challenge herein we demonstrated a greener route for phosphate recovery through struvite formation by using bacterial siderophore this method was efficient for removal of phosphate as low as 1 3 mm with 99 recovery efficiency the siderophore produced by pseudomonas taiwanensis r 12 2 act as template for the nucleation of struvite crystals and was found sustainable for recycling the phosphorous efficiently after twenty cycles the formation of struvite crystals is driven by surrounding ph 9 0 and presence of mg2 and nh4 ions along with po4 3 and siderophore which was further validated by computational studies the morphology of struvite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy followed by elemental analysis furthermore our results revealed that the siderophore plays an important role in struvite biomineralization we have successfully demonstrated the phosphate sequestration by using industrial waste samples as possible application for environmental sustainability and phosphate conservation for the first time electrochemical super capacitance performance of the struvite was studied the specific capacitance value for the struvite was found to be 320 f g 1 at 1 87 a g 1 and retained 92 capacitance after 250 cycles the study revealed the potential implications of siderophore for the phosphate recycling and the new mechanism for biomineralization by sequestering into struvite graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords siderophore struvite

2004 in all the biochemical processes phosphorus has major role and is well known for its importance in dna chemistry phosphorus is the most important macro element in the entire biosphere next to the nitrogen needed for the biological processes due to mining the phosphorus reservoirs have been depleted to meet the global demands of phosphate fertilizers gilbert 2009 an efficient method for phosphate recovery can help to solve this problem there are several ways to removes the phosphorus from the environment such as struvite precipitation from wastewater treatment drainages and wastewater lagoons le corre et al 2009 this is one of the proven methodologies to be used for the recovery of phosphorus from the wastewater effluents where the phosphate concentration is high le corre et al 2009 struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate hexa hydrate mgnh4po4 6h2o is one of the best fertilizers that provides three important macro elements such as n p and mg in a single unique combination struvite is a kind of slow fertilizer releaser gull and pasek 2013 because of its poor water solubility and it can be stored in the soil for longer periods for the release of macroelements slowly from the fertilizer lee et al 2009 phosphate recovery in the form of struvite crystals from wastewater treatment plant or livestock waste is of major concern it needs to be carried out by controlling the ph by alkali dosing and co2 stripping which increases the cost of struvite production and also hampers the reaction rate of the struvite formation le corre et al 2009 the ca2 k and other ions present in the waste samples also interfere and easily get introduced and co precipitated with struvite which leads to the formation of struvite variants hao et al 2008 the rapid precipitation may cause the formation of smaller particle size as a result it reduces the potentials of crystal growth and also increase the cost of the process for large scales hao et al 2013 mayer et al 2016 pastor et al 2010 struvite crystallization occurs naturally in the diverse biological ecosystems biochemical and physiological changes occur in these environments are through microbial metabolism that induces the combination of ions such as ammonia phosphate and magnesium rivadeneyra et al 1983 there are number of different environments studied for the struvite crystallization especially from anaerobic digester maqueda et al 1994 pastor et al 2010 waste of animal farming liquid huang et al 2015 and municipal treatment plants le corre et al 2009 parsons and smith 2008 another approach used for struvite crystallization was using urine and synthetic urine of humans as well as animals as a source of phosphorus ronteltap et al 2010 chemically synthesized struvite could also be obtained by mixing the equimolar concentrations of ammonia phosphorus and magnesium salts kurtulus and tas 2011 microbial activities in various ecosystems plays a key role in the formation of various minerals including struvite frankel and bazylinski 2003 gadd 2010 there are number of microbial isolates viz trypanosoma cruzi adroher et al 1988 arthrobacter sp pseudomonas sp pérez garcía et al 1990 proteus mirabilis prywer and torzewska 2010 myxococcus sp omar et al 1998 enterobacter sp emb19 sinha et al 2014 and acinetobacter calcoaceticus srb4 han et al 2015 reported in the lab scale studies for struvite biomineralization microorganisms synthesizes low molecular weight ferric ion specific chelating agents known as siderophores under iron starvation conditions these siderophores are released for acquisition of iron after binding to iron molecule it transports back to organism via high affinity and receptor dependent transport system the regulation of the production of siderophores depends on the availability of iron crosa and walsh 2002 there are three major functions of siderophore as a trojan horse strategy for drug delivery plant growth promotion controlling the noxious species in the soil and for solubilization and mobilization of wide range of metal ions 2011 moll et al 2008 schalk et al 2011 a bacterium pseudomonas taiwanensis was initially isolated as a novel bacterial species from the soil by wang et al 2010 and it was reported for its ability to produce siderophores chen et al 2016 thus we used the isolated strain of this bacterium in the present study because of its potential to produce siderophores and to understand extracellular process of the bacterial mediated struvite formation the in vitro formation of struvite by a cell free supernatant and the possible role of bacterial secretory products in the nucleation of media ions was suggested by sinha et al 2014 following this hypothesis of an extracellular mechanism for struvite formation we first investigated the involvement of the bacterial pigment i e siderophore produced from new isolate pseudomonas taiwanensis r 12 2 in struvite crystallization to the best of our knowledge there are no reports on struvite formation from siderophores till date in addition we plan to use it for the crystallization of struvite from phosphate rich industrial waste sample moreover in the past few years mesoporous materials like struvite has been advocated for the supercapacitor applications due to its higher internal areas enabling formation of large number of double layers shiraishi 2003 because of its porous nature it allows rapid electrolyte transfer which results in the charge transfer many transitional metal based composite materials have been tried due to their property of variable oxidation states however less attention was paid towards non transitional phosphate based minerals to be used for the supercapacitor applications rashidi et al 2020 herein we have successfully synthesized the struvite materials using the novel biological route due to multi ions system it provides unique possibility to hold the charge which is an important requirement of the materials for the application in supercapacitor these properties motivated us to study its electrochemical parameter for the supercapacitor 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial strain in our previous study p taiwanensis r 12 2 has been isolated from the tannery soil sample nandre et al 2017 and used for siderophore production and struvite formation in the present study the culture has been deposited in national centre for microbial resource ncmr pune india with accession number pseudomonas taiwanensis mcc 4695 the culture was routinely maintained at 4 c on 0 1 x tryptic soya agar the glycerol stocks 40 were also prepared and maintained at 40 c 2 2 screening of siderophore production and characterization the ability of p taiwanensis r 12 2 to synthesize the siderophore was tested on standard universal chrome azurol sulphonate cas agar plate by spot inoculation the universal cas plate was prepared as reported previously schwyn and neilands 1987 the cas plate was incubated at 30 c for 48 h to check for the formation of orange halo zone around the colony the siderophore production was carried out by growing p taiwanensis r 12 2 in standard succinate broth medium sm meyer and abdallah 1978 after 48 h incubation the media was centrifuged at 8000 g at 4 c and the cell free supernatant was examined for formation of siderophore types by using different chemical tests such as tetrazolium test snow 1954 arnow s test arnow 1937 and carboxylate test vogel 1992 supplementary data a the produced siderophore was diluted in 100 mm tris hcl ph 7 0 and qualitatively analysed by fluorescence spectra jasco fp 8300 japan in the range of 350 to 500 nm wavelength by uv visible absorption spectra baysse et al 2000 2 3 media optimization for siderophore the siderophore production ability of the p taiwanensis r 12 2 was evaluated by growing it initially in standard sm broth meyer and abdallah 1978 composed of g l succinate 4 0 nh4cl 1 0 k2hpo4 3 0 kh2po4 6 0 and mgso4 7h2o 0 2 and ph 7 0 four different combinations of modified succinate broth medium msm were prepared to observe simultaneous formation of siderophore and struvite table 1 all the media components were dissolved in milli q water the p taiwanensis r 12 2 was inoculated 0 05 48 h grown culture in respective sterilized msm mediums in order to increase the production of siderophore 0 05 sterilized deferrated tryptone 3 stock broth was added and flasks were incubated at 30 c with 150 rpm shaking for 48 h the intense greenish yellow fluorescent coloration of the media was observed as an indicator for the production of siderophore 2 4 in vitro struvite formation by siderophore out of four different msm broths table 1 msm a was selected for both siderophore production as well as in vitro struvite formation the media msm a deferrated without fe was used as test and msm a ferrated with 50 µm fe as a biotic control both the flasks were inoculated with p taiwanensis r 12 2 all the flasks were incubated at 30 c for 48 h at 150 rpm the ph of the test flask reached to ph 9 0 after siderophore production from the initial ph 7 0 whereas in biotic control the ph ranged between ph 7 0 8 0 after the growth the flasks were centrifuged at 4 c at 6000 g for 20 min to collect the supernatant the supernatant of test biotic and abiotic control sterilized milli q were adjusted to ph 9 0 biotic and abiotic control served as siderophore free controls which were further used to check for struvite crystallization all the flasks were autoclaved at 15 lbs pressure for 30 min cooled and centrifuged to eliminate any role of proteins in the struvite formation the supernatnats were collected in different separating funnels all the media components of msm a g were added into the respective separating funnels and mixed thoroughly and kept at static condition the precipitate formation was started after 5 min in the test funnel and it is settled down at the bottom of funnel within 10 15 min whereas there was no precipitation observed in the control flasks after 15 min the amount of phosphate was estimated from supernatant by fiske subbarow method fiske and subbarow 1925 the settled precipitate from test flask was collected by filtration washed for 3 4 times with milli q water and dried at 50 c for 12 h after drying the crystals were further characterized and analyzed the above procedure of struvite formation was repeated for twenty times and the phosphate concentration was estimated before and after every cycles the amount of phosphate sequestration phosphate recovery by siderophore was determined 2 5 recovery of phosphate from industrial solid p rich waste sample by using siderophore and its electrochemical applications to study the application of siderophore based in vitro struvite formation on real waste samples we have collected the solid waste sample from phosphate fertilizer industry situated near ranjangaon industrial area pune india in order to precipitate phosphate in the form of struvite industrial solid p rich waste sample 1 0g was dissolved in 100 ml sterilized siderophore solution and 0 25 g of nh4cl and 0 09 g of mgso4 7h2o were added after 15 min the precipitate was collected and characterized while the supernatant was analyzed for phosphate content by fiske subbarow method fiske and subbarow 1925 the abiotic control water was adjusted to ph 9 0 and performed the same above experiment all the experiments were performed in triplicate the electrochemical properties of the formed struvite from industrial waste sample were characterized by a conventional three electrode system in 2 m koh electrolyte at 25 c the struvite 8 0 mg active material along with 1 5 mg of activated carbon and 0 5 mg of polyvinylidene fluoride binder were mixed in n methyl 2 pyrrolidene and sonicated to prepare the ink typical working electrode was prepared by drop casting 1 0 mg of ink on the carbon electrode 1 0 1 0 cm2 platinum foil was used as a counter electrode and hg hgo as a reference electrode to perform cyclic voltammetric studies the potential window of 0 1 0 v was used at different scan rates the galvanostatic charge discharge tests were carried out in the potential range of 0 0 8 v at different current densities 1 87 2 5 3 75 and 5 a g 1 2 6 characterization of struvite crystals the produced struvite crystals were analysed for their morphological characteristics and elemental composition by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem fei nova nanosem 450 equipped with energy dispersive x ray edax spectroscopy bruker xflash 6 30 the x ray powder diffraction pxrd pattern of struvite crystals were characterized by using an ultima iv diffractometer rigaku japan over the 2θ range of 10 80 degrees the sample was prepared as per the standard procedure and the measurements were carried out with the help of goniometer using cukα radiation kα 0 1540562 nm monochromatized with a graphite crystal the produced struvite was confirmed by comparing values with the standard jcpds card number 71 2086 further the ftir spectra of dried powder of struvite crystals were recorded in the scanning range of 400 4000 cm 1 on tensor 37 ftir bruker using kbr struvite crystals of 6 0 mg were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis tga at a atmospheric pressure dta 60h shimadzu thermal gradation was increased at the rate of 10 c per min from 10 1000 c and differential scanning calorimetry dsc dsc 60 shimadzu was performed in the range of 10 300 c at the same conditions 2 7 mechanism of struvite formation by siderophore a computational approach in order to understand the mechanism of siderophore mediated struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o formation further analyzed conformer distribution calculations on different metal ions complexes from our experimental results we predicted two different pathways of struvite formation based on the alteration in the sequence of addition of ions into the siderophore containing media the first pathway is siderophore 6h2o mg2 po4 3 nh4 and the second pathway is siderophore 6h2o mg2 nh4 po4 3 these pathways are distinct from each other due to change in the sequential addition of nh4 and po4 3 ions during the complexation reactions the amino acid sequence of siderophore has been adopted from the previous study chen et al 2016 the initial structure of siderophore was constructed and geometrically optimized by semi empirical pm6 method using spartan 14 molecular modeling software shao et al 2006 each ion was individually optimized by dft b3lyp 6 31g basis set method to ensure their correct electronic charge during the calculations becke 1992 hundred runs of conformer distribution calculations were performed on each of metal ion complexes in the presence of siderophore similar calculations were performed without siderophore and by using all ions and water this served as control the lowest energy stable conformations were selected and used as a starting geometry for the next step of complexation reactions likewise eight different siderophore and ions complexes were generated and used for the calculations the lowest energy stable complex from each complexation reactions was analyzed for hydrogen bonding and metal coordination interactions these complexes are positioned on the potential energy surface diagram with respect to their energy content 3 results and discussion 3 1 siderophore formation the isolate p taiwanensis r 12 2 is a gram negative short rod motile and non spore forming bacterium it was selected for siderophore production on the basis of its ability to produce an orange halo zone around the colony on the universal cas agar plate supplementary fig s1a and the formation of green colour pigment in msm a medium supplementary fig s1b siderophore scavenges selectively fe from the fe dye complex and releases fe from the dye as a result media colour changes from blue to green and orange halo zone around the colonies in the petriplates payne 1994 the siderophores produced by microorganisms are categorized by different types based on their principal chelating groups these are phenol catecholates hydroxamates carboxylates peptide based mycobactins citrate hydroxamates and keto hydroxy bidentates cornelis and matthijs 2002 winkelmann and drechsel 1997 initially siderophore formation was confirmed by cas assay and followed by the tetrazolium test the tetrazolium salt turned dark red after adding the siderophore suggesting that p taiwanensis r 12 2 synthesized the hydroxymate form of siderophore the linear and cyclic backbone configurations of the hydroxamate siderophores contain peptide chains in their core which is related to the form of pyoverdine siderophore pyoverdine however is a mixed kind of siderophore mostly produced by pseudomonas sp the pigment is yellowish green water soluble and has high ferric chelation ability holsberg and artis 1983 meyer 2000 in addition an intense peak was observed at 400 nm in cell free supernatant suggesting that pyoverdine type siderophore was secreted by p taiwanensis r 12 2 moreover presence of relative abundance of pyoverdine was measured by fluorescence excitation at 405 nm and emission at 450 nm which was functionally equivalent to an established method of pyoverdine abundance determination meyer and abdallah 1978 cox and adams 1985 visca et al 1992 supplementary data a high variability in redox potential of iron species helps in variety of biochemical reactions andrews et al 2003 iron under aerobic condition showed low solubility and high toxicity and it is found to exist as fe iii mineral or in different oxide hydroxide forms in the environment pierre et al 2002 and low solubility in this state microorganisms evolved number of strategies one of these is to solubilize fe iii mineral complex and make it bioavailable by secreting siderophore in the environment thus in iron limiting conditions most of the bacteria synthesize secondary metabolites siderophore into the medium and sequester the iron and utilize iron for its own metabolism duckworth et al 2009 3 2 media optimization for siderophore and struvite formation in order to increase siderophore production ability of p taiwanensis r 12 2 the media was designed by lowering the phosphate content to induce siderophore production with less ionic interference in standard sm medium meyer and abdallah 1978 four different combinations of msm table 1 were studied it was found that both the characteristics of simultaneous siderophore and struvite formation were demonstrated in msm a medium only while no struvite crystals were found in either of these controls at a low concentration this could be due to the fact that the ideal concentration of media ions necessary for the struvite production kofina and koutsoukos 2005 the standard sm was only used for the production of siderophores and not for struvite formation however in the present study it was observed that during media optimization p taiwanensis r 12 2 was able to simultaneously precipitate struvite in the medium along with the siderophore production in various iron free media such as mm9 schwyn and neilands 1987 cas amino acid medium meyer and abdallah 1978 barbhaiya and rao medium barbhaiya and rao 1985 and sm medium meyer and abdallah 1978 there were different species of pseudomonas and other bacterial genera were reported for siderophore synthesis while struvite formation has been studied separately in various media such as b 17 b 26 b 27 b 28 b 29 b 30 and b 411 rivadeneyra et al 1983 rivadeneyra et al 1992 by using different pseudomonas sp and other bacterial genera out of four different media msm a medium was found to be suitable candidate for both siderophore and struvite formation because it showed enhanced production of siderophore compared to msm b where the media components are at higher concentrations at low concentration of phosphate 1 3 mm in msm a bacterial growth and crystals of struvite were obtained after incubation for 24 h supplementary fig s2 however below this concentration of phosphate like msm c and msm d there was no synthesis of siderophore and struvite moreover there is no struvite crystallization occurred in two controls used the struvite formation was not observed in media devoid of siderophore and in water control having ph 9 0 signifies the role of siderophore in the struvite formation thus from these studies we reiterate that optimal concentration of phosphate is required for the bacterial growth and siderophore in this study we reports for the first time the formation of struvite at a low phosphate concentration 1 3 mm by inorganic media salts compared to the earlier reports where 1 63 mm of phosphate concentration was used from organic media like yeast extract sinha et al 2014 in the current investigation simultaneous siderophore synthesis and struvite formation were seen in the same medium msm a which has not been previously reported 3 3 in vitro struvite formation recovery of phosphate from industrial waste and electrochemical application it was observed that 99 of phosphate 4 0 mg was sequestered after each cycle of siderophore mediated struvite formation by using msm a media components the phosphate sequestration was performed for 20 cycles in the same siderophore solution after every cycle over 99 of phosphate was sequestered in to struvite crystals while about 0 5 to 1 of the phosphate remained after each cycle in the siderophore broth while in case of industrial waste sample the amount of phosphate present was 176 mg g of solid waste sample where more than 90 of phosphate was recovered from industrial phosphate rich waste sample compared to 40 recovery in control supplementary fig b1 in both these cases phosphate sequestration occurred within 10 to 20 minutes in control amorphous particles were observed with less quantity whereas fine crystalline nature of particles were observed with high quantity at the bottom of siderophore solution supplementary fig b1 asymmetrical curves can be seen in struvite cyclic voltammograms which can be attributed by the combined double layer and pseudo capacitive contributions to the overall capacitance supplementary fig b2a discharging times were found to be much longer than charging times with a small ir drop which was due to the higher capacitance values supplementary fig b2b the specific capacitance cs of the sample was estimated using the following equation c s i δ t m δ v where i current δt time of discharge m mass of active material 8 mg δv voltage drop upon discharging the specific capacitance value for the sample was found to be 320 f g 1 at 1 87 a g 1 96 f g 1 at 2 5 a g 1 23 4 f g 1 at 3 75 a g 1and 18 75 f g 1 at 5 a g 1 respectively we did not observe much capacitance different at higher applied current densities ca 3 75 5 a g 1 which attributed to the faster discharging profiles at higher applied current densities furthermore charge retention is an important parameter for the commercial application of any material consequently the cycling stability of struvite sample has been carried out at 2 a g 1 for 250 cycles specific capacitance and its coulombic efficiency retained was 92 even after 250 cycles which illustrates its good super capacitance behaviour for electrochemical applications supplementary fig b2 c d in the present study the siderophore produced is identified to be pyoverdine hydroxymate type of iron chelator pyoverdines are chemically composed of three parts a fluorescent chromophoric group dihydroquinoline b six to twelve different amino acid attached as peptide group and c various dicarboxylic acids or their amide derivative group attached to chromophoric group at n 3 position more than 60 different pyoverdines have been isolated and chemically identified from different pseudomonas species schalk and guillon 2013 however there are no reports till date on siderophore mediated struvite mineral formation siderophore is popularly known for its chelating ability for iron and different metal ions there is a possibility of chelation of media ions at particular concentration and further may act as a template for struvite nucleation dupraz and visscher 2005 the chemical groups in siderophore which are mostly negatively charged may interact with media ions like mg2 nh4 and po4 3 additionally the alkaline ph of siderophore solution favours the struvite crystallization and helps in enhancing the struvite formation sinha et al 2014 this interaction leads to crystal nucleation of ions to form struvite within 10 to 15 min of incubation at static condition this method of struvite formation is rapid compared to 7 days of incubation reported by sinha et al 2014 in vitro struvite crystallization was reported from different biological fluids like human urine ronteltap et al 2010 animal urine matsumoto and funaba 2008 bacterial extracellular products like proteins sinha et al 2014 extracellular polysaccharide lin et al 2012 glycosaminoglycan and glycoproteins like tamm horsfall glycoprotein mclean and nickel 1994 buffington et al 1994 and homopolypeptide li et al 2015 the struvite formation was found to occur in heterogeneous ion conditions by extracellular proteins or microbial cells li et al 2015 sinha et al 2014 in view of this background we propose the mechanism of siderophore mediated struvite crystallization supplementary fig s3 and we corroborate the struvite formation in medium may occur due to siderophore a number of studies suggests that parameters such as ph of the solution temperature presence of foreign ions and mg n p ratio influences the struvite precipitation and properties rahman et al 2014 kumar and pal 2015 li et al 2019 it was also reported that the precipitation is spontaneous at higher equimolar concentrations of mg n p ratio kofina and koutsoukos 2005 thus the 40 of struvite yield was obtained in control due to natural propensity of these three metal ions to agglomerate furthermore the presence of siderophore increases struvite yield possibly due to their high chelating action which may facilitate the fast precipitation of media ions into struvite the siderophore contains small peptide chain which may act as a template for the nucleation of ions and which further develops the struvite crystals dickerson et al 2008 the cavity like structure present in pyoverdine and the free oh cooh and nh groups surrounding ph ph 9 0 may be responsible for initiation of nucleation of media ions in order to eliminate the involvement of extracellular secreted proteins and glycoproteins for struvite nucleation the siderophore solution was sterilized the sterilized siderophore solution showed struvite formation which is in contrast to the involvement of bacterial secretory proteins in ion nucleation sinha et al 2014 the sterile siderophore was used multiple times for struvite formation by adjusting the ph to alkaline after 3 4 cycles of reuse without any decrease in potential of struvite formation thus an in vitro crystal growth of struvite biomineral in medium was induced by siderophore compared to earlier reports of bacterial struvite bio mineralization sinha et al 2014 in addition the struvite was subjected to electrochemical applications and it was found that the siderophore mediated struvite demonstrated high capacitance activity in future this research will help to open up new horizons for siderophore mediated struvite or struvite variant applications and explore more siderophore usability 3 4 structural and morphological investigation of struvite it is essential to know the exact chemical nature and composition of struvite crystals formed at low phosphate containing medium the struvite crystals were subjected to fesem edax pxrd ftir and tga analysis 3 4 1 fesem and edax spectroscopy analysis the morphological features of struvite crystals were recorded by fesem the variations in size of crystals were observed fig 1 a the sem images of the crystals at higher magnification showed typical prismatic crystal pattern bacterial metabolic activities may affect the crystal homogeneity because the bacterial cells synthesize different extracellular components e g secondary metabolite or enzymes etc in the medium the variation in size and shape of struvite might be due to different stages of crystal growth presence of impurities other ions and slight changes in ph during struvite synthesis mclean et al 1990 prywer and torzewska 2009 prywer et al 2012 the edax spectral pattern showed the presence of mg p n and o in the crystals and the elemental distribution confirms the struvite composition fig 1b 3 4 2 ftir and pxrd the major bands obtained in ftir spectra fig 2 a were in good agreement with previously reported band values for struvite sinha et al 2014 kurtulus and tas 2011 huang et al 2015 the characteristic band at 2879 cm 1 is due to the symmetric stretching vibration of n h in nh4 group a small broad band of water phosphate hydrogen bonding was observed at 2336 cm 1 while deformation of h o h mode of water and h n h mode of nh4 can be seen at 1663 and 1425 cm 1 respectively the bands at 752 and 678 cm 1 were assigned for water water hydrogen bonding although nh4 water hydrogen bonding can be seen at 881 cm 1 the different vibrational band frequencies of po4 3 groups were observed at 1167 977 562 467 and 433 cm 1 the h o h bending mode of vibration was observed at 1574 cm 1 thus ftir spectrum of struvite evidenced the presence of different functional constituents in the crystals like n h bond p o bond and nh4 and po4 3 ions these observed results can be correlated with previously reported struvite sinha et al 2014 the powder xrd pattern of struvite synthesized by siderophore is shown in fig 2b the values of diffraction pattern of the peaks obtained at 2θ displayed as consecutive increasing intensity from the 2θ range of 10 to 40 values such as 15 74 16 50 20 90 27 10 31 94 33 32 and 38 32 these obtained values correlated with hkl indices such as 002 011 111 103 004 022 213 of the struvite reported previously from the jcpds no 71 2089 huang et al 2015 the synthesised struvite from siderophore is reported to be monophasic in nature 3 4 3 tga profile of struvite the tga spectra fig 3 a showed that dehydration and decomposition of the struvite started at above 25 c whereas continuous weight loss of the product occurred from 70 c and complete loss at about 250 c and remained constant up to 1000 c this indicates that continuous removal of struvite elementary moieties occurs for e g h2o nh4 mg2 po4 3 etc at 140 c there was a 54 4 weight loss occurred which is attributed to liberation of water from the struvite crystals sinha et al 2014 the single peak around 125 7 c of dsc profile fig 3b showed that the major loss occurred during the heating process this single peak indicates the simultaneous loss of ammonia and water from struvite the endothermic heat flow was observed during the heat change as 131 87 kcal g sinha et al 2014 3 5 mechanism of struvite formation in order to find out the molecular mechanism of struvite formation by siderophore pyoverdine we validated the hypothesis by the computational approach prior to start of pyoverdine mediated metal complexation reactions the geometry of pyoverdine was optimized in presence of six h2o molecules using semi empirical pm6 method and its interactions with water molecules are depicted in figure 4 a the detail information on figure 4 is provided in supplementary information in this energetically 1090 062 kcal mol stable complex the water molecules interact with the hydroxyl groups of q chromophore hydroxyl ornithine d serine oh histidine and ad threonine table 2 these interactions were found to be common in all energetically stable pyoverdine ions complexes the metal complexation reaction was initiated by addition of mg2 ion in the pyoverdine water complex this yields higher 858 84 kcal mol energy for pyoverdine mg2 metal ion complex fig 4b which was stabilized by hexacoordinate bonds between mg2 with two water w2 w3 molecules and four amino acid residues in pyoverdine the carbonyl oxygen of hydroxyl ornithine and d threonine residues were involved in coordination bonds with mg2 along with hydroxyl oxygen and ring nitrogen of oh histidine the water molecules w1 w4 w5 w6 established the hydrogen bonding interactions with q chromophore oh histidine and coh ornithine fig 4b table 2 the common h bond interactions were found between water molecules and pyoverdine similar to figure 4a after the addition of po4 3 ion in the preceding complex it yields the pyo mg2 po4 3 the complex with the lowest 1463 642 kcal mol energy stable conformation depicted in figure 4c in this complex the mg2 was forming two coordination bonds with the oxygen of po4 3 ion the mg2 was also involved in coordination with carbonyl carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of coh ornithine q chromophore and oh histidine residues of pyoverdine respectively the po4 3 was forming hydrogen bonding interactions with coh ornithine and two water w2 w3 molecules table 2 the interactions between water molecules and pyoverdine residues q chromophore serine and lysine were found to be similar to preceding complexes table 2 in the presence of po4 3 the mg2 did not participate in a coordination bond with water molecules as compared to figure 4b the coh ornithine was involved in the stabilization of pyo mg2 po4 3 complex by establishing the coordinate as well as hydrogen bonding interactions with mg2 and po4 3 ions respectively these interactions might be helpful to produce the lowest energy stable complex fig 4c further the formation of struvite was accomplished by addition of nh4 ion in the earlier complex pyo mg2 po4 3 this resulted in slightly higher 1416 687 kcal mol energy complex fig 4d as compared to pyo mg2 po4 3 fig 4c thus herein we corroborated this result with previous study where ammonia plays an important role in struvite nucleation high ammonia concentration helps in the enhanced recovery of phosphorus compared to magnesium ion concentration present in the solution tansel et al 2018 in this pyo struvite complex the mg2 was involved in four coordination bonds with po4 3 q chromophore coh ornithine and oh histidine residues of pyoverdine table 2 similar to the earlier complex fig 4c the po4 3 was involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with coh ornithine and two water w2 w3 molecules the po4 3 was also forming two h bonds with nh4 during struvite formation two different types of interactions were observed i e one is coordinate bond between mg2 and po4 3 and other is hydrogen bond between po4 3 and nh4 fig 4d the pyoverdine holds the mg2 and po4 3 ions more tightly and the addition of nh4 leads to struvite formation once the struvite is formed its internal interactions binding profile may reduce the affinity towards the pyoverdine this may help pyoverdine to release the struvite and become easily accessible for the next cycle of struvite complexation reaction the second pathway was initiated by the addition of nh4 in earlier pyo mg2 complex fig 4b which again resulted in higher 674 856 kcal mol energy pyo mg2 nh4 complex fig 4c in this complex the mg2 was forming hexacoordinate bonds with two water w2 w3 molecules and three residues q chromophore d threonine and oh histidine of pyoverdine fig 4c table 2 the nh4 ion was positioned 4 5å away from the mg2 ion within the pyoverdine cavity where it interacts with d threonine coh ornithine and water w5 molecule the coh ornithine was also interacting with the other two water w1 w6 molecules the interaction network two coordinate and four hydrogen bonds was observed between two ions mg2 nh4 two water molecules w1 w6 and two pyoverdine residues d threonine and oh ornithine in pyo mg2 nh4 complex fig 4c this complex is energetically unstable as compared to the pyo mg2 complex but retains a similar binding pattern of mg2 with water molecules and pyoverdine residues figs 4b and 4c further the addition of po4 3 in the preceding complex leads to production of energetically favourable complex of struvite fig 4d in this stable complex the mg2 was forming five coordinate bonds with po4 3 q chromophore and three water w2 w3 w5 molecules table 2 the oxygen atoms of po4 3 were involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with water w1 w4 w5 w6 molecules nh4 ion q chromophore and d threonine residues of pyoverdine fig 4d the water w1 molecule was also involved in h bond with d serine and nh4 ion in this complex the nh4 was positioned in the middle of pyoverdine cavity formed by q chromophore oh histidine d serine and ad threonine residues while water molecules interacted with struvite complex through coordinate and h bonds interactions the struvite complex fig 4d contains one coordinate bond between mg2 and po4 3 ions and two h bonds between po4 3 and nh4 ions similar to struvite complex formed in the earlier pathway fig 4d therefore the pyo struvite complexes produced by two complexation reaction pathways fig 4 possesses similar energy content and same internal interactions pattern suggests that struvite formation could occur through different pyoverdine mediated pathways based on sequential addition of ions moreover to understand the role of pyoverdine in struvite formation we have performed conformer distribution calculations in the absence and presence addition of all ions at a time of pyoverdine figs 4a and 4d in the absence of pyoverdine water control the obtained struvite complex has higher 667 272 kcal mol energy content as compared to earlier formed struvite complexes figs 4d 4d in this complex fig 4a the mg2 was involved in four coordinate bonds with po4 3 and water w2 w3 molecules the po4 3 was also forming hydrogen bonding interactions with five water molecules and nh4 ion fig 4a two coordinate bonds between mg2 and po4 3 and one h bond between po4 3 and nh4 ions were observed in struvite complex which were produced in absence of pyoverdine fig 4a whereas one coordinate bond between mg2 and po4 3 and two h bonds between po4 3 and nh4 ions were noticed in struvite complex which were produced in presence of pyoverdine figs 4d 4d furthermore we have performed conformer distribution calculations on pyoverdine where all mg2 po4 3 and nh4 ions were added in a single step the resulting lowest 1425 162 kcal mol energy stable complex has similar interactions and location of struvite within the cavity of pyoverdine that observed in struvite complex produced in the presence of pyoverdine figs 4d and 4d the pyoverdine mediated all struvite complexes figs 4d 4d and 4d are energetically more stable than produced in absence of pyoverdine fig 4a which could be explained by coordinate and hydrogen bonding interactions between the complexes the interactions of water molecules with struvite and pyoverdine residues were significantly contributed to the proper positioning of struvite within the cavity of pyoverdine the first pathway pyo 6h2o mg2 po4 3 nh4 is energetically stable as compared to second pathway pyo 6h2o mg2 nh4 po4 3 therefore first pathway of complexation reaction could be more favourable for the formation of struvite nonetheless li et al 2015 used a peptide model in previous study to demonstrate in vitro struvite biomineralization in solution for e g polyaspartic acid pasp as urinary protein for studies of interaction between protein and mineral formation they suggested that pasp interacts with the ions in solution by its chelating action to form stable complexes as a result the activity of free metal ions decreased to limit crystal growth wang et al 2009 wu and grant 2002 numerous studies have shown that the presence of special acidic proteins or macromolecular matrices plays an important role in the nucleation of metal ions on the surface of the macromolecule in the biomineralization process of different mineral formation addadi et al 1987 addadi and weiner 1985 weiner 1979 2008 from the theoretical studies we concluded that magnesium ammonium and phosphate ions with water have 667 272 kcal mol of energy indicating very unstable complex whereas in presence of pyoverdine it showed very stable complex with the energy of 1416 687 kcal mol this shows that siderophore plays an important role in struvite formation by trapping the phosphate ions 4 conclusions in this study the phosphate removal strategies from the industrial sample are discussed which can help to solve the problem of phosphate contamination in water siderophore mediated sequestration of phosphate ions in the form of struvite is reported this method was feasible in low phosphate concentration and also has high reusability potential the process of in vitro struvite formation was very rapid and required very less time for the formation we also hypothesized possible mechanism of siderophore induced phosphorus mineralization into struvite for the first time we demonstrated the formation of struvite from solid industrial waste and its application in supercapacitor siderophore mediated struvite formation and its application in agriculture can be further explored similarly the modified struvite with different electrochemically active cations like ni co zn cd te sn pt etc can be prepared by using siderophore and may be used

16697,efficient and sustainable removal of phosphate ions from an aqueous solution is of great challenge herein we demonstrated a greener route for phosphate recovery through struvite formation by using bacterial siderophore this method was efficient for removal of phosphate as low as 1 3 mm with 99 recovery efficiency the siderophore produced by pseudomonas taiwanensis r 12 2 act as template for the nucleation of struvite crystals and was found sustainable for recycling the phosphorous efficiently after twenty cycles the formation of struvite crystals is driven by surrounding ph 9 0 and presence of mg2 and nh4 ions along with po4 3 and siderophore which was further validated by computational studies the morphology of struvite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy followed by elemental analysis furthermore our results revealed that the siderophore plays an important role in struvite biomineralization we have successfully demonstrated the phosphate sequestration by using industrial waste samples as possible application for environmental sustainability and phosphate conservation for the first time electrochemical super capacitance performance of the struvite was studied the specific capacitance value for the struvite was found to be 320 f g 1 at 1 87 a g 1 and retained 92 capacitance after 250 cycles the study revealed the potential implications of siderophore for the phosphate recycling and the new mechanism for biomineralization by sequestering into struvite graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords siderophore struvite computational phosphorus recovery super capacitance 1 introduction microorganisms play an important role in the biosphere through their diversified metabolic activities and performs flexible functions under different conditions biologically induced mineralization leads to the formation of minerals of different elements like ca mo zn cu ni and co lowenstam 1981 and finally contributes to the biogeochemical cycles metal speciation occurs due to microbial mediated mobilization and immobilization which is a complex and interdisciplinary process contributes to the biomineralization gadd 2001 2004 in all the biochemical processes phosphorus has major role and is well known for its importance in dna chemistry phosphorus is the most important macro element in the entire biosphere next to the nitrogen needed for the biological processes due to mining the phosphorus reservoirs have been depleted to meet the global demands of phosphate fertilizers gilbert 2009 an efficient method for phosphate recovery can help to solve this problem there are several ways to removes the phosphorus from the environment such as struvite precipitation from wastewater treatment drainages and wastewater lagoons le corre et al 2009 this is one of the proven methodologies to be used for the recovery of phosphorus from the wastewater effluents where the phosphate concentration is high le corre et al 2009 struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate hexa hydrate mgnh4po4 6h2o is one of the best fertilizers that provides three important macro elements such as n p and mg in a single unique combination struvite is a kind of slow fertilizer releaser gull and pasek 2013 because of its poor water solubility and it can be stored in the soil for longer periods for the release of macroelements slowly from the fertilizer lee et al 2009 phosphate recovery in the form of struvite crystals from wastewater treatment plant or livestock waste is of major concern it needs to be carried out by controlling the ph by alkali dosing and co2 stripping which increases the cost of struvite production and also hampers the reaction rate of the struvite formation le corre et al 2009 the ca2 k and other ions present in the waste samples also interfere and easily get introduced and co precipitated with struvite which leads to the formation of struvite variants hao et al 2008 the rapid precipitation may cause the formation of smaller particle size as a result it reduces the potentials of crystal growth and also increase the cost of the process for large scales hao et al 2013 mayer et al 2016 pastor et al 2010 struvite crystallization occurs naturally in the diverse biological ecosystems biochemical and physiological changes occur in these environments are through microbial metabolism that induces the combination of ions such as ammonia phosphate and magnesium rivadeneyra et al 1983 there are number of different environments studied for the struvite crystallization especially from anaerobic digester maqueda et al 1994 pastor et al 2010 waste of animal farming liquid huang et al 2015 and municipal treatment plants le corre et al 2009 parsons and smith 2008 another approach used for struvite crystallization was using urine and synthetic urine of humans as well as animals as a source of phosphorus ronteltap et al 2010 chemically synthesized struvite could also be obtained by mixing the equimolar concentrations of ammonia phosphorus and magnesium salts kurtulus and tas 2011 microbial activities in various ecosystems plays a key role in the formation of various minerals including struvite frankel and bazylinski 2003 gadd 2010 there are number of microbial isolates viz trypanosoma cruzi adroher et al 1988 arthrobacter sp pseudomonas sp pérez garcía et al 1990 proteus mirabilis prywer and torzewska 2010 myxococcus sp omar et al 1998 enterobacter sp emb19 sinha et al 2014 and acinetobacter calcoaceticus srb4 han et al 2015 reported in the lab scale studies for struvite biomineralization microorganisms synthesizes low molecular weight ferric ion specific chelating agents known as siderophores under iron starvation conditions these siderophores are released for acquisition of iron after binding to iron molecule it transports back to organism via high affinity and receptor dependent transport system the regulation of the production of siderophores depends on the availability of iron crosa and walsh 2002 there are three major functions of siderophore as a trojan horse strategy for drug delivery plant growth promotion controlling the noxious species in the soil and for solubilization and mobilization of wide range of metal ions 2011 moll et al 2008 schalk et al 2011 a bacterium pseudomonas taiwanensis was initially isolated as a novel bacterial species from the soil by wang et al 2010 and it was reported for its ability to produce siderophores chen et al 2016 thus we used the isolated strain of this bacterium in the present study because of its potential to produce siderophores and to understand extracellular process of the bacterial mediated struvite formation the in vitro formation of struvite by a cell free supernatant and the possible role of bacterial secretory products in the nucleation of media ions was suggested by sinha et al 2014 following this hypothesis of an extracellular mechanism for struvite formation we first investigated the involvement of the bacterial pigment i e siderophore produced from new isolate pseudomonas taiwanensis r 12 2 in struvite crystallization to the best of our knowledge there are no reports on struvite formation from siderophores till date in addition we plan to use it for the crystallization of struvite from phosphate rich industrial waste sample moreover in the past few years mesoporous materials like struvite has been advocated for the supercapacitor applications due to its higher internal areas enabling formation of large number of double layers shiraishi 2003 because of its porous nature it allows rapid electrolyte transfer which results in the charge transfer many transitional metal based composite materials have been tried due to their property of variable oxidation states however less attention was paid towards non transitional phosphate based minerals to be used for the supercapacitor applications rashidi et al 2020 herein we have successfully synthesized the struvite materials using the novel biological route due to multi ions system it provides unique possibility to hold the charge which is an important requirement of the materials for the application in supercapacitor these properties motivated us to study its electrochemical parameter for the supercapacitor 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial strain in our previous study p taiwanensis r 12 2 has been isolated from the tannery soil sample nandre et al 2017 and used for siderophore production and struvite formation in the present study the culture has been deposited in national centre for microbial resource ncmr pune india with accession number pseudomonas taiwanensis mcc 4695 the culture was routinely maintained at 4 c on 0 1 x tryptic soya agar the glycerol stocks 40 were also prepared and maintained at 40 c 2 2 screening of siderophore production and characterization the ability of p taiwanensis r 12 2 to synthesize the siderophore was tested on standard universal chrome azurol sulphonate cas agar plate by spot inoculation the universal cas plate was prepared as reported previously schwyn and neilands 1987 the cas plate was incubated at 30 c for 48 h to check for the formation of orange halo zone around the colony the siderophore production was carried out by growing p taiwanensis r 12 2 in standard succinate broth medium sm meyer and abdallah 1978 after 48 h incubation the media was centrifuged at 8000 g at 4 c and the cell free supernatant was examined for formation of siderophore types by using different chemical tests such as tetrazolium test snow 1954 arnow s test arnow 1937 and carboxylate test vogel 1992 supplementary data a the produced siderophore was diluted in 100 mm tris hcl ph 7 0 and qualitatively analysed by fluorescence spectra jasco fp 8300 japan in the range of 350 to 500 nm wavelength by uv visible absorption spectra baysse et al 2000 2 3 media optimization for siderophore the siderophore production ability of the p taiwanensis r 12 2 was evaluated by growing it initially in standard sm broth meyer and abdallah 1978 composed of g l succinate 4 0 nh4cl 1 0 k2hpo4 3 0 kh2po4 6 0 and mgso4 7h2o 0 2 and ph 7 0 four different combinations of modified succinate broth medium msm were prepared to observe simultaneous formation of siderophore and struvite table 1 all the media components were dissolved in milli q water the p taiwanensis r 12 2 was inoculated 0 05 48 h grown culture in respective sterilized msm mediums in order to increase the production of siderophore 0 05 sterilized deferrated tryptone 3 stock broth was added and flasks were incubated at 30 c with 150 rpm shaking for 48 h the intense greenish yellow fluorescent coloration of the media was observed as an indicator for the production of siderophore 2 4 in vitro struvite formation by siderophore out of four different msm broths table 1 msm a was selected for both siderophore production as well as in vitro struvite formation the media msm a deferrated without fe was used as test and msm a ferrated with 50 µm fe as a biotic control both the flasks were inoculated with p taiwanensis r 12 2 all the flasks were incubated at 30 c for 48 h at 150 rpm the ph of the test flask reached to ph 9 0 after siderophore production from the initial ph 7 0 whereas in biotic control the ph ranged between ph 7 0 8 0 after the growth the flasks were centrifuged at 4 c at 6000 g for 20 min to collect the supernatant the supernatant of test biotic and abiotic control sterilized milli q were adjusted to ph 9 0 biotic and abiotic control served as siderophore free controls which were further used to check for struvite crystallization all the flasks were autoclaved at 15 lbs pressure for 30 min cooled and centrifuged to eliminate any role of proteins in the struvite formation the supernatnats were collected in different separating funnels all the media components of msm a g were added into the respective separating funnels and mixed thoroughly and kept at static condition the precipitate formation was started after 5 min in the test funnel and it is settled down at the bottom of funnel within 10 15 min whereas there was no precipitation observed in the control flasks after 15 min the amount of phosphate was estimated from supernatant by fiske subbarow method fiske and subbarow 1925 the settled precipitate from test flask was collected by filtration washed for 3 4 times with milli q water and dried at 50 c for 12 h after drying the crystals were further characterized and analyzed the above procedure of struvite formation was repeated for twenty times and the phosphate concentration was estimated before and after every cycles the amount of phosphate sequestration phosphate recovery by siderophore was determined 2 5 recovery of phosphate from industrial solid p rich waste sample by using siderophore and its electrochemical applications to study the application of siderophore based in vitro struvite formation on real waste samples we have collected the solid waste sample from phosphate fertilizer industry situated near ranjangaon industrial area pune india in order to precipitate phosphate in the form of struvite industrial solid p rich waste sample 1 0g was dissolved in 100 ml sterilized siderophore solution and 0 25 g of nh4cl and 0 09 g of mgso4 7h2o were added after 15 min the precipitate was collected and characterized while the supernatant was analyzed for phosphate content by fiske subbarow method fiske and subbarow 1925 the abiotic control water was adjusted to ph 9 0 and performed the same above experiment all the experiments were performed in triplicate the electrochemical properties of the formed struvite from industrial waste sample were characterized by a conventional three electrode system in 2 m koh electrolyte at 25 c the struvite 8 0 mg active material along with 1 5 mg of activated carbon and 0 5 mg of polyvinylidene fluoride binder were mixed in n methyl 2 pyrrolidene and sonicated to prepare the ink typical working electrode was prepared by drop casting 1 0 mg of ink on the carbon electrode 1 0 1 0 cm2 platinum foil was used as a counter electrode and hg hgo as a reference electrode to perform cyclic voltammetric studies the potential window of 0 1 0 v was used at different scan rates the galvanostatic charge discharge tests were carried out in the potential range of 0 0 8 v at different current densities 1 87 2 5 3 75 and 5 a g 1 2 6 characterization of struvite crystals the produced struvite crystals were analysed for their morphological characteristics and elemental composition by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem fei nova nanosem 450 equipped with energy dispersive x ray edax spectroscopy bruker xflash 6 30 the x ray powder diffraction pxrd pattern of struvite crystals were characterized by using an ultima iv diffractometer rigaku japan over the 2θ range of 10 80 degrees the sample was prepared as per the standard procedure and the measurements were carried out with the help of goniometer using cukα radiation kα 0 1540562 nm monochromatized with a graphite crystal the produced struvite was confirmed by comparing values with the standard jcpds card number 71 2086 further the ftir spectra of dried powder of struvite crystals were recorded in the scanning range of 400 4000 cm 1 on tensor 37 ftir bruker using kbr struvite crystals of 6 0 mg were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis tga at a atmospheric pressure dta 60h shimadzu thermal gradation was increased at the rate of 10 c per min from 10 1000 c and differential scanning calorimetry dsc dsc 60 shimadzu was performed in the range of 10 300 c at the same conditions 2 7 mechanism of struvite formation by siderophore a computational approach in order to understand the mechanism of siderophore mediated struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o formation further analyzed conformer distribution calculations on different metal ions complexes from our experimental results we predicted two different pathways of struvite formation based on the alteration in the sequence of addition of ions into the siderophore containing media the first pathway is siderophore 6h2o mg2 po4 3 nh4 and the second pathway is siderophore 6h2o mg2 nh4 po4 3 these pathways are distinct from each other due to change in the sequential addition of nh4 and po4 3 ions during the complexation reactions the amino acid sequence of siderophore has been adopted from the previous study chen et al 2016 the initial structure of siderophore was constructed and geometrically optimized by semi empirical pm6 method using spartan 14 molecular modeling software shao et al 2006 each ion was individually optimized by dft b3lyp 6 31g basis set method to ensure their correct electronic charge during the calculations becke 1992 hundred runs of conformer distribution calculations were performed on each of metal ion complexes in the presence of siderophore similar calculations were performed without siderophore and by using all ions and water this served as control the lowest energy stable conformations were selected and used as a starting geometry for the next step of complexation reactions likewise eight different siderophore and ions complexes were generated and used for the calculations the lowest energy stable complex from each complexation reactions was analyzed for hydrogen bonding and metal coordination interactions these complexes are positioned on the potential energy surface diagram with respect to their energy content 3 results and discussion 3 1 siderophore formation the isolate p taiwanensis r 12 2 is a gram negative short rod motile and non spore forming bacterium it was selected for siderophore production on the basis of its ability to produce an orange halo zone around the colony on the universal cas agar plate supplementary fig s1a and the formation of green colour pigment in msm a medium supplementary fig s1b siderophore scavenges selectively fe from the fe dye complex and releases fe from the dye as a result media colour changes from blue to green and orange halo zone around the colonies in the petriplates payne 1994 the siderophores produced by microorganisms are categorized by different types based on their principal chelating groups these are phenol catecholates hydroxamates carboxylates peptide based mycobactins citrate hydroxamates and keto hydroxy bidentates cornelis and matthijs 2002 winkelmann and drechsel 1997 initially siderophore formation was confirmed by cas assay and followed by the tetrazolium test the tetrazolium salt turned dark red after adding the siderophore suggesting that p taiwanensis r 12 2 synthesized the hydroxymate form of siderophore the linear and cyclic backbone configurations of the hydroxamate siderophores contain peptide chains in their core which is related to the form of pyoverdine siderophore pyoverdine however is a mixed kind of siderophore mostly produced by pseudomonas sp the pigment is yellowish green water soluble and has high ferric chelation ability holsberg and artis 1983 meyer 2000 in addition an intense peak was observed at 400 nm in cell free supernatant suggesting that pyoverdine type siderophore was secreted by p taiwanensis r 12 2 moreover presence of relative abundance of pyoverdine was measured by fluorescence excitation at 405 nm and emission at 450 nm which was functionally equivalent to an established method of pyoverdine abundance determination meyer and abdallah 1978 cox and adams 1985 visca et al 1992 supplementary data a high variability in redox potential of iron species helps in variety of biochemical reactions andrews et al 2003 iron under aerobic condition showed low solubility and high toxicity and it is found to exist as fe iii mineral or in different oxide hydroxide forms in the environment pierre et al 2002 and low solubility in this state microorganisms evolved number of strategies one of these is to solubilize fe iii mineral complex and make it bioavailable by secreting siderophore in the environment thus in iron limiting conditions most of the bacteria synthesize secondary metabolites siderophore into the medium and sequester the iron and utilize iron for its own metabolism duckworth et al 2009 3 2 media optimization for siderophore and struvite formation in order to increase siderophore production ability of p taiwanensis r 12 2 the media was designed by lowering the phosphate content to induce siderophore production with less ionic interference in standard sm medium meyer and abdallah 1978 four different combinations of msm table 1 were studied it was found that both the characteristics of simultaneous siderophore and struvite formation were demonstrated in msm a medium only while no struvite crystals were found in either of these controls at a low concentration this could be due to the fact that the ideal concentration of media ions necessary for the struvite production kofina and koutsoukos 2005 the standard sm was only used for the production of siderophores and not for struvite formation however in the present study it was observed that during media optimization p taiwanensis r 12 2 was able to simultaneously precipitate struvite in the medium along with the siderophore production in various iron free media such as mm9 schwyn and neilands 1987 cas amino acid medium meyer and abdallah 1978 barbhaiya and rao medium barbhaiya and rao 1985 and sm medium meyer and abdallah 1978 there were different species of pseudomonas and other bacterial genera were reported for siderophore synthesis while struvite formation has been studied separately in various media such as b 17 b 26 b 27 b 28 b 29 b 30 and b 411 rivadeneyra et al 1983 rivadeneyra et al 1992 by using different pseudomonas sp and other bacterial genera out of four different media msm a medium was found to be suitable candidate for both siderophore and struvite formation because it showed enhanced production of siderophore compared to msm b where the media components are at higher concentrations at low concentration of phosphate 1 3 mm in msm a bacterial growth and crystals of struvite were obtained after incubation for 24 h supplementary fig s2 however below this concentration of phosphate like msm c and msm d there was no synthesis of siderophore and struvite moreover there is no struvite crystallization occurred in two controls used the struvite formation was not observed in media devoid of siderophore and in water control having ph 9 0 signifies the role of siderophore in the struvite formation thus from these studies we reiterate that optimal concentration of phosphate is required for the bacterial growth and siderophore in this study we reports for the first time the formation of struvite at a low phosphate concentration 1 3 mm by inorganic media salts compared to the earlier reports where 1 63 mm of phosphate concentration was used from organic media like yeast extract sinha et al 2014 in the current investigation simultaneous siderophore synthesis and struvite formation were seen in the same medium msm a which has not been previously reported 3 3 in vitro struvite formation recovery of phosphate from industrial waste and electrochemical application it was observed that 99 of phosphate 4 0 mg was sequestered after each cycle of siderophore mediated struvite formation by using msm a media components the phosphate sequestration was performed for 20 cycles in the same siderophore solution after every cycle over 99 of phosphate was sequestered in to struvite crystals while about 0 5 to 1 of the phosphate remained after each cycle in the siderophore broth while in case of industrial waste sample the amount of phosphate present was 176 mg g of solid waste sample where more than 90 of phosphate was recovered from industrial phosphate rich waste sample compared to 40 recovery in control supplementary fig b1 in both these cases phosphate sequestration occurred within 10 to 20 minutes in control amorphous particles were observed with less quantity whereas fine crystalline nature of particles were observed with high quantity at the bottom of siderophore solution supplementary fig b1 asymmetrical curves can be seen in struvite cyclic voltammograms which can be attributed by the combined double layer and pseudo capacitive contributions to the overall capacitance supplementary fig b2a discharging times were found to be much longer than charging times with a small ir drop which was due to the higher capacitance values supplementary fig b2b the specific capacitance cs of the sample was estimated using the following equation c s i δ t m δ v where i current δt time of discharge m mass of active material 8 mg δv voltage drop upon discharging the specific capacitance value for the sample was found to be 320 f g 1 at 1 87 a g 1 96 f g 1 at 2 5 a g 1 23 4 f g 1 at 3 75 a g 1and 18 75 f g 1 at 5 a g 1 respectively we did not observe much capacitance different at higher applied current densities ca 3 75 5 a g 1 which attributed to the faster discharging profiles at higher applied current densities furthermore charge retention is an important parameter for the commercial application of any material consequently the cycling stability of struvite sample has been carried out at 2 a g 1 for 250 cycles specific capacitance and its coulombic efficiency retained was 92 even after 250 cycles which illustrates its good super capacitance behaviour for electrochemical applications supplementary fig b2 c d in the present study the siderophore produced is identified to be pyoverdine hydroxymate type of iron chelator pyoverdines are chemically composed of three parts a fluorescent chromophoric group dihydroquinoline b six to twelve different amino acid attached as peptide group and c various dicarboxylic acids or their amide derivative group attached to chromophoric group at n 3 position more than 60 different pyoverdines have been isolated and chemically identified from different pseudomonas species schalk and guillon 2013 however there are no reports till date on siderophore mediated struvite mineral formation siderophore is popularly known for its chelating ability for iron and different metal ions there is a possibility of chelation of media ions at particular concentration and further may act as a template for struvite nucleation dupraz and visscher 2005 the chemical groups in siderophore which are mostly negatively charged may interact with media ions like mg2 nh4 and po4 3 additionally the alkaline ph of siderophore solution favours the struvite crystallization and helps in enhancing the struvite formation sinha et al 2014 this interaction leads to crystal nucleation of ions to form struvite within 10 to 15 min of incubation at static condition this method of struvite formation is rapid compared to 7 days of incubation reported by sinha et al 2014 in vitro struvite crystallization was reported from different biological fluids like human urine ronteltap et al 2010 animal urine matsumoto and funaba 2008 bacterial extracellular products like proteins sinha et al 2014 extracellular polysaccharide lin et al 2012 glycosaminoglycan and glycoproteins like tamm horsfall glycoprotein mclean and nickel 1994 buffington et al 1994 and homopolypeptide li et al 2015 the struvite formation was found to occur in heterogeneous ion conditions by extracellular proteins or microbial cells li et al 2015 sinha et al 2014 in view of this background we propose the mechanism of siderophore mediated struvite crystallization supplementary fig s3 and we corroborate the struvite formation in medium may occur due to siderophore a number of studies suggests that parameters such as ph of the solution temperature presence of foreign ions and mg n p ratio influences the struvite precipitation and properties rahman et al 2014 kumar and pal 2015 li et al 2019 it was also reported that the precipitation is spontaneous at higher equimolar concentrations of mg n p ratio kofina and koutsoukos 2005 thus the 40 of struvite yield was obtained in control due to natural propensity of these three metal ions to agglomerate furthermore the presence of siderophore increases struvite yield possibly due to their high chelating action which may facilitate the fast precipitation of media ions into struvite the siderophore contains small peptide chain which may act as a template for the nucleation of ions and which further develops the struvite crystals dickerson et al 2008 the cavity like structure present in pyoverdine and the free oh cooh and nh groups surrounding ph ph 9 0 may be responsible for initiation of nucleation of media ions in order to eliminate the involvement of extracellular secreted proteins and glycoproteins for struvite nucleation the siderophore solution was sterilized the sterilized siderophore solution showed struvite formation which is in contrast to the involvement of bacterial secretory proteins in ion nucleation sinha et al 2014 the sterile siderophore was used multiple times for struvite formation by adjusting the ph to alkaline after 3 4 cycles of reuse without any decrease in potential of struvite formation thus an in vitro crystal growth of struvite biomineral in medium was induced by siderophore compared to earlier reports of bacterial struvite bio mineralization sinha et al 2014 in addition the struvite was subjected to electrochemical applications and it was found that the siderophore mediated struvite demonstrated high capacitance activity in future this research will help to open up new horizons for siderophore mediated struvite or struvite variant applications and explore more siderophore usability 3 4 structural and morphological investigation of struvite it is essential to know the exact chemical nature and composition of struvite crystals formed at low phosphate containing medium the struvite crystals were subjected to fesem edax pxrd ftir and tga analysis 3 4 1 fesem and edax spectroscopy analysis the morphological features of struvite crystals were recorded by fesem the variations in size of crystals were observed fig 1 a the sem images of the crystals at higher magnification showed typical prismatic crystal pattern bacterial metabolic activities may affect the crystal homogeneity because the bacterial cells synthesize different extracellular components e g secondary metabolite or enzymes etc in the medium the variation in size and shape of struvite might be due to different stages of crystal growth presence of impurities other ions and slight changes in ph during struvite synthesis mclean et al 1990 prywer and torzewska 2009 prywer et al 2012 the edax spectral pattern showed the presence of mg p n and o in the crystals and the elemental distribution confirms the struvite composition fig 1b 3 4 2 ftir and pxrd the major bands obtained in ftir spectra fig 2 a were in good agreement with previously reported band values for struvite sinha et al 2014 kurtulus and tas 2011 huang et al 2015 the characteristic band at 2879 cm 1 is due to the symmetric stretching vibration of n h in nh4 group a small broad band of water phosphate hydrogen bonding was observed at 2336 cm 1 while deformation of h o h mode of water and h n h mode of nh4 can be seen at 1663 and 1425 cm 1 respectively the bands at 752 and 678 cm 1 were assigned for water water hydrogen bonding although nh4 water hydrogen bonding can be seen at 881 cm 1 the different vibrational band frequencies of po4 3 groups were observed at 1167 977 562 467 and 433 cm 1 the h o h bending mode of vibration was observed at 1574 cm 1 thus ftir spectrum of struvite evidenced the presence of different functional constituents in the crystals like n h bond p o bond and nh4 and po4 3 ions these observed results can be correlated with previously reported struvite sinha et al 2014 the powder xrd pattern of struvite synthesized by siderophore is shown in fig 2b the values of diffraction pattern of the peaks obtained at 2θ displayed as consecutive increasing intensity from the 2θ range of 10 to 40 values such as 15 74 16 50 20 90 27 10 31 94 33 32 and 38 32 these obtained values correlated with hkl indices such as 002 011 111 103 004 022 213 of the struvite reported previously from the jcpds no 71 2089 huang et al 2015 the synthesised struvite from siderophore is reported to be monophasic in nature 3 4 3 tga profile of struvite the tga spectra fig 3 a showed that dehydration and decomposition of the struvite started at above 25 c whereas continuous weight loss of the product occurred from 70 c and complete loss at about 250 c and remained constant up to 1000 c this indicates that continuous removal of struvite elementary moieties occurs for e g h2o nh4 mg2 po4 3 etc at 140 c there was a 54 4 weight loss occurred which is attributed to liberation of water from the struvite crystals sinha et al 2014 the single peak around 125 7 c of dsc profile fig 3b showed that the major loss occurred during the heating process this single peak indicates the simultaneous loss of ammonia and water from struvite the endothermic heat flow was observed during the heat change as 131 87 kcal g sinha et al 2014 3 5 mechanism of struvite formation in order to find out the molecular mechanism of struvite formation by siderophore pyoverdine we validated the hypothesis by the computational approach prior to start of pyoverdine mediated metal complexation reactions the geometry of pyoverdine was optimized in presence of six h2o molecules using semi empirical pm6 method and its interactions with water molecules are depicted in figure 4 a the detail information on figure 4 is provided in supplementary information in this energetically 1090 062 kcal mol stable complex the water molecules interact with the hydroxyl groups of q chromophore hydroxyl ornithine d serine oh histidine and ad threonine table 2 these interactions were found to be common in all energetically stable pyoverdine ions complexes the metal complexation reaction was initiated by addition of mg2 ion in the pyoverdine water complex this yields higher 858 84 kcal mol energy for pyoverdine mg2 metal ion complex fig 4b which was stabilized by hexacoordinate bonds between mg2 with two water w2 w3 molecules and four amino acid residues in pyoverdine the carbonyl oxygen of hydroxyl ornithine and d threonine residues were involved in coordination bonds with mg2 along with hydroxyl oxygen and ring nitrogen of oh histidine the water molecules w1 w4 w5 w6 established the hydrogen bonding interactions with q chromophore oh histidine and coh ornithine fig 4b table 2 the common h bond interactions were found between water molecules and pyoverdine similar to figure 4a after the addition of po4 3 ion in the preceding complex it yields the pyo mg2 po4 3 the complex with the lowest 1463 642 kcal mol energy stable conformation depicted in figure 4c in this complex the mg2 was forming two coordination bonds with the oxygen of po4 3 ion the mg2 was also involved in coordination with carbonyl carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of coh ornithine q chromophore and oh histidine residues of pyoverdine respectively the po4 3 was forming hydrogen bonding interactions with coh ornithine and two water w2 w3 molecules table 2 the interactions between water molecules and pyoverdine residues q chromophore serine and lysine were found to be similar to preceding complexes table 2 in the presence of po4 3 the mg2 did not participate in a coordination bond with water molecules as compared to figure 4b the coh ornithine was involved in the stabilization of pyo mg2 po4 3 complex by establishing the coordinate as well as hydrogen bonding interactions with mg2 and po4 3 ions respectively these interactions might be helpful to produce the lowest energy stable complex fig 4c further the formation of struvite was accomplished by addition of nh4 ion in the earlier complex pyo mg2 po4 3 this resulted in slightly higher 1416 687 kcal mol energy complex fig 4d as compared to pyo mg2 po4 3 fig 4c thus herein we corroborated this result with previous study where ammonia plays an important role in struvite nucleation high ammonia concentration helps in the enhanced recovery of phosphorus compared to magnesium ion concentration present in the solution tansel et al 2018 in this pyo struvite complex the mg2 was involved in four coordination bonds with po4 3 q chromophore coh ornithine and oh histidine residues of pyoverdine table 2 similar to the earlier complex fig 4c the po4 3 was involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with coh ornithine and two water w2 w3 molecules the po4 3 was also forming two h bonds with nh4 during struvite formation two different types of interactions were observed i e one is coordinate bond between mg2 and po4 3 and other is hydrogen bond between po4 3 and nh4 fig 4d the pyoverdine holds the mg2 and po4 3 ions more tightly and the addition of nh4 leads to struvite formation once the struvite is formed its internal interactions binding profile may reduce the affinity towards the pyoverdine this may help pyoverdine to release the struvite and become easily accessible for the next cycle of struvite complexation reaction the second pathway was initiated by the addition of nh4 in earlier pyo mg2 complex fig 4b which again resulted in higher 674 856 kcal mol energy pyo mg2 nh4 complex fig 4c in this complex the mg2 was forming hexacoordinate bonds with two water w2 w3 molecules and three residues q chromophore d threonine and oh histidine of pyoverdine fig 4c table 2 the nh4 ion was positioned 4 5å away from the mg2 ion within the pyoverdine cavity where it interacts with d threonine coh ornithine and water w5 molecule the coh ornithine was also interacting with the other two water w1 w6 molecules the interaction network two coordinate and four hydrogen bonds was observed between two ions mg2 nh4 two water molecules w1 w6 and two pyoverdine residues d threonine and oh ornithine in pyo mg2 nh4 complex fig 4c this complex is energetically unstable as compared to the pyo mg2 complex but retains a similar binding pattern of mg2 with water molecules and pyoverdine residues figs 4b and 4c further the addition of po4 3 in the preceding complex leads to production of energetically favourable complex of struvite fig 4d in this stable complex the mg2 was forming five coordinate bonds with po4 3 q chromophore and three water w2 w3 w5 molecules table 2 the oxygen atoms of po4 3 were involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with water w1 w4 w5 w6 molecules nh4 ion q chromophore and d threonine residues of pyoverdine fig 4d the water w1 molecule was also involved in h bond with d serine and nh4 ion in this complex the nh4 was positioned in the middle of pyoverdine cavity formed by q chromophore oh histidine d serine and ad threonine residues while water molecules interacted with struvite complex through coordinate and h bonds interactions the struvite complex fig 4d contains one coordinate bond between mg2 and po4 3 ions and two h bonds between po4 3 and nh4 ions similar to struvite complex formed in the earlier pathway fig 4d therefore the pyo struvite complexes produced by two complexation reaction pathways fig 4 possesses similar energy content and same internal interactions pattern suggests that struvite formation could occur through different pyoverdine mediated pathways based on sequential addition of ions moreover to understand the role of pyoverdine in struvite formation we have performed conformer distribution calculations in the absence and presence addition of all ions at a time of pyoverdine figs 4a and 4d in the absence of pyoverdine water control the obtained struvite complex has higher 667 272 kcal mol energy content as compared to earlier formed struvite complexes figs 4d 4d in this complex fig 4a the mg2 was involved in four coordinate bonds with po4 3 and water w2 w3 molecules the po4 3 was also forming hydrogen bonding interactions with five water molecules and nh4 ion fig 4a two coordinate bonds between mg2 and po4 3 and one h bond between po4 3 and nh4 ions were observed in struvite complex which were produced in absence of pyoverdine fig 4a whereas one coordinate bond between mg2 and po4 3 and two h bonds between po4 3 and nh4 ions were noticed in struvite complex which were produced in presence of pyoverdine figs 4d 4d furthermore we have performed conformer distribution calculations on pyoverdine where all mg2 po4 3 and nh4 ions were added in a single step the resulting lowest 1425 162 kcal mol energy stable complex has similar interactions and location of struvite within the cavity of pyoverdine that observed in struvite complex produced in the presence of pyoverdine figs 4d and 4d the pyoverdine mediated all struvite complexes figs 4d 4d and 4d are energetically more stable than produced in absence of pyoverdine fig 4a which could be explained by coordinate and hydrogen bonding interactions between the complexes the interactions of water molecules with struvite and pyoverdine residues were significantly contributed to the proper positioning of struvite within the cavity of pyoverdine the first pathway pyo 6h2o mg2 po4 3 nh4 is energetically stable as compared to second pathway pyo 6h2o mg2 nh4 po4 3 therefore first pathway of complexation reaction could be more favourable for the formation of struvite nonetheless li et al 2015 used a peptide model in previous study to demonstrate in vitro struvite biomineralization in solution for e g polyaspartic acid pasp as urinary protein for studies of interaction between protein and mineral formation they suggested that pasp interacts with the ions in solution by its chelating action to form stable complexes as a result the activity of free metal ions decreased to limit crystal growth wang et al 2009 wu and grant 2002 numerous studies have shown that the presence of special acidic proteins or macromolecular matrices plays an important role in the nucleation of metal ions on the surface of the macromolecule in the biomineralization process of different mineral formation addadi et al 1987 addadi and weiner 1985 weiner 1979 2008 from the theoretical studies we concluded that magnesium ammonium and phosphate ions with water have 667 272 kcal mol of energy indicating very unstable complex whereas in presence of pyoverdine it showed very stable complex with the energy of 1416 687 kcal mol this shows that siderophore plays an important role in struvite formation by trapping the phosphate ions 4 conclusions in this study the phosphate removal strategies from the industrial sample are discussed which can help to solve the problem of phosphate contamination in water siderophore mediated sequestration of phosphate ions in the form of struvite is reported this method was feasible in low phosphate concentration and also has high reusability potential the process of in vitro struvite formation was very rapid and required very less time for the formation we also hypothesized possible mechanism of siderophore induced phosphorus mineralization into struvite for the first time we demonstrated the formation of struvite from solid industrial waste and its application in supercapacitor siderophore mediated struvite formation and its application in agriculture can be further explored similarly the modified struvite with different electrochemically active cations like ni co zn cd te sn pt etc can be prepared by using siderophore and may be used

16698,the frequently occurring redox fluctuations in paddy soil are critical to the cycling of redox sensitive elements e g iron fe and carbon due to the driving of microbial processes however the associated abiotic process such as hydroxyl radical oh formation was rarely investigated hence we examined the under appreciated role of oh formation in driving polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs degradation upon oxygenation of anoxic paddy slurries results showed that oh production largely differed in different paddy slurries in the range of 271 5 581 2 μmol kg 1 soil after 12 h reaction the oh production was highly hinged on the contents of active fe species i e exchangeable surface bound fe and fe in low crystalline phases rather than fe in high crystalline minerals or silicates besides oh production significantly decreased with increasing soil depth due to the declined active fe species and abundance of functional microbes oxygenation also induced the transformation of these active fe species into the low and high crystalline phases which might affect the following redox process the produced oh can efficiently degrade pahs with degradation extents depending on their physiochemical properties our findings highlight the key roles of active fe species in driving oh formation and organic contaminants degradation during redox fluctuations of paddy soils graphical

biotic processes knowledge referring to the abiotic processes during paddy redox fluctuations such as hydroxyl radicals oh production is rather limited the oh e0 2 7 ev one of the most powerful oxidants in natural environments can mediate a wide range of chemical reactions including the transformation of organic contaminants and cycling of nutrient elements yu and kuzyakov 2021 in recent years many studies have documented that oxygenation of reduced substances e g fe ii bearing minerals by o2 can produce abundant oh chen et al 2019a cheng et al 2020 page et al 2012 which can induce the oxidation of organic matter om emission of co2 and degradation of organic contaminants etc zhang et al 2020b thus increasing attention has been paid to the reduced substances based oh formation processes during redox oscillation events such as ground water recharge and water table fluctuations tong et al 2016 zhang et al 2020a especially in sedimentary or shallow aquifer environments minella et al 2015 page et al 2013 tong et al 2016 we hypothesize that o2 perturbation can also produce abundant oh in oxygenation of anoxic paddy soils which may accelerate the oxidative transformation of organic contaminants and soc consequently these processes may further affect the quality of surrounding water environments due to the drainage of paddy water the characteristics of paddy soil largely differed from sediments paddy soils can be cultivated from different types of soils such as mollisols shajiang aquic anthrosol and fe accumuli stagnic anthrosol based on the chinese soil taxonomy endowing them with discrepant properties for instance more high crystalline fe phases occurred in the fe accumuli stagnic anthrosol cultivated paddy soil while more low crystalline fe phases were presented in what derived from shajiang aquic anthrosol s cultivation wang et al 2019b besides frequent occurrence of redox fluctuations can largely alter the content and crystallinity of fe phases such as ferrihydrite and hematite in paddy soil winkler et al 2016 winkler et al 2018 which might consequently affect the process and mechanisms of oh formation although previous studies indicated that oh formation from oxygenation of fe ii species was much hinged on the coordination and morphology of different fe ii species chen et al 2018b chen et al 2019a cheng et al 2020 jones et al 2014 jones et al 2015 limited studies comprehensively investigated such processes in soil systems especially in paddy soils with frequent redox fluctuations hence the relative contributions of different fe species to oh formation and its environmental implications should be systemically explored hence we conducted batch experiments using different types of paddy soils to investigate oh formation during redox fluctuations we quantified oh formation in oxygenation of anoxic paddy soils under circumstance conditions and explored the underlined mechanisms the sequentially chemical extraction and state of art spectrum characterizations e g mössbauer spectra were applied to investigate the changes of different fe species and the relative contributions to oh formation were distinguished naphthalene nap phenanthrene phe and pyrene pyr are widely detected pahs in paddy fields hashmi and varma 2018 and selected as the model compounds to investigate their degradation by oh in this study table a1 the contributions of oh and microbial processes to pahs degradation were also distinguished based on the gamma γ irradiation and chemicals quenching treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the chemicals are described in text a1 2 2 paddy soil sites and sampling soil samples were collected from paddy fields located at jiangning jn 31 52 7 n 118 54 40 e jurong jr 31 32 13 n 120 47 20 e wujin

respectively for comparison non irrigated soil control was also collected at hengxi hx 31 43 32 n 118 47 2 e nearby yx site due to the similar soil type these sampling sites have a temperate monsoon climate with paddy management history for more than 30 years surface soils 0 20 cm from plough layer were collected at april in 2018 to investigate the profile of redox conditions paddy soils with depth ranged from 0 to 80 cm at step of 20 cm were also collected at jn accordingly soil samples were air dried and homogenized with visible plant debris or rocks removed soil samples were grinded to pass through a 0 15 mm diameter mesh sieve and stored in dark till further use the details for measuring soil properties were included in text a2 with results summarized in table a2 2 3 oxygenation experiments 2 3 1 anoxic incubation of paddy soils batch incubation was performed at a water soil ratio of 2 5 1 under dark briefly 20 g soil and 50 ml deoxygenated deionized water were added into 125 ml serum bottles in glovebox braun co germany then these bottles were crimp sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps and placed on the orbital shaker 200 rpm 24 1 c for incubation to re constitute the microbial activity when eh and ph became metastable after 10 d incubation figure a1 these bottles were sacrificed for oxygenation experiments 2 3 2 oxygenation experiments in typical oxygenation experiments 18 ml homogenized soil suspension was added into 40 ml brown vials in glovebox which was followed by adding 2 ml 100 mm benzoic acid ba to quantify oh the addition of 10 mm ba showed the high efficiency for oh quantification figure a2a then the vials were exposed to air for 1 min and kept shaking at 200 rpm in dark anoxic control with n2 99 9 was also performed under same conditions at predetermined time intervals 0 5 ml suspension was withdrawn into 2 ml glass vials with 0 5 ml methanol pre added and filtered through 0 22 μm membrane for analyses the oh production was estimated via measuring the p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba concentration mopper and zhou 1990 meanwhile 1 ml suspension was also withdrawn accordingly to investigate the changes of fe species by sequential extraction to distinguish oh formation from biotic processes control experiments with γ irradiation were performed at 50 k gray co source bft iv china after anoxic incubation due to the high efficiency of γ irradiation in killing microbes wang et al 2019a h2o2 concentration was also analyzed during oxygenation processes 2 3 3 pahs degradation by oh to investigate the role of oh in driving pahs degradation 10 ml anoxic soil suspension and 5 mg l 1 naphthalene nap were well mixed under anoxic conditions these bottles were immediately oxygenated as above to investigate the contribution of oh and microbial processes to pahs degradation γ irradiation or adding methanol 10 were exerted before oxygenation the effects of different paddy soils on nap degradation were concomitantly examined under same conditions to simulate the pahs removal during redox fluctuations processes 10 mg l 1 pahs 20 g soil and 50 ml deoxygenated deionized water were well mixed and then incubated as 2 3 1 after 10 d incubation the residual pahs were analyzed then paddy slurries were oxygenated as above at predetermined time intervals the reaction vials were added with methanol and centrifuged the obtained aqueous and solid phases were extracted with 10 ml mixture of n hexane dichloromethane 9 1 v v for 6 h respectively venny et al 2012 the extractions were filtered and dried by anhydrous sodium sulfate for gc ms analyses for the analyses of degradation by products the incubated slurries with pahs were γ irradiated and then oxygenated as above at predetermined time intervals the vials were added with 1 ml methanol and then centrifuged with supernatant analyzed after filtering through 0 22 μm membrane to examine the oh mediated mineralization of pahs and organic matters changes of total organic carbon toc in reaction systems were monitored before and after oxygenation in γ irradiated slurry 2 4 sample analyses 2 4 1 sequential extraction of fe species the dissolution methods for targeted minerals were summarized in table a3 with a slight modification from voelz et al 2019 all solutions were degassed with 99 9 ar before use briefly 1 ml homogeneous suspension was extracted by 10 ml 1 m cacl2 for 2 h to obtain exchangeable fe heron et al 1994 which was followed by extraction with 10 ml 0 5 m hcl for 2 h to obtain dissolve surface adsorbed fe and a portion of fe in low crystalline minerals e g ferrihydrite siderite and green rust like phase ayalaluis et al 2012 chen et al 2018a then the residuals were extracted by 10 ml 5 m hcl for 24 h for fe in high crystalline minerals e g hematite and magnetite and by 10 ml mixture of 1 3 m hf and 1 8 m h2so4 for 24 h to obtain fe in silicates and clays amonette and tampleton 1998 respectively fe ii was measured at 560 nm on a uv vis spectrometer shimadzu uv 2550 using the phenanthroline method tamura et al 1974 with total fe determined after reduction of fe iii by 10 hydroxylamine hydrochloride 2 4 2 other analyses mössbauer and xps spectra were applied to identify the fe species transformation in different treatments details were summarized in text a3 bacterial communities in hx and jn slurries at different depths were analyzed according to the previous methods wang et al 2016 with details provided in text a4 the p hba concentration was measured by the lc 15c hplc shimadzu japan the oh production was calculated with a conversion factor of 5 87 of p hba concentration mopper and zhou 1990 h2o2 was analyzed by acridinium ester based chemiluminescing reaction method zhang et al 2020a with addition of 2 2 bipyridine bpy and na2edta to minimize the interfere from fe2 and fe3 the pahs concentration was analyzed with a trace isq gc ms thermo fisher scientific austin tx usa the degradation products were analyzed with the liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight premier mass spectrometry x500r lc qtof ab sciex the toc samples were analyzed with a multi n c 3100 analytik jena germany toc analyzer details are provided in text a5 3 results and discussion 3 1 oh production during oxygenation of anoxic paddy slurries extensive oh accumulation was observed in oxygenation of paddy slurries figure 1 whereas negligible oh accumulated under anoxic conditions figure a2a the initial time points 0 0 5 and 1 h were best fitted with r 2 0 95 the pseudo zero order rate constant k obs oh the k obs oh values of yx 54 0 1 8 μm h 1 jr 85 9 1 6 μm h 1 wj 109 5 0 9 μm h 1 and jn 116 6 1 2 μm h 1 were much higher than that of hx 5 3 0 3 μm h 1 inducing 83 5 137 2 156 5 178 8 and 8 3 μm oh production 271 5 581 2 μmol kg 1 after 12 h respectively figure 1a these results indicated paddy soils produced more oh than non irrigated soil during redox fluctuations the discrepancies of oh production among these paddy slurries probably implied that active components e g fe species for oh production largely differed with each other for jn slurry with different depths k obs oh significantly decreased with the increasing depth giving value of 116 6 1 2 66 5 0 8 35 0 0 8 and 10 8 0 2 μm h 1 for jn0 20 jn20 40 jn40 60 and jn60 80 respectively these results further suggested that active components significantly altered along with the vertical soil profiles application of γ irradiation before oxygenation negligibly affected oh production figure a2a which meant o2 mediated chemical processes were mainly accountable for oh formation 3 2 identification of fe species for oh production the roles of fe ii species in oh production were examined with the addition of bpy to screen the fe2 or surface exposed fe ii katsoyiannis et al 2008 results showed that adding 20 mm bpy in wj and jn slurries inhibited 91 3 and 87 4 of oh production respectively figure a2b which denoted the fe ii species were mainly responsible for oh formation besides correlation analyses showed total fe ii tfe ii were positively correlated with oh accumulation p 0 01 figure a3a d indicating oxygenation of 1 g fe ii in jr jn wj and yx can produce 135 2 124 3 159 3 and 146 0 μmol oh respectively the different stoichiometry of oh production points to different fe ii species present in these slurries hence the exchangeable fe noted cacl2 fe surface adsorbed fe and fe in low crystalline minerals 0 5 m hcl fe fe in high crystalline minerals 5 m hcl fe and fe in silicates and clays hf fe were examined with sequential extraction 3 2 1 changes of fe ii species during oxygenation for hx only 0 43 g kg 1 5 m hcl fe ii and 0 73 g kg 1 5 m hcl fe ii were extracted at 0 h figure 2 a which indicated limited fe was reduced during incubation due to the high eh 58 2 182 3 mv however large amount of fe ii was extracted in paddy slurries figure 2b e the contents of cacl2 fe ii were 1 27 0 10 1 25 0 01 0 62 0 01and 0 34 0 01 g kg 1 for jn jr wj and yx slurries at 0 h respectively which indicated that more exchangeable fe ii presented in jn and jr than that of wj and yx during oxygenation cacl2 fe ii was almost completely oxidized within 2 h with fe ii oxidation rate k obs of 1 85 0 01 h 1 1 05 0 03 h 1 1 77 0 07 h 1 and 1 85 0 08 h 1 for jn jr wj and yx respectively table 1 the k obs cacl2 fe ii of jn wj and yx showed no significant difference p 0 05 with each other but much higher than that of jr p 0 05 which implied the oxidation mechanism of cacl2 fe ii in jr were different from other slurries at 0 h the extracted 0 5 m hcl fe ii of jn 5 12 0 31 g kg 1 was much higher than other slurries 1 94 0 01 2 79 0 09 g kg 1 during oxygenation 0 5 m hcl fe ii rapidly decreased within 2 h and slowly afterwards the k obs 0 5 m hcl fe ii of jn jr wj and yx was 0 54 0 08 h 1 0 62 0 04 h 1 0 62 0 08 h 1 and 0 39 0 04 h 1 respectively table 1 indicating the oxidation of 0 5 m hcl fe ii in jn jr and wj was faster than that in yx p 0 05 after 12 h the oxidized 0 5 m hcl fe ii of jn jr wj and yx was 3 62 0 32 1 52 0 01 2 05 0 10 and 1 28 0 05 g kg 1 respectively in comparison limited 5 m hcl fe ii 0 24 0 29 g kg 1 and hf fe ii 0 19 0 26 g kg 1 were oxidized during oxygenation table 1 these combined results probably suggested cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii were mainly responsible for oh production which might also disentangle the discrepant oh production based on different consumptions of targeted fe ii additionally application of γ irradiation rarely affected fe ii oxidation figure 2b which implied fe ii oxidation was mainly induced by o2 mediated chemical processes compared to jn0 20 the initial content of cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii significantly declined to 0 37 0 01 and 1 71 0 03 g kg 1 in jn20 40 respectively figure a4a and b however these fe ii species were rarely extracted in jn40 60 0 15 g kg 1 and jn60 80 0 11 g kg 1 the initial content of 5 m hcl and hf fe ii also slightly decreased with increasing depth giving range of 0 92 1 77 g kg 1 and 1 52 1 81 g kg 1 respectively figure a4 these results indicate that fe species were hardly reduced with increasing depth which might be attributed to the accumulation of high crystalline fe phases in deep soil chen et al 2017 3 2 2 the relative contribution of targeted fe ii species to oh production correlation analyses showed that the consumed cacl2 p 0 05 0 5 m hcl p 0 01 and 5 m hcl fe ii p 0 05 were positively correlated with oh accumulation figure a5 indicating the cacl2 0 5 m hcl and 5 m hcl fe ii were mainly responsible for oh production after oxygenation the total oxidized 0 5 m hcl fe ii 1 28 3 61 g kg 1 was much higher than cacl2 fe ii 0 34 1 25 g kg 1 and 5 m hcl fe ii 0 25 0 32 g kg 1 in these slurries table 1 which determined the relative contribution of these fe ii species following the sequence 0 5 m hcl fe ii cacl2 fe ii 5 m hcl fe ii 3 2 3 transformation of fe species during oxygenation dynamic changes of tfe were tracked to explore fe species transformation during oxygenation figure a6a e the content of tfe follows sequence of hf tfe 5 m hcl tfe 0 5 m hcl tfe cacl2 tfe in these slurries negligible changes of tfe was observed in hx probably due to the limited fe ii oxidation figure a6a for paddy slurries cacl2 tfe quickly disappeared within 2 h indicating cacl2 tfe rapidly transformed during oxygenation figure a6b e 0 5 m hcl tfe changed negligibly within 1 h and then decreased slowly the quick transformation of cacl2 fe probably counteracted the part of 0 5 m hcl tfe loss in initial periods and then 0 5 m hcl fe gradually transformed meanwhile 5 m hcl tfe rapidly increased within 2 h and slowly afterwards well corresponding to the decrease of cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl tfe these results implied that 5 m hcl tfe accumulation was attributed to the transformation of cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl tfe the hf tfe changed negligibly during oxygenation probably because the formation of silicate fe is much slower than the cycling of fe oxides winkler et al 2018 similar results were also observed in jn slurries at different depths figure a7a d these results further corroborated that cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe were highly active to participate soil redox reactions 3 2 4 identifying the transformed fe species during oxygenation to identify the transformed fe species mössbauer spectra of jn jr and wj were collected before and after oxygenation at 13 k results showed that qsd fe ii significantly decreased by 6 3 7 1 and 8 1 in jn jr and wj slurries respectively after 12 h figure 3 a c suggesting the fe ii species were oxidized by o2 xps characterization also confirmed the oxidation of surface bound fe ii by 7 5 14 2 and 4 6 in jn jr and wj slurries respectively figure a8 as xps only detected the depth of nanometers these results collectively substantiated that surface adsorbed or mineral bearing fe ii species were largely oxidized during oxygenation meanwhile the most disordered fe iii phases increased by 3 after oxygenation in these slurries which was also accompanied with the new formation of hfd fh in jn 6 0 and wj 5 8 respectively these results corroborated that oxygenation can produce more low crystalline fe species e g ferrihydrite which was consistent with the counteracted transformation of 0 5 m hcl tfe in the initial period figure a6b d additionally accumulation of hfd gt was observed in jn 6 0 jr 3 5 and wj 2 7 slurries after oxygenation and the hfd hae increased by 3 6 in wj these results substantiated high crystalline fe species e g goethite and haematite were produced after oxygenation which was well corresponding to the increased 5 m hcl tfe after oxygenation for jn slurries at different depths the content of qsd fe ii slightly decreased with increasing depth after oxygenation figure a9a d which was consistent with the decreasing extraction of total fe ii species figure a4 besides hfd fh and the most disordered fe also significantly declined by 6 0 and 8 3 from depth of 0 20 cm to 60 80 cm respectively in contrast hfd gt dramatically enhanced from 35 7 jn0 20 to 50 0 jn60 80 with increasing depth these combined results indicated more high crystalline fe species accumulated in deep soils and consequently decreased its redox activity which was in accordance with the observed increasing extraction of 5 m hcl and hf fe and decreasing oh production with increasing soil depth figure a7 and 1b 3 3 microbial community analyses high throughput sequencing of hx and jn soils with different depths was carried out in triplicates after 10 d anoxic incubation in total 636 289 high quality bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained across 15 samples examined after filtering out the poor quality sequences sequences for per sample ranged an average from 31103 to 79683 otu numbers richness were at a 97 similarity threshold with the α diversity indexes listed in table a5 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis showed that microbial community compositions were distinctly clustered in examined slurries figure 4 a indicating the bacterial communities differed from each other to further explore the discrepancies relative abundance of the 21 most abundant genera was examined figure 4b compared with hx proportion of anaerospora desulfotomaculum and deinococcus significantly p 0 05 increased in jn0 20 slurry figure 4b and 4c anaerospora and deinococcus served as the dominated fe iii reducing microbial communities in soils bao and li 2017 zhou et al 2019 which can mediate the fe reduction coupled with anaerobic ammonium oxidation driven by sulfur redox cycling hence these microbial communities regulated the dissimilatory fe iii reducing processes during anoxic incubation which further induced more fe ii accumulation in paddy slurries rather than non irrigated soil figure 2 however the proportions of these functional microbes were not significantly increased in jn40 60 and jn60 80 slurries figure 4c which was probably ascribed to the dependence on the carbon and nitrogen contents in surface soil layers table a1 consequently less fe ii species were extracted in deep soils than surface soils in jn slurry figure a4 3 4 mechanisms of fe ii species oxidation and oh formation based on above analyses oxygenation of 0 5 m hcl fe ii 1 28 3 61 g kg 1 contributed the most to oh production 0 5 m hcl fe was usually regarded as indicator of redox status of soils heron et al 1994 including a large portion of surface bound fe ii on minerals or organic ligands fe ii in green rust like phases and carbonate bound fe ii chen et al 2018a sidhu et al 1981 voelz et al 2019 oxidation of surface bound or complexed fe ii was proposed to be hinged on the types of surface bound groups such as al iii o fe ii xie et al 2020 activities of surface bound fe ii were highly affected by the electron donating ability of surface groups probably following sequence of si iv o fe ii al iii o fe ii fe iii o fe ii fe ii o fe ii ho fe ii which were attributed to the outer shell electron density of a metal generally decreasing with increasing valence xie et al 2020 hence oxygenation of these groups bound fe ii was also assumed to follow the outer sphere or inner sphere mechanisms depended on the types of surface groups jones et al 2014 jones et al 2015 for carbonate bound fe ii solution ph was the key factor affecting its oxidation king 1998 showing that fe co3 2 2 and fe2 feoh were the dominant species to describe fe ii oxidation at ph higher or lower than 6 0 respectively the oxidation rate of fe co3 2 2was approximated three orders of magnitude higher than that of feoh king 1998 indicating higher ph favored the oxidation of carbonate bound fe ii additionally the oxidation of green rust like fe ii was promoted at neutral ph compared to the acid dissolution at lower ph and intensive negative surface change at higher ph that impeded fe ii oxidation fang et al 2021 the coordination of exchangeable fe ii is similar to aqueous fe2 oxidation of exchangeable fe is proposed following the inner or out sphere mechanisms depending on ph types of ligands and fe ii coordination sites jones et al 2014 jones et al 2015 xie et al 2020 typically electron transfer via inner sphere mechanisms was relatively faster than outer sphere reaction due to more intimate electronic interaction between fe atom and oxygen molecule rosso and morgan 2002 in this case hydrolyzed or ligand complexed fe ii e g fe oh2 oh 2 favored the oxidation than hydrated forms e g fe oh2 2 6 luther 1990 scherlis and estrin 2002 for 5 m hcl fe ii representing the fe ii in high crystalline mineral phases probably included magnetite fe ii in sulfides etc based on table a3 oxidation of these fe ii species were well elucidated in previous studies fang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 however the content of oxidized 5 m hcl fe ii was much lower than cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii table 1 indicating associated oh production was to the low extent hence the discrepancies of fe ii oxygenation and oh formation were further elucidated in these paddy slurries the k obs cacl2 fe ii of jr was much lower than that of yx which was probably ascribed to the relatively low ph of jr inducing more oxygenation of exchangeable fe ii via outer sphere mechanisms besides higher content of amorphous fe species feo table a2 in jr than yx might induce more formation of green rust like fe ii and more surface fe ii adsorbed via fe iii o fe ii or fe ii o fe ii thus accelerating fe ii oxygenation satapanajaru et al 2003 xie et al 2020 which was probably responsible for the higher k obs 0 5 m hcl fe ii of jr than that of yx table 1 the green rust like fe ii was difficult to be distinguished in soil samples probably due to its low content and easy transformation during the preparation before spectroscopic measurements ayalaluis et al 2012 feder et al 2005 hence the oxidized cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii in jr were both higher than that of yx table 1 inducing more oh accumulation figure 1a compared with jr more oh was produced in wj slurry figure 1a the k obs cacl2 fe ii of wj was much higher than that of jr probably due to the outer sphere mechanisms induced by higher ph in wj slurry figure a1b however the oxidized cacl2 fe ii of wj was less than that of jr although k obs 0 5 m hcl fe ii of jr and wj showed no significant difference p 0 05 more 0 5 m hcl fe ii was oxidized in wj than jr these results collectively suggested 0 5 m hcl fe ii contributed more to oh production in wj than that of jr the k obs of cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii in jn and wj showed no significant difference p 0 05 indicating oxygenation of these fe ii species might follow the similar pattern but the content of oxidized cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii in jn was much higher than that of wj table 1 which induced more oh formation in jn based on these discussions oh production depended more on the oxidized content rather than the oxidation rate of active fe ii species in oxygenation of paddy slurries h2o2 concentration was examined to explore the pathways of oh formation the instantaneous h2o2 concentration increased rapidly within 1 h and then faded away figure a10a d which was well corresponding to the biphasic oxidation of cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii species figure 2 addition of 5 mm nitroblue tetrazolium the scavenger of o 2 significantly decreased the peak concentration of h2o2 and oh production by 75 and 71 for jn 72 and 70 for jr 74 and 75 for wj 68 and 77 for yx respectively figure a10a d which indicated both one and two electron transfer mechanisms contributed to oh formation besides good correlation p 0 01 was observed between the peak concentration of h2o2 and accumulated oh figure a11b which substantiated that h2o2 was the necessary precursor for oh production via haber weiss mechanism tong et al 2016 3 5 pahs degradation in oxygenation of paddy slurries nap degradation was investigated to examine the role of oh in driving pahs degradation during oxygenation of anoxic paddy slurries results showed that nap was relatively stable under anoxic condition in jn slurry figure 5 a however nap concentration quickly decreased by 32 9 within 2 h and slowly afterwards under oxic conditions which was well corresponding to the oh accumulation figure 1a application of γ irradiation slightly inhibited nap degradation 2 while the degradation was significantly decreased with the addition of methanol these combined results confirmed the predominant role of oh in driving pahs degradation besides nap degradation was examined during oxygenation of four paddy slurries to investigate the effects of soil types on pahs degradation the nap degradation followed the similar trend in these slurries figure 5b which showed that 34 1 30 7 29 1 and 32 6 of nap was degraded in jn wj jr and yx slurries after 12 h respectively based on previous analyses higher content of active fe ii species e g cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii were oxidized in jn than that of wj slurry table 1 which induced more oh production as well as nap degradation figure 1a and 5b similar results are also observed in comparing the wj and jr slurries however the oxidized fe ii and oh accumulation in yx were lower than that of jr slurry figure 1a and table 1 but the higher nap degradation was observed in yx slurry this is reasonable because the content of exchangeable fe ii and organic matter in yx slurry are much less than that of other slurries table 1 and a1 these two components are highly active to scavenge oh with the rate constant of 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 for fe ii and 108 m c 1 s 1 for organic matter respectively page et al 2013 rose and waite 2002 hence there are probably intense competition between fe ii and organic matter with nap for oh in jr slurry while that in yx slurry might be relatively moderate these results further indicated the utilization efficiency of oh to nap degradation in yx was higher than that in jr slurry this is consistent with the previously observed results indicating the utilization efficiency of oh decreased with increasing dosages of fe ii bearing clays due to the enhanced scavenge of oh by fe ii liu et al 2017 the degradation of pahs in the anoxic and oxic period was further examined to simulate the organic contaminants removal during redox fluctuation processes after anoxic incubation the concentration of nap phe and pyr decreased by 39 9 36 4 and 24 9 respectively in jn slurry figure 5c indicating pahs degradation via microbial processes ni et al 2018 after o2 exposure for 12 h 36 1 of nap was further degraded much higher than phe 13 2 and pyr 3 7 the second order rate constants of oh with nap and phe are 2 2 10 11 and 3 1 10 11 cm 3 mol 1 s 1 respectively atkinson 1989 which are magnitudes higher than that of pyr 2 4 10 13 cm 3 mol 1 s 1 miet et al 2009 these results indicates that nap and phe were preferentially degraded than pyr by oh attacking additionally the values of organic carbon adsorption coefficient ocac are 1 3 19 and 55 for nap phe and pyr respectively these results indicated pahs with higher ocac were more easily retained by organic matters or microaggregates in paddy slurries yu et al 2018a which can be further incorporated into soil organic matter to form tight conjugates and thus decrease their availabilities richnow et al 1998 thus the enhanced retention of pahs by soil particles induced less degradation of phe and pyr than that of nap in together the retention of pahs by particles are probable the key factor in affecting its degradation during oxygenation processes the degradation products of pahs were investigated individually during oxygenation processes there were nine ten and ten major products of nap phe and pyr identified based on lc ms ms spectra figure a12 a13 and a15 and previous studies chen et al 2019b fu et al 2018 herner et al 2001 so et al 2019 yu et al 2018b zeng et al 2021 mainly including the hydroxylated pahs e g 9 phenanthrol aldehyde based products e g phenanthrene 4 5 dicarbaldehyde carboxylated products e g 2 2 biphenyldicarboxylic acid and low molecular weight acids e g phthalic acid etc the dynamic changes of these products were also monitored based the peak intensities which showed the hydroxylated products of pahs e g 1 naphthalenol 9 phenanthrol and 4 pyrenol increased rapidly within 2 h and decreased afterwards figure a13a a15a and a17a these results further demonstrated that oh initiated the oxidation of pahs via oh addition and then these products were further oxidized to produce aldehyde based products carboxylated products low molecular weight compounds and finally co2 and h2o via ring opening and o addition mechanisms yang et al 2018 as the degradation pathways proposed in figure a13b a15b and a17b for nap phe and pyr respectively additionally toc contents in γ irradiated jn slurry significantly decreased after oxygenation figure 5d which indicated that oh oxidation induced the mineralization of pahs and organic matters during oxygenation processes 4 conclusions our findings showed that extensive oh production was observed during oxygenation of anoxic paddy slurries which also demonstrated that oh production decreased with the increasing soil depth active fe ii species such as exchangeable surface bound fe ii or fe ii in low crystalline minerals were mainly responsible for oh production the discrepancies in the content and oxidation rate of these active fe ii species well interpreted the oh production in different paddy slurries with varied constituents oxygenation of these active fe ii species induced the formation of low and high crystalline minerals e g ferrihydrite and goethite which might affect the following redox cycles of fe ii oxidation and oh production the produced oh can efficiently degraded pahs via hydroxylation and open ring mechanisms via oh attack our study highlights that abundant oh can be produced during the redox fluctuations of paddy soils and proved the central role of active fe species such as exchangeable and surface bound fe in inducing oh formation and organic contaminants degradation these findings might give new insights into the natural formation of oh during soil redox fluctuations and provide more strategies for the remediation of agricultural soils the remediation of agricultural soils that slightly polluted with organic contaminants e g pahs and herbicides might be achieved though regulating soil moisture increasing exposure of oxygen and increasing soil porosity to enhance oh formation during redox fluctuation processes hence more studies associated with natural oh production and contaminants

16698,the frequently occurring redox fluctuations in paddy soil are critical to the cycling of redox sensitive elements e g iron fe and carbon due to the driving of microbial processes however the associated abiotic process such as hydroxyl radical oh formation was rarely investigated hence we examined the under appreciated role of oh formation in driving polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs degradation upon oxygenation of anoxic paddy slurries results showed that oh production largely differed in different paddy slurries in the range of 271 5 581 2 μmol kg 1 soil after 12 h reaction the oh production was highly hinged on the contents of active fe species i e exchangeable surface bound fe and fe in low crystalline phases rather than fe in high crystalline minerals or silicates besides oh production significantly decreased with increasing soil depth due to the declined active fe species and abundance of functional microbes oxygenation also induced the transformation of these active fe species into the low and high crystalline phases which might affect the following redox process the produced oh can efficiently degrade pahs with degradation extents depending on their physiochemical properties our findings highlight the key roles of active fe species in driving oh formation and organic contaminants degradation during redox fluctuations of paddy soils graphical

food production feeding about 50 world s population as flooding and drainage frequently occur during rice growth soil redox potential eh significantly fluctuates along with the periodic anoxic oxic cycles kögel knabner et al 2010 accordingly redox sensitive elements such as iron fe manganese mn and sulfide s concurrently transform at the anoxic oxic interfaces hashmi and varma 2018 which is of great significance to biogeochemical elements cycling after flooding eh dramatically decreases due to the rapid oxygen o2 depletion which is accompanied with massive formation of reduced substances e

biotic processes knowledge referring to the abiotic processes during paddy redox fluctuations such as hydroxyl radicals oh production is rather limited the oh e0 2 7 ev one of the most powerful oxidants in natural environments can mediate a wide range of chemical reactions including the transformation of organic contaminants and cycling of nutrient elements yu and kuzyakov 2021 in recent years many studies have documented that oxygenation of reduced substances e g fe ii bearing minerals by o2 can produce abundant oh chen et al 2019a cheng et al 2020 page et al 2012 which can induce the oxidation of organic matter om emission of co2 and degradation of organic contaminants etc zhang et al 2020b thus increasing attention has been paid to the reduced substances based oh formation processes during redox oscillation events such as ground water recharge and water table fluctuations tong et al 2016 zhang et al 2020a especially in sedimentary or shallow aquifer environments minella et al 2015 page et al 2013 tong et al 2016 we hypothesize that o2 perturbation can also produce abundant oh in oxygenation of anoxic paddy soils which may accelerate the oxidative transformation of organic contaminants and soc consequently these processes may further affect the quality of surrounding water environments due to the drainage of paddy water the characteristics of paddy soil largely differed from sediments paddy soils can be cultivated from different types of soils such as mollisols shajiang aquic anthrosol and fe accumuli stagnic anthrosol based on the chinese soil taxonomy endowing them with discrepant properties for instance more high crystalline fe phases occurred in the fe accumuli stagnic anthrosol cultivated paddy soil while more low crystalline fe phases were presented in what derived from shajiang aquic anthrosol s cultivation wang et al 2019b besides frequent occurrence of redox fluctuations can largely alter the content and crystallinity of fe phases such as ferrihydrite and hematite in paddy soil winkler et al 2016 winkler et al 2018 which might consequently affect the process and mechanisms of oh formation although previous studies indicated that oh formation from oxygenation of fe ii species was much hinged on the coordination and morphology of different fe ii species chen et al 2018b chen et al 2019a cheng et al 2020 jones et al 2014 jones et al 2015 limited studies comprehensively investigated such processes in soil systems especially in paddy soils with frequent redox fluctuations hence the relative contributions of different fe species to oh formation and its environmental implications should be systemically explored hence we conducted batch experiments using different types of paddy soils to investigate oh formation during redox fluctuations we quantified oh formation in oxygenation of anoxic paddy soils under circumstance conditions and explored the underlined mechanisms the sequentially chemical extraction and state of art spectrum characterizations e g mössbauer spectra were applied to investigate the changes of different fe species and the relative contributions to oh formation were distinguished naphthalene nap phenanthrene phe and pyrene pyr are widely detected pahs in paddy fields hashmi and varma 2018 and selected as the model compounds to investigate their degradation by oh in this study table a1 the contributions of oh and microbial processes to pahs degradation were also distinguished based on the gamma γ irradiation and chemicals quenching treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the chemicals are described in text a1 2 2 paddy soil sites and sampling soil samples were collected from paddy fields located at jiangning jn 31 52 7 n 118 54 40 e jurong jr 31 32 13 n 120 47 20 e wujin wj 31 33 59 n 119 59 22 e and yixing yx 31 18 58 n 118 51 15 e in jiangsu province of china which were cultivated from mollisol alfisol entisols and inceptisol based on the us soil taxonomy staff 1999 respectively for comparison non irrigated soil control was also collected at hengxi hx 31 43 32 n 118 47 2 e nearby yx site due to the similar soil type these sampling sites have a temperate monsoon climate with paddy management history for more than 30 years surface soils 0 20 cm from plough layer were collected at april in 2018 to investigate the profile of redox conditions paddy soils with depth ranged from 0 to 80 cm at step of 20 cm were also collected at jn accordingly soil samples were air dried and homogenized with visible plant debris or rocks removed soil samples were grinded to pass through a 0 15 mm diameter mesh sieve and stored in dark till further use the details for measuring soil properties were included in text a2 with results summarized in table a2 2 3 oxygenation experiments 2 3 1 anoxic incubation of paddy soils batch incubation was performed at a water soil ratio of 2 5 1 under dark briefly 20 g soil and 50 ml deoxygenated deionized water were added into 125 ml serum bottles in glovebox braun co germany then these bottles were crimp sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps and placed on the orbital shaker 200 rpm 24 1 c for incubation to re constitute the microbial activity when eh and ph became metastable after 10 d incubation figure a1 these bottles were sacrificed for oxygenation experiments 2 3 2 oxygenation experiments in typical oxygenation experiments 18 ml homogenized soil suspension was added into 40 ml brown vials in glovebox which was followed by adding 2 ml 100 mm benzoic acid ba to quantify oh the addition of 10 mm ba showed the high efficiency for oh quantification figure a2a then the vials were exposed to air for 1 min and kept shaking at 200 rpm in dark anoxic control with n2 99 9 was also performed under same conditions at predetermined time intervals 0 5 ml suspension was withdrawn into 2 ml glass vials with 0 5 ml methanol pre added and filtered through 0 22 μm membrane for analyses the oh production was estimated via measuring the p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba concentration mopper and zhou 1990 meanwhile 1 ml suspension was also withdrawn accordingly to investigate the changes of fe species by sequential extraction to distinguish oh formation from biotic processes control experiments with γ irradiation were performed at 50 k gray co source bft iv china after anoxic incubation due to the high efficiency of γ irradiation in killing microbes wang et al 2019a h2o2 concentration was also analyzed during oxygenation processes 2 3 3 pahs degradation by oh to investigate the role of oh in driving pahs degradation 10 ml anoxic soil suspension and 5 mg l 1 naphthalene nap were well mixed under anoxic conditions these bottles were immediately oxygenated as above to investigate the contribution of oh and microbial processes to pahs degradation γ irradiation or adding methanol 10 were exerted before oxygenation the effects of different paddy soils on nap degradation were concomitantly examined under same conditions to simulate the pahs removal during redox fluctuations processes 10 mg l 1 pahs 20 g soil and 50 ml deoxygenated deionized water were well mixed and then incubated as 2 3 1 after 10 d incubation the residual pahs were analyzed then paddy slurries were oxygenated as above at predetermined time intervals the reaction vials were added with methanol and centrifuged the obtained aqueous and solid phases were extracted with 10 ml mixture of n hexane dichloromethane 9 1 v v for 6 h respectively venny et al 2012 the extractions were filtered and dried by anhydrous sodium sulfate for gc ms analyses for the analyses of degradation by products the incubated slurries with pahs were γ irradiated and then oxygenated as above at predetermined time intervals the vials were added with 1 ml methanol and then centrifuged with supernatant analyzed after filtering through 0 22 μm membrane to examine the oh mediated mineralization of pahs and organic matters changes of total organic carbon toc in reaction systems were monitored before and after oxygenation in γ irradiated slurry 2 4 sample analyses 2 4 1 sequential extraction of fe species the dissolution methods for targeted minerals were summarized in table a3 with a slight modification from voelz et al 2019 all solutions were degassed with 99 9 ar before use briefly 1 ml homogeneous suspension was extracted by 10 ml 1 m cacl2 for 2 h to obtain exchangeable fe heron et al 1994 which was followed by extraction with 10 ml 0 5 m hcl for 2 h to obtain dissolve surface adsorbed fe and a portion of fe in low crystalline minerals e g ferrihydrite siderite and green rust like phase ayalaluis et al 2012 chen et al 2018a then the residuals were extracted by 10 ml 5 m hcl for 24 h for fe in high crystalline minerals e g hematite and magnetite and by 10 ml mixture of 1 3 m hf and 1 8 m h2so4 for 24 h to obtain fe in silicates and clays amonette and tampleton 1998 respectively fe ii was measured at 560 nm on a uv vis spectrometer shimadzu uv 2550 using the phenanthroline method tamura et al 1974 with total fe determined after reduction of fe iii by 10 hydroxylamine hydrochloride 2 4 2 other analyses mössbauer and xps spectra were applied to identify the fe species transformation in different treatments details were summarized in text a3 bacterial communities in hx and jn slurries at different depths were analyzed according to the previous methods wang et al 2016 with details provided in text a4 the p hba concentration was measured by the lc 15c hplc shimadzu japan the oh production was calculated with a conversion factor of 5 87 of p hba concentration mopper and zhou 1990 h2o2 was analyzed by acridinium ester based chemiluminescing reaction method zhang et al 2020a with addition of 2 2 bipyridine bpy and na2edta to minimize the interfere from fe2 and fe3 the pahs concentration was analyzed with a trace isq gc ms thermo fisher scientific austin tx usa the degradation products were analyzed with the liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight premier mass spectrometry x500r lc qtof ab sciex the toc samples were analyzed with a multi n c 3100 analytik jena germany toc analyzer details are provided in text a5 3 results and discussion 3 1 oh production during oxygenation of anoxic paddy slurries extensive oh accumulation was observed in oxygenation of paddy slurries figure 1 whereas negligible oh accumulated under anoxic conditions figure a2a the initial time points 0 0 5 and 1 h were best fitted with r 2 0 95 the pseudo zero order rate constant k obs oh the k obs oh values of yx 54 0 1 8 μm h 1 jr 85 9 1 6 μm h 1 wj 109 5 0 9 μm h 1 and jn 116 6 1 2 μm h 1 were much higher than that of hx 5 3 0 3 μm h 1 inducing 83 5 137 2 156 5 178 8 and 8 3 μm oh production 271 5 581 2 μmol kg 1 after 12 h respectively figure 1a these results indicated paddy soils produced more oh than non irrigated soil during redox fluctuations the discrepancies of oh production among these paddy slurries probably implied that active components e g fe species for oh production largely differed with each other for jn slurry with different depths k obs oh significantly decreased with the increasing depth giving value of 116 6 1 2 66 5 0 8 35 0 0 8 and 10 8 0 2 μm h 1 for jn0 20 jn20 40 jn40 60 and jn60 80 respectively these results further suggested that active components significantly altered along with the vertical soil profiles application of γ irradiation before oxygenation negligibly affected oh production figure a2a which meant o2 mediated chemical processes were mainly accountable for oh formation 3 2 identification of fe species for oh production the roles of fe ii species in oh production were examined with the addition of bpy to screen the fe2 or surface exposed fe ii katsoyiannis et al 2008 results showed that adding 20 mm bpy in wj and jn slurries inhibited 91 3 and 87 4 of oh production respectively figure a2b which denoted the fe ii species were mainly responsible for oh formation besides correlation analyses showed total fe ii tfe ii were positively correlated with oh accumulation p 0 01 figure a3a d indicating oxygenation of 1 g fe ii in jr jn wj and yx can produce 135 2 124 3 159 3 and 146 0 μmol oh respectively the different stoichiometry of oh production points to different fe ii species present in these slurries hence the exchangeable fe noted cacl2 fe surface adsorbed fe and fe in low crystalline minerals 0 5 m hcl fe fe in high crystalline minerals 5 m hcl fe and fe in silicates and clays hf fe were examined with sequential extraction 3 2 1 changes of fe ii species during oxygenation for hx only 0 43 g kg 1 5 m hcl fe ii and 0 73 g kg 1 5 m hcl fe ii were extracted at 0 h figure 2 a which indicated limited fe was reduced during incubation due to the high eh 58 2 182 3 mv however large amount of fe ii was extracted in paddy slurries figure 2b e the contents of cacl2 fe ii were 1 27 0 10 1 25 0 01 0 62 0 01and 0 34 0 01 g kg 1 for jn jr wj and yx slurries at 0 h respectively which indicated that more exchangeable fe ii presented in jn and jr than that of wj and yx during oxygenation cacl2 fe ii was almost completely oxidized within 2 h with fe ii oxidation rate k obs of 1 85 0 01 h 1 1 05 0 03 h 1 1 77 0 07 h 1 and 1 85 0 08 h 1 for jn jr wj and yx respectively table 1 the k obs cacl2 fe ii of jn wj and yx showed no significant difference p 0 05 with each other but much higher than that of jr p 0 05 which implied the oxidation mechanism of cacl2 fe ii in jr were different from other slurries at 0 h the extracted 0 5 m hcl fe ii of jn 5 12 0 31 g kg 1 was much higher than other slurries 1 94 0 01 2 79 0 09 g kg 1 during oxygenation 0 5 m hcl fe ii rapidly decreased within 2 h and slowly afterwards the k obs 0 5 m hcl fe ii of jn jr wj and yx was 0 54 0 08 h 1 0 62 0 04 h 1 0 62 0 08 h 1 and 0 39 0 04 h 1 respectively table 1 indicating the oxidation of 0 5 m hcl fe ii in jn jr and wj was faster than that in yx p 0 05 after 12 h the oxidized 0 5 m hcl fe ii of jn jr wj and yx was 3 62 0 32 1 52 0 01 2 05 0 10 and 1 28 0 05 g kg 1 respectively in comparison limited 5 m hcl fe ii 0 24 0 29 g kg 1 and hf fe ii 0 19 0 26 g kg 1 were oxidized during oxygenation table 1 these combined results probably suggested cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii were mainly responsible for oh production which might also disentangle the discrepant oh production based on different consumptions of targeted fe ii additionally application of γ irradiation rarely affected fe ii oxidation figure 2b which implied fe ii oxidation was mainly induced by o2 mediated chemical processes compared to jn0 20 the initial content of cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii significantly declined to 0 37 0 01 and 1 71 0 03 g kg 1 in jn20 40 respectively figure a4a and b however these fe ii species were rarely extracted in jn40 60 0 15 g kg 1 and jn60 80 0 11 g kg 1 the initial content of 5 m hcl and hf fe ii also slightly decreased with increasing depth giving range of 0 92 1 77 g kg 1 and 1 52 1 81 g kg 1 respectively figure a4 these results indicate that fe species were hardly reduced with increasing depth which might be attributed to the accumulation of high crystalline fe phases in deep soil chen et al 2017 3 2 2 the relative contribution of targeted fe ii species to oh production correlation analyses showed that the consumed cacl2 p 0 05 0 5 m hcl p 0 01 and 5 m hcl fe ii p 0 05 were positively correlated with oh accumulation figure a5 indicating the cacl2 0 5 m hcl and 5 m hcl fe ii were mainly responsible for oh production after oxygenation the total oxidized 0 5 m hcl fe ii 1 28 3 61 g kg 1 was much higher than cacl2 fe ii 0 34 1 25 g kg 1 and 5 m hcl fe ii 0 25 0 32 g kg 1 in these slurries table 1 which determined the relative contribution of these fe ii species following the sequence 0 5 m hcl fe ii cacl2 fe ii 5 m hcl fe ii 3 2 3 transformation of fe species during oxygenation dynamic changes of tfe were tracked to explore fe species transformation during oxygenation figure a6a e the content of tfe follows sequence of hf tfe 5 m hcl tfe 0 5 m hcl tfe cacl2 tfe in these slurries negligible changes of tfe was observed in hx probably due to the limited fe ii oxidation figure a6a for paddy slurries cacl2 tfe quickly disappeared within 2 h indicating cacl2 tfe rapidly transformed during oxygenation figure a6b e 0 5 m hcl tfe changed negligibly within 1 h and then decreased slowly the quick transformation of cacl2 fe probably counteracted the part of 0 5 m hcl tfe loss in initial periods and then 0 5 m hcl fe gradually transformed meanwhile 5 m hcl tfe rapidly increased within 2 h and slowly afterwards well corresponding to the decrease of cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl tfe these results implied that 5 m hcl tfe accumulation was attributed to the transformation of cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl tfe the hf tfe changed negligibly during oxygenation probably because the formation of silicate fe is much slower than the cycling of fe oxides winkler et al 2018 similar results were also observed in jn slurries at different depths figure a7a d these results further corroborated that cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe were highly active to participate soil redox reactions 3 2 4 identifying the transformed fe species during oxygenation to identify the transformed fe species mössbauer spectra of jn jr and wj were collected before and after oxygenation at 13 k results showed that qsd fe ii significantly decreased by 6 3 7 1 and 8 1 in jn jr and wj slurries respectively after 12 h figure 3 a c suggesting the fe ii species were oxidized by o2 xps characterization also confirmed the oxidation of surface bound fe ii by 7 5 14 2 and 4 6 in jn jr and wj slurries respectively figure a8 as xps only detected the depth of nanometers these results collectively substantiated that surface adsorbed or mineral bearing fe ii species were largely oxidized during oxygenation meanwhile the most disordered fe iii phases increased by 3 after oxygenation in these slurries which was also accompanied with the new formation of hfd fh in jn 6 0 and wj 5 8 respectively these results corroborated that oxygenation can produce more low crystalline fe species e g ferrihydrite which was consistent with the counteracted transformation of 0 5 m hcl tfe in the initial period figure a6b d additionally accumulation of hfd gt was observed in jn 6 0 jr 3 5 and wj 2 7 slurries after oxygenation and the hfd hae increased by 3 6 in wj these results substantiated high crystalline fe species e g goethite and haematite were produced after oxygenation which was well corresponding to the increased 5 m hcl tfe after oxygenation for jn slurries at different depths the content of qsd fe ii slightly decreased with increasing depth after oxygenation figure a9a d which was consistent with the decreasing extraction of total fe ii species figure a4 besides hfd fh and the most disordered fe also significantly declined by 6 0 and 8 3 from depth of 0 20 cm to 60 80 cm respectively in contrast hfd gt dramatically enhanced from 35 7 jn0 20 to 50 0 jn60 80 with increasing depth these combined results indicated more high crystalline fe species accumulated in deep soils and consequently decreased its redox activity which was in accordance with the observed increasing extraction of 5 m hcl and hf fe and decreasing oh production with increasing soil depth figure a7 and 1b 3 3 microbial community analyses high throughput sequencing of hx and jn soils with different depths was carried out in triplicates after 10 d anoxic incubation in total 636 289 high quality bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained across 15 samples examined after filtering out the poor quality sequences sequences for per sample ranged an average from 31103 to 79683 otu numbers richness were at a 97 similarity threshold with the α diversity indexes listed in table a5 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis showed that microbial community compositions were distinctly clustered in examined slurries figure 4 a indicating the bacterial communities differed from each other to further explore the discrepancies relative abundance of the 21 most abundant genera was examined figure 4b compared with hx proportion of anaerospora desulfotomaculum and deinococcus significantly p 0 05 increased in jn0 20 slurry figure 4b and 4c anaerospora and deinococcus served as the dominated fe iii reducing microbial communities in soils bao and li 2017 zhou et al 2019 which can mediate the fe reduction coupled with anaerobic ammonium oxidation driven by sulfur redox cycling hence these microbial communities regulated the dissimilatory fe iii reducing processes during anoxic incubation which further induced more fe ii accumulation in paddy slurries rather than non irrigated soil figure 2 however the proportions of these functional microbes were not significantly increased in jn40 60 and jn60 80 slurries figure 4c which was probably ascribed to the dependence on the carbon and nitrogen contents in surface soil layers table a1 consequently less fe ii species were extracted in deep soils than surface soils in jn slurry figure a4 3 4 mechanisms of fe ii species oxidation and oh formation based on above analyses oxygenation of 0 5 m hcl fe ii 1 28 3 61 g kg 1 contributed the most to oh production 0 5 m hcl fe was usually regarded as indicator of redox status of soils heron et al 1994 including a large portion of surface bound fe ii on minerals or organic ligands fe ii in green rust like phases and carbonate bound fe ii chen et al 2018a sidhu et al 1981 voelz et al 2019 oxidation of surface bound or complexed fe ii was proposed to be hinged on the types of surface bound groups such as al iii o fe ii xie et al 2020 activities of surface bound fe ii were highly affected by the electron donating ability of surface groups probably following sequence of si iv o fe ii al iii o fe ii fe iii o fe ii fe ii o fe ii ho fe ii which were attributed to the outer shell electron density of a metal generally decreasing with increasing valence xie et al 2020 hence oxygenation of these groups bound fe ii was also assumed to follow the outer sphere or inner sphere mechanisms depended on the types of surface groups jones et al 2014 jones et al 2015 for carbonate bound fe ii solution ph was the key factor affecting its oxidation king 1998 showing that fe co3 2 2 and fe2 feoh were the dominant species to describe fe ii oxidation at ph higher or lower than 6 0 respectively the oxidation rate of fe co3 2 2was approximated three orders of magnitude higher than that of feoh king 1998 indicating higher ph favored the oxidation of carbonate bound fe ii additionally the oxidation of green rust like fe ii was promoted at neutral ph compared to the acid dissolution at lower ph and intensive negative surface change at higher ph that impeded fe ii oxidation fang et al 2021 the coordination of exchangeable fe ii is similar to aqueous fe2 oxidation of exchangeable fe is proposed following the inner or out sphere mechanisms depending on ph types of ligands and fe ii coordination sites jones et al 2014 jones et al 2015 xie et al 2020 typically electron transfer via inner sphere mechanisms was relatively faster than outer sphere reaction due to more intimate electronic interaction between fe atom and oxygen molecule rosso and morgan 2002 in this case hydrolyzed or ligand complexed fe ii e g fe oh2 oh 2 favored the oxidation than hydrated forms e g fe oh2 2 6 luther 1990 scherlis and estrin 2002 for 5 m hcl fe ii representing the fe ii in high crystalline mineral phases probably included magnetite fe ii in sulfides etc based on table a3 oxidation of these fe ii species were well elucidated in previous studies fang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 however the content of oxidized 5 m hcl fe ii was much lower than cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii table 1 indicating associated oh production was to the low extent hence the discrepancies of fe ii oxygenation and oh formation were further elucidated in these paddy slurries the k obs cacl2 fe ii of jr was much lower than that of yx which was probably ascribed to the relatively low ph of jr inducing more oxygenation of exchangeable fe ii via outer sphere mechanisms besides higher content of amorphous fe species feo table a2 in jr than yx might induce more formation of green rust like fe ii and more surface fe ii adsorbed via fe iii o fe ii or fe ii o fe ii thus accelerating fe ii oxygenation satapanajaru et al 2003 xie et al 2020 which was probably responsible for the higher k obs 0 5 m hcl fe ii of jr than that of yx table 1 the green rust like fe ii was difficult to be distinguished in soil samples probably due to its low content and easy transformation during the preparation before spectroscopic measurements ayalaluis et al 2012 feder et al 2005 hence the oxidized cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii in jr were both higher than that of yx table 1 inducing more oh accumulation figure 1a compared with jr more oh was produced in wj slurry figure 1a the k obs cacl2 fe ii of wj was much higher than that of jr probably due to the outer sphere mechanisms induced by higher ph in wj slurry figure a1b however the oxidized cacl2 fe ii of wj was less than that of jr although k obs 0 5 m hcl fe ii of jr and wj showed no significant difference p 0 05 more 0 5 m hcl fe ii was oxidized in wj than jr these results collectively suggested 0 5 m hcl fe ii contributed more to oh production in wj than that of jr the k obs of cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii in jn and wj showed no significant difference p 0 05 indicating oxygenation of these fe ii species might follow the similar pattern but the content of oxidized cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii in jn was much higher than that of wj table 1 which induced more oh formation in jn based on these discussions oh production depended more on the oxidized content rather than the oxidation rate of active fe ii species in oxygenation of paddy slurries h2o2 concentration was examined to explore the pathways of oh formation the instantaneous h2o2 concentration increased rapidly within 1 h and then faded away figure a10a d which was well corresponding to the biphasic oxidation of cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii species figure 2 addition of 5 mm nitroblue tetrazolium the scavenger of o 2 significantly decreased the peak concentration of h2o2 and oh production by 75 and 71 for jn 72 and 70 for jr 74 and 75 for wj 68 and 77 for yx respectively figure a10a d which indicated both one and two electron transfer mechanisms contributed to oh formation besides good correlation p 0 01 was observed between the peak concentration of h2o2 and accumulated oh figure a11b which substantiated that h2o2 was the necessary precursor for oh production via haber weiss mechanism tong et al 2016 3 5 pahs degradation in oxygenation of paddy slurries nap degradation was investigated to examine the role of oh in driving pahs degradation during oxygenation of anoxic paddy slurries results showed that nap was relatively stable under anoxic condition in jn slurry figure 5 a however nap concentration quickly decreased by 32 9 within 2 h and slowly afterwards under oxic conditions which was well corresponding to the oh accumulation figure 1a application of γ irradiation slightly inhibited nap degradation 2 while the degradation was significantly decreased with the addition of methanol these combined results confirmed the predominant role of oh in driving pahs degradation besides nap degradation was examined during oxygenation of four paddy slurries to investigate the effects of soil types on pahs degradation the nap degradation followed the similar trend in these slurries figure 5b which showed that 34 1 30 7 29 1 and 32 6 of nap was degraded in jn wj jr and yx slurries after 12 h respectively based on previous analyses higher content of active fe ii species e g cacl2 and 0 5 m hcl fe ii were oxidized in jn than that of wj slurry table 1 which induced more oh production as well as nap degradation figure 1a and 5b similar results are also observed in comparing the wj and jr slurries however the oxidized fe ii and oh accumulation in yx were lower than that of jr slurry figure 1a and table 1 but the higher nap degradation was observed in yx slurry this is reasonable because the content of exchangeable fe ii and organic matter in yx slurry are much less than that of other slurries table 1 and a1 these two components are highly active to scavenge oh with the rate constant of 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 for fe ii and 108 m c 1 s 1 for organic matter respectively page et al 2013 rose and waite 2002 hence there are probably intense competition between fe ii and organic matter with nap for oh in jr slurry while that in yx slurry might be relatively moderate these results further indicated the utilization efficiency of oh to nap degradation in yx was higher than that in jr slurry this is consistent with the previously observed results indicating the utilization efficiency of oh decreased with increasing dosages of fe ii bearing clays due to the enhanced scavenge of oh by fe ii liu et al 2017 the degradation of pahs in the anoxic and oxic period was further examined to simulate the organic contaminants removal during redox fluctuation processes after anoxic incubation the concentration of nap phe and pyr decreased by 39 9 36 4 and 24 9 respectively in jn slurry figure 5c indicating pahs degradation via microbial processes ni et al 2018 after o2 exposure for 12 h 36 1 of nap was further degraded much higher than phe 13 2 and pyr 3 7 the second order rate constants of oh with nap and phe are 2 2 10 11 and 3 1 10 11 cm 3 mol 1 s 1 respectively atkinson 1989 which are magnitudes higher than that of pyr 2 4 10 13 cm 3 mol 1 s 1 miet et al 2009 these results indicates that nap and phe were preferentially degraded than pyr by oh attacking additionally the values of organic carbon adsorption coefficient ocac are 1 3 19 and 55 for nap phe and pyr respectively these results indicated pahs with higher ocac were more easily retained by organic matters or microaggregates in paddy slurries yu et al 2018a which can be further incorporated into soil organic matter to form tight conjugates and thus decrease their availabilities richnow et al 1998 thus the enhanced retention of pahs by soil particles induced less degradation of phe and pyr than that of nap in together the retention of pahs by particles are probable the key factor in affecting its degradation during oxygenation processes the degradation products of pahs were investigated individually during oxygenation processes there were nine ten and ten major products of nap phe and pyr identified based on lc ms ms spectra figure a12 a13 and a15 and previous studies chen et al 2019b fu et al 2018 herner et al 2001 so et al 2019 yu et al 2018b zeng et al 2021 mainly including the hydroxylated pahs e g 9 phenanthrol aldehyde based products e g phenanthrene 4 5 dicarbaldehyde carboxylated products e g 2 2 biphenyldicarboxylic acid and low molecular weight acids e g phthalic acid etc the dynamic changes of these products were also monitored based the peak intensities which showed the hydroxylated products of pahs e g 1 naphthalenol 9 phenanthrol and 4 pyrenol increased rapidly within 2 h and decreased afterwards figure a13a a15a and a17a these results further demonstrated that oh initiated the oxidation of pahs via oh addition and then these products were further oxidized to produce aldehyde based products carboxylated products low molecular weight compounds and finally co2 and h2o via ring opening and o addition mechanisms yang et al 2018 as the degradation pathways proposed in figure a13b a15b and a17b for nap phe and pyr respectively additionally toc contents in γ irradiated jn slurry significantly decreased after oxygenation figure 5d which indicated that oh oxidation induced the mineralization of pahs and organic matters during oxygenation processes 4 conclusions our findings showed that extensive oh production was observed during oxygenation of anoxic paddy slurries which also demonstrated that oh production decreased with the increasing soil depth active fe ii species such as exchangeable surface bound fe ii or fe ii in low crystalline minerals were mainly responsible for oh production the discrepancies in the content and oxidation rate of these active fe ii species well interpreted the oh production in different paddy slurries with varied constituents oxygenation of these active fe ii species induced the formation of low and high crystalline minerals e g ferrihydrite and goethite which might affect the following redox cycles of fe ii oxidation and oh production the produced oh can efficiently degraded pahs via hydroxylation and open ring mechanisms via oh attack our study highlights that abundant oh can be produced during the redox fluctuations of paddy soils and proved the central role of active fe species such as exchangeable and surface bound fe in inducing oh formation and organic contaminants degradation these findings might give new insights into the natural formation of oh during soil redox fluctuations and provide more strategies for the remediation of agricultural soils the remediation of agricultural soils that slightly polluted with organic contaminants e g pahs and herbicides might be achieved though regulating soil moisture increasing exposure of oxygen and increasing soil porosity to enhance oh formation during redox fluctuation processes hence more studies associated with natural oh production and contaminants

16699,shallow lakes are considered important contributors to emissions of nitrous oxide n2o a powerful greenhouse gas in aquatic ecosystems there is a large degree of uncertainty regarding the relationship between n2o emissions and the progress of lake eutrophication and the mechanisms underlying n2o emissions are poorly understood here n2o emission fluxes and environmental variables in different lakes along a trophic state gradient in the yangtze river basin were studied n2o emission fluxes were 1 0 53 0 μg m 2 h 1 and 0 4 102 9 μg m 2 h 1 in summer and winter respectively indicating that there was marked variation in n2o emissions among lakes of different trophic state the non linear exponential model explained differences in n2o emission fluxes by the degree of eutrophication p 0 01 tn and chl a both predicted 86 of the n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes the predicted n2o emission fluxes based on the ipcc ef5r overestimated the observed fluxes particularly those in hyper eutrophic lakes these findings demonstrated that nutrient rich conditions and algal accumulation are key factors determining n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes furthermore this study also revealed that temperature and algae accumulation decomposition determine an n2o emission flux in an intricate manner a low temperature i e winter limits algae growth and low oxygen consumption for algae decomposition the environment leaves a high dissolved oxygen concentration slowing down n2o consumption as the final step of denitrification in summer with the oxygen consumed by excess algal decomposition the n2o production is limited by the complete denitrification as well as the limited substrate supply of nitrate by nitrification in hypoxic or anoxic conditions such cascading events explained the higher n2o emission fluxes from shallow lakes in winter compared with summer this trend was amplified in hyper eutrophic shallow lakes after algal disappearance collectively algal accumulation played a dual role in stimulating and impeding n2o emissions especially in hyper eutrophic lakes this study expands our knowledge of n2o emissions from shallow lakes in which eutrophication is underway graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide biogeographic scale eutrophication functional gene algal accumulation 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is an ozone depleting and highly potent greenhouse gas ghg with a long half life that contributes to global warming in addition to carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 in the stratosphere ravishankara et al 2009 atmospheric n2o has increased by 20 from 1750 to 2018 and is steadily increasing at a rate of 0 2 per year tian et al 2020 the ipcc reported that approximately 10 of anthropogenic n2o sources are derived from freshwater and coastal marine systems ipcc 2013 given that inland freshwater lakes are recipients of nutrients transported from terrestrial ecosystems to trigger uncertainty of ghg emissions wang et al 2009 zhou et al 2020c they function as n2o hot spots where the high turnover of nitrogen n compounds hence the n2o emissions from aquatic ecosystems have received considerable attention beaulieu et al 2011 kortelainen et al 2020 although multiple factors such as nutrient composition eutrophication and temperature likely regulate n2o emissions from freshwater lakes at regional and global scales the dominant factors affecting n2o emissions in freshwater lakes remain poorly understood kortelainen et al 2020 li et al 2018 yan et al 2017 there is also a need to evaluate and quantify the n2o emissions of freshwater lake ecosystems given that they are globally significant sources of n2o lauerwald et al 2019 generally understanding the mechanisms underlying variation in n2o emissions from freshwater lakes can aid the development of policies to address global warming n2o is mainly produced by a by product from nitrification and an intermediate from denitrification wenk et al 2016 of these multiple sources denitrification is thought to be a main source of n2o in aquatic ecosystems beaulieu et al 2011 li et al 2019a salk and ostrom 2019 n2o reduction the final step of denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 is catalyzed by n2o reductase which is encoded by the nosz gene yoon et al 2016 denitrification plays a critical role in determining n2o emission fluxes including whether aquatic ecosystems are n2o sources or sinks n2o production is regulated by microbial community structure in aquatic ecosystems zhao et al 2018 2019 microbial community composition affects the amount of n2o emissions as some bacteria lack nosz and nitrite reductase genes which significantly contribute to n2o consumption and production in natural ecosystems respectively domeignoz horta et al 2016 among several environmental factors nutrients redox conditions and temperature determine the microbial guilds involved in n2o production and consumption hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 xiao et al 2019 seasonal changes involve multiple environmental fluctuations that affect lacustrine microbial community structure song et al 2012 and lead to uncertainty in the magnitude of n2o emissions n conversion rates and eutrophication progress are crucial for regulating final n forms n2 or n2o in aquatic ecosystems jiang et al 2020 salk and ostrom 2019 zhu et al 2020 such n conversions are dynamic and dependent on eutrophication progress li et al 2018 liikanen et al 2003 there is thus a need to understand the microbial processes that regulate n2o sources or sinks in lakes of different trophic state and determine spatial heterogeneity in n2o emissions shallow lakes receive massive amounts of nutrients from anthropogenic activities which potentially lead to changes in lake trophic state zhou et al 2020c 2019 ghg emissions from eutrophic shallow lakes have also been surveyed and this work has shed light on differences in n2o emission fluxes among shallow lakes of different trophic state in these surveys the commonly used default emission factor ef5r by the ipcc has been used maavara et al 2019 which results in either an underestimation or overestimation of the n2o budgets in freshwater ecosystems of different trophic state zhang et al 2020 for example xiao et al al 2019 indicated that the mean n2o emission fluxes in the east and west zones of lake taihu eutrophic and oligotrophic respectively were substantially different which is partially caused by n flowing to the lake in addition n loadings regulate the distribution of denitrifying bacteria which is often indicated by functional genes for n2o production nirs and nirk and consumption nosz huang et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 high n flowing to eutrophic lakes increases algal growth potentially enhancing n2o emissions and n turnover rates yan et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 however the accumulation of algae alters the redox conditions favoring denitrification yan et al 2017 and more severe anoxic conditions limit the supply of nitrogen oxides generated by nitrification required for denitrification zhu et al 2020 these observations impede our understanding of the role of algae in n2o emissions such correlations in eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes have been extensively investigated lauerwald et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 however shallow lakes have been poorly studied in particular no studies have compared n2o emission fluxes among lakes of different trophic state salk and ostrom 2019 the trophic state of lakes leads to uncertainty in n2o emission estimates kortelainen et al 2020 yet the relationship between n2o emission fluxes and the trophic state of lakes is not entirely decoupled studies of the n2o emissions of lacustrine trophic states on a biogeographic scale could help enhance our understanding of their potential to act as sources of n2o emissions approximately 0 9 of china is covered with lakes there are a total of 2693 lakes 1 0 km2 about one third of which are shallow lakes located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin ma et al 2011 to enhance our understanding of the relationship between n2o emissions and eutrophication in shallow lakes in the yangtze river basin we characterized spatiotemporal variation in n2o emission fluxes and its underlying mechanisms in 17 lakes along a trophic state gradient at a biogeographic scale we constructed a model to predict the n2o emission patterns in shallow lakes of different trophic state the aims of this study were to i identify n2o emission patterns in shallow lakes of different trophic state ii characterize differences in the main microorganisms and functional genes for n2o emissions in the sediments in shallow lakes of different trophic state iii evaluate the relationship between environmental variables and n2o emissions to reveal the main drivers of n2o emissions and iv elucidate the role of algae on n2o emissions in shallow lakes the results of this study enhance our ability to accurately predict n2o emission patterns from shallow lakes 2 material and methods 2 1 field survey 2 1 1 lakes of different trophic state this study designated 17

in the winter dataset among these examined lakes the ranges of n2o emission fluxes were 1 0 53 0 μg m 2 h 1 and 0 4 102 9 μg m 2 h 1 in summer and winter respectively indicating a high degree of variation in n2o emission fluxes table s1 and fig 2 in addition all examined lakes were n2o sources with the exception of mesotrophic lakes in summer the mean n2o emission fluxes of the middle

unimodal relationship with tli fig 3 a among these examined lakes the lowest dissolved n2 concentration was observed in hyper eutrophic lakes there was a significant unimodal relationship between the dissolved n2 concentration and tli p 0 001 the excess dissolved n2 n2 which was obtained by subtracting dissolved n2 from the saturated concentration was consistently positive 8 1 16 1 μmol l 1 in summer indicating n2 oversaturation the trend of n2 oversaturation as a function of tli was consistent with dissolved n2 fig 3 3 3 relationship between environmental factors and n2o emission fluxes

abundances of microbes were obtained at the phylum level in summer and winter fig 5 overall the top 15 phyla made up more than 80 of microbial communities in all lake sediments the following six phyla accounted for over 60 of the total population in summer proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes acidobacteria verrucomicrobia and planctomycetes those in the winter were proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria nitrospirae planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria which had relative abundances in hyper eutrophic middle eutrophic eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes of 30 6 44 2 32 3 42 4 31 8 39 9 and 32 0 46 4 respectively proteobacteria 26 4 43 4 was also common in all lakes in winter among the six dominant phyla the relative abundances of chloroflexi were 2 8 5 7 in winter and 4 7 15 9 in summer the relative abundances of nitrospirae were 2 3 9 7 in winter and 0 1 4 1 in summer the nirs gene abundances in winter 0 66 107 3 67 107 copies g 1 sediment were lower than those in summer 2 70 107 7 62 108 copies g 1 sediment fig s5 by contrast no significant difference was observed for nirk gene abundances in winter 0 36 107 2 29 107 copies g 1 sediment and summer 0 06 107 2 06 107 copies g 1 sediment the nirs nirk ratio was greater than 1 indicating that the nirs type denitrifiers were consistently more abundant than nirk type denitrifiers in these shallow lakes fig 6 a the ratios were 9 48 times higher in summer than in winter in addition the nirs nirk ratio increased as tli increased in summer and winter p 0 05 nirs nirk and n2o emission fluxes were also positively correlated fig s6a the abundance of nosz which encodes an enzyme for n2o consumption varied from 0 31 107 copies g 1 sediment to 2 88 107 copies g 1 sediment in winter which was lower than that in summer 0 53 107 7 02 107 copies g 1 sediment fig s5 variation in the ratios of nirk nirs nosz was lower among the shallow lakes in winter 0 8 9 5 than in summer 2 9 12 3 fig 6b the ratio of nirk nirs nosz was positively correlated with tli p 0 022 and n2o emission flux fig s6b further analysis revealed the relationship between the spatial distribution of these denitrifying genes and multiple environmental factors fig 7 a redundancy analysis rda showed that the first two axes explained 60 38 of the variation in the denitrifying genes the samples of the examined lakes were well separated among the different seasons the rda between the denitrifying gene abundances and environmental parameters indicated that temperature was an important factor affecting gene abundances among the tested parameters nirs and nosz abundances were sensitive to temperature compared with nirk the dissimilarity in the abundance of denitrifying genes in lakes of different trophic state was greater in summer than in winter the abundance of nirs was positively correlated with tli and the abundance of nosz was marginally correlated with tli 3 5 characterization of n2o emissions in the heavy algae accumulated and light algae accumulated zones in lake taihu the n loading and chl a concentrations were higher in the heavy algae accumulated zones zones a and b than in the light algae accumulated zone zone d table s2 the n2o emissions fluxes were characterized in summer and winter in the two typical zones in lake taihu the n2o emission fluxes were significantly higher in the heavy algae accumulated zones zones a and b and transitional zone zone c than in the light algae accumulated zone zone d the n2o emission fluxes were location dependent and varied from 42 16 to 136 63 μg m 2 h 1 in the heavy algae accumulated zones zones a and b 21 35 31 89 μg m 2 h 1 in the transitional zone zone c and 3 7 4 71 μg m 2 h 1 in the light algae accumulated zone zone d fig 8 these fluxes in the algae accumulated zones were significantly different in summer and winter p 0 05 and differences were not significant in zone c p 0 076 and zone d p 0 677 there was an exponential relationship between tli and n2o emission fluxes fig s7 adj r2 0 55 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 nonlinear n2o emission patterns shallow lakes are potential sources of n2o emissions and have been extensively studied kortelainen et al 2020 lauerwald et al 2019 mccrackin and elser 2011 previous studies have documented variation in n2o emissions across lakes of different trophic state kortelainen et al 2020 salk and ostrom 2019 nevertheless predicting n2o emission fluxes from shallow lakes remains a challenge this study showed that the net n2o emission fluxes in lakes located in the yangtze river basin which spans 1000 km displayed spatial and temporal heterogeneity determined by lake trophic state fig 2 consistent with previous studies salk and ostrom 2019 xiao et al 2019 zhou et al 2020c these findings indicate that eutrophic lakes in the yangtze river basin are sources of n2o emissions the patterns of n2o emission fluxes in the shallow lakes were not completely consistent with the results of previous studies and depended on eutrophication progress the n2o emission fluxes in the eutrophic and middle eutrophic lakes table s1 were similar to the global median value of n2o emission flux in lakes whereas the mean n2o emission flux in the hyper eutrophic lakes was 8 7 11 2 times higher than the global median value hu et al 2016 shallow lakes in a mesotrophic state in summer were n2o sinks fig 2 and table s1 these findings expand our knowledge regarding the prerequisites for freshwater lakes to act as either n2o sinks or sources lauerwald et al 2019 our study underscores the significance of lake trophic state in determining n2o emission fluxes which is supported by the correlation between net n2o emission flux and trophic state fig 2a whether lakes of different trophic state act as n2o sources or sinks can be predicted based on this correlation the major contribution of this study is the exponential model based on tli which could provide a robust means for quantifying lake trophic state this model can be used to predict the n2o emissions from lakes this model represents an improvement over previous approaches for estimating n2o emission fluxes because previous approaches do not consider differences in lake trophic state lauerwald et al 2019 this model can be used to assess n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes of different trophic state the n2o emission fluxes and tli were well fitted in summer adj r2 0 85 and winter adj r2 0 63 however the coefficient of determination was low adj r2 0 36 when all data i e summer and winter were incorporated into the model which is likely explained by the large differences in n2o emission fluxes in winter and summer fig 2 therefore seasonal differences in n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes should also receive consideration kortelainen et al 2020 miao et al 2020 given the limited data on seasonal differences and the limited number of shallow lakes investigated more data on n2o emission fluxes are required to verify the credibility of the model 4 2 potential drivers of n2o emissions our results revealed that reactive n accumulation plays a major role in regulating lake trophic state levels and the biological n cycle and promotes n2o emissions via denitrification in shallow lakes degradation and metabolism were similar among shallow lakes despite variation in trophic state proteobacteria was identified as a predominant phylum based on the 16s rrna gene analysis and it was commonly detected in lakes of different trophic state fig 5 li et al 2019b proteobacteria might potentially contribute to degradation and metabolism huang et al 2019 previous studies have indicated that copiotrophic groups such as proteobacteria and bacteroidetes with high growth rates tend to thrive in nutrient rich conditions fierer et al 2012 the overlying water and sediments likely stored abundant nutrients that could be used by microorganisms in shallow lakes in addition nutrient abundance is an important factor affecting the microorganisms responsible for n conversion saarenheimo et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the denitrifying genes varied greatly among the different trophic lakes and seasons figs 6 and s5 these results suggest that denitrification is an important source of n2o emissions in shallow eutrophic lakes which is consistent with the results of previous studies beaulieu et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 this is also confirmed by the stronger correlation of n2o emission flux with no3 than with nh4 fig 4 and the negative correlation between do and n2o emission fluxes table s4 the significant relationship between tli and nirk nirs nosz p 0 022 which indicates the relative abundance of n2o producers relative to n2o consumers suggests that n2o production may be greater than n2o consumption in hyper eutrophic lakes fig 6b zhao et al 2018 higher net n2o emission fluxes were observed in hyper eutrophic lakes because of their higher nutrient availability and nirk nirs nosz kortelainen et al 2020 these findings might explain the close relationship between lake trophic state and n2o emission flux n availability drives eutrophication and the subsequent accumulation of algae alters the redox conditions favoring denitrification yan et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 and increases n2o emissions in shallow lakes in freshwater ecosystems n loadings significantly contribute to n2o emissions via denitrification kortelainen et al 2020 mulholland et al 2008 which explains the high n2o emission fluxes observed in eutrophic lakes when n loading was high figs 2 and 4 a stepwise linear regression model indicated that tn and chl a algal density are important parameters explaining n2o emissions table 1 following algal accumulation algal decay alters redox conditions and releases organic matter in situ yan et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 moreover algal blooms result in low do concentrations and the accumulation of organic matter in hyper eutrophic lakes yan et al 2017 zhou et al 2020a zhu et al 2020 for example algal accumulation in lake taihu accounts for 50 of the organic matter xu et al 2019 a c n ratio lower than 8 indicates that organic matter is mainly derived from autochthonous inputs meyers 1994 yan et al 2017 the negative correlation between c n ratio and tli fig s3 indicates that algal accumulation and decomposition alter the physicochemical conditions in shallow lakes therefore the contribution of algal decomposition should receive increased consideration when exploring the relationship between n2o emission fluxes and chl a our results indicated that n2o emission fluxes and the c n ratio were negatively correlated p 0 001 fig s5 algal decomposition results in oxygen consumption and thus a low do concentration which is favorable for denitrification zhu et al 2020 this observation is consistent with the negative correlation between do and chl a tables s4 and s5 these findings might potentially explain the roles of decomposed algae in stimulating n2o emissions via consumed oxygen in eutrophic shallow lakes temperature is an important variable determining denitrifier abundance and structure in both seasons figs 6 and 7 the effect of temperature was also manifested by the differences in n2o emissions among seasons fig 2 this pattern is similar to a previous study of 87 boreal lakes in finland showing that n2o emissions peaked in winter kortelainen et al 2020 among enzymes responsible for denitrification n2o reductase is most sensitive to changes in temperature kortelainen et al 2020 veraart et al 2011 zhou et al 2020c our previous study indicated that nosz in n2o reducing bacteria is strongly related to temperature zhou et al 2020c in addition n2o reduction activity is inhibited by oxygen exposure which increases n2o emissions song et al 2019 low temperature increased the oxygen concentration fig s1 and the relationship between the ratio of nirs to nirk with tli varied in winter slope 0 08 and summer slope 1 11 p 0 05 fig 6a given that the algae in lakes gradually declined in winter concomitant with increasing do concentrations fig s1 and table s1 n2o emission fluxes in lakes increased in winter fig 2a miao et al 2020 in summer algal decay further decreased the oxygen concentration previous studies have shown that nirk only achieves high abundances in conditionally oxygen exposed environment huang et al 2011 whereas nirs genes have been more commonly detected in anoxic locations knapp et al 2009 the observation that the n2o emission fluxes nirs nirk and nirs nirk nosz showed more significant positive relationships in winter than in summer suggests that the n2o emission fluxes in summer were also affected by other factors fig s6 the dramatic difference between hyper eutrophic lakes in winter and summer was in the frequency of algal blooms in hyper eutrophic lakes in summer the algae regulating n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes are discussed in the subsequent section in sum low temperature associated with abundant n favored n2o accumulation via control oxygen concentrations and limit n2o reduction activity 4 3 dual impact of algae on n2o emissions n2o emissions were highest and the chl a concentration low in zone b in contrast to zone a in a heavy algae accumulated zone of lake taihu fig 8 and table s2 this result is inconsistent with the finding that algal accumulation reflected by tli stimulated n2o emissions in a non linear exponential manner in the other tested lakes fig s7 in heavy algae accumulated zones lower n2o emissions indicated by the high chl a concentration likely stem from algal accumulation which suppresses denitrification activities caused by the decrease in n2o production recently zhu et al 2020 reported that algal accumulation may inhibit denitrification during algal blooms in summer consistent with this finding a unimodal relationship between tli and excess dissolved n2 n2 in summer was observed fig 3b which indicated higher complete denitrification i e including n2o consumption rates in the eutrophic lakes chen et al 2014 wang et al 2018 in summer the highest gene abundances of nirk nirs and nosz were observed in eutrophic and middle eutrophic lakes rather than in hyper eutrophic lakes fig s5 although more abundant n is available in hyper eutrophic lakes the complete denitrification rates may be lower in hyper eutrophic lakes than in eutrophic lakes in summer this pattern potentially stems from the abundance of algal biomass in the hyper eutrophic lakes as release of algal debris eventually leads to reductive conditions table s2 the decay of excess algal biomass could create favorable conditions for denitrification where organic carbon is present under hypoxic or anoxic conditions however hypoxia limits nitrification which leads to a deficiency in the supply of no3 for denitrification small et al 2014 zhu et al 2020 this effect is supported by previous work in zones with accumulated algae in lake taihu showing that the nh4 concentration in sediments is two or three orders of magnitude higher than the no3 concentration yan et al 2019 our results are also consistent with this observation table s2 in addition chl a as a negative factor and tn together predicted the n2o emission fluxes table 1 algal accumulation and decomposition create hypoxic conditions that limit nitrification by converting nh4 into no3 eventually suppressing the ensuing denitrification in addition hypoxic conditions favor complete denitrifying bacteria for mitigating n2o emissions these results further explain why higher n2o emission fluxes of shallow lakes were observed in winter rather than in summer figs 2a and 8 therefore these evidences indicated that algal accumulation played a dual role in stimulating and impeding n2o emissions especially in hyper eutrophic lakes 4 4 implications of eutrophication progress on n2o emissions in aquatic ecosystems excessive n loadings drive eutrophication and promote n2o emissions in water bodies zhao et al 2015 meanwhile the nutrient overload induces algae growth in shallow lakes forming an anoxic or microaerobic micro environment favoring n2o production by algae accumulation zhu et al 2020 in this study a nonlinear exponential increase in n2o emission flux as a function of tli in shallow lakes of different trophic state was observed fig 2 eutrophic lakes had high n2o emission fluxes which is consistent with the relationship between lake trophic state and ch4 emission fluxes zhou et al 2020a the common trends indicate that increases in ghg emissions stem from eutrophication the predicted n2o emission fluxes based on the ipcc ef5r overestimated the observed fluxes but also exhibited a non linear exponential increase with tli fig 2b xiao et al 2019 reported that the n2o emission factor in lake taihu was 0 18 which is lower than the value of ef5r based on the reported ipcc value the overestimation by the ipcc default value indicates the need to calibrate an n2o emission factor in shallow lakes depending on the eutrophic state pronounced differences between the predicted and observed n2o emission fluxes were observed in hyper eutrophic lakes where the abundance of algae impeded n2o emissions the high abundance of algae in summer compared with winter indicates that the degree to which n2o emission flux was overestimated in summer was different from that in winter fig s2 algal decomposition made the redox conditions favorable for denitrification but unfavorable for nitrification because of an insufficient supply of no3 the retained nitrogen is absorbed by the newly grown algae zhu et al 2020 in non limited n algal decay leads to low oxygen conditions which enhances denitrification and further stimulates n2o emissions therefore algae should be considered a n pool that maintains nitrogen in lakes in such situations where algae pools n lower n2o emissions stemming from the suppression of nitrification do not contribute to the reduction in global n2o emissions from lakes but potentially leads to substantial n2o emissions from hyper eutrophic state lakes when conditions for nitrification are suitable we suggest that overestimation was possibly caused by the dual role of the algae because they help re regulate denitrification to mitigate n2o emissions estimation of flux by the two layer model was one order of magnitude lower than that estimated by static chamber methods duchemin et al 1999 given that the two different methods plausibly overestimated or underestimated the n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes an intensive survey of an n2o emission factor in hyper eutrophic lakes will be conducted in a follow up study 5 conclusions we performed a series of field measurements and characterized the n2o emissions in shallow lakes of different trophic state in the yangtze river basin the results of this study are detailed below the n2o emission fluxes of shallow lakes were most strongly affected by lake trophic state suggesting that estimation of n2o emission fluxes should consider lake trophic state the nonlinear model incorporating trophic state levels can describe the n2o emissions from a shallow lake the predicted n2o emission fluxes based on the ipcc ef5r overestimated the observed fluxes particularly those in hyper eutrophic lakes nutrient rich conditions and algal accumulation were key factors determining n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes and algal accumulation played a dual role in stimulating and impeding n2o emissions especially in hyper eutrophic lakes changes in season accompanied the appearance and disappearance of algae and altered n2o emission fluxes especially in hyper eutrophic lakes declaration of competing interest the

16699,shallow lakes are considered important contributors to emissions of nitrous oxide n2o a powerful greenhouse gas in aquatic ecosystems there is a large degree of uncertainty regarding the relationship between n2o emissions and the progress of lake eutrophication and the mechanisms underlying n2o emissions are poorly understood here n2o emission fluxes and environmental variables in different lakes along a trophic state gradient in the yangtze river basin were studied n2o emission fluxes were 1 0 53 0 μg m 2 h 1 and 0 4 102 9 μg m 2 h 1 in summer and winter respectively indicating that there was marked variation in n2o emissions among lakes of different trophic state the non linear exponential model explained differences in n2o emission fluxes by the degree of eutrophication p 0 01 tn and chl a both predicted 86 of the n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes the predicted n2o emission fluxes based on the ipcc ef5r overestimated the observed fluxes particularly those in hyper eutrophic lakes these findings demonstrated that nutrient rich conditions and algal accumulation are key factors determining n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes furthermore this study also revealed that temperature and algae accumulation decomposition determine an n2o emission flux in an intricate manner a low temperature i e winter limits algae growth and low oxygen consumption for algae decomposition the environment leaves a high dissolved oxygen concentration slowing down n2o consumption as the final step of denitrification in summer with the oxygen consumed by excess algal decomposition the n2o production is limited by the complete denitrification as well as the limited substrate supply of nitrate by nitrification in hypoxic or anoxic conditions such cascading events explained the higher n2o emission fluxes from shallow lakes in winter compared with summer this trend was amplified in hyper eutrophic shallow lakes after algal disappearance collectively algal accumulation played a dual role in stimulating and impeding n2o emissions especially in hyper eutrophic lakes this study expands our knowledge of n2o emissions from shallow lakes in which eutrophication is underway graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide biogeographic scale eutrophication functional gene algal accumulation 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is an ozone depleting and highly potent greenhouse gas ghg with a long half life that contributes to global warming in addition to carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 in the stratosphere ravishankara et al 2009 atmospheric n2o has increased by 20 from 1750 to 2018 and is steadily increasing at a rate of 0 2 per year tian et al 2020 the ipcc reported that approximately 10 of anthropogenic n2o sources are derived from freshwater and coastal marine systems ipcc 2013 given that inland freshwater lakes are recipients of nutrients transported from terrestrial ecosystems to trigger uncertainty of ghg emissions wang et al 2009 zhou et al 2020c they function as n2o hot spots where the high turnover of nitrogen n compounds hence the n2o emissions from aquatic ecosystems have received considerable attention beaulieu et al 2011 kortelainen et al 2020 although multiple factors such as nutrient composition eutrophication and temperature likely regulate n2o emissions from freshwater lakes at regional and global scales the dominant factors affecting n2o emissions in freshwater lakes remain poorly understood kortelainen et al 2020 li et al 2018 yan et al 2017 there is also a need to evaluate and quantify the n2o emissions of freshwater lake ecosystems given that they are globally significant sources of n2o lauerwald et al 2019 generally understanding the mechanisms underlying variation in n2o emissions from freshwater lakes can aid the development of policies to address global warming n2o is mainly produced by a by product from nitrification and an intermediate from denitrification wenk et al 2016 of these multiple sources denitrification is thought to be a main source of n2o in aquatic ecosystems beaulieu et al 2011 li et al 2019a salk and ostrom 2019 n2o reduction the final step of denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 is catalyzed by n2o reductase which is encoded by the nosz gene yoon et al 2016 denitrification plays a critical role in determining n2o emission fluxes including whether aquatic ecosystems are n2o sources or sinks n2o production is regulated by microbial community structure in aquatic ecosystems zhao et al 2018 2019 microbial community composition affects the amount of n2o emissions as some bacteria lack nosz and nitrite reductase genes which significantly contribute to n2o consumption and production in natural ecosystems respectively domeignoz horta et al 2016 among several environmental factors nutrients redox conditions and temperature determine the microbial guilds involved in n2o production and consumption hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 xiao et al 2019 seasonal changes involve multiple environmental fluctuations that affect lacustrine microbial community structure song et al 2012 and lead to uncertainty in the magnitude of n2o emissions n conversion rates and eutrophication progress are crucial for regulating final n forms n2 or n2o in aquatic ecosystems jiang et al 2020 salk and ostrom 2019 zhu et al 2020 such n conversions are dynamic and dependent on eutrophication progress li et al 2018 liikanen et al 2003 there is thus a need to understand the microbial processes that regulate n2o sources or sinks in lakes of different trophic state and determine spatial heterogeneity in n2o emissions shallow lakes receive massive amounts of nutrients from anthropogenic activities which potentially lead to changes in lake trophic state zhou et al 2020c 2019 ghg emissions from eutrophic shallow lakes have also been surveyed and this work has shed light on differences in n2o emission fluxes among shallow lakes of different trophic state in these surveys the commonly used default emission factor ef5r by the ipcc has been used maavara et al 2019 which results in either an underestimation or overestimation of the n2o budgets in freshwater ecosystems of different trophic state zhang et al 2020 for example xiao et al al 2019 indicated that the mean n2o emission fluxes in the east and west zones of lake taihu eutrophic and oligotrophic respectively were substantially different which is partially caused by n flowing to the lake in addition n loadings regulate the distribution of denitrifying bacteria which is often indicated by functional genes for n2o production nirs and nirk and consumption nosz huang et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 high n flowing to eutrophic lakes increases algal growth potentially enhancing n2o emissions and n turnover rates yan et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 however the accumulation of algae alters the redox conditions favoring denitrification yan et al 2017 and more severe anoxic conditions limit the supply of nitrogen oxides generated by nitrification required for denitrification zhu et al 2020 these observations impede our understanding of the role of algae in n2o emissions such correlations in eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes have been extensively investigated lauerwald et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 however shallow lakes have been poorly studied in particular no studies have compared n2o emission fluxes among lakes of different trophic state salk and ostrom 2019 the trophic state of lakes leads to uncertainty in n2o emission estimates kortelainen et al 2020 yet the relationship between n2o emission fluxes and the trophic state of lakes is not entirely decoupled studies of the n2o emissions of lacustrine trophic states on a biogeographic scale could help enhance our understanding of their potential to act as sources of n2o emissions approximately 0 9 of china is covered with lakes there are a total of 2693 lakes 1 0 km2 about one third of which are shallow lakes located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin ma et al 2011 to enhance our understanding of the relationship between n2o emissions and eutrophication in shallow lakes in the yangtze river basin we characterized spatiotemporal variation in n2o emission fluxes and its underlying mechanisms in 17 lakes along a trophic state gradient at a biogeographic scale we constructed a model to predict the n2o emission patterns in shallow lakes of different trophic state the aims of this study were to i identify n2o emission patterns in shallow lakes of different trophic state ii characterize differences in the main microorganisms and functional genes for n2o emissions in the sediments in shallow lakes of different trophic state iii evaluate the relationship between environmental variables and n2o emissions to reveal the main drivers of n2o emissions and iv elucidate the role of algae on n2o emissions in shallow lakes the results of this study enhance our ability to accurately predict n2o emission patterns from shallow lakes 2 material and methods 2 1 field survey 2 1 1 lakes of different trophic state this study designated 17

n2o emission fluxes increased as the tli of lakes increased and the increase was more pronounced in hypertrophic lakes in addition n2o emission fluxes were predicted based on the ef5r eq 3 there was a nonlinear exponential relationship between the predicted n2o emission fluxes and tli adj r2 0 80 p 0 01 fig 2b these fluxes were higher than the observed values especially in the hyper eutrophic lakes in summer tli 70 fig s2 3 2 dissolved n2 concentration in shallow lakes mean dissolved n2 concentrations across all lakes in summer ranged from 403 3 μmol l 1 to 443 8 μmol l 1 and exhibited an unimodal relationship with tli fig 3 a among these examined lakes the lowest dissolved n2 concentration was observed in hyper eutrophic lakes there was a significant unimodal relationship between the dissolved n2 concentration and tli p 0 001 the excess dissolved n2 n2 which was obtained by subtracting dissolved n2 from the saturated concentration was consistently positive 8 1 16 1 μmol l 1 in summer indicating n2 oversaturation the trend of n2 oversaturation as a function of tli was consistent with dissolved n2 fig 3 3 3 relationship between environmental factors and n2o emission fluxes the pearson correlations between n2o emission fluxes and environmental parameters of the overlying water were analyzed in different seasons table s4 the n2o emission fluxes were significantly and positively correlated with tn no3 n and tli p 0 01 the correlation between chl a and n2o emission fluxes varied seasonally and the correlation was stronger in summer n2 was negatively correlated with n2o emission fluxes tn no3 n and chl a in summer p 0 05 there was a negative correlation between do concentrations and n2o emission fluxes p 0 05 in summer and this correlation was not observed in winter and over the entire year p 0 05 table s4 the overlying water do was higher in winter 7 mg l 1 than in summer fig s1b during the survey period the temperature of the overlying water ranged from 9 5 c to 15 1 c and 27 1 c to 31 3 c in winter and summer respectively fig s1c the temperature was negatively correlated with n2o emission fluxes in both summer and winter p 0 05 table s5 n2o emission fluxes showed significant and positive linear correlations with tn adj r2 0 797 p 0 01 in winter adj r2 0 908 p 0 01 in summer no3 n adj r2 0 787 p 0 01 in winter adj r2 0 826 p 0 01 in summer and nh4

a strong nonlinear correlation between n2o emission fluxes and the c n ratio adj r2 0 414 p 0 001 fig s5 a multiple stepwise regression model incorporating the physicochemical variables of the

strongly positively correlated with n2o emission fluxes than tp t2 2 93 which indicated that tn was an important parameter determining n2o emission fluxes in summer in addition tn chl a and no3 n could jointly predict n2o emission fluxes adj r2 0 96 p 0 001 in winter demonstrating that both tn 6 11 and chl a 6 56 are important parameters determining n2o emission fluxes in winter tn 12 83 and chl a 4 07 were important variables predicting n2o emission flux in lakes adj r2 0 86 p 0 01 3 4 microbial community structure and denitrifier abundances in lakes of different trophic state relative abundances of microbes were obtained at the phylum level in summer and winter fig 5 overall the top 15 phyla made up more than 80 of microbial communities in all lake sediments the following six phyla accounted for over 60 of the total population in summer proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes acidobacteria verrucomicrobia and planctomycetes those in the winter were proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria nitrospirae planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria which had relative abundances in hyper eutrophic middle eutrophic eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes of 30 6 44 2 32 3 42 4 31 8 39 9 and 32 0 46 4 respectively proteobacteria 26 4 43 4 was also common in all lakes in winter among the six dominant phyla the relative abundances of chloroflexi were 2 8 5 7 in winter and 4 7 15 9 in summer the relative abundances of nitrospirae were 2 3 9 7 in winter and 0 1 4 1 in summer the nirs gene abundances in winter 0 66 107 3 67 107 copies g 1 sediment were lower than those in summer 2 70 107 7 62 108 copies g 1 sediment fig s5 by contrast no significant difference was observed for nirk gene abundances in winter 0 36 107 2 29 107 copies g 1 sediment and summer 0 06 107 2 06 107 copies g 1 sediment the nirs nirk ratio was greater than 1 indicating that the nirs type denitrifiers were consistently more abundant than nirk type denitrifiers in these shallow lakes fig 6 a the ratios were 9 48 times higher in summer than in winter in addition the nirs nirk ratio increased as tli increased in summer and winter p 0 05 nirs nirk and n2o emission fluxes were also positively correlated fig s6a the abundance of nosz which encodes an enzyme for n2o consumption varied from 0 31 107 copies g 1 sediment to 2 88 107 copies g 1 sediment in winter which was lower than that in summer 0 53 107 7 02 107 copies g 1 sediment fig s5 variation in the ratios of nirk nirs nosz was lower among the shallow lakes in winter 0 8 9 5 than in summer 2 9 12 3 fig 6b the ratio of nirk nirs nosz was positively correlated with tli p 0 022 and n2o emission flux fig s6b further analysis revealed the relationship between the spatial distribution of these denitrifying genes and multiple environmental factors fig 7 a redundancy analysis rda showed that the first two axes explained 60 38 of the variation in the denitrifying genes the samples of the examined lakes were well separated among the different seasons the rda between the denitrifying gene abundances and environmental parameters indicated that temperature was an important factor affecting gene abundances among the tested parameters nirs and nosz abundances were sensitive to temperature compared with nirk the dissimilarity in the abundance of denitrifying genes in lakes of different trophic state was greater in summer than in winter the abundance of nirs was positively correlated with tli and the abundance of nosz was marginally correlated with tli 3 5 characterization of n2o emissions in the heavy algae accumulated and light algae accumulated zones in lake taihu the n loading and chl a concentrations were higher in the heavy algae accumulated zones zones a and b than in the light algae accumulated zone zone d table s2 the n2o emissions fluxes were characterized in summer and winter in the two typical zones in lake taihu the n2o emission fluxes were significantly higher in the heavy algae accumulated zones zones a and b and transitional zone zone c than in the light algae accumulated zone zone d the n2o emission fluxes were location dependent and varied from 42 16 to 136 63 μg m 2 h 1 in the heavy algae accumulated zones zones a and b 21 35 31 89 μg m 2 h 1 in the transitional zone zone c and 3 7 4 71 μg m 2 h 1 in the light algae accumulated zone zone d fig 8 these fluxes in the algae accumulated zones were significantly different in summer and winter p 0 05 and differences were not significant in zone c p 0 076 and zone d p 0 677 there was an exponential relationship between tli and n2o emission fluxes fig s7 adj r2 0 55 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 nonlinear n2o emission patterns shallow lakes are potential sources of n2o emissions and have been extensively studied kortelainen et al 2020 lauerwald et al 2019 mccrackin and elser 2011 previous studies have documented variation in n2o emissions across lakes of different trophic state kortelainen et al 2020 salk and ostrom 2019 nevertheless predicting n2o emission fluxes from shallow lakes remains a challenge this study showed that the net n2o emission fluxes in lakes located in the yangtze river basin which spans 1000 km displayed spatial and temporal heterogeneity determined by lake trophic state fig 2 consistent with previous studies salk and ostrom 2019 xiao et al 2019 zhou et al 2020c these findings indicate that eutrophic lakes in the yangtze river basin are sources of n2o emissions the patterns of n2o emission fluxes in the shallow lakes were not completely consistent with the results of previous studies and depended on eutrophication progress the n2o emission fluxes in the eutrophic and middle eutrophic lakes table s1 were similar to the global median value of n2o emission flux in lakes whereas the mean n2o emission flux in the hyper eutrophic lakes was 8 7 11 2 times higher than the global median value hu et al 2016 shallow lakes in a mesotrophic state in summer were n2o sinks fig 2 and table s1 these findings expand our knowledge regarding the prerequisites for freshwater lakes to act as either n2o sinks or sources lauerwald et al 2019 our study underscores the significance of lake trophic state in determining n2o emission fluxes which is supported by the correlation between net n2o emission flux and trophic state fig 2a whether lakes of different trophic state act as n2o sources or sinks can be predicted based on this correlation the major contribution of this study is the exponential model based on tli which could provide a robust means for quantifying lake trophic state this model can be used to predict the n2o emissions from lakes this model represents an improvement over previous approaches for estimating n2o emission fluxes because previous approaches do not consider differences in lake trophic state lauerwald et al 2019 this model can be used to assess n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes of different trophic state the n2o emission fluxes and tli were well fitted in summer adj r2 0 85 and winter adj r2 0 63 however the coefficient of determination was low adj r2 0 36 when all data i e summer and winter were incorporated into the model which is likely explained by the large differences in n2o emission fluxes in winter and summer fig 2 therefore seasonal differences in n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes should also receive consideration kortelainen et al 2020 miao et al 2020 given the limited data on seasonal differences and the limited number of shallow lakes investigated more data on n2o emission fluxes are required to verify the credibility of the model 4 2 potential drivers of n2o emissions our results revealed that reactive n accumulation plays a major role in regulating lake trophic state levels and the biological n cycle and promotes n2o emissions via denitrification in shallow lakes degradation and metabolism were similar among shallow lakes despite variation in trophic state proteobacteria was identified as a predominant phylum based on the 16s rrna gene analysis and it was commonly detected in lakes of different trophic state fig 5 li et al 2019b proteobacteria might potentially contribute to degradation and metabolism huang et al 2019 previous studies have indicated that copiotrophic groups such as proteobacteria and bacteroidetes with high growth rates tend to thrive in nutrient rich conditions fierer et al 2012 the overlying water and sediments likely stored abundant nutrients that could be used by microorganisms in shallow lakes in addition nutrient abundance is an important factor affecting the microorganisms responsible for n conversion saarenheimo et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the denitrifying genes varied greatly among the different trophic lakes and seasons figs 6 and s5 these results suggest that denitrification is an important source of n2o emissions in shallow eutrophic lakes which is consistent with the results of previous studies beaulieu et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 this is also confirmed by the stronger correlation of n2o emission flux with no3 than with nh4 fig 4 and the negative correlation between do and n2o emission fluxes table s4 the significant relationship between tli and nirk nirs nosz p 0 022 which indicates the relative abundance of n2o producers relative to n2o consumers suggests that n2o production may be greater than n2o consumption in hyper eutrophic lakes fig 6b zhao et al 2018 higher net n2o emission fluxes were observed in hyper eutrophic lakes because of their higher nutrient availability and nirk nirs nosz kortelainen et al 2020 these findings might explain the close relationship between lake trophic state and n2o emission flux n availability drives eutrophication and the subsequent accumulation of algae alters the redox conditions favoring denitrification yan et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 and increases n2o emissions in shallow lakes in freshwater ecosystems n loadings significantly contribute to n2o emissions via denitrification kortelainen et al 2020 mulholland et al 2008 which explains the high n2o emission fluxes observed in eutrophic lakes when n loading was high figs 2 and 4 a stepwise linear regression model indicated that tn and chl a algal density are important parameters explaining n2o emissions table 1 following algal accumulation algal decay alters redox conditions and releases organic matter in situ yan et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 moreover algal blooms result in low do concentrations and the accumulation of organic matter in hyper eutrophic lakes yan et al 2017 zhou et al 2020a zhu et al 2020 for example algal accumulation in lake taihu accounts for 50 of the organic matter xu et al 2019 a c n ratio lower than 8 indicates that organic matter is mainly derived from autochthonous inputs meyers 1994 yan et al 2017 the negative correlation between c n ratio and tli fig s3 indicates that algal accumulation and decomposition alter the physicochemical conditions in shallow lakes therefore the contribution of algal decomposition should receive increased consideration when exploring the relationship between n2o emission fluxes and chl a our results indicated that n2o emission fluxes and the c n ratio were negatively correlated p 0 001 fig s5 algal decomposition results in oxygen consumption and thus a low do concentration which is favorable for denitrification zhu et al 2020 this observation is consistent with the negative correlation between do and chl a tables s4 and s5 these findings might potentially explain the roles of decomposed algae in stimulating n2o emissions via consumed oxygen in eutrophic shallow lakes temperature is an important variable determining denitrifier abundance and structure in both seasons figs 6 and 7 the effect of temperature was also manifested by the differences in n2o emissions among seasons fig 2 this pattern is similar to a previous study of 87 boreal lakes in finland showing that n2o emissions peaked in winter kortelainen et al 2020 among enzymes responsible for denitrification n2o reductase is most sensitive to changes in temperature kortelainen et al 2020 veraart et al 2011 zhou et al 2020c our previous study indicated that nosz in n2o reducing bacteria is strongly related to temperature zhou et al 2020c in addition n2o reduction activity is inhibited by oxygen exposure which increases n2o emissions song et al 2019 low temperature increased the oxygen concentration fig s1 and the relationship between the ratio of nirs to nirk with tli varied in winter slope 0 08 and summer slope 1 11 p 0 05 fig 6a given that the algae in lakes gradually declined in winter concomitant with increasing do concentrations fig s1 and table s1 n2o emission fluxes in lakes increased in winter fig 2a miao et al 2020 in summer algal decay further decreased the oxygen concentration previous studies have shown that nirk only achieves high abundances in conditionally oxygen exposed environment huang et al 2011 whereas nirs genes have been more commonly detected in anoxic locations knapp et al 2009 the observation that the n2o emission fluxes nirs nirk and nirs nirk nosz showed more significant positive relationships in winter than in summer suggests that the n2o emission fluxes in summer were also affected by other factors fig s6 the dramatic difference between hyper eutrophic lakes in winter and summer was in the frequency of algal blooms in hyper eutrophic lakes in summer the algae regulating n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes are discussed in the subsequent section in sum low temperature associated with abundant n favored n2o accumulation via control oxygen concentrations and limit n2o reduction activity 4 3 dual impact of algae on n2o emissions n2o emissions were highest and the chl a concentration low in zone b in contrast to zone a in a heavy algae accumulated zone of lake taihu fig 8 and table s2 this result is inconsistent with the finding that algal accumulation reflected by tli stimulated n2o emissions in a non linear exponential manner in the other tested lakes fig s7 in heavy algae accumulated zones lower n2o emissions indicated by the high chl a concentration likely stem from algal accumulation which suppresses denitrification activities caused by the decrease in n2o production recently zhu et al 2020 reported that algal accumulation may inhibit denitrification during algal blooms in summer consistent with this finding a unimodal relationship between tli and excess dissolved n2 n2 in summer was observed fig 3b which indicated higher complete denitrification i e including n2o consumption rates in the eutrophic lakes chen et al 2014 wang et al 2018 in summer the highest gene abundances of nirk nirs and nosz were observed in eutrophic and middle eutrophic lakes rather than in hyper eutrophic lakes fig s5 although more abundant n is available in hyper eutrophic lakes the complete denitrification rates may be lower in hyper eutrophic lakes than in eutrophic lakes in summer this pattern potentially stems from the abundance of algal biomass in the hyper eutrophic lakes as release of algal debris eventually leads to reductive conditions table s2 the decay of excess algal biomass could create favorable conditions for denitrification where organic carbon is present under hypoxic or anoxic conditions however hypoxia limits nitrification which leads to a deficiency in the supply of no3 for denitrification small et al 2014 zhu et al 2020 this effect is supported by previous work in zones with accumulated algae in lake taihu showing that the nh4 concentration in sediments is two or three orders of magnitude higher than the no3 concentration yan et al 2019 our results are also consistent with this observation table s2 in addition chl a as a negative factor and tn together predicted the n2o emission fluxes table 1 algal accumulation and decomposition create hypoxic conditions that limit nitrification by converting nh4 into no3 eventually suppressing the ensuing denitrification in addition hypoxic conditions favor complete denitrifying bacteria for mitigating n2o emissions these results further explain why higher n2o emission fluxes of shallow lakes were observed in winter rather than in summer figs 2a and 8 therefore these evidences indicated that algal accumulation played a dual role in stimulating and impeding n2o emissions especially in hyper eutrophic lakes 4 4 implications of eutrophication progress on n2o emissions in aquatic ecosystems excessive n loadings drive eutrophication and promote n2o emissions in water bodies zhao et al 2015 meanwhile the nutrient overload induces algae growth in shallow lakes forming an anoxic or microaerobic micro environment favoring n2o production by algae accumulation zhu et al 2020 in this study a nonlinear exponential increase in n2o emission flux as a function of tli in shallow lakes of different trophic state was observed fig 2 eutrophic lakes had high n2o emission fluxes which is consistent with the relationship between lake trophic state and ch4 emission fluxes zhou et al 2020a the common trends indicate that increases in ghg emissions stem from eutrophication the predicted n2o emission fluxes based on the ipcc ef5r overestimated the observed fluxes but also exhibited a non linear exponential increase with tli fig 2b xiao et al 2019 reported that the n2o emission factor in lake taihu was 0 18 which is lower than the value of ef5r based on the reported ipcc value the overestimation by the ipcc default value indicates the need to calibrate an n2o emission factor in shallow lakes depending on the eutrophic state pronounced differences between the predicted and observed n2o emission fluxes were observed in hyper eutrophic lakes where the abundance of algae impeded n2o emissions the high abundance of algae in summer compared with winter indicates that the degree to which n2o emission flux was overestimated in summer was different from that in winter fig s2 algal decomposition made the redox conditions favorable for denitrification but unfavorable for nitrification because of an insufficient supply of no3 the retained nitrogen is absorbed by the newly grown algae zhu et al 2020 in non limited n algal decay leads to low oxygen conditions which enhances denitrification and further stimulates n2o emissions therefore algae should be considered a n pool that maintains nitrogen in lakes in such situations where algae pools n lower n2o emissions stemming from the suppression of nitrification do not contribute to the reduction in global n2o emissions from lakes but potentially leads to substantial n2o emissions from hyper eutrophic state lakes when conditions for nitrification are suitable we suggest that overestimation was possibly caused by the dual role of the algae because they help re regulate denitrification to mitigate n2o emissions estimation of flux by the two layer model was one order of magnitude lower than that estimated by static chamber methods duchemin et al 1999 given that the two different methods plausibly overestimated or underestimated the n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes an intensive survey of an n2o emission factor in hyper eutrophic lakes will be conducted in a follow up study 5 conclusions we performed a series of field measurements and characterized the n2o emissions in shallow lakes of different trophic state in the yangtze river basin the results of this study are detailed below the n2o emission fluxes of shallow lakes were most strongly affected by lake trophic state suggesting that estimation of n2o emission fluxes should consider lake trophic state the nonlinear model incorporating trophic state levels can describe the n2o emissions from a shallow lake the predicted n2o emission fluxes based on the ipcc ef5r overestimated the observed fluxes particularly those in hyper eutrophic lakes nutrient rich conditions and algal accumulation were key factors determining n2o emission fluxes in shallow lakes and algal accumulation played a dual role in stimulating and impeding n2o emissions especially in hyper eutrophic lakes changes in season accompanied the appearance and disappearance of algae and altered n2o emission fluxes especially in hyper eutrophic lakes declaration of competing interest the
