21625,this paper investigates the low frequency lf surge motion of a semi submersible platform in storm sea states without current where the influence of viscous drag forces on the lf surge motions is focused four hydrodynamic models including one potential flow panel model and three panel and morison s hybrid models were established lf surge motion was calculated in time domain using aqwa five sea conditions were considered including two relatively small sea states one moderate sea state and two storm sea states under each sea condition four sets of drag coefficient in the morison s model were used for calculation by comparing mean offset extreme offset and standard deviation of lf surge motion between different hydrodynamic models in different sea states the influence of morison s elements above still water level swl or below swl drag coefficient and sea states were investigated by comparing numerical results with model test results it is concluded that the drag forces on morison s elements below swl is the major source of platform viscous damping forces while the drag forces on morison s elements above swl is the major source of viscous drift forces which provide an important contribution to the mean and extreme offset of the platform lf surge motion under storm sea conditions keywords semi submersible storm sea states viscous drag force low frequency surge motion morison s equation drag coefficient 1 introduction the north sea region is rich in oil resources but its sea conditions are quite challenging wave heights higher than 30 m can occur in the north sea region faltinsen 1993 several mooring line failure incidents in worse weather have been reported on north sea movable offshore drilling units and fpso s during recent years kvitrud 2014 experimental and theoretical studies show that viscous effects on drift force are particular significant for column stabilized platforms in high waves yang et al 2017 however the presently mostly used hydrodynamic analysis software based on three dimensional potential flow theory neglects the viscosity in their theoretical formulation thus the calculated potential drift force fails to consider the influence of viscosity which could lead to the underestimation of the drift forces and the drift motion under storm sea states and the mooring line breaking may occur dev and pinkster 1994 studied the viscous contribution of the mean drift forces on vertical cylinders pointing out that the splash zone of the vertical columns is the major source of the viscous contributions in waves even without currents the splash zone means the part of platform column that interfaces with the wave elevation during the crest and trough phases berthelsen et al 2009 studied the surge motion of a semi submersible in high sea states and compare the numerical results with model test results pointing out that drift forces in moderate and short waves are predicted reasonably well by diffraction analysis in longer waves such as in typical storm sea states viscous drift forces and viscous damping forces increase and can become dominant stansberg et al 2015 considered the viscous effect and wave current interaction effect on the mean wave drift force and proposed a semi empirical formula to correct the potential flow mean wave drift force of semi submersible platform under storm sea conditions this formula can improve the mooring line tension prediction results and was generalized by yang et al 2017 to non collinear wave current conditions yang et al 2017 2018 used two methods to simulate the viscous drift force and viscous damping force of semi submersible platforms under storm sea conditions in the first method the viscous drift force and viscous damping force are simulated using the drag term in morison s equation and the relative velocity in drag term uses the total relative velocity which means the relative velocity between wave current and structure the drag force is integrated up to the instantaneous free surface in the second method the viscous damping force is simulated by drag term in morison s equation using the relative velocity between the structure and current while the viscous drift force is simulated by correcting the potential flow mean wave drift force coefficient using the generalized semi empirical formula in the case of high sea conditions and the presence of currents both models can achieve ideal numerical results compared with model test fonseca and stansberg 2018 calibrated a time domain numerical hydrodynamic model to predict the motion of a semi submersible in high sea states with current in order to achieve numerical time series predictions in good agreement with the model test results they adjusted the hydrodynamic coefficients used for time domain calculation finally they found that the un calibrated numerical model can predict wave frequency motions very well even in high sea states but for lf motions they found that lf wave drift forces quadratic damping coefficients and added mass need increase in high sea states in particular with current also fonseca et al 2018 studied wave drift force coefficients of four different semi submersibles in severe sea states with collinear current the wave drift force coefficients were identified from model tests using a second order signal analysis technique based on cross bi spectral analysis the study shows that good agreement between potential flow drift force coefficients and identified drift force coefficients in small sea states for all four semis but the results show large underestimation of the potential flow drift force coefficients at the low frequency range at a severe sea state especially for the semis with small columns diameter meanwhile they found that currents effects tend to increase the wave drift forces at the low frequency range in this paper the method used by yang et al 2017 is adopted to model the viscous drift force and viscous damping force based on this method this paper further investigates the effect of morison s elements above still water level swl or below swl drag coefficient cd selection and sea states on mean offset extreme offset and standard deviation of low frequency lf surge motion which are not presented and discussed in the paper of yang et al 2017 2018 the study provides a better understanding of hydrodynamic forces and drift motions characteristics of semi submersible in storm sea states in section 2 motion equations modelling method of viscous wave loads using morison s equation is introduced the model test and numerical model are described in section 3 section 4 analyzed and discussed the numerical results in detail and the conclusions are drawn finally 2 the motion equations and hydrodynamic modelling for the semi submersible platform 2 1 the motion equations of semi submersible in waves the motion equations of the floating structure in waves is expressed as follows 1 m a x t 0 t r t τ x τ d τ k x t b w x τ f w 1 t f w 2 t f m f d where m is the structural mass matrix a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency for the platform r t τ is the radiation fluid loads retardation function matrix k is the hydrostatic restoring force coefficient matrix b w is the wave drift damping coefficient f w 1 is the first order wave excitation force f w 2 is the second order low frequency wave excitation force f m is the restoring force from mooring system f d is the fluid viscosity induced hydrodynamic loads on the platform which cannot be ignored for the semi submersible platform in severe sea conditions in this paper the motion equations for the semi submersible is solved using aqwa drift module in time domain the radiation fluid force due to platform motions is expressed using the convolution integral of the fluid loads retardation function and the platform motion velocity where the retardation function is obtained using the fourier transformation of wave damping coefficients the added mass wave damping coefficients first order wave forces and second order mean drift forces are calculated using three dimensional potential flow panel method faltinsen 1993 in aqwa line module the wave drift damping coefficients is obtained using the aranha s formula aranha 1996 in aqwa drift the second order low frequency wave excitation force is calculated using the newman s approximation newman 1974 for the mooring forces presently the linear elastic rope is used to simulate the mooring system and the quasi static method is used for calculation in aqwa drift for the viscous fluid loads on the platform they are modeled by the drag term in morison s equation morison et al 1950 because currently the viscous effect from the columns and pontoons of the platform is focused in the following section the form of the morison s equations is introduced firstly 2 2 the drag forces modelling using morison s equation the semi submersible platform is mostly composed of cylindrical members and when the incoming wave length is long they can be treated as slender members journée and massie 2001 the wave force acting on the slender member can be calculated using morison s equation 2 where the first term represents the drag force and last two terms represent the inertial force 2 d f 1 2 ρ d c d u f u s u f u s ρ a 1 c a u f ρ a c a u s where c d is the drag coefficient c a is the added mass coefficient d is the characteristic drag diameter u f represents the current strength and usually has two forms total velocity including waves and currents and current only while current dominating the fluid particle velocity u s is the structure velocity normal to the slender members and a is the cross sectional area for a member with a rectangular cross section the right handed local coordinate system is established as shown in fig 1 and morison s equation can be expressed by eqs 3 and 4 3 d f y 1 2 ρ d y c d y u f u s u f y u s y ρ a 1 c a y u f y ρ a c a u s y 4 d f z 1 2 ρ d z c d z u f u s u f z u s z ρ a 1 c a z u f z ρ a c a u s z the subscripts of variables in eqs 3 and 4 represent their values in y axis direction and z axis direction respectively for example in fig 1 the width b and height h of the rectangular section can be selected as d y and d z separately it is noted that in eqs 2 4 the drag forces are represented due to the relative velocity between the fluid particles and the structure in this paper the hybrid model of potential panel model and morison s model is used to predict the wave loads on semi submersible platform the inertial force is calculated by the panel model and thus only the drag force term in eqs 2 4 are used to simulate the viscous loads which includes both the fluid loads induced wave excitation force and damping force 2 3 the viscous mean drift force on a fixed column in regular waves without current the drag force term in morison s equation is used to simulate the viscous drift force and viscous damping force which cannot be computed through the potential theory it was studied by faltinsen 1993 that the viscous effect induced mean drift forces is of third order which means it is proportional to the cubic of the wave amplitude in regular waves for a semi submersible platform due to the nonlinear drag forces induced by the relative motions between the incident wave and platforms the viscous drag forces can be generated both on the underwater pontoons and the columns at the water splashing regions in the following how the viscous mean drift forces originate from viscous drag effect is illustrated on fixed column in regular waves according to the linear airy wave theory the incident wave potential at infinite water depth can be written as 5 φ ζ a g ω e k z cos ω t k x the velocity expression of the fluid particle in horizontal direction is 6 u φ x ω ζ a e k z sin ω t k x where ζ a is regular wave amplitude ω is circular wave frequency and k is wave number for the velocity of wave particle in the splash zone the linear wave theory is not accurate because its boundary condition satisfies at z 0 if we assume that the velocity of fluid particle equal to the velocity of fluid particle at z 0 then the fluid particle velocity profile at the axis of column can be expressed as shown in fig 2 the drag force on fixed column in regular waves can be calculated by the following equation 7 f d h ζ x d f d ρ 2 c d d ω 2 ζ a 2 sin ω t k x sin ω t k x h 0 e 2 k z d z 0 ζ x d z the average of sin ω t k x sin ω t k x h 0 e 2 k z d z in eq 7 is zero in one wave period thus the viscous mean drift force is mainly from the splash zone the viscous mean drift force can be expressed as 8 f d ρ 2 c d d ω 2 ζ a 3 1 t 0 t sin 2 ω t k x sin ω t k x d t ρ 4 π c d d ω 2 ζ a 3 1 3 cos 3 k x 3 cos k x it can be seen in eq 8 that the viscous mean drift force in the wave splash zone is proportional to the cube of wave amplitude and the potential mean drift force is proportional to the square of wave amplitude therefore with wave amplitude increasing the viscous mean drift force will become more and more important from eq 8 it seems that the viscous drift forces follow the direction of wave propagation while it is not necessary the direction of the viscous drift forces on the freely floating semi submersible platform in such cases it should be noted that the viscous mean drift forces on the platform could be in line with or on the opposite to the wave propagation direction which depends on phase angle between the platform motions and the wave motions faltinsen 1993 3 model test introduction and numerical model for exwave semi submersible in order to improve the current numerical methods procedures and standard industry practice in prediction of extreme mooring line loads the exwave jip joint industry project was initiated and harbin engineering university participated it based on the semi submersible s model and model test data in this project the analysis of the drift motion of the platform under severe sea conditions is carried out 3 1 primary particulars of exwave semi submersible the exwave semi submersible platform in the exwave jip project is used in this paper the platform consists of two pontoons four square shaped columns with rounded corners four diagonal braces and two cross braces the platform model is shown in fig 3 the platform model has a scale ratio of 1 50 and an operation water depth of 3 m 150 m in full scale primary particulars of full scale exwave semi submersible are shown in table 1 3 2 exwave semi submersible panel model and morison s model the hydrodynamic analysis of the platform is performed using three dimension potential flow theory with constant panel method the right handed global earth fixed coordinate system o xyz is defined in fig 4 the coordinate origin is located at the symmetric center on the swl the x axis is pointing to the bow and the z axis is pointing upwards three sets of exwave semi submersible platform panel model was established in aqwa as shown in fig 4 the number of mesh grid are 1702 3502 and 5000 separately since we focus on the lf surge motion the results of added mass coefficient μ 11 radiation wave damping coefficient λ 11 first order wave force amplitude f x 1 and mean wave drift coefficient f x 2 with different number of panels are shown in fig 5 it is found that the numerical results have good convergence among three panel models thus the frequency domain results of panel model with 1702 panels were used for the remaining hydrodynamic analysis of the semi submersible in irregular waves in order to represents the viscous loads on the platform in severe sea state the morison s drag model is used in aqwa the morison s model is established by the stub method the stub method permits elements of non circular cross section to be modeled eq 3 and eq 4 presents the calculation formula of stub morison s elements as shown in figs 6 8 three different morison s model has been used in order to study the effect of viscous loads on the lf surge motion of the platform morison s model 1 in fig 6 only establishes morison s elements below swl which means that only the drag force from the structural members below the swl at rest is considered morison s model 2 in fig 7 establishes morison s elements all through the vertical columns and the remaining structural members which means that the drag force is considered including all the possible structural members below the instantaneous incident wave surface morison s model 3 in fig 8 only establishes morison s elements above swl this model is obviously unreasonable and it is mainly used for numerical investigation of the effect of the contribution of different viscous loads components compared those from morison s models 1 and 2 it should be noted that in order to avoid duplicate calculations of the inertial forces from the panel method and the empirical morison s model only the drag force term in the morison s formula is retained the direction of arrow in figs 6 8 represents the local coordinate system x axis direction of the morison s element the local y axis direction is given in table 2 proposed by nestgard et al 2017 and the local z axis direction can be determined according to the right handed rule when eqs 2 4 are used to model the drag forces of the platform the drag coefficient cd needs to be determined first it is known that cd for oscillatory flows is dependent on the kc number for the actual platform motions in irregular waves it is expected that the kc number will change from wave to wave and from lf cycle to lf cycle therefore the cd value will be changed on different location of the semi submersible and depend on the sea state and motion as well the focus of this paper is to investigate the effect of the viscous loads from morison s elements strictly speaking the best way to determine the appropriate drag coefficients is via physical model test which depends on not only the section geometry but also the kc number while because the geometrical sections like the column and pontoon have various types of geometry there is still no enough model test data available therefore the drag coefficient cd is determined based on the cross section shape of each morison s element as shown in fig 9 according to the recommended value in dnv rp c205 in fig 10 the selected drag coefficients are shown in table 2 by referring to the work of nestgard et al 2017 the meaning of cdy dy cdz and dz has been explained in eqs 3 4 except as listed in table 2 e1 element also has a drag coefficient c dx 1 0 in the local x direction to simulate the longitudinal drag force from the end of the pontoon and the characteristic length d x is taken as the pontoon width for morison s elements e2 and e3 in fig 9 because the section shape of these elements is neither rectangle with four rounded corners nor rectangle the flow separation of this section shape is severer than that of the rectangle with rounded corner shape type but smaller than that of the rectangle shape type for example if the section shape of e2 is rectangle l d 0 68 r d 0 then the cdz should be about 2 4 if the section shape of e2 is rectangle with rounder corner l d 0 68 r d 0 21 then the cdz should be 1 5 here nestgard et al 2017 directly choose the drag coefficient for rectangle shaped section the situation is the same for cdz of e2 morison s element for e3 element it has the same section shape with e2 however e3 locates at the junction of pontoon and column and the diffraction phenomenon is not obvious thus it was recommended by nestgard et al 2017 to apply a reduction factor of 0 5 at junctions between columns and pontoons cdz 0 5 2 4 1 2 cdy 0 5 1 9 0 95 for morison s elements e5 e6 and e9 the cd coefficient can be chosen according to the dnv rp c205 using linear interpolation method from the available data table for example for e6 and e9 elements l d 1 0 r d 0 25 then the cdy cdz 1 1 for braces e7 and e8 drag coefficients for circular cross sections can be applied the hybrid models used in this paper are the combination of the panel model and the morison s model the hybrid model 1 is the combination of the panel model and the morison s model 1 the hybrid model 2 is the combination of the panel model and the morison s model 2 the hybrid model 3 is the combination of the panel model and the morison s model 3 the main difference between panel model hybrid model 1 hybrid model 2 and hybrid model 3 is the modelling method of viscous effect as shown in table 3 3 3 mooring system in the model test the mooring system consists of four mooring lines and the angle between the mooring lines is 90 which is symmetrically distributed during the model test one end of the mooring line was hung on the basin wall above the water surface and the other end was suspended on the model so that most mooring lines were above the water surface the purpose of this is to remove the effects of the hydrodynamic loads from mooring system on the platform the pull out test has been conducted in aqwa in order to check the restoring force in surge direction as shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the simulation result is close to the model test result and the restoring force of the mooring system is almost linear the restoring force stiffness in surge direction is about 157 kn m the surge natural period of the semi submersible platform obtained in aqwa is 119 3s and the model test value is 116 8s 3 4 model test conditions the sea states studied in this paper all use the torsethaugen wave spectrum which is a two parameter wave spectrum and is suitable for the simulation of the north sea state in norway the significant wave height hs and peak period tp of each sea state are shown in table 4 all the model test conditions used here are given in head seas 4 analysis of semi submersible lf surge motion in the aqwa drift the incident wave time series measured in the model test is used as an input the calculation time step is 0 7 s and the number of calculation steps is 18 000 steps in order to reduce the influence of the transient response at the initial time moment and assure the statistical value more accurate and reliable the numerical results for the low frequency lf surge motion between 1000s and 11800s is used for the statistical value analysis firstly the statistical value time series and power spectral density psd comparison for lf surge motion of the numerical results from hybrid model 2 using c d in table 2 and the model test are given in table 5 figs 12 14 the negative sign in table 5 represents the direction which is on the contrary of the positive direction of x axis and the extreme offset refers to the maximum deviation of the platform from the initial position along the wave propagation direction for convenience the mean offset and the extreme offset in fig 12 are taken as the absolute values it can be seen from table 5 that numerical results of lf surge motion mean offset extreme offset and standard deviation generally compare well with model test results except that the mean offset is overestimated by 30 3 in test no 4060 the extreme offset is overestimated by 18 86 in test no 4040 for psd results it is found that the peak value of tests no 4020 4050 and 4060 compare well with that of model tests while the peak value of tests no 4030 and 4040 is smaller than that of model tests meanwhile both the numerical and model test shows that the peak frequency of test 4060 psd moves to the lower frequency compared with that from the other test no it means that the natural surge frequency changes to lower frequency at severe sea state the phenomena is found by fonseca and stansberg 2018 at present the morison s drag force is used to represent the viscous wave loads where the viscous damping level is varied among different sea state therefore it can be deduced that the change of the natural surge frequency is due to the viscous damping effect which can influence the natural frequency of the dynamic surge motion in the following to further improve the numerical models the effects of different hybrid models and the drag coefficient cd settings on the mean drift motions extreme offset and standard deviation of the drift surge motion are discussed in sections 4 1 4 3 4 1 analysis of the influences of different hybrid models and viscous drag coefficients on mean drift surge motion the lf surge motion of the platform is calculated in the time domain and mean offset obtained by the potential flow panel model hybrid model 1 and hybrid model 2 are compared which are shown in tables 6 and 7 figs 15 and 16 the drag coefficient c d in surge direction is reduced to certain value in order to study the influence of c d on lf surge motion c d dnv in table 6 indicates that the drag coefficients are selected from table 2 according to the dnv rp c205 c d 0 2 means that the drag coefficient of each morison s element in surge direction is reduced by 0 2 based on the coefficients in table 2 presently the drag coefficient in surge direction includes 1 the drag coefficients in local y direction of the e5 e6 e7 e8 and e9 morison s elements 2 the drag coefficient in local x direction of the e1 morison s element in figs 15 and 16 it is observed that the mean offset result decrease with the reduction of surge drag coefficient c d the variation of the mean offset has a linear relationship with the variation of c d which can be analyzed from tables 6 and 7 under each sea state the mean offset result calculated by potential flow theory is lower than the model test result and can be improved evidently by considering the viscous drift contribution from morison s elements the external forces that cause the mean offset of the platform primarily include the potential wave drift force and the viscous mean drift force from morison s drag elements the viscous mean drift force mainly consists of two aspects 1 the average of the viscous drift force from the pontoons is not zero in one wave period 2 the average of viscous drift force of morison s elements around the free surface splash zone is not zero in one wave period neither the reason why the average value from the splash zone is not zero is that the portion of the column near the free surface is sometimes out of water and sometimes in the water causing the average viscous drag force to be non zero in one wave period besides the mean viscous drift force is proportional to the drag coefficient c d eq 8 therefore the mean viscous drift force decreases with the reduction of c d from tables 6 and 7 figs 15 and 16 it can be found that the platform shows larger negative mean offset considering the viscous drift forces than the value obtained based on the potential flow model it means that in the present cases the viscous mean drift forces have the consistent contribution with the mean drift forces from potential flow theory it is also observed that with the same drag coefficient c d the variation of mean offset calculated by hybrid model 2 is much larger than that calculated by hybrid model it is suggested that the upper portion of the cylinder above swl has a quite significant contribution on the total viscous mean drift forces especially for the severer sea states test no 4040 and 4060 it is found from figs 15 and 16 that mean offset surge motion are dependent on the values of cd especially at higher sea states according to the research by dev and pinkster 2001 it is concluded that the morison s elements at the wave splashing region is the main source of viscous drift force compared with the contribution from the pontoons which contribute to the mean surge offset based on figs 6 and 7 it is seen that the calm water line is on the upper end of the morison s element e6 therefore the morison s element e6 and e9 contributes a lot to the mean drift force it means that the drag coefficient for e6 and e9 is very important for properly estimating the viscous drift forces it is seen from fig 16 that the best cd coefficient to get the best agreement with the model test from different test no is different generally the drag coefficient value taken about 0 9 for e6 and e9 morison s element are the best choice for all the test no except test no 4060 where the drag coefficient taken about 0 5 achieves the best agreement for the numerical mean offset compared with the model test in order to investigate the influences of the upper portion of the cylinder above swl on the total viscous mean drift forces and the mean drift surge motions the numerical results of the mean drift surge motion using the hybrid model 3 is provided in table 8 and fig 17 it is seen that the mean drift surge motion using the cd dnv drag coefficient from hybrid model 3 reduced compared with the results from hybrid model 2 because the viscous drift forces from the structural members below the swl is not considered while these numerical results remain the same level of value with the results from hybrid model 1 it shows that the structural members above the swl has important contribution to the total viscous drift forces 4 2 analysis of the influences of different hybrid models and viscous drag coefficients on extreme drift surge motion tables 9 and 10 provide extreme offset results calculated by hybrid model 1 and hybrid model 2 respectively figs 18 and 19 show the bar chart of these results it is observed that potential flow results largely overestimate the extreme values except test no 4060 the reason is that in the potential flow results the viscous loads including the viscous damping on the columns and pontoons are neglected which is actually the main source of the fluid damping on decreasing the resonant surge motion when lf surge motion is simulated using only the potential flow fluid loads the fluid damping has been significantly underestimated therefore the potential flow results largely overestimate the extreme values in hybrid model 1 results the extreme offset increases with the reduction of c d under all sea states however in hybrid model 2 results with the reduction of c d model test case 4020 results increase model test cases 4030 and 4050 results change a little model test cases 4040 and 4060 results decrease firstly the calculation results corresponding to model test no 4060 are focused fig 18 clearly shows that the extreme offset using hybrid model 1 changes quite small with the reduction of drag coefficient c d around at 18 60 m which is 3 7 m smaller than the model test result extreme result calculated by potential flow theory is smaller than the model test result too however in the calculation result of hybrid model 2 the extreme offset prediction result has been significantly improved this also can be shown by the comparison of psd results of test no 4060 c d dnv between hybrid model 1 and hybrid model 2 as shown in fig 20 the peak value of psd using hybrid model 2 is closer to that of the model test fig 19 shows that the extreme offset decrease with the reduction of drag coefficient c d and is close to the model test result this indicates that morison s elements above swl have an important contribution to the prediction of extreme offset in model test no 4060 which represents the storm sea state in fig 19 for the calculation results of hybrid model 2 with the reduction of c d the extreme offset of model test cases 4040 and 4060 decreases while the extreme offset of model test cases 4020 4030 and 4050 increases the reason may be that the incident wave heights of model test cases 4020 4030 and 4050 are relatively small thus the viscous drag force on morison s elements above swl have relatively small contribution to the platform drift motion as a result the extreme offset result using hybrid model 2 should have the same trend with that using hybrid model 1 on the other hand the incident wave height of model test 4040 and model test 4060 is higher so the viscous drag force of morison s elements above swl play an important role and indispensable to the wave excitation force of drift motion as a consequence the extreme offset decreases with the reduction of c d in model test no 4040 4060 instead of increasing with the reduction of c d from the above analysis it seems that the morison s elements located above and below swl have the opposite contribution to the prediction of extreme offset that means the extreme offset will increase with the reduction of c d of morison s elements below swl and decrease with the reduction of c d of morison s elements above swl in model test no 4040 and 4060 with the reduction of c d the reduction of the extreme offset caused by the reduction of c d of morison s elements above swl is larger than the increase caused by the reduction of c d of morison s elements below swl finally the extreme offset will decrease with the reduction of c d to further investigate the influences of the morison s elements modelling the hybrid model 3 in the previous section is still used and the calculated results are compared with the potential flow panel model to study the contribution of morison s elements around the swl to the extreme offset the results are shown in table 11 and fig 21 it can be seen in fig 21 that for model test 4020 4030 and 4050 the extreme results calculated by hybrid model 3 is close to the results calculated by potential panel model the maximum relative differences are about 5 2 model test no 4050 dnv drag coefficients besides the extreme result changes small with the reduction of c d in model test cases 4020 and 4030 this indicates that viscous drag force on morison s elements above swl has quite small contribution to the prediction of drift motion extreme offset under moderate or small sea states whereas for model test no 4040 and 4060 the extreme offset decreases with the reduction of c d the difference between hybrid model 3 and panel model extreme offset results is evident especially model test no 4060 this reveals that morison s elements above swl has relatively larger influence on the extreme drift offset motion under storm sea states fig 18 clearly show that extreme offset results of hybrid model 1 are generally lower than model test results especially for model test 4030 4050 and 4060 while extreme results calculated by hybrid model 2 except for the model test 4040 compare well with model test results therefore it is reasonable to choose hybrid model 2 as the computational model for extreme surge drift motion prediction by comparing extreme offset results calculated by potential flow panel model and hybrid model 1 2 and 3 how viscous drag force from morison s elements above and below swl influence the surge drift motion can be discussed from eq 2 it is shown that the viscous drag force includes viscous drift force and viscous damping force the viscous drift force is more related to the horizontal wave velocity and the viscous damping force is more related to the velocity of the structural elements since the horizontal wave velocity reaches the largest at the free surface viscous drag force on morison s elements above swl have more contribution to the viscous drift force of the platform which can increase the mean offset and extreme offset prediction of the platform besides larger c d will give larger viscous drift force which causes the larger mean offset and extreme offset prediction while morison s elements below swl have smaller contribution to the viscous drift force as the wave velocity decrease exponentially with the depth increases morison s elements below swl have more contribution to the slowly varying surge damping because the wetted surface of morison s elements below swl is much larger than morison s elements above swl including the morison s elements below swl provide the necessary viscous drift damping of the platform and help to reduce the extreme offset of the platform s surge drift motion the larger the drag coefficient c d is the greater the reduction of the extreme offset of the drift motion presently the drag coefficients are determined from the sectional shape only it is seen that the morison s elements around the splash zone contribute largely to the viscous exciting force it is observed from fig 19 that the determined drag coefficients according to the dnv rp c205 achieve the good results of the extreme offset in general in severe sea conditions as test no 4040 and 4060 it is possible to use smaller drag coefficient at the wave splash zone than that determined by the rp rule to get better numerical results 4 3 analysis of the influences of different hybrid models and viscous drag coefficients on standard deviation of surge drift motion the standard deviation reflects the degree of deviation of platform s drift motion from the mean offset tables 12 and 13 show calculation results of the standard deviation using hybrid model 1 and hybrid model 2 figs 22 and 23 present the bar chart of these results in model test case no 4060 using hybrid model 2 the standard deviation decreases with the reduction of the drag coefficient c d while for the other cases listed in tables 12 and 13 the standard deviation increases with the reduction of the drag coefficient c d the standard deviations calculated through potential flow theory are much larger than the model test results or hybrid model 1 and 2 results as the potential flow theory ignores the viscous damping force which provides nearly almost the damping to restrain the platform lf resonant surge motion at present the calculations in model test no 4060 using hybrid model 1 with different c d are generally smaller than the experimental value while results calculated using hybrid model 2 are generally larger than the experimental value in general the results using hybrid model 2 demonstrates better agreement with the model test results in order to investigate the influence of morison s elements above or below swl on the standard deviation of drift motion hybrid model 3 is used and the calculations are shown in fig 24 and table 14 from the results we can see that for model test no 4020 4030 and 4050 the standard deviation increases with the reduction of c d while in model test 4040 and 4060 the standard deviation decreases with the reduction of c d compared with results of hybrid model 2 including morison s elements above and below swl hybrid model 3 only including morison s elements above swl results are generally much larger besides hybrid model 3 results are much larger than model test results this indicates that morison s elements below swl are the major source of viscous drift motion damping it can also be concluded from fig 23 that the determined drag coefficients according to the dnv rp c205 could get the good results for the standard deviation 5 conclusion in this paper the lf surge motion of the semi submersible platform in irregular head wave was studied and numerical simulation results were compared with model test results to find out the motion characteristics in storm sea states the differences between results from the potential panel model and three hybrid models combined potential panel and morison s models under relatively small model test cases 4020 4030 moderate model test case 4050 and storm sea conditions model test cases 4040 4060 were discussed the main conclusions are as follows 1 for mean drift surge motions the mean offset can be improved evidently by considering the viscous drag induced drift forces contribution from morison s elements the mean drift motion is proportional to the drag coefficient c d and decreases with the reduction of c d under storm sea conditions the contribution of viscous effect on the mean drift force is very important 2 for extreme offset results both morison s elements above swl and below swl have contribution morison s elements below swl have more contribution to the viscous damping force the extreme offset increases with the reduction of c d of morison s elements below swl in hybrid model 1 see fig 18 however morison s elements above swl have more contribution to the viscous drift force the extreme offset will decrease with the reduction of c d of morison s elements above swl in hybrid model 3 see fig 21 under storm sea conditions morison s elements above swl is important for the prediction of extreme offset if morison s elements above swl are ignored the adjustment of c d will have little effect on the extreme offset results see fig 18 and the extreme offsets will be smaller than the model test results in this paper the extreme offset results that agree well to the model test result under storm sea conditions can be predicted by using hybrid model 2 3 for standard deviation results the viscous drift force on morison s elements above swl also has an important contribution if this contribution is ignored the standard deviations under different c d are generally smaller than the model test results 4 at present research c d is assumed to be independent of the sea state from the numerical statistical results of lf surge motion it is found that using drag coefficients recommended by dnv rp c205 generally provides good results of the statistical value compared with model test data it should be mentioned that the form of the morison s formula may affect this conclusion presently it is obtained using morison s drag model in terms of the total relative velocity under irregular wave conditions it can also be found that the adjustment of the drag coefficient can achieve better results especially under storm sea state for the present test nos 4040 and 4060 the smaller drag coefficient of the columns compared with that from dnv rp c205 provide better results for the mean offset and extreme offset where the mean offset is more sensitive to the input value of the drag coefficient at wave splashing region credit authorship contribution statement shan ma conceptualization methodology

21625,this paper investigates the low frequency lf surge motion of a semi submersible platform in storm sea states without current where the influence of viscous drag forces on the lf surge motions is focused four hydrodynamic models including one potential flow panel model and three panel and morison s hybrid models were established lf surge motion was calculated in time domain using aqwa five sea conditions were considered including two relatively small sea states one moderate sea state and two storm sea states under each sea condition four sets of drag coefficient in the morison s model were used for calculation by comparing mean offset extreme offset and standard deviation of lf surge motion between different hydrodynamic models in different sea states the influence of morison s elements above still water level swl or below swl drag coefficient and sea states were investigated by comparing numerical results with model test results it is concluded that the drag forces on morison s elements below swl is the major source of platform viscous damping forces while the drag forces on morison s elements above swl is the major source of viscous drift forces which provide an important contribution to the mean and extreme offset of the platform lf surge motion under storm sea conditions keywords semi submersible storm sea states viscous drag force low frequency surge motion morison s equation drag coefficient 1 introduction the north sea region is rich in oil resources but its sea conditions are quite challenging wave heights higher than 30 m can occur in the north sea region faltinsen 1993 several mooring line failure incidents in worse weather have been reported on north sea movable offshore drilling units and fpso s during recent years kvitrud 2014 experimental and theoretical studies show that viscous effects on drift force are particular significant for column stabilized platforms in high waves yang et al 2017 however the presently mostly used hydrodynamic analysis software based on three dimensional potential flow theory neglects the viscosity in their theoretical formulation thus the calculated potential drift force fails to consider the influence of viscosity which could lead to the underestimation of the drift forces and the drift motion under storm sea states and the mooring line breaking may occur dev and pinkster 1994 studied the viscous contribution of the mean drift forces on vertical cylinders pointing out that the splash zone of the vertical columns is the major source of the viscous contributions in waves even without currents the splash zone means the part of platform column that interfaces with the wave elevation during the crest and trough phases berthelsen et al 2009 studied the surge motion of a semi submersible in high sea states and compare the numerical results with model test results pointing out that drift forces in moderate and short waves are predicted reasonably well by diffraction analysis in longer waves such as in typical storm sea states viscous drift forces and viscous damping forces increase and can become dominant stansberg et al 2015 considered the viscous effect and wave current interaction effect on the mean wave drift force and proposed a semi empirical formula to correct the potential flow mean wave drift force of semi submersible platform under storm sea conditions this formula can improve the mooring line tension prediction results and was generalized by yang et al 2017 to non collinear wave current conditions yang et al 2017 2018 used two methods to simulate the viscous drift force and viscous damping force of semi submersible platforms under storm sea conditions in the first method the viscous drift force and viscous damping force are simulated using the drag term in morison s equation and the relative velocity in drag term uses the total relative velocity which means the relative velocity between wave current and structure the drag force is integrated up to the instantaneous free surface in the second method the viscous damping force is simulated by drag term in morison s equation using the relative velocity between the structure and current while the viscous drift force is simulated by correcting the potential flow mean wave drift force coefficient using the generalized semi empirical formula in the case of high sea conditions and the presence of currents both models can achieve ideal numerical results compared with model test fonseca and stansberg 2018 calibrated a time domain numerical hydrodynamic model to predict the motion of a semi submersible in high sea states with current in order to achieve numerical time series predictions in good agreement with the model test results they adjusted the hydrodynamic coefficients used for time domain calculation finally they found that the un calibrated numerical model can predict wave frequency motions very well even in high sea states but for lf motions they found that lf wave drift forces quadratic damping coefficients and added mass need increase in high sea states in particular with current also fonseca et al 2018 studied wave drift force coefficients of four different semi submersibles in severe sea states with collinear current the wave drift force coefficients were identified from model tests using a second order signal analysis technique based on cross bi spectral analysis the study shows that good agreement between potential flow drift force coefficients and identified drift force coefficients in small sea states for all four semis but the results show large underestimation of the potential flow drift force coefficients at the low frequency range at a severe sea state especially for the semis with small columns diameter meanwhile they found that currents effects tend to increase the wave drift forces at the low frequency range in this paper the method used by yang et al 2017 is adopted to model the viscous drift force and viscous damping force based on this method this paper further investigates the effect of morison s elements above still water level swl or below swl drag coefficient cd selection and sea states on mean offset extreme offset and standard deviation of low frequency lf surge motion which are not presented and discussed in the paper of yang et al 2017 2018 the study provides a better understanding of hydrodynamic forces and drift motions characteristics of semi submersible in storm sea states in section 2 motion equations modelling method of viscous wave loads using morison s equation is introduced the model test and numerical model are described in section 3 section 4 analyzed and discussed the numerical results in detail and the conclusions are drawn finally 2 the motion equations and hydrodynamic modelling for the semi submersible platform 2 1 the motion equations of semi submersible in waves the motion equations of the floating structure in waves is expressed as follows 1 m a x t 0 t r t τ x τ d τ k x t b w x τ f w 1 t f w 2 t f m f d where m is the structural mass matrix a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency for the platform r t τ is the radiation fluid loads retardation function matrix k is the hydrostatic restoring force coefficient matrix b w is the wave drift damping coefficient f w 1 is the first order wave excitation force f w 2 is the second order low frequency wave excitation force f m is the restoring force from mooring system f d is the fluid viscosity induced hydrodynamic loads on the platform which cannot be ignored for the semi submersible platform in severe sea conditions in this paper the motion equations for the semi submersible is solved using aqwa drift module in time domain the radiation fluid force due to platform motions is expressed using the convolution integral of the fluid loads retardation function and the platform motion velocity where the retardation function is obtained using the fourier transformation of wave damping coefficients the added mass wave damping coefficients first order wave forces and second order mean drift forces are calculated using three dimensional potential flow panel method faltinsen 1993 in aqwa line module the wave drift damping coefficients is obtained using the aranha s formula aranha 1996 in aqwa drift the second order low frequency wave excitation force is calculated using the newman s approximation newman 1974 for the mooring forces presently the linear elastic rope is used to simulate the mooring system and the quasi static method is used for calculation in aqwa drift for the viscous fluid loads on the platform they are modeled by the drag term in morison s equation morison et al 1950 because currently the viscous effect from the columns and pontoons of the platform is focused in the following section the form of the morison s equations is introduced firstly 2 2 the drag forces modelling using morison s equation the semi submersible platform is mostly composed of cylindrical members and when the incoming wave length is long they can be treated as slender members journée and massie 2001 the wave force acting on the slender member can be calculated using morison s equation 2 where the first term represents the drag force and last two terms represent the inertial force 2 d f 1 2 ρ d c d u f u s u f u s ρ a 1 c a u f ρ a c a u s where c d is the drag coefficient c a is the added mass coefficient d is the characteristic drag diameter u f represents the current strength and usually has two forms total velocity including waves and currents and current only while current dominating the fluid particle velocity u s is the structure velocity normal to the slender members and a is the cross sectional area for a member with a rectangular cross section the right handed local coordinate system is established as shown in fig 1 and morison s equation can be expressed by eqs 3 and 4 3 d f y 1 2 ρ d y c d y u f u s u f y u s y ρ a 1 c a y u f y ρ a c a u s y 4 d f z 1 2 ρ d z c d z u f u s u f z u s z ρ a 1 c a z u f z ρ a c a u s z the subscripts of variables in eqs 3 and 4 represent their values in y axis direction and z axis direction respectively for example in fig 1 the width b and height h of the rectangular section can be selected as d y and d z separately it is noted that in eqs 2 4 the drag forces are represented due to the relative velocity between the fluid particles and the structure in this paper the hybrid model of potential panel model and morison s model is used to predict the wave loads on semi submersible platform the inertial force is calculated by the panel model and thus only the drag force term in eqs 2 4 are used to simulate the viscous loads which includes both the fluid loads induced wave excitation force and damping force 2 3 the viscous mean drift force on a fixed column in regular waves without current the drag force term in morison s equation is used to simulate the viscous drift force and viscous damping force which cannot be computed through the potential theory it was studied by faltinsen 1993 that the viscous effect induced mean drift forces is of third order which means it is proportional to the cubic of the wave amplitude in regular waves for a semi submersible platform due to the nonlinear drag forces induced by the relative motions between the incident wave and platforms the viscous drag forces can be generated both on the underwater pontoons and the columns at the water splashing regions in the following how the viscous mean drift forces originate from viscous drag effect is illustrated on fixed column in regular waves according to the linear airy wave theory the incident wave potential at infinite water depth can be written as 5 φ ζ a g ω e k z cos ω t k x the velocity expression of the fluid particle in horizontal direction is 6 u φ x ω ζ a e k z sin ω t k x where ζ a is regular wave amplitude ω is circular wave frequency and k is wave number for the velocity of wave particle in the splash zone the linear wave theory is not accurate because its boundary condition satisfies at z 0 if we assume that the velocity of fluid particle equal to the velocity of fluid particle at z 0 then the fluid particle velocity profile at the axis of column can be expressed as shown in fig 2 the drag force on fixed column in regular waves can be calculated by the following equation 7 f d h ζ x d f d ρ 2 c d d ω 2 ζ a 2 sin ω t k x sin ω t k x h 0 e 2 k z d z 0 ζ x d z the average of sin ω t k x sin ω t k x h 0 e 2 k z d z in eq 7 is zero in one wave period thus the viscous mean drift force is mainly from the splash zone the viscous mean drift force can be expressed as 8 f d ρ 2 c d d ω 2 ζ a 3 1 t 0 t sin 2 ω t k x sin ω t k x d t ρ 4 π c d d ω 2 ζ a 3 1 3 cos 3 k x 3 cos k x it can be seen in eq 8 that the viscous mean drift force in the wave splash zone is proportional to the cube of wave amplitude and the potential mean drift force is proportional to the square of wave amplitude therefore with wave amplitude increasing the viscous mean drift force will become more and more important from eq 8 it seems that the viscous drift forces follow the direction of wave propagation while it is not necessary the direction of the viscous drift forces on the freely floating semi submersible platform in such cases it should be noted that the viscous mean drift forces on the platform could be in line with or on the opposite to the wave propagation direction which depends on phase angle between the platform motions and the wave motions faltinsen 1993 3 model test introduction and numerical model for exwave semi submersible in order to improve the current numerical methods procedures and standard industry practice in prediction of extreme mooring line loads the exwave jip joint industry project was initiated and harbin engineering university participated it based on the semi submersible s model and model test data in this project the analysis of the drift motion of the platform under severe sea conditions is carried out 3 1 primary particulars of exwave semi submersible the exwave semi submersible platform in the exwave jip project is used in this paper the platform consists of two pontoons four square shaped columns with rounded corners four diagonal braces and two cross braces the platform model is shown in fig 3 the platform model has a scale ratio of 1 50 and an operation water depth of 3 m 150 m in full scale primary particulars of full scale exwave semi submersible are shown in table 1 3 2 exwave semi submersible panel model and morison s model the hydrodynamic analysis of the platform is performed using three dimension potential flow theory with constant panel method the right handed global earth fixed coordinate system o xyz is defined in fig 4 the coordinate origin is located at the symmetric center on the swl the x axis is pointing to the bow and the z axis is pointing upwards three sets of exwave semi submersible platform panel model was established in aqwa as shown in fig 4 the number of mesh grid are 1702 3502 and 5000 separately since we focus on the lf surge motion the results of added mass coefficient μ 11 radiation wave damping coefficient λ 11 first order wave force amplitude f x 1 and mean wave drift coefficient f x 2 with different number of panels are shown in fig 5 it is found that the numerical results have good convergence among three panel models thus the frequency domain results of panel model with 1702 panels were used for the remaining hydrodynamic analysis of the semi submersible in irregular waves in order to represents the viscous loads on the platform in severe sea state the morison s drag model is used in aqwa the morison s model is established by the stub method the stub method permits elements of non circular cross section to be modeled eq 3 and eq 4 presents the calculation formula of stub morison s elements as shown in figs 6 8 three different morison s model has been used in order to study the effect of viscous loads on the lf surge motion of the platform morison s model 1 in fig 6 only establishes morison s elements below swl which means that only the drag force from the structural members below the swl at rest is considered morison s model 2 in fig 7 establishes morison s elements all through the vertical columns and the remaining structural members which means that the drag force is considered including all the possible structural members below the instantaneous incident wave surface morison s model 3 in fig 8 only establishes morison s elements above swl this model is obviously unreasonable and it is mainly used for numerical investigation of the effect of the contribution of different viscous loads components compared those from morison s models 1 and 2 it should be noted that in order to avoid duplicate calculations of the inertial forces from the panel method and the empirical morison s model only the drag force term in the morison s formula is retained the direction of arrow in figs 6 8 represents the local coordinate system x axis direction of the morison s element the local y axis direction is given in table 2 proposed by nestgard et al 2017 and the local z axis direction can be determined according to the right handed rule when eqs 2 4 are used to model the drag forces of the platform the drag coefficient cd needs to be determined first it is known that cd for oscillatory flows is dependent on the kc number for the actual platform motions in irregular waves it is expected that the kc number will change from wave to wave and from lf cycle to lf cycle therefore the cd value will be changed on different location of the semi submersible and depend on the sea state and motion as well the focus of this paper is to investigate the effect of the viscous loads from morison s elements strictly speaking the best way to determine the appropriate drag coefficients is via physical model test which depends on not only the section geometry but also the kc number while because the geometrical sections like the column and pontoon have various types of geometry there is still no enough model test data available therefore the drag coefficient cd is determined based on the cross section shape of each morison s element as shown in fig 9 according to the recommended value in dnv rp c205 in fig 10 the selected drag coefficients are shown in table 2 by referring to the work of nestgard et al 2017 the meaning of cdy dy cdz and dz has been explained in eqs 3 4 except as listed in table 2 e1 element also has a drag coefficient c dx 1 0 in the local x direction to simulate the longitudinal drag force from the end of the pontoon and the characteristic length d x is taken as the pontoon width for morison s elements e2 and e3 in fig 9 because the section shape of these elements is neither rectangle with four rounded corners nor rectangle the flow separation of this section shape is severer than that of the rectangle with rounded corner shape type but smaller than that of the rectangle shape type for example if the section shape of e2 is rectangle l d 0 68 r d 0 then the cdz should be about 2 4 if the section shape of e2 is rectangle with rounder corner l d 0 68 r d 0 21 then the cdz should be 1 5 here nestgard et al 2017 directly choose the drag coefficient for rectangle shaped section the situation is the same for cdz of e2 morison s element for e3 element it has the same section shape with e2 however e3 locates at the junction of pontoon and column and the diffraction phenomenon is not obvious thus it was recommended by nestgard et al 2017 to apply a reduction factor of 0 5 at junctions between columns and pontoons cdz 0 5 2 4 1 2 cdy 0 5 1 9 0 95 for morison s elements e5 e6 and e9 the cd coefficient can be chosen according to the dnv rp c205 using linear interpolation method from the available data table for example for e6 and e9 elements l d 1 0 r d 0 25 then the cdy cdz 1 1 for braces e7 and e8 drag coefficients for circular cross sections can be applied the hybrid models used in this paper are the combination of the panel model and the morison s model the hybrid model 1 is the combination of the panel model and the morison s model 1 the hybrid model 2 is the combination of the panel model and the morison s model 2 the hybrid model 3 is the combination of the panel model and the morison s model 3 the main difference between panel model hybrid model 1 hybrid model 2 and hybrid model 3 is the modelling method of viscous effect as shown in table 3 3 3 mooring system in the model test the mooring system consists of four mooring lines and the angle between the mooring lines is 90 which is symmetrically distributed during the model test one end of the mooring line was hung on the basin wall above the water surface and the other end was suspended on the model so that most mooring lines were above the water surface the purpose of this is to remove the effects of the hydrodynamic loads from mooring system on the platform the pull out test has been conducted in aqwa in order to check the restoring force in surge direction as shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the simulation result is close to the model test result and the restoring force of the mooring system is almost linear the restoring force stiffness in surge direction is about 157 kn m the surge natural period of the semi submersible platform obtained in aqwa is 119 3s and the model test value is 116 8s 3 4 model test conditions the sea states studied in this paper all use the torsethaugen wave spectrum which is a two parameter wave spectrum and is suitable for the simulation of the north sea state in norway the significant wave height hs and peak period tp of each sea state are shown in table 4 all the model test conditions used here are given in head seas 4 analysis of semi submersible lf surge motion in the aqwa drift the incident wave time series measured in the model test is used as an input the calculation time step is 0 7 s and the number of calculation steps is 18 000 steps in order to reduce the influence of the transient response at the initial time moment and assure the statistical value more accurate and reliable the numerical results for the low frequency lf surge motion between 1000s and 11800s is used for the statistical value analysis firstly the statistical value time series and power spectral density psd comparison for lf surge motion of the numerical results from hybrid model 2 using c d in table 2 and the model test are given in table 5 figs 12 14 the negative sign in table 5 represents the direction which is on the contrary of the positive direction of x axis and the extreme offset refers to the maximum deviation of the platform from the initial position along the wave propagation direction for convenience the mean offset and the extreme offset in fig 12 are taken as the absolute values it can be seen from table 5 that numerical results of lf surge motion mean offset extreme offset and standard deviation generally compare well with model test results except that the mean offset is overestimated by 30 3 in test no 4060 the extreme offset is overestimated by 18 86 in test no 4040 for psd results it is found that the peak value of tests no 4020 4050 and 4060 compare well with that of model tests while the peak value of tests no 4030 and 4040 is smaller than that of model tests meanwhile both the numerical and model test shows that the peak frequency of test 4060 psd moves to the lower frequency compared with that from the other test no it means that the natural surge frequency changes to lower frequency at severe sea state the phenomena is found by fonseca and stansberg 2018 at present the morison s drag force is used to represent the viscous wave loads where the viscous damping level is varied among different sea state therefore it can be deduced that the change of the natural surge frequency is due to the viscous damping effect which can influence the natural frequency of the dynamic surge motion in the following to further improve the numerical models the effects of different hybrid models and the drag coefficient cd settings on the mean drift motions extreme offset and standard deviation of the drift surge motion are discussed in sections 4 1 4 3 4 1 analysis of the influences of different hybrid models and viscous drag coefficients on mean drift surge motion the lf surge motion of the platform is calculated in the time domain and mean offset obtained by the potential flow panel model hybrid model 1 and hybrid model 2 are compared which are shown in tables 6 and 7 figs 15 and 16 the drag coefficient c d in surge direction is reduced to certain value in order to study the influence of c d on lf surge motion c d dnv in table 6 indicates that the drag coefficients are selected from table 2 according to the dnv rp c205 c d 0 2 means that the drag coefficient of each morison s element in surge direction is reduced by 0 2 based on the coefficients in table 2 presently the drag coefficient in surge direction includes 1 the drag coefficients in local y direction of the e5 e6 e7 e8 and e9 morison s elements 2 the drag coefficient in local x direction of the e1 morison s element in figs 15 and 16 it is observed that the mean offset result decrease with the reduction of surge drag coefficient c d the variation of the mean offset has a linear relationship with the variation of c d which can be analyzed from tables 6 and 7 under each sea state the mean offset result calculated by potential flow theory is lower than the model test result and can be improved evidently by considering the viscous drift contribution from morison s elements the external forces that cause the mean offset of the platform primarily include the potential wave drift force and the viscous mean drift force from morison s drag elements the viscous mean drift force mainly consists of two aspects 1 the average of the viscous drift force from the pontoons is not zero in one wave period 2 the average of viscous drift force of morison s elements around the free surface splash zone is not zero in one wave period neither the reason why the average value from the splash zone is not zero is that the portion of the column near the free surface is sometimes out of water and sometimes in the water causing the average viscous drag force to be non zero in one wave period besides the mean viscous drift force is proportional to the drag coefficient c d eq 8 therefore the mean viscous drift force decreases with the reduction of c d from tables 6 and 7 figs 15 and 16 it can be found that the platform shows larger negative mean offset considering the viscous drift forces than the value obtained based on the potential flow model it means that in the present cases the viscous mean drift forces have the consistent contribution with the mean drift forces from potential flow theory it is also observed that with the same drag coefficient c d the variation of mean offset calculated by hybrid model 2 is much larger than that calculated by hybrid model it is suggested that the upper portion of the cylinder above swl has a quite significant contribution on the total viscous mean drift forces especially for the severer sea states test no 4040 and 4060 it is found from figs 15 and 16 that mean offset surge motion are dependent on the values of cd especially at higher sea states according to the research by dev and pinkster 2001 it is concluded that the morison s elements at the wave splashing region is the main source of viscous drift force compared with the contribution from the pontoons which contribute to the mean surge offset based on figs 6 and 7 it is seen that the calm water line is on the upper end of the morison s element e6 therefore the morison s element e6 and e9 contributes a lot to the mean drift force it means that the drag coefficient for e6 and e9 is very important for properly estimating the viscous drift forces it is seen from fig 16 that the best cd coefficient to get the best agreement with the model test from different test no is different generally the drag coefficient value taken about 0 9 for e6 and e9 morison s element are the best choice for all the test no except test no 4060 where the drag coefficient taken about 0 5 achieves the best agreement for the numerical mean offset compared with the model test in order to investigate the influences of the upper portion of the cylinder above swl on the total viscous mean drift forces and the mean drift surge motions the numerical results of the mean drift surge motion using the hybrid model 3 is provided in table 8 and fig 17 it is seen that the mean drift surge motion using the cd dnv drag coefficient from hybrid model 3 reduced compared with the results from hybrid model 2 because the viscous drift forces from the structural members below the swl is not considered while these numerical results remain the same level of value with the results from hybrid model 1 it shows that the structural members above the swl has important contribution to the total viscous drift forces 4 2 analysis of the influences of different hybrid models and viscous drag coefficients on extreme drift surge motion tables 9 and 10 provide extreme offset results calculated by hybrid model 1 and hybrid model 2 respectively figs 18 and 19 show the bar chart of these results it is observed that potential flow results largely overestimate the extreme values except test no 4060 the reason is that in the potential flow results the viscous loads including the viscous damping on the columns and pontoons are neglected which is actually the main source of the fluid damping on decreasing the resonant surge motion when lf surge motion is simulated using only the potential flow fluid loads the fluid damping has been significantly underestimated therefore the potential flow results largely overestimate the extreme values in hybrid model 1 results the extreme offset increases with the reduction of c d under all sea states however in hybrid model 2 results with the reduction of c d model test case 4020 results increase model test cases 4030 and 4050 results change a little model test cases 4040 and 4060 results decrease firstly the calculation results corresponding to model test no 4060 are focused fig 18 clearly shows that the extreme offset using hybrid model 1 changes quite small with the reduction of drag coefficient c d around at 18 60 m which is 3 7 m smaller than the model test result extreme result calculated by potential flow theory is smaller than the model test result too however in the calculation result of hybrid model 2 the extreme offset prediction result has been significantly improved this also can be shown by the comparison of psd results of test no 4060 c d dnv between hybrid model 1 and hybrid model 2 as shown in fig 20 the peak value of psd using hybrid model 2 is closer to that of the model test fig 19 shows that the extreme offset decrease with the reduction of drag coefficient c d and is close to the model test result this indicates that morison s elements above swl have an important contribution to the prediction of extreme offset in model test no 4060 which represents the storm sea state in fig 19 for the calculation results of hybrid model 2 with the reduction of c d the extreme offset of model test cases 4040 and 4060 decreases while the extreme offset of model test cases 4020 4030 and 4050 increases the reason may be that the incident wave heights of model test cases 4020 4030 and 4050 are relatively small thus the viscous drag force on morison s elements above swl have relatively small contribution to the platform drift motion as a result the extreme offset result using hybrid model 2 should have the same trend with that using hybrid model 1 on the other hand the incident wave height of model test 4040 and model test 4060 is higher so the viscous drag force of morison s elements above swl play an important role and indispensable to the wave excitation force of drift motion as a consequence the extreme offset decreases with the reduction of c d in model test no 4040 4060 instead of increasing with the reduction of c d from the above analysis it seems that the morison s elements located above and below swl have the opposite contribution to the prediction of extreme offset that means the extreme offset will increase with the reduction of c d of morison s elements below swl and decrease with the reduction of c d of morison s elements above swl in model test no 4040 and 4060 with the reduction of c d the reduction of the extreme offset caused by the reduction of c d of morison s elements above swl is larger than the increase caused by the reduction of c d of morison s elements below swl finally the extreme offset will decrease with the reduction of c d to further investigate the influences of the morison s elements modelling the hybrid model 3 in the previous section is still used and the calculated results are compared with the potential flow panel model to study the contribution of morison s elements around the swl to the extreme offset the results are shown in table 11 and fig 21 it can be seen in fig 21 that for model test 4020 4030 and 4050 the extreme results calculated by hybrid model 3 is close to the results calculated by potential panel model the maximum relative differences are about 5 2 model test no 4050 dnv drag coefficients besides the extreme result changes small with the reduction of c d in model test cases 4020 and 4030 this indicates that viscous drag force on morison s elements above swl has quite small contribution to the prediction of drift motion extreme offset under moderate or small sea states whereas for model test no 4040 and 4060 the extreme offset decreases with the reduction of c d the difference between hybrid model 3 and panel model extreme offset results is evident especially model test no 4060 this reveals that morison s elements above swl has relatively larger influence on the extreme drift offset motion under storm sea states fig 18 clearly show that extreme offset results of hybrid model 1 are generally lower than model test results especially for model test 4030 4050 and 4060 while extreme results calculated by hybrid model 2 except for the model test 4040 compare well with model test results therefore it is reasonable to choose hybrid model 2 as the computational model for extreme surge drift motion prediction by comparing extreme offset results calculated by potential flow panel model and hybrid model 1 2 and 3 how viscous drag force from morison s elements above and below swl influence the surge drift motion can be discussed from eq 2 it is shown that the viscous drag force includes viscous drift force and viscous damping force the viscous drift force is more related to the horizontal wave velocity and the viscous damping force is more related to the velocity of the structural elements since the horizontal wave velocity reaches the largest at the free surface viscous drag force on morison s elements above swl have more contribution to the viscous drift force of the platform which can increase the mean offset and extreme offset prediction of the platform besides larger c d will give larger viscous drift force which causes the larger mean offset and extreme offset prediction while morison s elements below swl have smaller contribution to the viscous drift force as the wave velocity decrease exponentially with the depth increases morison s elements below swl have more contribution to the slowly varying surge damping because the wetted surface of morison s elements below swl is much larger than morison s elements above swl including the morison s elements below swl provide the necessary viscous drift damping of the platform and help to reduce the extreme offset of the platform s surge drift motion the larger the drag coefficient c d is the greater the reduction of the extreme offset of the drift motion presently the drag coefficients are determined from the sectional shape only it is seen that the morison s elements around the splash zone contribute largely to the viscous exciting force it is observed from fig 19 that the determined drag coefficients according to the dnv rp c205 achieve the good results of the extreme offset in general in severe sea conditions as test no 4040 and 4060 it is possible to use smaller drag coefficient at the wave splash zone than that determined by the rp rule to get better numerical results 4 3 analysis of the influences of different hybrid models and viscous drag coefficients on standard deviation of surge drift motion the standard deviation reflects the degree of deviation of platform s drift motion from the mean offset tables 12 and 13 show calculation results of the standard deviation using hybrid model 1 and hybrid model 2 figs 22 and 23 present the bar chart of these results in model test case no 4060 using hybrid model 2 the standard deviation decreases with the reduction of the drag coefficient c d while for the other cases listed in tables 12 and 13 the standard deviation increases with the reduction of the drag coefficient c d the standard deviations calculated through potential flow theory are much larger than the model test results or hybrid model 1 and 2 results as the potential flow theory ignores the viscous damping force which provides nearly almost the damping to restrain the platform lf resonant surge motion at present the calculations in model test no 4060 using hybrid model 1 with different c d are generally smaller than the experimental value while results calculated using hybrid model 2 are generally larger than the experimental value in general the results using hybrid model 2 demonstrates better agreement with the model test results in order to investigate the influence of morison s elements above or below swl on the standard deviation of drift motion hybrid model 3 is used and the calculations are shown in fig 24 and table 14 from the results we can see that for model test no 4020 4030 and 4050 the standard deviation increases with the reduction of c d while in model test 4040 and 4060 the standard deviation decreases with the reduction of c d compared with results of hybrid model 2 including morison s elements above and below swl hybrid model 3 only including morison s elements above swl results are generally much larger besides hybrid model 3 results are much larger than model test results this indicates that morison s elements below swl are the major source of viscous drift motion damping it can also be concluded from fig 23 that the determined drag coefficients according to the dnv rp c205 could get the good results for the standard deviation 5 conclusion in this paper the lf surge motion of the semi submersible platform in irregular head wave was studied and numerical simulation results were compared with model test results to find out the motion characteristics in storm sea states the differences between results from the potential panel model and three hybrid models combined potential panel and morison s models under relatively small model test cases 4020 4030 moderate model test case 4050 and storm sea conditions model test cases 4040 4060 were discussed the main conclusions are as follows 1 for mean drift surge motions the mean offset can be improved evidently by considering the viscous drag induced drift forces contribution from morison s elements the mean drift motion is proportional to the drag coefficient c d and decreases with the reduction of c d under storm sea conditions the contribution of viscous effect on the mean drift force is very important 2 for extreme offset results both morison s elements above swl and below swl have contribution morison s elements below swl have more contribution to the viscous damping force the extreme offset increases with the reduction of c d of morison s elements below swl in hybrid model 1 see fig 18 however morison s elements above swl have more contribution to the viscous drift force the extreme offset will decrease with the reduction of c d of morison s elements above swl in hybrid model 3 see fig 21 under storm sea conditions morison s elements above swl is important for the prediction of extreme offset if morison s elements above swl are ignored the adjustment of c d will have little effect on the extreme offset results see fig 18 and the extreme offsets will be smaller than the model test results in this paper the extreme offset results that agree well to the model test result under storm sea conditions can be predicted by using hybrid model 2 3 for standard deviation results the viscous drift force on morison s elements above swl also has an important contribution if this contribution is ignored the standard deviations under different c d are generally smaller than the model test results 4 at present research c d is assumed to be independent of the sea state from the numerical statistical results of lf surge motion it is found that using drag coefficients recommended by dnv rp c205 generally provides good results of the statistical value compared with model test data it should be mentioned that the form of the morison s formula may affect this conclusion presently it is obtained using morison s drag model in terms of the total relative velocity under irregular wave conditions it can also be found that the adjustment of the drag coefficient can achieve better results especially under storm sea state for the present test nos 4040 and 4060 the smaller drag coefficient of the columns compared with that from dnv rp c205 provide better results for the mean offset and extreme offset where the mean offset is more sensitive to the input value of the drag coefficient at wave splashing region credit authorship contribution statement shan ma conceptualization methodology

21626,perspectives on design of offshore wind turbine owt monopile foundations are provided in this paper by logically adopting optimal analysis choices with a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency a newly developed analysis framework is used for this purpose the analysis framework consists of dynamic analysis with linear viscoelastic soil and static analysis with nonlinear elastic soil the framework is used to show that the timoshenko beam theory produces most accurate monopile response although the euler bernoulli beam theory produces optimal results maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency the rigid beam theory can be used only under very restricted soil and monopile conditions the analysis further demonstrates that static analysis is sufficient and optimal in producing monopile soil stiffness values that can be used for determining the natural frequency of vibration of the owts moreover nonlinear elastic analysis is sufficiently accurate and quick to produce monopile responses that can be used in design and there is no need for elasto plastic analysis the aspect of cyclic degradation of soil stiffness over the design life of monopiles is not considered thus an optimal pathway for monopile design is described using the newly developed analysis framework and demonstrated through a design example keywords offshore wind turbine monopile analysis viscoelastic soil nonlinear elastic soil design 1 introduction offshore wind turbines owts are subjected to a variety of environmental loads such as the dynamic lateral loads with a predominant frequency of 0 01 hz bhattacharya and adhikari 2011 arising from wind acting on the tower and turbine assembly and wave and water current loads with a frequency typically ranging over 0 1 0 3 hz kallehave et al 2015 acting on the tower and substructure assembly in addition there are dynamic lateral loads arising from the vibrations of the rotor at the hub level termed as 1p and blade shadowing effects termed as the 3p frequency with the frequency typically ranging over 0 14 0 31 hz and 0 42 0 93 hz respectively for a standard 3 mw wind turbine bhattacharya and adhikari 2011 these loads acting on the owt structure are eventually transferred to the foundation at the seabed level therefore it is necessary to adopt a foundation system for the owt structure that can effectively resist these loads currently monopiles are the most common type of foundation adopted for owts about 80 of existing owt foundations are monopiles because of its simplicity in design fabrication and installation processes ho et al 2016 irena 2012 monopiles supporting owts with a rated power output of 2 5 mw are hollow circular steel piles with diameters typically around 5 m esteban et al 2015 and slenderness ratio length radius of 10 12 klinkvort and hededal 2014 driven hydraulically into the seabed in shallow to moderate water depths of approximately 35 m doherty and gavin 2012 monopile foundations are also expected to support larger sized owts with a power output of more than 6 mw in deeper water depths of up to 60 m these owts would require larger sized monopiles of diameter 7 5 10 m kallehave et al 2015 commonly termed as xl monopiles therefore the analysis and design of monopile foundations supporting owts are of interest to geotechnical engineers the role of a geotechnical or foundation engineer in the design of an owt monopile system are i to evaluate the appropriate dimensions of the monopile that can effectively resist the loads acting on the owt structure and ii to estimate the stiffness of the monopile soil system at the seabed level which is required for the calculation of natural frequency of the owt structure according to dnv 2014 recommendations the design dimensions of monopiles supporting an owt should satisfy two criteria 1 ultimate limit state uls criterion according to which sufficient monopile capacity should be ensured under axial and lateral loads such that the applied loads do not cause collapse of the monopile during an extreme loading event and 2 serviceability limit state sls criterion according to which the maximum allowable monopile head rotation is 0 5 at the seabed under extreme loading conditions of which 0 25 is assumed to occur from installation tolerances therefore the usual allowable limit for monopile head rotation is 0 25 further for the calculation of natural frequency of the owt monopile system estimating the initial elastic stiffness of the monopile soil system is sufficient because the natural frequency is concerned with small amplitudes of vibrations arany et al 2017 in the offshore industry laterally loaded piles and monopiles are designed using the nonlinear winkler spring based p y method gl 2005 american petroleum institute api 2011 dnv 2014 such that the designed pile dimensions satisfy the uls and sls criteria in the p y method the soil is modeled as a series of uncoupled nonlinear springs attached to the pile shaft along its entire length and the pile is modeled as an euler bernoulli beam the attached soil springs are characterized by nonlinear force displacement p y relationships commonly termed as p y curves which depend on the soil properties and the depth at which the spring is attached to the pile however three dimensional 3 d continuum based finite element fe analyses abdel rahman and achmus 2005 lesny and wiemann 2005 haiderali and madabhushi 2013 geotechnical centrifuge tests alderlieste 2011 1 g model laboratory tests møller and christiansen 2011 zhu et al 2015 and reduced scale field tests li et al 2017 on monopiles have shown that the recommended p y curves in the aforementioned design codes american petroleum institute api 2011 dnv 2014 are not suitable for monopile design this is because the code specified p y curves were originally developed by back analyzing the results of a few full scale field load tests reese et al 1974 reese and welch 1975 performed on long slender piles 21 m length and 61 cm diameter and their application to large diameter monopiles in field conditions other than those of the test sites leads to erroneous results achmus et al 2009 several researchers have made an effort to modify the existing p y curves by suggesting a diameter dependant correction factor to the modulus of subgrade reaction for application to monopiles weimann et al 2004 sørensen et al 2010 achmus et al 2011 in fact a new framework similar to the p y method has been developed based on three dimensional 3 d continuum based finite element fe analysis of monopiles in conjunction with site specific field tests byrne et al 2015 zdravkovic et al 2015 murphy et al 2018 in the framework additional monopile soil response curves m ψ distributed moment m along monopile shaft versus rotation ψ of the monopile cross section s b w b shear force s b at the monopile base versus monopile base displacement w b and m b ψ b moment m b at the monopile base versus monopile base rotation ψ b over and above the p y curves are developed using the analysis and test results subsequently these curves are implemented in a one dimensional 1 d fe framework in which the monopile is modeled as a timoshenko beam however this improved p y analyses procedure developed for monopiles sørensen et al 2010 byrne et al 2015 are site specific and their application to other sites across the world is questionable researchers have also used other numerical studies based on 3 d continuum based fe or finite difference fd methods to analyze and design monopiles lesny and wiemann 2005 achmus et al 2009 haiderali and madabhushi 2013 yang et al 2017 these studies describe the monopile as rigid e g achmus et al 2009 thus there is clearly a lack of consensus in the literature as to which beam theory timoshenko euler bernoulli or rigid is most suitable for simulating the monopile behavior in the 3 d continuum based analyses of monopiles the soil is often modeled using elasto plastic constitutive models haiderali and madabhushi 2013 zdravkovic et al 2015 which seems like overkill because in the design of laterally loaded monopiles the sls maximum monopile head rotation of 0 5 at the seabed level is the governing criterion and not the uls nonlinear elastic soil constitutive models that describe the reduction of secant shear modulus with strain vardanega and bolton 2013 oztoprak and bolton 2013 may be sufficient to accurately capture the nonlinearity in soil surrounding the monopile for the level of soil strains generated caused by the small monopile head rotation of 0 5 use of nonlinear elastic models in place of elasto plastic models reduces the complexity of analysis and saves on the computation time therefore it is necessary to investigate if the use of nonlinear elastic soil constitutive models produces sufficiently accurate monopile response within a reasonable run time the studies discussed so far are primarily focused on the design of monopiles based on the sls and uls criteria described above however for a complete design of owt monopile system estimation of the monopile soil stiffness is also necessary because this stiffness is used to calculate the natural frequency of the owt monopile system in the past several research studies have been performed to obtain the natural frequency of the owt monopile system zaaijer 2006 adhikari and bhattacharya 2011 arany et al 2015 in which the stiffness of the monopile soil system see fig 1 a was characterized by three springs representing the swaying stiffness k rr coupled swaying rocking stiffness k rψ and rocking stiffness k ψψ see fig 1 b these spring stiffnesses were either obtained from continuum based numerical analyses poulos and davis 1980 randolph 1981 or continuum based analytical studies shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 and described by simple algebraic equations these equations were obtained for statically applied loads at the monopile head because of which the obtained k rr k rψ and k ψψ are static stiffness functions however the monopile is subjected to dynamic loads of frequencies less than 1 hz and there is no systematic investigation available in the literature regarding whether dynamic stiffnesses k r r k r ψ and k ψ ψ which are complex valued functions in which the imaginary parts not included in k rr k rψ and k ψψ represent the material and radiation damping of the system are required to obtain the natural frequency of owt monopile system incorporating the effects of long term change in soil stiffness and deformation fatigue effects because of cyclic dynamic loads of varying number magnitude and type one way and two way is also necessary for owt monopile design cyclic loading on monopiles over the lifetime of owts results in the degradation of soil stiffness adjacent to the monopiles which changes the natural frequency of the owt structure and increases the monopile head rotation some studies have been performed focusing on the response of monopiles under cyclic loads achmus et al 2009 leblanc et al 2010a b cuéllar 2011 abadie et al 2019 however further research is required for proper quantification of the degradation of soil stiffness with the number of load cycles the foregoing discussion raises several important questions pertaining to owt monopile design 1 which beam theory out of timoshenko euler bernoulli and rigid beam theories should be used to appropriately simulate the monopile behavior such that the monopile response and monopile soil system stiffness are obtained with sufficient accuracy 2 is the use of dynamic analysis incorporating the inertia effects of the monopile and soil necessary to obtain the complex monopile soil stiffness functions and 3 is the use of elasto plastic soil constitutive models necessary to obtain the nonlinear response of monopiles for design against the sls criterion these questions are addressed in this paper using an analysis framework for laterally loaded piles and monopiles developed by the authors basu et al 2009 gupta and basu 2016a b 2017a b 2018a b based on which an optimal analysis pathway is ascertained with which design of monopiles can be done maintaining a balance between accuracy and analysis run time a brief description of the analysis framework is given which incorporates the details of the governing differential equations of the monopile and soil displacements a dynamic analysis framework is first developed which is later simplified for static analysis in the dynamic analysis the soil is modeled as a linear viscoelastic continuum and the monopile is modeled as a timoshenko beam subjected to time harmonic loads it is shown that the analysis can be progressively simplified to model the monopile using the euler bernoulli and rigid beam theories the accuracy and reliability of the analysis framework are verified by comparing the dynamic pile head stiffness and response obtained from the present analysis with those obtained from other methods available in the literature the dynamic analysis framework is then used to investigate i the suitability of beam theories timoshenko euler bernoulli or rigid in simulating monopiles and ii whether dynamic or static monopile soil stiffness is required to accurately obtain the natural frequency of owt monopile systems the dynamic analysis framework is then further extended in which the applied dynamic loads on the owt structure are modeled as equivalent static and the soil is characterized by a nonlinear relationship which describes the reduction of secant shear modulus with shear strain the accuracy of this analysis framework is verified and validated by comparing pile responses obtained from the present analysis with those from other numerical studies and full scale field pile load tests available in the literature the framework is used to investigate whether elasto plastic soil constitutive models are required to accurately predict the monopile response for head rotation of 0 5 the sls criterion finally the insights obtained from the analysis framework are used to design a monopile supporting an owt structure in this design the static loads on the owt structure from wind and waves are evaluated for an extreme condition e g a storm event using the dnv 2014 code of practice relevant geotechnical properties of the subsurface are rationally assumed appropriate monopile dimensions that can effectively resist the applied loads embedded in the nonlinear elastic soil are determined and monopile soil stiffnesses are calculated that can be used as inputs to obtain the natural frequency of the owt monopile system however the implications of cyclic fatigue caused by the degradation of soil stiffness over the life cycle of monopiles are not considered in the design presenting a comprehensive and insightful approach integrating analysis and design is the main contribution of this paper 1 1 analysis framework dynamic loading with linear viscoelastic soil the objectives of developing the dynamic analysis framework are to investigate i which type of beam theory is most suitable for simulating monopile behavior and ii whether dynamic analysis with linear viscoelastic soil is required for obtaining monopile soil stiffness that is used

then substituted in equations 3a 3c of k si t si and λ si to obtain their values using the calculated values of k si t si and λ si monopile displacements and slopes are calculated from equations 9a 9d and 4a 4b the calculated monopile displacements and slopes are then used to calculate γ 1 γ 6 using equations 10a 10b which are then compared with the corresponding assumed initial values if the differences in each of γ 1 γ 6 between the assumed and calculated values are more than the prescribed tolerable limit of 0 001 the calculations described so far are repeated with the calculated values of γ 1 γ 6 as the corresponding new initial guesses iterations are continued until the values of γ 1 γ 6 between successive iterations fall below the prescribed limit at which point the calculated monopile displacements and slopes are accepted as the final values that satisfy the monopile soil equilibrium the differential equations 1a 1b describing monopile displacement can be simplified to obtain monopile response that follow the euler bernoulli beam theory which neglects the effect of shear deformation and rotatory inertia of monopile cross section this is actually achieved by setting g p that results in f i z e p i p w i z in equation 4a which is substituted in equation 5 further setting ρ p i p 0 in the resulting equation 5 simplifies the differential equation to the following 11 e p i p d 4 w i d z 4 2 t s i ρ p i p ω 2 d 2 w i d z 2 k s i ρ p a p λ s i ω 2 w i 0 which is the governing differential equation for monopile displacement following the euler bernoulli beam theory the rigid beam theory requires the monopile to rotate and translate as a rigid cylinder see gupta and basu 2017b which is adequately captured by the algebraic equation 12 w z t w h t ψ h t z where w h t and ψ h t are the monopile head displacement and clockwise rotation at any time t respectively for all the cases with different beam theories the following equation is eventually obtained that relates the steady state monopile head displacement w h and rotation ψ h to the applied force and moment amplitude 13 w h ψ h k r r k r ψ k ψ r k ψ ψ 1 f 0 m 0 where the components k r r k r ψ k ψ r and k ψ ψ on the right hand side of equation 13 are the complex dynamic head stiffnesses of the monopile soil system for the swaying coupled swaying rocking and rocking modes of vibration respectively and are functions of the soil parameters k s t s λ s and the translational and rotational inertias of monopile cross section see gupta and basu 2017b for details these complex dynamic head stiffnesses can be represented as springs and dashpots at the seabed level of the wind turbine structure see figure 1 b and used to evaluate the natural frequency of the owt monopile system the dynamic analysis described so far can be simplified to obtain the response of monopiles embedded in linear elastic soil and subjected to static loads this can be done by neglecting the inertial effects of soil and monopile so that ρ s 0 and ρ p 0 and ignoring hysteretic material damping which becomes irrelevant under static equilibrium so that ξ s 0 thus under static condition the lame s constants describing the elasticity of soil layers are real numbers i e λ s λ s and g s g s the applied loads become static by setting ω 0 such that f a f 0 and m a m 0 the principle of virtual work which is the counterpart of extended hamilton s principle for static equilibriums can be used to obtain the equations for monopile and soil displacements similar to those obtained for dynamic analysis in fact the equations corresponding to the static analysis can be extracted from equations 1 6 by setting ρ s 0 ρ p 0 ξ s 0 and ω 0 note that λ s 0 equation 3c for the static problem at this stage comparisons of monopile responses and monopile soil stiffnesses between those obtained from dynamic and static analyses become pertinent and it is found as described later that static analysis of monopiles modeled as euler bernoulli beams with linear elastic soil is sufficient to obtain accurate monopile soil stiffnesses that can be used to estimate the natural frequency of owt monopile system further it is found as described later that the use of timoshenko beam theory does not significantly improve the accuracy of static linear monopile response over that obtained by using the euler bernoulli beam theory 2 analysis framework static loading with nonlinear elastic soil the analysis framework described in the previous section is extended to incorporate soil nonlinearity the applied dynamic forces from various sources are modeled as equivalent static forces acting at the monopile head the monopile is modeled using the euler bernoulli beam theory because it is shown as described later that the use of euler bernoulli beam theory produces optimal solutions balancing accuracy and run time the soil behavior is characterized by a nonlinear elastic stress strain relationship that describes the reduction of secant shear modulus of soil with generated soil shear strain the objective of developing the nonlinear static analysis is to demonstrate that the use of nonlinear elastic soil constitutive models can produce sufficiently accurate monopile response and therefore these models can be used for designing monopile foundations based on the sls criterion in the nonlinear analysis the soil is characterized by a nonlinear elastic hyperbolic relationship developed by vardanega and bolton 2013 for clays based on the shear stress strain data of undrained fine grained soils reported in the literature a database of 67 tests on 21 clays and plastic silts for use in foundation engineering practice the compiled test data includes fine grained soils from various countries under a variety of conditions from normally consolidated to heavily overconsolidated and performed on a variety of shear testing devices over a period of 30 years the hyperbolic equation relating the secant shear modulus g s of clayey soil to the octahedral engineering shear strain γ oct of the soil is given by 14 g s g s 0 1 γ o c t γ r e f α where g s0 is the initial small strain shear modulus of clayey soil γ ref j pi 1000 with j 2 2 and pi is the plasticity index of soil expressed as a fraction is the octahedral reference shear strain at which the initial shear modulus g s0 is halved and the exponent α 0 736 is the curvature parameter describing the nonlinear variation of shear modulus with γ oct given by 15 γ o c t 2 3 ε r r ε θ θ 2 ε θ θ ε z z 2 ε z z ε r r 2 6 ε r θ 2 ε θ z 2 ε z r 2 in which ε rr ε θθ ε zz ε rθ ε θz and ε zr are the components of the soil strain tensor in r θ z coordinate system the strain induced nonlinearity described in equation 14 makes the soil surrounding the monopile heterogeneous even within each layer because the induced soil strains and the reduced soil shear modulus are different at different points in the soil therefore the differential equations for the nonlinear analysis are different from those of the linear elastic static analysis and are given by 16 e p i p d 4 w d z 4 2 t s z d 2 w d z 2 k s z w 0 17a d 2 φ r d r 2 γ 1 d φ r d r γ 2 φ r

z φ r 2 cos 2 θ φ θ 2 sin 2 θ r d r d θ in equations 18a 18b λ s r θ and g s r θ are spatial functions and remain within the integrals unlike those in the linear elastic analysis as the entire soil mass is assumed to be heterogeneous explicit soil layering is no longer essential in the analysis because the values of the lame s constants are different at different points in the entire soil domain either because of soil layering or because of induced soil strains or both and the initial small strain values of these elastic constants at these points have to be given as part of the input irrespective of the presence of soil layers at the actual site consequently a domain consisting of a single soil layer with heterogeneous properties is assumed the boundary conditions for equation 16 are given by 19a e p i p d 3 w d z 3 z 0 2 t s 0 d w d z z 0 f a 19b e p i p d 2 w d z 2 z 0 m a 19c e p i p d 3 w d z 3 z l p 2 t s l p d w d z z l p 2 k s l p t s l p π 2 r p 2 g s 0 z l p w z l p

17a 17b simultaneously as these are coupled equations with the boundary conditions φ r r p φ θ r p 1 and φ r φ θ 0 the soil domain is discretized in the r direction see fig 2 to perform the fd analysis solutions of differential equations 16 and 17 are obtained using the fd method following an iterative algorithm the monopile is discretized along the z direction with a set of nodes with uniform spacing of δz to solve equation 16 from each monopile node radially outward discretization is made along different radial directions such that the tangential angle δθ is maintained constant between two adjacent radial discretization lines at any depth z the radial discretization is used for solving equations 17a 17b and for numerical integrations of k s and t s non uniform discretization along r with r l 1 r l r l r l 1 where the subscript l represents the node number at a radial distance r l from the monopile edge was found to be more efficient numerically without compromising accuracy the radial discretization directions are maintained the same at different depths so that all the radial discretization lines along any given θ lie in the same vertical plane fig 2 because equations 16 and 17 are one dimensional in nature ordinary differential equations in z or r the numerical algorithm is much faster than that of conventional 3 d analysis in order to obtain the nonlinear load displacement response of piles the load is applied in increments at the beginning of each load increment an initial guess of 1 0 is made for γ 1 γ 8 at each radial node in the soil domain and equations 17a 17b are solved iteratively following the fd method after obtaining φ r and φ θ at different discretized radial distance r l the soil strain components are calculated at each discretized node from which the octahedral shear strain γ oct is calculated at each node using equation 15 subsequently the secant shear modulus g s r θ is evaluated at each node using equation 14 based on the value of γ oct g s r θ φ r and φ θ calculated at the different nodes are then used to obtain k si and t si at each ith node in the z direction following equations 18a 18b by performing numerical integrations along r and θ with the calculated values of k si and t si equation 16 is solved using the fd method to obtain w i and dw i dz at each node along the z axis the calculated values of w i and dw i dz are then used along with the calculated values of g s r θ and λ s r θ to obtain the parameters m s1 m s2 m s3 n s1 and n s2 at different nodes in the radial direction following equations 21a 21e by performing numerical integrations along θ and z after obtaining m s1 m s2 m s3 n s1 and n s2 new values of γ 1 γ 8 are evaluated at each radial node using equations 20a 20h and compared with the corresponding assumed initial values if the differences in the assumed and obtained values of γ 1 γ 8 are more than the prescribed tolerable limit of 0 001 at each node the calculations described so far are repeated with the calculated values of γ 1 γ 8 as the new initial guesses iterations are continued until the values of γ 1 γ 8 between successive iterations fall below the prescribed limit at each node after convergence on γ 1 γ 8 is reached the calculated values of w and dw dz are accepted as the final values for that load increment and the next load increment is applied successive load increments are applied and the iterative process described above is repeated to obtain convergence on γ 1 γ 8 for each load increment until the full applied load is reached 3 results 3 1 accuracy of linear analysis framework to demonstrate the accuracy of the linear dynamic analysis framework a comparison of normalized complex dynamic pile head stiffnesses obtained from the present analysis is made with those of novak and nogami 1977 novak and nogami 1977 analyzed a solid reinforced concrete free head pile with pile base encased in a rigid layer i e the pile base is fixed with zero displacements and rotation the pile soil inputs for the analysis are l p r p 20 e p 28 gpa ν p 0 2 relative pile soil stiffness ratio e p g s 3 103 ν s 0 25 λ s 1 5g s pile soil density ratio ρ p ρ s 1 25 and ξ s 0 025 figures 3a 3c show the complex dimensionless pile head stiffnesses for swaying coupled swaying rocking and rocking motions as functions of the applied dimensionless frequency a 0 ωr p v s where v s g s ρ s is the shear wave velocity of soil the real part of the complex pile head stiffnesses represents the stiffness and the imaginary part represents the damping present in the system because of both material and radiation damping fig 3 a shows the complex stiffness k r r for swaying motion in a normalized form k r r l p 3 e p i p fig 3 b shows the complex stiffness k r ψ for coupled swaying rocking motion in a normalized form k r ψ l p 2 e p i p note that the complex stiffness k r ψ and k ψ r are nearly equal and fig 3 c shows the complex stiffness k ψ ψ for rocking motion in a normalized form k ψ ψ l p e p i p the match between the results obtained from the present analysis with those by novak and nogami 1977 is reasonably well in the present analysis the complex stiffnesses obtained using the timoshenko beam theory is nearly identical to those obtained using the euler bernoulli beam theory for the range of dimensionless frequency investigated which implies that the effect of rotatory inertia and shear deformation included in the timoshenko beam theory is not of much significance fig 4 shows the dynamic pile head stiffness normalized with respect to the corresponding static stiffness for the swaying mode of vibration k r r a 0 k r r a 0 0 k a 0 2 j ξ s r a 0 the imaginary part ξ s r is a summation of the frequency dependent radiation damping ξ r and frequency independent material damping ξ s versus the applied dimensionless frequency a 0 the pile is a fixed head large diameter shaft of solid circular cross section with slenderness ratio l p r p 14 relative pile soil stiffness ratio e p g s 280 and ν p 0 2 embedded in a homogeneous linear viscoelastic soil with ν s 0 4 pile soil density ratio ρ p ρ s 1 25 and ξ s 0 05 and with the pile base resting on top of a rigid layer a good match is obtained between the results obtained from the present dynamic analysis with those of mylonakis 2001 who analyzed the same problem the timoshenko and euler bernoulli beam theories from the present analysis produce nearly identical results for the range of dimensionless frequency investigated a comparison of the results obtained from the present dynamic analysis following the rigid beam theory is performed with the results of a 3 d fe analysis by varun et al 2009 in which the pile is modeled as a massless i e ρ p 0 rigid element with solid circular cross section embedded in a linear viscoelastic three layer soil deposit with ξ si 0 fig 5 a and b show the maximum pile head displacement w h and rotation ψ h respectively as functions of the applied dimensionless frequency a 0 ωr p v s1 where v s1 is the shear wave velocity of the topsoil layer of the pile the details of the pile dimensions and soil properties are shown in the figures the figures show a good agreement between the results of the present analysis and those of the 3 d fe analysis performed by varun et al 2009 next a comparison fig 6 of the results obtained following all the beam theories is made with those of 3 d fe analysis performed using the software package abaqus for the comparison a hollow circular steel monopile with l p 30 m r p 5 m and t p 106 4 mm is considered to be embedded in a three layered linear elastic soil deposit with g s1 6 25 mpa and ν s1 0 2 g s2 9 62 mpa and ν s2 0 3 and g s3 13 46 mpa and ν s3 0 3 for the top middle and bottom layers respectively the thickness of each soil layer is reported in the figure itself the applied force f a 8 mn and moment m a 60 mnm are static in nature it is evident that the timoshenko euler bernoulli and rigid beam theories produce monopile displacements quite close to that of 3 d fe analysis however the monopile rotation is significantly underestimated following the rigid beam theory while the timoshenko beam theory provides the best results because it accounts for the effect of shear deformation within the monopile cross section unlike the euler bernoulli beam theory because the timoshenko beam theory captures the shear deformation within the monopile cross section sudden changes in shear force and shear deformation at the interfaces of adjacent soil layers caused by mismatch between soil young s moduli of adjacent layers are reflected in the sudden changes of timoshenko beam slope rotation because shear deformation and slope are related in the timoshenko beam theory see fig 6 b 3 2 appropriateness of dynamic analysis and beam theories for monopiles although owt structures are subjected to dynamic lateral loads it is possible that the inertia of the monopile soil system and the corresponding damping hysteretic material damping plus radiation damping because of wave propagation in the soil may not have any significant contribution to the monopile response because the applied loading frequencies are less than 1 hz static analysis might be sufficient to obtain the monopile soil stiffness further it is evident from the foregoing results that the timoshenko and euler bernoulli beam theories produce nearly identical monopile soil stiffness moreover monopiles have also been found to undergo rigid body motion therefore investigations on the necessity of dynamic analysis and on the suitability of beam theories in simulating the monopile response and obtaining monopile soil stiffness are performed next four different cases of monopiles currently supporting owts at different sites across europe table 1 are considered the monopile dimensions l p r p and t p are reported in table 1 and e p 210 gpa ν p 0 3 and ρ p 7850 kg m3 are chosen to characterize the steel monopile the soil young s modulus e s at different wind farm sites are obtained from shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 and typical values of other soil properties ν s 0 25 ρ s 1700 kg m3 and ξ s 0 05 are assumed for the purpose of investigation reasonable values of the amplitude of applied loading f 0 and m 0 are assumed and the maximum dimensionless frequency a 0 ωr p v s where v s is the shear wave velocity of the top soil layer and ω 2πf in which f is the applied loading frequency in hz for each of the wind farm sites is adopted from adhikari and bhattacharya 2012 table 1 table 1 shows the maximum monopile head displacement w h and head rotation ψ h obtained from the dynamic and static analyses following the three different beam theories it is evident from table 1 that the dynamic responses obtained using the three beam theories are always greater than the corresponding static responses a maximum difference of 4 7 in w h and 4 8 in ψ h are obtained between the dynamic and corresponding static responses considering all the wind farm sites table 2 shows the comparison of the dynamic and static stiffnesses for all the wind farm sites obtained using all the three beam theories it is evident from the comparison that for forcing frequencies less than 1 hz static stiffness is sufficient to evaluate the natural frequency of the owt structure the computational times required to obtain monopile responses using the dynamic and static analyses with the three different beam theories for all the four wind farm sites are given in table 3 the time required to run a dynamic analysis is approximately three times that of the corresponding static analysis therefore for monopiles supporting owts subjected to loading frequencies less than 1 hz static analysis can be used to quickly obtain monopile soil stiffnesses the rigid beam theory produces the fastest monopile response however the timoshenko and euler bernoulli beam theories produce much better estimates of the monopile response the timoshenko beam theory takes the longest to produce results a comparison of the percent difference in the static responses obtained using the euler bernoulli and rigid beam theories with respect to those obtained using the timoshenko beam theory for the four wind farm sites is shown in table 4 it is evident that the percent difference is the maximum for the rigid theory this is because the rigid theory is strictly applicable to monopiles when the relative monopile soil stiffness ratio e p g s 105 g s g s 1 0 75ν s and the slenderness l p r p is in the range of 5 20 gupta and basu 2018a therefore careful consideration of e p g s and l p r p is required for using the rigid beam theory for monopiles further for all the cases studied the percent difference in responses between the timoshenko and euler bernoulli beam theories is approximately 3 for w h and 9 for ψ h although the timoshenko beam theory gives a better prediction of ψ h which is the design criterion for monopiles the difference is typically less than 10 considering the facts related to accuracy and computational time described in tables 1 4 it can be reasonably concluded that static analysis is sufficient and optimal for obtaining monopile response and monopile soil stiffness further the widely used euler bernoulli beam theory can produce reliable monopile displacement and monopile soil stiffness without any significant loss of accuracy 3 3 accuracy of nonlinear analysis framework the accuracy of the nonlinear static analysis framework is checked by comparing monopile responses obtained using the present framework with those obtained from 3 d nonlinear fe analyses in which the same nonlinear constitutive relationship described by equation 14 is given as input additionally validation of the nonlinear analysis with respect to full scale field pile load tests is done fig 7 a b show the comparison of monopile responses pile head displacement w h and pile head rotation ψ h obtained from the present and 3 d fe analyses for an applied force and moment respectively the soil deposit is assumed to follow equation 14 with γ ref 0 002 the details of the pile soil inputs are given in the figure the initial small strain shear modulus g s0 20 mpa and ν s 0 49 are given as input to the analysis the monopile head responses from the present analysis and 3 d fe analysis match very closely the computational times required are approximately 8600 s and 330 s for the fe analysis and present analysis respectively in a computer with intel core i5 3210m cpu 2 50 ghz and 8 gb ram similar other comparisons were performed with excellent match between the results of 3 d fe analysis and present analysis and similar contrasting run times were observed gupta 2018 thus the present nonlinear analysis framework is as accurate as the 3 d nonlinear fe analysis framework but computationally one order of magnitude more efficient fig 8 shows the load versus pile head displacement w h obtained from the present nonlinear analysis and from the field load test of a stubby reinforced concrete pile at a los angeles test site bhushan et al 1979 the soil at the test site consists of overconsolidated sandy clay of medium to high plasticity with an average undrained shear strength s u 143 7 kpa vallahban and alikhanlou 1982 and plasticity index pi 30 bhushan et al 1979 for the comparison the initial small strain young s modulus e s0 49 8 mpa is evaluated based on the ratio e s0 s u 347 usace 1990 with g

applied at a height h c 0 23 m above the ground surface fig 9 shows the comparison of pile head displacement w h obtained from the present analysis with that of a lateral load test performed on a steel pipe pile at sabine texas test site matlock 1970 the p y analysis result of the same field problem reported by reese et al 1974 and based on the api 2011 recommended p y curves is also presented in the figure matlock 1970 the soil at the site consists of lightly overconsolidated soft clay for which the overconsolidation ratio ocr is assumed to be 1 5 following the recommendation of wu et al 1997 with s u 14 4 kpa and pi 68 guo 2013 such that γ ref 2 2 0 68 1000 0 001496 for the comparison e s0 3 9 mpa is evaluated based on the ratio e s0 s u 270 usace 1990 such that g s0 1 3 mpa for ν s 0 49 it is evident from figs 8 and 9 that the present nonlinear elastic analysis framework is capable of predicting pile responses in the field quite well the p y analysis fig 9 may sometimes fail to correctly predict the pile response because it is based on site specific semi empirical input parameters and does not account for the true 3 d pile soil interaction 3 4 appropriateness of nonlinear elastic analysis elasto plastic fe analysis is sometimes used to determine the nonlinear response of monopiles abdel rahman and achmus 2005 haiderali and madabhushi 2013 while analysis with the use of a proper elasto plastic soil constitutive model may produce accurate monopile response the time required for such analysis is often very high therefore it would be interesting to find out what benefit an elasto plastic analysis may have over the present nonlinear elastic analysis results obtained from the present nonlinear elastic analysis are compared with 3 d elasto plastic analysis for large diameter monopiles the monopile head rotation ψ h design criterion for monopiles supporting owts obtained from the present analysis is compared with the response obtained from 3 d fe analysis performed using abaqus in which the mohr coulomb soil constitutive model is used fig 8 three different monopiles with radius r p 2 0 3 0 and 3 75 m are chosen with e p 210 gpa ν p 0 3 ρ p 7850 kg m3 l p 35 m and t p 6 35 2 r p 100 mm api 2011 and the lateral load is applied at a height h c 36 2 m above the ground surface the monopiles are assumed to be embedded in a heavily overconsolidated stiff undrained clay deposit in which the clay deposit is characterized by s u 100 kpa pi 38 and ocr 2 5 such that g s0 16 1 mpa for ν s 0 49 mpa usace 1990 recommendations and γ ref j pi 1000 2 2 0 38 1000 0 00084 in the 3 d fe analysis the monopile soil interface is modeled using the finite sliding surface to surface master slave contact formulation with a normal hard contact allowing separation and no separation after contact and a tangential contact for which a typical friction coefficient of 0 25 for the clay steel interface lemos and vaughan 2000 is given as input it is evident from fig 10 that the present analysis using nonlinear elastic constitutive relationship is capable of predicting sufficiently accurate monopile response there is not much gain in accuracy achieved by using the mohr coulomb elasto plastic model further the effect of pile soil separation is not of much significance for monopiles with a maximum head rotation of 0 5 sls design criterion the computational times required are approximately 11500 s for the 3 d elasto plastic fe analysis and 500 s for the present nonlinear elastic analysis which further confirms that the present nonlinear analysis provides the optimal solution 3 5 application of developed analysis framework to design of a monopile from a geotechnical engineering design perspective a monopile supporting an owt should satisfy two design criteria i ultimate limit state uls criterion of collapse against the applied lateral and axial loads and ii serviceability limit state sls criterion of maximum allowable head rotation ψ h 0 5 at the seabed under extreme lateral loads dnv 2014 it is reported in the literature that the effect of the axial loads on the lateral response of monopiles supporting owts is negligible haiderali and madabhushi 2013 arany et al 2015 therefore in design the monopile is generally assumed safe against axial loads which arises primarily from the self weight of the wind turbine tower the turbine and the substructure assembly for monopiles the allowable head rotation is often the governing design criterion i e the design is based on sls criterion rather than the uls criterion therefore in this study design of a monopile under extreme loading conditions is performed following the sls criterion of ψ h 0 5 installation tolerances are neglected and the monopile is designed based on the maximum allowable head rotation the steps in the present design are i evaluation of the maximum lateral loads on the owt structure which are transferred to the monopile head at the seabed ii evaluation of the geotechnical inputs of soil of the selected site and iii using the inputs obtained from i and ii in the static nonlinear elastic analysis to select appropriate monopile dimensions that satisfy ψ h 0 5 apart from obtaining the monopile dimensions that satisfy the sls the static elastic stiffnesses k r r k r ψ and k ψ ψ of the monopile soil system are also determined which can be used to evaluate the natural frequency of the owt monopile system a design requirement for the owt the aspect of degradation of soil stiffness caused by long term cyclic loads is kept outside the scope of the design because of the lack of proper quantification of the stiffness degradation in the literature it should be noted that the analysis framework can be naturally extended to incorporate the cyclic stiffness degradation with a proper soil constitutive model representing the field cyclic behavior of the monopile soil system 3 6 evaluation of maximum lateral loads acting on the owt structure the wind turbine structure is subjected to dynamic lateral loads from wind waves water currents and vibrations from the rotor and blades fig 11 the dynamic loads on the wind turbine structure from water currents rotor and blades are very small compared with the wind and wave loads lombardi 2010 arany et al 2015 hence the dynamic loads from water currents rotor and blades are neglected in the present design the dynamic loads on the wind turbine structure arising from wind and wave are modeled as equivalent static horizontal force f a and overturning moment m a at the monopile head 3 7 maximum lateral load from wind according to the dnv 2014 code there are numerous wind load scenarios which should be analyzed to design the owt monopile system in this design the wind force is evaluated when

overconsolidated undrained soft clay deposit equation 14 is used to model the nonlinear soil behavior the soil inputs in the analysis are given in table 8 3 10 monopile dimensions in this design the monopile is modeled following the euler bernoulli beam theory the monopile wall thickness t p american petroleum institute api 2011 and second moment of inertia i p which are inputs in the analysis are evaluated from 26a t p 6 35 2 r p 100 26b i p π 4 r p 4 r p t p 4 for r p 2 5 m t p 56 35 mm and i p 2 67 m4 the monopile embedment length l p which can effectively resist f a and m a is obtained following the gl 2005 recommendations for offshore piles under extreme static loading conditions gl 2005 outlines the following set of criteria for estimating l p i the vertical tangent criterion i e displacement profile of the monopile has vertical tangent at the toe ii zero toe kick criterion i e zero or no negative displacement at the monopile toe or base should be maintained and iii critical pile length criterion the monopile length is such that any further increase in the length has little or no effect on the pile head response achmus et al 2009 and kuo et al 2011 found that the criteria i and ii are very conservative and result in very large embedment lengths hence these criteria are unsuitable for monopile design therefore in the present design l p is evaluated following criterion iii for the selection of the appropriate monopile embedment length several guesses of l p are made such that ψ h 0 5 the monopile response for each guess from the present nonlinear elastic analysis is reported in table 9 it is evident from table 9 that for an applied loading of f a 3 8 mn and m a 120 96 mnm table 7 at the monopile head with r p 2 5 m a design length l p 30 m can be used however following criterion iii of gl 2005 described in the preceding paragraph l p 40 m should be used because an increase in l p beyond 40 m has little or no impact on ψ h finally for the design monopile length l p 40 m and radius r p 2 5 m the elastic static stiffnesses k r r 0 5137 gn m k r ψ 3 8551 gn rad and k ψ ψ 72 5919 gnm rad are evaluated from the analysis these stiffnesses can be used to evaluate the natural frequency of the owt monopile system 4 conclusions a new continuum based analysis framework for offshore wind turbine monopile foundations is presented the framework has two main parts 1 dynamic analysis with linear viscoelastic soil and 2 static analysis with nonlinear elastic soil in the dynamic analysis the soil is modeled as a linear viscoelastic continuum and the monopile is modeled using the timoshenko beam theory the monopile is subjected to harmonic loads at the head it is shown that the analysis can be progressively simplified to model the monopile using the euler bernoulli and rigid beam theories the dynamic analysis framework can be simplified to analyze monopiles embedded in linear elastic soil and subjected to static loads the linear static analysis is further extended to develop a framework for nonlinear static analysis of monopiles in which the soil is modeled as a nonlinear elastic continuum the monopile is modeled using the euler bernoulli beam theory and the dynamic loads on the owt structure are modeled as equivalent static loads at the monopile head the accuracy of the analysis framework is ensured by comparing the results obtained from the present analysis with those obtained from other numerical studies available in the literature 3 d finite element analyses performed as part of the present study and field pile load tests the dynamic analysis framework is used to investigate i which beam theory is most suitable for simulation of monopile response and ii what type of monopile soil stiffness dynamic or static is appropriate for calculating the natural frequency of the owt monopile system it is found that static analysis in which the soil is modeled as a linear elastic continuum and monopile is modeled using the euler bernoulli beam theory is optimal for obtaining sufficiently accurate monopile soil stiffness required for calculation of natural frequency of owt monopile system the nonlinear analysis framework in which the applied loads are static and the soil is nonlinear elastic is used to investigate whether such an analysis is sufficient to design monopiles against the serviceability limit state criterion of ψ h 0 5 or more sophisticated elasto plastic analysis is required it is found that the present analysis produces monopile response accurately and quickly and no significant gain in accuracy is obtained by treating the soil as an elasto plastic continuum thus the developed nonlinear elastic framework can be conveniently used for monopile design finally a step by step design of a monopile is performed using the newly developed analysis framework in the design it is shown i how the dynamic loads on the owt structure from wind and waves can be evaluated as equivalent static loads under extreme conditions based on the recommendations of dnv 2014 and ii how appropriate monopile dimensions can be selected using the developed analysis framework based on the criteria set in gl 2005 and dnv 2014 that can effectively resist the applied loads the aspect of cyclic degradation of soil stiffness over the life cycle of monopiles is not considered in the design overall the paper provides

21626,perspectives on design of offshore wind turbine owt monopile foundations are provided in this paper by logically adopting optimal analysis choices with a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency a newly developed analysis framework is used for this purpose the analysis framework consists of dynamic analysis with linear viscoelastic soil and static analysis with nonlinear elastic soil the framework is used to show that the timoshenko beam theory produces most accurate monopile response although the euler bernoulli beam theory produces optimal results maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency the rigid beam theory can be used only under very restricted soil and monopile conditions the analysis further demonstrates that static analysis is sufficient and optimal in producing monopile soil stiffness values that can be used for determining the natural frequency of vibration of the owts moreover nonlinear elastic analysis is sufficiently accurate and quick to produce monopile responses that can be used in design and there is no need for elasto plastic analysis the aspect of cyclic degradation of soil stiffness over the design life of monopiles is not considered thus an optimal pathway for monopile design is described using the newly developed analysis framework and demonstrated through a design example keywords offshore wind turbine monopile analysis viscoelastic soil nonlinear elastic soil design 1 introduction offshore wind turbines owts are subjected to a variety of environmental loads such as the dynamic lateral loads with a predominant frequency of 0 01 hz bhattacharya and adhikari 2011 arising from wind acting on the tower and turbine assembly and wave and water current loads with a frequency typically ranging over 0 1 0 3 hz kallehave et al 2015 acting on the tower and substructure assembly in addition there are dynamic lateral loads arising from the vibrations of the rotor at the hub level termed as 1p and blade shadowing effects termed as the 3p frequency with the frequency typically ranging over 0 14 0 31 hz and 0 42 0 93 hz respectively for a standard 3 mw wind turbine bhattacharya and adhikari 2011 these loads acting on the owt structure are eventually transferred to the foundation at the seabed level therefore it is necessary to adopt a foundation system for the owt structure that can effectively resist these loads currently monopiles are the most common type of foundation adopted for owts about 80 of existing owt foundations are monopiles because of its simplicity in design fabrication and installation processes ho et al 2016 irena 2012 monopiles supporting owts with a rated power output of 2 5 mw are hollow circular steel piles with diameters typically around 5 m esteban et al 2015 and slenderness ratio length radius of 10 12 klinkvort and hededal 2014 driven hydraulically into the seabed in shallow to moderate water depths of approximately 35 m doherty and gavin 2012 monopile foundations are also expected to support larger sized owts with a power output of more than 6 mw in deeper water depths of up to 60 m these owts would require larger sized monopiles of diameter 7 5 10 m kallehave et al 2015 commonly termed as xl monopiles therefore the analysis and design of monopile foundations supporting owts are of interest to geotechnical engineers the role of a geotechnical or foundation engineer in the design of an owt monopile system are i to evaluate the appropriate dimensions of the monopile that can effectively resist the loads acting on the owt structure and ii to estimate the stiffness of the monopile soil system at the seabed level which is required for the calculation of natural frequency of the owt structure according to dnv 2014 recommendations the design dimensions of monopiles supporting an owt should satisfy two criteria 1 ultimate limit state uls criterion according to which sufficient monopile capacity should be ensured under axial and lateral loads such that the applied loads do not cause collapse of the monopile during an extreme loading event and 2 serviceability limit state sls criterion according to which the maximum allowable monopile head rotation is 0 5 at the seabed under extreme loading conditions of which 0 25 is assumed to occur from installation tolerances therefore the usual allowable limit for monopile head rotation is 0 25 further for the calculation of natural frequency of the owt monopile system estimating the initial elastic stiffness of the monopile soil system is sufficient because the natural frequency is concerned with small amplitudes of vibrations arany et al 2017 in the offshore industry laterally loaded piles and monopiles are designed using the nonlinear winkler spring based p y method gl 2005 american petroleum institute api 2011 dnv 2014 such that the designed pile dimensions satisfy the uls and sls criteria in the p y method the soil is modeled as a series of uncoupled nonlinear springs attached to the pile shaft along its entire length and the pile is modeled as an euler bernoulli beam the attached soil springs are characterized by nonlinear force displacement p y relationships commonly termed as p y curves which depend on the soil properties and the depth at which the spring is attached to the pile however three dimensional 3 d continuum based finite element fe analyses abdel rahman and achmus 2005 lesny and wiemann 2005 haiderali and madabhushi 2013 geotechnical centrifuge tests alderlieste 2011 1 g model laboratory tests møller and christiansen 2011 zhu et al 2015 and reduced scale field tests li et al 2017 on monopiles have shown that the recommended p y curves in the aforementioned design codes american petroleum institute api 2011 dnv 2014 are not suitable for monopile design this is because the code specified p y curves were originally developed by back analyzing the results of a few full scale field load tests reese et al 1974 reese and welch 1975 performed on long slender piles 21 m length and 61 cm diameter and their application to large diameter monopiles in field conditions other than those of the test sites leads to erroneous results achmus et al 2009 several researchers have made an effort to modify the existing p y curves by suggesting a diameter dependant correction factor to the modulus of subgrade reaction for application to monopiles weimann et al 2004 sørensen et al 2010 achmus et al 2011 in fact a new framework similar to the p y method has been developed based on three dimensional 3 d continuum based finite element fe analysis of monopiles in conjunction with site specific field tests byrne et al 2015 zdravkovic et al 2015 murphy et al 2018 in the framework additional monopile soil response curves m ψ distributed moment m along monopile shaft versus rotation ψ of the monopile cross section s b w b shear force s b at the monopile base versus monopile base displacement w b and m b ψ b moment m b at the monopile base versus monopile base rotation ψ b over and above the p y curves are developed using the analysis and test results subsequently these curves are implemented in a one dimensional 1 d fe framework in which the monopile is modeled as a timoshenko beam however this improved p y analyses procedure developed for monopiles sørensen et al 2010 byrne et al 2015 are site specific and their application to other sites across the world is questionable researchers have also used other numerical studies based on 3 d continuum based fe or finite difference fd methods to analyze and design monopiles lesny and wiemann 2005 achmus et al 2009 haiderali and madabhushi 2013 yang et al 2017 these studies describe the monopile as rigid e g achmus et al 2009 thus there is clearly a lack of consensus in the literature as to which beam theory timoshenko euler bernoulli or rigid is most suitable for simulating the monopile behavior in the 3 d continuum based analyses of monopiles the soil is often modeled using elasto plastic constitutive models haiderali and madabhushi 2013 zdravkovic et al 2015 which seems like overkill because in the design of laterally loaded monopiles the sls maximum monopile head rotation of 0 5 at the seabed level is the governing criterion and not the uls nonlinear elastic soil constitutive models that describe the reduction of secant shear modulus with strain vardanega and bolton 2013 oztoprak and bolton 2013 may be sufficient to accurately capture the nonlinearity in soil surrounding the monopile for the level of soil strains generated caused by the small monopile head rotation of 0 5 use of nonlinear elastic models in place of elasto plastic models reduces the complexity of analysis and saves on the computation time therefore it is necessary to investigate if the use of nonlinear elastic soil constitutive models produces sufficiently accurate monopile response within a reasonable run time the studies discussed so far are primarily focused on the design of monopiles based on the sls and uls criteria described above however for a complete design of owt monopile system estimation of the monopile soil stiffness is also necessary because this stiffness is used to calculate the natural frequency of the owt monopile system in the past several research studies have been performed to obtain the natural frequency of the owt monopile system zaaijer 2006 adhikari and bhattacharya 2011 arany et al 2015 in which the stiffness of the monopile soil system see fig 1 a was characterized by three springs representing the swaying stiffness k rr coupled swaying rocking stiffness k rψ and rocking stiffness k ψψ see fig 1 b these spring stiffnesses were either obtained from continuum based numerical analyses poulos and davis 1980 randolph 1981 or continuum based analytical studies shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 and described by simple algebraic equations these equations were obtained for statically applied loads at the monopile head because of which the obtained k rr k rψ and k ψψ are static stiffness functions however the monopile is subjected to dynamic loads of frequencies less than 1 hz and there is no systematic investigation available in the literature regarding whether dynamic stiffnesses k r r k r ψ and k ψ ψ which are complex valued functions in which the imaginary parts not included in k rr k rψ and k ψψ represent the material and radiation damping of the system are required to obtain the natural frequency of owt monopile system incorporating the effects of long term change in soil stiffness and deformation fatigue effects because of cyclic dynamic loads of varying number magnitude and type one way and two way is also necessary for owt monopile design cyclic loading on monopiles over the lifetime of owts results in the degradation of soil stiffness adjacent to the monopiles which changes the natural frequency of the owt structure and increases the monopile head rotation some studies have been performed focusing on the response of monopiles under cyclic loads achmus et al 2009 leblanc et al 2010a b cuéllar 2011 abadie et al 2019 however further research is required for proper quantification of the degradation of soil stiffness with the number of load cycles the foregoing discussion raises several important questions pertaining to owt monopile design 1 which beam theory out of timoshenko euler bernoulli and rigid beam theories should be used to appropriately simulate the monopile behavior such that the monopile response and monopile soil system stiffness are obtained with sufficient accuracy 2 is the use of dynamic analysis incorporating the inertia effects of the monopile and soil necessary to obtain the complex monopile soil stiffness functions and 3 is the use of elasto plastic soil constitutive models necessary to obtain the nonlinear response of monopiles for design against the sls criterion these questions are addressed in this paper using an analysis framework for laterally loaded piles and monopiles developed by the authors basu et al 2009 gupta and basu 2016a b 2017a b 2018a b based on which an optimal analysis pathway is ascertained with which design of monopiles can be done maintaining a balance between accuracy and analysis run time a brief description of the analysis framework is given which incorporates the details of the governing differential equations of the monopile and soil displacements a dynamic analysis framework is first developed which is later simplified for static analysis in the dynamic analysis the soil is modeled as a linear viscoelastic continuum and the monopile is modeled as a timoshenko beam subjected to time harmonic loads it is shown that the analysis can be progressively simplified to model the monopile using the euler bernoulli and rigid beam theories the accuracy and reliability of the analysis framework are verified by comparing the dynamic pile head stiffness and response obtained from the present analysis with those obtained from other methods available in the literature the dynamic analysis framework is then used to investigate i the suitability of beam theories timoshenko euler bernoulli or rigid in simulating monopiles and ii whether dynamic or static monopile soil stiffness is required to accurately obtain the natural frequency of owt monopile systems the dynamic analysis framework is then further extended in which the applied dynamic loads on the owt structure are modeled as equivalent static and the soil is characterized by a nonlinear relationship which describes the reduction of secant shear modulus with shear strain the accuracy of this analysis framework is verified and validated by comparing pile responses obtained from the present analysis with those from other numerical studies and full scale field pile load tests available in the literature the framework is used to investigate whether elasto plastic soil constitutive models are required to accurately predict the monopile response for head rotation of 0 5 the sls criterion finally the insights obtained from the analysis framework are used to design a monopile supporting an owt structure in this design the static loads on the owt structure from wind and waves are evaluated for an extreme condition e g a storm event using the dnv 2014 code of practice relevant geotechnical properties of the subsurface are rationally assumed appropriate monopile dimensions that can effectively resist the applied loads embedded in the nonlinear elastic soil are determined and monopile soil stiffnesses are calculated that can be used as inputs to obtain the natural frequency of the owt monopile system however the implications of cyclic fatigue caused by the degradation of soil stiffness over the life cycle of monopiles are not considered in the design presenting a comprehensive and insightful approach integrating analysis and design is the main contribution of this paper 1 1 analysis framework dynamic loading with linear viscoelastic soil the objectives of developing the dynamic analysis framework are to investigate i which type of beam theory is most suitable for simulating monopile behavior and ii whether dynamic analysis with linear viscoelastic soil is required for obtaining monopile soil stiffness that is used

the monopile axis and points downward the reference radial direction r 0 coincides with the direction of the applied force f a and the tangential angle θ measured from r 0 is clockwise positive when

dimensionless functions φ r and φ θ describe how the radial and tangential displacements in the soil caused by monopile motion decrease with increase in radial distance from the monopile these

monopile displacements and slopes are accepted as the final values that satisfy the monopile soil equilibrium the differential equations 1a 1b describing monopile displacement can be simplified to obtain monopile response that follow the euler bernoulli beam theory which neglects the effect of shear deformation and rotatory inertia of monopile cross section this is actually achieved by setting g p that results in f i z e p i p w i z in equation 4a which is substituted in equation 5 further setting ρ p i p 0 in the resulting equation 5 simplifies the differential equation to the following 11 e p i p d 4 w i d z 4 2 t s i ρ p i p ω 2 d 2 w i d z 2 k s i ρ p a p λ s i ω 2 w i 0 which is the governing differential equation for monopile displacement following the euler bernoulli beam theory the rigid beam theory requires the monopile to rotate and translate as a rigid cylinder see gupta and basu 2017b which is adequately captured by the algebraic equation 12 w z t w h t ψ h t z where w h t and ψ h t are the monopile head displacement and clockwise rotation at any time t respectively for all the cases with different beam theories the following equation is eventually obtained that relates the steady state monopile head displacement w h and rotation ψ h to the applied force and moment amplitude 13 w h ψ h k r r k r ψ k ψ r k ψ ψ 1 f 0 m 0 where the components k r r k r ψ k ψ r and k ψ ψ on the right hand side of equation 13 are the complex dynamic head stiffnesses of the monopile soil system for the swaying coupled swaying rocking and rocking modes of vibration respectively and are functions of the soil parameters k s t s λ s and the translational and rotational inertias of monopile cross section see gupta and basu 2017b for details these complex dynamic head stiffnesses can be represented as springs and dashpots at the seabed level of the wind turbine structure see figure 1 b and used to evaluate the natural frequency of the owt monopile system the dynamic analysis described so far can be simplified to obtain the response of monopiles embedded in linear elastic soil and subjected to static loads this can be done by neglecting the inertial effects of soil and monopile so that ρ s 0 and ρ p 0 and ignoring hysteretic material damping which becomes irrelevant under static equilibrium so that ξ s 0 thus under static condition the lame s constants describing the elasticity of soil layers are real numbers i e λ s λ s and g s g s the applied loads become static by setting ω 0 such that f a f 0 and m a m 0 the principle of virtual work which is the counterpart of extended hamilton s principle for static equilibriums can be used to obtain the equations for monopile and soil displacements similar to those obtained for dynamic analysis in fact the equations corresponding to the static analysis can be extracted from equations 1 6 by setting ρ s 0 ρ p 0 ξ s 0 and ω 0 note that λ s 0 equation 3c for the static problem at this stage comparisons of monopile responses and monopile soil stiffnesses between those obtained from dynamic and static analyses become pertinent and it is found as described later that static analysis of monopiles modeled as euler bernoulli beams with linear elastic soil is sufficient to obtain accurate monopile soil stiffnesses that can be used to estimate the natural frequency of owt monopile system further it is found as described later that the use of timoshenko beam theory does not significantly improve the accuracy of static linear monopile response over that obtained by using the euler bernoulli beam theory 2 analysis framework static loading with nonlinear elastic soil the analysis framework described in the previous section is extended to incorporate soil nonlinearity the applied dynamic forces from various sources are modeled as equivalent static forces acting at the monopile head the monopile is modeled using the euler bernoulli beam theory because it is shown as described later that the use of euler bernoulli beam theory produces optimal solutions balancing accuracy and run time the soil behavior is characterized by a nonlinear elastic stress strain relationship that describes the reduction of secant shear modulus of soil with generated soil shear strain the objective of developing the nonlinear static analysis is to demonstrate that the use of nonlinear elastic soil constitutive models can produce sufficiently accurate monopile response and therefore these models can be used for designing monopile foundations based on the sls criterion in the nonlinear analysis the soil is characterized by a nonlinear elastic hyperbolic relationship developed by vardanega and bolton 2013 for clays based on the shear stress strain data of undrained fine grained soils reported in the literature a database of 67 tests on 21 clays and plastic silts for use in foundation engineering practice the compiled test data includes fine grained soils from various countries under a variety of conditions from normally consolidated to heavily overconsolidated and performed on a variety of shear testing devices over a period of 30 years the hyperbolic equation relating the secant shear modulus g s of clayey soil to the octahedral engineering shear strain γ oct of the soil is given by 14 g s g s 0 1 γ o c t γ r e f α where g s0 is the initial small strain shear modulus of clayey soil γ ref j pi 1000 with j 2 2 and pi is the plasticity index of soil expressed as a fraction is the octahedral reference shear strain at which the initial shear modulus g s0 is halved and the exponent α 0 736 is the curvature parameter describing the nonlinear variation of shear modulus with γ oct given by 15 γ o c t 2 3 ε r r ε θ θ 2 ε θ θ ε z z 2 ε z z ε r r 2 6 ε r θ 2 ε θ z 2 ε z r 2 in which ε rr ε θθ ε zz ε rθ ε θz and ε zr are the components of the soil strain tensor in r θ z coordinate system the strain induced nonlinearity described in equation 14 makes the soil surrounding the monopile heterogeneous even within each layer because the induced soil strains and the reduced soil shear modulus are different at different points in the soil therefore the differential equations for the nonlinear analysis are different from those of the linear elastic static analysis and are given by 16 e p i p d 4 w d z 4 2 t s z d 2 w d z 2 k s z w 0 17a d 2 φ r d r 2 γ 1 d φ r d r γ 2 φ r

z φ r 2 cos 2 θ φ θ 2 sin 2 θ r d r d θ in equations 18a 18b λ s r θ and g s r θ are spatial functions and remain within the integrals unlike those in the linear elastic analysis as the entire soil mass is assumed to be heterogeneous explicit soil layering is no longer essential in the analysis because the values of the lame s constants are different at different points in the entire soil domain either because of soil layering or because of induced soil strains or both and the initial small strain values of these elastic constants at these points have to be given as part of the input irrespective of the presence of soil layers at the actual site consequently a domain consisting of a single soil layer with heterogeneous properties is assumed the boundary conditions for equation 16 are given by 19a e p i p d 3 w d z 3 z 0 2 t s 0 d w d z z 0 f a 19b e p i p d 2 w d z 2 z 0 m a 19c e p i p d 3 w d z 3 z l p 2 t s l p d w d z z l p 2 k s l p t s l p π 2 r p 2 g s 0 z l p w z l p

17a 17b simultaneously as these are coupled equations with the boundary conditions φ r r p φ θ r p 1 and φ r φ θ 0 the soil domain is discretized in the r direction see fig 2 to perform the fd analysis solutions of differential equations 16 and 17 are obtained using the fd method following an iterative algorithm the monopile is discretized along the z direction with a set of nodes with uniform spacing of δz to solve equation 16 from each monopile node radially outward discretization is made along different radial directions such that the tangential angle δθ is maintained constant between two adjacent radial discretization lines at any depth z the radial discretization is used for solving equations 17a 17b and for numerical integrations of k s and t s non uniform discretization along r with r l 1 r l r l r l 1 where the subscript l represents the node number at a radial distance r l from the monopile edge was found to be more efficient numerically without compromising accuracy the radial discretization directions are maintained the same at different depths so that all the radial discretization lines along any given θ lie in the same vertical plane fig 2 because equations 16 and 17 are one dimensional in nature ordinary differential equations in z or r the numerical algorithm is much faster than that of conventional 3 d analysis in order to obtain the nonlinear load displacement response of piles the load is applied in increments at the beginning of each load increment an initial guess of 1 0 is made for γ 1 γ 8 at each radial node in the soil domain and equations 17a 17b are solved iteratively following the fd method after obtaining φ r and φ θ at different discretized radial distance r l the soil strain components are calculated at each discretized node from which the octahedral shear strain γ oct is calculated at each node using equation 15 subsequently the secant shear modulus g s r θ is evaluated at each node using equation 14 based on the value of γ oct g s r θ φ r and φ θ calculated at the different nodes are then used to obtain k si and t si at each ith node in the z direction following equations 18a 18b by performing numerical integrations along r and θ with the calculated values of k si and t si equation 16 is solved using the fd method to obtain w i and dw i dz at each node along the z axis the calculated values of w i and dw i dz are then used along with the calculated values of g s r θ and λ s r θ to obtain the parameters m s1 m s2 m s3 n s1 and n s2 at different nodes in the radial direction following equations 21a 21e by performing numerical integrations along θ and z after obtaining m s1 m s2 m s3 n s1 and n s2 new values of γ 1 γ 8 are evaluated at each radial node using equations 20a 20h and compared with the corresponding assumed initial values if the differences in the assumed and obtained values of γ 1 γ 8 are more than the prescribed tolerable limit of 0 001 at each node the calculations described so far are repeated with the calculated values of γ 1 γ 8 as the new initial guesses iterations are continued until the values of γ 1 γ 8 between successive iterations fall below the prescribed limit at each node after convergence on γ 1 γ 8 is reached the calculated values of w and dw dz are accepted as the final values for that load increment and the next load increment is applied successive load increments are applied and the iterative process described above is repeated to obtain convergence on γ 1 γ 8 for each load increment until the full applied load is reached 3 results 3 1 accuracy of linear analysis framework to demonstrate the accuracy of the linear dynamic analysis framework a comparison of normalized complex dynamic pile head stiffnesses obtained from the present analysis is made with those of novak and nogami 1977 novak and nogami 1977 analyzed a solid reinforced concrete free head pile with pile base encased in a rigid layer i e the pile base is fixed with zero displacements and rotation the pile soil inputs for the analysis are l p r p 20 e p 28 gpa ν p 0 2 relative pile soil stiffness ratio e p g s 3 103 ν s 0 25 λ s 1 5g s pile soil density ratio ρ p ρ s 1 25 and ξ s 0 025 figures 3a 3c show the complex dimensionless pile head stiffnesses for swaying coupled swaying rocking and rocking motions as functions of the applied dimensionless frequency a 0 ωr p v s where v s g s ρ s is the shear wave velocity of soil the real part of the complex pile head stiffnesses represents the stiffness and the imaginary part represents the damping present in the system because of both material and radiation damping fig 3 a shows the complex stiffness k r r for swaying motion in a normalized form k r r l p 3 e p i p fig 3 b shows the complex stiffness k r ψ for coupled swaying rocking motion in a normalized form k r ψ l p 2 e p i p note that the complex stiffness k r ψ and k ψ r are nearly equal and fig 3 c shows the complex stiffness k ψ ψ for rocking motion in a normalized form k ψ ψ l p e p i p the match between the results obtained from the present analysis with those by novak and nogami 1977 is reasonably well in the present analysis the complex stiffnesses obtained using the timoshenko beam theory is nearly identical to those obtained using the euler bernoulli beam theory for the range of dimensionless frequency investigated which implies that the effect of rotatory inertia and shear deformation included in the timoshenko beam theory is not of much significance fig 4 shows the dynamic pile head stiffness normalized with respect to the corresponding static stiffness for the swaying mode of vibration k r r a 0 k r r a 0 0 k a 0 2 j ξ s r a 0 the imaginary part ξ s r is a summation of the frequency dependent radiation damping ξ r and frequency independent material damping ξ s versus the applied dimensionless frequency a 0 the pile is a fixed head large diameter shaft of solid circular cross section with slenderness ratio l p r p 14 relative pile soil stiffness ratio e p g s 280 and ν p 0 2 embedded in a homogeneous linear viscoelastic soil with ν s 0 4 pile soil density ratio ρ p ρ s 1 25 and ξ s 0 05 and with the pile base resting on top of a rigid layer a good match is obtained between the results obtained from the present dynamic analysis with those of mylonakis 2001 who analyzed the same problem the timoshenko and euler bernoulli beam theories from the present analysis produce nearly identical results for the range of dimensionless frequency investigated a comparison of the results obtained from the present dynamic analysis following the rigid beam theory is performed with the results of a 3 d fe analysis by varun et al 2009 in which the pile is modeled as a massless i e ρ p 0 rigid element with solid circular cross section embedded in a linear viscoelastic three layer soil deposit with ξ si 0 fig 5 a and b show the maximum pile head displacement w h and rotation ψ h respectively as functions of the applied dimensionless frequency a 0 ωr p v s1 where v s1 is the shear wave velocity of the topsoil layer of the pile the details of the pile dimensions and soil properties are shown in the figures the figures show a good agreement between the results of the present analysis and those of the 3 d fe analysis performed by varun et al 2009 next a comparison fig 6 of the results obtained following all the beam theories is made with those of 3 d fe analysis performed using the software package abaqus for the comparison a hollow circular steel monopile with l p 30 m r p 5 m and t p 106 4 mm is considered to be embedded in a three layered linear elastic soil deposit with g s1 6 25 mpa and ν s1 0 2 g s2 9 62 mpa and ν s2 0 3 and g s3 13 46 mpa and ν s3 0 3 for the top middle and bottom layers respectively the thickness of each soil layer is reported in the figure itself the applied force f a 8 mn and moment m a 60 mnm are static in nature it is evident that the timoshenko euler bernoulli and rigid beam theories produce monopile displacements quite close to that of 3 d fe analysis however the monopile rotation is significantly underestimated following the rigid beam theory while the timoshenko beam theory provides the best results because it accounts for the effect of shear deformation within the monopile cross section unlike the euler bernoulli beam theory because the timoshenko beam theory captures the shear deformation within the monopile cross section sudden changes in shear force and shear deformation at the interfaces of adjacent soil layers caused by mismatch between soil young s moduli of adjacent layers are reflected in the sudden changes of timoshenko beam slope rotation because shear deformation and slope are related in the timoshenko beam theory see fig 6 b 3 2 appropriateness of dynamic analysis and beam theories for monopiles although owt structures are subjected to dynamic lateral loads it is possible that the inertia of the monopile soil system and the corresponding damping hysteretic material damping plus radiation damping because of wave propagation in the soil may not have any significant contribution to the monopile response because the applied loading frequencies are less than 1 hz static analysis might be sufficient to obtain the monopile soil stiffness further it is evident from the foregoing results that the timoshenko and euler bernoulli beam theories produce nearly identical monopile soil stiffness moreover monopiles have also been found to undergo rigid body motion therefore investigations on the necessity of dynamic analysis and on the suitability of beam theories in simulating the monopile response and obtaining monopile soil stiffness are performed next four different cases of monopiles currently supporting owts at different sites across europe table 1 are considered the monopile dimensions l p r p and t p are reported in table 1 and e p 210 gpa ν p 0 3 and ρ p 7850 kg m3 are chosen to characterize the steel monopile the soil young s modulus e s at different wind farm sites are obtained from shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 and typical values of other soil properties ν s 0 25 ρ s 1700 kg m3 and ξ s 0 05 are assumed for the purpose of investigation reasonable values of the amplitude of applied loading f 0 and m 0 are assumed and the maximum dimensionless frequency a 0 ωr p v s where v s is the shear wave velocity of the top soil layer and ω 2πf in which f is the applied loading frequency in hz for each of the wind farm sites is adopted from adhikari and bhattacharya 2012 table 1 table 1 shows the maximum monopile head displacement w h and head rotation ψ h obtained from the dynamic and static analyses following the three different beam theories it is evident from table 1 that the dynamic responses obtained using the three beam theories are always greater than the corresponding static responses a maximum difference of 4 7 in w h and 4 8 in ψ h are obtained between the dynamic and corresponding static responses considering all the wind farm sites table 2 shows the comparison of the dynamic and static stiffnesses for all the wind farm sites obtained using all the three beam theories it is evident from the comparison that for forcing frequencies less than 1 hz static stiffness is sufficient to evaluate the natural frequency of the owt structure the computational times required to obtain monopile responses using the dynamic and static analyses with the three different beam theories for all the four wind farm sites are given in table 3 the time required to run a dynamic analysis is approximately three times that of the corresponding static analysis therefore for monopiles supporting owts subjected to loading frequencies less than 1 hz static analysis can be used to quickly obtain monopile soil stiffnesses the rigid beam theory produces the fastest monopile response however the timoshenko and euler bernoulli beam theories produce much better estimates of the monopile response the timoshenko beam theory takes the longest to produce results a comparison of the percent difference in the static responses obtained using the euler bernoulli and rigid beam theories with respect to those obtained using the timoshenko beam theory for the four wind farm sites is shown in table 4 it is evident that the percent difference is the maximum for the rigid theory this is because the rigid theory is strictly applicable to monopiles when the relative monopile soil stiffness ratio e p g s 105 g s g s 1 0 75ν s and the slenderness l p r p is in the range of 5 20 gupta and basu 2018a therefore careful consideration of e p g s and l p r p is required for using the rigid beam theory for monopiles further for all the cases studied the percent difference in responses between the timoshenko and euler bernoulli beam theories is approximately 3 for w h and 9 for ψ h although the timoshenko beam theory gives a better prediction of ψ h which is the design criterion for monopiles the difference is typically less than 10 considering the facts related to accuracy and computational time described in tables 1 4 it can be reasonably concluded that static analysis is sufficient and optimal for obtaining monopile response and monopile soil stiffness further the widely used euler bernoulli beam theory can produce reliable monopile displacement and monopile soil stiffness without any significant loss of accuracy 3 3 accuracy of nonlinear analysis framework the accuracy of the nonlinear static analysis framework is checked by comparing monopile responses obtained using the present framework with those obtained from 3 d nonlinear fe analyses in which the same nonlinear constitutive relationship described by equation 14 is given as input additionally validation of the nonlinear analysis with respect to full scale field pile load tests is done fig 7 a b show the comparison of monopile responses pile head displacement w h and pile head rotation ψ h obtained from the present and 3 d fe analyses for an applied force and moment respectively the soil deposit is assumed to follow equation 14 with γ ref 0 002 the details of the pile soil inputs are given in the figure the initial small strain shear modulus g s0 20 mpa and ν s 0 49 are given as input to the analysis the monopile head responses from the present analysis and 3 d fe analysis match very closely the computational times required are approximately 8600 s and 330 s for the fe analysis and present analysis respectively in a computer with intel core i5 3210m cpu 2 50 ghz and 8 gb ram similar other comparisons were performed with excellent match between the results of 3 d fe analysis and present analysis and similar contrasting run times were observed gupta 2018 thus the present nonlinear analysis framework is as accurate as the 3 d nonlinear fe analysis framework but computationally one order of magnitude more efficient fig 8 shows the load versus pile head displacement w h obtained from the present nonlinear analysis and from the field load test of a stubby reinforced concrete pile at a los angeles test site bhushan et al 1979 the soil at the test site consists of overconsolidated sandy clay of medium to high plasticity with an average undrained shear strength s u 143 7 kpa vallahban and alikhanlou 1982 and plasticity index pi 30 bhushan et al 1979 for the comparison the initial small strain young s modulus e s0 49 8 mpa is evaluated based on the ratio e s0 s u 347 usace 1990 with g

applied at a height h c 0 23 m above the ground surface fig 9 shows the comparison of pile head displacement w h obtained from the present analysis with that of a lateral load test performed on a steel pipe pile at sabine texas test site matlock 1970 the p y analysis result of the same field problem reported by reese et al 1974 and based on the api 2011 recommended p y curves is also presented in the figure matlock 1970 the soil at the site consists of lightly overconsolidated soft clay for which the overconsolidation ratio ocr is assumed to be 1 5 following the recommendation of wu et al 1997 with s u 14 4 kpa and pi 68 guo 2013 such that γ ref 2 2 0 68 1000 0 001496 for the comparison e s0 3 9 mpa is evaluated based on the ratio e s0 s u 270 usace 1990 such that g s0 1 3 mpa for ν s 0 49 it is evident from figs 8 and 9 that the present nonlinear elastic analysis framework is capable of predicting pile responses in the field quite well the p y analysis fig 9 may sometimes fail to correctly predict the pile response because it is based on site specific semi empirical input parameters and does not account for the true 3 d pile soil interaction 3 4 appropriateness of nonlinear elastic analysis elasto plastic fe analysis is sometimes used to determine the nonlinear response of monopiles abdel rahman and achmus 2005 haiderali and madabhushi 2013 while analysis with the use of a proper elasto plastic soil constitutive model may produce accurate monopile response the time required for such analysis is often very high therefore it would be interesting to find out what benefit an elasto plastic analysis may have over the present nonlinear elastic analysis results obtained from the present nonlinear elastic analysis are compared with 3 d elasto plastic analysis for large diameter monopiles the monopile head rotation ψ h design criterion for monopiles supporting owts obtained from the present analysis is compared with the response obtained from 3 d fe analysis performed using abaqus in which the mohr coulomb soil constitutive model is used fig 8 three different monopiles with radius r p 2 0 3 0 and 3 75 m are chosen with e p 210 gpa ν p 0 3 ρ p 7850 kg m3 l p 35 m and t p 6 35 2 r p 100 mm api 2011 and the lateral load is applied at a height h c 36 2 m above the ground surface the monopiles are assumed to be embedded in a heavily overconsolidated stiff undrained clay deposit in which the clay deposit is characterized by s u 100 kpa pi 38 and ocr 2 5 such that g s0 16 1 mpa for ν s 0 49 mpa usace 1990 recommendations and γ ref j pi 1000 2 2 0 38 1000 0 00084 in the 3 d fe analysis the monopile soil interface is modeled using the finite sliding surface to surface master slave contact formulation with a normal hard contact allowing separation and no separation after contact and a tangential contact for which a typical friction coefficient of 0 25 for the clay steel interface lemos and vaughan 2000 is given as input it is evident from fig 10 that the present analysis using nonlinear elastic constitutive relationship is capable of predicting sufficiently accurate monopile response there is not much gain in accuracy achieved by using the mohr coulomb elasto plastic model further the effect of pile soil separation is not of much significance for monopiles with a maximum head rotation of 0 5 sls design criterion the computational times required are approximately 11500 s for the 3 d elasto plastic fe analysis and 500 s for the present nonlinear elastic analysis which further confirms that the present nonlinear analysis provides the optimal solution 3 5 application of developed analysis framework to design of a monopile from a geotechnical engineering design perspective a monopile supporting an owt should satisfy two design criteria i ultimate limit state uls criterion of collapse against the applied lateral and axial loads and ii serviceability limit state sls criterion of maximum allowable head rotation ψ h 0 5 at the seabed under extreme lateral loads dnv 2014 it is reported in the literature that the effect of the axial loads on the lateral response of monopiles supporting owts is negligible haiderali and madabhushi 2013 arany et al 2015 therefore in design the monopile is generally assumed safe against axial loads which arises primarily from the self weight of the wind turbine tower the turbine and the substructure assembly for monopiles the allowable head rotation is often the governing design criterion i e the design is based on sls criterion rather than the uls criterion therefore in this study design of a monopile under extreme loading conditions is performed following the sls criterion of ψ h 0 5 installation tolerances are neglected and the monopile is designed based on the maximum allowable head rotation the steps in the present design are i evaluation of the maximum lateral loads on the owt structure which are transferred to the monopile head at the seabed ii evaluation of the geotechnical inputs of soil of the selected site and iii using the inputs obtained from i and ii in the static nonlinear elastic analysis to select appropriate monopile dimensions that satisfy ψ h 0 5 apart from obtaining the monopile dimensions that satisfy the sls the static elastic stiffnesses k r r k r ψ and k ψ ψ of the monopile soil system are also determined which can be used to evaluate the natural frequency of the owt monopile system a design requirement for the owt the aspect of degradation of soil stiffness caused by long term cyclic loads is kept outside the scope of the design because of the lack of proper quantification of the stiffness degradation in the literature it should be noted that the analysis framework can be naturally extended to incorporate the cyclic stiffness degradation with a proper soil constitutive model representing the field cyclic behavior of the monopile soil system 3 6 evaluation of maximum lateral loads acting on the owt structure the wind turbine structure is subjected to dynamic lateral loads from wind waves water currents and vibrations from the rotor and blades fig 11 the dynamic loads on the wind turbine structure from water currents rotor and blades are very small compared with the wind and wave loads lombardi 2010 arany et al 2015 hence the dynamic loads from water currents rotor and blades are neglected in the present design the dynamic loads on the wind turbine structure arising from wind and wave are modeled as equivalent static horizontal force f a and overturning moment m a at the monopile head 3 7 maximum lateral load from wind according to the dnv 2014 code there are numerous wind load scenarios which should be analyzed to design the owt monopile system in this design the wind force is evaluated when an extreme gust hits the rotor at the hub level fig 11 at a rated wind speed u r dnv 2014 arany et al 2015 2017 the dnv code provides the following equation for the calculation of extreme gust u ext

f a f wind f wave and m a m wind m wave at the monopile head because of the wind and wave actions assuming that the wind and wave loads are collinear as per dnv 2014 recommendations a monopile radius r p 2 5 m is assumed in the calculation of wave load which is a function of monopile radius 3 9 evaluation of geotechnical inputs the monopile is considered to be embedded in a homogeneous slightly overconsolidated undrained soft clay deposit equation 14 is used to model the nonlinear soil behavior the soil inputs in the analysis are given in table 8 3 10 monopile dimensions in this design the monopile is modeled following the euler bernoulli beam theory the monopile wall thickness t p american petroleum institute api 2011 and second moment of inertia i p which are inputs in the analysis are evaluated from 26a t p 6 35 2 r p 100 26b i p π 4 r p 4 r p t p 4 for r p 2 5 m t p 56 35 mm and i p 2 67 m4 the monopile embedment length l p which can effectively resist f a and m a is obtained following the gl 2005 recommendations for offshore piles under extreme static loading conditions gl 2005 outlines the following set of criteria for estimating l p i the vertical tangent criterion i e displacement profile of the monopile has vertical tangent at the toe ii zero toe kick criterion i e zero or no negative displacement at the monopile toe or base should be maintained and iii critical pile length criterion the monopile length is such that any further increase in the length has little or no effect on the pile head response achmus et al 2009 and kuo et al 2011 found that the criteria i and ii are very conservative and result in very large embedment lengths hence these criteria are unsuitable for monopile design therefore in the present design l p is evaluated following criterion iii for the selection of the appropriate monopile embedment length several guesses of l p are made such that ψ h 0 5 the monopile response for each guess from the present nonlinear elastic analysis is reported in table 9 it is evident from table 9 that for an applied loading of f a 3 8 mn and m a 120 96 mnm table 7 at the monopile head with r p 2 5 m a design length l p 30 m can be used however following criterion iii of gl 2005 described in the preceding paragraph l p 40 m should be used because an increase in l p beyond 40 m has little or no impact on ψ h finally for the design monopile length l p 40 m and radius r p 2 5 m the elastic static stiffnesses k r r 0 5137 gn m k r ψ 3 8551 gn rad and k ψ ψ 72 5919 gnm rad are evaluated from the analysis these stiffnesses can be used to evaluate the natural frequency of the owt monopile system 4 conclusions a new continuum based analysis framework for offshore wind turbine monopile foundations is presented the framework has two main parts 1 dynamic analysis with linear viscoelastic soil and 2 static analysis with nonlinear elastic soil in the dynamic analysis the soil is modeled as a linear viscoelastic continuum and the monopile is modeled using the timoshenko beam theory the monopile is subjected to harmonic loads at the head it is shown that the analysis can be progressively simplified to model the monopile using the euler bernoulli and rigid beam theories the dynamic analysis framework can be simplified to analyze monopiles embedded in linear elastic soil and subjected to static loads the linear static analysis is further extended to develop a framework for nonlinear static analysis of monopiles in which the soil is modeled as a nonlinear elastic continuum the monopile is modeled using the euler bernoulli beam theory and the dynamic loads on the owt structure are modeled as equivalent static loads at the monopile head the accuracy of the analysis framework is ensured by comparing the results obtained from the present analysis with those obtained from other numerical studies available in the literature 3 d finite element analyses performed as part of the present study and field pile load tests the dynamic analysis framework is used to investigate i which beam theory is most suitable for simulation of monopile response and ii what type of monopile soil stiffness dynamic or static is appropriate for calculating the natural frequency of the owt monopile system it is found that static analysis in which the soil is modeled as a linear elastic continuum and monopile is modeled using the euler bernoulli beam theory is optimal for obtaining sufficiently accurate monopile soil stiffness required for calculation of natural frequency of owt monopile system the nonlinear analysis framework in which the applied loads are static and the soil is nonlinear elastic is used to investigate whether such an analysis is sufficient to design monopiles against the serviceability limit state criterion of ψ h 0 5 or more sophisticated elasto plastic analysis is required it is found that the present analysis produces monopile response accurately and quickly and no significant gain in accuracy is obtained by treating the soil as an elasto plastic continuum thus the developed nonlinear elastic framework can be conveniently used for monopile design finally a step by step design of a monopile is performed using the newly developed analysis framework in the design it is shown i how the dynamic loads on the owt structure from wind and waves can be evaluated as equivalent static loads under extreme conditions based on the recommendations of dnv 2014 and ii how appropriate monopile dimensions can be selected using the developed analysis framework based on the criteria set in gl 2005 and dnv 2014 that can effectively resist the applied loads the aspect of cyclic degradation of soil stiffness over the life cycle of monopiles is not considered in the design overall the paper provides insights and perspectives on monopile analysis and design that are expected to be of benefit to the profession credit authorship contribution statement bipin k gupta conceptualization methodology

21627,this paper evaluates the propeller wake characteristics of the benchmark ship propeller insean e779a using large eddy simulations and identifies instability mechanisms that lead to wake breakdown the effects of propeller blade loading on wake stability are considered by conducting simulations at different advance coefficients j 0 85 j 0 65 and j 0 45 the hydrodynamic results capture the propeller wake vortical structures and flow features from the onset and evolution of the instability to the far wake the simulation results are verified and validated against experimental measurements from the literature a new instability mechanism concerning mutual interaction among adjacent helical vortex sheets in the transition region is identified further the formation of short wave instabilities in the vortex filaments is found to be initiated by the same mutual interactions among sheets lastly it is shown that interaction of sheets with the preceding tip vortex induces the onset of tip vortical filaments breakup mutual interaction and long wave instability keywords cfd les ship propeller wake tip vortex hub vortex helical vortex sheets 1 introduction of all components on maritime vessels the propeller is one of the most important propeller hydrodynamics affects ship power characteristics noise generation as well as many aspects of ship operability with experimental testing often cost prohibitive the ability to perform expedient numerical simulations for understanding propeller hydrodynamics is essential for maritime vessel design and operation a propeller creates thrust by generating lift from its blades hydrofoil cross sections as they rotate water is accelerated aft of the propeller because of the pressure difference between suction and pressure sides of the blade propelling the vessel forward unlike fans and aircraft propellers a ship propeller operates at low rotational speeds using blades with larger chords and more complex geometry these blade shapes are necessary to provide high thrust and to prevent cavitation these and other factors such as wake instabilities lead to complex flow phenomenon the propeller wake is composed of vortical structures shed from the blade trailing edges that roll up because of pressure difference across the front and back surfaces of the blade as a result two vortical filaments are formed one at the tip and the other at root sections of the blade these are called the tip and the hub vortices respectively in addition there is a sheet of vorticity shed from the entire trailing edge due to varying circulation over the blade radius and the boundary layer which we will call the helical vortex sheets the propeller wake has three regions containing distinct flow phenomenon felli 2007 a near wake region about one propeller radius where the wake evolves rolls up and undergoes a slipstream contraction next is the transition region where the wake vortical structures slowly destabilize the final region is known as the far wake region where the wake breaks down completely the mechanisms leading to evolution contraction and breakdown of these vortical structures shed from a ship propeller are not completely understood and are a major focus of this paper joukowski 1912 proposed a pioneering propeller wake theoretical model by considering constant circulation along a lifting line resulting in the wake consisting of finite core helical tip vortices from each blade and a single rectilinear hub vortex of opposing strength widnall 1972 investigated the stability of a single helical vortex filament with respect to spatial perturbations she used inviscid linear stability analysis to show that an isolated helical vortex filament has three modes of instabilities short wave long wave and mutual inductance for short wave instabilities perturbations are inside the vortex cores with wavelengths on the order of the core radius for long wave instabilities the perturbations displace the whole vortex filament with wavelengths much larger than the core radius and mutual inductance occurs when neighboring filaments interact with decreasing helix pitch gupta and loewy 1974 bhagwat and leishman 2000 okulov 2004 and okulov and sørensen 2007 extended the theoretical analysis to systems of filaments with the later study including the helical vortex sheets and the hub vortex importantly okulov and sørensen 2007 concluded that joukowski s model joukowski 1912 is unconditionally unstable and that helical vortex sheets must be incorporated to formulate a stable wake as observed in experiments this theoretical research is related to general rotor wake instabilities and is summarized in a recent review by leweke et al 2016 the instability modes as mentioned and predicted by theoretical approaches have been observed generally in numerical and experimental studies for rotors stella et al 2000 felli et al 2011 nemes et al 2015 muscari et al 2013 magionesi et al 2018 however felli et al 2011 experimentally observed some inconsistencies of the latest theoretical models okulov and sørensen 2010 2007 for predicting stability boundaries of ship propeller wakes for instance the velocity fields derived by the theoretical vorticity distributions did not match with experimental data felli et al 2011 also the theoretical models suggest that the wake behind a rotor should breakdown at the same distance if the tip vortex intensity remains the same however when felli et al 2011 decreased the number of blades the wake break down occurred further downstream with this effect observed at low to high advance coefficients experimentally many ship propeller wake instabilities have been investigated in studies carried out using the benchmark propeller insean e779a felli et al 2011 2007 2006 di felice et al 2004 stella et al 2000 earlier works focused on general wake characteristics loukakis 1971 kerwin 1976 min 1978 kobayashi 1982 jessup 1989 issues such as the effects of loading number of propeller blades vortex filament mutual interaction the interaction of the blade with the ship s wake and the effect of spiralling along the hub vortex leading to tip vortex destabilization have been raised and studied to varying extents in recent works di felice et al 2009 2004 felli et al 2011 2008 2007 2006 regarding instability instigating mechanisms di felice et al 2004 observed the interaction of helical vortex sheets with the preceding tip vortex later felli et al 2006 using pressure velocity correlations inferred that this interaction caused the onset of instabilities due to experimental challenges most earlier works were limited to the near wake and velocity measurements along transversal planes while later di felice et al 2004 and felli et al 2006 also analyzed along longitudinal planes though still limited till the transition region in 2011 felli et al 2011 carried out landmark three dimensional wake experiments and concluded that the mutual inductance mode which occurs among adjacent helical tip vortical filaments forms the basis of marine propeller wake instabilities detached eddy simulation des was later used to simulate the wake of the same propeller e779a muscari et al 2013 di mascio et al 2014 guilmineau et al 2015 in these studies muscari et al 2013 and guilmineau et al 2015 while comparing des against reynolds averaged navier stokes rans concluded that although rans methods predict thrust and torque coefficients satisfactorily higher fidelity approaches such as des and les are required to capture the wake vortical structures di mascio et al 2014 analyzed wake dynamics using des in an oblique flow and concluded that for such conditions secondary vortical structures with the tip vortices leading to earlier wake breakdown as compared to uniform inflow conditions bensow and liefvendahl 2008 studied the effect of implicit and explicit subgrid modelling in les to evaluate the flow around e779a propeller while recognizing the need for additional simulations with refined meshes for a comprehensive evaluation recently large eddy simulation les has been employed to simulate a marine propeller wake specifically to study its geometric characteristics kumar and mahesh 2017 kumar and mahesh 2017 stated that the attraction and interaction between tip vortex and adjacent helical sheet vortices plays an important role in the development of wake instabilities however the actual instability mechanism depends on propeller and flow characteristics in this regard the propeller used in their work kumar and mahesh 2017 shed weak tip vortices and the far field breakup of tip vortical filaments could not be visualized magionesi et al 2018 extended an earlier work where the flow field was obtained using des muscari et al 2013 to modal analyses for the benchmark insean e779a propeller it was found that at a lower advance coefficient j 0 38 the most significant energetic modes associated with the wake destabilization mechanisms describe the pairing of the tip vortices and the subsequent distortion of tip vortical filaments however for relatively higher advance coefficient j 0 71 no significant instability could be identified due to the propeller wake remaining stable over the length of the computational domain considered posa et al 2019 contended that the source of the smaller vortices seen in the sheet region by kumar and mahesh 2017 is different for their case of a highly loaded seven bladed propeller this literature review thus shows that a consensus regarding the mechanisms leading to ship propeller wake instabilities is yet to be reached although being researched theoretically experimentally and computationally a full understanding of the propeller wake behavior remains elusive specifically when and how instabilities start to commence how helical vortex sheets interact with tip vortices the interaction of tip vortical filaments before final breakdown and the influence of the hub vortex are still open questions in this paper hydrodynamic analyses are performed using large eddy simulation les to gain a better understanding of propeller wake flow physics in the first part of the paper les is used to provide a description of the propeller wake geometry and related hydrodynamics in the second part mechanisms leading to wake breakdown are studied and identified the simulations consist of numerical tests similar to that performed in experimental facilities for the evaluation of propeller wake characteristics validation of the hydrodynamic simulations is completed by comparison with experimental data available for propeller e779a di felice et al 2004 felli et al 2011 2007 salvatore et al 2006 the assessment of results along with the les capturing of flow field vortex formation and wake instabilities are discussed 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations the turbulent flow over propellers and the subsequent wake breakdown mechanisms are difficult to estimate using ideal flow theory or other theoretical approximations to account for all propeller hydrodynamics three dimensional unsteady incompressible and viscous turbulent flow must be considered for such flows the incompressible continuity and navier stokes equations are given by 1 x i ρ u i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u l x l in equations 1 and 2 above u i and u j are the instantaneous components of velocity p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density μ is the dynamic viscosity and δ i j is the kronecker delta in les a spatial filtering function separates the turbulent flow into larger eddies which are resolved and smaller eddies that are modelled using an appropriate sub grid scale sgs model the filtering function thus depends on the mesh size in particular regions of the computational domain for any flow characteristics variable φ such as pressure velocity etc the filtering operation leads to a filtered field defined by variable φ and a sub grid scale field defined by φ as follows 3 φ φ φ this work utilizes ansys fluent 2016 to solve the les equations here the finite volume method provides the filter function and the corresponding filtered variable φ is calculated from volume v of the mesh cell as 4 φ x 1 v v φ x d x x v to resolve the relevant turbulent eddies the filtered continuity and navier stokes equations used for les are 5 x i ρ u i 0 6 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u l x l x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j the essential flow statistics contained in the larger eddies are thus resolved and the les convergence towards the exact solution can be increased by refining the mesh size depending on available resources in general the effects of the sub grid residual structures are not completely discarded and appear as an additional term in the filtered navier stokes equation 6 these sgs stresses τ i j are modelled using the boussinesq hypothesis 7 τ i j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 1 3 δ i j τ k k the residual stresses represented by τ k k being isotropic in nature do not require modelling and are added to filtered static pressure term the only parameter requiring modelling in equation 7 above is turbulent viscosity μ t the general mesh resolution guidelines for wall resolved les are δx 100 wall y 1 and δz 30 davidson 2009 this however increases the mesh size considerably for wall bounded flows in general and for propeller wake in particular if an isotropic mesh is desired for the length of the propeller wake to counter issues such as this shur et al 2008 proposed a hybrid model which couples a modified smagorinsky model c s m a g δ 2 with the prandtl van driest mixing length k d w 2 model and the associated wall damping function modified by piomelli et al 1988 in this approach the turbulent viscosity μ t is given as 8 μ t ρ v t min k d w 2 c s m a g δ 2 s 1 exp y 25 3 in the equation 8 the distance from the wall is represented by d w the subgrid length scale by δ and the strain rate by s while k 0 41 and c smag 0 2 are constants importantly δ which is usually taken as cubic root of the cell volume in general les is also improved to account for the grid anisotropies in the inner part of the logarithmic wall region this modified subgrid length scale is defined as 9 δ min max c w d w c w h m a x h w n h m a x in the equation 9 above h wn is the grid spacing in the wall normal direction h max is the maximum edge length for a mesh cell and c w 0 15 is an empirical constant evaluated from wall resolved les wrles as the grid normal to walls is usually finer than the other two directions in any wall bounded les the use of this modified subgrid length scale is advantageous not only for the wall modelled les wmles but can also be useful in general les with anisotropic grids and not involving an explicit filtering shur et al 2008 lastly blended functions enhanced with empirical data please see shur et al 2008 for details activate reynolds averaging but this sgs modelling is only in the inner part of the logarithmic layer while the outer part of the boundary layer is still resolved as the grid is refined near the wall more and more boundary layer turbulence is resolved such that for the limiting case of wrles mesh resolution only a very thin portion of the boundary layer is modelled the approach also resolves the problem of log layer mismatch which is common in other wmles methods still the wmles model cannot solve the transitional effects as the model does not provide zero eddy viscosity for flows with constant shear in the les portion therefore it is enhanced by addition of vorticity magnitude ω in the original formulation and named wmles s omega ansys 2016 this formulation is as given below 10 μ t ρ v t min k d w 2 c s m a g δ 2 a b s s ω 1 exp y 25 3 it is mentioned that typically a major part of the boundary layer on propeller blades may be laminar or transitional at the model scale dimensions especially if the low behind hull conditions mostly or critical reynolds number re regimes are applied in such a case sgs models such as wale nicoud and ducros 1999 considering both strain and vorticity appear to be the better choice ansys 2016 posa et al 2019 as compared to the dynamic smagorinsky lilly model germano et al 1991 lilly 1992 or the improved wmles s ω formulation as applied here however in the present case the re is considerably high re d nd 2 v 1 3 106 here and as per the ittc 2002 between re d 1 106 and 1 107 depending on propeller and j a fully developed turbulent boundary layer is established on both sides of the propeller blades notably felli et al 2011 showed the effect of re becomes negligible for this propeller e779a above a critical value with no difference between 25 rps as considered here and 30 rps while the difference between 25rps and 12rps was attributed to presence of laminar region at the lower rotational speed rijpkema et al 2015 also showed that for this same propeller as in the current work the flow at most of the blade region is turbulent for the high r e 0 7 r range as considered here especially at the higher j 0 7 case that they considered we are mainly focused here at a higher value j 0 85 j design and thus the flow at the blades can be considered mostly turbulent lastly it is also an objective of the current work to use the lowest mesh density possible aligned with the objective of ship industry use les as further acoustic computations are based on the same mesh therefore and to keep the total number of cells to a manageable number an optimized form of wmles based on the shur et al 2008 approach which is further enhanced with s ω formulation is employed in the current work for the sub grid scale modelling 2 2 test case the propeller selected for the analysis insean e779a was developed initially for a commercial ferry e779a has later evolved as a benchmark propeller with sufficient experimental data available in literature di felice et al 2004 felli et al 2011 2007 2006 salvatore et al 2006 stella et al 2000 the other reason for selecting this propeller is that being highly loaded at the tip it sheds strong tip vortices hence it is particularly suitable for the study of the wake instability and breakdown phenomena where the dynamics of the tip vortices play an important role e779a is a model scale four blade wageningen modified type right handed propeller with slight skew and fixed pitch and has the design advance coefficient j design of 0 83 the geometry and profiles of the propeller blades are as shown in fig 1 the primary dimensions of the insean e779a propeller and flow characteristics are as given in table 1 2 3 numerical setup the computational domain consists of a cylindrical region with diameter three times and length twelve times the propeller diameter respectively the computational domain is kept similar in size as in experiments for effective validation and is large enough so as to avoid blockage effects stella et al 2000 the boundary conditions are based on an incoming uniform flow into a revolving propeller at fixed rotational speed of 25 revolutions per second the complete computational domain including boundary conditions is shown in fig 2 below a hybrid mesh consisting of pyramids prism layers tetrahedral and hexahedral cells is used a fine triangular surface mesh is used on the propeller blades and surrounding regions to resolve the curvature of the blades in the streamwise and the spanwise directions prism layers are extruded from this surface mesh to create a very fine boundary layer mesh in the near wall region the cylindrical volume around the propeller is then meshed with tetrahedral cells the propeller blades prism layers and tetrahedral mesh are designated as a rotating mesh further an inner cylinder of fine isotropic cells extends approximately six propeller diameters further downstream to ensure that the coherent vortical structures are adequately resolved most of the cells are thus clustered in the region surrounding the propeller and its wake for better convergence effort is also made to create a mesh without skewed elements a section of the generated mesh is shown in fig 3 numerical verification based on the grid independence studies is performed to decide the appropriate size of the hybrid mesh the grid independence studies are performed at the highest and lowest loading conditions considered in the current analyses with the results presented in appendix a out of the three mesh sizes the finest mesh comprising approximately 24 million cells is selected this mesh has a streamwise resolution δx 250 wall normal resolution δy 1 and spanwise resolution of δz 250 on the propeller blades unsteady rans urans simulations are carried out initially with the shear stress transport sst k ω model used to model the turbulence for solution discretization initially first order schemes are employed and after a stable solution is obtained second order upwind schemes are used the time discretization is also second order the flow fields from the converged urans simulations after about 15 propeller revolutions are then used to initialize the les analyses for les second order accurate central differencing discretization is used to discretize momentum and pressure while second order implicit is used for temporal discretization time step sizes used for les simulations are 1 1 38 10 5 s to keep the courant number generally under 0 3 the les solution becomes statistically steady judged by full development of wake vortical structures after about 10 propeller revolutions the averaging was carried out for a further 15 revolutions to simulate rigid body motion of the rotating propeller sliding meshes are employed all the cells in the fluid zone surrounding the propeller identified in fig 2 rotate relative to the adjacent stationary zones the zones are linked through non conformal mesh interfaces and the specified zone rotates as a whole as per the prescribed motion thus the cells within the rotating zone retain their geometry because of this rigid rotation and the mesh is not distorted at each time step the flow variables are interpolated across the non conformal interfaces the rotational speed of propeller is kept constant while different loading conditions are obtained by changing the incoming flow velocity the advance coefficient j used to define the loading condition is given as 11 j u n d in the equation above u is the free stream fluid velocity n is the propeller rotational speed and d is the diameter of the propeller it is important to note that at lower advance coefficient the propeller is under heavy loading condition compared to a higher advance coefficient convergence of the solution is evaluated by observing the residuals of solution variables with residual convergence criterion set at 1 10 6 and by monitoring the forces and moments acting on the propeller the simulations are performed on a cluster of computers composed of 168 cores and 128 gb of ram in general using these resources it takes about one day of wall time to simulate a single complete revolution using wmles s ω formulation on the finest mesh of 24 million cells considered here 3 numerical validation this section describes quantitative and qualitative analyses of results along with numerical validation by comparison against experimental measurements from the literature the propeller wake simulations are performed at a total of five different loading conditions the details of which are given in the table below from the highest to lowest advance coefficient considered in the analyses the validation is performed by comparison against experimental performance and flow characteristics as available in literature three main advance coefficients j 0 85 0 65 and 0 45 are considered for instability mechanisms identifications in the present work at these advance coefficients experimental open water characteristics and flow visualizations are available in the literature for the e779a propeller and compared below however the wake flow field quantities such as vorticity and velocities in the tip vortex and blade wake region are readily available at two other advance coefficients j 0 75 and j 0 88 therefore simulations are also performed at advance coefficients j 0 75 and j 0 88 to enable comparison against experimental flow variables for a comprehensive validation as detailed in the proceeding section 3 1 propeller open water characteristics the propeller open water characteristics such as thrust kt and torque coefficients kq are calculated from axial forces t and rotational moments about axial axes q acting on the propeller blades these performance characteristics are defined by the following equations 12 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 13 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 fig 4 shows the propeller thrust and torque coefficients against various advance coefficients predicted with the current les analyses fig 4 also shows experimental thrust and torque coefficients for propeller e779a as measured by salvatore et al 2006 the smaller torque coefficient is multiplied by ten times for both approaches it can be seen that the les results are in good agreement with the experimental results 3 2 propeller flow field characteristics the e779a propeller wake consists of four helical tip vortical filaments four axial root vortex filaments combining into a thick hub vortex filament and four layers of helical vortex sheets the vortical filaments are visualized using the q criterion while helical vortex sheets are visualized through the vorticity contour plots the q criterion proposed by hunt et al 1988 is a galilean invariant vortex criterion which defines the vortex as a spatial region where vorticity magnitude ω is greater than the strain rate magnitude s this eulerian criterion also necessitates that the local pressure inside the vortex core is smaller than the surrounding pressure it is defined as 14 q 0 5 ω 2 s 2 0 15 where s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i and ω i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i fig 5 depicts propeller wake vortical structures obtained from the les using the iso surfaces of the q criterion and compared against vortical structures obtained from experiments performed by felli et al 2011 these figures show that les describes the propeller wake far better from its evolution to instability to final breakdown while rans could only capture a limited behaviour importantly at all the three different advance coefficients considered les captured wake vortical structures are remarkably similar to the experimentally observed ones some slight differences in individual filaments are due to the instantaneous visualizations but these are acceptable as will become clear in subsequent section 4 3 where complete filament cycles figs 23 and 24 are shown nevertheless and as observed in experiments the pitch of the tip vortex increases with the advance coefficient and the propeller wake destabilizes and breaks down further downstream mainly it is observed that at the lowest advance coefficient j 0 45 the tip vortical filaments collapse completely and soon after the onset of the instabilities this is followed by waves in the hub vortex and its breakup whereas at the medium advance coefficient j 0 65 tip vortical filaments break further downstream and experience mutual interactions with adjacent filaments for few revolutions before proceeding to complete collapse this is followed by twisting and the appearance of waves in the hub vortex and its breakup further downstream not shown at the highest advance coefficient j 0 85 the tip vortical filaments remain intact for a long way downstream and then even after breakup initiation continue to interact with adjacent filaments for a significant distance downstream before ultimately collapsing the hub vortex at j 0 85 experiences mainly filament twisting with waves only starting to appear towards the outlet of the computational domain fig 6 shows wave like disturbances travelling along the tip vortical filaments similar to those observed in experiments conducted by felli 2007 two types of waves appear in the tip vortical filaments with both increasing in amplitude with downstream distance at first smaller waves appear with wavelengths comparable to the size of the filament diameter and are associated with short wave instabilities widnall 1972 then bigger waves appear that displace the filaments as a whole and are associated with long wave instabilities widnall 1972 the les vorticity contours on the central longitudinal plane shown in fig 7 a also compare well with the experimental measurements obtained by felli 2007 reproduced here in fig 7b due to the boundary layer on the propeller blades the helical vortex sheets are composed of two layers each of opposing signs important insights into the mechanisms leading to the initiation of marine propellers wake instabilities will be inferred from analyses of the vorticity plots at different advance coefficients in the proceeding section quantitative evaluation of the flow field is made by a comparison of simulated mean tip vortex position mean tip vortex vorticity and velocities in the wake region with experimental measurements of the same quantities obtained by di felice et al 2004 fig 8 shows that the mean vorticity of the tip vortices predicted with the current simulations is in good agreement with the experimental measurements the vorticity in the tip vortex fig 8 decreases along the wake length and follows a linear trend fig 9 shows that the radial positions of the tip vortices downstream of the propeller also agree well with the experimental trend overall the radial position of the tip vortex fig 9 decreases along the wake length exponentially before flattening off at a stable value however further downstream the radial position of the tip vortices begin to oscillate as instabilities arise fig 9 suggests that the instability inception point predicted in the current work is different from that measured in the experiments of di felice et al 2004 however this apparent difference is attributed to instantaneous observations and angular positions of blades which may be different between the two approaches although the four tip vortical filaments breakup in near vicinity of each other each filament follows a slightly different path and length some break bit early some bit later and therefore different radial position at any instant in time the phase averaged results of the complete wake envelope are a more robust approach to identify the instability inception point and as will be seen later fig 27 these results show excellent agreement between current les and experimental instability inception point felli et al 2011 fig 10 shows the comparison of the phase averaged mean axial velocity at 0 2 x r downstream of the propeller disk on a line from the hub and through the tip vortex in the tip vortex region there is excellent agreement between the phase averaged mean axial velocity predicted with the present simulations and the experimental measurements in the helical sheet region the mean velocity predicted by the les is slightly higher about 6 than the measured values in the experiment nevertheless in both approaches it is seen that after staying almost uniform in the helical sheet region the axial velocity increases as it approaches the tip vortex region the velocity then decreases sharply within the tip vortex region before starting recovery after passing through the tip vortex overall a good degree of qualitative and quantitative agreement between the numerically predicted results and the experimental measurements has been achieved this validates the modelling approach used in the present work and gives confidence in the quality of the results presented in the remainder of the paper 4 propeller wake analyses before explicitly analyzing the near transition and far wake regions for identification of wake instabilities the general flow characteristics are presented and discussed the wake behaviour behind a specific propeller depends strongly on how heavily loaded the blades are the advance coefficient j is indicative of the propeller loading the lower the advance coefficient the greater the difference between incoming flow velocity and the propeller tip velocity and consequently the heavier the blade loading as seen in fig 5 the wake breaks down earlier at lower advance coefficients i e when the propeller is operating at higher loading the effects of incoming flow on the rotating propeller are shown in the distribution of pressure coefficient c p p p 0 5 ρ u 2 where p is the static pressure plots on the blades front and back surfaces as well as on the hub fig 11 on the suction side of propeller blades the incoming flow accelerates and consequently the pressure drops causing most of this face to be covered in negative pressure as seen in fig 11 a d g while the pressure side of the propeller blades has maximum pressure occurring at the leading edge as shown in fig 11 c f i overall pressure maxima and minima decrease with loading this also means that the pressure difference between two sides of the blades is greater at higher loading which results in larger pressure variations inside the tip vortex core at these lower advance coefficients in fig 12 axial velocity contours are shown at three different advance coefficients on the central longitudinal xy plane at z 0 the dominant velocity pattern between the tip and hub vortices is observed to have a high velocity region followed by a relatively lower velocity region termed the velocity defect this velocity defect represents the effect of the boundary layers on the propeller blades as the flow is accelerating aft of the propeller these velocity defect regions become increasingly inclined as they travel downstream further downstream the effect of turbulence diffusion is seen when comparing the behaviour at different loading conditions the velocity gradients are reduced in both the tip vortex region and hub vortex region with decreasing loading increasing advance coefficient also the velocity defect lines are less inclined at reduced loading conditions furthermore it is highlighted that although the distance between two neighboring tip vortices increases with increasing advance coefficient the distance between adjacent velocity defect regions appears to decrease with increasing advance coefficient at lowest advance coefficient fig 12 however a one to one pairing of velocity defect regions with tip vortices is not apparent also the lowest velocity occurs in the hub region especially at the start of the hub vortex where there is negative velocity with decreasing advance coefficient this region increases in size this near hub flow suction phenomenon generated by the hub vortex is similar to what is observed in experiments di felice et al 2004 the negative velocity is also observed in a very small region in the first tip vortex attached to the blade at the lowest advance coefficient lastly at higher advance coefficient the hub vortex is able to retain its original size and shape significantly downstream the power spectral density psd of transient axial velocity fluctuations over time is also shown in fig 13 at various axial locations it can be seen that the blade effect represented by peaks at bpf and harmonics is progressively reduced along the wake length fig 14 shows the pressure contours on the same xy plane at low medium and high advance coefficients the pressure inside the vortex cores reduces as the blade loading decreases with the maximum reduction occurring in the near wake and inside the hub vortex this pressure drop contributes to cavitation inception a phenomenon which severely damages propeller blades and effects noise generation as such it is desirous to delay cavitation inception speeds as much as possible in this regard it is observed that with increasing advance coefficient both the negative pressure and the pressure variation are reduced inside the vortex cores due to reduced loading as also noted in earlier experimental works tachmindji and dickerson 1957 felli et al 2006 the stronger pressure gradients and associated stronger tip vortical filaments at lower advance coefficients also contribute to increased noise generation at higher loading conditions sharma et al 1990 4 1 near wake analysis in the near wake region the propeller wake evolves and undergoes slip stream contraction this mainly occurs due to increased axial flow in the near wake satisfying continuity felli 2007 as depicted in fig 15 also in the near wake region helical vortex sheets follow their related tip vortex and remain relatively straight although they do experience an increasingly inclined pitch angle due to cross flow felli 2007 the near wake behaviour is moreover observed along transverse yz planes at different axial locations while taking into account increasing wake pitch angle with increasing advance coefficient figs 16 and 17 show normalized vorticity magnitude contours at three different advance ratios for the near wake at various x r ratios as can be seen from these figures the helical vortex sheets remain attached to their respective tip vortex in the near wake fig 16 shows that at lower advance coefficient the tip vortex appears evolving earlier as compared with medium and higher advance in addition a stronger tip vortex is shed at lower advance coefficient due to stronger flow gradients under higher loading conditions as seen in fig 17 4 2 transition wake analysis in the transition region the propeller wake undergoes gradual destabilization therefore it is an important region to identify mechanisms leading to propeller wake instabilities apart from the usual tip and hub vortices the helical vortex sheets connecting the tip vortices and the hub vortex are also visualized here adequately as shown in fig 18 j 0 85 fig 19 j 0 65 and fig 20 j 0 45 in the longitudinal planes while fig 21 shows the helical vortex sheets progression in the transverse planes at various advance coefficients progressive bending of these helical sheets as observed in experimental work of felli 2007 is also well resolved in the current simulations as highlighted in figs 18a and 21 the relevant tip vortex positions starting after the blade tips are also numbered and referenced accordingly to aid description of the instability inceptions some new mechanisms are identified in the transition wake regions that lead to propeller wake instabilities first at higher advance coefficients as highlighted in fig 18a clear mutual interaction between adjacent helical vortex sheets is observed shortly after the helical sheets start fragmenting into smaller vortical structures helical sheet vortices this mutual interaction starts near the base of the helical vortex sheets as there is a counter rotating hub vortex which is also stronger thicker than the tip vortex and is preceded by sheets stretching or inclination starting from tip vortex position 4 fig 18a the vorticity and velocity gradients induced between the tip and hub vortices lead to the larger pitch variation of the sheets and their bending this contributes to the bringing of adjacent sheets closer together and thereby enhancing the observed mutual interaction of the sheet vortices furthermore fig 18b shows that this mutual interaction is accompanied by short wave instabilities in the tip vortical filaments and at the same time these sheets begin to detach from their parent tip vortex tip vortex position 5 fig 18a ultimately starting interaction with the previously shed tip vortex at about x r 3 5 at tip vortex position 7 for this higher advance coefficient case j 0 85 as shown in fig 18a this detachment and subsequent reattachment completes at about tip vortex position 9 for this case once this occurs we can see that breakup in the tip vortical filament begins along with initiation of long wave instabilities as highlighted at tip vortex position 10 x r 5 in the fig 18b next at medium advance coefficient j 0 65 fig 19 the helical sheets mutual interaction hs mi moderates as the vortex sheets become detached from their parent tip vortex quickly consequently these helical sheets start interacting with the previously shed tip vortex at a much earlier stage x r 1 8 at tip vortex position 4 as highlighted in fig 19a the interaction and subsequent reattachment with the preceding tip vortex completes at tip vortex position 5 6 again once this transpires the breakup of the tip vortical filaments begins as highlighted at tip vortex position 7 x r 3 in fig 19b along with the appearance of long wave instabilities for the lowest advance coefficient j 0 45 fig 20 hs mi is not observable rather the helical vortex sheets interact only with the tip vortices however it is noted that the helical sheets seem to skip a tip vortex after detaching from the parent tip vortex and subsequently attaching with preceding tip vortex as shown in fig 20a once this interaction with the previously shed tip vortex occurs just after x r 1 the short wave instabilities start to appear as highlighted in fig 20b followed by long wave instabilities subsequently the wake breakup initiation begins after about x r 2 as depicted in fig 20b it is suggested that the helical vortex sheets are distorted by a velocity field induced by the tip and hub vortices at higher advance coefficient this induced velocity field is small so that the distortion of the sheets is gradual consequently sheets remain attached to their associated tip vortex for a long time and the interaction of adjacent sheet vortices is delayed as the advance coefficient decreases the induced velocity increases and the helical sheets are convected and distorted more rapidly accelerating the onset of hs mi this induces a faster separation of these sheets from their parent tip vortex for the lowest advance coefficient considered j 0 45 the induced velocity field is so strong that the helical sheets are stripped from their parent tip vortices immediately separated sheets then get convected and distorted downstream rapidly passing multiple tip vortices and inducing instability earlier than the other cases further and as discussed earlier the sheets are composed of two layers of opposing signs figs 18a 19a and 20a due to blade boundary layers on each side generating separate sheet layers di felice et al 2004 it is further seen that the layer with the same sign as the tip vortex and shed from the suction side appears to be attached to the tip vortex while further in board mid way in the radial direction it overlaps and attaches with the other opposing sheet coming from the pressure side and corresponds more with the root region however with decreasing advance coefficient fig 20a vs 18a the sheet from the pressure side opposing sign stays stronger near the tip vortex which is also therefore suggested to be a cause of greater instabilities at the lower advance coefficients the short and long wave instabilities as mentioned by widnall 1972 are observed as highlighted in fig 18 j 0 85 fig 19 j 0 65 and fig 20 j 0 45 as expected both short and long wave instabilities commence earlier with decreasing advance coefficient however at the lowest advance coefficient the long wave instabilities follow the short wave instabilities fairly quickly in general terms the long wave instabilities appear about two cycles after the shortwave instabilities at the higher advance coefficient j 0 85 about one cycle at medium advance coefficient j 0 65 and about half a cycle at the lowest advance coefficient j 0 45 these figures also indicate that at the same time when the sheet vortices start interacting and initiating the commencement of instabilities in the tip vortex the hub vortex also undergoes twisting and starts transitioning towards instability mutual interaction of the tip vortical filaments eventually plays the dominant role in the far wake breakup but that itself is initiated by the mutual interaction among adjacent helical vortex sheets as to be detailed in the proceeding section section 4 3 far wake analyses fig 21 shows the wake behaviour at the three advance coefficients as observed on transverse planes yz at different axial distances for the transition region the helical vortex sheets become detached from their tip vortex relatively quickly at medium advance coefficient leading to earlier commencement of wake instabilities and thus quicker wake breakdown as compared to higher advance coefficient further tip vortices at the lowest advance coefficient are much stronger compared to those at the medium advance coefficient whereas the tip vortices at the medium advance coefficient are moderately stronger as compared to those at the higher advance coefficient fig 21 also shows that at higher advance coefficient the helical sheet vortices have similar magnitude vorticity as is for their respective tip vortices as the advance coefficient decreases and associated blade loading increasing the strength of the helical sheet vortices relative to their corresponding tip vortices decreases 4 3 far wake analysis in the far wake the propeller wake breaks down completely as depicted in figs 22 25 below the mutual interaction among tip vortical filaments in the propeller far wake leads to leap frogging and this is captured in the numerical results these are similar to those observed in experiments felli et al 2011 in fig 23 using inter filament distances it is shown when and how mutual interaction among tip vortical filaments takes place of the four tip vortex filaments from the four blades two pairs are formed fig 23c shows distance between the two pairing filaments while fig 23d shows distance between all the four consecutive filaments as discussed in the preceding section wake breakup begins after the helical vortex sheets start interacting with the previously shed tip vortex fig 23c highlights that soon after the mutual interaction among the adjacent helical sheets x r 2 5 at j 0 85 and x r 1 8 at j 0 65 the distance among filaments starts to decrease and this inter filament distance starts to decrease rapidly after reattachment followed by interaction of helical sheets with the preceding tip vortex x r 5 5 at j 0 85 and x r 3 at j 0 65 once this distance approaches zero leap frogging occurs with the subsequent complete breakdown of the tip vortical filaments also a comparison is made with the lowest advance coefficient and as expected distance among pairing filaments decreases rapidly as compared to higher advance coefficients at the lowest advance coefficients the inter filament distance is already reduced and falls rapidly contributing to earlier breakdown as compared to higher advance coefficients additionally it is observed that a reduction in the distance between one filament pair results in an increase in the separation distance between this filament pair and the other pair of filaments represented in the fig 23b by troughs and crests respectively fig 24 shows the propeller wake vortical structures and mutual inductance among filaments before the breakup thorough half a cycle of propeller revolution at incremental instances of time at j 0 45 while fig 25 shows propeller wake vortical structures thorough a full cycle of propeller revolution at incremental instances of time at j 0 65 as highlighted in both figs 24 and 25 the filaments start mutual interaction and then there is the leap frogging mechanism and finally the breakdown among other details in figs 24 and 25 the mutual inductance and leap frogging effect can be observed in similar pattern as that observed in experimental work by felli et al 2011 in the transition region it was observed in preceding section that the hub vortex starts to twist when mutual interaction among helical sheets commences this twisting is representative of short wave instabilities in the hub vortex fig 25 shows that long wave instabilities start to appear in the hub vortex only after complete breakdown of the tip vortical filaments therefore in the far wake region the mutual interaction among tip vortical filaments completes the wake breakdown instigated in the transition region due to the helical vortex sheets mutual interaction 5 quantitative wake analyses 5 1 principal component analyses to have inclusive determination of propeller wake instabilities mathematical analyses of the propeller wake are carried out by quantifying short wave instabilities for this purpose the principal component analysis pca is performed on the cfd data the propeller wake is broken down into segments by cutting planes through the vortical structures at successive intervals 5 along the full circumference the segmenting results in two dimensional tip vortical cross sections at each plane along the spatial wake length one such plane is shown in fig 26 for each of the resulting tip vortices cross sections pca is performed which is further weighted by vorticity mathematically the weighted mean x i w and the covariance matrix c i are formulated as given by yu and turk 2010 based on work of koren and carmel 2003 16 x i w j w i j x j j w i j 17 c i j w i j x j x i w x j x i w j w i j where x j and w i j represent the mesh nodal points and corresponding vorticity values at these nodes inside a tip vortex cross section next the eigenvalues λ are computed based on the covariance matrix c i for each of the tip vortex cross section essentially pca obtained eigenvalues thus define anisotropy of vortices cross sections which we call vortex core circularity vcc higher vcc defined by higher normalized eigenvalue indicates that the tip vortex is circular in shape and stable while lower eigenvalues indicate increasing short wave instabilities and that the vortex has lost its original shape fig 26 eigenvalues of the cross sections are then traced for each of the four filaments along their respective lengths the mean λ is obtained by taking arithmetic average along all the four filament lengths fig 27 shows trendcurve moving average of mean vortex core circularity plotted at the lower medium and higher advance coefficients it can be seen from these charts fig 27 that at lower advance coefficient the eigenvalues start to decrease rapidly in near wake immediately after evolution while at higher advance coefficient the eigenvalues drop at slower rates and further downstream the decreasing eigenvalues vcc means increasing short wave instabilities because the wake breakdowns quickly at lower advance coefficients this indicates that vortex core circularity plays an important role in wake stability as the tip vortex is able to maintain its circular shape with increasing advance coefficients the wake breaks down further downstream at higher advance coefficients in the preceding sections a new mechanism hs mi is identified as instability initiator especially at higher advance coefficients it was further observed that this mutual interaction among adjacent sheets is accompanied by short wave instabilities in tip vortex filaments these visual qualitative findings are confirmed by the quantitative analyses as described here fig 27 corroborates that soon after the mutual interaction among the adjacent helical sheets x r 2 5 at j 0 85 and x r 1 8 at j 0 65 the vortex core circularity starts to decrease rapidly as indicated by the corresponding vertical dotted lines lastly in the far wake quantitative analyses section 4 3 it was shown that inter filament distance starts to decrease rapidly after reattachment of sheets with the preceding tip vortex x r 5 5 at j 0 85 and x r 3 at j 0 65 corresponding to these spatial locations we see that the vortex core circularity distorts to below the 0 6 λ value indicated by horizontal dashed line for all the advance coefficients 5 2 wake envelope analyses the instability mechanisms suggested in this article are also supported by the wake envelope instability analyses these instability analyses of the wake streamtube carried out here are similar to that performed by felli et al 2011 and also by kumar and mahesh 2017 felli et al 2011 extracted the wake streamtube curve from the standard deviation image calculated over 1000 time history visualizations of the wake vortical structures whereas kumar and mahesh 2017 traced the wake envelope from the azimuthal averaged axial velocity contour plots the wake envelope extracted in current work is obtained from the mean axial velocity profiles similar to kumar and mahesh 2017 one such averaged axial velocity contour plot with red region showing the area where axial flow velocity is lower than the free stream velocity is shown in the fig 28 below for clarity the wake vortical structures are also embedded in the same fig 28 from an instantaneous moment in time after that the axial locations of the tip vortex instability inception positions iips are determined similar to the method proposed by felli et al 2011 the criterion by felli et al 2011 for iip is defined as the first position at which the wake envelope of tip vortices diverges suddenly after the slipstream contraction where such a divergence equals 50 of the maximum slope of the envelope foremost we are interested in the first region of the wake envelope to undergo significant radial expansion with the corresponding x r value called iip fig 29 shows the wake envelope near this first radial expansion for j 0 85 using this procedure the iips for the two main advance coefficients considered j 0 85 and j 0 65 are computed and plotted against those obtained from the experiments fig 30 the comparison is satisfactory although for j 0 85 point the experimental data is extrapolated importantly the wake envelope analyses shows that the transition to instability begins at x r 1 5 fig 30 for the main advance coefficient j 0 85 being analyzed here recalling from the transition wake analyses in section 4 2 it is emphasized that not long after this instability inception position x r 1 5 helical vortex sheets start stretching or inclination tip vortex position 4 fig 18a followed by mutual interaction among the adjacent sheets fig 18a and short waves start appearing in the tip vortical filaments fig 18b also after this point the helical vortex sheets start becoming detached from their parent tip vortex fig 18a similar observations are made for the medium advance coefficient j 0 65 considered in the study though at a moderate level it is therefore concluded that with the helical sheets detachment after their stretching and mutual interaction tip vortices are pushed outwards thus beginning the transition to instability 6 instability mechanisms the helical vortex sheets and their role in instability mechanisms have been mentioned in earlier works notably di felice et al 2004 observed the helical vortex sheets detachment from respective tip vortex which are subsequently rolled up by the preceding tip vortex this helical sheets and the preceding tip vortex interaction hs ptv i was observed for a medium advance coefficient j 0 75 and along the longitudinal plane mainly while the hub vortex was not shown the lower advance coefficients were not considered di felice et al 2004 and this phenomenon could not be observed at higher advance coefficients j 0 88 and j 1 01 considered in the study due to limited measurement windows length di felice et al 2004 later felli et al 2006 using pressure measurements evaluation of energy transfer from blade to shaft harmonics and observing the precession of the streamtube around the hub vortex confirmed that the transition to instability starts when the helical sheets begin interacting with the preceding tip vortex okulov and sørensen 2007 concluded that far wake models based on joukowski s model joukowski 1912 are unconditionally unstable due to the consideration of constant circulation over the blade span spanwise blade circulation however is not constant and the wake stabilized when helical vortex sheets resulting from the spanwise varying circulation are incorporated into the model okulov and sørensen 2007 okulov and sørensen 2007 also opined that the complete roll up of the sheets leads to standalone tip vortices and eventual wake instability felli et al 2011 however emphasized that the mutual interaction among tip vortical filaments tv mi plays the major role in ship propeller wake instabilities rather than the complete roll up of sheets they based this conclusion on same intensity tip vortex filaments breaking further and further downstream upon increasing the number of blades though advance coefficient had to be increased too the reason being as the roll up of the sheets is dictated by the strength of the tip vortex attached to their end the same intensity filament should break at similar distances interestingly citing their prior works di felice et al 2004 felli et al 2006 felli et al 2011 ended the discussion by arguing that when the sheets interact with the previously shed tip vortex the parent tip vortex ultimately becomes detached from its sheet and thus in effect becomes isolated and that this deserves a future study the present work is a step forward in this suggested direction the interaction of helical sheet vortices with the tip vortex is suggested as a possible cause for wake instability by kumar and mahesh 2017 however in a different way their les work analyzed a weakly loaded tip propeller shedding weaker tip vortices as compared to the insean e779a propeller studied in this work and other works mentioned here di felice et al 2004 felli et al 2011 2006 the propeller analyzed by kumar and mahesh 2017 has more blades five and only a single higher advance coefficient j 0 889 was considered in their study for such a case kumar and mahesh 2017 they argued that the mutual inductance among tip vortices is not strong enough with the result that the helical sheets take time and undergo complete roll up not only in the transverse but also somewhat in the longitudinal plane the sheets however detach quickly not only from the tip vortices but also break into smaller concentrated vortices leaving behind standalone but stable tip vortices in the near wake ultimately they argued that this leads to mutual inductance between rolled up and isolated sheet vortices and the preceding tip vortices causing wake instability while also claiming it to be different than the hs ptv i observed by di felice et al 2004 posa et al 2019 contended that some phenomena similar to sheet fragmentation as seen by kumar and mahesh 2017 might be there but that the main sources of isolated vortices in the sheet region are the additional structures shed from the blade suction side for their case of highly loaded seven bladed marine propeller operating at lower advance coefficients further the hub vortex and the additional helical vortices coming from the near root region survive for much larger distances as compared to the tip vortices especially at the lower advance coefficients while the tip vortices just vanish without any filament interactions in the mid wake region similar to kumar and mahesh 2017 and at equivalent locations for all advance coefficients that posa et al 2019 considered lastly in posa et al 2019 visualizations it is seen that the helical sheets roll up and bend much more in the longitudinal plane beginning a very early hs ptv i which they also associated with wake instabilities however in both these latest works kumar and mahesh 2017 posa et al 2019 the tip vortical filament interactions and subsequent leap frogging could not be observed due to their propeller geometry and operating conditions here we have linked these phenomena with in depth visualizations and quantifications while addressing gaps in the current literature based on the observations from this work detailed visually in section 4 2 and quantitatively in sections 4 3 5 1 and 5 2 hs mi is likely to be an instabilities initiating mechanism leading to propeller wake breakup particularly at higher advance coefficients this effect reduces as the advance coefficient decreases and at the lowest advance coefficient considered here there is an apparent skipping of tip vortex by helical sheets while detaching and reattaching of the latter however it is suggested that the mechanisms observed for the higher advance coefficients may still occur but much more rapidly and hence are harder to detect nevertheless at higher advance coefficients hs mi is shown as an important mechanism contributing to the onset of propeller wake instabilities at higher advance coefficients the wake length is long enough to study the wake behaviour appropriately and therefore the wake instability initiation as proposed here is significant next the analyses of the transition wake presented here support the di felice at al 2004 and felli et al 2006 hs ptv i observations in the preceding sections it is detailed that the break down of tip vortical filaments starts soon after the helical vortex sheets complete the interaction fully reattach rolled by with the preceding tip vortex further it is shown that when this helical sheet tip vortex reattachment occurs hs ptv i long wave instabilities grow and the mutual filament distance starts decreasing rapidly tv mi leading to leap frogging of tip vortices with the reattached and already rolled up sheets and eventual wake breakdown as for the concentrated tip vortices felli et al 2011 we observe that these start to appear at tip vortex position 6 fig 18a and at x r 2 34 fig 21 for the higher advance coefficient however the wake does not destabilize immediately though instabilities continue this leads us to two possibilities either the detached sheets stabilize the wake by supporting the subsequent tip vortices during the detachment reattachment phase re stabilized vcc is noticed at corresponding x r 3 5 5 region fig 27 until the sheets become fully reattached at tip vortex position 9 fig 18a alternatively the sheets remain linked fig 18a and the tip vortices are not as concentrated as they seem in these two possibilities the earlier discussion in this paragraph holds fully true i e the tv mi felli et al 2011 conclusively culminates the transition instabilities that begin with hs mi current work and are amplified by the hs ptv i di felice et al 2004 the phase averaged turbulent kinetic energy tke observations confirm these findings with a sample field shown in fig 31 below for completeness it can be seen that initially the sheet region undergoes instability followed by the tip vortices region with highest levels of tke seen in the tv mi region hub vortex remains stable however higher levels of tke seen in the near wake correspond to initial separation effects at hub some form of the sheets fragmentation phenomena as mentioned by kumar and mahesh 2017 is also observed for the more heavily loaded tip propeller though at lightly loaded conditions j 0 85 figs 18a and 21 studied in the present work for the first time fig 18a clearly shows helical vortex sheets fragmenting into smaller vortical structures around tip vortex positions 2 and 3 followed by attraction of sheet vortices at tip vortex position 4 towards tip vortex position 5 and subsequently of those at 5 towards tip vortex positioned at 6 this attraction continues with ultimate detachment of helical vortex sheets occurring at tip vortex position 7 these detached sheet vortices start interacting with the preceding tip vortex 8 while the sheet vortices of tip vortex 8 become fully reattached at tip vortex position 9 however it is emphasized that apart from fragmentation the hs tv i in the axial plane is more like the experimental visualizations of di felice et al 2004 and less like those in kumar and mahesh 2017 and posa et al 2019 some similar observations to posa et al 2019 regarding additional vortical structures can also be seen for instance in fig 18b the additional structures in between the tip and hub vortical filaments can be clearly seen with those near the root region with larger pitch surviving longer up to about x r 4 as compared to those near the intermediate or tip region still these additional structures are nowhere a match to tip or hub vortices which survive relatively much longer at all loading conditions for the ship propeller analyzed here although at some locations these additional structures seem to overlap the sheet regions which can be seen in fig 18c where the vortical structures are super imposed on the vorticity plane it is contended that the general source seems to be the sheets and their fragmentation in the current case instead this may be due to difference in propeller geometries and operating conditions as for the transverse planes fig 21 shows the roll up of helical vortex sheets at tip vortex positions 4 and 5 for j 0 85 similar to that observed by di felice et al 2004 felli et al 2008 and kumar and mahesh 2017 figs 17 and 21 also show that the roll up phenomenon is reduced for the medium advance coefficient of j 0 65 further fig 17 shows that the sheets start interacting with the preceding tip vortex without any apparent roll up for the lowest advance coefficient j 0 45 considered here the decreased roll up with decreasing advance coefficient is compensated by increased mutual interaction among tip vortical filaments as observed in the visualizations section 4 2 and as quantified by the filament gap analyses section 4 3 this again confirms the earlier finding of di felice et al 2004 and felli et al 2006 and corroborates the latter findings of felli et al 2011 and magionesi et al 2018 that is the tv mi is more dominant at lower advance coefficients due to less inter filament distance and thicker tip vortices in summary the hs mi is proposed as a mechanism contributing to instigate the ship propeller wake instabilities this transition to instability is closely followed by short wave instabilities in the tip vortical filaments and sheet detachment initiations at lightly loaded condition j 0 85 specifically we also observe the fragmentation of helical sheets into smaller sheet vortices and their definite roll up in the transverse plane but somewhat less roll up and more inclination bending and subsequent attraction and interaction with the preceding tip vortices like that of di felice et al 2004 and felli et al 2008 later the hs ptv i accelerates the variation of inter filament distance thus initiating the tv mi ultimately it is the actual tv mi interaction that produces long wave instabilities eventually leading to leap frogging of the tip vortical filaments in two pairs for the four bladed propeller considered this is followed by complete wake breakdown first in the tip vortical filaments and then by waves in the hub vortex and eventually its breakdown also relevant instability mechanisms as observed in various prior studies are thus shown to be correlated in current work with their reliance on operating conditions also highlighted 7 conclusions an analysis of propeller wake flow field has been completed by employing large eddy simulations for different loading conditions j 0 45 j 0 65 and j 0 85 numerical verification and validation has been completed the later by comparing the propeller open water and wake flow characteristics with available experimental data for the selected benchmark ship propeller insean e779a at various advance coefficients from low j 0 45 to medium j 0 65 to high j 0 85 the propeller wake geometry and hydrodynamic characteristics have been described from evolution to breakdown through these descriptions it is inferred that wmles is effective for the evaluation of propeller wake flow structures especially at higher reynolds numbers wmles can provide valuable information on both propeller wake geometry and also on the wake breakdown mechanisms this is useful at industry design stage as wmles uses fairly lower density grid able to be solved with practical computational resources additionally gaps in our understanding of the fundamental physics related to mechanisms leading to propeller wake instabilities have been investigated instabilities are initiated in the transition region and a new instability mechanism has been identified specifically the hs mi which occurs in the transition region is shown to be a possible cause of propeller wake instability particularly at higher advance coefficients j 0 85 at medium advance coefficient j 0 65 this mutual interaction among adjacent helical vortex sheets reduces in intensity however it still seems to play a role in initiating instability mechanisms at lowest advance coefficient j 0 45 the instability initiation is related to the skipping of tip vortex by the helical vortex sheets after this skipping process the interaction of helical vortex sheets and previously shed tip vortices precedes the occurrence of tip vortical filament breakdown it is suggested that velocity field between tip and hub vortices distorts helical sheets and that the weakening velocity field with increasing advance coefficient fig a1 vs fig a2 results in a more stable wake at higher advance coefficients the helical vortex sheets effects seem to reduce as advance coefficient decreases however it is suggested that their interactions still occur but much more rapidly due to increasingly stronger velocity fields fig a2 vs fig a1 and hence are difficult to notice in any case at higher advance coefficients the wake length is long enough to study all the wake mechanisms and therefore the instability mechanisms and their inter relations as proposed here are significant furthermore it is shown how the distance between adjacent tip vortical filaments decreases soon after hs mi and this decrease escalates once hs ptv i ensues this decreasing distance eventually leads to tv mi followed by leap frogging and complete breakdown in the far wake essentially thus hs mi is shown as a new and possibly important breakup triggering mechanism especially at higher advance coefficients further the various instability mechanisms are shown to be correlated it is proposed that the tv mi felli et al 2011 conclusively culminates the transition instabilities that begin possibly with hs mi current work and are amplified by the hs ptv i

coefficients are predicted with good precision and accuracy even by the coarsest mesh employing whether unsteady rans or steady rans or les therefore for a further and appropriate numerical verification of les the flow features are also compared for instance and shown here for various grid refinement levels phase averaged axial velocity values are compared on a line in the near wake at x r 0 2 and extending from the propeller hub cap through to the center of tip vortex the results shown in the figs a 1 and a 2 are at the highest advance coefficient of j 0 88 and the lowest coefficient of j 0 45 respectively as can be seen from the axial velocity comparison the 12 million mesh slightly under predicts velocity peaks and valleys in the tip vortex region with the 18 million mesh results converging towards the results obtained with the 24 million mesh schroeder 2014 carried out numerical verification for les of marine propellers by comparing the tip vortex resolution between two grid sizes in the near wake and on a plane in a similar manner fig a3 shows the tip vortex and sheets resolution at about x r 1 15 for all the three mesh resolutions considered along with mesh employed there are about 250 cells in the tip vortex region of the finest mesh 24 million in this plane and this exact mesh is simply extruded up to 12 propeller radii downstream with the height of resulting prisms fixed at a similar size there will be more cells at further lower coefficients as the tip vortex becomes correspondingly thicker the vortices resolution is also shown in the longitudinal plane in fig a 4 in both planes it can be seen that while there is numerical dissipation of vortices by the coarsest mesh the vortex resolution at medium mesh starts approaching the finest mesh free of numerical dissipation considered here lastly the whole wake is compared up to the far wake region fig a 4 with the coarsest mesh clearly unable to resolve the vortical structures while the finest mesh able to resolve the best corresponding to experiments similar results not shown are observed for the lowest advance coefficient j 0 45 it is clear that for the assessments being

21627,this paper evaluates the propeller wake characteristics of the benchmark ship propeller insean e779a using large eddy simulations and identifies instability mechanisms that lead to wake breakdown the effects of propeller blade loading on wake stability are considered by conducting simulations at different advance coefficients j 0 85 j 0 65 and j 0 45 the hydrodynamic results capture the propeller wake vortical structures and flow features from the onset and evolution of the instability to the far wake the simulation results are verified and validated against experimental measurements from the literature a new instability mechanism concerning mutual interaction among adjacent helical vortex sheets in the transition region is identified further the formation of short wave instabilities in the vortex filaments is found to be initiated by the same mutual interactions among sheets lastly it is shown that interaction of sheets with the preceding tip vortex induces the onset of tip vortical filaments breakup mutual interaction and long wave instability keywords cfd les ship propeller wake tip vortex hub vortex helical vortex sheets 1 introduction of all components on maritime vessels the propeller is one of the most important propeller hydrodynamics affects ship power characteristics noise generation as well as many aspects of ship operability with experimental testing often cost prohibitive the ability to perform expedient numerical simulations for understanding propeller hydrodynamics is essential for maritime vessel design and operation a propeller creates thrust by generating lift from its blades hydrofoil cross sections as they rotate water is accelerated aft of the propeller because of the pressure difference between suction and pressure sides of the blade propelling the vessel forward unlike fans and aircraft propellers a ship propeller operates at low rotational speeds using blades with larger chords and more complex geometry these blade shapes are necessary to provide high thrust and to prevent cavitation these and other factors such as wake instabilities lead to complex flow phenomenon the propeller wake is composed of vortical structures shed from the blade trailing edges that roll up because of pressure difference across the front and back surfaces of the blade as a result two vortical filaments are formed one at the tip and the other at root sections of the blade these are called the tip and the hub vortices respectively in addition there is a sheet of vorticity shed from the entire trailing edge due to varying circulation over the blade radius and the boundary layer which we will call the helical vortex sheets the propeller wake has three regions containing distinct flow phenomenon felli 2007 a near wake region about one propeller radius where the wake evolves rolls up and undergoes a slipstream contraction next is the transition region where the wake vortical structures slowly destabilize the final region is known as the far wake region where the wake breaks down completely the mechanisms leading to evolution contraction and breakdown of these vortical structures shed from a ship propeller are not completely understood and are a major focus of this paper joukowski 1912 proposed a pioneering propeller wake theoretical model by considering constant circulation along a lifting line resulting in the wake consisting of finite core helical tip vortices from each blade and a single rectilinear hub vortex of opposing strength widnall 1972 investigated the stability of a single helical vortex filament with respect to spatial perturbations she used inviscid linear stability analysis to show that an isolated helical vortex filament has three modes of instabilities short wave long wave and mutual inductance for short wave instabilities perturbations are inside the vortex cores with wavelengths on the order of the core radius for long wave instabilities the perturbations displace the whole vortex filament with wavelengths much larger than the core radius and mutual inductance occurs when neighboring filaments interact with decreasing helix pitch gupta and loewy 1974 bhagwat and leishman 2000 okulov 2004 and okulov and sørensen 2007 extended the theoretical analysis to systems of filaments with the later study including the helical vortex sheets and the hub vortex importantly okulov and sørensen 2007 concluded that joukowski s model joukowski 1912 is unconditionally unstable and that helical vortex sheets must be incorporated to formulate a stable wake as observed in experiments this theoretical research is related to general rotor wake instabilities and is summarized in a recent review by leweke et al 2016 the instability modes as mentioned and predicted by theoretical approaches have been observed generally in numerical and experimental studies for rotors stella et al 2000 felli et al 2011 nemes et al 2015 muscari et al 2013 magionesi et al 2018 however felli et al 2011 experimentally observed some inconsistencies of the latest theoretical models okulov and sørensen 2010 2007 for predicting stability boundaries of ship propeller wakes for instance the velocity fields derived by the theoretical vorticity distributions did not match with experimental data felli et al 2011 also the theoretical models suggest that the wake behind a rotor should breakdown at the same distance if the tip vortex intensity remains the same however when felli et al 2011 decreased the number of blades the wake break down occurred further downstream with this effect observed at low to high advance coefficients experimentally many ship propeller wake instabilities have been investigated in studies carried out using the benchmark propeller insean e779a felli et al 2011 2007 2006 di felice et al 2004 stella et al 2000 earlier works focused on general wake characteristics loukakis 1971 kerwin 1976 min 1978 kobayashi 1982 jessup 1989 issues such as the effects of loading number of propeller blades vortex filament mutual interaction the interaction of the blade with the ship s wake and the effect of spiralling along the hub vortex leading to tip vortex destabilization have been raised and studied to varying extents in recent works di felice et al 2009 2004 felli et al 2011 2008 2007 2006 regarding instability instigating mechanisms di felice et al 2004 observed the interaction of helical vortex sheets with the preceding tip vortex later felli et al 2006 using pressure velocity correlations inferred that this interaction caused the onset of instabilities due to experimental challenges most earlier works were limited to the near wake and velocity measurements along transversal planes while later di felice et al 2004 and felli et al 2006 also analyzed along longitudinal planes though still limited till the transition region in 2011 felli et al 2011 carried out landmark three dimensional wake experiments and concluded that the mutual inductance mode which occurs among adjacent helical tip vortical filaments forms the basis of marine propeller wake instabilities detached eddy simulation des was later used to simulate the wake of the same propeller e779a muscari et al 2013 di mascio et al 2014 guilmineau et al 2015 in these studies muscari et al 2013 and guilmineau et al 2015 while comparing des against reynolds averaged navier stokes rans concluded that although rans methods predict thrust and torque coefficients satisfactorily higher fidelity approaches such as des and les are required to capture the wake vortical structures di mascio et al 2014 analyzed wake dynamics using des in an oblique flow and concluded that for such conditions secondary vortical structures with the tip vortices leading to earlier wake breakdown as compared to uniform inflow conditions bensow and liefvendahl 2008 studied the effect of implicit and explicit subgrid modelling in les to evaluate the flow around e779a propeller while recognizing the need for additional simulations with refined meshes for a comprehensive evaluation recently large eddy simulation les has been employed to simulate a marine propeller wake specifically to study its geometric characteristics kumar and mahesh 2017 kumar and mahesh 2017 stated that the attraction and interaction between tip vortex and adjacent helical sheet vortices plays an important role in the development of wake instabilities however the actual instability mechanism depends on propeller and flow characteristics in this regard the propeller used in their work kumar and mahesh 2017 shed weak tip vortices and the far field breakup of tip vortical filaments could not be visualized magionesi et al 2018 extended an earlier work where the flow field was obtained using des muscari et al 2013 to modal analyses for the benchmark insean e779a propeller it was found that at a lower advance coefficient j 0 38 the most significant energetic modes associated with the wake destabilization mechanisms describe the pairing of the tip vortices and the subsequent distortion of tip vortical filaments however for relatively higher advance coefficient j 0 71 no significant instability could be identified due to the propeller wake remaining stable over the length of the computational domain considered posa et al 2019 contended that the source of the smaller vortices seen in the sheet region by kumar and mahesh 2017 is different for their case of a highly loaded seven bladed propeller this literature review thus shows that a consensus regarding the mechanisms leading to ship propeller wake instabilities is yet to be reached although being researched theoretically experimentally and computationally a full understanding of the propeller wake behavior remains elusive specifically when and how instabilities start to commence how helical vortex sheets interact with tip vortices the interaction of tip vortical filaments before final breakdown and the influence of the hub vortex are still open questions in this paper hydrodynamic analyses are performed using large eddy simulation les to gain a better understanding of propeller wake flow physics in the first part of the paper les is used to provide a description of the propeller wake geometry and related hydrodynamics in the second part mechanisms leading to wake breakdown are studied and identified the simulations consist of numerical tests similar to that performed in experimental facilities for the evaluation of propeller wake characteristics validation of the hydrodynamic simulations is completed by comparison with experimental data available for propeller e779a di felice et al 2004 felli et al 2011 2007 salvatore et al 2006 the assessment of results along with the les capturing of flow field vortex formation and wake instabilities are discussed 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations the turbulent flow over propellers and the subsequent wake breakdown mechanisms are difficult to estimate using ideal flow theory or other theoretical approximations to account for all propeller hydrodynamics three dimensional unsteady incompressible and viscous turbulent flow must be considered for such flows the incompressible continuity and navier stokes equations are given by 1 x i ρ u i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u l x l in equations 1 and 2 above u i and u j are the instantaneous components of velocity p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density μ is the dynamic viscosity and δ i j is the kronecker delta in les a spatial filtering function separates the turbulent flow into larger eddies which are resolved and smaller eddies that are modelled using an appropriate sub grid scale sgs model the filtering function thus depends on the mesh size in particular regions of the computational domain for any flow characteristics variable φ such as pressure velocity etc the filtering operation leads to a filtered field defined by variable φ and a sub grid scale field defined by φ as follows 3 φ φ φ this work utilizes ansys fluent 2016 to solve the les equations here the finite volume method provides the filter function and the corresponding filtered variable φ is calculated from volume v of the mesh cell as 4 φ x 1 v v φ x d x x v to resolve the relevant turbulent eddies the filtered continuity and navier stokes equations used for les are 5 x i ρ u i 0 6 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u l x l x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j the essential flow statistics contained in the larger eddies are thus resolved and the les convergence towards the exact solution can be increased by refining the mesh size depending on available resources in general the effects of the sub grid residual structures are not completely discarded and appear as an additional term in the filtered navier stokes equation 6 these sgs stresses τ i j are modelled using the boussinesq hypothesis 7 τ i j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 1 3 δ i j τ k k the residual stresses represented by τ k k being isotropic in nature do not require modelling and are added to filtered static pressure term the only parameter requiring modelling in equation 7 above is turbulent viscosity μ t the general mesh resolution guidelines for wall resolved les are δx 100 wall y 1 and δz 30 davidson 2009 this however increases the mesh size considerably for wall bounded flows in general and for propeller wake in particular if an isotropic mesh is desired for the length of the propeller wake to counter issues such as this shur et al 2008 proposed a hybrid model which couples a modified smagorinsky model c s m a g δ 2 with the prandtl van driest mixing length k d w 2 model and the associated wall damping function modified by piomelli et al 1988 in this approach the turbulent viscosity μ t is given as 8 μ t ρ v t min k d w 2 c s m a g δ 2 s 1 exp y 25 3 in the equation 8 the distance from the wall is represented by d w the subgrid length scale by δ and the strain rate by s while k 0 41 and c smag 0 2 are constants importantly δ which is usually taken as cubic root of the cell volume in general les is also improved to account for the grid anisotropies in the inner part of the logarithmic wall region this modified subgrid length scale is defined as 9 δ min max c w d w c w h m a x h w n h m a x in the equation 9 above h wn is the grid spacing in the wall normal direction h max is the maximum edge length for a mesh cell and c w 0 15 is an empirical constant evaluated from wall resolved les wrles as the grid normal to walls is usually finer than the other two directions in any wall bounded les the use of this modified subgrid length scale is advantageous not only for the wall modelled les wmles but can also be useful in general les with anisotropic grids and not involving an explicit filtering shur et al 2008 lastly blended functions enhanced with empirical data please see shur et al 2008 for details activate reynolds averaging but this sgs modelling is only in the inner part of the logarithmic layer while the outer part of the boundary layer is still resolved as the grid is refined near the wall more and more boundary layer turbulence is resolved such that for the limiting case of wrles mesh resolution only a very thin portion of the boundary layer is modelled the approach also resolves the problem of log layer mismatch which is common in other wmles methods still the wmles model cannot solve the transitional effects as the model does not provide zero eddy viscosity for flows with constant shear in the les portion therefore it is enhanced by addition of vorticity magnitude ω in the original formulation and named wmles s omega ansys 2016 this formulation is as given below 10 μ t ρ v t min k d w 2 c s m a g δ 2 a b s s ω 1 exp y 25 3 it is mentioned that typically a major part of the boundary layer on propeller blades may be laminar or transitional at the model scale dimensions especially if the low behind hull conditions mostly or critical reynolds number re regimes are applied in such a case sgs models such as wale nicoud and ducros 1999 considering both strain and vorticity appear to be the better choice ansys 2016 posa et al 2019 as compared to the dynamic smagorinsky lilly model germano et al 1991 lilly 1992 or the improved wmles s ω formulation as applied here however in the present case the re is considerably high re d nd 2 v 1 3 106 here and as per the ittc 2002 between re d 1 106 and 1 107 depending on propeller and j a fully developed turbulent boundary layer is established on both sides of the propeller blades notably felli et al 2011 showed the effect of re becomes negligible for this propeller e779a above a critical value with no difference between 25 rps as considered here and 30 rps while the difference between 25rps and 12rps was attributed to presence of laminar region at the lower rotational speed rijpkema et al 2015 also showed that for this same propeller as in the current work the flow at most of the blade region is turbulent for the high r e 0 7 r range as considered here especially at the higher j 0 7 case that they considered we are mainly focused here at a higher value j 0 85 j design and thus the flow at the blades can be considered mostly turbulent lastly it is also an objective of the current work to use the lowest mesh density possible aligned with the objective of ship industry use les as further acoustic computations are based on the same mesh therefore and to keep the total number of cells to a manageable number an optimized form of wmles based on the shur et al 2008 approach which is further enhanced with s ω formulation is employed in the current work for the sub grid scale modelling 2 2 test case the propeller selected for the analysis insean e779a was developed initially for a commercial ferry e779a has later evolved as a benchmark propeller with sufficient experimental data available in literature di felice et al 2004 felli et al 2011 2007 2006 salvatore et al 2006 stella et al 2000 the other reason for selecting this propeller is that being highly loaded at the tip it sheds strong tip vortices hence it is particularly suitable for the study of the wake instability and breakdown phenomena where the dynamics of the tip vortices play an important role e779a is a model scale four blade wageningen modified type right handed propeller with slight skew and fixed pitch and has the design advance coefficient j design of 0 83 the geometry and profiles of the propeller blades are as shown in fig 1 the primary dimensions of the insean e779a propeller and flow characteristics are as given in table 1 2 3 numerical setup the computational domain consists of a cylindrical region with diameter three times and length twelve times the propeller diameter respectively the computational domain is kept similar in size as in experiments for effective validation and is large enough so as to avoid blockage effects stella et al 2000 the boundary conditions are based on an incoming uniform flow into a revolving propeller at fixed rotational speed of 25 revolutions per second the complete computational domain including boundary conditions is shown in fig 2 below a hybrid mesh consisting of pyramids prism layers tetrahedral and hexahedral cells is used a fine triangular surface mesh is used on the propeller blades and surrounding regions to resolve the curvature of the blades in the streamwise and the spanwise directions prism layers are extruded from this surface mesh to create a very fine boundary layer mesh in the near wall region the cylindrical volume around the propeller is then meshed with tetrahedral cells the propeller blades prism layers and tetrahedral mesh are designated as a rotating mesh further an inner cylinder of fine isotropic cells extends approximately six propeller diameters further downstream to ensure that the coherent vortical structures are adequately resolved most of the cells are thus clustered in the region surrounding the propeller and its wake for better convergence effort is also made to create a mesh without skewed elements a section of the generated mesh is shown in fig 3 numerical verification based on the grid independence studies is performed to decide the appropriate size of the hybrid mesh the grid independence studies are performed at the highest and lowest loading conditions considered in the current analyses with the results presented in appendix a out of the three mesh sizes the finest mesh comprising approximately 24 million cells is selected this mesh has a streamwise resolution δx 250 wall normal resolution δy 1 and spanwise resolution of δz 250 on the propeller blades unsteady rans urans simulations are carried out initially with the shear stress transport sst k ω model used to model the turbulence for solution discretization initially first order schemes are employed and after a stable solution is obtained second order upwind schemes are used the time discretization is also second order the flow fields from the converged urans simulations after about 15 propeller revolutions are then used to initialize the les analyses for les second order accurate central differencing discretization is used to discretize momentum and pressure while second order implicit is used for temporal discretization time step sizes used for les simulations are 1 1 38 10 5 s to keep the courant number generally under 0 3 the les solution becomes statistically steady judged by full development of wake vortical structures after about 10 propeller revolutions the averaging was carried out for a further 15 revolutions to simulate rigid body motion of the rotating propeller sliding meshes are employed all the cells in the fluid zone surrounding the propeller identified in fig 2 rotate relative to the adjacent stationary zones the zones are linked through non conformal mesh interfaces and the specified zone rotates as a whole as per the prescribed motion thus the cells within the rotating zone retain their geometry because of this rigid rotation and the mesh is not distorted at each time step the flow variables are interpolated across the non conformal interfaces the rotational speed of propeller is kept constant while different loading conditions are obtained by changing the incoming flow velocity the advance coefficient j used to define the loading condition is given as 11 j u n d in the equation above u is the free stream fluid velocity n is the propeller rotational speed and d is the diameter of the propeller it is important to note that at lower advance coefficient the propeller is under heavy loading condition compared to a higher advance coefficient convergence of the solution is evaluated by observing the residuals of solution variables with residual convergence criterion set at 1 10 6 and by monitoring the forces and moments acting on the propeller the simulations are performed on a cluster of computers composed of 168 cores and 128 gb of ram in general using these resources it takes about one day of wall time to simulate a single complete revolution using wmles s ω formulation on the finest mesh of 24 million cells considered here 3 numerical validation this section describes quantitative and qualitative analyses of results along with numerical validation by comparison against experimental measurements from the literature the propeller wake simulations are performed at a total of five different loading conditions the details of which are given in the table below from the highest to lowest advance coefficient considered in the analyses the validation is performed by comparison against experimental performance and flow characteristics as available in literature three main advance coefficients j 0 85 0 65 and 0 45 are considered for instability mechanisms identifications in the present work at these advance coefficients experimental open water characteristics and flow visualizations are available in the literature for the e779a propeller and compared below however the wake flow field quantities such as vorticity and velocities in the tip vortex and blade wake region are readily available at two other advance coefficients j 0 75 and j 0 88 therefore simulations are also performed at advance coefficients j 0 75 and j 0 88 to enable comparison against experimental flow variables for a comprehensive validation as detailed in the proceeding section 3 1 propeller open water characteristics the propeller open water characteristics such as thrust kt and torque coefficients kq are calculated from axial forces t and rotational moments about axial axes q acting on the propeller blades these performance characteristics are defined by the following equations 12 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 13 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 fig 4 shows the propeller thrust and torque coefficients against various advance coefficients predicted with the current les analyses fig 4 also shows experimental thrust and torque coefficients for propeller e779a as measured by salvatore et al 2006 the smaller torque coefficient is multiplied by ten times for both approaches it can be seen that the les results are in good agreement with the experimental results 3 2 propeller flow field characteristics the e779a propeller wake consists of four helical tip vortical filaments four axial root vortex filaments combining into a thick hub vortex filament and four layers of helical vortex sheets the vortical filaments are visualized using the q criterion while helical vortex sheets are visualized through the vorticity contour plots the q criterion proposed by hunt et al 1988 is a galilean invariant vortex criterion which defines the vortex as a spatial region where vorticity magnitude ω is greater than the strain rate magnitude s this eulerian criterion also necessitates that the local pressure inside the vortex core is smaller than the surrounding pressure it is defined as 14 q 0 5 ω 2 s 2 0 15 where s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i and ω i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i fig 5 depicts propeller wake vortical structures obtained from the les using the iso surfaces of the q criterion and compared against vortical structures obtained from experiments performed by felli et al 2011 these figures show that les describes the propeller wake far better from its evolution to instability to final breakdown while rans could only capture a limited behaviour importantly at all the three different advance coefficients considered les captured wake vortical structures are remarkably similar to the experimentally observed ones some slight differences in individual filaments are due to the instantaneous visualizations but these are acceptable as will become clear in subsequent section 4 3 where complete filament cycles figs 23 and 24 are shown nevertheless and as observed in experiments the pitch of the tip vortex increases with the advance coefficient and the propeller wake destabilizes and breaks down further downstream mainly it is observed that at the lowest advance coefficient j 0 45 the tip vortical filaments collapse completely and soon after the onset of the instabilities this is followed by waves in the hub vortex and its breakup whereas at the medium advance coefficient j 0 65 tip vortical filaments break further downstream and experience mutual interactions with adjacent filaments for few revolutions before proceeding to complete collapse this is followed by twisting and the appearance of waves in the hub vortex and its breakup further downstream not shown at the highest advance coefficient j 0 85 the tip vortical filaments remain intact for a long way downstream and then even after breakup initiation continue to interact with adjacent filaments for a significant distance downstream before ultimately collapsing the hub vortex at j 0 85 experiences mainly filament twisting with waves only starting to appear towards the outlet of the computational domain fig 6 shows wave like disturbances travelling along the tip vortical filaments similar to those observed in experiments conducted by felli 2007 two types of waves appear in the tip vortical filaments with both increasing in amplitude with downstream distance at first smaller waves appear with wavelengths comparable to the size of the filament diameter and are associated with short wave instabilities widnall 1972 then bigger waves appear that displace the filaments as a whole and are associated with long wave instabilities widnall 1972 the les vorticity contours on the central longitudinal plane shown in fig 7 a also compare well with the experimental measurements obtained by felli 2007 reproduced here in fig 7b due to the boundary layer on the propeller blades the helical vortex sheets are composed of two layers each of opposing signs important insights into the mechanisms leading to the initiation of marine propellers wake instabilities will be inferred from analyses of the vorticity plots at different advance coefficients in the proceeding section quantitative evaluation of the flow field is made by a comparison of simulated mean tip vortex position mean tip vortex vorticity and velocities in the wake region with experimental measurements of the same quantities obtained by di felice et al 2004 fig 8 shows that the mean vorticity of the tip vortices predicted with the current simulations is in good agreement with the experimental measurements the vorticity in the tip vortex fig 8 decreases along the wake length and follows a linear trend fig 9 shows that the radial positions of the tip vortices downstream of the propeller also agree well with the experimental trend overall the radial position of the tip vortex fig 9 decreases along the wake length exponentially before flattening off at a stable value however further downstream the radial position of the tip vortices begin to oscillate as instabilities arise fig 9 suggests that the instability inception point predicted in the current work is different from that measured in the experiments of di felice et al 2004 however this apparent difference is attributed to instantaneous observations and angular positions of blades which may be different between the two approaches although the four tip vortical filaments breakup in near vicinity of each other each filament follows a slightly different path and length some break bit early some bit later and therefore different radial position at any instant in time the phase averaged results of the complete wake envelope are a more robust approach to identify the instability inception point and as will be seen later fig 27 these results show excellent agreement between current les and experimental instability inception point felli et al 2011 fig 10 shows the comparison of the phase averaged mean axial velocity at 0 2 x r downstream of the propeller disk on a line from the hub and through the tip vortex in the tip vortex region there is excellent agreement between the phase averaged mean axial velocity predicted with the present simulations and the experimental measurements in the helical sheet region the mean velocity predicted by the les is slightly higher about 6 than the measured values in the experiment nevertheless in both approaches it is seen that after staying almost uniform in the helical sheet region the axial velocity increases as it approaches the tip vortex region the velocity then decreases sharply within the tip vortex region before starting recovery after passing through the tip vortex overall a good degree of qualitative and quantitative agreement between the numerically predicted results and the experimental measurements has been achieved this validates the modelling approach used in the present work and gives confidence in the quality of the results presented in the remainder of the paper 4 propeller wake analyses before explicitly analyzing the near transition and far wake regions for identification of wake instabilities the general flow characteristics are presented and discussed the wake behaviour behind a specific propeller depends strongly on how heavily loaded the blades are the advance coefficient j is indicative of the propeller loading the lower the advance coefficient the greater the difference between incoming flow velocity and the propeller tip velocity and consequently the heavier the blade loading as seen in fig 5 the wake breaks down earlier at lower advance coefficients i e when the propeller is operating at higher loading the effects of incoming flow on the rotating propeller are shown in the distribution of pressure coefficient c p p p 0 5 ρ u 2 where p is the static pressure plots on the blades front and back surfaces as well as on the hub fig 11 on the suction side of propeller blades the incoming flow accelerates and consequently the pressure drops causing most of this face to be covered in negative pressure as seen in fig 11 a d g while the pressure side of the propeller blades has maximum pressure occurring at the leading edge as shown in fig 11 c f i overall pressure maxima and minima decrease with loading this also means that the pressure difference between two sides of the blades is greater at higher loading which results in larger pressure variations inside the tip vortex core at these lower advance coefficients in fig 12 axial velocity contours are shown at three different advance coefficients on the central longitudinal xy plane at z 0 the dominant velocity pattern between the tip and hub vortices is observed to have a high velocity region followed by a relatively lower velocity region termed the velocity defect this velocity defect represents the effect of the boundary layers on the propeller blades as the flow is accelerating aft of the propeller these velocity defect regions become increasingly inclined as they travel downstream further downstream the effect of turbulence diffusion is seen when comparing the behaviour at different loading conditions the velocity gradients are reduced in both the tip vortex region and hub vortex region with decreasing loading increasing advance coefficient also the velocity defect lines are less inclined at reduced loading conditions furthermore it is highlighted that although the distance between two neighboring tip vortices increases with increasing advance coefficient the distance between adjacent velocity defect regions appears to decrease with increasing advance coefficient at lowest advance coefficient fig 12 however a one to one pairing of velocity defect regions with tip vortices is not apparent also the lowest velocity occurs in the hub region especially at the start of the hub vortex where there is negative velocity with decreasing advance coefficient this region increases in size this near hub flow suction phenomenon generated by the hub vortex is similar to what is observed in experiments di felice et al 2004 the negative velocity is also observed in a very small region in the first tip vortex attached to the blade at the lowest advance coefficient lastly at higher advance coefficient the hub vortex is able to retain its original size and shape significantly downstream the power spectral density psd of transient axial velocity fluctuations over time is also shown in fig 13 at various axial locations it can be seen that the blade effect represented by peaks at bpf and harmonics is progressively reduced along the wake length fig 14 shows the pressure contours on the same xy plane at low medium and high advance coefficients the pressure inside the vortex cores reduces as the blade loading decreases with the maximum reduction occurring in the near wake and inside the hub vortex this pressure drop contributes to cavitation inception a phenomenon which severely damages propeller blades and effects noise generation as such it is desirous to delay cavitation inception speeds as much as possible in this regard it is observed that with increasing advance coefficient both the negative pressure and the pressure variation are reduced inside the vortex cores due to reduced loading as also noted in earlier experimental works tachmindji and dickerson 1957 felli et al 2006 the stronger pressure gradients and associated stronger tip vortical filaments at lower advance coefficients also contribute to increased noise generation at higher loading conditions sharma et al 1990 4 1 near wake analysis in the near wake region the propeller wake evolves and undergoes slip stream contraction this mainly occurs due to increased axial flow in the near wake satisfying continuity felli 2007 as depicted in fig 15 also in the near wake region helical vortex sheets follow their related tip vortex and remain relatively straight although they do experience an increasingly inclined pitch angle due to cross flow felli 2007 the near wake behaviour is moreover observed along transverse yz planes at different axial locations while taking into account increasing wake pitch angle with increasing advance coefficient figs 16 and 17 show normalized vorticity magnitude contours at three different advance ratios for the near wake at various x r ratios as can be seen from these figures the helical vortex sheets remain attached to their respective tip vortex in the near wake fig 16 shows that at lower advance coefficient the tip vortex appears evolving earlier as compared with medium and higher advance in addition a stronger tip vortex is shed at lower advance coefficient due to stronger flow gradients under higher loading conditions as seen in fig 17 4 2 transition wake analysis in the transition region the propeller wake undergoes gradual destabilization therefore it is an important region to identify mechanisms leading to propeller wake instabilities apart from the usual tip and hub vortices the helical vortex sheets connecting the tip vortices and the hub vortex are also visualized here adequately as shown in fig 18 j 0 85 fig 19 j 0 65 and fig 20 j 0 45 in the longitudinal planes while fig 21 shows the helical vortex sheets progression in the transverse planes at various advance coefficients progressive bending of these helical sheets as observed in experimental work of felli 2007 is also well resolved in the current simulations as highlighted in figs 18a and 21 the relevant tip vortex positions starting after the blade tips are also numbered and referenced accordingly to aid description of the instability inceptions some new mechanisms are identified in the transition wake regions that lead to propeller wake instabilities first at higher advance coefficients as highlighted in fig 18a clear mutual interaction between adjacent helical vortex sheets is observed shortly after the helical sheets start fragmenting into smaller vortical structures helical sheet vortices this mutual interaction starts near the base of the helical vortex sheets as there is a counter rotating hub vortex which is also stronger thicker than the tip vortex and is preceded by sheets stretching or inclination starting from tip vortex position 4 fig 18a the vorticity and velocity gradients induced between the tip and hub vortices lead to the larger pitch variation of the sheets and their bending this contributes to the bringing of adjacent sheets closer together and thereby enhancing the observed mutual interaction of the sheet vortices furthermore fig 18b shows that this mutual interaction is accompanied by short wave instabilities in the tip vortical filaments and at the same time these sheets begin to detach from their parent tip vortex tip vortex position 5 fig 18a ultimately starting interaction with the previously shed tip vortex at about x r 3 5 at tip vortex position 7 for this higher advance coefficient case j 0 85 as shown in fig 18a this detachment and subsequent reattachment completes at about tip vortex position 9 for this case once this occurs we can see that breakup in the tip vortical filament begins along with initiation of long wave instabilities as highlighted at tip vortex position 10 x r 5 in the fig 18b next at medium advance coefficient j 0 65 fig 19 the helical sheets mutual interaction hs mi moderates as the vortex sheets become detached from their parent tip vortex quickly consequently these helical sheets start interacting with the previously shed tip vortex at a much earlier stage x r 1 8 at tip vortex position 4 as highlighted in fig 19a the interaction and subsequent reattachment with the preceding tip vortex completes at tip vortex position 5 6 again once this transpires the breakup of the tip vortical filaments begins as highlighted at tip vortex position 7 x r 3 in fig 19b along with the appearance of long wave instabilities for the lowest advance coefficient j 0 45 fig 20 hs mi is not observable rather the helical vortex sheets interact only with the tip vortices however it is noted that the helical sheets seem to skip a tip vortex after detaching from the parent tip vortex and subsequently attaching with preceding tip vortex as shown in fig 20a once this interaction with the previously shed tip vortex occurs just after x r 1 the short wave instabilities start to appear as highlighted in fig 20b followed by long wave instabilities subsequently the wake breakup initiation begins after about x r 2 as depicted in fig 20b it is suggested that the helical vortex sheets are distorted by a velocity field induced by the tip and hub vortices at higher advance coefficient this induced velocity field is small so that the distortion of the sheets is gradual consequently sheets remain attached to their associated tip vortex for a long time and the interaction of adjacent sheet vortices is delayed as the advance coefficient decreases the induced velocity increases and the helical sheets are convected and distorted more rapidly accelerating the onset of hs mi this induces a faster separation of these sheets from their parent tip vortex for the lowest advance coefficient considered j 0 45 the induced velocity field is so strong that the helical sheets are stripped from their parent tip vortices immediately separated sheets then get convected and distorted downstream rapidly passing multiple tip vortices and inducing instability earlier than the other cases further and as discussed earlier the sheets are composed of two layers of opposing signs figs 18a 19a and 20a due to blade boundary layers on each side generating separate sheet layers di felice et al 2004 it is further seen that the layer with the same sign as the tip vortex and shed from the suction side appears to be attached to the tip vortex while further in board mid way in the radial direction it overlaps and attaches with the other opposing sheet coming from the pressure side and corresponds more with the root region however with decreasing advance coefficient fig 20a vs 18a the sheet from the pressure side opposing sign stays stronger near the tip vortex which is also therefore suggested to be a cause of greater instabilities at the lower advance coefficients the short and long wave instabilities as mentioned by widnall 1972 are observed as highlighted in fig 18 j 0 85 fig 19 j 0 65 and fig 20 j 0 45 as expected both short and long wave instabilities commence earlier with decreasing advance coefficient however at the lowest advance coefficient the long wave instabilities follow the short wave instabilities fairly quickly in general terms the long wave instabilities appear about two cycles after the shortwave instabilities at the higher advance coefficient j 0 85 about one cycle at medium advance coefficient j 0 65 and about half a cycle at the lowest advance coefficient j 0 45 these figures also indicate that at the same time when the sheet vortices start interacting and initiating the commencement of instabilities in the tip vortex the hub vortex also undergoes twisting and starts transitioning towards instability mutual interaction of the tip vortical filaments eventually plays the dominant role in the far wake breakup but that itself is initiated by the mutual interaction among adjacent helical vortex sheets as to be detailed in the proceeding section section 4 3 far wake analyses fig 21 shows the wake behaviour at the three advance coefficients as observed on transverse planes yz at different axial distances for the transition region the helical vortex sheets become detached from their tip vortex relatively quickly at medium advance coefficient leading to earlier commencement of wake instabilities and thus quicker wake breakdown as compared to higher advance coefficient further tip vortices at the lowest advance coefficient are much stronger compared to those at the medium advance coefficient whereas the tip vortices at the medium advance coefficient are moderately stronger as compared to those at the higher advance coefficient fig 21 also shows that at higher advance coefficient the helical sheet vortices have similar magnitude vorticity as is for their respective tip vortices as the advance coefficient decreases and associated blade loading increasing the strength of the helical sheet vortices relative to their corresponding tip vortices decreases 4 3 far wake analysis in the far wake the propeller wake breaks down completely as depicted in figs 22 25 below the mutual interaction among tip vortical filaments in the propeller far wake leads to leap frogging and this is captured in the numerical results these are similar to those observed in experiments felli et al 2011 in fig 23 using inter filament distances it is shown when and how mutual interaction among tip vortical filaments takes place of the four tip vortex filaments from the four blades two pairs are formed fig 23c shows distance between the two pairing filaments while fig 23d shows distance between all the four consecutive filaments as discussed in the preceding section wake breakup begins after the helical vortex sheets start interacting with the previously shed tip vortex fig 23c highlights that soon after the mutual interaction among the adjacent helical sheets x r 2 5 at j 0 85 and x r 1 8 at j 0 65 the distance among filaments starts to decrease and this inter filament distance starts to decrease rapidly after reattachment followed by interaction of helical sheets with the preceding tip vortex x r 5 5 at j 0 85 and x r 3 at j 0 65 once this distance approaches zero leap frogging occurs with the subsequent complete breakdown of the tip vortical filaments also a comparison is made with the lowest advance coefficient and as expected distance among pairing filaments decreases rapidly as compared to higher advance coefficients at the lowest advance coefficients the inter filament distance is already reduced and falls rapidly contributing to earlier breakdown as compared to higher advance coefficients additionally it is observed that a reduction in the distance between one filament pair results in an increase in the separation distance between this filament pair and the other pair of filaments represented in the fig 23b by troughs and crests respectively fig 24 shows the propeller wake vortical structures and mutual inductance among filaments before the breakup thorough half a cycle of propeller revolution at incremental instances of time at j 0 45 while fig 25 shows propeller wake vortical structures thorough a full cycle of propeller revolution at incremental instances of time at j 0 65 as highlighted in both figs 24 and 25 the filaments start mutual interaction and then there is the leap frogging mechanism and finally the breakdown among other details in figs 24 and 25 the mutual inductance and leap frogging effect can be observed in similar pattern as that observed in experimental work by felli et al 2011 in the transition region it was observed in preceding section that the hub vortex starts to twist when mutual interaction among helical sheets commences this twisting is representative of short wave instabilities in the hub vortex fig 25 shows that long wave instabilities start to appear in the hub vortex only after complete breakdown of the tip vortical filaments therefore in the far wake region the mutual interaction among tip vortical filaments completes the wake breakdown instigated in the transition region due to the helical vortex sheets mutual interaction 5 quantitative wake analyses 5 1 principal component analyses to have inclusive determination of propeller wake instabilities mathematical analyses of the propeller wake are carried out by quantifying short wave instabilities for this purpose the principal component analysis pca is performed on the cfd data the propeller wake is broken down into segments by cutting planes through the vortical structures at successive intervals 5 along the full circumference the segmenting results in two dimensional tip vortical cross sections at each plane along the spatial wake length one such plane is shown in fig 26 for each of the resulting tip vortices cross sections pca is performed which is further weighted by vorticity mathematically the weighted mean x i w and the covariance matrix c i are formulated as given by yu and turk 2010 based on work of koren and carmel 2003 16 x i w j w i j x j j w i j 17 c i j w i j x j x i w x j x i w j w i j where x j and w i j represent the mesh nodal points and corresponding vorticity values at these nodes inside a tip vortex cross section next the eigenvalues λ are computed based on the covariance matrix c i for each of the tip vortex cross section essentially pca obtained eigenvalues thus define anisotropy of vortices cross sections which we call vortex core circularity vcc higher vcc defined by higher normalized eigenvalue indicates that the tip vortex is circular in shape and stable while lower eigenvalues indicate increasing short wave instabilities and that the vortex has lost its original shape fig 26 eigenvalues of the cross sections are then traced for each of the four filaments along their respective lengths the mean λ is obtained by taking arithmetic average along all the four filament lengths fig 27 shows trendcurve moving average of mean vortex core circularity plotted at the lower medium and higher advance coefficients it can be seen from these charts fig 27 that at lower advance coefficient the eigenvalues start to decrease rapidly in near wake immediately after evolution while at higher advance coefficient the eigenvalues drop at slower rates and further downstream the decreasing eigenvalues vcc means increasing short wave instabilities because the wake breakdowns quickly at lower advance coefficients this indicates that vortex core circularity plays an important role in wake stability as the tip vortex is able to maintain its circular shape with increasing advance coefficients the wake breaks down further downstream at higher advance coefficients in the preceding sections a new mechanism hs mi is identified as instability initiator especially at higher advance coefficients it was further observed that this mutual interaction among adjacent sheets is accompanied by short wave instabilities in tip vortex filaments these visual qualitative findings are confirmed by the quantitative analyses as described here fig 27 corroborates that soon after the mutual interaction among the adjacent helical sheets x r 2 5 at j 0 85 and x r 1 8 at j 0 65 the vortex core circularity starts to decrease rapidly as indicated by the corresponding vertical dotted lines lastly in the far wake quantitative analyses section 4 3 it was shown that inter filament distance starts to decrease rapidly after reattachment of sheets with the preceding tip vortex x r 5 5 at j 0 85 and x r 3 at j 0 65 corresponding to these spatial locations we see that the vortex core circularity distorts to below the 0 6 λ value indicated by horizontal dashed line for all the advance coefficients 5 2 wake envelope analyses the instability mechanisms suggested in this article are also supported by the wake envelope instability analyses these instability analyses of the wake streamtube carried out here are similar to that performed by felli et al 2011 and also by kumar and mahesh 2017 felli et al 2011 extracted the wake streamtube curve from the standard deviation image calculated over 1000 time history visualizations of the wake vortical structures whereas kumar and mahesh 2017 traced the wake envelope from the azimuthal averaged axial velocity contour plots the wake envelope extracted in current work is obtained from the mean axial velocity profiles similar to kumar and mahesh 2017 one such averaged axial velocity contour plot with red region showing the area where axial flow velocity is lower than the free stream velocity is shown in the fig 28 below for clarity the wake vortical structures are also embedded in the same fig 28 from an instantaneous moment in time after that the axial locations of the tip vortex instability inception positions iips are determined similar to the method proposed by felli et al 2011 the criterion by felli et al 2011 for iip is defined as the first position at which the wake envelope of tip vortices diverges suddenly after the slipstream contraction where such a divergence equals 50 of the maximum slope of the envelope foremost we are interested in the first region of the wake envelope to undergo significant radial expansion with the corresponding x r value called iip fig 29 shows the wake envelope near this first radial expansion for j 0 85 using this procedure the iips for the two main advance coefficients considered j 0 85 and j 0 65 are computed and plotted against those obtained from the experiments fig 30 the comparison is satisfactory although for j 0 85 point the experimental data is extrapolated importantly the wake envelope analyses shows that the transition to instability begins at x r 1 5 fig 30 for the main advance coefficient j 0 85 being analyzed here recalling from the transition wake analyses in section 4 2 it is emphasized that not long after this instability inception position x r 1 5 helical vortex sheets start stretching or inclination tip vortex position 4 fig 18a followed by mutual interaction among the adjacent sheets fig 18a and short waves start appearing in the tip vortical filaments fig 18b also after this point the helical vortex sheets start becoming detached from their parent tip vortex fig 18a similar observations are made for the medium advance coefficient j 0 65 considered in the study though at a moderate level it is therefore concluded that with the helical sheets detachment after their stretching and mutual interaction tip vortices are pushed outwards thus beginning the transition to instability 6 instability mechanisms the helical vortex sheets and their role in instability mechanisms have been mentioned in earlier works notably di felice et al 2004 observed the helical vortex sheets detachment from respective tip vortex which are subsequently rolled up by the preceding tip vortex this helical sheets and the preceding tip vortex interaction hs ptv i was observed for a medium advance coefficient j 0 75 and along the longitudinal plane mainly while the hub vortex was not shown the lower advance coefficients were not considered di felice et al 2004 and this phenomenon could not be observed at higher advance coefficients j 0 88 and j 1 01 considered in the study due to limited measurement windows length di felice et al 2004 later felli et al 2006 using pressure measurements evaluation of energy transfer from blade to shaft harmonics and observing the precession of the streamtube around the hub vortex confirmed that the transition to instability starts when the helical sheets begin interacting with the preceding tip vortex okulov and sørensen 2007 concluded that far wake models based on joukowski s model joukowski 1912 are unconditionally unstable due to the consideration of constant circulation over the blade span spanwise blade circulation however is not constant and the wake stabilized when helical vortex sheets resulting from the spanwise varying circulation are incorporated into the model okulov and sørensen 2007 okulov and sørensen 2007 also opined that the complete roll up of the sheets leads to standalone tip vortices and eventual wake instability felli et al 2011 however emphasized that the mutual interaction among tip vortical filaments tv mi plays the major role in ship propeller wake instabilities rather than the complete roll up of sheets they based this conclusion on same intensity tip vortex filaments breaking further and further downstream upon increasing the number of blades though advance coefficient had to be increased too the reason being as the roll up of the sheets is dictated by the strength of the tip vortex attached to their end the same intensity filament should break at similar distances interestingly citing their prior works di felice et al 2004 felli et al 2006 felli et al 2011 ended the discussion by arguing that when the sheets interact with the previously shed tip vortex the parent tip vortex ultimately becomes detached from its sheet and thus in effect becomes isolated and that this deserves a future study the present work is a step forward in this suggested direction the interaction of helical sheet vortices with the tip vortex is suggested as a possible cause for wake instability by kumar and mahesh 2017 however in a different way their les work analyzed a weakly loaded tip propeller shedding weaker tip vortices as compared to the insean e779a propeller studied in this work and other works mentioned here di felice et al 2004 felli et al 2011 2006 the propeller analyzed by kumar and mahesh 2017 has more blades five and only a single higher advance coefficient j 0 889 was considered in their study for such a case kumar and mahesh 2017 they argued that the mutual inductance among tip vortices is not strong enough with the result that the helical sheets take time and undergo complete roll up not only in the transverse but also somewhat in the longitudinal plane the sheets however detach quickly not only from the tip vortices but also break into smaller concentrated vortices leaving behind standalone but stable tip vortices in the near wake ultimately they argued that this leads to mutual inductance between rolled up and isolated sheet vortices and the preceding tip vortices causing wake instability while also claiming it to be different than the hs ptv i observed by di felice et al 2004 posa et al 2019 contended that some phenomena similar to sheet fragmentation as seen by kumar and mahesh 2017 might be there but that the main sources of isolated vortices in the sheet region are the additional structures shed from the blade suction side for their case of highly loaded seven bladed marine propeller operating at lower advance coefficients further the hub vortex and the additional helical vortices coming from the near root region survive for much larger distances as compared to the tip vortices especially at the lower advance coefficients while the tip vortices just vanish without any filament interactions in the mid wake region similar to kumar and mahesh 2017 and at equivalent locations for all advance coefficients that posa et al 2019 considered lastly in posa et al 2019 visualizations it is seen that the helical sheets roll up and bend much more in the longitudinal plane beginning a very early hs ptv i which they also associated with wake instabilities however in both these latest works kumar and mahesh 2017 posa et al 2019 the tip vortical filament interactions and subsequent leap frogging could not be observed due to their propeller geometry and operating conditions here we have linked these phenomena with in depth visualizations and quantifications while addressing gaps in the current literature based on the observations from this work detailed visually in section 4 2 and quantitatively in sections 4 3 5 1 and 5 2 hs mi is likely to be an instabilities initiating mechanism leading to propeller wake breakup particularly at higher advance coefficients this effect reduces as the advance coefficient decreases and at the lowest advance coefficient considered here there is an apparent skipping of tip vortex by helical sheets while detaching and reattaching of the latter however it is suggested that the mechanisms observed for the higher advance coefficients may still occur but much more rapidly and hence are harder to detect nevertheless at higher advance coefficients hs mi is shown as an important mechanism contributing to the onset of propeller wake instabilities at higher advance coefficients the wake length is long enough to study the wake behaviour appropriately and therefore the wake instability initiation as proposed here is significant next the analyses of the transition wake presented here support the di felice at al 2004 and felli et al 2006 hs ptv i observations in the preceding sections it is detailed that the break down of tip vortical filaments starts soon after the helical vortex sheets complete the interaction fully reattach rolled by with the preceding tip vortex further it is shown that when this helical sheet tip vortex reattachment occurs hs ptv i long wave instabilities grow and the mutual filament distance starts decreasing rapidly tv mi leading to leap frogging of tip vortices with the reattached and already rolled up sheets and eventual wake breakdown as for the concentrated tip vortices felli et al 2011 we observe that these start to appear at tip vortex position 6 fig 18a and at x r 2 34 fig 21 for the higher advance coefficient however the wake does not destabilize immediately though instabilities continue this leads us to two possibilities either the detached sheets stabilize the wake by supporting the subsequent tip vortices during the detachment reattachment phase re stabilized vcc is noticed at corresponding x r 3 5 5 region fig 27 until the sheets become fully reattached at tip vortex position 9 fig 18a alternatively the sheets remain linked fig 18a and the tip vortices are not as concentrated as they seem in these two possibilities the earlier discussion in this paragraph holds fully true i e the tv mi felli et al 2011 conclusively culminates the transition instabilities that begin with hs mi current work and are amplified by the hs ptv i di felice et al 2004 the phase averaged turbulent kinetic energy tke observations confirm these findings with a sample field shown in fig 31 below for completeness it can be seen that initially the sheet region undergoes instability followed by the tip vortices region with highest levels of tke seen in the tv mi region hub vortex remains stable however higher levels of tke seen in the near wake correspond to initial separation effects at hub some form of the sheets fragmentation phenomena as mentioned by kumar and mahesh 2017 is also observed for the more heavily loaded tip propeller though at lightly loaded conditions j 0 85 figs 18a and 21 studied in the present work for the first time fig 18a clearly shows helical vortex sheets fragmenting into smaller vortical structures around tip vortex positions 2 and 3 followed by attraction of sheet vortices at tip vortex position 4 towards tip vortex position 5 and subsequently of those at 5 towards tip vortex positioned at 6 this attraction continues with ultimate detachment of helical vortex sheets occurring at tip vortex position 7 these detached sheet vortices start interacting with the preceding tip vortex 8 while the sheet vortices of tip vortex 8 become fully reattached at tip vortex position 9 however it is emphasized that apart from fragmentation the hs tv i in the axial plane is more like the experimental visualizations of di felice et al 2004 and less like those in kumar and mahesh 2017 and posa et al 2019 some similar observations to posa et al 2019 regarding additional vortical structures can also be seen for instance in fig 18b the additional structures in between the tip and hub vortical filaments can be clearly seen with those near the root region with larger pitch surviving longer up to about x r 4 as compared to those near the intermediate or tip region still these additional structures are nowhere a match to tip or hub vortices which survive relatively much longer at all loading conditions for the ship propeller analyzed here although at some locations these additional structures seem to overlap the sheet regions which can be seen in fig 18c where the vortical structures are super imposed on the vorticity plane it is contended that the general source seems to be the sheets and their fragmentation in the current case instead this may be due to difference in propeller geometries and operating conditions as for the transverse planes fig 21 shows the roll up of helical vortex sheets at tip vortex positions 4 and 5 for j 0 85 similar to that observed by di felice et al 2004 felli et al 2008 and kumar and mahesh 2017 figs 17 and 21 also show that the roll up phenomenon is reduced for the medium advance coefficient of j 0 65 further fig 17 shows that the sheets start interacting with the preceding tip vortex without any apparent roll up for the lowest advance coefficient j 0 45 considered here the decreased roll up with decreasing advance coefficient is compensated by increased mutual interaction among tip vortical filaments as observed in the visualizations section 4 2 and as quantified by the filament gap analyses section 4 3 this again confirms the earlier finding of di felice et al 2004 and felli et al 2006 and corroborates the latter findings of felli et al 2011 and magionesi et al 2018 that is the tv mi is more dominant at lower advance coefficients due to less inter filament distance and thicker tip vortices in summary the hs mi is proposed as a mechanism contributing to instigate the ship propeller wake instabilities this transition to instability is closely followed by short wave instabilities in the tip vortical filaments and sheet detachment initiations at lightly loaded condition j 0 85 specifically we also observe the fragmentation of helical sheets into smaller sheet vortices and their definite roll up in the transverse plane but somewhat less roll up and more inclination bending and subsequent attraction and interaction with the preceding tip vortices like that of di felice et al 2004 and felli et al 2008 later the hs ptv i accelerates the variation of inter filament distance thus initiating the tv mi ultimately it is the actual tv mi interaction that produces long wave instabilities eventually leading to leap frogging of the tip vortical filaments in two pairs for the four bladed propeller considered this is followed by complete wake breakdown first in the tip vortical filaments and then by waves in the hub vortex and eventually its breakdown also relevant instability mechanisms as observed in various prior studies are thus shown to be correlated in current work with their reliance on operating conditions also highlighted 7 conclusions an analysis of propeller wake flow field has been completed by employing large eddy simulations for different loading conditions j 0 45 j 0 65 and j 0 85 numerical verification and validation has been completed the later by comparing the propeller open water and wake flow characteristics with available experimental data for the selected benchmark ship propeller insean e779a at various advance coefficients from low j 0 45 to medium j 0 65 to high j 0 85 the propeller wake geometry and hydrodynamic characteristics have been described from evolution to breakdown through these descriptions it is inferred that wmles is effective for the evaluation of propeller wake flow structures especially at higher reynolds numbers wmles can provide valuable information on both propeller wake geometry and also on the wake breakdown mechanisms this is useful at industry design stage as wmles uses fairly lower density grid able to be solved with practical computational resources additionally gaps in our understanding of the fundamental physics related to mechanisms leading to propeller wake instabilities have been investigated instabilities are initiated in the transition region and a new instability mechanism has been identified specifically the hs mi which occurs in the transition region is shown to be a possible cause of propeller wake instability particularly at higher advance coefficients j 0 85 at medium advance coefficient j 0 65 this mutual interaction among adjacent helical vortex sheets reduces in intensity however it still seems to play a role in initiating instability mechanisms at lowest advance coefficient j 0 45 the instability initiation is related to the skipping of tip vortex by the helical vortex sheets after this skipping process the interaction of helical vortex sheets and previously shed tip vortices precedes the occurrence of tip vortical filament breakdown it is suggested that velocity field between tip and hub vortices distorts helical sheets and that the weakening velocity field with increasing advance coefficient fig a1 vs fig a2 results in a more stable wake at higher advance coefficients the helical vortex sheets effects seem to reduce as advance coefficient decreases however it is suggested that their interactions still occur but much more rapidly due to increasingly stronger velocity fields fig a2 vs fig a1 and hence are difficult to notice in any case at higher advance coefficients the wake length is long enough to study all the wake mechanisms and therefore the instability mechanisms and their inter relations as proposed here are significant furthermore it is shown how the distance between adjacent tip vortical filaments decreases soon after hs mi and this decrease escalates once hs ptv i ensues this decreasing distance eventually leads to tv mi followed by leap frogging and complete breakdown in the far wake essentially thus hs mi is shown as a new and possibly important breakup triggering mechanism especially at higher advance coefficients further the various instability mechanisms are shown to be correlated it is proposed that the tv mi felli et al 2011 conclusively culminates the transition instabilities that begin possibly with hs mi current work and are amplified by the hs ptv i di felice et al 2004 additionally some reduced forms of sheet fragmenations kumar and mahesh 2017 and additional vortical structures posa et al 2019 are also observed for e779a making this study

appendix a numerical verification numerical verification is performed at the highest and lowest loading conditions considered thus encompassing the limits of the les analyses performed the thrust and torque coefficients are compared at j 0 45 and j 0 88 at three different grids considered first the relatively coarser mesh with 12 million cells then the medium mesh with 18 million cells and finally the finest mesh of 24 million cells considered for the analyses reported in the current work in preceding sections the table below shows the results with satisfactory grid independence verification

coefficients are predicted with good precision and accuracy even by the coarsest mesh employing whether unsteady rans or steady rans or les therefore for a further and appropriate numerical verification of les the flow features are also compared for instance and shown here for various grid refinement levels phase averaged axial velocity values are compared on a line in the near wake at x r 0 2 and extending from the propeller hub cap through to the center of tip vortex the results shown in the figs a 1 and a 2 are at the highest advance coefficient of j 0 88 and the lowest coefficient of j 0 45 respectively as can be seen from the axial velocity comparison the 12 million mesh slightly under predicts velocity peaks and valleys in the tip vortex region with the 18 million mesh results converging towards the results obtained with the 24 million mesh schroeder 2014 carried out numerical verification for les of marine propellers by comparing the tip vortex resolution between two grid sizes in the near wake and on a plane in a similar manner fig a3 shows the tip vortex and sheets resolution at about x r 1 15 for all the three mesh resolutions considered along with mesh employed there are about 250 cells in the tip vortex region of the finest mesh 24 million in this plane and this exact mesh is simply extruded up to 12 propeller radii downstream with the height of resulting prisms fixed at a similar size there will be more cells at further lower coefficients as the tip vortex becomes correspondingly thicker the vortices resolution is also shown in the longitudinal plane in fig a 4 in both planes it can be seen that while there is numerical dissipation of vortices by the coarsest mesh the vortex resolution at medium mesh starts approaching the

21628,supersonic gaseous jets with large ambient pressure are typically found in deep water propulsion systems the interactions between gas and water are turbulent and the plume exhibits unstable bubbly interfaces this work employed both experimental and numerical methods to obtain the flow structures of over expanded gaseous jets driven by different pressure ratios in water direct measurements of the interfacial behaviour of submerged gaseous jets with pressurised water were performed using high speed digital photography numerical simulations were also conducted to characterise flow structures by the interplay of inertia and buoyancy forces it was found that the interface of injection into water showed continuous fluctuations and strong mixing in the conical regions the intermittent expansion necking characteristics just beyond the nozzle exit induced the pressure oscillation of the flow field near the wall localised liquid water attack of the exit wall and aggravated the over expansion of nozzle working conditions these periodic phenomena were attributed to kelvin helmholtz k h instabilities driven by the large gradients of velocity and density in the shearing layers the oscillation characteristics were assessed at different ambient pressures providing theoretical support for the design of engineering devices working over a wide range of water depths keywords submerged gaseous jet deep water propulsion intermittent expansion necking characteristics thrust oscillation kelvin helmholtz instability 1 introduction the plume of a solid rocket motor srm for a submerged vehicle is a supersonic turbulent gaseous jet expelled into a denser ambient liquid phase and this kind of gas injection into liquid is also encountered in metallurgical chemical and nuclear industrial applications hoefele and brimacombe 1979 labotz 1965 gulawani 2007 for deep water propulsion the effect of high pressure ambient water should be considered completely when the water depth is increased the nozzle pressure ratio stagnation pressure over ambient pressure p 0 p a of a fixed size nozzle will decrease so that the nozzle might be operated in over expanded conditions where the external water pressure might adversely affect nozzle performance and induce flow separation nguyen 2003 olson and lele 2013 ferguson 1969 compared with shallow water and air environments the aqueous phase with high pressure and large inertia will block the expansion of the gas an important characteristic of such injection into water is unsteadiness and its induced complex shearing effect in deep water the shearing interaction between two phases will be more intense as the gas phase will be compressed to a greater extent and the velocity boundary and phase boundary will interact with each other resulting in the fluctuation of interfaces and oscillation of the back pressure zhang et al 2018 because of the large velocity and density gradients present in different phases of such submerged gaseous jets the two phase interfaces are always unstable and non linear accompanied with fluctuations vortices and gas entrainment in different phases zhou and yu 2015 this is evident in engineering devices and is evinced by other experimental observations harby 2014 he et al 2015 miao 2016 however the underlying mechanism of flow field behaviour and the characteristics of such gaseous jets in deep water are still not well understood previous studies of submerged gaseous jets focus mainly on their working in under expanded conditions where the pressure ratio is relatively high and the pressure of the ambient water is low loth et al loth and faeth 1989 loth and faeth 1989 loth and faeth 1990 conducted experiments on the structure of planar under expanded air jets in a water filled open tank they found that the shock wave containing external expansion air jet core was maintained for some distance downstream of the passage exit until finally turbulent mixing and entrainment prevail which is much shorter thus faster decaying than air to air jets fronzeo et al fronzeo and kinzel 2016 also proved this difference by changing the ambient density from 1 kg m 3 to 1000 kg m 3 using compressible multiphase computational fluid dynamics cfd with turbulence resolving simulations shi et al shi et al 2010 shi et al 2010 conducted a series of experimental studies on the oscillation flow characteristics of submerged supersonic gaseous jets issuing from laval nozzles in a water tank they reported that oscillation of pressure with different frequencies occurred near the nozzle exit and they proposed that back attack in this region was a shock wave feedback phenomenon tang et al tang et al 2012 tang et al 2011 tang et al 2011 tang et al 2010 proposed four typical processes in morphological terms to illustrate the oscillation of the flow field using computational simulation they also used a finite time lyapunov exponent ftle field to identify the structures of multiphase flows and captured the interface vortex region arghode et al arghode 2008 arghode and gupta 2012 and wilson et al wilson 1992 designed experiments in submerged systems with normal temperature pressurised air and high temperature gas respectively using different nozzle exit cross sections they found that two phase instabilities downstream of the jet region were closely coupled with the pressure fluctuations in the gas chamber han et al han et al 2017 used experimental results from an underwater laboratory scale hybrid rocket to show more intensive instability of thrust compared with that in air in addition the pulsation decayed quickly underwater and the growth and collapse of the gas bubble causing the pressure pulse did likewise tang et al tang et al 2015 tang and li 2019 found that buoyancy effects can result in the momentum of force in submerged horizontal gas propulsion and the thrust showed different orders of oscillatory characteristics similar studies into the oscillation of flow near the nozzle exit were also addressed by gong et al gong et al 2017 qin et al qin 2016 liu et al liu et al 2015 and weiland et al weiland 2013 in their research the pinch off position was observed at different pressure ratios and different mass flow rates and the jets turned from the bubble regime to jetting regime with changes in gas flow rate research into gas injection in deeper water mostly focusses on water depths of less than 50 m jia et al jia et al 2015 undertook experiments in a pressurised water vessel to observe the plume of gaseous jets at a water depth of 10 m the solid propellant gas generator was adopted as the gas resources they used high speed cameras to capture the growth of the changing underwater ignition wake and the evolution thereof it was concluded that low amplitude oscillations accompanied with high amplitude events were fundamental to underwater wake flow from a solid rocket motor tang et al tang et al 2011 used a gas generator and an underwater testing system to investigate the growth and evolution of gas bubbles in supersonic gas jets at a water depth of 30 m the experimental results show that the growth and collapse of the gas bubble causes the pressure pulse and the pulsation can quickly decay under water ferguson 1969 conducted depth simulation in a horizontal pressure vessel using n2 he evaluated the lower and upper positions of the separation plane as a function of chamber pressure and ambient pressure from 0 1 mpa to 2 0 mpa all these studies of gas injection into liquid are mainly focused on plume observation and gross parameters such as penetration length no further hydrodynamic flow structures have been studied for underwater propulsion the oscillation of pressure in the wake flow could result in an additional force on the back wall of the vehicle and further changes the actual thrust delivered by the underwater working motor causing the trajectory of the vehicle to deviate from that designed previous research have shown that the interaction of gas and water is the main cause of oscillations in the wake zhang 2019 when the gas is ejected the high speed gas and the water environment form a shear layer and the shear layer is unstable which is also called kelvin helmholtz k h instability chawla chawla 1975a 1975b investigated the instability of the gas liquid interface of a sonic gas into the liquid pool using k h instability analysis he established a model describing the phenomenon of liquid entrainment resulting from the presence of k h instability at the gas liquid interface it was shown that the transfer of energy from the gas phase to the liquid layer predominantly governed the interface instability and the wave amplitude was a function of density ratio viscosity and so on chan et al chan 1994 also using the theory of k h instability to analyse the phenomena of non reacting and reacting sonic jets into liquid concluded that interfacial evaporation was found to enhance the instability while interfacial condensation reduced the instability weiland et al weiland 2013 investigated the relative importance of rayleigh taylor r t and kelvin helmholtz instabilities on the submerged gas jet boundary he adopted the instability mechanisms given by epstein epstein et al 2001 and found that r t effect is equally important as that of k h instability if an estimate of the axial velocity was used however the estimation is sensitive to the gas velocity used in the calculation in the shearing layer of such gas jets the gradient of velocity and density drives the k h instability mechanism here both experimental and computational methods were adopted in studying the flow patterns of a supersonic gaseous jet under large ambient pressure 1 0 3 0 mpa and the mechanism of unsteadiness near the nozzle exit a pressurised water vessel was used for simulating different water depth environments pressurised air was ejected into the water tank through a converging diverging nozzle by adjusting the pressure ratio the nozzle was working in over expanded condition given the complexities and difficulties inherent to the visualisation of such experiments especially for the wave structures of the gas in the core cfd simulation was employed to find the profiles of the flow field and to study large scale coherent oscillations of the interfaces the structure of this paper is as follows section 2 describes the detailed experimental apparatus and image processing technology the numerical analysis methodology involving the computational domain is presented in section 3 detailed results and discussion are presented in section 4 wherein the jet structures in experiments and cfd simulations are compared in section 4 1 the over expanded conditions in different pressure ratio states are described in section 4 2 the flow structures of intermittent expansion necking characteristics are depicted in section 4 3 the effect of oscillation out of the nozzle in different water depth is calculated as described in section 4 4 and the underlying mechanism driving k h instabilities of the interfaces is explained in section 4 5 2 experimental methods 2 1 experimental setup to construct a deep water environment a vertical pressure water vessel vpwv was designed as shown in fig 1 the size of the main cylinder part of the vpwv was 500 1000 mm and two operation windows two observation windows two lighting windows were installed at equal intervals around the water vessel two gas inlet outlet valves a water inlet valve and cable ports were installed on the top cover after filling the vessel with a certain depth of water the air inlet on the top can be inflated and pressurised to simulate a water depth of 100 300 m the laval nozzle was installed in the central post on the bottom fig 2 a non return valve and plugs were used to prevent the water from flowing back into the nozzle the expansion ratio of nozzle was 1 5625 with a designed mach number of 1 9 at the nozzle exit a schematic of the whole system of experimental apparatus is shown in fig 3 compressed air stored in a gas tank was used both as the source gas of the gas jet and as the source gas of inflating gas after installing the nozzle the test procedure was as follows first the vessel was filled with water from the water inlet on the top for a water depth of 1 m then the vessel was inflated from the gas inlet valve to ensure that the pressure of air within meets the required test conditions finally when the electromagnetic valve was open set as the time zero the gas with a total pressure of 6 7 mpa flows through the pipeline and nozzle into the still water a halogen lamp were put on the lighting window side for illuminating the jet a high speed camera phantom veo 410l was used to capture the flow structure of gaseous jets in water at a frame interval of 100 μs all the raw images recorded have a resolution of 300 300 pixels 2 2 image processing technology the raw images obtained from the high speed camera were processed to get quantitative information about the morphology of jets and gas water interface matlab coding was used to process the acquired images from each test firstly the rgb images were grey scaled and a high pass gaussian filter was applied to remove low frequency noise and improve contrast between the gas and the water medium then the images were adjusted in brightness and contrast and changed by phase reversal to make the background white for better observation the penetration of the gas were measured to make comparison with numerical results the statistical results of jet area were quantitatively studied through the capture of image pixels the image pixels of a single image is 154 352 pixels after image cropping the distribution of jet under different conditions is quantitatively studied by measuring the pixels in each part within the jet boundary 3 numerical simulation methodology 3 1 governing equations for supersonic gaseous jets underwater considering body forces such as gravity buoyancy and surface tension the governing equations are listed as follows ferziger and peric 1999 continuous conservation equation 1 ρ m t ρ m u i x i 0 momentum conservation equation 2 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j p x i y x j μ m u i x j u j x i f i f csf energy conservation equation 3 t k w g α k ρ k e k x j u j k w g α k

represents the properties of the mixture which can be specified as density coefficient of viscosity and so on it can be written as ϕ m ϕ g α g ϕ w 1 α g subscript w denotes water and g gas k eff is the effective thermal conductivity k eff k t k k t is the turbulent thermal conductivity 3 2 vof multiphase model the vof multiphase model was used to trace the interfaces between different phases the model tracks two or more immiscible fluid interfaces by solving momentum equations and phase volume fraction equations it is widely used in the prediction of jet break up the motion of large bubbles in liquid and dam break problems in engineering for numerical study of gaseous jets in water the vof model has been validated tang et al 2011 tang et al 2015 the phase volume fraction conservation equation is 4 t α q ρ q α q ρ q v q s α q p 1 n m p q m q p where α q is volume fraction of phase q ρ q is the density of phase q v q is velocity of phase q s α q is the source item of phase q m p q is the mass flow rate from phase q to phase p and m q p is the converse transfer rate the phase volume fraction is constrained by the following requirement 5 q 1 n α q 1 here two phases are considered phase q is defined as water the density of which is 998 2 kg m 3 the dynamic viscosity is 1 003 10 3 pa s phase p is an ideal gas as governed by the equation of state p ρ r t the dynamic viscosity of gas is 1 7894 10 5 pa s both two phases have no additional generated sources and no mass transfer occurs between them i e the right hand of the phase volume fraction conservation equation is zero 3 3 turbulence model the shear stress transport sst k ω model was adopted to describe the turbulent flow which contains the turbulence kinetic energy k and the specific dissipation rate ω transport equation 6 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j γ k k x j g k y k s k 7 t ρ ω x i ρ ω u i x j γ ω ω x j g ω y ω d ω s ω where g k represents the production of turbulence kinetic energy g ω is the generation of ω γ k γ ω represent the effective diffusivity of k and ω respectively y k y ω represent the dissipation of k and ω due to turbulence d ω represents the cross diffusion term and s k and s ω are user defined source terms the standard k ω model and the transformed k ε model are both multiplied by a blending function designed to be one in the near wall region which activates the standard k ω model and zero away from the surface which activates the transformed k ε model 3 4 gravity buoyancy and surface tension model buoyancy effects are significant in gas and liquid problems and cannot be ignored due to the large difference in density between the two phases ma et al 2018 li et al 2018 so the equation of gravity and buoyancy of the gas bubble is 8 f i v g ρ w ρ g g i where v g is the volume of the cells filling with gas phase g i is the gravity acceleration the velocity of gas decays rapidly underwater and the weber number we is less than 1 across the interface the surface tension of the gas bubble is functioned at the interface of the water medium which will result in an additional force on the concave fluid the surface tension is generally calculated by the continuum surface force csf model and the surface tension volume force term is added to the momentum equation 9 f csf σ κ α where σ is the surface tension coefficient κ is the interface curvature and α is the normal vector of the interface 3 5 discrete methods the finite volume method was adopted to solve the governing equations the well known simple pressure velocity coupling algorithm was used to resolve the momentum equation the discretisation of gradient in space was undertaken using a least squares cell based scheme and the body force weighted scheme was used in the pressure term the density and momentum term followed a second order upwind scheme and the phase volume fraction was reconstructed by the geo reconstruct method the time discretisation term was based on the first order implicit scheme all of the simulations were modeled using the commercial cfd computational fluid dynamics code ansys fluent 3 6 computational domain a two dimensional asymmetric model was established according to the size of vpwv as in fig 4 pressure inlet and outlet boundary conditions were established according to the experimental cases tested here the remaining boundary conditions were set to no slip walls the domain was initialised with the outlet pressure value the expansion ratio of the nozzle is ε 1 5625 so the pressure ratio for fully expanded conditions is p e p 0 0 1479 and the mach number at the nozzle outlet is 1 9 in our study the pressure of ambient water was set to 1 0 mpa 2 0 mpa or 3 0 mpa the stagnation pressure of the gas inlet was 6 7 mpa the nozzle pressure ratio npr was calculated for all cases npr was defined as the stagnation pressure divided by the ambient pressure p 0 p a according to one dimensional isentropic flow theory as applied to the nozzle npr1 for fully expanded flow is 6 7613 npr2 for normal shock at the nozzle exit is 1 6756 and npr3 for a wholly subsonic nozzle flow is 1 1221 table 1 the computational mesh is shown in fig 5 the mesh is refined in the nozzle area and the core area of the jet the total number of the mesh is 250 000 which is chosen under comprehensive evaluation of computing accuracy and economy in resources the mesh independent study is shown in fig 6 three kinds of meshes with different densities in the jet core area is calculated for comparison the mesh is refined while keeping the height of the first level from the wall unchanged and the total number of different meshes are about 180 000 250 000 and 500 000 the pressure ratio p p a in the axis line is plotted which shows the numerical results is independent with mesh 4 results and discussion 4 1 jet structures in water experimental results of submerged gaseous jet are shown in fig 7 where the water depth range is 100 300 m and the ambient pressure is 1 0 3 0 mpa numerical simulation results of jet structures in different water depths are illustrated in fig 8 due to large density gradient along the gas water interface and the presence of small bubbles near the liquid phase we choose a relatively moderate gas fraction to present the boundary of two phases the interface of two phases is plotted by iso volume of gas fraction α g of 0 7 which is also the dividing parameter of gas water interface used in reference of tang tang et al 2015 and zhao 2017 the transonic part from mach numbers 0 80 to 1 90 is highlighted in the gas part the penetrations of the gas injection from the nozzle outlet to the top of the gas boundary agree reasonably well with experimental results which verifies the accuracy of this model as shown in fig 9 as can be seen the whole structures of gas injection into water are similar at different water depths all of the jet structures contain a gas bag on the top and an inverted cone with unstable interfaces figs 7 and 8 a clear necking position in two parts can be observed in both experimental results and numerical solutions similar pinch off positions were also revealed elsewhere weiland 2013 shi et al 2010 tang et al 2010 harby 2014 the exhausted gas is continuously injected into the gas bag through the conical passages however the unsteady turbulent mixing of phases entrainment and the generation of small bubbles make the gas water interface in the conical part more indistinct and asymmetric with the development of fluid injection gaseous jets appear compressed under the high pressure environment with evidence of penetration of gas seen in fig 9 and an estimation of the gas coverage area in fig 7 the iso volume lines of the gas fraction fig 8 presented clearer evidence of the details of the process in terms of unsteadiness and mixing properties near the nozzle exit the gas was injected into still water by displacing the water around the nozzle exit and blowing a gas bag with the rising of the gas bag the conical gas passage was formed at a water depth of 100 m the nozzle is working in an over expanded state with oblique shock waves outside the nozzle exit similar to gaseous jets in air the bubble still contains the attenuating shock wave cells and supersonic gas flow decreases in speed to subsonic experiencing two or three velocity peaks en route clear expansion necking characteristics can be observed at 3 5 ms fig 7 a with the development of intensive turbulent mixing the regular expansion necking features have been covered by more complicated small gas bubble and turbulent structures the whole gas contour shows a conical shape at 200 300 m water depth unlike the one dimensional isentropic calculation result in air the appearance of the high back pressure pushes the shock wave into the nozzle exit or even backwards into the expansion section and the nozzle is operating under flow separation conditions the shock wave plane oscillates up and down along the nozzle s axis of rotation in the diverging part this anomalous working condition will result in extremely unstable flow of the motor and strong oscillations the simulation results confirmed that the shock cells structures wrapped in the gas phase outside the nozzle exit decayed rapidly as also happened in under expanded planar air jets in water according to the results of experimental studies by loth and faeth loth and faeth 1989 the gas water interfaces in the conical part show regular expansion necking in both experimental and numerical studies causing large scale unsteadiness and strong mixing effects this is considered to be a result of k h instability owing to the large density ratio of different phases and disturbance of velocity gradient kim and kim 2017 oertel 2010 this will be discussed further in section 4 5 4 2 nozzle in over expanded conditions when the pressure at the nozzle exit is equal to the ambient pressure the nozzle is in a fully expanded flow state with increasing ambient pressure the nozzle becomes over expanded three typical over expanded working conditions are listed in table 2 in over expanded state 1 oblique shock waves will be observed outside the nozzle as in table 2 a if the ambient pressure of the water continues to rise the oblique shock will become a normal shock wave located at the nozzle exit marked as state 2 further increases in ambient pressure cause the shock wave to be pushed back into the diverging section of the nozzle state 3 which will lead to an extremely unstable mode of working with unwanted separation of the boundary layer for gaseous jets working in deep water in the initial process of ignition the pressure in the combustor is still lower while the back pressure of the water is higher hence the nozzle is likely to be working in over expanded conditions in addition with the interaction between different phases the flow field is more complicated it can be found that all three levels of over expanded conditions occurred in gaseous jets underwater at a depth of 100 m the npr of the nozzle working condition is nearly in its as designed state and the flow field of the jets shows oscillations in state 1 and few oscillations in state 2 at a depth of 200 m the nozzle oscillates more in state 2 at a depth of 300 m shock waves move into the nozzle and oscillate in state 3 representative mach number contours at different water depths are shown in table 2 c 4 3 intermittent expansion necking phenomena in both experimental and numerical studies the intermittent periodic expansion features in the conical part just beyond the nozzle exit were observed as shown in fig 10 three expansion zones were formed the experimental results were grey scaled and colour filled according to the grey scaled pixel value as small bubbles generated along the interface and intricate turbulence effects arose the experimental gas water surfaces were more complicated the pressure contour shows that the pressure decreases in the expansion area and increases in the necking part especially in the flow field beyond the nozzle exit zone ⅱand ⅲ the distribution of mach number also changes simultaneously the intermittent expansion features cause the oscillation of back pressure near the nozzle exit and also lead to the over expanded working conditions of the nozzle in the area away from the nozzle exit zone ⅰ the pressure and speed of the gas jet have been attenuated and show little oscillation due to the limitations in these experimental observations it was difficult to capture the detailed wave structure in the gas core zone while cfd methods address this shortcoming which helps us understand the flow regimes around oscillations in the nozzle outlet area fig 11 shows the pressure oscillation and mach number contours over a certain time period 9 1 9 6 ms of a fully developed gas jet at a simulated depth of 100 m and the corresponding interface fluctuations were also plotted from the numerical results it can be found that the pressure changes with the interface fluctuations where in the shrinking part marked as a the pressure increases on the contrary in the bulging part marked as b the pressure decreases since the expansion and contraction instabilities of the interface appear alternately the pressure shows continuous fluctuations the changing pressure along the axis line at corresponding times is shown in fig 12 it can be found that the pressure distribution at different moments is not the same but all the pressure oscillations range from the nozzle exit y 0 065 m to 14 d e y 0 1 m with the bulging and necking of gas at the nozzle exit the pressure oscillation occurs with jetting time this pressure oscillation caused by bulging and necking at the interface also exists in studies of other two kinds of water depths 4 4 the effect of different working depths to assess the flow oscillation at the nozzle exit three monitoring points p1 p2 and p3 were established in the nozzle exit 5d e and 10d e from the nozzle exit wall fig 11 as can be seen from fig 13 fig 14 and fig 15 the pressure at the nozzle exit point and other two points in the plume area experienced different oscillations under different water depths pressure oscillation range of each monitoring point is listed in table 3 at a water depth of 100 m the gas is compressed by oblique shock waves out of the nozzle exit as the flow oscillates in state 1 mentioned above the pressure at p2 shows extremely high amplitude vibration ranging from 0 34 mpa to 2 40 mpa due to attenuation in the water surrounding plume the pressure oscillation at p3 ranges from 0 67 mpa to 1 78 mpa under these working conditions instabilities mainly exist near the nozzle outlet the pressure fluctuations at the nozzle exit underwent negligible oscillation except for the sharp peak at the beginning from the numerical results in fig 16 it can be found that the necking of interface out of the nozzle exit induces an increased back pressure and also pushes the shock wave into the diverging part of the nozzle which induces a sharp peak in the pressure at p1 as the water depth increases to 200 m the back pressure exceeds the pressure at nozzle exit so that it begins to influence the flow in the nozzle it can be seen that the pressure in the nozzle exit point p1 undergoes violent oscillations intermittently the pressure oscillation at p2 shows the similar intermittent characteristics at a water depth of 300 m the shock wave is pushed into the nozzle and the pressure oscillation at the nozzle exit is mainly affected by the jets outside the pressure at the nozzle exit p1 presented large amplitude oscillations for deep water gaseous jets with the same npr the working conditions at the nozzle are more susceptible to the water environment with increased water gas interaction the nozzle pressure oscillates and the whole flow field becomes extremely unstable compared with numerical simulation results it can be found that the instability of interface fluctuations is the main reason for the oscillations in the pressure field and these interactions even affect the normal working status of nozzle this abnormally high amplitude pressure pulsation was also observed by shi et al shi et al 2010 and jia et al jia et al 2015 but they did not provide an explanation thereof for the air to air jet with this nozzle expansion ratio npr 6 7 is close to the design state but in the water due to the influence of the interface the over expansion is more notable the shock wave may even be pushed into the nozzle expansion section which should be paid greater attention in the design of motors working in deep water the thrust of underwater solid rocket motor is the sum of the internal and external forces as illustrated in fig 17 however the water environment pressure p a at the front face of the engine is different from the back pressure p b at the back wall which will produce additional pressure thrust term in addition the back pressure at the back wall is affected by the air water interaction which show pressure oscillations therefore the thrust f of the underwater engine can be expressed as follow 10 f f i backwall p da frontwall p da where f i is the internal force the external forces is the forces on the back wall and front wall which is calculated through the integral of the pressure on the walls hence the forces on the nozzle exit back wall and the front wall under different water depths are calculated for comparison at different water depths the integral of the pressure on the nozzle exit wall is as shown in fig 18 the differences of force on the back and front walls were calculated fig 19 the forces on the back wall experienced large oscillations before becoming relatively steady however differences in force between front and back walls still oscillated in the axial direction the fast fourier transformations fft of the axial forces at different water depths are shown in fig 20 with increasing water depth the frequency increases and the amplitude of oscillations at depths of 100 m and 200 m are similar but those at a depth of 300 m show a much higher amplitude peak 4 5 gas liquid interface instability analysis for supersonic gaseous jets underwater the velocity gradient and density gradient in different phases provide the source of power for the observed instabilities which dominate the turbulent mixing at the gas liquid interface weiland 2013 oertel 2010 in the conical part the momentum of the gas dominates and the interfaces shows k h instabilities fig 21 when the high speed gas is expelled into still water large velocity gradient and density gradient are formed in the shearing layers the injection process is turbulent and unstable the interface in this part shows periodic expansion necking characteristics the gas is injected downstream accompanied with fluctuations of the interfaces initially the interface shows small bulging zones where the mach number of the gas is larger and then the interface is gradually deformed and curled with increasing entrainment small bubbles and droplets are also released around the interface and inside the gas resulting in a changing of air void fraction loth and faeth 1989 loth and faeth 1990 although decayed rapid decrease of velocity has been revealed in gaseous jets underwater shock wave containing external regions are still present similar to an air jet expelled into air in supersonic air jets expelled into water the shock wave cells out of the nozzle exit can be regarded as an unstable spatial temporal disturbing source which induced a series of interface evolution events atmakidis and kenig 2010 the energy is transferred from the gas to the water across the phase boundary the interfaces grow to form a bulging zone fig 22 from process a to d after that it curls and swallows droplets around it bringing it downstream as shown from e to h it can be observed that a new bulging part begin to take shape following the highlighted bulging fig 23 depicts streamlines of the flow field coupled with gas fraction contour from a to h it can be observed that a vortex appears along with the bulging of the interfaces at first a vortex is produced at the upstream side of the bulging part then upon gas filling the vortex is swallowed into the gas part and finally the gas is injected into the gas bag downstream and the vortex gradually dissipates causing a vortex in the outer layers 5 conclusion the characteristics of supersonic gaseous jets in deep water were studied the intermittent expansion necking phenomena out of the nozzle exit were found in both experimental and numerical results the mechanism of the flow oscillation and the interface instability were further explored it can be concluded that a the shape of the underwater gaseous jet in deep water is combined of a gas bag and a conical part the whole gas zone is compressed as the water depth increases for over expanded submerged gaseous jets the wake is extremely unstable and shows expansion necking oscillation characteristics b the design of motors for underwater propulsion is different from that of those working in air the oscillation of back pressure originating from the interface fluctuation will influence the normal working of such a nozzle which makes the nozzle work in over expanded working conditions in advance the periodic expansion of the interface will cause the oscillation of back pressure which leads to an extra unstable force on the back wall c the interface fluctuation is caused by the kelvin helmholtz instability which is driven by the velocity gradient in the gas core phases this instability originates from the nozzle exit and gradually develops to form large deformations of the interfaces then finally it will roll up the water droplet in the downstream direction moreover the breaking of expansion interfaces will generate large amounts of small gas bubble which

21628,supersonic gaseous jets with large ambient pressure are typically found in deep water propulsion systems the interactions between gas and water are turbulent and the plume exhibits unstable bubbly interfaces this work employed both experimental and numerical methods to obtain the flow structures of over expanded gaseous jets driven by different pressure ratios in water direct measurements of the interfacial behaviour of submerged gaseous jets with pressurised water were performed using high speed digital photography numerical simulations were also conducted to characterise flow structures by the interplay of inertia and buoyancy forces it was found that the interface of injection into water showed continuous fluctuations and strong mixing in the conical regions the intermittent expansion necking characteristics just beyond the nozzle exit induced the pressure oscillation of the flow field near the wall localised liquid water attack of the exit wall and aggravated the over expansion of nozzle working conditions these periodic phenomena were attributed to kelvin helmholtz k h instabilities driven by the large gradients of velocity and density in the

motor srm for a submerged vehicle is a supersonic turbulent gaseous jet expelled into a denser ambient liquid phase and this kind of gas injection into liquid is also encountered in metallurgical chemical and nuclear industrial applications hoefele and brimacombe 1979 labotz 1965 gulawani 2007 for deep water propulsion the effect of high pressure ambient water should be considered completely when the water depth is increased the nozzle pressure ratio stagnation pressure over ambient pressure p 0 p a of a fixed size nozzle will decrease so that the nozzle might be operated in over expanded conditions where the external water pressure might adversely affect nozzle performance and induce flow separation nguyen 2003 olson and lele 2013 ferguson 1969 compared with shallow water and air environments the aqueous phase with high pressure and large inertia will block the expansion of the gas an important characteristic of such injection into water is unsteadiness and its induced complex shearing effect in deep water the shearing interaction between two phases will be more intense as the gas phase will be compressed to a greater extent and the velocity boundary and phase boundary will interact with each other resulting in the fluctuation of interfaces and oscillation of the back pressure zhang et al 2018 because of the large velocity and density gradients present in different phases of such submerged gaseous jets the two phase interfaces are always unstable and non linear accompanied with fluctuations vortices and gas entrainment in different phases zhou and yu 2015 this is evident in engineering devices and is evinced by other experimental observations harby 2014 he et al 2015 miao 2016 however the underlying mechanism of flow field behaviour and the characteristics of such gaseous jets in deep water are still not well understood previous studies of submerged gaseous jets focus mainly on their working in under expanded conditions where the pressure ratio is relatively high and the pressure of the ambient water is low loth et al loth and faeth 1989 loth and faeth 1989 loth and faeth 1990 conducted experiments on the structure of planar under expanded air jets in a water filled open tank they found that the shock wave containing external expansion air jet core was maintained for some distance downstream of the passage exit until finally turbulent mixing and entrainment prevail which is much shorter thus faster decaying than air to air jets fronzeo et al fronzeo and kinzel 2016 also proved this difference by changing the ambient density from 1 kg m 3 to 1000 kg m 3 using compressible multiphase computational fluid dynamics cfd with turbulence resolving simulations shi et al shi et al 2010 shi et al 2010 conducted a series of experimental studies on the oscillation flow characteristics of submerged supersonic gaseous jets issuing from laval nozzles in a water tank they reported that oscillation of pressure with different frequencies occurred near the nozzle exit and they proposed that back attack in this region was a shock wave feedback phenomenon tang et al tang et al 2012 tang et al 2011 tang et al 2011 tang et al 2010 proposed four typical processes in morphological terms to illustrate the oscillation of the flow field using computational simulation they also used a finite time lyapunov exponent ftle field to identify the structures of multiphase flows and captured the interface vortex region arghode et al arghode 2008 arghode and gupta 2012 and wilson et al wilson 1992 designed experiments in submerged systems with normal temperature pressurised air and high temperature gas respectively using different nozzle exit cross sections they found that two phase instabilities downstream of the jet region were closely coupled with the pressure fluctuations in the gas chamber han et al han et al 2017 used experimental results from an underwater laboratory scale hybrid rocket to show more intensive instability of thrust compared with that in air in addition the pulsation decayed quickly underwater and the growth and collapse of the gas bubble causing the pressure pulse did likewise tang et al tang et al 2015 tang and li 2019 found that buoyancy effects can result in the momentum of force in submerged horizontal gas propulsion and the thrust showed different orders of oscillatory characteristics similar studies into the oscillation of flow near the nozzle exit were also addressed by gong et al gong et al 2017 qin et al qin 2016 liu et al liu et al 2015 and weiland et al weiland 2013 in their research the pinch off position was observed at different pressure ratios and different mass flow rates and the jets turned from the bubble regime to jetting regime with changes in gas flow rate research into gas injection in deeper water mostly focusses on water depths of less than 50 m jia et al jia et al 2015 undertook experiments in a pressurised water vessel to observe the plume of gaseous jets at a water depth of 10 m the solid propellant gas generator was adopted as the gas resources they used high speed cameras to capture the growth of the changing underwater ignition wake and the evolution thereof it was concluded that low amplitude oscillations accompanied with high amplitude events were fundamental to underwater wake flow from a solid rocket motor tang et al tang et al 2011 used a gas generator and an underwater testing system to investigate the growth and evolution of gas bubbles in supersonic gas jets at a water depth of 30 m the experimental results show that the growth and collapse of the gas bubble causes the pressure pulse and the pulsation can quickly decay under water ferguson 1969 conducted depth simulation in a horizontal pressure vessel using n2 he evaluated the lower and upper positions of the separation plane as a function of chamber pressure and ambient pressure from 0 1 mpa to 2 0 mpa all these studies of gas injection into liquid are mainly focused on plume observation and gross parameters such as penetration length no further hydrodynamic flow structures have been studied for underwater propulsion the oscillation of pressure in the wake flow could result in an additional force on the back wall of the vehicle and further changes the actual thrust delivered by the underwater working motor causing the trajectory of the vehicle to deviate from that designed previous research have shown that the interaction of gas and water is the main cause of oscillations in the wake zhang 2019 when the gas is ejected the high speed gas and the water environment form a shear layer and the shear layer is unstable which is also called kelvin helmholtz k h instability chawla chawla 1975a 1975b investigated the instability of the gas liquid interface of a sonic gas into the liquid pool using k h instability analysis he established a model describing the phenomenon of liquid entrainment resulting from the presence of k h instability at the gas liquid interface it was shown that the transfer of energy from the gas phase to the liquid layer predominantly governed the interface instability and the wave amplitude was a function of density ratio viscosity and so on chan et al chan 1994 also using the theory of k h instability to analyse the phenomena of non reacting and reacting sonic jets into liquid concluded that interfacial evaporation was found to enhance the instability while interfacial condensation reduced the instability weiland et al weiland 2013 investigated the relative importance of rayleigh taylor r t and kelvin helmholtz instabilities on the submerged gas jet boundary he adopted the instability mechanisms given by epstein epstein et al 2001 and found that r t effect is equally important as that of k h instability if an estimate of the axial velocity was used however the estimation is sensitive to the gas velocity used in the calculation in the shearing layer of such gas jets the gradient of velocity and density drives the k h instability mechanism here both experimental and computational methods were adopted in studying the flow patterns of a supersonic gaseous jet under large ambient pressure 1 0 3 0 mpa and the mechanism of unsteadiness near the nozzle exit a pressurised water vessel was used for simulating different water depth environments pressurised air was ejected into the water tank through a converging diverging nozzle by adjusting the pressure ratio the nozzle was working in over expanded condition given the complexities and difficulties inherent to the visualisation of such experiments especially for the wave structures of the gas in the core cfd simulation was employed to find the profiles of the flow field and to study large scale coherent oscillations of the interfaces the structure of this paper is as follows section 2 describes the detailed experimental apparatus and image processing technology the numerical analysis methodology involving the computational domain is presented in section 3 detailed results and discussion are presented in section 4 wherein the jet structures in experiments and cfd simulations are compared in section 4 1 the over expanded conditions in different pressure ratio states are described in section 4 2 the flow structures of intermittent expansion necking characteristics are depicted in section 4 3 the effect of oscillation out of the nozzle in different water depth is calculated as described in section 4 4 and the underlying mechanism driving k h instabilities of the interfaces is explained in section 4 5 2 experimental methods 2 1 experimental setup to construct a deep water environment a vertical pressure water vessel vpwv was designed as shown in fig 1 the size of the main cylinder part of the vpwv was 500 1000 mm and two operation windows two observation windows two lighting windows were installed at equal intervals around the water vessel two gas inlet outlet valves a water inlet valve and cable ports were installed on the top cover after filling the vessel with a certain depth of water the air inlet on the top can be inflated and pressurised to simulate a water depth of 100 300 m the laval nozzle was installed in the central post on the bottom fig 2 a non return valve and plugs were used to prevent the water from flowing back into the nozzle the expansion ratio of nozzle was 1 5625 with a designed mach number of 1 9 at the nozzle exit a schematic of the whole system of experimental apparatus is shown in fig 3 compressed air stored in a gas tank was used both as the source gas of the gas jet and as the source gas of inflating gas after installing the nozzle the test procedure was as follows first the vessel was filled with water from the water inlet on the top for a water depth of 1 m then the vessel was inflated from the gas inlet valve to ensure that the pressure of air within meets the required test conditions finally when the electromagnetic valve was open set as the time zero the gas with a total pressure of 6 7 mpa flows through the pipeline and nozzle into the still water a halogen lamp were put on the lighting window side for illuminating the jet a high speed camera phantom veo 410l was used to capture the flow structure of gaseous jets in water at a frame interval of 100 μs all the raw images recorded have a resolution of 300 300 pixels 2 2 image processing technology the raw images obtained from the high speed camera were processed to get quantitative information about the morphology of jets and gas water interface matlab coding was used to process the acquired images from each test firstly the rgb images were grey scaled and a high pass gaussian filter was applied to remove low frequency noise and improve contrast between the gas and the water medium then the images were adjusted in brightness and contrast and changed by phase reversal to make the background white for better observation the penetration of the gas were measured to make comparison with numerical results the statistical results of jet area were quantitatively studied through the capture of image pixels the image pixels of a single image is 154 352 pixels after image cropping the distribution of jet under different conditions is quantitatively studied by measuring the pixels in each part within the jet boundary 3 numerical simulation methodology 3 1 governing equations for supersonic gaseous jets underwater considering body forces such as gravity buoyancy and surface tension the governing equations are listed as follows ferziger and peric 1999 continuous conservation equation 1 ρ m t ρ m u i x i 0 momentum conservation equation 2 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j p x i y x j μ m u i x j u j x i f i f csf energy conservation equation 3 t k w g α k ρ k e k x j u j k w g α k ρ k e k p x j k eff t x j where p is the pressure t denotes the temperature u i u j are velocity components f i is the sum of the gravity and buoyancy forces f csf is the surface tension force and ϕ m represents the properties of the mixture which can be specified as density coefficient of viscosity and so on it can be written as ϕ m ϕ g α g ϕ w 1 α g subscript w denotes water and g gas k eff is the effective thermal conductivity k eff k t k k t is the turbulent thermal conductivity 3 2 vof multiphase model the vof multiphase model was used to trace the interfaces between different phases the model tracks two or more immiscible fluid interfaces by solving momentum equations and phase volume fraction equations it is widely used in the prediction of jet break up the motion of large bubbles in liquid and dam break problems in engineering for numerical study of gaseous jets in water the vof model has been validated tang et al 2011 tang et al 2015 the phase volume fraction conservation equation is 4 t α q ρ q α q ρ q v q s α q p 1 n m p q m q p where α q is volume fraction of phase q ρ q is the density of phase q v q is velocity of phase q s α q is the source item of phase q m p q is the mass flow rate from phase q to phase p and m q p is the converse transfer rate the phase volume fraction is constrained by the following requirement 5 q 1 n α q 1 here two phases are considered phase q is defined as water the density of which is 998 2 kg m 3 the dynamic viscosity is 1 003 10 3 pa s phase p is an ideal gas as governed by the equation of state p ρ r t the dynamic viscosity of gas is 1 7894 10 5 pa s both two phases have no additional generated sources and no mass transfer occurs between them i e the right hand of the phase volume fraction conservation equation is zero 3 3 turbulence model the shear stress transport sst k ω model was adopted to describe the turbulent flow which contains the turbulence kinetic energy k and the specific dissipation rate ω transport equation 6 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j γ k k x j g k y k s k 7 t ρ ω x i ρ ω u i x j γ ω ω x j g ω y ω d ω s ω where g k represents the production of turbulence kinetic energy g ω is the generation of ω γ k γ ω represent the effective diffusivity of k and ω respectively y k y ω represent the dissipation of k and ω due to turbulence d ω represents the cross diffusion term and s k and s ω are user defined source terms the standard k ω model and the transformed k ε model are both multiplied by a blending function designed to be one in the near wall region which activates the standard k ω model and zero away from the surface which activates the transformed k ε model 3 4 gravity buoyancy and surface tension model buoyancy effects are significant in gas and liquid problems and cannot be ignored due to the large difference in density between the two phases ma et al 2018 li et al 2018 so the equation of gravity and buoyancy of the gas bubble is 8 f i v g ρ w ρ g g i where v g is the volume of the cells filling with gas phase g i is the gravity acceleration the velocity of gas decays rapidly underwater and the weber number we is less than 1 across the interface the surface tension of the gas bubble is functioned at the interface of the water medium which will result in an additional force on the concave fluid the surface tension is generally calculated by the continuum surface force csf model and the surface tension volume force term is added to the momentum equation 9 f csf σ κ α where σ is the surface tension coefficient κ is the interface curvature and α is the normal vector of the interface 3 5 discrete methods the finite volume method was adopted to solve the governing equations the well known simple pressure velocity coupling algorithm was used to resolve the momentum equation the discretisation of gradient in space was undertaken using a least squares cell based scheme and the body force weighted scheme was used in the pressure term the density and momentum term followed a second order upwind scheme and the phase volume fraction was reconstructed by the geo reconstruct method the time discretisation term was based on the first order implicit scheme all of the simulations were modeled using the commercial cfd computational fluid dynamics code ansys fluent 3 6 computational domain a two dimensional asymmetric model was established according to the size of vpwv as in fig 4 pressure inlet and outlet boundary conditions were established according to the experimental cases tested here the remaining boundary conditions were set to no slip walls the domain was initialised with the outlet pressure value the expansion ratio of the nozzle is ε 1 5625 so the pressure ratio for fully expanded conditions is p e p 0 0 1479 and the mach number at the nozzle outlet is 1 9 in our study the pressure of ambient water was set to 1 0 mpa 2 0 mpa or 3 0 mpa the stagnation pressure of the gas inlet was 6 7 mpa the nozzle pressure ratio npr was calculated for all cases npr was defined as the stagnation pressure divided by the ambient pressure p 0 p a according to one dimensional isentropic flow theory as applied to the nozzle npr1 for fully expanded flow is 6 7613 npr2 for normal shock at the nozzle exit is 1 6756 and npr3 for a wholly subsonic nozzle flow is 1 1221 table 1 the computational mesh is shown in fig 5 the mesh is refined in the nozzle area and the core area of the jet the total number of the mesh is 250 000 which is chosen under comprehensive evaluation of computing accuracy and economy in resources the mesh independent study is shown in fig 6 three kinds of meshes with different densities in the jet core area is calculated for comparison the mesh is refined while keeping the height of the first level from the wall unchanged and the total number of different meshes are about 180 000 250 000 and 500 000 the pressure ratio p p a in the axis line is plotted which shows the numerical results is independent with mesh 4 results and discussion 4 1 jet structures in water experimental results of submerged gaseous jet are shown in fig 7 where the water depth range is 100 300 m and the ambient pressure is 1 0 3 0 mpa numerical simulation results of jet structures in different water depths are illustrated in fig 8 due to large density gradient along the gas water interface and the presence of small bubbles near the liquid phase we choose a relatively moderate gas fraction to present the boundary of two phases the interface of two phases is plotted by iso volume of gas fraction α g of 0 7 which is also the dividing parameter of gas water interface used in reference of tang tang et al 2015 and zhao 2017 the transonic part from mach numbers 0 80 to 1 90 is highlighted in the gas part the penetrations of the gas injection from the nozzle outlet to the top of the gas boundary agree reasonably well with experimental results which verifies the accuracy of this model as shown in fig 9 as can be seen the whole structures of gas injection into water are similar at different water depths all of the jet structures contain a gas bag on the top and an inverted cone with unstable interfaces figs 7 and 8 a clear necking position in two parts can be observed in both experimental results and numerical solutions similar pinch off positions were also revealed elsewhere weiland 2013 shi et al 2010 tang et al 2010 harby 2014 the exhausted gas is continuously injected into the gas bag through the conical passages however the unsteady turbulent mixing of phases entrainment and the generation of small bubbles make the gas water interface in the conical part more indistinct and asymmetric with the development of fluid injection gaseous jets appear compressed under the high pressure environment with evidence of penetration of gas seen in fig 9 and an estimation of the gas coverage area in fig 7 the iso volume lines of the gas fraction fig 8 presented clearer evidence of the details of the process in terms of unsteadiness and mixing properties near the nozzle exit the gas was injected into still water by displacing the water around the nozzle exit and blowing a gas bag with the rising of the gas bag the conical gas passage was formed at a water depth of 100 m the nozzle is working in an over expanded state with oblique shock waves outside the nozzle exit similar to gaseous jets in air the bubble still contains the attenuating shock wave cells and supersonic gas flow decreases in speed to subsonic experiencing two or three velocity peaks en route clear expansion necking characteristics can be observed at 3 5 ms fig 7 a with the development of intensive turbulent mixing the regular expansion necking features have been covered by more complicated small gas bubble and turbulent structures the whole gas contour shows a conical shape at 200 300 m water depth unlike the one dimensional isentropic calculation result in air the appearance of the high back pressure pushes the shock wave into the nozzle exit or even backwards into the expansion section and the nozzle is operating under flow separation conditions the shock wave plane oscillates up and down along the nozzle s axis of rotation in the diverging part this anomalous working condition will result in extremely unstable flow of the motor and strong oscillations the simulation results confirmed that the shock cells structures wrapped in the gas phase outside the nozzle exit decayed rapidly as also happened in under expanded planar air jets in water according to the results of experimental studies by loth and faeth loth and faeth 1989 the gas water interfaces in the conical part show regular expansion necking in both experimental and numerical studies causing large scale unsteadiness and strong mixing effects this is considered to be a result of k h instability owing to the large density ratio of different phases and disturbance of velocity gradient kim and kim 2017 oertel 2010 this will be discussed further in section 4 5 4 2 nozzle in over expanded conditions when the pressure at the nozzle exit is equal to the ambient pressure the nozzle is in a fully expanded flow state with increasing ambient pressure the nozzle becomes over expanded three typical over expanded working conditions are listed in table 2 in over expanded state 1 oblique shock waves will be observed outside the nozzle as in table 2 a if the ambient pressure of the water continues to rise the oblique shock will become a normal shock wave located at the nozzle exit marked as state 2 further increases in ambient pressure cause the shock wave to be pushed back into the diverging section of the nozzle state 3 which will lead to an extremely unstable mode of working with unwanted separation of the boundary layer for gaseous jets working in deep water in the initial process of ignition the pressure in the combustor is still lower while the back pressure of the water is higher hence the nozzle is likely to be working in over expanded conditions in addition with the interaction between different phases the flow field is more complicated it can be found that all three levels of over expanded conditions occurred in gaseous jets underwater at a depth of 100 m the npr of the nozzle working condition is nearly in its as designed state and the flow field of the jets shows oscillations in state 1 and few oscillations in state 2 at a depth of 200 m the nozzle oscillates more in state 2 at a depth of 300 m shock waves move into the nozzle and oscillate in state 3 representative mach number contours at different water depths are shown in table 2 c 4 3 intermittent expansion necking phenomena in both experimental and numerical studies the intermittent periodic expansion features in the conical part just beyond the nozzle exit were observed as shown in fig 10 three expansion zones were formed the experimental results were grey scaled and colour filled according to the grey scaled pixel value as small bubbles generated along the interface and intricate turbulence effects arose the experimental gas water surfaces were more complicated the pressure contour shows that the pressure decreases in the expansion area and increases in the necking part especially in the flow field beyond the nozzle exit zone ⅱand ⅲ the distribution of mach number also changes simultaneously the intermittent expansion features cause the oscillation of back pressure near the nozzle exit and also lead to the over expanded working conditions of the nozzle in the area away from the nozzle exit zone ⅰ the pressure and speed of the gas jet have been attenuated and show little oscillation due to the limitations in these experimental observations it was difficult to capture the detailed wave structure in the gas core zone while cfd methods address this shortcoming which helps us understand the flow regimes around oscillations in the nozzle outlet area fig 11 shows the pressure oscillation and mach number contours over a certain time period 9 1 9 6 ms of a fully developed gas jet at a simulated depth of 100 m and the corresponding interface fluctuations were also plotted from the numerical results it can be found that the pressure changes with the interface fluctuations where in the shrinking part marked as a the pressure increases on the contrary in the bulging part marked as b the pressure decreases since the expansion and contraction instabilities of the interface appear alternately the pressure shows continuous fluctuations the changing pressure along the axis line at corresponding times is shown in fig 12 it can be found that the pressure distribution at different moments is not the same but all the pressure oscillations range from the nozzle exit y 0 065 m to 14 d e y 0 1 m with the bulging and necking of gas at the nozzle exit the pressure oscillation occurs with jetting time this pressure oscillation caused by bulging and necking at the interface also exists in studies of other two kinds of water depths 4 4 the effect of different working depths to assess the flow oscillation at the nozzle exit three monitoring points p1 p2 and p3 were established in the nozzle exit 5d e and 10d e from the nozzle exit wall fig 11 as can be seen from fig 13 fig 14 and fig 15 the pressure at the nozzle exit point and other two points in the plume area experienced different oscillations under different water depths pressure oscillation range of each monitoring point is listed in table 3 at a water depth of 100 m the gas is compressed by oblique shock waves out of the nozzle exit as the flow oscillates in state 1 mentioned above the pressure at p2 shows extremely high amplitude vibration ranging from 0 34 mpa to 2 40 mpa due to attenuation in the water surrounding plume the pressure oscillation at p3 ranges from 0 67 mpa to 1 78 mpa under these working conditions instabilities mainly exist near the nozzle outlet the pressure fluctuations at the nozzle exit underwent negligible oscillation except for the sharp peak at the beginning from the numerical results in fig 16 it can be found that the necking of interface out of the nozzle exit induces an increased back pressure and also pushes the shock wave into the diverging part of the nozzle which induces a sharp peak in the pressure at p1 as the water depth increases to 200 m the back pressure exceeds the pressure at nozzle exit so that it begins to influence the flow in the nozzle it can be seen that the pressure in the nozzle exit point p1 undergoes violent oscillations intermittently the pressure oscillation at p2 shows the similar intermittent characteristics at a water depth of 300 m the shock wave is pushed into the nozzle and the pressure oscillation at the nozzle exit is mainly affected by the jets outside the pressure at the nozzle exit p1 presented large amplitude oscillations for deep water gaseous jets with the same npr the working conditions at the nozzle are more susceptible to the water environment with increased water gas interaction the nozzle pressure oscillates and the whole flow field becomes extremely unstable compared with numerical simulation results it can be found that the instability of interface fluctuations is the main reason for the oscillations in the pressure field and these interactions even affect the normal working status of nozzle this abnormally high amplitude pressure pulsation was also observed by shi et al shi et al 2010 and jia et al jia et al 2015 but they did not provide an explanation thereof for the air to air jet with this nozzle expansion ratio npr 6 7 is close to the design state but in the water due to the influence of the interface the over expansion is more notable the shock wave may even be pushed into the nozzle expansion section which should be paid greater attention in the design of motors working in deep water the thrust of underwater solid rocket motor is the sum of the internal and external forces as illustrated in fig 17 however the water environment pressure p a at the front face of the engine is different from the back pressure p b at the back wall which will produce additional pressure thrust term in addition the back pressure at the back wall is affected by the air water interaction which show pressure oscillations therefore the thrust f of the underwater engine can be expressed as follow 10 f f i backwall p da frontwall p da where f i is the internal force the external forces is the forces on the back wall and front wall which is calculated through the integral of the pressure on the walls hence the forces on the nozzle exit back wall and the front wall under different water depths are calculated for comparison at different water depths the integral of the pressure on the nozzle exit wall is as shown in fig 18 the differences of force on the back and front walls were calculated fig 19 the forces on the back wall experienced large oscillations before becoming relatively steady however differences in force between front and back walls still oscillated in the axial direction the fast fourier transformations fft of the axial forces at different water depths are shown in fig 20 with increasing water depth the frequency increases and the amplitude of oscillations at depths of 100 m and 200 m are similar but those at a depth of 300 m show a much higher amplitude peak 4 5 gas liquid interface instability analysis for supersonic gaseous jets underwater the velocity gradient and density gradient in different phases provide the source of power for the observed instabilities which dominate the turbulent mixing at the gas liquid interface weiland 2013 oertel 2010 in the conical part the momentum of the gas dominates and the interfaces shows k h instabilities fig 21 when the high speed gas is expelled into still water large velocity gradient and density gradient are formed in the shearing layers the injection process is turbulent and unstable the interface in this part shows periodic expansion necking characteristics the gas is injected downstream accompanied with fluctuations of the interfaces initially the interface shows small bulging zones where the mach number of the gas is larger and then the interface is gradually deformed and curled with increasing entrainment small bubbles and droplets are also released around the interface and inside the gas resulting in a changing of air void fraction loth and faeth 1989 loth and faeth 1990 although decayed rapid decrease of velocity has been revealed in gaseous jets underwater shock wave containing external regions are still present similar to an air jet expelled into air in supersonic air jets expelled into water the shock wave cells out of the nozzle exit can be regarded as an unstable spatial temporal disturbing source which induced a series of interface evolution events atmakidis and kenig 2010 the energy is transferred from the gas to the water across the phase boundary the interfaces grow to form a bulging zone fig 22 from process a to d after that it curls and swallows droplets around it bringing it downstream as shown from e to h it can be observed that a new bulging part begin to take shape following the highlighted bulging fig 23 depicts streamlines of the flow field coupled with gas fraction contour from a to h it can be observed that a vortex appears along with the bulging of the interfaces at first a vortex is produced at the upstream side of the bulging part then upon gas filling the vortex is swallowed into the gas part and finally the gas is injected into the gas bag downstream and the vortex gradually dissipates causing a vortex in the outer layers 5 conclusion the characteristics of supersonic gaseous jets in deep water were studied the intermittent expansion necking phenomena out of the nozzle exit were found in both experimental and numerical results the mechanism of the flow oscillation and the interface instability were further explored it can be concluded that a the shape of the underwater gaseous jet in deep water is combined of a gas bag and a conical part the whole gas zone is compressed as the water depth increases for over expanded submerged gaseous jets the wake is extremely unstable and shows expansion necking oscillation characteristics b the design of motors for underwater propulsion is different from that of those working in air the oscillation of back pressure originating from the interface fluctuation will influence the normal working of such a nozzle which makes the nozzle work in over expanded working conditions in advance the periodic expansion of the interface will cause the oscillation of back pressure which leads to an extra unstable force on the back wall c the interface fluctuation is caused by the kelvin helmholtz instability which is driven by the velocity gradient in the gas core phases this instability originates from the nozzle exit and gradually develops to form large deformations of the interfaces then finally it will roll up the water droplet in the downstream direction moreover the breaking of expansion interfaces will generate large amounts of small gas bubble which intensifies mixing in the flow field credit authorship contribution statement xiaoyuan zhang conceptualization investigation data curation writing original draft shipeng li methodology supervision

underwater vehicle auv has as many control inputs as the degrees of freedom dof that needs to be controlled so the auv can achieve hovering and attitude control at any position to complete accurate tasks due to considerations of cost weight and the tasks that need to be performed an auv is usually underactuated as the number of control inputs is less than dof to be controlled wang et al 2010 an underactuated auv is commonly designed to be streamlined equipped with a main thruster at the rear along with horizontal and vertical rudders and has features of strong coupling and high nonlinearity however this configuration has a low efficiency when the auv is manipulated at the minimal speed to solve this problem some researchers have put forward the vectored thrusters du et al 2018 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2018 vectored thruster redirects thrust for directional control of a vehicle which is opposed to using control surfaces to redirect the external flow nawrot 2012 vectored thruster was firstly used as a control mechanism on aircrafts in the first half of the 20th century anderson 1981 with the development of marine propulsors vectored thruster has been used on underactuated auvs for years jianguo wu et al 2018 designed a cruciform vector propulsion system for a streamlined auv four actuators were arranged in a shape as shown in fig 1 the heading change was achieved through the differential control of the actuators but the auv is still underactuated and there was a problem of maintenance of more thrusters and complicated control system among thrusters the same differential propulsion concept can also be seen in this patent mcbride and archibald 2003 tao liu et al 2019 presented a thrust vectoring ducted propeller based on 3sps s parallel manipulator as shown in fig 2 the tilt angles of ducted propeller in the auvs yaw and pitch plane were limited within 15 a control scheme of the vectored thruster was designed after considering the case study but the 3sps s parallel manipulator needs to occupy a lot of space inside the auv ba xin et al 2013 presented a similar parallel manipulator on waterjet propulsion the simulation results showed excellent performance of control system on vectored thruster xiaoxu du 2018 presented a deflectable duct propeller as shown in fig 3 lateral force will be generated by the tilted duct for controlling and motion simulation results showed better maneuverability than the traditional propeller rudder system but due to the relationship between two control inputs the pitch and yaw coupled motions in a certain quadrant direction may be hard to apply or at least there will be an obvious transition process for the base to rotate facing the problem of unnecessary excess of actuators space consuming and requirement of quick response in all directions a thrust vectoring concept is proposed in this paper four deflectors are installed inside the nozzle to redirect the outflow achieving thrust vectoring nonlinear six dof dynamic model is widely used for modeling and control of underwater vehicles the kinematic modeling in auv s dynamic systems is based on the newton euler method yan 2005 which divides the main force components into distinguished terms liang et al 2016 tian et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 it has a lot in common with the standard equations of motion for submarine feldman 1979 for the dynamic model of auv adjustments are made to consider the unique characteristics of deflectable duct propeller of du et al 2018 and two operating modes auv of tian et al 2012 results show that the model is satisfactory therefore the nonlinear six dof dynamic model of auv is used for the analysis of maneuverability of thrust vectoring ducted propeller with deflector computational fluid dynamic cfd method has been widely used on analyzing ducted propeller of auv since it is a low cost and reliable tool for predicting the hydrodynamic performance of ducted propeller numerically martio et al 2017 studied the virtual mass and damping coefficients of both open and ducted propeller which were determined using urans computations based on cfd method warn gyu park et al 2005 efficiently analyze a ducted propeller with rotor stator interaction by solving 3d incompressible rans equations on a rotating non orthogonal multi blocked grid de barros and dantas 2012 presented a study of cfd method applied to the prediction of normal force and moment coefficients of a myring type hull of an auv combined to a propeller duct from what have been mentioned above cfd method is suitable of predicting the performance of a ducted propeller accurately therefore the manoeuvring performance of the ducted propeller with deflector is evaluated by using cfd method in this paper the different motion control scenarios of auvs are typically classified as point stabilization trajectory tracking and path following fossen 2011 point stabilization is a special case where the desired position and attitude are chosen to be constant it is the most basic and critical motion control for the auv as an auv generally needs to be stabilized because of environment conditions and missions panagou and kyriakopoulos 2014 however precise point stabilization control of the auv is complex due to its coupled nonlinearities nonholonomic qualities generally underactuated nature and it usually accompanies disturbances arising from the external environment dong et al 2015 therefore in this paper by switching different reference positions and attitudes stabilizing response of the auv s motion can be studied to evaluate the maneuverability of the vectored thruster more than 90 of industrial controllers are implemented based on proportional integral derivative pid algorithms particularly at lowest levels desborough and miller 2002 since no other controllers match the simplicity clear functionality applicability and ease of use offered by the pid controller wang et al 1995 an integral separation pid controller was designed for the parallel manipulator xin et al 2013 to reduce the overshoot and eliminate the steady state error analysis of vectored thrust showed superiority and potential for steering of high speed auvs besides the pid is working pretty fine even only with pi or pd because every term is adjustable a single pi controller was designed for the necessary vertical force to be generated in the depth control of an auv malerba and indiveri 2014 the proposed solution was very simple in terms of realization and it was proven to be effective in simulation a novel pd controller was designed lv et al 2009 to compensate the coupling effects of auv simulation experiment results showed that the presented controller was feasible in application to auv a simplified pd controller was proposed yu et al 2016 in kinetics for the 3d trajectory tracking of auv numerical simulation results illustrated the satisfactory 3d tracking performance of the proposed pd controller therefore pid algorithms are chosen for the control of vectored thruster in this paper in this paper a thrust vectoring concept based on extendable deflector installed inside the nozzle of a ducted propeller is proposed a complete mathematical model describing the motion of a cylinder shaped auv equipped with the thrust vectoring ducted propeller is developed for motion simulation cfd method is used for acquiring the control forces and torques under different working conditions several motion control simulations are carried out using different control schemes and the maneuverability is evaluated based on the motion characteristics 2 mathematical model 2 1 geometric model in the present work the main idea is to achieve a deformation of the ducted propeller by extending a set of deflectors on the duct and to deflect the orientation of the high speed outflow inside the nozzle for thrust vectoring shown in fig 4 the jd7704 duct and the ka4 70 propeller are utilized as the basic ducted propeller the major parameters of jd7704 ka4 70 ducted propeller are illustrated in table 1 the duct diameter ratio duct length ratio tip clearance ratio and hub diameter ratio are defined as the ratio between the values and propeller diameter d the duct of deformed ducted propeller is shown in fig 5 since the duct has a larger volume relative to the blade the size of the deformation mechanism is more extensive and the structural strength can be improved to ensure the stability of the deflector as seen in fig 5 the spiral lifting rod and the shaft shell are used together as the transmission and the rotary motion is converted into the telescopic movement of the spiral lifting rod the translational motion of the shaft shell then controls a set of nested deflectors to reach a state of extension and retraction thereby varying the total area of the deflector the deflector relies on the strength of its own material rather than the force of the drive mechanism to resist the impact of the high speed outflow thus ensuring that the deformation can still work reliably under conditions of small driving force in this paper the model is simplified the ka4 70 jd7704 ducted propeller is still used as the basic ducted propeller but the specific deformation structure is neglected a rigid and constant thickness deflector is added on the inner wall of the duct to represent the thrust vectoring ducted propeller the specific setting is to install four deflectors in four orthogonal directions with a height of 1 56d a width of 1 92d and a thickness of 0 12d on the inner wall 0 48d away from the rear end of the duct relative to the diameter of the hub d as shown in fig 6 the control of the auv is achieved by changing the height of the deflectors in different directions 2 2 kinematic model and dynamic model vectored thruster requires the development of a propulsion control strategies that can change thrust orientation purposely tailored for the specific problem and takes care of the auv s motion along arbitrary space trajectories 2 2 1 reference frames two reference frames yan 2005 namely the body fixed reference frame ob xyz and the earth fixed reference frame oe xyz as shown in fig 7 are determined to describe the motion of auv with thrust vectoring ducted propeller defined as follow the ob xyz is fixed with the moving body of auv the origin lies on the center of buoyancy cob which is the geometric center of the auv axis ob x lies on the vertical axis directed onward at the front of the body transversal axis ob z points to the right side of the auv normal axis ob y is orthogonal to the ob x and ob z directing from bottom to top the oe xyz is located at the sea level the oe x axis and the oe z axis are in the horizontal plane while the oe y axis is in the opposite direction of the gravity 2 2 2 kinematic model to obtain the vehicle trajectory the motion is transferred to oe xyz by the local inertial driven etc or global sonar driven etc navigator computing the actual position this leads to the generalized position vector η x y z ϕ ψ θ t where x y and z denote the location of the cob in oe xyz and ϕ ψ and θ are defined as roll yaw and pitch angle respectively within ob xyz the nonlinear dynamics can refer to the rigid body euler s description making use of the velocity vector v v t ω t t where v u v w t specifies the surge sway and heave components and ω p q r t specifies the angular velocity components in ob xyz therefore the kinematic equation describing the geometrical relationship between the earth fixed coordinate frame and the body fixed coordinate frame and can be described as follows 1 η j η v where j η is defined as the transformation matrix to transform vectors from ob xyz to oe xyz and it can be formulated by a matrix which can be defined as follows 2 j η c e b 0 0 t e b where 3 c e b c o s θ c o s ψ s i n θ c o s ψ c o s ϕ s i n ψ s i n ϕ s i n θ c o s ψ s i n ϕ s i n ψ c o s ϕ s i n θ c o s θ c o s ϕ c o s θ s i

2 3 dynamic model there are several basic assumptions before building a proper model 1 the cylinder shaped auv is a rigid body and symmetric about the horizontal and vertical planes 2 the auv is fully immersed in water and in full wet state 3 the ob xyz is chosen to define the dynamic model 4 the hydrodynamic position and damping forces and torques meet the linearity assumption 5 the earth rotation and earth curvature are not considered the earth fixed coordinate frame is used as the inertial system with these assumptions the dynamic equations of motion of the cylinder shaped auv are defined yan 2005 based on the newton s and euler s equation as 5 a m λ v d a m λ d t v a v ω a m λ v a f m the a m λ and a v ω are defined as follows 6 a m λ m b m a m e 3 3 m r ˆ c m r ˆ c i λ 11 0 0 0 0 0 0 λ

angular velocity v ˆ is the skew symmetric matrix of velocity i v ˆ r ˆ c and ω ˆ can be formulated as i j x x 0 0 0 j y y 0 0 0 j z z v ˆ 0 w v w 0 u v u 0 r ˆ c 0 z c y c z c 0 x c y c x c 0 ω ˆ 0 r q r 0 p q p 0 when the auv is of constant mass or no mass change is considered during the voyage the term d a m λ d t v equals 0 besides the fluid dynamics are divided into ideal fluid forces and viscous fluid forces in this equation and for both the ideal fluid forces and the viscous fluid forces are considered in the position forces and damping forces mentioned below the added mass and munk moment caused by constant velocity translational motion should be removed so equation 5 can be simplified to 8 m b m a v ω ˆ 0 0 ω ˆ m b v a f m 2 3 forces and torques the forces and torques vector a f m is the sum of the forces and torques vector acting on the auv namely the gravitational and buoyancy forces f bg the hydrodynamic forces and torques f h and the ducted propeller forces and torques f p and the force and torque vector a f m can be defined as 9 a f m f b g f h f p 2 3 1 the gravitational and buoyancy forces a body fully immersed in a fluid undergoes the action of two forces weight and displacement applied to the cog and to the cob respectively these are also called restoring forces and torques thus this is defined as 10 f b g c e b 1 b g c e b 1 r ˆ c g where b 0 ρgv a 0 t is the buoyancy force vector of the auv ρ is the density of sea which was set as 1024 kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration which was set as 9 8 m s2 v a is the volume of auv g 0 mg 0 t represents the gravitational force of the auv 2 3 2 the hydrodynamic forces and torques the hydrodynamic forces and torques include hydrodynamic position forces and torques and damping forces and torques hydrodynamic position forces and torques occur when the vehicle moves underwater with a constant velocity and the hydrodynamic damping forces and torques are produced when the vehicle rotates with a constant angular velocity thus hydrodynamic forces and torques can be calculated with a linear approximation defined as 11 f h 1 2 ρ v s v c x v c y α α l c y r r v c z β β l c z q q v l m x β β l 2 m

of auv 3 cfd simulation the cfd method has been applied and the hydrodynamic forces coefficients are acquired for later motion simulation 3 1 governing equations the complex flow fields around the ducted propeller are obtained by solving the 3d incompressible navier stokes equations for the incompressible single phase newtonian turbulent flows the filtered mass and momentum equations are given by 13 u i x i 0 14 u i x i div u i u div ν g r a d u i 1 ρ p x i where u i is the fluid velocity ρ is the fluid density p is the fluid pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence models are used for turbulence closure in the present study sst k ω turbulence model was developed menter 1994 to effectively blend the robust and accurate formulation of the standard k ω model in the near wall region with the free stream independence of the standard k ε model in the far field it is now widely used in the numerical investigation of propeller performance and the results showed good agreement between the hydrodynamic variables obtained by the simulations and those of experiments available in the literature ge et al 2019 heydari and sadat hosseini 2020 zhang et al 2020 in the cfd analysis in order to calculate the force and torque coefficients of the ducted propeller with deflector we define advance coefficient j thrust coefficient k ti and torque coefficients k qi and propulsive efficiency η and they are defined as j v nd k ti f i ρn 2 d 4 k qi q i ρn 2 d 5 η j 2π k tx k qx i x y z where v is the inflow velocity to the entire domain f i q i are the thrust and torque in three directions of the ducted propeller calculated using cfd method 3 2 cfd grid and numerical setup the cfd simulation below is carried out using ansys cfx in order to simulate the internal and external flow fields of the ducted propeller a suitable computational domain is designed the computational domain shown as fig 8 is a cuboid with the long axis coaxial with the ducted propeller 14d in length and 6d in width and height with the propeller diameter d the inflow domain length is 4d and the length of the slipstream domain is 10d the inflow boundary is defined as velocity inlet the outflow boundary is defined as the pressure outlet of 0 pa the solid wall property is set as no slip wall the outer cuboid is set as the free slip wall to simulate the rotation of the propeller blades the entire flow field is divided into two computational domains the inner domain containing the blades and the outer computational domain the inner domain of the blades is a rotating domain where the rotating speed is the same as the rotation speed of the blades and the domain of the external flow field is static the multiple reference frame model which is a steady state approximation in which individual cell zones can be assigned different rotational speeds is used to set the rotation of the inner domain a proper grid division technique is of most importance to solve the rans equations accurately because the flow field in the duct is asymmetric due to the deflector based on the shape of the ducted propeller the multi block structured grid is generated with high quality for the external static domain using ansys icem and an unstructured grid that can better describe the blade shape is generated for the inner rotating domain an axial h shaped grid is generated around the inner domain a radial o shaped grid corresponds to the interface of the rotating domain refined prismatic grid is generated on the surface of the hub the duct and the blades to accurately simulate the low reynolds number boundary layer flows considering the complicated flow of the blade tip the blade tip clearance has a great influence on the hydrodynamic simulation of the propeller the refine zone is set on the grid around the blade tip clearance the grid details are shown in fig 9 in cfd numerical simulations the grid resolution has a great influence on the simulation results thus before the cfd simulation four different mesh resolutions are considered in order to get a rigorous evaluation of the numerical simulation accuracy in table 2 the different mesh resolutions comparison is reported according to the comparison numerical computations have been carried out with the 5 million grid for each case in order to investigate and characterize the global behavior of the propeller efficiently and accurately the rotational speed of the propeller has been kept fixed to a value of 450 rpm the advanced coefficient j is set to 0 55 where the ducted propeller has the highest efficiency the turbulence intensity is set to 5 the rans method is combined with the sst k ω turbulence model to simulate the steady flow field of the ducted propeller the finite volume method is used for the discretization of the control equation the first order euler post interpolation format is used for time dispersion the hybrid difference method is used for spatial dispersion and other variables are discretized in the second order upwind style and simplec algorithm is used platform mpi local parallel mode on multiple computational cores is used to increase the speed of iteration 3 3 forces and torques and flow fields for analyzing the influence of the deflector height h on the performance of the ducted propeller cfd simulations are carried out on the hydrodynamic forces coefficients with different height h only the deflector on the direction of positive y axis is considered to see the influence on the thrust force x axis lateral force y axis and vertical force z axis and torques along three axes shown in fig 10 the height h ranges from 0 mm to 65 mm with a 10 mm interval the thrust coefficient lateral force coefficient torque coefficient lateral torque coefficient and propulsive efficiency η with different height h are shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 with the increase of height of deflector h the thrust coefficient increases and then decreases and get the extreme point at the h of 25 mm the thrust coefficient at maximum h is slightly smaller than it does without a deflector which is advantageous because there is no sharp change in thrust the lateral force coefficient increases approximately linearly with the height h which is mainly the control force of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller and it is very close to the thrust at the maximum h the vertical force coefficient is always small when height changes as for the torque coefficient the x axis torque coefficient increases as h changes which means that the shaft power increases for thrust vectoring the z axis torque coefficient first decreases to negative value and then becomes positive and continues to increase thereafter the y axis torque coefficient is always small when height changes for vector thrusters that tilted the whole thruster xin et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 theoretically maximum lateral force is f x sin δ with deflection angle δ for comparison we define the lateral force ratio as the ratio of vectored lateral force to thrust without vectoring and thrust ratio as the ratio of vectored thrust to thrust without vectoring as shown in fig 12 at the maximum deflection angle 30 the ratio of ducted propeller with deflector is 0 47 which is very close to the tilted thruster with a lateral force ratio of 0 5 the thrust ratio of tilted thruster decreases as the deflection angle increases while the thrust of ducted propeller with deflector increases then decreases as the height increases for analyzing the flow field of thrust vectoring ducted propeller the velocity contours of different heights are compared shown in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 that when the height h 0 the high speed tail zone of the ducted propeller is symmetrical with the increase of h the symmetrical tail zone is gradually deflected generating lateral force besides resistance 4 motion simulation and maneuverability analysis based on the six degree of freedom kinematic and dynamic model developed the motion simulation and maneuverability analysis are carried out with a cylinder shaped auv equipped with the thrust vectoring ducted propeller firstly based on the cfd simulation of the ducted propeller an interpolation method is used to determine the fluid hydrodynamic forces coefficients in simulation with advance coefficient j and deflector height h the unsteady fluctuations of the hydrodynamic forces and torques are simplified and only the steady performance is considered secondly to close the kinematic and dynamic model hydrodynamic parameters of the cylinder shaped auv with ducted propeller are determined table 3 shows the parameters of the auv to show the maneuverability of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller the motion simulation consists of three different content pitch motions yaw motions and the pitch and yaw coupled three dimensional motions 4 1 pitch motions in the vertical plane the different motions in the vertical plane can be simulated by changing the height of deflectors in the vertical direction as seen in fig 11 that small vertical forces and torques are generated with the increasing of the height to simulating the pitch motions in the vertical plane the vertical forces and torques are neglected so the motions are exactly two dimensional the depth control and the pitch angle control of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller are performed in this section 4 1 1 depth control the depth of pitch motions is controlled by the pd depth control scheme the difference between real depth and reference depth act as a proportional term along with the pitch angle and pitch angle velocity act as derivative terms the reference depth is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 m above and below 50 m the reference depth and the depth control scheme can be described as 15 y r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 50 h k y y y r e f k θ θ k r r where fix is a rounding function which round towards zero t is the simulation time and set to 200s k y k θ and k r are the control coefficients of the pd depth control scheme which are set as k y 0 27 k θ 4 and k r 1 results of the space trajectory and deflector height are shown in fig 14 as we can see with a simple pd depth control scheme the auv can climb and dive to any depth with relatively small error and maintain depth until new commands are sent although it takes some time to get to the reference depth when the reference depth is changed the deflector height changes simultaneously which causes an increase in pitch angle with the depth approaching reference depth the deflector height changes in sign which means the deflector changes the direction to generate control force in the opposite direction to make sure the auv stops at the right depth when the depth is stable the pitch angle is zero but the deflector height is not zero this height is called balanced deflector height and it s expected to be relatively small to make sure it doesn t affect the control surface to work properly when depth is close to the reference depth the deflector height is not dropping to zero quickly which might because the interpolation at the smaller height is not precise due to the non linearity of the hydrodynamic coefficients compared to the depth control of auv with improved pd controller lv et al 2009 auv with fuzzy pd depth controller loc et al 2013 deflectable ducted propeller and propeller rudder with similar pd controller du et al 2018 respectively the depth control of ducted propeller with deflector shows minimum response time to change in depth and has lower overshoot even the change in depth is big 4 1 2 pitch angle control the pitch angle θ of pitch motions is also controlled by the pd depth control scheme the difference between auv θ and reference θ act as a proportional term along with the pitch angle velocity r act as a derivative term the reference θ is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 above and below 0 the reference θ and the pitch angle control scheme can be described as 16 θ r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 h k θ θ θ r e f k r r where fix is a rounding function which round towards zero t is the simulation time and set to 200s k θ and k r are the control coefficients of the pd depth control scheme which are set as k θ 4 and k r 4 results of the space trajectory and deflector height are shown in fig 15 as we can see with the simple pd depth control scheme the auv can sail along with a given pitch angle with small error and response time is shorter compared with depth control when the reference θ is changed the deflector height changes simultaneously which causes the increase in pitch angle but the fluctuation time of deflector height is less than it does in depth control that is because in pitch angle control the pitch angle doesn t need to recover to zero so the deflector height doesn t change in sign to pull back the pitch after climb and dive with different pitch angles the depth is slightly different that is because with the static error caused by pd control scheme the pitch angle is not exactly same with reference θ and the speed of auv is also slightly changed during climbing and diving when the pitch angle is stable a small height h is needed to maintain the course and at different pitch angle different height h is needed to balance the hydrodynamic position forces and torques the slow zeroing of height h caused by non linear interpolation at the smaller height can also be observed in pitch angle control compared to pitch angle control of auv with classical pd controller loc et al 2014 deflectable ducted propeller and propeller rudder with similar pd controller du et al 2018 respectively the pitch angle control of ducted propeller with deflector shows smaller static error shorter response time and smaller overshoot combined with the depth control effects above the ducted propeller with deflector shows good maneuverability in vertical plane 4 2 yaw motions in the horizontal plane the different motions in the horizontal plane can be simulated by changing the height of deflectors in the horizontal direction and the depth control introduced before are considered because yaw motions in the horizontal plane always come with the rolling motion of the cylinder shaped auv and this may cause the drop in depth but the vertical forces and torques generated by every deflector are still neglected the fixed deflector height and the yaw angle control of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller are performed in this section 4 2 1 fixed deflector height the height of deflector in the horizontal direction is fixed in this section to see the slewing performance of the auv three different heights are considered to compare the trajectory and there is no control scheme on the trajectory so the motion will be the natural dynamic response of auv with fixed deflector height the heights are set as 25 mm 45 mm 65 mm the simulation time is set to 200s simulation results are shown in fig 16 with the fixed deflector height the trajectory is almost a circle except for the start of the simulation as the deflector height increases more lateral forces are generated and makes the yaw angle ψ changing at a higher speed and makes the turning radius decreased with the depth control scheme the slewing yaw motion is on the same depth and the roll angle of the auv is small and increases slowly with deflector height which is the main factor of the coupling of yaw motion and pitch motion we define the ratio of turning radius to the length of auv as rt the ducted propeller with deflector has a turning radius of 28 23m with maximum deflector height and the rt is 10 12 it is smaller than the parallel vectored thruster of zhang et al 2016 with horizontal tilt angel of 15 we define the transverse stability margin g ω y as follow yan 2005 17 g ω y 1 m y β μ c z ω y c z β m y ω y μ x c where μ is the dimensionless mess defined as μ 2 m ρ s l g ω y is an indicator to judge the longitudinal stability of auv motion is statically stable when g ω y 1 dynamically stable when 0 g ω y 1 unstable when g ω y 0 the greater the transverse stability margin the greater the turning radius commonly g ω y is between 0 and 1 and the g ω y of auv used is 0 8 which makes auv steering more difficult causing the large ratio of turning radius to reduce the turning radius on the one hand auv can be redesigned to make the stability margin smaller and easier to control on the other hand the deflector can be optimized for more steering force because the size of the deflector is only a preliminary idea there is still room for improvement 4 2 2 yaw angle control the yaw angle ψ of yaw motions is also controlled by the pd depth control scheme the difference between auv ψ and reference ψ act as a proportional term along with the yaw angle velocity r act as derivative term the reference ψ is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 above and below 0 the reference ψ and the yaw angle control scheme can be described as 18 ψ r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 h k ψ ψ ψ r e f k q q where fix is a rounding function which round towards zero t is the simulation time and set to 200s k ψ and k q are the control coefficients of the pd depth control scheme which are set as k ψ 5 and k q 2 results of the space trajectory and deflector height are shown in fig 17 as we can see with the simple pd depth control scheme the auv can sail along with a given yaw angle with small error and response time is shorter and the fluctuation time of deflector height is less like the pitch angle control after motions with different yaw angle the z coordinates is not much different unlike the pitch angle control that is because the static error caused by pd control scheme is pretty small and the speed of auv is constant when the yaw angle is stable a small height h is needed to maintain the course and at different yaw angle different height h is needed to balance the hydrodynamic position forces and torques the slow zeroing of height h caused by non linear interpolation at the smaller height can also be observed in yaw angle control 4 3 pitch and yaw coupled three dimensional motions auv s pitch motion is coupled with yaw motion due to the roll motion which is generally solved by the roll control for the vectored thruster with deflector there is no other roll control except the restoring torque of the gravitational and buoyancy forces so the coupling of pitch and yaw motion is obvious besides the vectored thruster with deflector faces a problem of side forces shown in section 3 3 which makes the coupling more obvious in order to show the coupling between pitch and yaw motion and the influence on the motion the coupled motions are simulated to show the changes of the control input all the deflectors in the four directions and the following vertical forces and torques are all taken into consideration to simulate the pitch and yaw coupled three dimensional motions the depth control coupled with yaw angle control and the depth control coupled with fixed deflector height of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller are performed in this section 4 3 1 the depth control coupled with yaw angle control the reference depth is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 m above and below 50 m and the reference ψ is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 above and below 0 reference values and control schemes can be described as 19 y r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 50 ψ r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 h v e r t i c a l k y y y r e f k θ θ k r r h h o r i z o n t a l k ψ ψ ψ r e f k q q where fix is a rounding function which round towards zero t is the simulation time and set to 200s k y k θ k r k ψ and k q are the control coefficients of the pd depth control scheme which are set as k y 0 27 k θ 4 k r 1 k ψ 5 and k q 2 results of the space trajectory and deflector heights and roll pitch yaw angles are shown in fig 18 in fig 18 it can be seen that the reference depth and reference ψ are reached perfectly but the response time is longer than it does with separate control scheme the deflector height shows that depth control takes more time than yaw angle control so while depth changing the yaw angle is about to reach a steady state then vertical deflector height changes in sign to pull back the pitch which causes the horizontal deflector to act for a new convergence after approximately three times of coupling final steady state is reached in the steady state pitch angle θ is zero and yaw angle ψ is near reference ψ which indicates that the control scheme works pretty well the roll angle ϕ in the steady state is nearly 15 which means the roll motion is well controlled although it still has some influence on the attitude angle 4 3 2 the depth control coupled with fixed deflector height the reference depth is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 m above and below 50 m and the height of deflector in the horizontal direction is set as 21 mm reference values and control schemes can be described as 20 y r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 50 h v e r t i c a l k y y y r e f k θ θ k r r where fix is a rounding function which round towards zero t is the simulation time and set to 200s k y k θ and k r are the control coefficients of the pd depth control scheme which are set as k y 0 27 k θ 4 and k r 1 results of the space trajectory and deflector heights and roll pitch angles are shown in fig 19 in fig 19 it can be seen that the reference depth is reached perfectly but the response time is longer than it does with depth control scheme alone while depth changing the horizontal deflector is fixed but trajectory in the x z plane is not strictly a circle which is because with the fixed horizontal deflector disturbed yaw motions due to additional side forces and torques generated during depth changing are not well controlled in the steady state pitch angle θ is zero which indicates that the depth control scheme works pretty well with horizontal deflector fixed the roll angle ϕ in the steady state is slightly bigger than 15 compared with coupled motion control of auv petrich and stilwell 2011 santhakumar and asokan 2008 the coupling between pitch and yaw motions is not suppressed but within an acceptable range considering there is no extra roll control applied on the auv the pd controller of the ducted propeller with deflector is simple but effective the accurate motion control in both planes shows good maneuverability of the ducted propeller with deflector 5 conclusions in this paper a thrust vectoring ducted propeller with deflector is proposed first the geometric model of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller is designed and the model is slightly simplified to focus on the main issues then the six degree of freedom kinematic and dynamic model of an auv equipped with the thrust vectoring ducted propeller is developed based on newton s equation and euler s equation under reasonable assumptions the performance of the ducted propeller is evaluated by using cfd method and forces and torques are analyzed with the increase of height of deflector h the thrust coefficient increases and then decreases and there is no sharp change in thrust value the lateral force coefficient increases approximately linearly with the height h which is mainly the control force of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller and it is very close to the thrust at the maximum h the x axis torque coefficient increases as height changes which means that the shaft power increases for thrust vectoring then the maneuverability of the thrust vectoring auv is analyzed by carrying out a series of motion simulation including the pitch motions yaw motions and the pitch and yaw coupled three dimensional motions for the depth control the pitch angle control and yaw angle control the reference value is reached quickly and the steady state error is small the balanced deflector height is small which leaves more margin for control the slow zeroing of height h caused by non linear interpolation at the smaller height can also be observed for the pitch and yaw coupled three dimensional motions the reference values are reached precisely but it takes more time for the coupling of two direction s motion depth control takes more time than the yaw angle control so the yaw angle is influenced by depth control so the trajectory on the x z plane is affected and irregular roll angle ϕ is not controlled by control scheme but still not diverged and remained around 15 the results show that the thrust vectoring ducted propeller has a good maneuverability for the control of auv on three dimensional motions credit authorship contribution statement hui xia conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing peng wang project administration resources

underwater vehicle auv has as many control inputs as the degrees of freedom dof that needs to be controlled so the auv can achieve hovering and attitude control at any position to complete accurate tasks due to considerations of cost weight and the tasks that need to be performed an auv is usually underactuated as the number of control inputs is less than dof to be controlled wang et al 2010 an underactuated auv is commonly designed to be streamlined equipped with a main thruster at the rear along with horizontal and vertical rudders and has features of strong coupling and high nonlinearity however this configuration has a low efficiency when the auv is manipulated at the minimal speed to solve this problem some researchers have put forward the vectored thrusters du et al 2018 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2018 vectored thruster redirects thrust for directional control of a vehicle which is opposed to using control surfaces to redirect the external flow nawrot 2012 vectored thruster was firstly used as a control mechanism on aircrafts in the first half of the 20th century anderson 1981 with the development of marine propulsors vectored thruster has been used on underactuated auvs for years jianguo wu et al 2018 designed a cruciform vector propulsion system for a streamlined auv four actuators were arranged in a shape as shown in fig 1 the heading change was achieved through the differential control of the actuators but the auv is still underactuated and there was a problem of maintenance of more thrusters and complicated control system among thrusters the same differential propulsion concept can also be seen in this patent mcbride and archibald 2003 tao liu et al 2019 presented a thrust vectoring ducted propeller based on 3sps s parallel manipulator as shown in fig 2 the tilt angles of ducted propeller in the auvs yaw and pitch plane were limited within 15 a control scheme of the vectored thruster was designed after considering the case study but the 3sps s parallel manipulator needs to occupy a lot of space inside the auv ba xin et al 2013 presented a similar parallel manipulator on waterjet propulsion the simulation results showed excellent performance of control system on vectored thruster xiaoxu du 2018 presented a deflectable duct propeller as shown in fig 3 lateral force will be generated by the tilted duct for controlling and motion simulation results showed better maneuverability than the traditional propeller rudder system but due to the relationship between two control inputs the pitch and yaw coupled motions in a certain quadrant direction may be hard to apply or at least there will be an obvious transition process for the base to rotate facing the problem of unnecessary excess of actuators space consuming and requirement of quick response in all directions a thrust vectoring concept is proposed in this paper four deflectors are installed inside the nozzle to redirect the outflow achieving thrust vectoring nonlinear six dof dynamic model is widely used for modeling and control of underwater vehicles the kinematic modeling in auv s dynamic systems is based on the newton euler method yan 2005 which divides the main force components into distinguished terms liang et al 2016 tian et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 it has a lot in common with the standard equations of motion for submarine feldman 1979 for the dynamic model of auv adjustments are made to consider the unique characteristics of deflectable duct propeller of du et al 2018 and two operating modes auv of tian et al 2012 results show that the model is satisfactory therefore the nonlinear six dof dynamic model of auv is used for the analysis of maneuverability of thrust vectoring ducted propeller with deflector computational fluid dynamic cfd method has been widely used on analyzing ducted propeller of auv since it is a low cost and reliable tool for predicting the hydrodynamic performance of ducted propeller numerically martio et al 2017 studied the virtual mass and damping coefficients of both open and ducted propeller which were determined using urans computations based on cfd method warn gyu park et al 2005 efficiently analyze a ducted propeller with rotor stator interaction by solving 3d incompressible rans equations on a rotating non orthogonal multi blocked grid de barros and dantas 2012 presented a study of cfd method applied to the prediction of normal force and moment coefficients of a myring type hull of an auv combined to a propeller duct from what have been mentioned above cfd method is suitable of predicting the performance of a ducted propeller accurately therefore the manoeuvring performance of the ducted propeller with deflector is evaluated by using cfd method in this paper the different motion control scenarios of auvs are typically classified as point stabilization trajectory tracking and path following fossen 2011 point stabilization is a special case where the desired position and attitude are chosen to be constant it is the most basic and critical motion control for the auv as an auv generally needs to be stabilized because of environment conditions and missions panagou and kyriakopoulos 2014 however precise point stabilization control of the auv is complex due to its coupled nonlinearities nonholonomic qualities generally underactuated nature and it usually accompanies disturbances arising from the external environment dong et al 2015 therefore in this paper by switching different reference positions and attitudes stabilizing response of the auv s motion can be studied to evaluate the maneuverability of the vectored thruster more than 90 of industrial controllers are implemented based on proportional integral derivative pid algorithms particularly at lowest levels desborough and miller 2002 since no other controllers match the simplicity clear functionality applicability and ease of use offered by the pid controller wang et al 1995 an integral separation pid controller was designed for the parallel manipulator xin et al 2013 to reduce the overshoot and eliminate the steady state error analysis of vectored thrust showed superiority and potential for steering of high speed auvs besides the pid is working pretty fine even only with pi or pd because every term is adjustable a single pi controller was designed for the necessary vertical force to be generated in the depth control of an auv malerba and indiveri 2014 the proposed solution was very simple in terms of realization and it was proven to be effective in simulation a novel pd controller was designed lv et al 2009 to compensate the coupling effects of auv simulation experiment results showed that the presented controller was feasible in application to auv a simplified pd controller was proposed yu et al 2016 in kinetics for the 3d trajectory tracking of auv numerical simulation results illustrated the satisfactory 3d tracking performance of the proposed pd controller therefore pid algorithms are chosen for the control of vectored thruster in this paper in this paper a thrust vectoring concept based on extendable deflector installed inside the nozzle of a ducted propeller is proposed a complete mathematical model describing the motion of a cylinder shaped auv equipped with the thrust vectoring ducted propeller is developed for motion simulation cfd method is used for acquiring the control forces and torques under different working conditions several motion control simulations are carried out using different control schemes and the maneuverability is evaluated based on the motion characteristics 2 mathematical model 2 1 geometric model in the present work the main idea is to achieve a deformation of the ducted propeller by extending a set of deflectors on the duct and to deflect the orientation of the high speed outflow inside the nozzle for thrust vectoring shown in fig 4 the jd7704 duct and the ka4 70 propeller are utilized as the basic ducted propeller the major parameters of jd7704 ka4 70 ducted propeller are illustrated in table 1 the duct diameter ratio duct length ratio tip clearance ratio and hub diameter ratio are defined as the ratio between the values and propeller diameter d the duct of deformed ducted propeller is shown in fig 5 since the duct has a larger volume relative to the blade the size of the deformation mechanism is more extensive and the structural strength can be improved to ensure the stability of the deflector as seen in fig 5 the spiral lifting rod and the shaft shell are used together as the transmission and the rotary motion is converted into the telescopic movement of the spiral lifting rod the translational motion of the shaft shell then controls a set of nested deflectors to reach a state of extension and retraction thereby varying the total area of the deflector the deflector relies on the strength of its own material rather than the force of the drive mechanism to resist the impact of the high speed outflow thus ensuring that the deformation can still work reliably under conditions of small driving force in this paper the model is simplified the ka4 70 jd7704 ducted propeller is still used as the basic ducted propeller but the specific deformation structure is neglected a rigid and constant thickness deflector is added on the inner wall of the duct to represent the thrust vectoring ducted propeller the specific setting is to install four deflectors in four orthogonal directions with a height of 1 56d a width of 1 92d and a thickness of 0 12d on the inner wall 0 48d away from the rear end of the duct relative to the diameter of the hub d as shown in fig 6 the control of the auv is achieved by changing the height of the deflectors in different directions 2 2 kinematic model and dynamic model vectored thruster requires the development of a propulsion control strategies that can change thrust orientation purposely tailored for the specific problem and takes care of the auv s motion along arbitrary space trajectories 2 2 1 reference frames two reference frames yan 2005 namely the body fixed reference frame ob xyz and the earth fixed reference frame oe xyz as shown in fig 7 are determined to describe the motion of auv with thrust vectoring ducted propeller defined as follow the ob xyz is fixed with the moving body of auv the origin lies on the center of buoyancy cob which is the geometric center of the auv axis ob x lies on the vertical axis directed onward at the front of the body transversal axis ob z points to the right side of the auv normal axis ob y is orthogonal to the ob x and ob z directing from bottom to top the oe xyz is located at the sea level the oe x axis and the oe z axis are in the horizontal plane while the oe y axis is in the opposite direction of the gravity 2 2 2 kinematic model to obtain the vehicle trajectory the motion is transferred to oe xyz by the local inertial driven etc or global sonar driven etc navigator computing the actual position this leads to the generalized position vector η x y z ϕ ψ θ t where x y and z denote the location of the cob in oe xyz and ϕ ψ and θ are defined as roll yaw and pitch angle respectively within ob xyz the nonlinear dynamics can refer to the rigid body euler s description making use of the velocity vector v v t ω t t where v u v w t specifies the surge sway and heave components and ω p q r t specifies the angular velocity components in ob xyz therefore the kinematic equation describing the geometrical relationship between the earth fixed coordinate frame and the body fixed coordinate frame and can be described as follows 1 η j η v where j η is defined as the transformation matrix to transform vectors from ob xyz to oe xyz and it can be formulated by a matrix which can be defined as follows 2 j η c e b 0 0 t e b where 3 c e b c o s θ c o s ψ s i n θ c o s ψ c o s ϕ s i n ψ s i n ϕ s i n θ c o s ψ s i n ϕ s i n ψ c o s ϕ s i n θ c o s θ c o s ϕ c o s θ s i

2 3 dynamic model there are several basic assumptions before building a proper model 1 the cylinder shaped auv is a rigid body and symmetric about the horizontal and vertical planes 2 the auv is fully immersed in water and in full wet state 3 the ob xyz is chosen to define the dynamic model 4 the hydrodynamic position and damping forces and torques meet the linearity assumption 5 the earth rotation and earth curvature are not considered the earth fixed coordinate frame is used as the inertial system with these assumptions the dynamic equations of motion of the cylinder shaped auv are defined yan 2005 based on the newton s and euler s equation as 5 a m λ v d a m λ d t v a v ω a m λ v a f m the a m λ and a v ω are defined as follows 6 a m λ m b m a m e 3 3 m r ˆ c m r ˆ c i λ 11 0 0 0 0 0 0 λ

denotes the force and torque vector acting on the body m represents the mass of rigid body e 3 3 is the 3 by 3 identity matrix i represents the inertia matrix about the origin λ i j i 1 6 j 1 6 means the added mass coefficients r ˆ c represents the skew symmetric matrix of the center of gravity cog position with respect to the body frame r c x c y c z c t ω ˆ is the skew symmetric matrix of angular velocity v ˆ is the skew symmetric matrix of velocity i v ˆ r ˆ c and ω ˆ can be formulated as i j x x 0 0 0 j y y 0 0 0 j z z v ˆ 0 w v w 0 u v u 0 r ˆ c 0 z c y c z c 0 x c y c x c 0 ω ˆ 0 r q r 0 p q p 0 when the auv is of constant mass or no mass change is considered during the voyage the term d a m λ d t v equals 0 besides the fluid dynamics are divided into ideal fluid forces and viscous fluid forces in this equation and for both the ideal fluid forces and the viscous fluid forces are considered in the position forces and damping forces mentioned below the added mass and munk moment caused by constant velocity translational motion should be removed so equation 5 can be simplified to 8 m b m a v ω ˆ 0 0 ω ˆ m b v a f m 2 3 forces and torques the forces and torques vector a f m is the sum of the forces and torques vector acting on the auv namely the gravitational and buoyancy forces f bg the hydrodynamic forces and torques f h and the ducted propeller forces and torques f p and the force and torque vector a f m can be defined as 9 a f m f b g f h f p 2 3 1 the gravitational and buoyancy forces a body fully immersed in a fluid undergoes the action of two forces weight and displacement applied to the cog and to the cob respectively these are also called restoring forces and torques thus this is defined as 10 f b g c e b 1 b g c e b 1 r ˆ c g where b 0 ρgv a 0 t is the buoyancy force vector of the auv ρ is the density of sea which was set as 1024 kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration which was set as 9 8 m s2 v a is the volume of auv g 0 mg 0 t represents the gravitational force of the auv 2 3 2 the hydrodynamic forces and torques the hydrodynamic forces and torques include hydrodynamic position forces and torques and damping forces and torques hydrodynamic position forces and torques occur when the vehicle moves underwater with a constant velocity and the hydrodynamic damping forces and torques are produced when the vehicle rotates with a constant angular velocity thus hydrodynamic forces and torques can be calculated with a linear approximation defined as 11 f h 1 2 ρ v s v c x v c y α α l c y r r v c z β β l c z q q v l m x β β l 2 m

transport sst turbulence models are used for turbulence closure in the present study sst k ω turbulence model was developed menter 1994 to effectively blend the robust and accurate formulation of the standard k ω model in the near wall region with the free stream independence of the standard k ε model in the far field it is now widely used in the numerical investigation of propeller performance and the results showed good agreement between the hydrodynamic variables obtained by the simulations and those of experiments available in the literature ge et al 2019 heydari and sadat hosseini 2020 zhang et al 2020 in the cfd analysis in order to calculate the force and torque coefficients of the ducted propeller with deflector we define advance coefficient j thrust coefficient k ti and torque coefficients k qi and propulsive efficiency η and they are defined as j v nd k ti f i ρn 2 d 4 k qi q i ρn 2 d 5 η j 2π k tx k qx i x y z where v is the inflow velocity to the entire domain f i q i are the thrust and torque in three directions of the ducted propeller calculated using cfd method 3 2 cfd grid and numerical setup the cfd simulation below is carried out using ansys cfx in order to simulate the internal and external flow fields of the ducted propeller a suitable computational domain is designed the computational domain shown as fig 8 is a cuboid with the long axis coaxial with the ducted propeller 14d in length and 6d in width and height with the propeller diameter d the inflow domain length is 4d and the length of the slipstream domain is 10d the inflow boundary is defined as velocity inlet the outflow boundary is defined as the pressure outlet of 0 pa the solid wall property is set as no slip wall the outer cuboid is set as the free slip wall to simulate the rotation of the propeller blades the entire flow field is divided into two computational domains the inner domain containing the blades and the outer computational domain the inner domain of the blades is a rotating domain where the rotating speed is the same as the rotation speed of the blades and the domain of the external flow field is static the multiple reference frame model which is a steady state approximation in which individual cell zones can be assigned different rotational speeds is used to set the rotation of the inner domain a proper grid division technique is of most importance to solve the rans equations accurately because the flow field in the duct is asymmetric due to the deflector based on the shape of the ducted propeller the multi block structured grid is generated with high quality for the external static domain using ansys icem and an unstructured grid that can better describe the blade shape is generated for the inner rotating domain an axial h shaped grid is generated around the inner domain a radial o shaped grid corresponds to the interface of the rotating domain refined prismatic grid is generated on the surface of the hub the duct and the blades to accurately simulate the low reynolds number boundary layer flows considering the complicated flow of the blade tip the blade tip clearance has a great influence on the hydrodynamic simulation of the propeller the refine zone is set on the grid around the blade tip clearance the grid details are shown in fig 9 in cfd numerical simulations the grid resolution has a great influence on the simulation results thus before the cfd simulation four different mesh resolutions are considered in order to get a rigorous evaluation of the numerical simulation accuracy in table 2 the different mesh resolutions comparison is reported according to the comparison numerical computations have been carried out with the 5 million grid for each case in order to investigate and characterize the global behavior of the propeller efficiently and accurately the rotational speed of the propeller has been kept fixed to a value of 450 rpm the advanced coefficient j is set to 0 55 where the ducted propeller has the highest efficiency the turbulence intensity is set to 5 the rans method is combined with the sst k ω turbulence model to simulate the steady flow field of the ducted propeller the finite volume method is used for the discretization of the control equation the first order euler post interpolation format is used for time dispersion the hybrid difference method is used for spatial dispersion and other variables are discretized in the second order upwind style and simplec algorithm is used platform mpi local parallel mode on multiple computational cores is used to increase the speed of iteration 3 3 forces and torques and flow fields for analyzing the influence of the deflector height h on the performance of the ducted propeller cfd simulations are carried out on the hydrodynamic forces coefficients with different height h only the deflector on the direction of positive y axis is considered to see the influence on the thrust force x axis lateral force y axis and vertical force z axis and torques along three axes shown in fig 10 the height h ranges from 0 mm to 65 mm with a 10 mm interval the thrust coefficient lateral force coefficient torque coefficient lateral torque coefficient and propulsive efficiency η with different height h are shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 with the increase of height of deflector h the thrust coefficient increases and then decreases and get the extreme point at the h of 25 mm the thrust coefficient at maximum h is slightly smaller than it does without a deflector which is advantageous because there is no sharp change in thrust the lateral force coefficient increases approximately linearly with the height h which is mainly the control force of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller and it is very close to the thrust at the maximum h the vertical force coefficient is always small when height changes as for the torque coefficient the x axis torque coefficient increases as h changes which means that the shaft power increases for thrust vectoring the z axis torque coefficient first decreases to negative value and then becomes positive and continues to increase thereafter the y axis torque coefficient is always small when height changes for vector thrusters that tilted the whole thruster xin et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 theoretically maximum lateral force is f x sin δ with deflection angle δ for comparison we define the lateral force ratio as the ratio of vectored lateral force to thrust without vectoring and thrust ratio as the ratio of vectored thrust to thrust without vectoring as shown in fig 12 at the maximum deflection angle 30 the ratio of ducted propeller with deflector is 0 47 which is very close to the tilted thruster with a lateral force ratio of 0 5 the thrust ratio of tilted thruster decreases as the deflection angle increases while the thrust of ducted propeller with deflector increases then decreases as the height increases for analyzing the flow field of thrust vectoring ducted propeller the velocity contours of different heights are compared shown in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 that when the height h 0 the high speed tail zone of the ducted propeller is symmetrical with the increase of h the symmetrical tail zone is gradually deflected generating lateral force besides resistance 4 motion simulation and maneuverability analysis based on the six degree of freedom kinematic and dynamic model developed the motion simulation and maneuverability analysis are carried out with a cylinder shaped auv equipped with the thrust vectoring ducted propeller firstly based on the cfd simulation of the ducted propeller an interpolation method is used to determine the fluid hydrodynamic forces coefficients in simulation with advance coefficient j and deflector height h the unsteady fluctuations of the hydrodynamic forces and torques are simplified and only the steady performance is considered secondly to close the kinematic and dynamic model hydrodynamic parameters of the cylinder shaped auv with ducted propeller are determined table 3 shows the parameters of the auv to show the maneuverability of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller the motion simulation consists of three different content pitch motions yaw motions and the pitch and yaw coupled three dimensional motions 4 1 pitch motions in the vertical plane the different motions in the vertical plane can be simulated by changing the height of deflectors in the vertical direction as seen in fig 11 that small vertical forces and torques are generated with the increasing of the height to simulating the pitch motions in the vertical plane the vertical forces and torques are neglected so the motions are exactly two dimensional the depth control and the pitch angle control of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller are performed in this section 4 1 1 depth control the depth of pitch motions is controlled by the pd depth control scheme the difference between real depth and reference depth act as a proportional term along with the pitch angle and pitch angle velocity act as derivative terms the reference depth is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 m above and below 50 m the reference depth and the depth control scheme can be described as 15 y r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 50 h k y y y r e f k θ θ k r r where fix is a rounding function which round towards zero t is the simulation time and set to 200s k y k θ and k r are the control coefficients of the pd depth control scheme which are set as k y 0 27 k θ 4 and k r 1 results of the space trajectory and deflector height are shown in fig 14 as we can see with a simple pd depth control scheme the auv can climb and dive to any depth with relatively small error and maintain depth until new commands are sent although it takes some time to get to the reference depth when the reference depth is changed the deflector height changes simultaneously which causes an increase in pitch angle with the depth approaching reference depth the deflector height changes in sign which means the deflector changes the direction to generate control force in the opposite direction to make sure the auv stops at the right depth when the depth is stable the pitch angle is zero but the deflector height is not zero this height is called balanced deflector height and it s expected to be relatively small to make sure it doesn t affect the control surface to work properly when depth is close to the reference depth the deflector height is not dropping to zero quickly which might because the interpolation at the smaller height is not precise due to the non linearity of the hydrodynamic coefficients compared to the depth control of auv with improved pd controller lv et al 2009 auv with fuzzy pd depth controller loc et al 2013 deflectable ducted propeller and propeller rudder with similar pd controller du et al 2018 respectively the depth control of ducted propeller with deflector shows minimum response time to change in depth and has lower overshoot even the change in depth is big 4 1 2 pitch angle control the pitch angle θ of pitch motions is also controlled by the pd depth control scheme the difference between auv θ and reference θ act as a proportional term along with the pitch angle velocity r act as a derivative term the reference θ is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 above and below 0 the reference θ and the pitch angle control scheme can be described as 16 θ r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 h k θ θ θ r e f k r r where fix is a rounding function which round towards zero t is the simulation time and set to 200s k θ and k r are the control coefficients of the pd depth control scheme which are set as k θ 4 and k r 4 results of the space trajectory and deflector height are shown in fig 15 as we can see with the simple pd depth control scheme the auv can sail along with a given pitch angle with small error and response time is shorter compared with depth control when the reference θ is changed the deflector height changes simultaneously which causes the increase in pitch angle but the fluctuation time of deflector height is less than it does in depth control that is because in pitch angle control the pitch angle doesn t need to recover to zero so the deflector height doesn t change in sign to pull back the pitch after climb and dive with different pitch angles the depth is slightly different that is because with the static error caused by pd control scheme the pitch angle is not exactly same with reference θ and the speed of auv is also slightly changed during climbing and diving when the pitch angle is stable a small height h is needed to maintain the course and at different pitch angle different height h is needed to balance the hydrodynamic position forces and torques the slow zeroing of height h caused by non linear interpolation at the smaller height can also be observed in pitch angle control compared to pitch angle control of auv with classical pd controller loc et al 2014 deflectable ducted propeller and propeller rudder with similar pd controller du et al 2018 respectively the pitch angle control of ducted propeller with deflector shows smaller static error shorter response time and smaller overshoot combined with the depth control effects above the ducted propeller with deflector shows good maneuverability in vertical plane 4 2 yaw motions in the horizontal plane the different motions in the horizontal plane can be simulated by changing the height of deflectors in the horizontal direction and the depth control introduced before are considered because yaw motions in the horizontal plane always come with the rolling motion of the cylinder shaped auv and this may cause the drop in depth but the vertical forces and torques generated by every deflector are still neglected the fixed deflector height and the yaw angle control of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller are performed in this section 4 2 1 fixed deflector height the height of deflector in the horizontal direction is fixed in this section to see the slewing performance of the auv three different heights are considered to compare the trajectory and there is no control scheme on the trajectory so the motion will be the natural dynamic response of auv with fixed deflector height the heights are set as 25 mm 45 mm 65 mm the simulation time is set to 200s simulation results are shown in fig 16 with the fixed deflector height the trajectory is almost a circle except for the start of the simulation as the deflector height increases more lateral forces are generated and makes the yaw angle ψ changing at a higher speed and makes the turning radius decreased with the depth control scheme the slewing yaw motion is on the same depth and the roll angle of the auv is small and increases slowly with deflector height which is the main factor of the coupling of yaw motion and pitch motion we define the ratio of turning radius to the length of auv as rt the ducted propeller with deflector has a turning radius of 28 23m with maximum deflector height and the rt is 10 12 it is smaller than the parallel vectored thruster of zhang et al 2016 with horizontal tilt angel of 15 we define the transverse stability margin g ω y as follow yan 2005 17 g ω y 1 m y β μ c z ω y c z β m y ω y μ x c where μ is the dimensionless mess defined as μ 2 m ρ s l g ω y is an indicator to judge the longitudinal stability of auv motion is statically stable when g ω y 1 dynamically stable when 0 g ω y 1 unstable when g ω y 0 the greater the transverse stability margin the greater the turning radius commonly g ω y is between 0 and 1 and the g ω y of auv used is 0 8 which makes auv steering more difficult causing the large ratio of turning radius to reduce the turning radius on the one hand auv can be redesigned to make the stability margin smaller and easier to control on the other hand the deflector can be optimized for more steering force because the size of the deflector is only a preliminary idea there is still room for improvement 4 2 2 yaw angle control the yaw angle ψ of yaw motions is also controlled by the pd depth control scheme the difference between auv ψ and reference ψ act as a proportional term along with the yaw angle velocity r act as derivative term the reference ψ is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 above and below 0 the reference ψ and the yaw angle control scheme can be described as 18 ψ r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 h k ψ ψ ψ r e f k q q where fix is a rounding function which round towards zero t is the simulation time and set to 200s k ψ and k q are the control coefficients of the pd depth control scheme which are set as k ψ 5 and k q 2 results of the space trajectory and deflector height are shown in fig 17 as we can see with the simple pd depth control scheme the auv can sail along with a given yaw angle with small error and response time is shorter and the fluctuation time of deflector height is less like the pitch angle control after motions with different yaw angle the z coordinates is not much different unlike the pitch angle control that is because the static error caused by pd control scheme is pretty small and the speed of auv is constant when the yaw angle is stable a small height h is needed to maintain the course and at different yaw angle different height h is needed to balance the hydrodynamic position forces and torques the slow zeroing of height h caused by non linear interpolation at the smaller height can also be observed in yaw angle control 4 3 pitch and yaw coupled three dimensional motions auv s pitch motion is coupled with yaw motion due to the roll motion which is generally solved by the roll control for the vectored thruster with deflector there is no other roll control except the restoring torque of the gravitational and buoyancy forces so the coupling of pitch and yaw motion is obvious besides the vectored thruster with deflector faces a problem of side forces shown in section 3 3 which makes the coupling more obvious in order to show the coupling between pitch and yaw motion and the influence on the motion the coupled motions are simulated to show the changes of the control input all the deflectors in the four directions and the following vertical forces and torques are all taken into consideration to simulate the pitch and yaw coupled three dimensional motions the depth control coupled with yaw angle control and the depth control coupled with fixed deflector height of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller are performed in this section 4 3 1 the depth control coupled with yaw angle control the reference depth is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 m above and below 50 m and the reference ψ is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 above and below 0 reference values and control schemes can be described as 19 y r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 50 ψ r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 h v e r t i c a l k y y y r e f k θ θ k r r h h o r i z o n t a l k ψ ψ ψ r e f k q q where fix is a rounding function which round towards zero t is the simulation time and set to 200s k y k θ k r k ψ and k q are the control coefficients of the pd depth control scheme which are set as k y 0 27 k θ 4 k r 1 k ψ 5 and k q 2 results of the space trajectory and deflector heights and roll pitch yaw angles are shown in fig 18 in fig 18 it can be seen that the reference depth and reference ψ are reached perfectly but the response time is longer than it does with separate control scheme the deflector height shows that depth control takes more time than yaw angle control so while depth changing the yaw angle is about to reach a steady state then vertical deflector height changes in sign to pull back the pitch which causes the horizontal deflector to act for a new convergence after approximately three times of coupling final steady state is reached in the steady state pitch angle θ is zero and yaw angle ψ is near reference ψ which indicates that the control scheme works pretty well the roll angle ϕ in the steady state is nearly 15 which means the roll motion is well controlled although it still has some influence on the attitude angle 4 3 2 the depth control coupled with fixed deflector height the reference depth is set to fluctuate within a range of 5 m above and below 50 m and the height of deflector in the horizontal direction is set as 21 mm reference values and control schemes can be described as 20 y r e f 5 1 f i x t 50 50 h v e r t i c a l k y y y r e f k θ θ k r r where fix is a rounding function which round towards zero t is the simulation time and set to 200s k y k θ and k r are the control coefficients of the pd depth control scheme which are set as k y 0 27 k θ 4 and k r 1 results of the space trajectory and deflector heights and roll pitch angles are shown in fig 19 in fig 19 it can be seen that the reference depth is reached perfectly but the response time is longer than it does with depth control scheme alone while depth changing the horizontal deflector is fixed but trajectory in the x z plane is not strictly a circle which is because with the fixed horizontal deflector disturbed yaw motions due to additional side forces and torques generated during depth changing are not well controlled in the steady state pitch angle θ is zero which indicates that the depth control scheme works pretty well with horizontal deflector fixed the roll angle ϕ in the steady state is slightly bigger than 15 compared with coupled motion control of auv petrich and stilwell 2011 santhakumar and asokan 2008 the coupling between pitch and yaw motions is not suppressed but within an acceptable range considering there is no extra roll control applied on the auv the pd controller of the ducted propeller with deflector is simple but effective the accurate motion control in both planes shows good maneuverability of the ducted propeller with deflector 5 conclusions in this paper a thrust vectoring ducted propeller with deflector is proposed first the geometric model of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller is designed and the model is slightly simplified to focus on the main issues then the six degree of freedom kinematic and dynamic model of an auv equipped with the thrust vectoring ducted propeller is developed based on newton s equation and euler s equation under reasonable assumptions the performance of the ducted propeller is evaluated by using cfd method and forces and torques are analyzed with the increase of height of deflector h the thrust coefficient increases and then decreases and there is no sharp change in thrust value the lateral force coefficient increases approximately linearly with the height h which is mainly the control force of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller and it is very close to the thrust at the maximum h the x axis torque coefficient increases as height changes which means that the shaft power increases for thrust vectoring then the maneuverability of the thrust vectoring auv is analyzed by carrying out a series of motion simulation including the pitch motions yaw motions and the pitch and yaw coupled three dimensional motions for the depth control the pitch angle control and yaw angle control the reference value is reached quickly and the steady state error is small the balanced deflector height is small which leaves more margin for control the slow zeroing of height h caused by non linear interpolation at the smaller height can also be observed for the pitch and yaw coupled three dimensional motions the reference values are reached precisely but it takes more time for the coupling of two direction s motion depth control takes more time than the yaw angle control so the yaw angle is influenced by depth control so the trajectory on the x z plane is affected and irregular roll angle ϕ is not controlled by control scheme but still not diverged and remained around 15 the results show that the thrust vectoring ducted propeller has a good maneuverability for the control of auv on three dimensional motions credit authorship contribution statement hui xia conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing peng wang project administration resources
