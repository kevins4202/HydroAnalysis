10705,as the second carbon storage pool soil is easily influenced by human activities mulched drip irrigation is a water saving irrigation technique used widely in arid and semi arid regions however information about the response of co2 exchange to mulched drip irrigation such as the wetter and warmer soil is limited to identify the carbon emissions effects of mulched drip irrigation we carried out a field experiment using drip irrigation with and without clear plastic mulching during the cotton growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 we monitored the temporal and spatial variation of soil moisture soil temperature cotton growth stage biomass lint yield co2 emissions and the relationship between soil respiration rate and soil climate the results showed that plastic mulching drip irrigation increased soil moisture and soil temperature especially during the early and middle growth stages of cotton the soil respiration rate was related positively to the higher soil temperature and moisture conditions promoted by plastic film mulching although the coefficients of determination were low r2 were 0 480 and 0 205 corresponding p value was both 0 000 respectively the highest value of soil respiration was obtained within the narrow rows under the drip tape regardless of the practice of mulching or not the soil respiration rate under plastic mulch in the narrow and wide rows were on average 28 35 and 22 48 higher than non mulched control meanwhile the amount of total co2 emissions was significantly increased by 25 34 and 28 90 in these same rows respectively p values were 0 006 at narrow rows and 0 010 at wide rows in the first year and 0 000 at same rows in the second year the differences of co2 emission in the bare soil was not significant between mulched plots and non mulched control p values were 0 757 and 0 918 in the first and second growing seasons respectively in addition plastic mulching significantly improved the biomass and yield of cotton by 61 49 and 12 83 on average p values were 0 034 and 0 039 in 2015 0 024 and 0 032 in 2016 respectively the results indicate that the application of drip irrigation under plastic mulch could increase soil water

indicated that plastic film mulching practices signiﬁcantly increased co2 concentrations at 0 40 cm soil depths and enhanced the cumulative carbon dioxide emissions by 8 meanwhile guo et al 2017 discovered that drip irrigation could effectively promote crop root rs and that cumulative co2 emissions were larger under drip irrigation than under flood irrigation to date though few researchers have studied co2 emissions with the field use of pmd especially in arid regions that have low soil organic carbon similarly information on the temporal and spatial variation of soil respiration under

determine the effects of pmd on soil carbon emissions temporal and spatial changes in soil respiration and the relationships between soil respiration and soil climate soil temperature and moisture we hypothesize that rs will be greater with pmd because of the heterogeneity of water application and the increase in soil temperature in the rhizosphere clarifying the distribution of rs and quantifying the co2 efflux with plastic ﬁlm mulch is challenging but critical to accomplish this we compared the soil moisture soil temperature soil respiration co2 emissions between with and without clear plastic mulching using drip irrigation and analyzed the relationship among soil respiration rate with soil climates 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site we conducted a field trial in 2015 2016 at the key laboratory of modern water saving irrigation of the xinjiang production and construction corps at shihezi university in xinjiang china 85 59 e 44 19 n 412 m a s l fig 1 the region

free period lasting 170 days the cumulative temperature days exceeding 10 c and 15 c were 3463 5 c days and 2 960 0 c days respectively time series plots of precipitation and air temperature during the growing seasons april november of 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 2 while cotton was growing the total precipitation and average air temperature were 31 7 mm and 20 3 c in the first year and 157 4

1 the total soil nitrogen was 0 80 g kg 1 the available soil phosphorus was 0 94 g kg 1 and the available potassium was 0 42 g kg 1 prior to the experimental period cotton was planted at the study site in 2008 2014 2 2 experimental design this experiment compared the results of a control treatment drip irrigation with no mulch nmd with an experimental treatment drip irrigation under plastic mulch pmd each treatment was conducted in triplicate for a total of six field plots each of which was 20 m long and 3 m wide a local cotton cultivar cv xinluzao 22 was planted at a seeding rate of 250 000 plants ha 1 on april 27 2015 and april 21 2016 respectively four rows of cotton were sown under each 145 cm wide strip of plastic film with the color being transparent in this study with 60 cm of bare soil between each strip fig 3 the rows were paired with 20 cm between paired rows narrow row and 45 cm between non paired rows wide row a single wing labyrinth drip tape with emitters every 0 3 m ran down the middle of each narrow row no plastic film was applied in the control group but all other cultivation patterns were the same as the pmd treatment other field management decisions were based on the practices used in local cotton fields nitrogen fertilizer urea and phosphorus fertilizer potassium ammonium phosphate were applied with irrigation to each treatment the details of irrigation and fertilization are shown in table 1 the water pressure in each lateral was 0 06 mpa regulated by pressure gauges and sluice valves installed at the front end of the water supply pipe and the rate of discharge for a single emitter from the drip tape was approximately 1 2 l h 1 all plots received the same quota of irrigation in each year cotton was harvested two times each year during harvest 1 4 m2 samples of cotton were collected manually from the center of each plot and the other ten plants were collected randomly from each plot in order to represent the average growth for biomass measurements 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 soil co2 emission a li 8100 infrared gas analyzer li cor ltd usa was used to measure the co2 flux from the field soils the instrument consisted of a pvc collar with a diameter of 11 5 cm and a height of 13 5 cm the collar was inserted 10 cm into the soil at three locations in the middle of each plot in wide rows wr narrow rows nr and bare soil bs between film strips as shown in fig 3c measurements of rs were collected twice per month during the cotton growth period and each test was conducted twice between 9 00 a m and 11 00 a m local time each measurement took 2 3 min prior to measurements plants living inside the pvc collars were removed to eliminate the effects of aboveground respiration to avoid the interference of rainfall events and irrigation on rs measurements were conducted at least three days after irrigation or precipitation seasonal cumulative co2 emissions during cotton growth period were sequentially calculated as follows singh et al 1999 s e a s o n a l c o 2 e m i s s i o n s i n r i d i where ri is the rate of co2 flux in the ith sampling interval di is the duration of the ith sampling interval in days and n is the sampling number 2 3 2 soil temperatures and soil moisture while soil respiration was being measured soil temperature and moisture were recorded using the li 8100 system soil temperature was measured with rt 1 sensors meter group inc usa at a depth of 5 cm and measurements of soil volumetric water content were gathered with ec 5 soil moisture sensors meter group inc usa at a depth of 10 cm addition soil temperature data were recorded at depths of 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm in each treatment using alcohol thermometers hongxing instruments factory hebei province china at the same time soil samples were collected at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 100 cm and massed before and after being oven dried to determine the gravimetric water content distribution in the soil profile g g 1 the volumetric water content was calculated by gravimetric water content multiplied to the soil bulk density 2 3 3 calculation in accordance with previous measurements of soil temperature and soil co2 efflux the temperature sensitivity of rs was calculated as luan et al 2011 rs ae bt where rs is the soil respiration μmol m 2 s 1 t is the soil temperature measured at 5 cm depth a is the basal rs rate μmol m 2 s 1 and b is a q10 constant calculated as fang et al 2017 q10 e 10b the relationship between volumetric soil water content θ and the soil respiration rate was described by cheng et al 2015 as rs b1 b2θ where b1 and b2 are model parameters 2 4 data analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss 20 0 ibm spss statistics usa a kolmogorov smirnov test was used to determine the frequency distributions of the dependent and independent variables p 0 05 measurement data were analyzed using the one way analysis of variance anova tests the differences among mean values obtained from each treatment were determined using least significant difference tests at a level of α 0 05 the correlations that soil co2 emissions exhibited with soil temperature and soil moisture were determined by calculating pearson correlation coefficients 3 results 3 1 soil climate and cotton lint yield soil climate in the soil profiles at our study site varied over the growth seasons fig 4 and table 3 during the squaring stage prior to irrigation soil moisture was significantly lower 31 74 on average p values were 0 012 and 0 027 in 2015 and 2016 respectively in nmd treatment than in pmd treatment at 0 40 cm depths fig 4a b meanwhile soil temperature was higher 4 12 at 0 15 cm depth in the pmd treatment than in the npm treatment during irrigation the soil water content changed throughout the cotton root zone fig 4c d while soil moisture remained low in wr and bs after the irrigation period i e during the boll opening stage soil moisture in the pmd treatment was similar to the nmd treatment fig 4e f while soil temperature was higher under mulching the changes in soil temperature 5 cm depth and moisture 10 cm depth over the cotton growth stages in 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 5 compared to the pmd treatment the spatial variation in soil temperature in the nmd treatment was small in the middle of the growing season soil temperature was higher at wr under mulching while the temperature at the bs was always lower between july and september during both years soil temperatures fluctuated rapidly after september soil temperature decreased linearly the spatial and temporal differences in soil moisture were large regardless of mulching the soil moisture contents at nr were highest the soil under the nmd treatment at wr was wetter during the early and middle growth period than the bare soil between the two strips by the end of the growth period these spatial differences were no longer significant the growth stages of the pmd treatment were earlier than those of the nmd table 2 especially in terms of emergence a 4 day difference squaring an 11 day difference in 2015 and 14 days in 2016 and the flowering stage a 9 day difference in 2015 and 13 days in 2016 the average biomass and lint yield under pmd were also significantly higher than under nmd by 61 49 and 12 83 p values were 0 034 and 0 039 in 2015 0 024 and 0 032 in 2016 respectively 3 2 temporal and spatial variations in co2 emissions the seasonal variations in soil respiration were similar to those of air temperature fig 5 rs was higher gradually during the early growth stage and then sharply decreased after flowering compared with the npm treatment rs was relatively high at nr and wr locations under mulching in the early growth stage the differences between nr and wr were not significant while nr was significantly higher than wr late in the growing season the rs values in the strips of bare soil reflected little fluctuation and were the lowest in the study sites 3 3 relationships between soil respiration and soil climate soil respiration increased exponentially with soil temperature fig 6 and the correlation coefficient was 0 480 and 0 427 with and without plastic mulch p values were both 0 000 respectively compared with pmd treatment the majority of rs values in the nmd treatment were small the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration q10 ranged from pmd 1 73 to nmd 1 63 to bare soil 1 59 soil respiration was positively correlated with soil moisture fig 7 but the correlation coefficient was low r2 was 0 205 p value was 0 000 soil moisture changed dramatically at 10 cm depth throughout the growing season so no clear correlation was identified 3 4 total co2 emissions in the cotton field the total annual co2 emissions were similar for the two years nr with mulching had the highest emissions followed by wr fig 8 under the nmd treatment the total co2 emissions in the nr and wr were smaller than that of the mulched treatment however the values of bare soil co2 emissions under mulching were similar to those under no plastic compared with bare soil the average values from the narrow rows and wide rows were 43 and 23 higher respectively over the two cotton growing years the total co2 emission was significantly increased by 25 34 and 28 90 at nr and wr by pmd p values were 0 006 at nr and 0 010 at wr in the first year and 0 000 at same rows in the second year respectively and there was no significant difference appeared at bs p values were 0 757 and 0 918 in the first and second growing seasons respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulching on soil climate and cotton lint yields plastic film mulching has demonstrated an ability to improve soil temperature and reduce soil evaporation since 1975 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 several recent studies have conﬁrmed that plastic film can improve radiation capture and soil temperatures and increase available soil water thus increasing crop yield steinmetz et al 2016 which is consistent with our observations of soil climate and of our increased lint yield fig 4 and table 2 wu et al 2017a b indicated processes of vaporization in the soil appeared in 0 10 cm depth and water vapor evaporating from topsoil was condensation and distillation adhered to the plastic film and then evaporation of condensation water presented secondly in addition tarara 2000 suggested that plastic film mulching changed the surface energy balance and favored a soil temperature increase due to the preferable soil climate using plastic film to mulch ground surface is effective in improving soil productivity gan and siddique 2013 the favorable water heat and fertilization status in the root zone that was provided under the pm treatment contributed to vigorous plant growth and increased yields these features make it an especially appealing management practice in arid and semi arid regions with cold climates 4 2 effects of mulching on temporal and spatial dynamics of soil respiration soil respiration is the cumulative effect of heterotrophic respiration from various sources including soil fauna bacteria and fungi lei et al 2017 relative to forest ecosystems soil respiration in cotton fields are prominently affected by autotrophic respiration the variations in soil respiration were consistent with changes in the growth of cotton soil organic matter was low in the shallow tillage depth in this region cotton growth was controlled by cultivation methods e g mulching irrigation and fertilization the changes in soil conditions under the pmd treatment were closely linked with root growth soil microbial richness and activity mineralization processes and soil porosity all those factors in turn influenced the exchange of co2 between the air and the soil in this study soil respiration was higher between june and august in the narrow rows presumably because root biomass was higher under the drip tape where they had greater access to water and fertilizer fig 4 wide rows got relatively little water and showed correspondingly small values of soil respiration in the bare soil strips where the targeted irrigation could not reach cotton root growth was minimal some prior research has only measured soil respiration in the middle of these strips or in a furrow considering that the barrier effects of the mulching on the gas transfer between soil and atmosphere yu et al 2016 the values of soil respiration under plastic mulch were always higher than their non covered controls in these studies but a growing body of literature asserted that mulching could increase co2 concentrations at 0 40 cm depth tanveer et al 2013 wu et al 2017a b used an isotope based method and found that even hole in the mulch that represent 0 5 5 0 of the whole area of the plastic cover made a big difference in the transportation of water in the soil in our pmd treatment the plastic film might have a weak effect as a barrier to co2 emissions from soil the spatial variations in soil respiration should be considered and calculated to precisely estimate co2 emissions in a cotton field 4 3 effects of mulching on the relationships between soil co2 emissions and soil climate soil temperature was mainly affected by air temperature and leaf area index in the early growth stage when the leaf area index of cotton was low the transparent plastic ﬁlms were able to permit 85 95 of the incoming solar radiation to hit the soil where the heat was retained ham et al 1993 in the middle of the growth stage cotton leaves prevented most solar radiation from reaching the ground and soil moisture increased because of irrigation these two factors led to decreasing soil temperatures plastic film mulching no longer imposed a significant difference in soil temperature after the early growth stages about 45 days after sowing in the cotton growth stage soil moisture was mainly affected by rainfall irrigation and evaporation however since rainfall was scarce and evaporation was heavy in this region mulching and irrigation strongly modified soil water content changes in soil temperature would result in corresponding changes in soil respiration the soil temperature increased in response to the plastic mulch table 3 and soil respiration increased in tandem especially during the early growth stage however soil respiration did not show a close relationship with soil temperature and moisture the reason is that root respiration accounted for 57 87 of the total soil respiration yu and zhao 2015 in this oasis cotton ﬁeld thus we believe that soil respiration has a closer relationship with root biomass than with soil climate soil temperature and water moisture experienced sharp fluctuations a 0 15 cm depths during the typical pmd treatment fig 5 however soil respiration increased with more favorable soil temperature and moisture in this study soil respiration had a closer relationship with the distance between measurement locations and drip irrigation taps indicating that cotton growth imposed more influence on soil respiration 4 4 effects of mulching on total soil co2 emissions considering that plastic ﬁlm mulching practices have become widely accepted in arid semiarid and sub humid regions berger et al 2013 lenka and lal 2013 it is necessary to quantify soil respiration during crop growth stages under mulching in our study compared with nmd treatment the soil total co2 emissions under pmd treatments were 25 34 and 28 90 higher in narrow rows and wide rows respectively these results are consistent with yu et al 2016 who indicated that plastic mulching increased cumulative co2 emissions maestre valero et al 2017 and sing 2013 indicated that a field could act as a sink for co2 but our results indicated that pmd field practices were detrimental to the accumulation of soil organic carbon and discouraged carbon fixation because of the more emissions of co2 total soil co2 efflux is a combination of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration hanson et al 2000 the co2 emission from autotrophic activity root respiration is the consumption of organic material provided from aboveground parts of a plant horwath et al 1994 and co2 lost from heterotrophic activity microbial decomposition are the decomposition of litter and soil organic matter hanson et al 2000 the latter process is unfavorable to increase soil carbon stock capacity the activities of root respiration and microbial decomposition were both subject to soil climate davidson and janssens 2006 plastic film mulching boosted greenhouse gas emissions chen et al 2017 lee et al 2019a and decreased soil carbon stocks cuello et al 2015 lee et al 2019b and the suitability of plastic film mulching might threaten soil quality was always under debating a similar situation found in drip irrigation guo et al 2017 showed that drip irrigation was more effective in stimulating soil co2 emissions and increased the loss of soil organic carbon compared to conventional flood irrigation soil organic carbon is considered as a primary index reflecting soil quality which plays an important role in soil performances bongiorno et al 2019 pmd was significantly increasing crop productivity with accelerating greenhouse gas emissions and having detrimental effects on sustain soil carbon stock which might increase atmospheric co2 and risk the sustainability of soil health 5 conclusion the practice of plastic mulching drip irrigation signiﬁcantly increased co2 emissions p values were 0 006 at narrow rows and 0 010 at wide rows in the first year and 0 000 at same rows in the second year and improved cotton yields p values were 0 039 and 0 032 in 2015 and 2016 respectively in a typical oasis region in china plastic mulching drip irrigation significantly increased soil moisture contents of the 0 40 cm soil profile p values were 0 012 and 0 027 in 2015 and 2016 respectively especially during the pre and mid growth stages of the cotton and the highest value was obtained within the rows of crops under the drip tape meanwhile plastic mulching drip irrigation significantly increased soil temperature at a depth 0 15 cm p values were 0 005 and 0 001 in 2015 and 2016 respectively plastic mulching drip irrigation had a stronger effect on soil respiration and the soil respiration rate under mulching at narrow and wide rows was significantly higher than that with no mulching which was positive correlation with soil temperature and moisture but the coefficients of determination were low r2 was 0 4795 and 0 2051 respectively over the two years of this study the highest soil respiration rate and total co2 emissions were observed from the narrow rows under the mulching in addition mulching significantly increased aboveground biomass of cotton p values were 0 034 and 0 024 over the two years which translated to a higher lint yield accordingly plastic mulching drip irrigation could improve cotton yields in oasis regions at the cost of additional co2 emissions which may threaten the ecological environment declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a

respiration was obtained within the narrow rows under the drip tape regardless of the practice of mulching or not the soil respiration rate under plastic mulch in the narrow and wide rows were on average 28 35 and 22 48 higher than non mulched control meanwhile the amount of total co2 emissions was significantly increased by 25 34 and 28 90 in these same rows respectively p values were 0 006 at narrow rows and 0 010 at wide rows in the first year and 0 000 at same rows in the second year the differences of co2 emission in the bare soil was not significant between mulched plots and non

plastic mulching using drip irrigation and analyzed the relationship among soil respiration rate with soil climates 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site we conducted a field trial in 2015 2016 at the key laboratory of modern water saving irrigation of the xinjiang production and construction corps at shihezi university in xinjiang china 85 59 e 44 19 n 412 m a s l fig 1 the region

site in 2008 2014 2 2 experimental design this experiment compared the results of a control treatment drip irrigation with no mulch nmd with an experimental treatment drip irrigation under plastic mulch pmd each treatment was conducted in triplicate for a total of six field plots each of which was 20 m long and 3 m wide a local cotton cultivar cv xinluzao 22 was planted at a seeding rate of 250 000 plants ha 1 on april 27 2015 and april 21 2016 respectively four rows of cotton were sown under each 145 cm wide strip of plastic film with the color being transparent in this study with 60 cm of bare soil between each strip fig 3 the rows were paired with 20 cm between paired rows narrow row and 45 cm between non paired rows wide row a single wing labyrinth drip tape with emitters every 0 3 m ran down the middle of each narrow row no plastic film was applied in the control group but all other cultivation patterns were the same as the pmd treatment other field management decisions were based on the practices used in local cotton fields nitrogen fertilizer urea and phosphorus fertilizer potassium ammonium phosphate were applied with irrigation to each treatment the details of irrigation and fertilization are shown in table 1 the water pressure in each lateral was 0 06 mpa regulated by pressure gauges and sluice valves installed at the front end of the water supply pipe and the rate of discharge for a single emitter from the drip tape was approximately 1 2 l h 1 all plots received the same quota of irrigation in each year cotton was harvested two times each year during harvest 1 4 m2 samples of cotton were collected manually from the center of each plot and the other ten plants were collected randomly from each plot in order to represent the average growth for biomass measurements 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 soil co2 emission a li 8100 infrared gas analyzer li cor ltd usa was used to measure the co2 flux from the field soils the instrument consisted of a pvc collar with a diameter of 11 5 cm and a height of 13 5 cm the collar was inserted 10 cm into the soil at three locations in the middle of each plot in wide rows wr narrow rows nr and bare soil bs between film strips as shown in fig 3c measurements of rs were collected twice per month during the cotton growth period and each test was conducted twice between 9 00 a m and 11 00 a m local time each measurement took 2 3 min prior to measurements plants living inside the pvc collars were removed to eliminate the effects of aboveground respiration to avoid the interference of rainfall events and irrigation on rs measurements were conducted at least three days after irrigation or precipitation seasonal cumulative co2 emissions during cotton growth period were sequentially calculated as follows singh et al 1999 s e a s o n a l c o 2 e m i s s i o n s i n r i d i where ri is the rate of co2 flux in the ith sampling interval di is the duration of the ith sampling interval in days and n is the sampling number 2 3 2 soil temperatures and soil moisture while soil respiration was being measured soil temperature and moisture were recorded using the li 8100 system soil temperature was measured with rt 1 sensors meter group inc usa at a depth of 5 cm and measurements of soil volumetric water content were gathered with ec 5 soil moisture sensors meter group inc usa at a depth of 10 cm addition soil temperature data were recorded at depths of 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm in each treatment using alcohol thermometers hongxing instruments factory hebei province china at the same time soil samples were collected at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 100 cm and massed before and after being oven dried to determine the gravimetric water content distribution in the soil profile g g 1 the volumetric water content was calculated by gravimetric water content multiplied to the soil bulk density 2 3 3 calculation in accordance with previous measurements of soil temperature and soil co2 efflux the temperature sensitivity of rs was calculated as luan et al 2011 rs ae bt where rs is the soil respiration μmol m 2 s 1 t is the soil temperature measured at 5 cm depth a is the basal rs rate μmol m 2 s 1 and b is a q10 constant calculated as fang et al 2017 q10 e 10b the relationship between volumetric soil water content θ and the soil respiration rate was described by cheng et al 2015 as rs b1 b2θ where b1 and b2 are model parameters 2 4 data analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss 20 0 ibm spss statistics usa a kolmogorov smirnov test was used to determine the frequency distributions of the dependent and independent variables p 0 05 measurement data were analyzed using the one way analysis of variance anova tests the differences among mean values obtained from each treatment were determined using least significant difference tests at a level of α 0 05 the correlations that soil co2 emissions exhibited with soil temperature and soil moisture were determined by calculating pearson correlation coefficients 3 results 3 1 soil climate and cotton lint yield soil climate in the soil profiles at our study site varied over the growth seasons fig 4 and table 3 during the squaring stage prior to irrigation soil moisture was significantly lower 31 74 on average p values were 0 012 and 0 027 in 2015 and 2016 respectively in nmd treatment than in pmd treatment at 0 40 cm depths fig 4a b meanwhile soil temperature was higher 4 12 at 0 15 cm depth in the pmd treatment than in the npm treatment during irrigation the soil water content changed throughout the cotton root zone fig 4c d while soil moisture remained low in wr and bs after the irrigation period i e during the boll opening stage soil moisture in the pmd treatment was similar to the nmd treatment fig 4e f while soil temperature was higher under mulching the changes in soil temperature 5 cm depth and moisture 10 cm depth over the cotton growth stages in 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 5 compared to the pmd treatment the spatial variation in soil temperature in the nmd treatment was small in the middle of the growing season soil temperature was higher at wr under mulching while the temperature at the bs was always lower between july and september during both years soil temperatures fluctuated rapidly after september soil temperature decreased linearly the spatial and temporal differences in soil moisture were large regardless of mulching the soil moisture contents at nr were highest the soil under the nmd treatment at wr was wetter during the early and middle growth period than the bare soil between the two strips by the end of the growth period these spatial differences were no longer significant the growth stages of the pmd treatment were earlier than those of the nmd table 2 especially in terms of emergence a 4 day difference squaring an 11 day difference in 2015 and 14 days in 2016 and the flowering stage a 9 day difference in 2015 and 13 days in 2016 the average biomass and lint yield under pmd were also significantly higher than under nmd by 61 49 and 12 83 p values were 0 034 and 0 039 in 2015 0 024 and 0 032 in 2016 respectively 3 2 temporal and spatial variations in co2 emissions the seasonal variations in soil respiration were similar to those of air temperature fig 5 rs was higher gradually during the early growth stage and then sharply decreased after flowering compared with the npm treatment rs was relatively high at nr and wr locations under mulching in the early growth stage the differences between nr and wr were not significant while nr was significantly higher than wr late in the growing season the rs values in the strips of bare soil reflected little fluctuation and were the lowest in the study sites 3 3 relationships between soil respiration and soil climate soil respiration increased exponentially with soil temperature fig 6 and the correlation coefficient was 0 480 and 0 427 with and without plastic mulch p values were both 0 000 respectively compared with pmd treatment the majority of rs values in the nmd treatment were small the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration q10 ranged from pmd 1 73 to nmd 1 63 to bare soil 1 59 soil respiration was positively correlated with soil moisture fig 7 but the correlation coefficient was low r2 was 0 205 p value was 0 000 soil moisture changed dramatically at 10 cm depth throughout the growing season so no clear correlation was identified 3 4 total co2 emissions in the cotton field the total annual co2 emissions were similar for the two years nr with mulching had the highest emissions followed by wr fig 8 under the nmd treatment the total co2 emissions in the nr and wr were smaller than that of the mulched treatment however the values of bare soil co2 emissions under mulching were similar to those under no plastic compared with bare soil the average values from the narrow rows and wide rows were 43 and 23 higher respectively over the two cotton growing years the total co2 emission was significantly increased by 25 34 and 28 90 at nr and wr by pmd p values were 0 006 at nr and 0 010 at wr in the first year and 0 000 at same rows in the second year respectively and there was no significant difference appeared at bs p values were 0 757 and 0 918 in the first and second growing seasons respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulching on soil climate and cotton lint yields plastic film mulching has demonstrated an ability to improve soil temperature and reduce soil evaporation since 1975 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 several recent studies have conﬁrmed that plastic film can improve radiation capture and soil temperatures and increase available soil water thus increasing crop yield steinmetz et al 2016 which is consistent with our observations of soil climate and of our increased lint yield fig 4 and table 2 wu et al 2017a b indicated processes of vaporization in the soil appeared in 0 10 cm depth and water vapor evaporating from topsoil was condensation and distillation adhered to the plastic film and then evaporation of condensation water presented secondly in addition tarara 2000 suggested that plastic film mulching changed the surface energy balance and favored a soil temperature increase due to the preferable soil climate using plastic film to mulch ground surface is effective in improving soil productivity gan and siddique 2013 the favorable water heat and fertilization status in the root zone that was provided under the pm treatment contributed to vigorous plant growth and increased yields these features make it an especially appealing management practice in arid and semi arid regions with cold climates 4 2 effects of mulching on temporal and spatial dynamics of soil respiration soil respiration is the cumulative effect of heterotrophic respiration from various sources including soil fauna bacteria and fungi lei et al 2017 relative to forest ecosystems soil respiration in cotton fields are prominently affected by autotrophic respiration the variations in soil respiration were consistent with changes in the growth of cotton soil organic matter was low in the shallow tillage depth in this region cotton growth was controlled by cultivation methods e g mulching irrigation and fertilization the changes in soil conditions under the pmd treatment were closely linked with root growth soil microbial richness and activity mineralization processes and soil porosity all those factors in turn influenced the exchange of co2 between the air and the soil in this study soil respiration was higher between june and august in the narrow rows presumably because root biomass was higher under the drip tape where they had greater access to water and fertilizer fig 4 wide rows got relatively little water and showed correspondingly small values of soil respiration in the bare soil strips where the targeted irrigation could not reach cotton root growth was minimal some prior research has only measured soil respiration in the middle of these strips or in a furrow considering that the barrier effects of the mulching on the gas transfer between soil and atmosphere yu et al 2016 the values of soil respiration under plastic mulch were always higher than their non covered controls in these studies but a growing body of literature asserted that mulching could increase co2 concentrations at 0 40 cm depth tanveer et al 2013 wu et al 2017a b used an isotope based method and found that even hole in the mulch that represent 0 5 5 0 of the whole area of the plastic cover made a big difference in the transportation of water in the soil in our pmd treatment the plastic film might have a weak effect as a barrier to co2 emissions from soil the spatial variations in soil respiration should be considered and calculated to precisely estimate co2 emissions in a cotton field 4 3 effects of mulching on the relationships between soil co2 emissions and soil climate soil temperature was mainly affected by air temperature and leaf area index in the early growth stage when the leaf area index of cotton was low the transparent plastic ﬁlms were able to permit 85 95 of the incoming solar radiation to hit the soil where the heat was retained ham et al 1993 in the middle of the growth stage cotton leaves prevented most solar radiation from reaching the ground and soil moisture increased because of irrigation these two factors led to decreasing soil temperatures plastic film mulching no longer imposed a significant difference in soil temperature after the early growth stages about 45 days after sowing in the cotton growth stage soil moisture was mainly affected by rainfall irrigation and evaporation however since rainfall was scarce and evaporation was heavy in this region mulching and irrigation strongly modified soil water content changes in soil temperature would result in corresponding changes in soil respiration the soil temperature increased in response to the plastic mulch table 3 and soil respiration increased in tandem especially during the early growth stage however soil respiration did not show a close relationship with soil temperature and moisture the reason is that root respiration accounted for 57 87 of the total soil respiration yu and zhao 2015 in this oasis cotton ﬁeld thus we believe that soil respiration has a closer relationship with root biomass than with soil climate soil temperature and water moisture experienced sharp fluctuations a 0 15 cm depths during the typical pmd treatment fig 5 however soil respiration increased with more favorable soil temperature and moisture in this study soil respiration had a closer relationship with the distance between measurement locations and drip irrigation taps indicating that cotton growth imposed more influence on soil respiration 4 4 effects of mulching on total soil co2 emissions considering that plastic ﬁlm mulching practices have become widely accepted in arid semiarid and sub humid regions berger et al 2013 lenka and lal 2013 it is necessary to quantify soil respiration during crop growth stages under mulching in our study compared with nmd treatment the soil total co2 emissions under pmd treatments were 25 34 and 28 90 higher in narrow rows and wide rows respectively these results are consistent with yu et al 2016 who indicated that plastic mulching increased cumulative co2 emissions maestre valero et al 2017 and sing 2013 indicated that a field could act as a sink for co2 but our results indicated that pmd field practices were detrimental to the accumulation of soil organic carbon and discouraged carbon fixation because of the more emissions of co2 total soil co2 efflux is a combination of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration hanson et al 2000 the co2 emission from autotrophic activity root respiration is the consumption of organic material provided from aboveground parts of a plant horwath et al 1994 and co2 lost from heterotrophic activity microbial decomposition are the decomposition of litter and soil organic matter hanson et al 2000 the latter process is unfavorable to increase soil carbon stock capacity the activities of root respiration and microbial decomposition were both subject to soil climate davidson and janssens 2006 plastic film mulching boosted greenhouse gas emissions chen et al 2017 lee et al 2019a and decreased soil carbon stocks cuello et al 2015 lee et al 2019b and the suitability of plastic film mulching might threaten soil quality was always under debating a similar situation found in drip irrigation guo et al 2017 showed that drip irrigation was more effective in stimulating soil co2 emissions and increased the loss of soil organic carbon compared to conventional flood irrigation soil organic carbon is considered as a primary index reflecting soil quality which plays an important role in soil performances bongiorno et al 2019 pmd was significantly increasing crop productivity with accelerating greenhouse gas emissions and having detrimental effects on sustain soil carbon stock which might increase atmospheric co2 and risk the sustainability of soil health 5 conclusion the practice of plastic mulching drip irrigation signiﬁcantly increased co2 emissions p values were 0 006 at narrow rows and 0 010 at wide rows in the first year and 0 000 at same rows in the second year and improved cotton yields p values were 0 039 and 0 032 in 2015 and 2016 respectively in a typical oasis region in china plastic mulching drip irrigation significantly increased soil moisture contents of the 0 40 cm soil profile p values were 0 012 and 0 027 in 2015 and 2016 respectively especially during the pre and mid growth stages of the cotton and the highest value was obtained within the rows of crops under the drip tape meanwhile plastic mulching drip irrigation significantly increased soil temperature at a depth 0 15 cm p values were 0 005 and 0 001 in 2015 and 2016 respectively plastic mulching drip irrigation had a stronger effect on soil respiration and the soil respiration rate under mulching at narrow and wide rows was significantly higher than that with no mulching which was positive correlation with soil temperature and moisture but the coefficients of determination were low r2 was 0 4795 and 0 2051 respectively over the two years of this study the highest soil respiration rate and total co2 emissions were observed from the narrow rows under the mulching in addition mulching significantly increased aboveground biomass of cotton p values were 0 034 and 0 024 over the two years which translated to a higher lint yield accordingly plastic mulching drip irrigation could improve cotton yields in oasis regions at the cost of additional co2 emissions which may threaten the ecological environment declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a

10706,the sustainability of spate irrigated agriculture in a semi arid climate depends on efficient use of irrigation water thus efficient capture and storage of soil moisture in the field are crucial for sustained productivity the main objective of this study is to examine the performance of improved field design strategies to manage variable irrigation water supply and application time in the gash agricultural scheme gas in eastern sudan where open end border irrigation is practiced to irrigate large fields with variable sizes that range from 250 to 1250 ha irrigation performance was examined using the winsrfr model for a large sized field 8400 m 500 m continuously irrigated for 25 days but also under alternative designs and irrigation times the performance was evaluated using efficiency adequacy and uniformity criteria the results demonstrate that the current irrigation practices are quite inefficient but could be substantially improved by adopting alternative design and operational strategies a vertical division of the field 8400 m 250 m under the average inflow condition could result in a substantial increase in application efficiency from less than 50 to over 70 distribution uniformity from 0 34 to 0 87 and irrigation adequacy from 0 68 to 1 additionally the fields could be irrigated in considerably less time when an alternate irrigation schedule between two equally divided fields is followed which indicated time savings of 40 under a high inflow rate scenario occurring during a large flood season and a 20 reduction in time under an average inflow rate scenario occurring during a medium flood season therefore this modelling study has demonstrated a great potential to significantly improve irrigation performance by applying alternative field designs and operation strategies in the gas the modelling outcomes confirmed that the farmers indigenous experiment though without a scientific study on the vertical division of a large sized field is indeed successful in improving irrigation performance and could be adopted in other similar conditions keywords field design gash agricultural scheme surface irrigation winsrfr 1 introduction sudan is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change and variability in the world usaid 2016 recently giews 2018 estimated 6 2 million people are vulnerable to severe localized food insecurity due to conflict and weather shocks food insecurity in sudan is directly linked to climatic and non climatic factors including climate change variability osman elasha et al 2006 conflicts internal displacement of the population gundersen 2016 uncertainty in agricultural production muli et al 2018 and low crop productivity siddig and babiker 2012 climate change is also predicted to have the potential to alter natural flow regimes palmer et al 2009 including intermittent rivers such as the gash river in eastern sudan this river is the main source of water supply for a major spate irrigated scheme called the gash agricultural scheme gas gas provides a source of livelihood for a large portion of the population almost 500 000 in eastern sudan most of the population in the scheme area live in poor communities whose livelihood conditions are threatened by the climate based farming systems and increased food insecurity spate irrigation is the practice of diverting flash floods from intermittent ephemeral river beds through irrigation canals to fields surrounded by earthen bunds lawrence and van steenbergen 2005 whereby the large volume of flood water induced by precipitation in the upper catchment is directed to low land and wadi areas haile et al 2006 unlike conventional irrigation which relies on less variable supply from perennial rivers spate irrigation relies on highly variable water supply van steenbergen 1997 in gas water supply variability induces uncertainty in farming decisions due to unpredictable floods in terms of timing volume and frequency fadul et al 2018a 2018b haile et al 2011 variability exerts high pressure on the operational decisions at the intakes of the gas irrigation scheme and on farming decisions the variability is illustrated by flood size large medium or small floods flood timing early or late floods and flood duration short or extended floods fadul et al 2018a 2018b farmers have to deal with the large uncertainty and variability through coping strategies characterized by special arrangements for crop land and water management that have increased their resilience to climate threats fadul et al 2018a 2018b osman elasha et al 2006 for example there are special rules for water and land rotation field design field size and crop choice among others in the past the gas system has been successfully operated for cotton crop production at the upper and middle parts of the field while occasionally the lower end of the field has been used to produce sorghum for home consumption since 1980 irrigated agriculture in gas has been on the decline due to drought periods changes in river course and the change from cash crop to subsistence crop production the majority of the farming communities living in this marginal area were nomadic but forced to settle as a result of droughts war and decline in the vegetation cover this has resulted in large demands on food supply and pressure on the limited water sources and infrastructure to include this large flux of displaced population into farming practice as a result farming communities have had to change their source of living to subsistence farming and livestock grazing as coping strategies to deal with climatic and non climatic risks therefore the cropping pattern has changed from cotton to sorghum as the main crop produced in gas field designs and field water management have been developed to deal with the uncertainty using large border fields and one off water application 25 28 days before a crop is planted however as the cropping pattern has changed and the competition for water increased farmers have started complaining of poor crop yield poor irrigation adequacy and poor water distribution e fadul et al 2018a 2018b therefore in view of the changed water demands we evaluated the field water distribution efficiency and adequacy under the prevailing practice of large fields with open end borders we also explored experiments with adapted field layouts and water application strategies that farmers can adopt on a small scale to improve water distribution efficiency and irrigation adequacy with limited literature on spate irrigation field water management was described in terms of water rights and rules field structures field distribution systems and size of command area haile et al 2011 komakech et al 2011 koppen et al 2007 van steenbergen 1997 van steenbergen et al 2010 previous studies on field design and optimization focused on conventional irrigation systems with a fixed predetermined supply and application time adamala et al 2014 anwar et al 2016 bautista et al 2009b bo et al 2012 salahou et al 2018 zerihun et al 2005 while research on field design in spate irrigation characterized by water supply variability is uncommon moreover research on optimizing field dimensions and application times tco for a range of unpredictable inflow volumes under the complex conditions encountered in spate irrigation are lacking this research is focused on farm improvements that consider field design and field water operation practice to manage water supply variability during large medium and small floods in gas we apply the hydraulic simulation model winsrfr 4 3 1 to examine the performance of field irrigation using application efficiency ae distribution uniformity du and adequacy ad criteria the specific objectives of this research are 1 to determine the optimum field dimensions and application time tco which satisfy the required irrigation depth 2 to establish different scenarios of tco at different inflow rates q representing large medium and small flood seasons and 3 to assess the sensitivity of the selected optimum field dimensions to changes in design parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in an irrigation field in the gash agricultural scheme in kassala state eastern sudan 15ᵒ 27 n 36ᵒ24 e the climate in the study area is semi arid with an average temperature of 31 c during may august and 22 c during september january rainfall is highly seasonal occurring between july and october the average annual rainfall ranges from 260 mm in the southeast to less than 100 mm in the northwest of the gas ifad 2003 high evapotranspiration rates of up to 2000 mm year diminishes the effectiveness of rainfall as the main source of water supply for crop production and makes irrigation a necessary source to compensate for the potential evapotranspiration deficit fao 2016 the gas system is designed to irrigate a total area of one hundred thousand hectare ha mainly using the spate floods from the gash river the irrigation system consists of irrigation intakes main canals secondary canals and field canals there are seven irrigation intakes diverting water through seven main canals to irrigate six irrigation blocks fig 1 secondary canals divert water from the main canals to fields through embankment breaching or via field canals 2 1 1 field water management the border irrigation method is the most dominant technology for field water management in spate irrigation systems this method is suitable for large scale farming characterized by long uniformly graded strips and separated by earth bunds fao 1988 the bunds direct divert large volumes of water flows towards the downstream end over a relatively flat sloped area in a short time this irrigation method suits the production of many food crops which is an important element for food security in poor marginal areas that are sustained by spate irrigation in developing countries in gas water is released from canal offtakes and allowed to pass freely from the upstream head to the downstream open end border fields with variable sizes 250 1250 ha as shown in table 1 substantial variability in the inflow rate entering irrigation fields is common fig 2 the variability of gash river flow is a major constraint for water managers however the design of the conveyance system relies upon maintaining a more or less constant velocity in the main canal using control structures in this way flow variability in the gash river is minimized in the canal system but not yet constant therefore flow application in gas is based on the application time rather than application volume application time is the duration of time allocated to the planned fields within which field offtakes are left continuously open during the irrigation supply currently gas operates on a two yearly rotation system in which the first half of the irrigation fields is irrigated in one season and the second half is left fallow to be irrigated the next season leaving the first half as fallow the effective irrigation period extends for 60 70 days from july to september divided into two periods in the first irrigation period the water is passed through field offtakes to irrigate 60 of the annual planned area the second irrigation period covers the remaining 40 of the planned area for irrigation in that season in the first irrigation period field offtakes supply irrigation water for a period of 25 28 days the second irrigation period starts after the first irrigation is completed water is applied in a one off irrigation approach with no further irrigation amarnath et al 2018 studied water consumption in gas using smart ict to provide weather and water information to smallholders and found that with the farmers practice of one off irrigation application no further irrigation was needed as the soil was well irrigated water movement follows the land slope and or is directed by a system of field spurs carefully distributed along one or both sides of field the embankments three types of field layout systems are distinguished in gas fig 3 type a fields supported by field canals and deflecting spurs type b fields without field canals and spurs and type c vertically divided fields shortcomings of type a are the frequent maintenance requirements of field spurs fig 4 such as rebuilding or relocating type b requires machinery maintenance of field slopes which are often inaccessible the longitudinally divided field type c is rarely found and based on field trials without scientific justification or tests 2 2 data and tools a number of surface irrigation simulation models have been developed to assess border irrigation systems and minimize the complexity of design computations adamala et al 2014 ali 2011 using kinematic waves hydrodynamics zero inertia and volume balance models ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 some of the simulation models for border irrigation include brdrflw strelkoff 1985 border strelkoff 1990 srfr strelkoff et al 1998 zimod abbasi et al 2003 and sides adamala et al 2014 some simulation software such as sirmod sisco and winsrfr perform optimization of field length width and inflow rate using a trial and error approach sirmod walker 1998 2003 is a full hydrodynamic model applying a volume balance model to determine infiltration characteristics for the evaluation simulation and optimization of irrigation parameters such as cross section inflow rate and field slope sisco gillies and smith 2015 smith et al 2009 applies a hydrodynamic solution to the saint venant equation for the simulation evaluation calibration and optimization of surface irrigation and accounts for temporal variations in inflow rates and spatial variability in soil infiltration surface roughness slope and geometry gillies and smith 2015 winsrfr bautista et al 2009a b is a hydraulic simulation software for the improvement of design and operation through optimization of field dimensions and finding the best combination of inflow rate and application time although the winsrfr and sirmod software are incapable of performing optimization of the performance indicators they are the most widely used and comprehensive models adamala et al 2014 winsrfr has the additional advantage of being computationally faster and freely available koech et al 2010 this research applies the winsrfr model for the evaluation of field design and operation in the study area the research utilized primary data for soil texture soil moisture before and after irrigation soil water deficit swd and soil water capacity swd is the difference between soil water capacity and the actual soil moisture the research also used available secondary data collected in 2015 for inflow measurements field geometry of a pilot field in kassala in gas hrc 2016 in addition to the observed advance and recession times along field length by the gas water managers inflow to the field was measured using daily water level and velocity measurements from two field offtakes which were recorded every two hours during the water application time of 16 days from the east offtake and 22 days from the west offtake flow velocity was recorded using float method the observed average inflow rate was based on the average inflows from the two offtakes as shown in fig 2 major difficulties were encountered in obtaining precise field measurements for field infiltration properties due to the inaccessibility of flooded fields fig 5 in the 1970s the national resources and conservation services nrcs of the us department of agriculture developed the concept of intake families nrcs infiltration families as a way of categorizing infiltration behaviour for similar soils usda 1974 the observed soil type of the pilot field was silty clay and can be described by nrcs intake family 0 25 these data were necessary for flow evaluation field design and simulation of alternative strategies using winsrfr 4 3 1 the model combines unsteady flow simulation evaluation parameter estimation system design and optimization of operation bautista et al 2010 using four main windows event analysis design analysis operation analysis and simulation an overview of the technical elements of the model is found in bautista et al 2009b the event analysis provides an assessment of the observed irrigation event while design and operation alternatives are provided by the design and operation windows respectively the simulation window examines different scenarios and conducts a sensitivity analysis bautista et al 2009a an important input in winsrfr is the required irrigation depth dreq which influences the performance estimates bautista et al 2006 the required depth net irrigation depth is the depth of water needed to replace the root zone soil water deficit bautista et al 2012 and can be calculated using the following formula salazar et al 1994 1 d r e q e t c p e g w d b where e t c is the crop evapotranspiration crop water requirement defined as the depth of water needed to meet the water loss through evapotranspiration mm p e is the effective rainfall mm g w is the groundwater contribution through capillary rise mm and d b is the available stored water before irrigation mm this study ignored the gw contribution as no study has been done to quantify this parameter although it has been claimed that gw in gas contributes to satisfy crop needs through capillary rise due to fine soil texture with high silt content and moderate permeability khalid 2009 the author claimed that the contribution of gw to the cwr during the crop development stage especially in september when the moisture in the upper layer is depleted as the type of soils in spate flood plains allows replenishment of moisture through upward flux capillary rise from the deep soil to the upper dried boundary of the soil profile crop water stress is thus to some extent avoided the measured available soil moisture before irrigation db showed a dry soil sample avelino 2012 studied the crop water requirement cwr for sorghum in the kassala block using cropwat software developed by fao in 1990 smith 1992 and found the cwr amounted to 519 mm without an effective rainfall contribution and 400 mm with a rainfall contribution van steenbergen et al 2010 reported a value of 500 mm of stored soil moisture depth from a single irrigation in gas myers 1980 studied the root system of a sorghum grain crop and found that 78 of the root length were in the 40 cm soil depth therefore dreq 600 mm was selected for the analysis since winsrfr can perform only 1 d flow analysis the study assumed a uniform slope which could vary from the actual condition due to poor land levelling that results in surface irregularities and cross slopes a 2 d dimensional simulation studies could better simulate the effect of variation in bed level minimum possible inflow rate and minimum required upstream depth playán et al 1994 therefore the assumptions made are uniform flow graded field no cross slope uniform inflow rate that is uniformly distributed over width and homogeneous soil surface roughness the simulations resulting from this study do not account for the actual practice of manually spreading the water from upstream towards the downstream end field and the use of field spurs which helps in water distribution from lower to higher level parts the performance of an irrigation event was evaluated using efficiency adequacy and uniformity in terms of application efficiency ae irrigation adequacy ad and distribution uniformity du respectively flow advancement along the field was also used in the analysis ae is the fraction of the total volume of water delivered to the farm or field to that which is stored in the root zone to meet the crop evapotranspiration needs irmak et al 2011 ae can also be described in terms of water depth eq 2 fao 1988 reported field application efficiency for irrigation schemes using surface irrigation as follows 60 50 as good 40 as reasonable and 30 as poor ae is considered the primary criterion in the design and management of border irrigation systems zerihun et al 2005 it gives information of water losses through deep percolation and runoff although ae has been widely used as a decision criteria the indicator has been criticized as being subjective to the user choice for the required depth anwar et al 2016 and the possibility of achieving high ae yet inadequate irrigation performance by applying less than cwr to minimize losses to deep percolation irmak et al 2011 2 a e a v e r a g e d e p t h o f i n f l t r a t e d w a t e r s t o r e d i n t h e r o o t z o n e d e p t h o f w a t e r a p

to variations in the design parameters infiltration and roughness characteristics hence the sensitivity of the performance of the selected field layout at different inflow rates and application time was tested under different uncertain parameters 2 2 1 analysis of the scenarios the objective of the scenario analysis was to optimize the practical field layout configuration and operation practice as one method for reducing flood risk due to flow variability in gas the measured data used for the evaluation and calibration analysis were field dimensions 8400 500 m daily inflow hydrographs observed advance and recession curves field slope 13 8 cm km observed average inflow rate 2270 l s application time tco 600 hrs soil type silty clay and estimated manning roughness n 0 08 which is within the basic recommended range of the field roughness conditions 0 06 to 0 09 bautista et al 2009a salahou et al 2018 zhang et al 2006 three strategies were investigated 1 time management 2 field design and time management and 3 field design and flow management fig 6 illustrates the studied strategies while table 2 lists the potential application times tco and inflow rates using very high high average low and very low inflow rates that are assumed to occur during large medium and small flood seasons the design flow of the irrigation fields in gas is based on experience such that 1000 l s is sufficient to irrigate 210 ha on heavy soils and 100 ha on light soil for a duration of 25 28 days a detailed description of the strategies is presented as follows 2 2 1 1 time management strategy under this strategy the impact of change of tco while maintaining the current field design dimensions was examined under variable inflow rates representing extreme and normal conditions such as large medium and small floods performance measures were obtained for different scenarios of potential inflow rates 2600 2400 2100 1600 and 1000 l s and potential tco 672 600 432 300 240 and 168 hrs representing extended and short flood possibilities the examined tco reflects the acceptable practice in terms of the equivalent number of days 28 25 12 5 10 and 7 2 2 1 2 field design and time management strategy this strategy illustrates improvements in the current field design through field division into two equal areas either vertically divided 8400 250 m or horizontally divided 4200 500 m total potential inflow rates were applied in sequence for each sub divided field therefore the total planned tco was divided equally between the two subfields performance indicators for the irrigation scenarios were obtained under potential inflow rates 2600 2400 2100 1600 and 1000 l s and 0 5 tco 336 300 240 and 168 hrs 2 2 1 3 field design and inflow management strategy in this strategy the potential inflow rates were divided equally between sub fields i e two vertically divided fields 8400 250 m or two horizontally divided fields 4200 500 m performance indicators were generated for different scenarios of 0 5 q and tco irrigation of the two sub fields started and ended at exactly the same time to maintain the total planned tco possible inflow rates entering each subfield were 1300 1200 1100 800 500 l s while possible tco were 672 600 432 300 240 and 168 hrs 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the selection of the infiltration parameters for the event analysis was obtained after a lot of trial and error for several empirical infiltration functions presented by the winsrfr model this was done through comparison of the advance and recession curves with those produced by the model the advance curve is a graphical representation of the cumulative distance between field offtake and water front advancement and the time spent from the start of irrigation supply at selected points along the field the recession curve is a graphical representation of the cumulative distance between field offtake and the appearance of the bare soil at selected points on which surface flow starts to drain and the time from the end of application period the judgment was based on prior knowledge of the flow behaviour and observations of advance and recession distance and time the results of the calibration of the observed advance and observed recession curves using the nrcs infiltration family 0 25 showed acceptable agreement with the simulated values as illustrated in fig 7 the root mean square error rmse for advance distance and time were 32 7 m and 30 4 hrs respectively while for the recession distance and time the rmse were 41 8 m and 14 6 hrs respectively although these values seem high for other irrigation systems we think they are quite acceptable for such a long field 8000 m and application time 600 hrs simulation of the current conditions of q 2270 l s above average resulted in poor irrigation performance i e ae 47 du 0 45 ad 0 87 and high deep percolation dp losses 53 it was observed that flow advancement towards the lower end of the field required more time compared to the upper parts of the field due to surface irregularities which slowed flow advancement at the end of application time flow advancement did not reach the tail end of the field however 70 of the field was irrigated after 10 days from the start of irrigation using 55 of the total flow volume 3 2 performance of improved strategies the selection of the optimal strategy was based on the best possible performance optimum of the indicators for each flood scenario the selected operation strategy with optimum irrigation performance meets the crop water requirement which is an important variable in the calculation of the required depth in gas only sorghum crop is currently produced although several indicators were used the highest weight was allocated to the irrigation adequacy to avoid over irrigation where possible secondly the distribution uniformity was observed not to fall below 0 6 where possible application efficiency and flow advancement indicators were the least weighted as they are highly influenced by the deep percolation losses which cannot be avoided due to soil characteristics surface roughness and field slope 3 2 1 time management strategy a hydraulic simulation of the winsrfr model for the time management strategy provided the performance of possible improvements on the current field through change in the application time tco the results as shown in table 3 indicated that fair du 0 7 could only be obtained when high inflow rates applied at high tco 600 hrs similarly full flow advance only occurred at high tco which is also associated with over irrigation conditions ad 1 dp losses were encountered at locations near the intake and reduced towards the tail end locations this is attributed to the upper lower irrigation approach used to distribute irrigation water by gravity which exposes the top head parts of the fields to over irrigation sediment accumulation and large dp losses nevertheless gonzález cebollada et al 2011 attributed this phenomenon to the impact of surface topography therefore increasing the application time to relatively improve performance will not be practical under existing water scarcity and demand pressure this strategy showed poor optimal performance of all the indicators under large medium and small flood seasons the optimal management strategies which provides the maximum possible accepted performance during large flood seasons were observed at tco 480 hrs for q 2600 l s and at tco 600 hrs for q 2400 l s while medium and small flood seasons showed poor performance at all the application times in general the optimum performance showed over irrigation and poor du during large floods and under irrigation and poor du during medium and small floods zero values indicate the absence of water at the least quarter depths however based on field observations of average flow conditions farmers could irrigate 70 of the field using 50 of the flow volume for a period of 10 days and save more irrigation time and flows to irrigate downstream fields this strategy can significantly reduce deep percolation losses in the system 3 2 2 field design and time management strategy simulation results of improved field design and time management q 0 5 tco using vertical division 8400 250 m and horizontal division 4200 500 m resulted in a similar performance during large 2600 l s medium 2100 l s and small 1600 l s flood seasons fig 8 the analysis proceeded with an investigation of a vertically divided field 8400 500 m due to several practical reasons which eliminate the horizontal division choice for example in the horizontal division there is a need to implement a new field canal that extends for more than 4 km with all the risks of conveyance and seepage losses frequent maintenance requirements and the high risk of conflicts for farmers due to rule breaking additionally extensions of conveyance canals that are too long result in large deep percolation losses in the permeable alluvial of the unlined canals found in spate irrigation systems tesfai and stroosnijder 2001 the simulation of the selected vertical division revealed that during the above average flows dp and ro runoff losses accounted for almost 50 of the applied water at tco 240 hrs while ro losses diminish at smaller tco similarly reduction in flow rates to below average results in losses attributed solely to dp therefore an increase in ae was obtained at reduced tco and inflow rates since minimizing dp losses may result in irrigation depth less than required to satisfy crop needs irmak et al 2011 a trade off needs to be made for the possible accepted values du gave good results for almost all the flow rates except at very low flows of q 1000 l s the optimum performance of all indicators were found at tco 168 hrs for very high and high flows tco 240 hrs for average flows and tco 300 hrs for low and very low flows table 4 lists the performance of the field design and time management strategy 3 2 3 field design and flow management strategy simulation results of 0 5 q and tco of the vertically 8400 500 m and horizontally 4200 500 m divided fields resulted in similar performance during large and medium flood seasons however both options resulted in poor performance in small flood seasons therefore the analysis proceeded with an investigation of a vertically divided field table 5 lists the performance of field design and flow management strategy the results of this strategy were found to be comparable to the time management strategy the optimal performance indicators were found for each sub field at tco 480 hrs for q 1300 l s very high flow tco 600 hrs for q 1200 l s high flow and tco 672 hrs for q 1100 l s average and low flow conditions poor du and over irrigation results were observed at the optimum condition higher ae is found to be associated with poor irrigation performance of ad and du particularly at small tco 3 3 optimum choice the field design and time management strategy resulted in higher performance indicator values compared to the other strategies table 6 lists the performance results for the optimum conditions from all the strategies the selection of a feasible yet satisfactory strategy resulted in different application times tco based on the flood size received which confirms the importance of flexibility in operation process when dealing with spate irrigation systems similar findings were obtained by taghizadeh et al 2013 who found that ae could be increased by managing inflow rate q and tco the optimum performance during very high high 2 600 2400 l s average 2100 l s and low 1600 l s inflow rates were obtained at tco 168 240 and 300 hrs respectively fig 9 compares the optimum performance of the time management strategy and field design time management strategy under the best combination of q and tco it was evident that the ad of irrigation du and ae were substantially improved in the field design and time management strategy compared to the other strategies in addition the three performance indicators showed good sustained and uniform performance for a wide range of inflow rates 2600 1600 l s unlike the time management strategy which failed to achieve an acceptable combination of all the performance indicators it is worth noting that the field design and time management strategy requires consideration of the ro losses during high and average flows through providing drainage paths directed for reuse increasing the ae means less water is provided to the crop and groundwater storage while it does not guarantee improvement of irrigation adequacy or uniformity efficiency irmak et al 2011 this was also confirmed by burt et al 1997 who demonstrated that water availability could only be improved by decreasing water consumption the results from surface irrigation modelling showed that the current irrigation practice results in more than 50 dp losses from surface irrigation to groundwater this is in line with the assumption made by swan 1953 that the irrigation system of gas contributed to the groundwater recharge during the irrigation process on the other hand elkrail and ibrahim 2008 stated that infiltration from gash river and local precipitation were the main sources of groundwater recharge still there is no yet an evident based study to confirm these assumptions the impact of gw contribution to the cwr during the crop development stage through capillary rise khalid 2009 is expected to improve ad and du during flood recession periods this research showed that field size and application tco were the main elements which had substantial influence on irrigation performance unlike the findings by gillies et al 2010 who recommended higher inflow rates as an operation strategy to improve surface irrigation performance in furrow systems operation of the optimum strategy is considered a post adaptation measure to the different flood sizes it requires timely control to adopt to the actual flood size as season develops and unfold water management in gas has to deal with the flow variability based on one period of application time that can provide soil moisture storage with the amount of crop water requirement needed rather than a fixed irrigation schedule system based on constant controlled inflows therefore the proposed strategy could easily be maintained and established since it follows the actual practice of a pre defined application time 3 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis of the proposed operation strategy was conducted to test the robustness of the strategy under possible changes in the inputs and design parameters we investigated the impact of changes in the slope s manning s roughness n and required depth dreq on the performance tested variables for different parameters were as follows slope 0 0010 0 0015 0 0020 0 0025 0 0030 manning roughness coefficient 0 04 0 08 0 12 0 16 0 20 required depth 400 500 600 700 800 900 and 1 000 mm the analysis indicated that changes in the values of n showed no significant changes in the performance values the results were in line with the findings of nie et al 2014 who recommended the safe use of average field roughness as a representative value for the whole field similar findings were obtained for changes in slope values under different inflow rates gonzález et al 2011 showed that at very low inflows the distribution uniformity is largely insensitive to the slope on the other hand the sensitivity analysis of dreq during small medium and large flood seasons is illustrated in fig 10 a c during large floods dreq showed significant change in the adequacy performance and resulted in over irrigation at dreq 500 mm and significant under irrigation at dreq 800 mm for medium and small flood seasons over irrigation occurred at dreq 600 mm while under irrigation occurred at dreq 900 mm since dreq is not a defining parameter for du stable values for du were observed therefore any change in the dreq due to change in the cropping pattern or other factors needs the establishment of new operation strategies this was confirmed by saher et al 2014 who indicated that traditional water rights should be modified with a new cropping pattern 4 conclusion operation and management of spate irrigation water using flash floods from ephemeral rivers is becoming more important to farming communities whose livelihood conditions are worsening by climate based farming systems and increased food insecurity to maintain good irrigation performance with sustainable utilization of limited and scarce water resources in the gash spate irrigated scheme recommendations on ranges of possible field inflows and application times are essential three strategies were investigated namely 1 a time management strategy 2 an improved field design and time management strategy and 3 an improved field design and flow management strategy the second strategy resulted in higher performance indicator values compared to the other strategies using improved field design and flow management strategies this research achieved improved performance indicators compared to current field design under different application times and inflow rates the proposed strategy can save 40 of the current application time under the high inflow rate scenario occurring during a large flood season and a 20 reduction in time under the average inflow rate scenario occurring during a medium flood season the proposed strategy could be sustainable for a crop water requirement between 500 800 mm a list of application times at different inflow rates representing very large large average and low flow rates were provided this research showed that field size and application time tco were the main elements which had substantial influence on irrigation performance the modelling outcomes confirmed that the farmers indigenous experiment though without a scientific study on vertical division of a large sized field is indeed successful in improving irrigation performance and could be adopted in other similar conditions under the current field condition reducing 30 of the field area at the tail end can save 60 of the application time under average inflow rates and can reduce 50 of water losses which could be used to irrigate downstream fields further irrigation of tail end fields using the current upstream downstream approach resulted in increased deep percolation losses during low flow conditions reducing the command area can significantly increase the chance of irrigation of the upper head field located further downstream the irrigation offtake the uncertainty involved in field measurements and infiltration parameters that are estimated by the model could be reduced through further research and extensive field measurements for infiltration characteristics of the study area lack of data on gw contribution in the enhancement of irrigation performance through capillary rise the limitation of winsrfr to model the actual non steady flow and field conditions and the complex flow behaviour around the field spurs constitute another limitations in this study funding this work was supported by the netherlands government netherland fellowship program grant number 23719 declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10706,the sustainability of spate irrigated agriculture in a semi arid climate depends on efficient use of irrigation water thus efficient capture and storage of soil moisture in the field are crucial for sustained productivity the main objective of this study is to examine the performance of improved field design strategies to manage variable irrigation water supply and application time in the gash agricultural scheme gas in eastern sudan where open end border irrigation is practiced to irrigate large fields with variable sizes that range from 250 to 1250 ha irrigation performance was examined using the winsrfr model for a large sized field 8400 m 500 m continuously irrigated for 25 days but also under alternative designs and irrigation times the performance was evaluated using efficiency adequacy and uniformity criteria the results demonstrate that the current irrigation practices are quite inefficient but could be substantially improved by adopting alternative design and operational strategies a vertical division of the field 8400 m 250 m under the average inflow condition could result in a substantial increase in application efficiency from less than 50 to over 70 distribution uniformity from 0 34 to 0 87 and irrigation adequacy from 0 68 to 1 additionally the fields could be irrigated in considerably less time when an alternate irrigation schedule between two equally divided fields is followed which indicated time savings of 40 under a high inflow rate scenario occurring during a large flood season and a 20 reduction in time under an average inflow rate scenario occurring during a medium flood season therefore this modelling study has demonstrated a great potential to significantly improve irrigation performance by applying alternative field designs and operation strategies in the gas the modelling outcomes confirmed that the farmers indigenous experiment though without a scientific study on the vertical division of a large sized field is indeed successful in improving irrigation performance and could be adopted in other similar conditions keywords field design gash agricultural scheme surface irrigation winsrfr 1 introduction sudan is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change and variability in the world usaid 2016 recently giews 2018 estimated 6 2 million people are vulnerable to severe localized food insecurity due to conflict and weather shocks food insecurity in sudan is directly linked to climatic and non climatic factors including climate change variability osman elasha et al 2006 conflicts internal displacement of the population gundersen 2016 uncertainty in agricultural production muli et al 2018 and low crop productivity siddig and babiker 2012 climate change is also predicted to have the potential to alter natural flow regimes palmer et al 2009 including intermittent rivers such as the gash river in eastern sudan this river is the main source of water supply for a major spate irrigated scheme called the gash agricultural scheme gas gas provides a source of livelihood for a large portion of the population almost 500 000 in eastern sudan most of the population in the scheme area live in poor communities whose livelihood conditions are threatened by the climate based farming systems and increased food insecurity spate irrigation is the practice of diverting flash floods from intermittent ephemeral river beds through irrigation canals to fields surrounded by earthen bunds lawrence and van steenbergen 2005 whereby the large volume of flood water induced by precipitation in the upper catchment is directed to low land and wadi areas haile et al 2006 unlike conventional irrigation which relies on less variable supply from perennial rivers spate irrigation relies on highly variable water supply van steenbergen 1997 in gas water supply variability induces uncertainty in farming decisions due to unpredictable floods in terms of timing volume and frequency fadul et al 2018a 2018b haile et al 2011 variability exerts high pressure on the operational decisions at the intakes of the gas irrigation scheme and on farming decisions the variability is illustrated by flood size large medium or small floods flood timing early or late floods and flood duration short or extended floods fadul et al 2018a 2018b farmers have to deal with the large uncertainty and variability through coping strategies characterized by special arrangements for crop land and water management that have increased their resilience to climate threats fadul et al 2018a 2018b osman elasha et al 2006 for example there are special rules for water and land rotation field design field size and crop choice among others in the past the gas system has been successfully operated for cotton crop production at the upper and middle parts of the field while occasionally the lower end of the field has been used to produce sorghum for home consumption since 1980 irrigated agriculture in gas has been on the decline due to drought periods changes in river course and the change from cash crop to subsistence crop production the majority of the farming communities living in this marginal area were nomadic but forced to settle as a result of droughts war and decline in the vegetation cover this has resulted in large demands on food supply and pressure on the limited water sources and infrastructure to include this large flux of displaced population into farming practice as a result farming communities have had to change their source of living to subsistence farming and livestock grazing as coping strategies to deal with climatic and non climatic risks therefore the cropping pattern has changed from cotton to sorghum as the main crop produced in gas field designs and field water management have been developed to deal with the uncertainty using large border fields and one off water application 25 28 days before a crop is planted however as the cropping pattern has changed and the competition for water increased farmers have started complaining of poor crop yield poor irrigation adequacy and poor water distribution e fadul et al 2018a 2018b therefore in view of the changed water demands we evaluated the field water distribution efficiency and adequacy under the prevailing practice of large fields with open end borders we also explored experiments with adapted field layouts and water application strategies that farmers can adopt on a small scale to improve water distribution efficiency and irrigation adequacy with limited literature on spate irrigation field water management was described in terms of water rights and rules field structures field distribution systems and size of command area haile et al 2011 komakech et al 2011 koppen et al 2007 van steenbergen 1997 van steenbergen et al 2010 previous studies on field design and optimization focused on conventional irrigation systems with a fixed predetermined supply and application time adamala et al 2014 anwar et al 2016 bautista et al 2009b bo et al 2012 salahou et al 2018 zerihun et al 2005 while research on field design in spate irrigation characterized by water supply variability is uncommon moreover research on optimizing field dimensions and application times tco for a range of unpredictable inflow volumes under the complex conditions encountered in spate irrigation are lacking this research is focused on farm improvements that consider field design and field water operation practice to manage water supply variability during large medium and small floods in gas we apply the hydraulic simulation model winsrfr 4 3 1 to examine the performance of field irrigation using application efficiency ae distribution uniformity du and adequacy ad criteria the specific objectives of this research are 1 to determine the optimum field dimensions and application time tco which satisfy the required irrigation depth 2 to establish different scenarios of tco at different inflow rates q representing large medium and small flood seasons and 3 to assess the sensitivity of the selected optimum field dimensions to changes in design parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in an irrigation field in the gash agricultural scheme in kassala state eastern sudan 15ᵒ 27 n 36ᵒ24 e the climate in the study area is semi arid with an average temperature of 31 c during may august and 22 c during september january rainfall is highly seasonal occurring between july and october the average annual rainfall ranges from 260 mm in the southeast to less than 100 mm in the northwest of the gas ifad 2003 high evapotranspiration rates of up to 2000 mm year diminishes the effectiveness of rainfall as the main source of water supply for crop production and makes irrigation a necessary source to compensate for the potential evapotranspiration deficit fao 2016 the gas system is designed to irrigate a total area of one hundred thousand hectare ha mainly using the spate floods from the gash river the irrigation system consists of irrigation intakes main canals secondary canals and field canals there are seven irrigation intakes diverting water through seven main canals to irrigate six irrigation blocks fig 1 secondary canals divert water from the main canals to fields through embankment breaching or via field canals 2 1 1 field water management the border irrigation method is the most dominant technology for field water management in spate irrigation systems this method is suitable for large scale farming characterized by long uniformly graded strips and separated by earth bunds fao 1988 the bunds direct divert large volumes of water flows towards the downstream end over a relatively flat sloped area in a short time this irrigation method suits the production of many food crops which is an important element for food security in poor marginal areas that are sustained by spate irrigation in developing countries in gas water is released from canal offtakes and allowed to pass freely from the upstream head to the downstream open end border fields with variable sizes 250 1250 ha as shown in table 1 substantial variability in the inflow rate entering irrigation fields is common fig 2 the variability of gash river flow is a major constraint for water managers however the design of the conveyance system relies upon maintaining a more or less constant velocity in the main canal using control structures in this way flow variability in the gash river is minimized in the canal system but not yet constant therefore flow application in gas is based on the application time rather than application volume application time is the duration of time allocated to the planned fields within which field offtakes are left continuously open during the irrigation supply currently gas operates on a two yearly rotation system in which the first half of the irrigation fields is irrigated in one season and the second half is left fallow to be irrigated the next season leaving the first half as fallow the effective irrigation period extends for 60 70 days from july to september divided into two periods in the first irrigation period the water is passed through field offtakes to irrigate 60 of the annual planned area the second irrigation period covers the remaining 40 of the planned area for irrigation in that season in the first irrigation period field offtakes supply irrigation water for a period of 25 28 days the second irrigation period starts after the first irrigation is completed water is applied in a one off irrigation approach with no further irrigation amarnath et al 2018 studied water consumption in gas using smart ict to provide weather and water information to smallholders and found that with the farmers practice of one off irrigation application no further irrigation was needed as the soil was well irrigated water movement follows the land slope and or is directed by a system of field spurs carefully distributed along one or both sides of field the embankments three types of field layout systems are distinguished in gas fig 3 type a fields supported by field canals and deflecting spurs type b fields without field canals and spurs and type c vertically divided fields shortcomings of type a are the frequent maintenance requirements of field spurs fig 4 such as rebuilding or relocating type b requires machinery maintenance of field slopes which are often inaccessible the longitudinally divided field type c is rarely found and based on field trials without scientific justification or tests 2 2 data and tools a number of surface irrigation simulation models have been developed to assess border irrigation systems and minimize the complexity of design computations adamala et al 2014 ali 2011 using kinematic waves hydrodynamics zero inertia and volume balance models ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 some of the simulation models for border irrigation include brdrflw strelkoff 1985 border strelkoff 1990 srfr strelkoff et al 1998 zimod abbasi et al 2003 and sides adamala et al 2014 some simulation software such as sirmod sisco and winsrfr perform optimization of field length width and inflow rate using a trial and error approach sirmod walker 1998 2003 is a full hydrodynamic model applying a volume balance model to determine infiltration characteristics for the evaluation simulation and optimization of irrigation parameters such as cross section inflow rate and field slope sisco gillies and smith 2015 smith et al 2009 applies a hydrodynamic solution to the saint venant equation for the simulation evaluation calibration and optimization of surface irrigation and accounts for temporal variations in inflow rates and spatial variability in soil infiltration surface roughness slope and geometry gillies and smith 2015 winsrfr bautista et al 2009a b is a hydraulic simulation software for the improvement of design and operation through optimization of field dimensions and finding the best combination of inflow rate and application time although the winsrfr and sirmod software are incapable of performing optimization of the performance indicators they are the most widely used and comprehensive models adamala et al 2014 winsrfr has the additional advantage of being computationally faster and freely available koech et al 2010 this research applies the winsrfr model for the evaluation of field design and operation in the study area the research utilized primary data for soil texture soil moisture before and after irrigation soil water deficit swd and soil water capacity swd is the difference between soil water capacity and the actual soil moisture the research also used available secondary data collected in 2015 for inflow measurements field geometry of a pilot field in kassala in gas hrc 2016 in addition to the observed advance and recession times along field length by the gas water managers inflow to the field was measured using daily water level and velocity measurements from two field offtakes which were recorded every two hours during the water application time of 16 days from the east offtake and 22 days from the west offtake flow velocity was recorded using float method the observed average inflow rate was based on the average inflows from the two offtakes as shown in fig 2 major difficulties were encountered in obtaining precise field measurements for field infiltration properties due to the inaccessibility of flooded fields fig 5 in the 1970s the national resources and conservation services nrcs of the us department of agriculture developed the concept of intake families nrcs infiltration families as a way of categorizing infiltration behaviour for similar soils usda 1974 the observed soil type of the pilot field was silty clay and can be described by nrcs intake family 0 25 these data were necessary for flow evaluation field design and simulation of alternative strategies using winsrfr 4 3 1 the model combines unsteady flow simulation evaluation parameter estimation system design and optimization of operation bautista et al 2010 using four main windows event analysis design analysis operation analysis and simulation an overview of the technical elements of the model is found in bautista et al 2009b the event analysis provides an assessment of the observed irrigation event while design and operation alternatives are provided by the design and operation windows respectively the simulation window examines different scenarios and conducts a sensitivity analysis bautista et al 2009a an important input in winsrfr is the required irrigation depth dreq which influences the performance estimates bautista et al 2006 the required depth net irrigation depth is the depth of water needed to replace the root zone soil water deficit bautista et al 2012 and can be calculated using the following formula salazar et al 1994 1 d r e q e t c p e g w d b where e t c is the crop evapotranspiration crop water requirement defined as the depth of water needed to meet the water loss through evapotranspiration mm p e is the effective rainfall mm g w is the groundwater contribution through capillary rise mm and d b is the available stored water before irrigation mm this study ignored the gw contribution as no study has been done to quantify this parameter although it has been claimed that gw in gas contributes to satisfy crop needs through capillary rise due to fine soil texture with high silt content and moderate permeability khalid 2009 the author claimed that the contribution of gw to the cwr during the crop development stage especially in september when the moisture in the upper layer is depleted as the type of soils in spate flood plains allows replenishment of moisture through upward flux capillary rise from the deep soil to the upper dried boundary of the soil profile crop water stress is thus to some extent avoided the measured available soil moisture before irrigation db showed a dry soil sample avelino 2012 studied the crop water requirement cwr for sorghum in the kassala block using cropwat software developed by fao in 1990 smith 1992 and found the cwr amounted to 519 mm without an effective rainfall contribution and 400 mm with a rainfall contribution van steenbergen et al 2010 reported a value of 500 mm of stored soil moisture depth from a single irrigation in gas myers 1980 studied the root system of a sorghum grain crop and found that 78 of the root length were in the 40 cm soil depth therefore dreq 600 mm was selected for the analysis since winsrfr can perform only 1 d flow analysis the study assumed a uniform slope which could vary from the actual condition due to poor land levelling that results in surface irregularities and cross slopes a 2 d dimensional simulation studies could better simulate the effect of variation in bed level minimum possible inflow rate and minimum required upstream depth playán et al 1994 therefore the assumptions made are uniform flow graded field no cross slope uniform inflow rate that is uniformly distributed over width and homogeneous soil surface roughness the simulations resulting from this study do not account for the actual practice of manually spreading the water from upstream towards the downstream end field and the use of field spurs which helps in water distribution from lower to higher level parts the performance of an irrigation event was evaluated using efficiency adequacy and uniformity in terms of application efficiency ae irrigation adequacy ad and distribution uniformity du respectively flow advancement along the field was also used in the analysis ae is the fraction of the total volume of water delivered to the farm or field to that which is stored in the root zone to meet the crop evapotranspiration needs irmak et al 2011 ae can also be described in terms of water depth eq 2 fao 1988 reported field application efficiency for irrigation schemes using surface irrigation as follows 60 50 as good 40 as reasonable and 30 as poor ae is considered the primary criterion in the design and management of border irrigation systems zerihun et al 2005 it gives information of water losses through deep percolation and runoff although ae has been widely used as a decision criteria the indicator has been criticized as being subjective to the user choice for the required depth anwar et al 2016 and the possibility of achieving high ae yet inadequate irrigation performance by applying less than cwr to minimize losses to deep percolation irmak et al 2011 2 a e a v e r a g e d e p t h o f i n f l t r a t e d w a t e r s t o r e d i n t h e r o o t z o n e d e p t h o f w a t e r a p

to variations in the design parameters infiltration and roughness characteristics hence the sensitivity of the performance of the selected field layout at different inflow rates and application time was tested under different uncertain parameters 2 2 1 analysis of the scenarios the objective of the scenario analysis was to optimize the practical field layout configuration and operation practice as one method for reducing flood risk due to flow variability in gas the measured data used for the evaluation and calibration analysis were field dimensions 8400 500 m daily inflow hydrographs observed advance and recession curves field slope 13 8 cm km observed average inflow rate 2270 l s application time tco 600 hrs soil type silty clay and estimated manning roughness n 0 08 which is within the basic recommended range of the field roughness conditions 0 06 to 0 09 bautista et al 2009a salahou et al 2018 zhang et al 2006 three strategies were investigated 1 time management 2 field design and time management and 3 field design and flow management fig 6 illustrates the studied strategies while table 2 lists the potential application times tco and inflow rates using very high high average low and very low inflow rates that are assumed to occur during large medium and small flood seasons the design flow of the irrigation fields in gas is based on experience such that 1000 l s is sufficient to irrigate 210 ha on heavy soils and 100 ha on light soil for a duration of 25 28 days a detailed description of the strategies is presented as follows 2 2 1 1 time management strategy under this strategy the impact of change of tco while maintaining the current field design dimensions was examined under variable inflow rates representing extreme and normal conditions such as large medium and small floods performance measures were obtained for different scenarios of potential inflow rates 2600 2400 2100 1600 and 1000 l s and potential tco 672 600 432 300 240 and 168 hrs representing extended and short flood possibilities the examined tco reflects the acceptable practice in terms of the equivalent number of days 28 25 12 5 10 and 7 2 2 1 2 field design and time management strategy this strategy illustrates improvements in the current field design through field division into two equal areas either vertically divided 8400 250 m or horizontally divided 4200 500 m total potential inflow rates were applied in sequence for each sub divided field therefore the total planned tco was divided equally between the two subfields performance indicators for the irrigation scenarios were obtained under potential inflow rates 2600 2400 2100 1600 and 1000 l s and 0 5 tco 336 300 240 and 168 hrs 2 2 1 3 field design and inflow management strategy in this strategy the potential inflow rates were divided equally between sub fields i e two vertically divided fields 8400 250 m or two horizontally divided fields 4200 500 m performance indicators were generated for different scenarios of 0 5 q and tco irrigation of the two sub fields started and ended at exactly the same time to maintain the total planned tco possible inflow rates entering each subfield were 1300 1200 1100 800 500 l s while possible tco were 672 600 432 300 240 and 168 hrs 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the selection of the infiltration parameters for the event analysis was obtained after a lot of trial and error for several empirical infiltration functions presented by the winsrfr model this was done through comparison of the advance and recession curves with those produced by the model the advance curve is a graphical representation of the cumulative distance between field offtake and water front advancement and the time spent from the start of irrigation supply at selected points along the field the recession curve is a graphical representation of the cumulative distance between field offtake and the appearance of the bare soil at selected points on which surface flow starts to drain and the time from the end of application period the judgment was based on prior knowledge of the flow behaviour and observations of advance and recession distance and time the results of the calibration of the observed advance and observed recession curves using the nrcs infiltration family 0 25 showed acceptable agreement with the simulated values as illustrated in fig 7 the root mean square error rmse for advance distance and time were 32 7 m and 30 4 hrs respectively while for the recession distance and time the rmse were 41 8 m and 14 6 hrs respectively although these values seem high for other irrigation systems we think they are quite acceptable for such a long field 8000 m and application time 600 hrs simulation of the current conditions of q 2270 l s above average resulted in poor irrigation performance i e ae 47 du 0 45 ad 0 87 and high deep percolation dp losses 53 it was observed that flow advancement towards the lower end of the field required more time compared to the upper parts of the field due to surface irregularities which slowed flow advancement at the end of application time flow advancement did not reach the tail end of the field however 70 of the field was irrigated after 10 days from the start of irrigation using 55 of the total flow volume 3 2 performance of improved strategies the selection of the optimal strategy was based on the best possible performance optimum of the indicators for each flood scenario the selected operation strategy with optimum irrigation performance meets the crop water requirement which is an important variable in the calculation of the required depth in gas only sorghum crop is currently produced although several indicators were used the highest weight was allocated to the irrigation adequacy to avoid over irrigation where possible secondly the distribution uniformity was observed not to fall below 0 6 where possible application efficiency and flow advancement indicators were the least weighted as they are highly influenced by the deep percolation losses which cannot be avoided due to soil characteristics surface roughness and field slope 3 2 1 time management strategy a hydraulic simulation of the winsrfr model for the time management strategy provided the performance of possible improvements on the current field through change in the application time tco the results as shown in table 3 indicated that fair du 0 7 could only be obtained when high inflow rates applied at high tco 600 hrs similarly full flow advance only occurred at high tco which is also associated with over irrigation conditions ad 1 dp losses were encountered at locations near the intake and reduced towards the tail end locations this is attributed to the upper lower irrigation approach used to distribute irrigation water by gravity which exposes the top head parts of the fields to over irrigation sediment accumulation and large dp losses nevertheless gonzález cebollada et al 2011 attributed this phenomenon to the impact of surface topography therefore increasing the application time to relatively improve performance will not be practical under existing water scarcity and demand pressure this strategy showed poor optimal performance of all the indicators under large medium and small flood seasons the optimal management strategies which provides the maximum possible accepted performance during large flood seasons were observed at tco 480 hrs for q 2600 l s and at tco 600 hrs for q 2400 l s while medium and small flood seasons showed poor performance at all the application times in general the optimum performance showed over irrigation and poor du during large floods and under irrigation and poor du during medium and small floods zero values indicate the absence of water at the least quarter depths however based on field observations of average flow conditions farmers could irrigate 70 of the field using 50 of the flow volume for a period of 10 days and save more irrigation time and flows to irrigate downstream fields this strategy can significantly reduce deep percolation losses in the system 3 2 2 field design and time management strategy simulation results of improved field design and time management q 0 5 tco using vertical division 8400 250 m and horizontal division 4200 500 m resulted in a similar performance during large 2600 l s medium 2100 l s and small 1600 l s flood seasons fig 8 the analysis proceeded with an investigation of a vertically divided field 8400 500 m due to several practical reasons which eliminate the horizontal division choice for example in the horizontal division there is a need to implement a new field canal that extends for more than 4 km with all the risks of conveyance and seepage losses frequent maintenance requirements and the high risk of conflicts for farmers due to rule breaking additionally extensions of conveyance canals that are too long result in large deep percolation losses in the permeable alluvial of the unlined canals found in spate irrigation systems tesfai and stroosnijder 2001 the simulation of the selected vertical division revealed that during the above average flows dp and ro runoff losses accounted for almost 50 of the applied water at tco 240 hrs while ro losses diminish at smaller tco similarly reduction in flow rates to below average results in losses attributed solely to dp therefore an increase in ae was obtained at reduced tco and inflow rates since minimizing dp losses may result in irrigation depth less than required to satisfy crop needs irmak et al 2011 a trade off needs to be made for the possible accepted values du gave good results for almost all the flow rates except at very low flows of q 1000 l s the optimum performance of all indicators were found at tco 168 hrs for very high and high flows tco 240 hrs for average flows and tco 300 hrs for low and very low flows table 4 lists the performance of the field design and time management strategy 3 2 3 field design and flow management strategy simulation results of 0 5 q and tco of the vertically 8400 500 m and horizontally 4200 500 m divided fields resulted in similar performance during large and medium flood seasons however both options resulted in poor performance in small flood seasons therefore the analysis proceeded with an investigation of a vertically divided field table 5 lists the performance of field design and flow management strategy the results of this strategy were found to be comparable to the time management strategy the optimal performance indicators were found for each sub field at tco 480 hrs for q 1300 l s very high flow tco 600 hrs for q 1200 l s high flow and tco 672 hrs for q 1100 l s average and low flow conditions poor du and over irrigation results were observed at the optimum condition higher ae is found to be associated with poor irrigation performance of ad and du particularly at small tco 3 3 optimum choice the field design and time management strategy resulted in higher performance indicator values compared to the other strategies table 6 lists the performance results for the optimum conditions from all the strategies the selection of a feasible yet satisfactory strategy resulted in different application times tco based on the flood size received which confirms the importance of flexibility in operation process when dealing with spate irrigation systems similar findings were obtained by taghizadeh et al 2013 who found that ae could be increased by managing inflow rate q and tco the optimum performance during very high high 2 600 2400 l s average 2100 l s and low 1600 l s inflow rates were obtained at tco 168 240 and 300 hrs respectively fig 9 compares the optimum performance of the time management strategy and field design time management strategy under the best combination of q and tco it was evident that the ad of irrigation du and ae were substantially improved in the field design and time management strategy compared to the other strategies in addition the three performance indicators showed good sustained and uniform performance for a wide range of inflow rates 2600 1600 l s unlike the time management strategy which failed to achieve an acceptable combination of all the performance indicators it is worth noting that the field design and time management strategy requires consideration of the ro losses during high and average flows through providing drainage paths directed for reuse increasing the ae means less water is provided to the crop and groundwater storage while it does not guarantee improvement of irrigation adequacy or uniformity efficiency irmak et al 2011 this was also confirmed by burt et al 1997 who demonstrated that water availability could only be improved by decreasing water consumption the results from surface irrigation modelling showed that the current irrigation practice results in more than 50 dp losses from surface irrigation to groundwater this is in line with the assumption made by swan 1953 that the irrigation system of gas contributed to the groundwater recharge during the irrigation process on the other hand elkrail and ibrahim 2008 stated that infiltration from gash river and local precipitation were the main sources of groundwater recharge still there is no yet an evident based study to confirm these assumptions the impact of gw contribution to the cwr during the crop development stage through capillary rise khalid 2009 is expected to improve ad and du during flood recession periods this research showed that field size and application tco were the main elements which had substantial influence on irrigation performance unlike the findings by gillies et al 2010 who recommended higher inflow rates as an operation strategy to improve surface irrigation performance in furrow systems operation of the optimum strategy is considered a post adaptation measure to the different flood sizes it requires timely control to adopt to the actual flood size as season develops and unfold water management in gas has to deal with the flow variability based on one period of application time that can provide soil moisture storage with the amount of crop water requirement needed rather than a fixed irrigation schedule system based on constant controlled inflows therefore the proposed strategy could easily be maintained and established since it follows the actual practice of a pre defined application time 3 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis of the proposed operation strategy was conducted to test the robustness of the strategy under possible changes in the inputs and design parameters we investigated the impact of changes in the slope s manning s roughness n and required depth dreq on the performance tested variables for different parameters were as follows slope 0 0010 0 0015 0 0020 0 0025 0 0030 manning roughness coefficient 0 04 0 08 0 12 0 16 0 20 required depth 400 500 600 700 800 900 and 1 000 mm the analysis indicated that changes in the values of n showed no significant changes in the performance values the results were in line with the findings of nie et al 2014 who recommended the safe use of average field roughness as a representative value for the whole field similar findings were obtained for changes in slope values under different inflow rates gonzález et al 2011 showed that at very low inflows the distribution uniformity is largely insensitive to the slope on the other hand the sensitivity analysis of dreq during small medium and large flood seasons is illustrated in fig 10 a c during large floods dreq showed significant change in the adequacy performance and resulted in over irrigation at dreq 500 mm and significant under irrigation at dreq 800 mm for medium and small flood seasons over irrigation occurred at dreq 600 mm while under irrigation occurred at dreq 900 mm since dreq is not a defining parameter for du stable values for du were observed therefore any change in the dreq due to change in the cropping pattern or other factors needs the establishment of new operation strategies this was confirmed by saher et al 2014 who indicated that traditional water rights should be modified with a new cropping pattern 4 conclusion operation and management of spate irrigation water using flash floods from ephemeral rivers is becoming more important to farming communities whose livelihood conditions are worsening by climate based farming systems and increased food insecurity to maintain good irrigation performance with sustainable utilization of limited and scarce water resources in the gash spate irrigated scheme recommendations on ranges of possible field inflows and application times are essential three strategies were investigated namely 1 a time management strategy 2 an improved field design and time management strategy and 3 an improved field design and flow management strategy the second strategy resulted in higher performance indicator values compared to the other strategies using improved field design and flow management strategies this research achieved improved performance indicators compared to current field design under different application times and inflow rates the proposed strategy can save 40 of the current application time under the high inflow rate scenario occurring during a large flood season and a 20 reduction in time under the average inflow rate scenario occurring during a medium flood season the proposed strategy could be sustainable for a crop water requirement between 500 800 mm a list of application times at different inflow rates representing very large large average and low flow rates were provided this research showed that field size and application time tco were the main elements which had substantial influence on irrigation performance the modelling outcomes confirmed that the farmers indigenous experiment though without a scientific study on vertical division of a large sized field is indeed successful in improving irrigation performance and could be adopted in other similar conditions under the current field condition reducing 30 of the field area at the tail end can save 60 of the application time under average inflow rates and can reduce 50 of water losses which could be used to irrigate downstream fields further irrigation of tail end fields using the current upstream downstream approach resulted in increased deep percolation losses during low flow conditions reducing the command area can significantly increase the chance of irrigation of the upper head field located further downstream the irrigation offtake the uncertainty involved in field measurements and infiltration parameters that are estimated by the model could be reduced through further research and extensive field measurements for infiltration characteristics of the study area lack of data on gw contribution in the enhancement of irrigation performance through capillary rise the limitation of winsrfr to model the actual non steady flow and field conditions and the complex flow behaviour around the field spurs constitute another limitations in this study funding this work was supported by the netherlands government netherland fellowship program grant number 23719 declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10707,the granier thermal dissipation td method is probably the most applied method to compute the transpiration flux of trees due to its simplicity and effective compromise between theory and data availability starting from the heat transfer equations at the basis of granier s method the objective of this paper is to derive an analytical solution for the transpiration flux to extend the sap flow equations to the radial domain we adopted a flexible approach to cope with the differences in radial sapflow density sfd profile shapes that are known to occur in relation to wood anatomy diffuse porous vs ring or non porous xylem with this purpose we investigated the robustness of the equations developed on some experimental and reliable radial sfd measurements available in literature to test the influence of considering or not considering the active zone close to the cambium where most of the species specific differences are likely to be observed moreover the parameters derived by the extended formulation are interpreted as descriptive of species specific radial sap flow patterns the reliability of the suggested procedure was checked against several experimental sfd profiles from literature i monotonically increasing sfd from the centre of the stem towards the cambium ii increasing sfd from the centre of the stem and then constant sfd towards the cambium and iii increasing sfd from the centre of the stem to a maximum sfd and then decreasing towards the cambium results show that according to the suggested procedure an increasing number of parameters depending on the sfd profile complexity are required to synthetically describe the transpiration flux of different tree species for the simplest case of monotonically increasing sfd which could be assumed as standard

meteorological models or indirectly from micro meteorological measurements by solving the energy balance with a good degree of accuracy in many types of agro ecosystems verstraeten et al 2008 kool et al 2014 however the direct measurement of transpiration is still necessary especially for ecosystems with a high degree of complexity for example while the fao56 methodology allen et al 1998 has proven effective in the estimation of evapotranspiration for many field crops it is widely recognized kool et al 2014 rallo et al 2014 that the et estimation of many tree crops can still be improved due to the complexities of the soil plant atmosphere continuum characteristics of such systems partial soil coverage tree size water capacitance non uniform light distribution within the canopy in widely spaced stands etc allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 furthermore given their large size trees individual features as well as the effects of inter individual competition might generate significant tree to tree variation in transpiration fluxes sperry et al 2008 lehnebach et al 2018 an almost direct measurement of transpiration on a per individual basis can be obtained by a number of sap flow estimation methods with a widely varying degree of complexity a variety of methods are available to calculate the mass flow of water in the transpiration stream by using heat as a tracer measurements can be taken both in herbaceous and woody plants and in any conductive organ including roots depending on the method used measurements are taken in the part of the conductive organ where the sensors are located smith and allen 1996 or in the whole perimeter of the conductive organ sakuratani 1987 baker and nieber 1989 some methods integrate the sap flow in the whole sapwood while others give information to calculate sap flow at different depths below the cambium some methods are invasive with the sensors located within the sapwood others are non invasive with the sensors located outside although in close contact to the conductive organ some methods are suitable for small diameter stems heat balance method while others can be used in large trees a number of variations based on thermal exchange principles have been developed with a variable degree of empirical approximation smith and allen 1996 overall this wide range of methodological options and different implementations available for sap flow estimation by using thermal methods constitutes a valuable and flexible toolset for the estimation of transpirational fluxes and thus has been widely adopted in ecological research wilson et al 2001 in the heat tracer approach i e the injection of heat into the xylematic flow the most commonly adopted methods have been based on measuring the velocity of a heat pulse hp injection huber 1932 marshall 1958 swanson and whitfield 1981 or through an analysis of the thermal dissipation td of a constant rate continuously injected amount of heat granier 1985 variations on the hp method are based on the heat transfer modelling that was established by huber 1932 and marshall 1958 and further developed by swanson and whitfield 1981 and more recently by green et al 2003 burgess et al 2001 and nadezhdina 2017 on the other hand the thermal dissipation td method granier 1985 has often been considered to be empirical and in need of a species specific calibration smith and allen 1996 clearwater et al 1999 this issue has been recently addressed by novel methodological approaches both through heat modelling and through intermittent heat injection mahjoub et al 2009 do et al 2011 and by following both numerical trcala and čermák 2014 and analytical approaches fuchs et al 2017 much like other analytical approaches suggested in different contexts baiamonte 2016 baiamonte and singh 2016 the latter have made it easier to understand the factors affecting the studied process lu et al 2004 and wullschleger et al 2011 analysing the td methods showed that since they are intrinsically based on the fundamental heat transfer laws they are still an important and challenging aspect of ecological application studies however due to the non linear relationship between sap flux density and the heat transfer coefficient the granier method requires a species specific calibration smith and allen 1996 and should be performed within a defined portion of the sapwood moreover the uncertainty in determining the zero flow condition constitutes one of the main limits in using the td method regalado and ritter 2007 rabbel et al 2016 since sap flux density sfd estimates obtained through hp or td are intrinsically localized because only a small portion of sapwood is sampled upscaling sfd to the whole xylematic tissue is a challenging problem in many circumstances local sfd estimates have been extrapolated by simply multiplying by the sapwood area implicitly assuming an azimuthal homogeneity of the sfd throughout the sapwood however this methodology has received an attentive and thorough criticism smith and allen 1996 köstner et al 1998 čermák and nadezhdina 1998 td methods are usually applied to the external sapwood area near the cambium and thus they do not consider the radial sap flow patterns shown in many measurements moreover neglecting such patterns could lead to the over under estimation of the transpiration flux if integrated into the entire sapwood area contrary to the td methods hp methods can easily explore the radial changes of xylem sap flow by the simple insertion of additional temperature sensors suitably spaced inside each probe these sensors are considered independent on the basis of the assumption that the heat injected by the short pulses is dissipated in the vertical direction through mass flow and that radial sensor to sensor diffusion of heat is negligible one dimensional model swanson and whitfield 1981 on the contrary td methods using standard granier probes neglect radial sapflow patterns assuming that the largest contribution to the sapflow transfer is limited to the external xylematic area james et al 2002 granier 1985 however radial variation in the sfd has been observed in many studies lu et al 2000 nadezhdina et al 2007 alvarado barrientos et al 2013 as well as many others including numerical modelling approaches wullschleger et al 2011 with an increasing sfd pattern from the centre of the stem to the cambium within the sapwood area the reported patterns of radial changes in sfd are highly variable even within the same study and the same species nadezhdina et al 2007 poyatos et al 2007 hérnandez santana et al 2008a b revealing uncertainties especially in the sapwood area close to the cambium lu et al 2004 some dependence on tree size has also been reported delzon et al 2004 in general an increase in the sfd from the centre towards the xylem portion closer to the cambium seems to be the most frequently reported pattern in agreement with what could be expected for tree species with annual ring growth such as dicotyledons and conifers with differences depending on wood types diffuse porous ring porous non porous phillips et al 1996 bush et al 2010 berdanier et al 2014 the sap velocity peak has been reported to occur at some depth from the cambium in non porous tracheid xylem anatomy conifer species ford et al 2004a 2004b whereas a monotonic increase from the centre towards the cambium is more frequently observed in diffuse porous species fernandez et al 2001 gonzález altozano et al 2018 berdanier 2014 chang et al 2014 fan et al 2018 a lower sfd in the most exterior parts of the xylem close to cambium has been reported in a number of studies ford et al 2004a fernandez et al 2006 which attribute it to a number of factors such as the lower functionality of these xylem regions changes in xylem hydraulic conductivity in relation to embolism events jiménez et al 2000 fernandez et al 2001 melcher and zwieniecki 2013 the vascular connection of specific xylem zones to other parts of the tree namely the canopy and root system phillips et al 1996 nadezhdina and čermák 2003 brooks et al 2003 fernandez et al 2008 cao et al 2018 or even diurnal dynamics ford et al 2004a fernandez et al 2006 nadezhdina et al 2007 saveyn et al 2008 motisi et al 2012 bai et al 2015 hernandez santana et al 2016 on rare occasions opposite patterns i e a decreasing sfd from the centre to the cambium were reported but with no clear interpretation asian pear fernandez et al 2008 radial sfd gradients implies that some uncertainties in upscaling remain however this has been addressed in terms of the magnitude and significance of sampling errors in very few studies dye et al 1991 hatton and wu 1995 wullschleger and king 2000 tree to tree variation in sfd has also been observed to change with tree hydraulic architecture sperry et al 2008 kumagai et al 2005 and size introducing a further uncertainty in upscaling sfd to a whole stand this supports the idea that an accurate sfd estimation on a per tree basis must include a sufficient number of observations to account for the individual variability within a stand thus the radial sfd variability in the simple td method is still an open issue that could be addressed by developing simple analytical approaches providing initial insight on the studied process prior to the application of time consuming numerical methods the objective of this paper is to derive an analytical solution for the transpiration flux es under radial sap flow patterns following granier s method and to investigate the suitability of the derived solution to cope with both monotonic and non monotonic sfd profiles according to the different shapes that they can assume moreover an attempt is made to interpret the parameters derived by the extended formulation as descriptive of species specific radial sap flow patterns 2 theory granier 1985 assumed that for a constant 0 2 w of electric power delivered to heated probes via a coiled constantly heated element and under a one dimensional steady state thermal regime between the heating element and the medium wood sap the contribution of heat power by the joule effect is equal to the amount of heat dissipated at the sensor wall 1 h s t t r i 2 where h w m 2 k 1 is the heat transfer coefficient s m2 is the surface exchange area r ω is the electric resistance i a is the electric current t c is the probe temperature and t c is the temperature of the wood material in the absence of any heating it was also assumed that the coefficient h is linearly related to the sap flux density ν m s according to an α coefficient by the following equation lu et al 2004 2 h h 0 1 α ν b where in the original formulation the exponent b equals 1 to account for the assumed linearity and h0 is the heat transfer coefficient under zero flux if the probe temperature at zero flux is denoted as tmax eq 2 and eq 1 make it possible to determine the coefficient h0 3 h 0 r i 2 s t max t by using eq 1 and eq 3 for constant ν 0 eq 2 yields 4 ν 1 α 1 b h h 0 1 1 b 1 α 1 b t max t t t 1 b the right hand ratio in bracket is a dimensionless number that was denoted by granier 1985 as the flux index k granier 1985 experimentally showed the relationship between k vs ν giving k 0 0206 ν0 8124 inversion of the latter with respect to ν and a comparison with eq 4 shows that 1 α1 b 118 99 10 6 m s 1 and 1 b 1 231 which are denoted here as cg and kg respectively where the subscript g of both k and c denotes the value of the k and c parameters obtained by granier 1985 via calibration it is important to notice that the experimental value b 1 kg 1 shows that eq 2 is nonlinear eq 4 can be rewritten by introducing the temperature difference between the heated and the reference probe δt c and the temperature difference between the sensor probes under zero flow conditions δtmax c lu et al 2004 5 ν c g δ t max δ t δ t k g where cg is the scale coefficient 0 119 expressed in kg m 2 s 1 kg is the shape exponent 1 231 suggested by granier 1985 and the sap flux density ν is also expressed in kg m 2 s 1 we express the ν unit in kg m 2 s 1 rather than in m s 1 since the latter usually refers to the sap flow velocity whose notation has been discouraged in sap flow studies lemeur et al 2009 by normalizing the temperature difference with respect to its maximum value δtmax and generalizing for any k and c values eq 5 can be further rewritten as 6 ν c 1 δ t δ t max δ t δ t max k for a fixed scale parameter c eq 6 allows the sap flow density sfd ν to be expressed versus the dimensionless ratio δt δtmax with the shape factor k as a parameter values of c and k that differ from those suggested by granier cg and kg were also determined for a number of species probe geometry and trees hydraulic conductivity bush et al 2010 peters et al 2018 however the procedure described in the following can be applied for any pair c k contrary to c which represents the scale factor of eq 6 k influences the shape of the ν relationship for c cg fig 1 graphs ν versus δt δtmax for k kg 1 231 and for different k values around kg 10 kg 20 kg as expected at increasing δt δtmax ν decreases approaching zero for zero flux conditions δt δtmax it is interesting to observe that for δt 0 5 δtmax the same ν cg value occurs for any k value the latter which of course can also be derived by eq 6 has some important implications when applying the granier method first the c i e cg constant has a clear physical meaning since it represents the sap flow density that occurs for any k value when δt 0 5 δtmax second for δt δtmax 0 5 the sap flow density is less sensitive to k whereas for δt δtmax 0 5 the sap flow density is more affected by k therefore from a practical point of view an experimental estimation of k should be performed at high sfds low δt δtmax 2 1 determining transpiration flux for monotonic radial sapflow patterns by assuming a constant δtmax i e constant thermal properties throughout the whole sapwood area eq 6 can be used to extend the granier method to different radial sap flow patterns in other words it is assumed that the temperature difference profile along the radius attains its maximum at the internal sapwood area where zero flux conditions actually take place without the restriction of zero night time sap flow regalado and ritter 2007 moreover it is assumed here that the temperature difference δt between the heated and the reference probe varies along the radial direction of the trunk or of the branch according to a simple power law the latter was used because of its simplicity which has also made it widely considered in many other contexts e g to describe the pressure head flow rate relationship in drip laterals design baiamonte 2018 to describe the allometric scale in the hydraulic scaling of biophysical phenomena west et al 1999 or rainfall intensity duration frequency curves baiamonte and singh 2017 baiamonte 2019 the simple power law applied to the radial sap flow pattern is written in dimensional and dimensionless forms here respectively 7a δ t δ t min r m 1 7b δ t δ t max δ t r m 1 where δtmin is the minimum value of the temperature difference along the trunk radius i e δt at maximum sap flow density δt denotes the ratio δtmin δtmax r r rc is the distance between the measuring point and the trunk or branch centre r normalized with respect to trunk radius below the cambium r c and m1 is the power law shape factor 0 since ν increases with r if experimental pairs r δt are available m1 and δtmin i e δt can be determined through a linear regression of the corresponding logarithmic values as an example for a fixed δtmin 6 c and for different m1 values fig 2 a plots the temperature difference versus the normalized radius showing that for any m1 value for r approaching to one δt δtmin moreover the figure shows that the selected m1 values cover different δt profile shapes the assumption of eq 7b covers a multitude of δt profiles occurring in heat dissipation probe measurements and as will be shown makes it possible to characterize radial sap flow patterns according to the already defined two parameters with a clear physical meaning δt and m1 substituting eq 7b in eq 6 yields 8 ν c 1 δ t r m 1 δ t r m 1 k c δ t max δ t min r m 1 δ t min r m 1 k for the same m1 values used in fig 2a for c cg and k kg and as an example for a fixed δt 0 2 eq 8 is plotted in fig 2b indicating that using the power law to describe the δt profile makes it possible to reproduce a multitude of radial sfd patterns including the constant and the linear sfd profiles that are achieved for m1 0 and m1 0 66 respectively interestingly m1 0 dashed line corresponds to a uniform sfd over the whole sap flow area moreover fig 2b shows that for m1 0 66 the sfd profile is characterized by a concave shape whereas for m1 0 66 the sfd profile is characterized by a convex shape both shapes could be useful for reproducing experimental radial sap flow patterns ford et al 2004a berdanier et al 2016 by putting in eq 8 ν 0 and solving by r it is also possible to derive the normalized measuring point that corresponds to the zero flux condition r 0 9 r 0 1 δ t 1 m 1 whereas for r 1 eq 8 provides the maximum sfd ν max which under monotonically increasing sfd vs r could be attained at the cambium bush et al 2010 berdanier et al 2014 in order to derive the transpiration rate at the tree scale etree kg s 1 under the simplified assumption of radial symmetry and in order to account for the sfd variability versus the radial direction eq 8 has to be integrated 10 e t r e e 2 π r 1 r 2 v r d r 2 π r c 2 r 1 r 2 v r d r where r 1 and r 2 are the normalized nearest and the farthest measurement points from the trunk centre respectively integration eq 10 provides the following solution for the transpiration rate es kg s 1 m 2 normalized with respect to the cross sectional

if c and k are known or are fixed as equal to those suggested by granier 1985 cg and kg es depends on four parameters δt m1 r 1 r 2 eq 11a in agreement with eq 7b is delimited by the real solutions

r 2 1 and for granier s parameters c cg and k kg fig 3 a shows the transpiration rate es g mm h 1 versus δt with different m1 values as a parameter calculated according to eq 11a fig 3a shows the high es g variability four orders of magnitude including all the possible es g values according to m1 and δt parameters however the lowest range of δt corresponds to very high and unrealistic sfd fluxes which are quite far from the usual range as expected with increasing δt es g decreases approaching to the zero flux condition for δt 1 δtmin δtmax whereas for fixed δt es g increases with m1 showing the influence of the shape parameter m1 on es g which according to what would be expected is less and less evident for very high and very low δt values similar considerations are valid for fig 3b where the vertical axis is delimited to the most common transpiration rate values 1 1000 mm h 1 that are most likely to be useful for applications compared to that of fig 3a in both fig 3a and b eq 11b s delimitation of the real solutions domain expressed is also represented in conclusion the fusiform shape delimited by the curves displayed in these two figures cover the transpiration rate that could be expected for any tree species if exploring the r 1 r 2 domain as an example for an experimental sfd profile which will be considered in section 3 id 5 table 1 fig 4 illustrates the normalized measuring point corresponding to the zero flux condition r 0 the normalized nearest and farthest measurement points from the trunk centre r 1 and r 2 together with the monotonically increasing sfd profile abc eq 8 which was derived by ignoring the measurement point at r 3 r 2 1 ν3 in fact the latter occurrence requires further derivations for non monotonic radial sapflow patterns profile abe which will be considered in the next section eq 11a makes it possible to describe the transpiration rate for any monotonic radial sapflow pattern and for any domain delimited by r 1 and r 2 if r 1 and r 2 are located around the zero flux zone and around the cambium eq 11a provides a good approximation of the transpiration rate however if this condition does not occur eq 11a could underestimate the transpiration rate in this case a transpiration rate close to the actual one could be determined by extrapolating the sfd profile on both r 0 and r 2 1 sides towards this aim by putting the constraints r 1 r 0 eq 9 and r 2 1 in eq 11a es could be derived for the entire range r 0 1 see eq a 6 in appendix a 12 e s 2 c m 1 δ t 2 m 1 b δ t 2 m 1 k 1 k b 2 m 1 k 1 k where for this case the last term b in the right hand matches the complete beta function caylor and dragoni 2009 alvarado barrientos 2013 interestingly for a fixed c and k es calculated in the range r 0 1 only depends on m1 and δt 2 2 determining transpiration flux for non monotonic radial sapflow patterns eq 11a can only be used for monotonic radial sapflow patterns e g diffuse pore species non monotonic radial sapflow patterns can be considered by introducing two more simple cases in the first case if the farthest measurement points from the trunk centre r 2 is far from the cambium rather than extrapolating the monotonic sfd increase as for eq 11a a constant sfd was assumed in r 2 1 in the second case if experimental measurements show a sfd decrease in r 2 1 a theoretical linear decreasing sfd profile was taken into account these last two occurrences are also illustrated in fig 4 where the sfd profile abd and abe are plotted respectively deriving the transpiration rate solution by assuming a constant sfd in r 2 1 also makes it possible to study the influence of extrapolating the sfd profile in an es estimate according to the farthest measurement point from the trunk centre for r r 2 1 abd in fig 4 therefore for the abd profile illustrated in fig 4 the following solution for the transpiration rate was derived see appendix b 13 e s 2 c m 1 δ t 2 m 1 b r 2 m 1 δ t 2 m 1 k 1 k b 2 m 1 k 1 k c 1 δ t r 2 m 1 δ t r 2 m 1 k 1 r 2 2 for the second sfd profile abe in fig 4 this time including the measurement points at r 3 close to the cambium for r r 2 1 be it is assumed that the sfd linearly decreases with the dimensionless radius accordingly the following solution for the transpiration rate was derived see appendix c 14 e s 2 c n δ t 2 n b r 2 n δ t 2 n k 1 k b 2 n k 1 k 2 m 2 3 1 r 2 3 n 1 r 2 2 where m2 and n are the gradient and the ν intercept of the ν r line in the domain r 2 1 two cases can be distinguished when determining m2 and n depending on the availability of only one or more than one measurement point in the domain r 2 1 if only one sfd measurement in the r 2 1 domain is available meaning that only a pair r 3 ν 3 is known see fig 4 m2 and n can be easily calculated as 15 m 2 ν 2 ν 3 r 2 r 3 16 n r 2 ν 3 ν 2 r 3 r 2 r 3 where ν 2 and ν 3 are the transpiration fluxes corresponding to r 2 and r 3 respectively if more than one sfd measurement in the r 2 1 domain is available m2 can be calculated according to a simple constrained linear regression for the experimental pairs r r 2 ν ν 2 and by imposing n so that in r 2 the corresponding ν 2 value equals that calculated according to eq 8 17 n ν 2 m 2 r 2 c 1 δ t r 2 m 1 δ t r 2 n k m 2 r 2 3 deriving m1 and δt parameters from radial sap flow density measurements eq 8 can be used to extend our analysis to sfd profiles where actual δt data is not available since methods other than td such as hpv were used differently from what was observed in section 2 1 where the experimental pairs r δt were available eq 7b m1 and δt can be as well determined directly from sfd profile data by rearranging eq 8 18 r m 1 1 δ t 1 ν 1 k c 1 k taking the logarithm of both sides of eq 18 yields 19a m 1 ln r ln 1 δ t 1 ν 1 k c 1 k rearranging eq 19a once again gives the linear form 19b ln 1 ν 1 k c 1 k n 1 ln r ln δ t ln 1 ν 1 k c 1 k m 1 ln r ln δ t thus from the simple linear regression of the pairs ln r ln 1 ν1 k c 1 k m1 and δt can be determined it is interesting to observe that if the method used to detect radial sfd patterns differs from that of granier using eq 19b provides the same parameters m1 δt that would have been obtained if the granier method had been used 3 1 experimental literature data to test the proposed method the sfd measurements published by nadezhdina et al 2007 obtained in olive trees by the heat field deformation method hfd nadezhdina et al 1998 nadezhdina and čermák 2000 čermák et al 2004 nadezhdina et al 2006 were used as a dataset to derive the corresponding parameters m1 δt that would have been obtained under granier method eleven radial sap flow profiles with different shapes were selected from nadezhdina et al 2007 and the corresponding pairs r ν were obtained from the figures through digitizing engauge digitizer software mitchell et al 2019 an application was carried out in order to check the ability of eq 12 to calculate under the radial symmetry assumption the transpiration rate normalized with respect the cross sectional area es moreover 2 sfd profiles measured for peach trees gonzález altozano et al 2018 were also selected for a total of 13 sfd profiles table 1 towards this aim for the 13 selected sfd profiles table 1 reports the sap flow location measurements trunk or branch the trunk or branch radius rc mm the figure number corresponding to nadezhdina et al 2007 and gonzález altozano et al 2018 references m1 and δt calculated by fitting the linear regression of eq 19b and the normalized radius corresponding to the zero flux r 0 eq 9 in table 1 for all of the cases in which sfd profiles decrease along the radius in r r 2 1 sfd 1 5 8 9 10 and 11 the δt and m1 parameters which refer to the monotonic radial profile in r 0 1 eq 12 fig 4 abc were calculated by excluding the experimental pairs in r r 2 1 fig 5 graphs the experimental pairs r ν and the theoretical sfd expressed by eq 8 with the m1 and δt parameters reported in table 1 as can be observed in fig 5 eq 8 appears to suitably explain the investigated radial sfd patterns indeed the selected profiles cover different radial sfd patterns with different m1 values including the almost constant sfd corresponding to the id10 profile for which the shape parameters among those associated with the selected profiles table 1 equals the maximum value m1 0 091 which is close to zero constant sfd profile as mentioned above the aim of this application was also to detect the effect of extrapolating the sfd profile until the cambium or of assuming the sfd profile to be constant or decreasing from the furthest measurement from the centre trunk r r 2 to the cambium r 1 according to eqs 13 and 14 respectively for this purpose the ν value calculated at r 2 by eq 8 was assumed to be constant in r 2 1 for all of the considered 13 sfd profiles whereas the m2 and n parameters were only calculated for the radial sfd measurements id 1 5 8 9 10 and 11 fig 5a b d e where a decreasing sfd profile was observed in r 2 1 moreover for sfd profiles id 8 and 9 which had more than two measurements presenting a decreasing sfd in r 2 1 as observed above m2 was determined by linear regression whereas the n parameter was calculated by eq 17 for the remaining profiles with a decreasing sfd with only one measurement in r 2 1 m2 and n were calculated by eqs 15 and 16 respectively of course for sfd profiles id 2 3 4 6 7 12 and 13 sfd was observed to increase monotonically eq 14 was not applied and m2 and n were not estimated table 1 in table 1 the sfd profiles where m2 and n parameters were obtained by linear regression are indicated by a star symbol 4 results of the applications fig 6 a plots the 13 theoretical sfd profiles under the assumption of a monotonic radial sapflow pattern in r 0 1 indicating that they actually cover a variety of sfd shapes in agreement with the wide range of variability of the m1 parameter reported in table 1 0 892 0 091 in particular eq 8 also describes the sap flow profile id10 m1 0 091 well for which an almost constant sfd profile occurs until it approaches the case in which radial sfd variability is neglected ν constant however it might be easier to calculate the transpiration rate for this simple case according to es ν r 2 2 r 0 2 whereas the extended formulation is required for all of the others which refer to different radial sap flow patterns once the m1 and δt parameters have been estimated eq 7b makes it possible to derive the corresponding temperature difference profiles that would have been determined if the extended granier method had been used to determine the radial sfd patterns presented in this study the corresponding δt profiles are plotted in fig 6b showing that as expected for r 1 the ratio δt δtmin δtmax for each profile is achieved whereas δt 1 in r 0 table 1 for the sfd profiles described in section 3 in order to investigate the suitability of the derived solution to cope with both monotonic and non monotonic sfd profiles according to the different shapes that they may assume the transpiration rate was calculated by considering the following three radial patterns i monotonically increasing sfd in the domain r 0 1 eq 12 abc in fig 4 ii monotonically increasing sfd in the domain r 0 r 2 and constant sfd in r 2 1 eq 13 abd in fig 4 and iii monotonically increasing sfd in the domain r 0 r 2 and decreasing sfd in r 2 1 eq 14 abe in fig 4 fig 7 reports the estimates of es g according to eqs 12 14 for the three selected sfd profile shapes the transpiration rate can be observed to be in the range 50 320 mm h however the hypotheses assumed in eqs 12 14 have a certain influence on the computation of es g as expected differences in es g are linked to the values of the m1 parameter and to the location of the furthest measurement point r 2 see fig 4 for id 2 3 4 6 7 10 12 and 13 differences in the es g estimate appear small because of the high r 2 or m1 values which have a negligible effect on the extrapolation of the sfd to the cambium in particular the latter condition occurs for id 10 with a high m1 value m1 0 091 the greatest differences in calculating es g by extrapolating the sfd profile in r 2 1 eq 12 or by assuming the sfd in r 2 1 eq 13 to be constant can be observed for id 9 which is characterized by low m1 and r 2 values see table 1 for id 8 and 9 with a similar r 2 value differences in es g are also due to the different m2 values that shows more abrupt decrease in sfd for id 9 than id 8 as can be observed in fig 5d in conclusion when sfd measurements do not cover the entire radial sap flow pattern r 2 1 and when the m1 shape factor is low using eq 12 could overestimate the transpiration rate and thus might not be recommended the use of eq 13 which assumes the sfd to be constant from the furthest point measurement to the cambium could be a good compromise between extrapolating the sfd profile in r 2 1 eq 12 and calculating the transpiration rate with eq 14 especially if the sfd decrease in r 2 1 is not supported by an adequate number of observations on the contrary a monotonically increasing sfd profile eq 12 should be preferred if the range of measurements cover the area from the sapwood until the cambium especially for low m1 values with the advantage of describing the transpiration flux with only two parameters m1 and δt moreover with respect to eq 13 and to eq 14 eq 12 could be more advantageous when applied in a wider context and when the transpiration rate has to be upscaled in fact in order to calculate es g eq 12 only requires the two parameters m1 and δt which could be associated with the crop age and with the species characteristic to arrive at an indirect es g estimation in other words the availability of a very wide numbers of sfd profiles or of temperature difference profiles which both make it possible to derive m1 and δt parameters could help delimit the es g domain under reference environmental conditions suggesting an indirect criteria to derive es g in order to locate the selected 13 sfd profiles in the es g δt plane for the case of monotonic radial sapflow patterns eq 12 is graphed in fig 8 for fixed m1 values in the same figure the calculated es g values are plotted for the 13 sfd profiles notwithstanding the fact that sfd measurements are limited to only two species olive id 1 11 and peach id 12 13 the points cover a wide es g δt domain as a consequence of the high variability in the selected sfd profiles probably characterized by different observation times and soil moisture conditions moreover measurements that are often taken under different azimuthal positions and climate conditions nadezhdina et al 2002 may also affect es g and δt variability these results indicate the need to establish standard environmental conditions including soil moisture content sampling time stand age establishing a fixed experimental setup that could lead to locate in the es g δt plane the transpiration rate domains corresponding to different species towards extending the potential evapotranspiration concept which is also defined under reference conditions to the sole transpiration component of the water mass balance 5 conclusions an analytical approach extending the granier method to radial sap flow density sfd patterns showing high flexibility with parameters with a clear physical meaning is suggested the proposed procedure made it possible to develop a general framework to analyse different radial sfd patterns with an increasing number of parameters depending on the sfd profile complexity these parameters were able to synthetically describe the transpiration flux es of different tree species for the simplest case with a monotonically increasing sfd which could be assumed for diffuse porous tree structure only two distinctly physical parameters are required the ratio between the minimum and the maximum temperature difference δt and a shape factor m1 which could be derived by sfd profiles measured by methods other than granier therefore the proposed procedure could be suitable as a meta analysis tool for homogenizing sfd profiles of different species by means of δt and m1 parameters irrespective of the measurement method used the totality of transpiration flux conditions are constrained within a fusiform plane es δt delimited by the analytical solutions derived thus covering the transpiration flux that could be expected for any tree species the high variability of the transpiration flux located in the es δt plane and that of the corresponding m1 and δt parameters which was observed for two different species olive and peach trees suggested that fixing experimental setup associated with standard environmental conditions could lead to locate in the es δt plane according to m1 and δt more restricted transpiration rate domains corresponding to different species towards extending the potential evapotranspiration concept to the sole transpiration component of the water mass balance declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the contribution to the manuscript has to be shared between authors as follows

10707,the granier thermal dissipation td method is probably the most applied method to compute the transpiration flux of trees due to its simplicity and effective compromise between theory and data availability starting from the heat transfer equations at the basis of granier s method the objective of this paper is to derive an analytical solution for the transpiration flux to extend the sap flow equations to the radial domain we adopted a flexible approach to cope with the differences in radial sapflow density sfd profile shapes that are known to occur in relation to wood anatomy diffuse porous vs ring or non porous xylem with this purpose we investigated the robustness of the equations developed on some experimental and reliable radial sfd measurements available in literature to test the influence of considering or not considering the active zone close to the cambium where most of the species specific differences are likely to be observed moreover the parameters derived by the extended formulation are interpreted as descriptive of species specific radial sap flow patterns the reliability of the suggested procedure was checked against several experimental sfd profiles from literature i monotonically increasing sfd from the centre of the stem towards the cambium ii increasing sfd from the centre of the stem and then constant sfd towards the cambium and iii increasing sfd from the centre of the stem to a maximum sfd and then decreasing towards the cambium results show that according to the suggested procedure an increasing number of parameters depending on the sfd profile complexity are required to synthetically describe the transpiration flux of different tree species for the simplest case of monotonically increasing sfd which could be assumed as standard

meteorological models or indirectly from micro meteorological measurements by solving the energy balance with a good degree of accuracy in many types of agro ecosystems verstraeten et al 2008 kool et al 2014 however the direct measurement of transpiration is still necessary especially for ecosystems with a high degree of complexity for example while the fao56 methodology allen et al 1998 has proven effective in the estimation of evapotranspiration for many field crops it is widely recognized kool et al 2014 rallo et al 2014 that the et estimation of many tree crops can still be improved due to the complexities of the soil plant atmosphere continuum characteristics of such systems partial soil coverage tree size water capacitance non uniform light distribution within the canopy in widely spaced stands etc allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 furthermore given their large size trees individual features as well as the effects of inter individual competition might generate significant tree to tree variation in transpiration fluxes sperry et al 2008 lehnebach et al 2018 an almost direct measurement of transpiration on a per individual basis can be obtained by a number of sap flow estimation methods with a widely varying degree of complexity a variety of methods are available to calculate the mass flow of water in the transpiration stream by using heat as a tracer measurements can be taken both in herbaceous and woody plants and in any conductive organ including roots depending on the method used measurements are taken in the part of the conductive organ where the sensors are located smith and allen 1996 or in the whole perimeter of the conductive organ sakuratani 1987 baker and nieber 1989 some methods integrate the sap flow in the whole sapwood while others give information to calculate sap flow at different depths below the cambium some methods are invasive with the sensors located within the sapwood others are non invasive with the sensors located outside although in close contact to the conductive organ some methods are suitable for small diameter stems heat balance method while others can be used in large trees a number of variations based on thermal exchange principles have been developed with a variable degree of empirical approximation smith and allen 1996 overall this wide range of methodological options and different implementations available for sap flow estimation by using thermal methods constitutes a valuable and flexible toolset for the estimation of transpirational fluxes and thus has been widely adopted in ecological research wilson et al 2001 in the heat tracer approach i e the injection of heat into the xylematic flow the most commonly adopted methods have been based on measuring the velocity of a heat pulse hp injection huber 1932 marshall 1958 swanson and whitfield 1981 or through an analysis of the thermal dissipation td of a constant rate continuously injected amount of heat granier 1985 variations on the hp method are based on the heat transfer modelling that was established by huber 1932 and marshall 1958 and further developed by swanson and whitfield 1981 and more recently by green et al 2003 burgess et al 2001 and nadezhdina 2017 on the other hand the thermal dissipation td method granier 1985 has often been considered to be empirical and in need of a species specific calibration smith and allen 1996 clearwater et al 1999 this issue has been recently addressed by novel methodological approaches both through heat modelling and through intermittent heat injection mahjoub et al 2009 do et al 2011 and by following both numerical trcala and čermák 2014 and analytical approaches fuchs et al 2017 much like other analytical approaches suggested in different contexts baiamonte 2016 baiamonte and singh 2016 the latter have made it easier to understand the factors affecting the studied process lu et al 2004 and wullschleger et al 2011 analysing the td methods showed that since they are intrinsically based on the fundamental heat transfer laws they are still an important and challenging aspect of ecological application studies however due to the non linear relationship between sap flux density and the heat transfer coefficient the granier method requires a species specific calibration smith and allen 1996 and should be performed within a defined portion of the sapwood moreover the uncertainty in determining the zero flow condition constitutes one of the main limits in using the td method regalado and ritter 2007 rabbel et al 2016 since sap flux density sfd estimates obtained through hp or td are intrinsically localized because only a small portion of sapwood is sampled upscaling sfd to the whole xylematic tissue is a challenging problem in many circumstances local sfd estimates have been extrapolated by simply multiplying by the sapwood area implicitly assuming an azimuthal homogeneity of the sfd throughout the sapwood however this methodology has received an attentive and thorough criticism smith and allen 1996 köstner et al 1998 čermák and nadezhdina 1998 td methods are usually applied to the external sapwood area near the cambium and thus they do not consider the radial sap flow patterns shown in many measurements moreover neglecting such patterns could lead to the over under estimation of the transpiration flux if integrated into the entire sapwood area contrary to the td methods hp methods can easily explore the radial changes of xylem sap flow by the simple insertion of additional temperature sensors suitably spaced inside each probe these sensors are considered independent on the basis of the assumption that the heat injected by the short pulses is dissipated in the vertical direction through mass flow and that radial sensor to sensor diffusion of heat is negligible one dimensional model swanson and whitfield 1981 on the contrary td methods using standard granier probes neglect radial sapflow patterns assuming that the largest contribution to the sapflow transfer is limited to the external xylematic area james et al 2002 granier 1985 however radial variation in the sfd has been observed in many studies lu et al 2000 nadezhdina et al 2007 alvarado barrientos et al 2013 as well as many others including numerical modelling approaches wullschleger et al 2011 with an increasing sfd pattern from the centre of the stem to the cambium within the sapwood area the reported patterns of radial changes in sfd are highly variable even within the same study and the same species nadezhdina et al 2007 poyatos et al 2007 hérnandez santana et al 2008a b revealing uncertainties especially in the sapwood area close to the cambium lu et al 2004 some dependence on tree size has also been reported delzon et al 2004 in general an increase in the sfd from the centre towards the xylem portion closer to the cambium seems to be the most frequently reported pattern in agreement with what could be expected for tree species with annual ring growth such as dicotyledons and conifers with differences depending on wood types diffuse porous ring porous non porous phillips et al 1996 bush et al 2010 berdanier et al 2014 the sap velocity peak has been reported to occur at some depth from the cambium in non porous tracheid xylem anatomy conifer species ford et al 2004a 2004b whereas a monotonic increase from the centre towards the cambium is more frequently observed in diffuse porous species fernandez et al 2001 gonzález altozano et al 2018 berdanier 2014 chang et al 2014 fan et al 2018 a lower sfd in the most exterior parts of the xylem close to cambium has been reported in a number of studies ford et al 2004a fernandez et al 2006 which attribute it to a number of factors such as the lower functionality of these xylem regions changes in xylem hydraulic conductivity in relation to embolism events jiménez et al 2000 fernandez et al 2001 melcher and zwieniecki 2013 the vascular connection of specific xylem zones to other parts of the tree namely the canopy and root system phillips et al 1996 nadezhdina and čermák 2003 brooks et al 2003 fernandez et al 2008 cao et al 2018 or even diurnal dynamics ford et al 2004a fernandez et al 2006 nadezhdina et al 2007 saveyn et al 2008 motisi et al 2012 bai et al 2015 hernandez santana et al 2016 on rare occasions opposite patterns i e a decreasing sfd from the centre to the cambium were reported but with no clear interpretation asian pear fernandez et al 2008 radial sfd gradients implies that some uncertainties in upscaling remain however this has been addressed in terms of the magnitude and significance of sampling errors in very few studies dye et al 1991 hatton and wu 1995 wullschleger and king 2000 tree to tree variation in sfd has also been observed to change with tree hydraulic architecture sperry et al 2008 kumagai et al 2005 and size introducing a further uncertainty in upscaling sfd to a whole stand this supports the idea that an accurate sfd estimation on a per tree basis must include a sufficient number of observations to account for the individual variability within a stand thus the radial sfd variability in the simple td method is still an open issue that could be addressed by developing simple analytical approaches providing initial insight on the studied process prior to the application of time consuming numerical methods the objective of this paper is to derive an analytical solution for the transpiration flux es under radial sap flow patterns following granier s method and to investigate the suitability of the derived solution to cope with both monotonic and non monotonic sfd profiles according to the different shapes that they can assume moreover an attempt is made to interpret the parameters derived by the extended formulation as descriptive of species specific radial sap flow patterns 2 theory granier 1985 assumed that for a constant 0 2 w of electric power delivered to heated probes via a coiled constantly heated element and under a one dimensional steady state thermal regime between the heating element and the medium wood sap the contribution of heat power by the joule effect is equal to the amount of heat dissipated at the sensor wall 1 h s t t r i 2 where h w m 2 k 1 is the heat transfer coefficient s m2 is the surface exchange area r ω is the electric resistance i a is the electric current t c is the probe temperature and t c is the temperature of the wood material in the absence of any heating it was also assumed that the coefficient h is linearly related to the sap flux density ν m s according to an α coefficient by the following equation lu et al 2004 2 h h 0 1 α ν b where in the original formulation the exponent b equals 1 to account for the assumed linearity and h0 is the heat transfer coefficient under zero flux if the probe temperature at zero flux is denoted as tmax eq 2 and eq 1 make it possible to determine the coefficient h0 3 h 0 r i 2 s t max t by using eq 1 and eq 3 for constant ν 0 eq 2 yields 4 ν 1 α 1 b h h 0 1 1 b 1 α 1 b t max t t t 1 b the right hand ratio in bracket is a dimensionless number that was denoted by granier 1985 as the flux index k granier 1985 experimentally showed the relationship between k vs ν giving k 0 0206 ν0 8124 inversion of the latter with respect to ν and a comparison with eq 4 shows that 1 α1 b 118 99 10 6 m s 1 and 1 b 1 231 which are denoted here as cg and kg respectively where the subscript g of both k and c denotes the value of the k and c parameters obtained by granier 1985 via calibration it is important to notice that the experimental value b 1 kg 1 shows that eq 2 is nonlinear eq 4 can be rewritten by introducing the temperature difference between the heated and the reference probe δt c and the temperature difference between the sensor probes under zero flow conditions δtmax c lu et al 2004 5 ν c g δ t max δ t δ t k g where cg is the scale coefficient 0 119 expressed in kg m 2 s 1 kg is the shape exponent 1 231 suggested by granier 1985 and the sap flux density ν is also expressed in kg m 2 s 1 we express the ν unit in kg m 2 s 1 rather than in m s 1 since the latter usually refers to the sap flow velocity whose notation has been discouraged in sap flow studies lemeur et al 2009 by normalizing the temperature difference with respect to its maximum value δtmax and generalizing for any k and c values eq 5 can be further rewritten as 6 ν c 1 δ t δ t max δ t δ t max k for a fixed scale parameter c eq 6 allows the sap flow density sfd ν to be expressed versus the dimensionless ratio δt δtmax with the shape factor k as a parameter values of c and k that differ from those suggested by granier cg and kg were also determined for a number of species probe geometry and trees hydraulic conductivity bush et al 2010 peters et al 2018 however the procedure described in the following can be applied for any pair c k contrary to c which represents the scale factor of eq 6 k influences the shape of the ν relationship for c cg fig 1 graphs ν versus δt δtmax for k kg 1 231 and for different k values around kg 10 kg 20 kg as expected at increasing δt δtmax ν decreases approaching zero for zero flux conditions δt δtmax it is interesting to observe that for δt 0 5 δtmax the same ν cg value occurs for any k value the latter which of course can also be derived by eq 6 has some important implications when applying the granier method first the c i e cg constant has a clear physical meaning since it represents the sap flow density that occurs for any k value when δt 0 5 δtmax second for δt δtmax 0 5 the sap flow density is less sensitive to k whereas for δt δtmax 0 5 the sap flow density is more affected by k therefore from a practical point of view an experimental estimation of k should be performed at high sfds low δt δtmax 2 1 determining transpiration flux for monotonic radial sapflow patterns by assuming a constant δtmax i e constant thermal properties throughout the whole sapwood area eq 6 can be used to extend the granier method to different radial sap flow patterns in other words it is assumed that the temperature difference profile along the radius attains its maximum at the internal sapwood area where zero flux conditions actually take place without the restriction of zero night time sap flow regalado and ritter 2007 moreover it is assumed here that the temperature difference δt between the heated and the reference probe varies along the radial direction of the trunk or of the branch according to a simple power law the latter was used because of its simplicity which has also made it widely considered in many other contexts e g to describe the pressure head flow rate relationship in drip laterals design baiamonte 2018 to describe the allometric scale in the hydraulic scaling of biophysical phenomena west et al 1999 or rainfall intensity duration frequency curves baiamonte and singh 2017 baiamonte 2019 the simple power law applied to the radial sap flow pattern is written in dimensional and dimensionless forms here respectively 7a δ t δ t min r m 1 7b δ t δ t max δ t r m 1 where δtmin is the minimum value of the temperature difference along the trunk radius i e δt at maximum sap flow density δt denotes the ratio δtmin δtmax r r rc is the distance between the measuring point and the trunk or branch centre r normalized with respect to trunk radius below the cambium r c and m1 is the power law shape factor 0 since ν increases with r if experimental pairs r δt are available m1 and δtmin i e δt can be determined through a linear regression of the corresponding logarithmic values as an example for a fixed δtmin 6 c and for different m1 values fig 2 a plots the temperature difference versus the normalized radius showing that for any m1 value for r approaching to one δt δtmin moreover the figure shows that the selected m1 values cover different δt profile shapes the assumption of eq 7b covers a multitude of δt profiles occurring in heat dissipation probe measurements and as will be shown makes it possible to characterize radial sap flow patterns according to the already defined two parameters with a clear physical meaning δt and m1 substituting eq 7b in eq 6 yields 8 ν c 1 δ t r m 1 δ t r m 1 k c δ t max δ t min r m 1 δ t min r m 1 k for the same m1 values used in fig 2a for c cg and k kg and as an example for a fixed δt 0 2 eq 8 is plotted in fig 2b indicating that using the power law to describe the δt profile makes it possible to reproduce a multitude of radial sfd patterns including the constant and the linear sfd profiles that are achieved for m1 0 and m1 0 66 respectively interestingly m1 0 dashed line corresponds to a uniform sfd over the whole sap flow area moreover fig 2b shows that for m1 0 66 the sfd profile is characterized by a concave shape whereas for m1 0 66 the sfd profile is characterized by a convex shape both shapes could be useful for reproducing experimental radial sap flow patterns ford et al 2004a berdanier et al 2016 by putting in eq 8 ν 0 and solving by r it is also possible to derive the normalized measuring point that corresponds to the zero flux condition r 0 9 r 0 1 δ t 1 m 1 whereas for r 1 eq 8 provides the maximum sfd ν max which under monotonically increasing sfd vs r could be attained at the cambium bush et al 2010 berdanier et al 2014 in order to derive the transpiration rate at the tree scale etree kg s 1 under the simplified assumption of radial symmetry and in order to account for the sfd variability versus the radial direction eq 8 has to be integrated 10 e t r e e 2 π r 1 r 2 v r d r 2 π r c 2 r 1 r 2 v r d r where r 1 and r 2 are the normalized nearest and the

es g variability four orders of magnitude including all the possible es g values according to m1 and δt parameters however the lowest range of δt corresponds to very high and unrealistic sfd fluxes which are quite far from the usual range as expected with increasing δt es g decreases approaching to the zero flux condition for δt 1 δtmin δtmax whereas for fixed δt es g increases with m1 showing the influence of the shape parameter m1 on es g which according to what would be expected is less and less evident for very high and very low δt values similar considerations are valid for fig 3b where the vertical axis is delimited to the most common transpiration rate values 1 1000 mm h 1 that are most likely to be useful for applications compared to that of fig 3a in both fig 3a and b eq 11b s delimitation of the real solutions domain expressed is also represented in conclusion the fusiform shape delimited by the curves displayed in these two figures cover the transpiration rate that could be expected for any tree species if exploring the r 1 r 2 domain as an example for an experimental sfd profile which will be considered in section 3 id 5 table 1 fig 4 illustrates the normalized measuring point corresponding to the zero flux condition r 0 the normalized nearest and farthest measurement points from the trunk centre r 1 and r 2 together with the monotonically increasing sfd profile abc eq 8 which was derived by ignoring the measurement point at r 3 r 2 1 ν3 in fact the latter occurrence requires further derivations for non monotonic radial sapflow patterns profile abe which will be considered in the next section eq 11a makes it possible to describe the transpiration rate for any monotonic radial sapflow pattern and for any domain delimited by r 1 and r 2 if r 1 and r 2 are located around the zero flux zone and around the cambium eq 11a provides a good approximation of the transpiration rate however if this condition does not occur eq 11a could underestimate the transpiration rate in this case a transpiration rate close to the actual one could be determined by extrapolating the sfd profile on both r 0 and r 2 1 sides towards this aim by putting the constraints r 1 r 0 eq 9 and r 2 1 in eq 11a es could be derived for the entire range r 0 1 see eq a 6 in appendix a 12 e s 2 c m 1 δ t 2 m 1 b δ t 2 m 1 k 1 k b 2 m 1 k 1 k where for this case the last term b in the right hand matches the complete beta function caylor and dragoni 2009 alvarado barrientos 2013 interestingly for a fixed c and k es calculated in the range r 0 1 only depends on m1 and δt 2 2 determining transpiration flux for non monotonic radial sapflow patterns eq 11a can only be used for monotonic radial sapflow patterns e g diffuse pore species non monotonic radial sapflow patterns can be considered by introducing two more simple cases in the first case if the farthest measurement points from the trunk centre r 2 is far from the cambium rather than extrapolating the monotonic sfd increase as for eq 11a a constant sfd was assumed in r 2 1 in the second case if experimental measurements show a sfd decrease in r 2 1 a theoretical linear decreasing sfd profile was taken into account these last two occurrences are also illustrated in fig 4 where the sfd profile abd and abe are plotted respectively deriving the transpiration rate solution by assuming a constant sfd in r 2 1 also makes it possible to study the influence of extrapolating the sfd profile in an es estimate according to the farthest measurement point from the trunk centre for r r 2 1 abd in fig 4 therefore for the abd profile illustrated in fig 4 the following solution for the transpiration rate was derived see appendix b 13 e s 2 c m 1 δ t 2 m 1 b r 2 m 1 δ t 2 m 1 k 1 k b 2 m 1 k 1 k c 1 δ t

decreases with the dimensionless radius accordingly the following solution for the transpiration rate was derived see appendix c 14 e s 2 c n δ t 2 n b r 2 n δ t 2 n k 1 k b 2 n k 1 k 2 m 2 3 1 r 2 3 n 1 r 2 2 where m2 and n are the gradient and the ν intercept of the ν r line in the domain r 2 1 two cases can be distinguished when determining m2 and n depending on the availability of only one or more than one measurement point in the domain r 2 1 if only one sfd measurement in the r 2 1 domain is available meaning that only a pair r 3 ν 3 is known see fig 4 m2 and n can be easily calculated as 15 m 2 ν 2 ν 3 r 2 r 3 16 n r 2 ν 3 ν 2 r 3 r 2 r 3 where ν 2 and ν 3 are the transpiration fluxes corresponding to r 2 and r 3 respectively if more than one sfd measurement in the r 2 1 domain is available m2 can be calculated according to a simple constrained linear regression for the experimental pairs r r 2 ν ν 2 and by imposing n so that in r 2 the corresponding ν 2 value equals that calculated according to eq 8 17 n ν 2 m 2 r 2 c 1 δ t r 2 m 1 δ t r 2 n k m 2 r 2 3 deriving m1 and δt parameters from radial sap flow density measurements eq 8 can be used to extend our analysis to sfd profiles where actual δt data is not available since methods other than td such as hpv were used differently from what was observed in section 2 1 where the experimental pairs r δt were available eq 7b m1 and δt can be as well determined directly from sfd profile data by rearranging eq 8 18 r m 1 1 δ t 1 ν 1 k c 1 k taking the logarithm of both sides of eq 18 yields 19a m 1 ln r ln 1 δ t 1 ν 1 k c 1 k rearranging eq 19a once again gives the linear form 19b ln 1 ν 1 k c 1 k n 1 ln r ln δ t ln 1 ν 1 k c 1 k m 1 ln r ln δ t thus from the simple linear regression of the pairs ln r ln 1 ν1 k c 1 k m1 and δt can be determined it is interesting to observe that if the method used to detect radial sfd patterns differs from that of granier using eq 19b provides the same parameters m1 δt that would have been obtained if the granier method had been used 3 1 experimental literature data to test the proposed method the sfd measurements published by nadezhdina et al 2007 obtained in olive trees by the heat field deformation method hfd nadezhdina et al 1998 nadezhdina and čermák 2000 čermák et al 2004 nadezhdina et al 2006 were used as a dataset to derive the corresponding parameters m1 δt that would have been obtained under granier method eleven radial sap flow profiles with different shapes were selected from nadezhdina et al 2007 and the corresponding pairs r ν were obtained from the figures through digitizing engauge digitizer software mitchell et al 2019 an application was carried out in order to check the ability of eq 12 to calculate under the radial symmetry assumption the transpiration rate normalized with respect the cross sectional area es moreover 2 sfd profiles measured for peach trees gonzález altozano et al 2018 were also selected for a total of 13 sfd profiles table 1 towards this aim for the 13 selected sfd profiles table 1 reports the sap flow location measurements trunk or branch the trunk or branch radius rc mm the figure number corresponding to nadezhdina et al 2007 and gonzález altozano et al 2018 references m1 and δt calculated by fitting the linear regression of eq 19b and the normalized radius corresponding to the zero flux r 0 eq 9 in table 1 for all of the cases in which sfd profiles decrease along the radius in r r 2 1 sfd 1 5 8 9 10 and 11 the δt and m1 parameters which refer to the monotonic radial profile in r 0 1 eq 12 fig 4 abc were calculated by excluding the experimental pairs in r r 2 1 fig 5 graphs the experimental pairs r ν and the theoretical sfd expressed by eq 8 with the m1 and δt parameters reported in table 1 as can be observed in fig 5 eq 8 appears to suitably explain the investigated radial sfd patterns indeed the selected profiles cover different radial sfd patterns with different m1 values including the almost constant sfd corresponding to the id10 profile for which the shape parameters among those associated with the selected profiles table 1 equals the maximum value m1 0 091 which is close to zero constant sfd profile as mentioned above the aim of this application was also to detect the effect of extrapolating the sfd profile until the cambium or of assuming the sfd profile to be constant or decreasing from the furthest measurement from the centre trunk r r 2 to the cambium r 1 according to eqs 13 and 14 respectively for this purpose the ν value calculated at r 2 by eq 8 was assumed to be constant in r 2 1 for all of the considered 13 sfd profiles whereas the m2 and n parameters were only calculated for the radial sfd measurements id 1 5 8 9 10 and 11 fig 5a b d e where a decreasing sfd profile was observed in r 2 1 moreover for sfd profiles id 8 and 9 which had more than two measurements presenting a decreasing sfd in r 2 1 as observed above m2 was determined by linear regression whereas the n parameter was calculated by eq 17 for the remaining profiles with a decreasing sfd with only one measurement in r 2 1 m2 and n were calculated by eqs 15 and 16 respectively of course for sfd profiles id 2 3 4 6 7 12 and 13 sfd was observed to increase monotonically eq 14 was not applied and m2 and n were not estimated table 1 in table 1 the sfd profiles where m2 and n parameters were obtained by linear regression are indicated by a star symbol 4 results of the applications fig 6 a plots the 13 theoretical sfd profiles under the assumption of a monotonic radial sapflow pattern in r 0 1 indicating that they actually cover a variety of sfd shapes in agreement with the wide range of variability of the m1 parameter reported in table 1 0 892 0 091 in particular eq 8 also describes the sap flow profile id10 m1 0 091 well for which an almost constant sfd profile occurs until it approaches the case in which radial sfd variability is neglected ν constant however it might be easier to calculate the transpiration rate for this simple case according to es ν r 2 2 r 0 2 whereas the extended formulation is required for all of the others which refer to different radial sap flow patterns once the m1 and δt parameters have been estimated eq 7b makes it possible to derive the corresponding temperature difference profiles that would have been determined if the extended granier method had been used to determine the radial sfd patterns presented in this study the corresponding δt profiles are plotted in fig 6b showing that as expected for r 1 the ratio δt δtmin δtmax for each profile is achieved whereas δt 1 in r 0 table 1 for the sfd profiles described in section 3 in order to investigate the suitability of the derived solution to cope with both monotonic and non monotonic sfd profiles according to the different shapes that they may assume the transpiration rate was calculated by considering the following three radial patterns i monotonically increasing sfd in the domain r 0 1 eq 12 abc in fig 4 ii monotonically increasing sfd in the domain r 0 r 2 and constant sfd in r 2 1 eq 13 abd in fig 4 and iii monotonically increasing sfd in the domain r 0 r 2 and decreasing sfd in r 2 1 eq 14 abe in fig 4 fig 7 reports the estimates of es g according to eqs 12 14 for the three selected sfd profile shapes the transpiration rate can be observed to be in the range 50 320 mm h however the hypotheses assumed in eqs 12 14 have a certain influence on the computation of es g as expected differences in es g are linked to the values of the m1 parameter and to the location of the furthest measurement point r 2 see fig 4 for id 2 3 4 6 7 10 12 and 13 differences in the es g estimate appear small because of the high r 2 or m1 values which have a negligible effect on the extrapolation of the sfd to the cambium in particular the latter condition occurs for id 10 with a high m1 value m1 0 091 the greatest differences in calculating es g by extrapolating the sfd profile in r 2 1 eq 12 or by assuming the sfd in r 2 1 eq 13 to be constant can be observed for id 9 which is characterized by low m1 and r 2 values see table 1 for id 8 and 9 with a similar r 2 value differences in es g are also due to the different m2 values that shows more abrupt decrease in sfd for id 9 than id 8 as can be observed in fig 5d in conclusion when sfd measurements do not cover the entire radial sap flow pattern r 2 1 and when the m1 shape factor is low using eq 12 could overestimate the transpiration rate and thus might not be recommended the use of eq 13 which assumes the sfd to be constant from the furthest point measurement to the cambium could be a good compromise between extrapolating the sfd profile in r 2 1 eq 12 and calculating the transpiration rate with eq 14 especially if the sfd decrease in r 2 1 is not supported by an adequate number of observations on the contrary a monotonically increasing sfd profile eq 12 should be preferred if the range of measurements cover the area from the sapwood until the cambium especially for low m1 values with the advantage of describing the transpiration flux with only two parameters m1 and δt moreover with respect to eq 13 and to eq 14 eq 12 could be more advantageous when applied in a wider context and when the transpiration rate has to be upscaled in fact in order to calculate es g eq 12 only requires the two parameters m1 and δt which could be associated with the crop age and with the species characteristic to arrive at an indirect es g estimation in other words the availability of a very wide numbers of sfd profiles or of temperature difference profiles which both make it possible to derive m1 and δt parameters could help delimit the es g domain under reference environmental conditions suggesting an indirect criteria to derive es g in order to locate the selected 13 sfd profiles in the es g δt plane for the case of monotonic radial sapflow patterns eq 12 is graphed in fig 8 for fixed m1 values in the same figure the calculated es g values are plotted for the 13 sfd profiles notwithstanding the fact that sfd measurements are limited to only two species olive id 1 11 and peach id 12 13 the points cover a wide es g δt domain as a consequence of the high variability in the selected sfd profiles probably characterized by different observation times and soil moisture conditions moreover measurements that are often taken under different azimuthal positions and climate conditions nadezhdina et al 2002 may also affect es g and δt variability these results indicate the need to establish standard environmental conditions including soil moisture content sampling time stand age establishing a fixed experimental setup that could lead to locate in the es g δt plane the transpiration rate domains corresponding to different species towards extending the potential evapotranspiration concept which is also defined under reference conditions to the sole transpiration component of the water mass balance 5 conclusions an analytical approach extending the granier method to radial sap flow density sfd patterns showing high flexibility with parameters with a clear physical meaning is suggested the proposed procedure made it possible to develop a general framework to analyse different radial sfd patterns with an increasing number of parameters depending on the sfd profile complexity these parameters were able to synthetically describe the transpiration flux es of different tree species for the simplest case with a monotonically increasing sfd which could be assumed for diffuse porous tree structure only two distinctly physical parameters are required the ratio between the minimum and the maximum temperature difference δt and a shape factor m1 which could be derived by sfd profiles measured by methods other than granier therefore the proposed procedure could be suitable as a meta analysis tool for homogenizing sfd profiles of different species by means of δt and m1 parameters irrespective of the measurement method used the totality of transpiration flux conditions are constrained within a fusiform plane es δt delimited by the analytical solutions derived thus covering the transpiration flux that could be expected for any tree species the high variability of the transpiration flux located in the es δt plane and that of the corresponding m1 and δt parameters which was observed for two different species olive and peach trees suggested that fixing experimental setup associated with standard environmental conditions could lead to locate in the es δt plane according to m1 and δt more restricted transpiration rate domains corresponding to different species towards extending the potential evapotranspiration concept to the sole transpiration component of the water mass balance declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the contribution to the manuscript has to be shared between authors as follows

10708,reclamation of saline sodic soils for agricultural and vegetation ecological establishment is an important way to solve food and environmental problems especially in developing countries a water salt regulation method using scheduled drip irrigation to control the soil matric potential smp at a depth of 0 2 m immediately under drip emitters was proposed and the application effect of the method applied in field experiments was evaluated for reclamation of saline sodic wasteland at five sites with different climates land use objectives and planting patterns a low salinity environment was created in the whole soil profile especially in the root zone and the salt leaching process was divided into three stages rapid desalination slow desalination and salt stabilization the soil environment was improved with reclamation time resulting in improved land productivity crop yields at levels close to those in local farmland after 2 3 years and good landscape vegetation ecosystems were created by establishment of artificial vegetation and natural germination of seeds in the soil seed bank soil alkalization should receive some attention during the salt leaching process because it may affect the growth of acid loving plants in addition the low survival rates for salt sensitive non salt tolerant landscape plants in the early reclamation period led to the creating a non saline soil environment by adding non saline soils into planting holes overall the water salt regulation method to control smp immediately under scheduled drip irrigation emitters is suited for saline sodic soils restoration and some suggestions were proposed for its better application according to the field experiments keywords saline sodic soils drip irrigation smp salt leaching land productivity 1 introduction saline and sodic soils cover about 10 of the world s total arable land and exist in more than 100 countries salt affected soils are not limited to semi arid and arid regions in several other regions the climate and mobility of salts seasonally produce saline water and soil wesley and tanji 2012 moreover with the development of irrigation agriculture soil salinization in farmland is increasingly serious and is a challenge to sustaining productivity for future centuries soil salinity above a certain level has adverse effects on soil structure and plant growth and these differ with composition and concentration accumulation of dispersive cations such as sodium na on the exchange phase affects soil physical properties such as destabilization of soil structure deterioration of soil hydraulic properties increased susceptibility to crusting and imbalances of plant available nutrients in soil akhter et al 2004 li et al 2015 prichard et al 1985 salinity alters plant growth mainly by osmotic and specific ion toxicity effects and by changing the physical properties of soils and this in turn affects production of crops and growth of landscape plants thus low rates of or no seedling emergence little or no production and low survival rates or poor growth occur in saline sodic soils and result in land degradation ecological fragility and social poverty liu et al 2012 sun et al 2012 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 reclamation of affected soils can reduce natural hazards and provide a stable background for intensive cropping and vegetation ecology construction leaching is the usual way to reclaim salt affected soils because plant uptake removes insignificant amounts of salt the extent of leaching required greatly depends on initial soil salinity depth of the water table and especially needs to be combined with plant characteristics salt tolerance of plant and planting purposes to decide whether to wash the salt thoroughly or maintain a suitable soil water salinity environment for a certain period wesley and tanji 2012 for perennial plants crops the prevailing idea is to leach all excess salts from the whole soil profile especially from the entire root zone or to reduce salinity in the root zone below the threshold values of the crops plants for annual plants crops it is feasible to control salinity such that it does not affect them during their reproductive period leaching methods include continuous ponding intermittent ponding sprinkling drip irrigation alternate row or border leaching and surface flushing reclamation under an unsaturated soil moisture flow has been demonstrated to save more water and be more effective in leaching than saturated moisture flow selassie et al 1992 drip irrigation as a type of micro irrigation system has been found highly useful for utilization and reclamation of saline soils kang et al 2012 liu et al 2012 sun et al 2012 wan et al 2012 if properly designed it can minimize salinity and matric stresses because the soil water content is maintained at a high level and soil salts are leached to the perimeter of the wetted volume where rooting activity is minimal wesley and tanji 2012 drip irrigation began its development in the early 1960 s it has the potential to save water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants either from above the soil surface or buried below the surface moreover it can apply water precisely and uniformly at high frequencies producing an unsaturated soil moisture flow maintaining high soil matric potential smp in the root zone and thus compensating for the decreased osmotic potential caused by salinity and constant high total water potential can be maintained for crop and plant growth goldberg et al 1976 ayars et al 2001 li et al 2015 drip irrigation was first applied in salt leaching in the 1970 s in israel with the aggravation of water shortage and the development of modern agriculture drip irrigation has been more and more widely applied and china and india were the fastest expanding countries in the field of drip irrigation while drip irrigation is a systematic project in which soil crop water quality hydrogeology and other aspects should be considered comprehensively if not secondary salinization could occur due to unsuitable design such as emitter discharge rate spacing of emitters and of drip tape how much water should be applied and when to irrigate nakayama and bucks 1986 high build up of salts has been reported in the fringe of wetted areas in some studies and this may eventually become a problem for farmland wesley and tanji 2012 irrigation management is of prime importance in control of salinity and the amount and timing of water applications should be carefully controlled to achieve high crop yield and water use efficiency especially in saline soils irrigation should be implemented so as to maximize soil water potential thereby minimizing the effects of salinity on soil water availability and to minimize deep percolation thereby minimizing drainage and pollution problems when using drip irrigation for salt leaching the common method to obtain the irrigation amount is to determine the leaching requirement lr which needs many parameters such as the salt tolerance of plant however the salt tolerance of plant is affected by soil texture farming methods agronomic measures crop varieties climate plant growth period and other factors thus the value of lr varied with these factors li and kang 2019 the determination of irrigation time is mainly based on the monitored soil water content currently but the impact of the other soil properties such as soil salinity on the irrigation time is not reflected nakayama and bucks 1986 li and kang 2019 in recent years a method of water salt regulation in drip irrigation that controls the smp at a depth of 0 2 m immediately under drip emitters for saline sodic restoration has been proposed and improved by the author s team and field experiments on reclamation of saline sodic wasteland with five smp treatments 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa using the method were carried out at five sites with different climates fig 1 land use objectives and planting patterns the main objectives of the paper are to 1 systematically introduce the method of water salt regulation for scheduled drip irrigation 2 evaluate the application effect of the method in salt leaching water saving and land productivity in five kinds of saline sodic soils taking 5 kpa treatment value is suggested in the early reclamation period due to rapid salt leaching effect as example and 3 propose some suggestions for better application of the method of water salt regulation 2 method of water salt regulation using drip irrigation the concept of water salt regulation mainly involves maintaining a suitable soil environment through regulation of soil moisture and salinity sufficient to produce good growth and or higher yield rather than requiring complete leaching of soil salinity and the different progressive regions in soil salinity over time under drip irrigation is shown in fig 2 the method of water salt regulation using drip irrigation includes three key technical parameters design of the drip irrigation system irrigation scheduling and the mode of water salt regulation 2 1 drip irrigation system drip irrigation system parameters should be optimally designed which mainly includes emitter discharge rate and spacing of emitters and of drip tape to result in unsaturated soil moisture discharge rate and spacing of emitters can be determined according to chen et al 2015 based on the linear relationship between emitter discharge rate and steady state ponding area radius spacing of drip tape is determined according to the utilization purpose for saline land and can be initially laid as one row of tape for each row of cultivated crop and gradually adjusted for re vegetation reference to the determination method proposed by li et al 2015 2 2 drip irrigation scheduling drip irrigation scheduling comprises when and how much irrigation water to apply for the proposed method of water salt regulation using drip irrigation one vacuum gauge tensiometer is installed 0 2 m exactly underneath one emitter located in the center of a plot tensiometers are observed daily and irrigation applied when the tensiometer reading exceeds the target smp value in the early period of reclamation smp value above 5 kpa is suggested and it can be lowered with time and reduction in soil salinity an optimal value is determined according to the goal of higher crop production and or good plant growth as soil salinity decreases to mild or non saline irrigation water depth for each irrigation event should consider the ability of the soil to retain moisture and the maximum daily evapotranspiration of crops plants in the local area and irrigation water quality should also be taken into account 2 3 mode of water salt regulation soil salinity management differs according to the goal of reclaiming the saline land and has two modes of water salt regulation for annual crops soil salinity should be leached out of the main root zone and a lower soil salinity environment was maintained during the growth period soil salinity was not need to be completely leached away but is determined according to the cost and the crop growth period for perennial crops especially landscape plants soil salinity should be leached out completely changing saline especially severely saline soils to mild even non saline for sustainable re vegetation and reconstruction 3 application examples 3 1 site descriptions the impact of water salt regulation using drip irrigation on saline sodic soils was investigated in field experiments

years for the reclamation of saline sodic soils for annual crops perennial crops and cultivated landscape plants 1 an experiment to induce emergence of puccinellia tenuiflora under flat planting in degraded saline sodic soils was carried out in da an during 2008 2010 for the purpose of grassland restoration drip tape with emitter spacing of 0 2 m and average flow rate of 0 51 l h was placed with

during 2009 2011 for the purpose of re vegetation drip tape with emitter spacing of 0 2 m and average flow rate of 0 62 l h was placed with 0 6 m between drip tapes for all the conducted experiments at different sites one vacuum gauge tensiometer was installed 0 2 m exactly underneath one emitter located in the center of the plot the tensiometers were observed daily and irrigation applied when the tensiometer reading exceeded the target smp value field experiments in each site included five smp treatments 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa in this study salt leaching water saving and land productivity were evaluated and analyzed just for 5 kpa treatment the vacuum gauge tensiometer was buried in non saline soil to eliminate the influence of changes in soil osmotic potential caused by soil salinity on monitoring of smp fig 3 irrigation water salinity eciw was all 1 ds m except for xidatan site with eciw 2 14 ds m table 3 irrigation water sources were surface water in qingtongxia and karamay and groundwater in da an xidatan and dagang irrigation water depth for each irrigation event at all experimental sites allowed for the capacity of soil to retain moisture and the maximum daily

automatic weather stations vantagepro2 davis instruments hayward ca usa at the five sites and irrigation water amount was measured each year during the experimental period soil was sampled using an auger 2 0 cm diameter 15 cm high to determine soil salinity and ph samples were obtained at 0 10 20 30 and 40 cm from the emitters and sample depths were 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 and

profile identified as soil up to about 40 cm horizontally away from the emitter at depth 0 120 cm were calculated using the weighted average method dou et al 2011 coverage of p tenuiflora was measured using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor usa at the end of each year in da an mature fruit of lycium barbarum was manually harvested in xidatan at intervals of 7 days and after sun drying the cumulative quantity of dried fruit was recorded the seed cotton was picked by hand at 4 7 day intervals in karamay and the total weight per plot was calculated at each harvest time the survival rate for landscape plants was investigated in qingtongxia and dagang 3 4 statistical analyses one function was used to describe soil salinity while subject to increasing amount of irrigation water li and kang 2019 the model follows 1 y a 1 exp k x xc where y is desalting rate x is the amount of irrigation water applied in the experimental period in mm xc represents the inflection point of the equation a is the maximum value of y and k is the steepness of the equation all data were recorded and classified in microsoft office excel 2007 the figures of changes of soil salinity and soil ph with reclamation times and desalting rate with irrigation water amount were created using origin 8 0 origin lab inc northampton ma usa 4 results 4 1 rainfall and irrigation the precipitation and irrigation amount during the experimental period at all sites are shown in table 4 different climatic conditions and geographical locations resulted in different rainfall distributions the greatest annual average precipitation was 556 mm for dagang followed by da an xidatan qingtongxia and karamay with 159 142 129 and 98 mm respectively there was high interannual variation of rainfall in da an with 50 mm through the entire experimental period and in dagang with 230 mm in the first two years of the experiment the variations in precipitation for xidatan karamay and qingtongxia were 30 mm irrigation is affected not only by climate but also by the crop plant although the smp threshold values for all sites were set at 5 kpa irrigation amounts differed due to different rainfall and crop plant conditions the largest annual average irrigation amount was 762 mm for qingtongxia followed by karamay dagang xidatan and da an with 652 313 262 and 193 mm respectively great interannual variation of irrigation amount occurred for da an xidatan and qingtongxia with 60 mm especially in the last two years of the experiment for da an and xidatan with 180 mm there was 50 mm variation in irrigation amount for karamay and dagang but 90 mm occurred in the last two years for dagang ratio of irrigation amount to rainfall i r was used to evaluate the influence of irrigation on salt leaching it also reflected the impact of climate on irrigation and its potential impact on salt leaching the lowest i r value of 0 6 was obtained in dagang and the greatest of 6 6 was for karamay which had the highest and lowest rainfall during the experimental period respectively values of i r of 1 2 and 1 8 were obtained in da an and xidatan respectively and a higher i r of 5 9 occurred in qingtongxia with nearly the same precipitation as da an and xidatan 4 2 ece the changes of ece in 0 40 and 0 120 cm soil profiles for each experimental site are shown in fig 4 the average ece values in 0 40 cm soil were 4 30 2 95 5 77 0 94 and 3 90 ds m at the end of experimental period in sites 1 5 respectively representing decreases of 76 76 75 23 71 58 88 40 and 85 62 compared with initial values average ece values in 0 120 cm soil were 1 52 4 13 8 76 1 89 and 8 17 ds m at the end of the experiment in sites 1 5 respectively and decreased by 90 30 53 60 64 29 80 75 and 68 04 compared with initial values similar decreasing trends occurred at all sites during the salt leaching process the salt leaching process could be divided into rapid and slow desalination stages especially in da an and qingtongxia obvious salt accumulation just occurred in root zone especially in whole soil profile in karamay which was the only experimental area where annual cotton was grown a degree of salt accumulation in the root zone is acceptable for water salt regulation of annual crops because soil salinity can be leached and a suitable lower salinity environment can be rapidly created by drip irrigation before cotton emergence following planting soil ece in the root zone was 4 3 ds m at the end of the experiment at all sites except karamay salinity in the root zone changed to mild or non saline which was suitable for growth of salt sensitive and non salt tolerant plants the changes in soil salinity tended to be stable for xidatan and qingtongxia declined for da an and dagang and fluctuated for karamay 4 3 soil ph the change of ph in 0 40 and 0 120 cm soil profile for each site is shown in fig 5 average ph values in 0 40 cm soil were 9 30 7 92 6 99 8 29 and 8 51 at the end of the experimental period in sites 1 5 respectively and decreased by 7 92 14 66 6 92 9 66 and 6 38 compared with initial values average ph values in 0 120 cm soil were 7 90 8 52 7 17 8 19 and 8 37 at the end of the experiment in sites 1 5 respectively and decreased by 17 71 9 17 5 41 7 20 and 3 33 compared with initial values soil ph in the root zone and the whole soil profile decreased with time in da an however ph initially increased and then decreased in xidatan and karamay showing that soil alkalization occurred in the early stage of salt leaching for qingtongxia and dagang soil ph increased with time soil ph values were all 8 5 in the root zone and the whole soil profile at the end of the experiment at all sites expect da an which was already within a suitable range for most crop plant growth for da an although soil ph in root zone was 9 during the experiment the decline from 10 1 9 3 created a suitable environment for emergence of p tenuiflora 4 4 crop yield landscape plant survival soil salinity decreased significantly with drip irrigation with time and thus the soil environment improved which was reflected by the response of crops plants cultivated in saline sodic soils table 5 the area in da an was grassland before degradation and the main natural species was leymus chinensis with coverage of around 90 the p tenuiflora seeds in initial soil germinated and emerged under reclamation of saline sodic grassland using drip irrigation and with coverage of 74 and 82 in the 2d and 3d year of reclamation respectively which was close to the previous natural coverage of leymus chinensis the yield of lycium barbarum cultivated in takyric solonetz in xidatan obviously increased with values of 45 458 and 752 kg ha for 1 3 years of reclamation respectively and yield in the third year was 84 of the level of high yield using drip irrigation for local non saline farmland the yield of cotton cultivated in saline wasteland in karamay also obviously increased with values of 0 96 and 1 37 mg ha for 1 2 years of reclamation respectively and yield in the second year was 84 of the level of high yield using drip irrigation for local non saline farmland for vegetation and restoration in saline soils in qingtongxia and dagang survival rates for plants were 60 in qingtongxia with higher survival rates of populus canadensis moench and amorpha fruticosa linn of 97 6 and 100 respectively while significantly different survival rates occurred in dagang ligustrum lucidum and buxus microphylla had 96 5 and 97 0 respectively and no plants of rosa chinensis and prunus cerasifera survived overall land productivity and vegetation landscape ecology were significantly improved by reclamation of saline soils using drip irrigation fig 6 with yield and vegetation coverage clearly increasing 5 discussion 5 1 salt leaching using drip irrigation salt leaching is a common practice for reclaiming saline sodic land jury et al 1979 and is also considered to be a core technology because soil salt is leached from upper to lower soil depths or out of the root zone which solves the problem of salinity by quantitative change combination of irrigation and drainage is an important traditional salt leaching method with the development of irrigation technology salt leaching by irrigation includes continuous ponding of water partial ponding of water and unsaturated soil moisture flow induced by micro irrigation li et al 2015 in the present study soil salinity clearly decreased in the different climatic and soil type conditions using drip irrigation especially in the early period of reclamation all initial saline soils changed from severely or moderately saline to mild or non saline soil soil salinity accumulation just occurred in karamay with a planting pattern of annual cotton while it allowed for water salt regulation because accumulated salinity could be leached out of shallow soil and a suitable environment for seed germination was quickly created with drip irrigation wang et al 2011 previous studies reported that a high build up of salts in the fringe of the wetted area can eventually become a problem under drip irrigation wesley and tanji 2012 however in our study desalination occurred throughout the whole soil profile and no salt accumulation occurred in the fringe of the wetted area especially in the horizontal direction which may be due to continuous leaching of salt in the vertical direction after adjacent wetting fronts overlapped fig 2 moreover this can be attributed to the water salt regulation method for scheduled drip irrigation to control smp of 5 kpa higher than the value of field water holding capacity at a depth of 0 2 m immediately under a drip emitter which led to continuous water movement and salt leaching first in the horizontal and vertical directions and then in the vertical direction after the wetting fronts overlapped fig 2 irrigation was applied when tensiometer values fell below the set target smp of 5 kpa this target value was greater than the corresponding values of smp for field capacity thus causing a vertical downward soil water potential gradient and resulting in salt leaching with the reduction of soil salinity and improvement of soil environment the smp target value of 5 kpa may not be suitable for high crop production or landscape plant growth such as that higher survival rates and yields of lycium barbarum occurred under smp of 15 to 20 kpa in xidatan zhang et al 2013 it can be attributed to two reasons one is that greater applied water amounts under higher smp controlled will lead to the deterioration of soil aeration condition causing a negative influence on the crop growth the other is that the weak water logging tolerance of the plant might inhibit plant growth after salt injury had been relieved accordingly a lower smp value could be controlled with the reduction of soil salinity and improvement of soil environment according to the plant characteristics ions especially those that easily migrate were leached with wetting front movement resulting in reductions in na and then sar and thus led to change in soil chemical properties soil ph initially increased and then decreased in xidatan and karamay and in qingtongxia and dagang initially increased and was then stable soil alkalization occurred at four sites due to declines in soil salinity soil ph values increased from 7 5 to around 8 in qingtongxia and corresponding values increased from 8 to around 8 5 in dagang which may have affected the growth of acid loving landscape plants thus liquid acids such as industrial crude phosphoric acid could be applied through the drip irrigation system to maintain suitable soil acidity and alkalinity for plant growth li et al 2016 5 2 water amount for salt leaching salt leaching is a comprehensive and complex process and is affected by soil type initial soil salinity climate plant type and other factors the deeper the soil layer is the more influencing factors there are especially for spatial variability of soil and groundwater level in the present study the salt leaching process with increased amounts of irrigation water was analyzed using a logistic equation applied to the root zone because the influence of irrigation on salt leaching is greater in a shallow soil profile fig 7 with increasing amounts of irrigation water under the method of water salt regulation in this study soil salinity decreased and the desalination process was divided into three stages rapid desalination slow desalination and stable salinity fig 7 it may look like that the desalination process for the sites of 1 2 and 4 had two stages of rapid and stable stages compared with that of sites of 3 and 5 the reason is that the desalination process for the sites of 1 2 and 4 is too short if the curves of the sites of 1 2 and 4 are individually enlarged in the abscissa of 0 300 mm the three stages can be clearly seen 35 45 of desalination rates as the inflection point from rapid desalination to slow desalination was obtained for five experimental sites which indicated that the salt leaching rate slowed after about a one third reduction in soil salinity the fitted curves for da an xidatan and qingtongxia changed sharply however those for karamay and dagang were relatively smooth and these two sites had the lowest and highest annual rainfall respectively for karamay although there was more annual irrigation with 652 mm table 3 most of the irrigation water was absorbed by cotton and evaporated from the soil surface due to less rainfall and the arid climate for dagang although there was more annual precipitation with 556 mm a higher groundwater level of 0 5 1 2 m during the experiment may have led to the slow salt leaching the fitted curve equations showed that the stable values of salinity all tended to be 6 ds m for the five sites table 6 further demonstrating the salt leaching effect of drip irrigation to decrease salinity by 1 ds m required 9 24 75 20 and 60 mm of irrigation water for sites 1 5 respectively more irrigation water depth was needed for karamay and dagang which had the least and most rainfall respectively to achieve 70 desalination in the 0 40 cm soil profile required 200 mm of irrigation water for sites other than karamay and dagang with 638 and 385 mm respectively the calculated water consumption of cotton is around 600 mm based on the water balance method wang et al 2011 indicating that most of the irrigation water was absorbed by plants crops the amount of water required is nearly the same per unit depth of saline soil reclaimed without plants crops for both ponding and sprinkling prichard et al 1985 indicating that reclamation of saline wasteland using drip irrigation to control smp was more efficient for salt leaching and more importantly that less water was required to achieve the same degree of reclamation this was mainly because unsaturated soil water flow is more effective and saves water compared to saturated flow li et al 2015 prichard et al 1985 for the method of water salt regulation using drip irrigation in this study drip irrigation started based on smp and higher smp was controlled in the early reclamation period to cause a vertical downward soil water potential gradient which led to the downward movement of soil salinity and resulting in the desalination occurring throughout the whole soil profile for each irrigation event 5 10 mm of water and the calculated fertilizer were applied which can realize salt leaching as well as water and fertilizer supply for plants at the same time however more water was applied for conventional drip irrigation for each irrigation event which was determined by lr or based on the experience of surface irrigation for example more than 1000 mm water was applied for the cotton using conventional drip irrigation wang et al 2011 which is much higher than the value of 600 mm in this study using the method of water salt regulation during the reclamation of the saline soils in karamay more water at each irrigation event can lead to more deep percolation then result in the rising of groundwater table and occurrence of secondary salinization which has been reported in xinjiang province in china wang et al 2011 moreover the unsaturated soil water flow is more effective in salt leaching compared with the saturated flow so the water amount applied for each irrigation event should not be too much overall the desalination caused by the method of water salt regulation using drip irrigation in this study is due to the control of smp and the irrigation was implemented with small water amount for each irrigation event and high frequency 5 3 land productivity the suitability of a soil for cropping depends greatly on the degree to which it conducts water nutrients air and heat and on physical properties that control friability of the seedbed higher na in saline soil can result in changes in exchangeable and soil solution ions and soil ph destabilization of soil structure deterioration of soil hydraulic properties increased susceptibility to crusting and imbalances in plant available nutrients akhter et al 2004 khoshgoftarmanesh et al 2003 prichard et al 1985 qadir and oster 2002 excess salt reduces soil permeability and thus total soil water potential which increases the energy that plants must expend to acquire water from soil and leads to difficulties in root water uptake with the decrease in water absorption nutrient uptake also decreases and because of imbalance of ion absorption due to excess salt an imbalanced or inadequate supply of plant nutrients occurs and thus plants are difficult to germinate or grow poorly plant response to salinity varies with many factors including climate soil conditions agronomic practices irrigation management crop variety stage of growth and salt composition wesley and tanji 2012 however for improving land productivity salt leaching is most important in the present study a low salt environment was quickly created under drip irrigation with the leaching of na the sar li et al 2015 and soil bulk density liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 decrease and soil field capacity liu et al 2012 sun et al 2012 infiltration rate sun et al 2012 soil microorganisms liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 soil enzyme activities and soil organic matter wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 increase which result in a suitable environment for plant growth the increase of drip irrigation with time results in an increasing yield and vigorous growth in field conditions in the present study soil alkalization occurred for saline soils which may affect acid loving plants and this may also be the reason for the low survival rate of some landscape plants in qingtongxia and dagang sites thus regulation of acidity and alkalinity by adding liquid acids to drip irrigation systems is proposed most plants are relatively salt tolerant during germination and are more sensitive during seedling emergence and early growth stages wesley and tanji 2012 and this is the reason that grasslands have degraded in da an on the songnen plain with the leaching of salt and improving of the soil environment the conditions required for seed germination and seedling growth of p tenuiflora were achieved using drip irrigation hence it is imperative to maintain low salinity in the seedbed after germination and create a suitable growth environment for salt sensitive or salt tolerant plants by filling planting holes with non saline soil to avoid high soil salinity during the early period of reclamation after 2 3 years of reclamation and utilization the yields of crops were close to levels of high yield using drip irrigation for local non saline farmland and good landscape vegetation ecosystems were created fig 6 in this study although the crop yield results were just analyzed for 5 kpa treatment yield close to or even higher than the levels in local non saline farmland using drip irrigation after 2 years was obtained for smp of 5 kpa treatments data not shown wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 this indicated that the method could provide suitable conditions for crops and achieve high yield in reclamation of saline sodic soil 5 4 some suggestions for the application of the water salt regulation method in the present study some suggestions were given for the application of the water salt regulation method based on the comprehensive analysis of field experiment results at five sites 1 it is effective for saline sodic restoration by controlling the smp at a depth of 0 2 m immediately under drip emitters and 5 kpa is suggested as the target smp value in early reclamation period and then the target smp value can be controlled lower with the decreasing soil salinity combined with a comprehensive consideration of water saving and high yield 5 10 mm of water can be applied for each irrigation event which can realize the salt leaching meet plant demand for water and save water resources due to less deep percolation rainwater can be utilized in regions with rich rainfall 2 ridge planting is suggested as one agronomic practice to lower groundwater table which is very important for regions with high groundwater table as well as for the perennial plant planted in arid and semi arid area ridge height and width can be determined by the groundwater table and plant crop type for arbor planting the ridge surface should be at least 1 3 1 5 m away from the groundwater table in addition mulching was suggested in crop planting in arid and semi arid area which can reduce the soil evaporation and inhibit salt accumulation in topsoil 6 conclusions drip irrigation was used in reclamation of saline soils differing in climates crop landscape plant species and planting pattern a low salinity environment was created in the whole soil profile especially in the root zone and the salt leaching process was divided into three stages rapid desalination slow desalination and salt stabilization the soil environment was improved with longer reclamation time and resulted in improved land productivity yields of crops that were close to the levels in local farmland after 2 3 years and good landscape vegetation ecosystems with establishment of artificial vegetation and natural germination of seeds in the soil seed bank soil alkalization should receive some attention during the salt leaching process as it may affect the growth of acid loving plants in addition the low survival rates for landscape plants that were salt sensitive non salt tolerant in the early reclamation period led to the proposal of creating a non saline soil environment by adding non saline soils into planting holes overall water salt regulation using scheduled drip irrigation to control the smp at a depth of 0 2 m immediately under drip emitters can be used for saline sodic restoration this can also effectively control rising groundwater levels and alleviate secondary salinization of irrigated farmland due to the characteristics of drip irrigation of high frequency and less water applied in each irrigation event

10708,reclamation of saline sodic soils for agricultural and vegetation ecological establishment is an important way to solve food and environmental problems especially in developing countries a water salt regulation method using scheduled drip irrigation to control the soil matric potential smp at a depth of 0 2 m immediately under drip emitters was proposed and the application effect of the method applied in field experiments was evaluated for reclamation of saline sodic wasteland at five sites with different climates land use objectives and planting patterns a low salinity environment was created in the whole soil profile especially in the root zone and the salt leaching process was divided into three stages rapid desalination slow desalination and salt stabilization the soil environment was improved with reclamation time resulting in improved land productivity crop yields at levels close to those in local farmland after 2 3 years and good landscape vegetation ecosystems were created by establishment of artificial vegetation and natural germination of seeds in the soil seed bank soil alkalization should receive some attention during the salt leaching process because it may affect the growth of acid loving plants in addition the low survival rates for salt sensitive non salt tolerant landscape plants in the early reclamation period led to the creating a non saline soil environment by adding non saline soils into planting holes overall the water salt regulation method to control smp immediately under scheduled drip irrigation emitters is suited for saline sodic soils restoration and some suggestions were proposed for its better application according to the field experiments keywords saline sodic soils drip irrigation smp salt leaching land productivity 1 introduction saline and sodic soils cover about 10 of the world s total arable land and exist in more than 100 countries salt affected soils are not limited to semi arid and arid regions in several other regions the climate and mobility of salts seasonally produce saline water and soil wesley and tanji 2012 moreover with the development of irrigation agriculture soil salinization in farmland is increasingly serious and is a challenge to sustaining productivity for future centuries soil salinity above a certain level has adverse effects on soil structure and plant growth and these differ with composition and concentration accumulation of dispersive cations such as sodium na on the exchange phase affects soil physical properties such as destabilization of soil structure deterioration of soil hydraulic properties increased susceptibility to crusting and imbalances of plant available nutrients in soil akhter et al 2004 li et al 2015 prichard et al 1985 salinity alters plant growth mainly by osmotic and specific ion toxicity effects and by changing the physical properties of soils and this in turn affects production of crops and growth of landscape plants thus low rates of or no seedling emergence little or no production and low survival rates or poor growth occur in saline sodic soils and result in land degradation ecological fragility and social poverty liu et al 2012 sun et al 2012 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 reclamation of affected soils can reduce natural hazards and provide a stable background for intensive cropping and vegetation ecology construction leaching is the usual way to reclaim salt affected soils because plant uptake removes insignificant amounts of salt the extent of leaching required greatly depends on initial soil salinity depth of the water table and especially needs to be combined with plant characteristics salt tolerance of plant and planting purposes to decide whether to wash the salt thoroughly or maintain a suitable soil water salinity environment for a certain period wesley and tanji 2012 for perennial plants crops the prevailing idea is to leach all excess salts from the whole soil profile especially from the entire root zone or to reduce salinity in the root zone below the threshold values of the crops plants for annual plants crops it is feasible to control salinity such that it does not affect them during their reproductive period leaching methods include continuous ponding intermittent ponding sprinkling drip irrigation alternate row or border leaching and surface flushing reclamation under an unsaturated soil moisture flow has been demonstrated to save more water and be more effective in leaching than saturated moisture flow selassie et al 1992 drip irrigation as a type of micro irrigation system has been found highly useful for utilization and reclamation of saline soils kang et al 2012 liu et al 2012 sun et al 2012 wan et al 2012 if properly designed it can minimize salinity and matric stresses because the soil water content is maintained at a high level and soil salts are leached to the perimeter of the wetted volume where rooting activity is minimal wesley and tanji 2012 drip irrigation began its development in the early 1960 s it has the potential to save water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants either from above the soil surface or buried below the surface moreover it can apply water precisely and uniformly at high frequencies producing an unsaturated soil moisture flow maintaining high soil matric potential smp in the root zone and thus compensating for the decreased osmotic potential caused by salinity and constant high total water potential can be maintained for crop and plant growth goldberg et al 1976 ayars et al 2001 li et al 2015 drip irrigation was first applied in salt leaching in the 1970 s in israel with the aggravation of water shortage and the development of modern agriculture drip irrigation has been more and more widely applied and china and india were the fastest expanding countries in the field of drip irrigation while drip irrigation is a systematic project in which soil crop water quality hydrogeology and other aspects should be considered comprehensively if not secondary salinization could occur due to unsuitable design such as emitter discharge rate spacing of emitters and of drip tape how much water should be applied and when to irrigate nakayama and bucks 1986 high build up of salts has been reported in the fringe of wetted areas in some studies and this may eventually become a problem for farmland wesley and tanji 2012 irrigation management is of prime importance in control of salinity and the amount and timing of water applications should be carefully controlled to achieve high crop yield and water use efficiency especially in saline soils irrigation should be implemented so as to maximize soil water potential thereby minimizing the effects of salinity on soil water availability and to minimize deep percolation thereby minimizing drainage and pollution problems when using drip irrigation for salt leaching the common method to obtain the irrigation amount is to determine the leaching requirement lr which needs many parameters such as the salt tolerance of plant however the salt tolerance of plant is affected by soil texture farming methods agronomic measures crop varieties climate plant growth period and other factors thus the value of lr varied with these factors li and kang 2019 the determination of irrigation time is mainly based on the monitored soil water content currently but the impact of the other soil properties such as soil salinity on the irrigation time is not reflected nakayama and bucks 1986 li and kang 2019 in recent years a method of water salt regulation in drip irrigation that controls the smp at a depth of 0 2 m immediately under drip emitters for saline sodic restoration has been proposed and improved by the author s team and field experiments on reclamation of saline sodic wasteland with five smp treatments 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa using the method were carried out at five sites with different climates fig 1 land use objectives and planting patterns the main objectives of the paper are to 1 systematically introduce the method of water salt regulation for scheduled drip irrigation 2 evaluate the application effect of the method in salt leaching water saving and land productivity in five kinds of saline sodic soils taking 5 kpa treatment value is suggested in the early reclamation period due to rapid salt leaching effect as example and 3 propose some suggestions for better application of the method of water salt regulation 2 method of water salt regulation using drip irrigation the concept of water salt regulation mainly involves maintaining a suitable soil environment through regulation of soil moisture and salinity sufficient to produce good growth and or higher yield rather than requiring complete leaching of soil salinity and the different progressive regions in soil salinity over time under drip irrigation is shown in fig 2 the method of water salt regulation using drip irrigation includes three key technical parameters design of the drip irrigation system irrigation scheduling and the mode of water salt regulation 2 1 drip irrigation system drip irrigation system parameters should be optimally designed which mainly includes emitter discharge rate and spacing of emitters and of drip tape to result in unsaturated soil moisture discharge rate and spacing of emitters can be determined according to chen et al 2015 based on the linear relationship between emitter discharge rate and steady state ponding area radius spacing of drip tape is determined according to the utilization purpose for saline land and can be initially laid as one row of tape for each row of cultivated crop and gradually adjusted for re vegetation reference to the determination method proposed by li et al 2015 2 2 drip irrigation scheduling drip irrigation scheduling comprises when and how much irrigation water to apply for the proposed method of water salt regulation using drip irrigation one vacuum gauge tensiometer is installed 0 2 m exactly underneath one emitter located in the center of a plot tensiometers are observed daily and irrigation applied when the tensiometer reading exceeds the target smp value in the early period of reclamation smp value above 5 kpa is suggested and it can be lowered with time and reduction in soil salinity an optimal value is determined according to the goal of higher crop production and or good plant growth as soil salinity decreases to mild or non saline irrigation water depth for each irrigation event should consider the ability of the soil to retain moisture and the maximum daily evapotranspiration of crops plants in the local area and irrigation water quality should also be taken into account 2 3 mode of water salt regulation soil salinity management differs according to the goal of reclaiming the saline land and has two modes of water salt regulation for annual crops soil salinity should be leached out of the main root zone and a lower soil salinity environment was maintained during the growth period soil salinity was not need to be completely leached away but is determined according to the cost and the crop growth period for perennial crops especially landscape plants soil salinity should be leached out completely changing saline especially severely saline soils to mild even non saline for sustainable re vegetation and reconstruction 3 application examples 3 1 site descriptions the impact of water salt regulation using drip irrigation on saline sodic soils was investigated in field experiments

years for the reclamation of saline sodic soils for annual crops perennial crops and cultivated landscape plants 1 an experiment to induce emergence of puccinellia tenuiflora under flat planting in degraded saline sodic soils was carried out in da an during 2008 2010 for the purpose of grassland restoration drip tape with emitter spacing of 0 2 m and average flow rate of 0 51 l h was placed with 0 8 m between drip tapes 2 an experiment of cultivating lycium barbarum l with ridge planting in takyric solonetz wasteland was carried out in xidatan during 2009 2011 for agricultural production drip tape with emitter spacing of 0 2 m and average flow rate of 0 76 l h was placed with 3 0 m between drip tapes 3 an experiment of cultivating cotton using ridge planting in saline wasteland was performed in karamay during 2009 2010 for the purpose of agricultural production drip tape with emitter spacing of 0 2 m and average flow rate of 0 53 l h was placed with 0 8 m between drip tapes 4 an experiment cultivating landscape plants using ridge planting in saline wasteland was carried out in qingtongxia during 2015 2016 for the purpose of re vegetation drip tape with emitter spacing of 0 3 m and average flow rate of 1 38 l h was placed at 0 6 m between drip tapes 5 an experiment of landscape plants cultivated under flat planting in coastal saline wasteland was carried out in dagang during 2009 2011 for the purpose of re vegetation drip tape with emitter spacing of 0 2 m and average flow rate of 0 62 l h was placed with 0 6 m between drip tapes for all the conducted experiments at different sites one vacuum gauge tensiometer was installed 0 2 m exactly underneath one emitter located in the center of the plot the tensiometers were observed daily and irrigation applied when the tensiometer reading exceeded the target smp value field experiments in each site included five smp treatments 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa in this study salt leaching water saving and land productivity were evaluated and analyzed just for 5 kpa treatment the vacuum gauge tensiometer was buried in non saline soil to eliminate the influence of changes in soil osmotic potential caused by soil salinity on monitoring of smp fig 3 irrigation water salinity eciw was all 1 ds m except for xidatan site with eciw 2 14 ds m table 3 irrigation water sources were surface water in qingtongxia and karamay and groundwater in da an xidatan and dagang irrigation water depth for each irrigation event at all experimental sites allowed for the capacity of soil to retain moisture and the maximum daily evapotranspiration of crops plants in the area in da an 3 5 mm of water was applied in each round of irrigation before p tenuiflora tillering and 7 mm after tillering as soon as smp dropped to 5 kpa the amounts of water were 5 10 10 and 10 mm for each irrigation event in xidatan karamay qingtongxia and dagang respectively table 4 3 3 observation and measurements precipitation was monitored by automatic weather stations vantagepro2 davis instruments hayward ca usa at the five sites and irrigation water amount was measured each year during the experimental period soil was sampled using an auger 2 0 cm diameter 15 cm high to determine soil salinity and ph samples were obtained at 0 10 20 30 and 40 cm from the emitters and sample depths were 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 and 100 120 cm the replicate soil samples were mixed into one sample all soil samples were air dried and passed through a 1 mm sieve soluble salts were estimated and soluble cations and soil ph determined using extracts of saturated soil the ec and ph were determined using a conductivity meter dds 11a rex shanghai china and a ph meter phs 3c rex respectively the sar of the saturated paste extract was calculated according to rhoades et al 1992 the average ece values in the mainly root zone identified as soil up to about 30 cm horizontally away from the emitter at depth 0 40 cm and whole soil profile identified as soil up to about 40 cm horizontally away from the emitter at depth 0 120 cm were calculated using the weighted average method dou et al 2011 coverage of p tenuiflora was measured using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor usa at the end of each year in da an mature fruit of lycium barbarum was manually harvested in xidatan at intervals of 7 days and after sun drying the cumulative quantity of dried fruit was recorded the seed cotton was picked by hand at 4 7 day intervals in karamay and the total weight per plot was calculated at each harvest time the survival rate for landscape plants was investigated in qingtongxia and dagang 3 4 statistical analyses one function was used to describe soil salinity while subject to increasing amount of irrigation water li and kang 2019 the model follows 1 y a 1 exp k x xc where y is desalting rate x is the amount of irrigation water applied in the experimental period in mm xc represents the inflection point of the equation a is the maximum value of y and k is the steepness of the equation all data were recorded and classified in microsoft office excel 2007 the figures of changes of soil salinity and soil ph with reclamation times and desalting rate with irrigation water amount were created using origin 8 0 origin lab inc northampton ma usa 4 results 4 1 rainfall and irrigation the precipitation and irrigation amount during the experimental period at all sites are shown in table 4 different climatic conditions and geographical locations resulted in different rainfall distributions the greatest annual average precipitation was 556 mm for dagang followed by da an xidatan qingtongxia and karamay with 159 142 129 and 98 mm respectively there was high interannual variation of rainfall in da an with 50 mm through the entire experimental period and in dagang with 230 mm in the first two years of the experiment the variations in precipitation for xidatan karamay and qingtongxia were 30 mm irrigation is affected not only by climate but also by the crop plant although the smp threshold values for all sites were set at 5 kpa irrigation amounts differed due to different rainfall and crop plant conditions the largest annual average irrigation amount was 762 mm for qingtongxia followed by karamay dagang xidatan and da an with 652 313 262 and 193 mm respectively great interannual variation of irrigation amount occurred for da an xidatan and qingtongxia with 60 mm especially in the last two years of the experiment for da an and xidatan with 180 mm there was 50 mm variation in irrigation amount for karamay and dagang but 90 mm occurred in the last two years for dagang ratio of irrigation amount to rainfall i r was used to evaluate the influence of irrigation on salt leaching it also reflected the impact of climate on irrigation and its potential impact on salt leaching the lowest i r value of 0 6 was obtained in dagang and the greatest of 6 6 was for karamay which had the highest and lowest rainfall during the experimental period respectively values of i r of 1 2 and 1 8 were obtained in da an and xidatan respectively and a higher i r of 5 9 occurred in qingtongxia with nearly the same precipitation as da an and xidatan 4 2 ece the changes of ece in 0 40 and 0 120 cm soil profiles for each experimental site are shown in fig 4 the average ece values in 0 40 cm soil were 4 30 2 95 5 77 0 94 and 3 90 ds m at the end of experimental period in sites 1 5 respectively representing decreases of 76 76 75 23 71 58 88 40 and 85 62 compared with initial values average ece values in 0 120 cm soil were 1 52 4 13 8 76 1 89 and 8 17 ds m at the end of the experiment in sites 1 5 respectively and decreased by 90 30 53 60 64 29 80 75 and 68 04 compared with initial values similar decreasing trends occurred at all sites during the salt leaching process the salt leaching process could be divided into rapid and slow desalination stages especially in da an and qingtongxia obvious salt accumulation just occurred in root zone especially in whole soil profile in karamay which was the only experimental area where annual cotton was grown a degree of salt accumulation in the root zone is acceptable for water salt regulation of annual crops because soil salinity can be leached and a suitable lower salinity environment can be rapidly created by drip irrigation before cotton emergence following planting soil ece in the root zone was 4 3 ds m at the end of the experiment at all sites except karamay salinity in the root zone changed to mild or non saline which was suitable for growth of salt sensitive and non salt tolerant plants the changes in soil salinity tended to be stable for xidatan and qingtongxia declined for da an and dagang and fluctuated for karamay 4 3 soil ph the change of ph in 0 40 and 0 120 cm soil profile for each site is shown in fig 5 average ph values in 0 40 cm soil were 9 30 7 92 6 99 8 29 and 8 51 at the end of the experimental period in sites 1 5 respectively and decreased by 7 92 14 66 6 92 9 66 and 6 38 compared with initial values average ph values in 0 120 cm soil were 7 90 8 52 7 17 8 19 and 8 37 at the end of the experiment in sites 1 5 respectively and decreased by 17 71 9 17 5 41 7 20 and 3 33 compared with initial values soil ph in the root zone and the whole soil profile decreased with time in da an however ph initially increased and then decreased in xidatan and karamay showing that soil alkalization occurred in the early stage of salt leaching for qingtongxia and dagang soil ph increased with time soil ph values were all 8 5 in the root zone and the whole soil profile at the end of the experiment at all sites expect da an which was already within a suitable range for most crop plant growth for da an although soil ph in root zone was 9 during the experiment the decline from 10 1 9 3 created a suitable environment for emergence of p tenuiflora 4 4 crop yield landscape plant survival soil salinity decreased significantly with drip irrigation with time and thus the soil environment improved which was reflected by the response of crops plants cultivated in saline sodic soils table 5 the area in da an was grassland before degradation and the main natural species was leymus chinensis with coverage of around 90 the p tenuiflora seeds in initial soil germinated and emerged under reclamation of saline sodic grassland using drip irrigation and with coverage of 74 and 82 in the 2d and 3d year of reclamation respectively which was close to the previous natural coverage of leymus chinensis the yield of lycium barbarum cultivated in takyric solonetz in xidatan obviously increased with values of 45 458 and 752 kg ha for 1 3 years of reclamation respectively and yield in the third year was 84 of the level of high yield using drip irrigation for local non saline farmland the yield of cotton cultivated in saline wasteland in karamay also obviously increased with values of 0 96 and 1 37 mg ha for 1 2 years of reclamation respectively and yield in the second year was 84 of the level of high yield using drip irrigation for local non saline farmland for vegetation and restoration in saline soils in qingtongxia and dagang survival rates for plants were 60 in qingtongxia with higher survival rates of populus canadensis moench and amorpha fruticosa linn of 97 6 and 100 respectively while significantly different survival rates occurred in dagang ligustrum lucidum and buxus microphylla had 96 5 and 97 0 respectively and no plants of rosa chinensis and prunus cerasifera survived overall land productivity and vegetation landscape ecology were significantly improved by reclamation of saline soils using drip irrigation fig 6 with yield and vegetation coverage clearly increasing 5 discussion 5 1 salt leaching using drip irrigation salt leaching is a common practice for reclaiming saline sodic land jury et al 1979 and is also considered to be a core technology because soil salt is leached from upper to lower soil depths or out of the root zone which solves the problem of salinity by quantitative change combination of irrigation and drainage is an important traditional salt leaching method with the development of irrigation technology salt leaching by irrigation includes continuous ponding of water partial ponding of water and unsaturated soil moisture flow induced by micro irrigation li et al 2015 in the present study soil salinity clearly decreased in the different climatic and soil type conditions using drip irrigation especially in the early period of reclamation all initial saline soils changed from severely or moderately saline to mild or non saline soil soil salinity accumulation just occurred in karamay with a planting pattern of annual cotton while it allowed for water salt regulation because accumulated salinity could be leached out of shallow soil and a suitable environment for seed germination was quickly created with drip irrigation wang et al 2011 previous studies reported that a high build up of salts in the fringe of the wetted area can eventually become a problem under drip irrigation wesley and tanji 2012 however in our study desalination occurred throughout the whole soil profile and no salt accumulation occurred in the fringe of the wetted area especially in the horizontal direction which may be due to continuous leaching of salt in the vertical direction after adjacent wetting fronts overlapped fig 2 moreover this can be attributed to the water salt regulation method for scheduled drip irrigation to control smp of 5 kpa higher than the value of field water holding capacity at a depth of 0 2 m immediately under a drip emitter which led to continuous water movement and salt leaching first in the horizontal and vertical directions and then in the vertical direction after the wetting fronts overlapped fig 2 irrigation was applied when tensiometer values fell below the set target smp of 5 kpa this target value was greater than the corresponding values of smp for field capacity thus causing a vertical downward soil water potential gradient and resulting in salt leaching with the reduction of soil salinity and improvement of soil environment the smp target value of 5 kpa may not be suitable for high crop production or landscape plant growth such as that higher survival rates and yields of lycium barbarum occurred under smp of 15 to 20 kpa in xidatan zhang et al 2013 it can be attributed to two reasons one is that greater applied water amounts under higher smp controlled will lead to the deterioration of soil aeration condition causing a negative influence on the crop growth the other is that the weak water logging tolerance of the plant might inhibit plant growth after salt injury had been relieved accordingly a lower smp value could be controlled with the reduction of soil salinity and improvement of soil environment according to the plant characteristics ions especially those that easily migrate were leached with wetting front movement resulting in reductions in na and then sar and thus led to change in soil chemical properties soil ph initially increased and then decreased in xidatan and karamay and in qingtongxia and dagang initially increased and was then stable soil alkalization occurred at four sites due to declines in soil salinity soil ph values increased from 7 5 to around 8 in qingtongxia and corresponding values increased from 8 to around 8 5 in dagang which may have affected the growth of acid loving landscape plants thus liquid acids such as industrial crude phosphoric acid could be applied through the drip irrigation system to maintain suitable soil acidity and alkalinity for plant growth li et al 2016 5 2 water amount for salt leaching salt leaching is a comprehensive and complex process and is affected by soil type initial soil salinity climate plant type and other factors the deeper the soil layer is the more influencing factors there are especially for spatial variability of soil and groundwater level in the present study the salt leaching process with increased amounts of irrigation water was analyzed using a logistic equation applied to the root zone because the influence of irrigation on salt leaching is greater in a shallow soil profile fig 7 with increasing amounts of irrigation water under the method of water salt regulation in this study soil salinity decreased and the desalination process was divided into three stages rapid desalination slow desalination and stable salinity fig 7 it may look like that the desalination process for the sites of 1 2 and 4 had two stages of rapid and stable stages compared with that of sites of 3 and 5 the reason is that the desalination process for the sites of 1 2 and 4 is too short if the curves of the sites of 1 2 and 4 are individually enlarged in the abscissa of 0 300 mm the three stages can be clearly seen 35 45 of desalination rates as the inflection point from rapid desalination to slow desalination was obtained for five experimental sites which indicated that the salt leaching rate slowed after about a one third reduction in soil salinity the fitted curves for da an xidatan and qingtongxia changed sharply however those for karamay and dagang were relatively smooth and these two sites had the lowest and highest annual rainfall respectively for karamay although there was more annual irrigation with 652 mm table 3 most of the irrigation water was absorbed by cotton and evaporated from the soil surface due to less rainfall and the arid climate for dagang although there was more annual precipitation with 556 mm a higher groundwater level of 0 5 1 2 m during the experiment may have led to the slow salt leaching the fitted curve equations showed that the stable values of salinity all tended to be 6 ds m for the five sites table 6 further demonstrating the salt leaching effect of drip irrigation to decrease salinity by 1 ds m required 9 24 75 20 and 60 mm of irrigation water for sites 1 5 respectively more irrigation water depth was needed for karamay and dagang which had the least and most rainfall respectively to achieve 70 desalination in the 0 40 cm soil profile required 200 mm of irrigation water for sites other than karamay and dagang with 638 and 385 mm respectively the calculated water consumption of cotton is around 600 mm based on the water balance method wang et al 2011 indicating that most of the irrigation water was absorbed by plants crops the amount of water required is nearly the same per unit depth of saline soil reclaimed without plants crops for both ponding and sprinkling prichard et al 1985 indicating that reclamation of saline wasteland using drip irrigation to control smp was more efficient for salt leaching and more importantly that less water was required to achieve the same degree of reclamation this was mainly because unsaturated soil water flow is more effective and saves water compared to saturated flow li et al 2015 prichard et al 1985 for the method of water salt regulation using drip irrigation in this study drip irrigation started based on smp and higher smp was controlled in the early reclamation period to cause a vertical downward soil water potential gradient which led to the downward movement of soil salinity and resulting in the desalination occurring throughout the whole soil profile for each irrigation event 5 10 mm of water and the calculated fertilizer were applied which can realize salt leaching as well as water and fertilizer supply for plants at the same time however more water was applied for conventional drip irrigation for each irrigation event which was determined by lr or based on the experience of surface irrigation for example more than 1000 mm water was applied for the cotton using conventional drip irrigation wang et al 2011 which is much higher than the value of 600 mm in this study using the method of water salt regulation during the reclamation of the saline soils in karamay more water at each irrigation event can lead to more deep percolation then result in the rising of groundwater table and occurrence of secondary salinization which has been reported in xinjiang province in china wang et al 2011 moreover the unsaturated soil water flow is more effective in salt leaching compared with the saturated flow so the water amount applied for each irrigation event should not be too much overall the desalination caused by the method of water salt regulation using drip irrigation in this study is due to the control of smp and the irrigation was implemented with small water amount for each irrigation event and high frequency 5 3 land productivity the suitability of a soil for cropping depends greatly on the degree to which it conducts water nutrients air and heat and on physical properties that control friability of the seedbed higher na in saline soil can result in changes in exchangeable and soil solution ions and soil ph destabilization of soil structure deterioration of soil hydraulic properties increased susceptibility to crusting and imbalances in plant available nutrients akhter et al 2004 khoshgoftarmanesh et al 2003 prichard et al 1985 qadir and oster 2002 excess salt reduces soil permeability and thus total soil water potential which increases the energy that plants must expend to acquire water from soil and leads to difficulties in root water uptake with the decrease in water absorption nutrient uptake also decreases and because of imbalance of ion absorption due to excess salt an imbalanced or inadequate supply of plant nutrients occurs and thus plants are difficult to germinate or grow poorly plant response to salinity varies with many factors including climate soil conditions agronomic practices irrigation management crop variety stage of growth and salt composition wesley and tanji 2012 however for improving land productivity salt leaching is most important in the present study a low salt environment was quickly created under drip irrigation with the leaching of na the sar li et al 2015 and soil bulk density liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 decrease and soil field capacity liu et al 2012 sun et al 2012 infiltration rate sun et al 2012 soil microorganisms liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 soil enzyme activities and soil organic matter wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 increase which result in a suitable environment for plant growth the increase of drip irrigation with time results in an increasing yield and vigorous growth in field conditions in the present study soil alkalization occurred for saline soils which may affect acid loving plants and this may also be the reason for the low survival rate of some landscape plants in qingtongxia and dagang sites thus regulation of acidity and alkalinity by adding liquid acids to drip irrigation systems is proposed most plants are relatively salt tolerant during germination and are more sensitive during seedling emergence and early growth stages wesley and tanji 2012 and this is the reason that grasslands have degraded in da an on the songnen plain with the leaching of salt and improving of the soil environment the conditions required for seed germination and seedling growth of p tenuiflora were achieved using drip irrigation hence it is imperative to maintain low salinity in the seedbed after germination and create a suitable growth environment for salt sensitive or salt tolerant plants by filling planting holes with non saline soil to avoid high soil salinity during the early period of reclamation after 2 3 years of reclamation and utilization the yields of crops were close to levels of high yield using drip irrigation for local non saline farmland and good landscape vegetation ecosystems were created fig 6 in this study although the crop yield results were just analyzed for 5 kpa treatment yield close to or even higher than the levels in local non saline farmland using drip irrigation after 2 years was obtained for smp of 5 kpa treatments data not shown wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 this indicated that the method could provide suitable conditions for crops and achieve high yield in reclamation of saline sodic soil 5 4 some suggestions for the application of the water salt regulation method in the present study some suggestions were given for the application of the water salt regulation method based on the comprehensive analysis of field experiment results at five sites 1 it is effective for saline sodic restoration by controlling the smp at a depth of 0 2 m immediately under drip emitters and 5 kpa is suggested as the target smp value in early reclamation period and then the target smp value can be controlled lower with the decreasing soil salinity combined with a comprehensive consideration of water saving and high yield 5 10 mm of water can be applied for each irrigation event which can realize the salt leaching meet plant demand for water and save water resources due to less deep percolation rainwater can be utilized in regions with rich rainfall 2 ridge planting is suggested as one agronomic practice to lower groundwater table which is very important for regions with high groundwater table as well as for the perennial plant planted in arid and semi arid area ridge height and width can be determined by the groundwater table and plant crop type for arbor planting the ridge surface should be at least 1 3 1 5 m away from the groundwater table in addition mulching was suggested in crop planting in arid and semi arid area which can reduce the soil evaporation and inhibit salt accumulation in topsoil 6 conclusions drip irrigation was used in reclamation of saline soils differing in climates crop landscape plant species and planting pattern a low salinity environment was created in the whole soil profile especially in the root zone and the salt leaching process was divided into three stages rapid desalination slow desalination and salt stabilization the soil environment was improved with longer reclamation time and resulted in improved land productivity yields of crops that were close to the levels in local farmland after 2 3 years and good landscape vegetation ecosystems with establishment of artificial vegetation and natural germination of seeds in the soil seed bank soil alkalization should receive some attention during the salt leaching process as it may affect the growth of acid loving plants in addition the low survival rates for landscape plants that were salt sensitive non salt tolerant in the early reclamation period led to the proposal of creating a non saline soil environment by adding non saline soils into planting holes overall water salt regulation using scheduled drip irrigation to control the smp at a depth of 0 2 m immediately under drip emitters can be used for saline sodic restoration this can also effectively control rising groundwater levels and alleviate secondary salinization of irrigated farmland due to the characteristics of drip irrigation of high frequency and less water applied in each irrigation event

10709,wastewater reuse in agriculture can be a viable option to solve future freshwater shortages but may need an additional treatment process stage ii to become a safe option as wastewater reuse interacts with many facets of coupled human and water systems the introduction of stage ii treatment systems in wastewater reuse in agriculture must be understood in terms of socio hydrology this paper builds on a place based socio hydrological model of a wastewater reused watershed in south korea and uses it to 1 identify key parameters in human and water systems that have a significant impact on wastewater reuse in agriculture 2 explore the impacts of changing agricultural environments by altering the key parameters and 3 develop the possibility space of future changes from current decision making key parameters concern the characteristics of urbanization domestic water use and greenhouse cultivation urbanization can reduce the demand for stage ii irrigation within an urbanizing watershed by reducing irrigation areas and increasing water availability domestic water use has a large impact on the economics of indirect wastewater reuse greenhouse cultivation influences the demand for stage ii irrigation mainly by reducing water availability moreover it could further affect the demand if the communities evolved to have a greater concern for the use of groundwater resources the possibility space shows that wastewater reuse has a strong influence on groundwater and could relieve agricultural water deficits through the diversification of irrigation sources and could be a more economical irrigation practice than groundwater irrigation under changing agricultural environments keywords coupled human and water systems irrigation possibility space socio hydrology urbanization water reuse 1 introduction irrigation accounts for about 70 of global water withdrawals alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 predicted population growth climate change and resulting water scarcity pose a major threat to water for agricultural production de fraiture and wichelns 2010 and are forcing societies to look for alternative sources of irrigation water a growing number of studies suggest that wastewater is a viable alternative source of irrigation water in countries facing increased water shortages grant et al 2012 hanjra et al 2012 treated wastewater is being widely used as agricultural water around the world united nations world water assessment programme unwwap 2017 and previous studies estimate that more than 10 of the world s population consumes agricultural products cultivated with wastewater irrigation world health organization who 2006 many countries have started to develop guidelines and technologies to use treated wastewater as a safe irrigation source paranychianakis et al 2015 in particular the combined use of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and a reclamation system stage ii treatment after wwtp e g reverse osmosis ultraviolet disinfection produces quality irrigation water that helps achieve a safe agricultural environment contreras et al 2017 relying solely on a wwtp could lead to treated water that still contains high concentrations of salts heavy metals organic compounds emerging contaminants and nutrients chiou 2008 muñoz et al 2009 when this water is used over long periods of time these may accumulate in the soil and adversely affect crop growth mapanda et al 2005 tal 2016 therefore a stage ii treatment system is recommended to process the water further to make it safe for irrigation qadir et al 2015 past studies have monitored the impact of stage ii irrigation reclaimed wastewater irrigation following treatment with a stage ii system on crop growth health of the agricultural environment and sanitation and showed that the system can indeed lead to safe wastewater reuse practices and greater sustainability jang et al 2012 reznik et al 2017 despite these benefits determining whether a stage ii treatment system should be installed and how it should be operated is more than a technical decision problem because of the complexity of the interrelationships between stage ii irrigation and related human and water systems rendering the consequences of decisions highly uncertain wastewater reuse in agriculture is partly driven by environmental and social drivers and interacts with many facets of coupled human and water systems hanjra et al 2012 for example changes in population can directly affect effluent discharge from a wwtp while changes in climate and land use can affect agricultural water demand malik et al 2015 the reuse of treated wastewater can also produce major economic benefits since it can replace the development of new freshwater resources yang and abbaspour 2007 further hydrological conditions can alter the reuse ratio of indirect wastewater reuse otherwise known as the ratio of effluent discharge to total stream flow jeong et al 2016b thereby altering the actual reuse amount of treated wastewater resulting in changes to the economics of employing the stage ii treatment system in other words hydrological conditions can change the economic feasibility and demand for stage ii irrigation and may change the pattern of agricultural water use which can then influence the hydrological conditions themselves this suggests that decision making surrounding the installation and operation of stage ii treatment systems must consider the two way feedback of people and water in a socio hydrological context this paper therefore aims to examine the socio hydrological interrelationships involving stage ii irrigation to understand which factors in human and water systems have a significant impact on agricultural wastewater reuse and how their effects are propagated to the systems and to the stage ii irrigation practice in approaching this aim we use modeling to help elucidate the key drivers that account for these interrelationships and thus help guide the design of effective policies regarding agricultural wastewater reuse our modeling approach is motivated by socio hydrology the science of people and water humans and their actions are considered part of water cycle dynamics and the aim is to understand the dynamics of coupled human and water systems sivapalan et al 2012 the term stage ii treatment is used throughout this study to distinguish it from the regular wastewater treatment i e stage i treatment in this study employed by a wwtp a stage ii treatment system is synonymous with a reclamation system and is a decentralized on site wastewater treatment system for formal and indirect reuse i c case in fig 1 stage ii irrigation is often described as a direct and formal form of wastewater reuse wastewater reuse in agriculture is classified as direct or indirect on the basis of whether or not treated wastewater is diluted with freshwater rutkowski et al 2007 and as formal or informal on the basis of whether or not it is controlled by government agencies hanjra et al 2017 scott et al 2004 fig 1 most current wastewater reuse in agriculture is indirect and informal scott et al 2004 which can adversely affect crop growth and the aquatic environment in agricultural fields qadir et al 2015 this kind of reuse is expected to grow with urbanization i e as urbanization proceeds it is expected that more effluents will be discharged into streams and downstream water quality will be degraded hanjra et al 2017 sato et al 2013 stage ii treatment after a wwtp can help address these problems through the use of additional customized water treatment processes appropriate to a specific agricultural environment south korea provides an excellent testing ground to study wastewater reuse in agriculture and interrelationships involving stage ii irrigation because treated wastewater is already in use as an irrigation water source about 12 of wwtps with a treatment capacity of more than 500 m3 day 1 currently supply treated wastewater to agricultural lands in south korea mainly paddy fields ministry of environment me 2012 the government has also encouraged increased wastewater reuse to prepare for anticipated future freshwater shortages jang et al 2010 however it has been reported that effluent from wwtps can degrade downstream irrigation water quality in both urban and rural areas a recent investigation found that about 25 of the wwtps in operational use adversely impact irrigation water quality downstream through informal indirect reuse jeong et al 2016a farmers are also becoming increasingly concerned that the continued use of diluted treated wastewater as irrigation water produces negative impacts such as rice lodging i e flattening this may prompt farmers to increase the use of groundwater for irrigation which in turn can be a major concern for the government due to potential groundwater depletion ministry of land transport and maritime affairs mltm 2011 to deal with this potential problem there have been ongoing efforts by the government to move toward formal wastewater reuse and development of stage ii treatment systems for agricultural use jang et al 2010 kim et al 2014 co using a stage ii treatment system can result in a safe agricultural environment relieve farmers concerns about water quality as well as reduce groundwater pumping this co use however can significantly increase the cost of wastewater treatment and irrigation necessitating an economic assessment to support the upgrade hanjra et al 2015 there have been many important empirical studies that discuss different aspects of wastewater reuse in agriculture crop growth cirelli et al 2012 pedrero et al 2010 environmental impacts singh et al 2012 xu et al 2010 health risk fatta kassinos et al 2011 forslund et al 2010 economic evaluation drechsel et al 2015 hanjra et al 2015 yang and abbaspour 2007 and the perceptions of farmers and the general public rutkowski et al 2007 nevertheless these previous studies have mainly focused on broadening the understanding of wastewater reuse in agriculture regarding the aspects mentioned above they rarely assess how wastewater reuse in agriculture affects the human and water systems and how changing agricultural environments in turn affect wastewater reuse in agriculture in addition to these studies several modeling studies have been conducted to understand the effects of wastewater reuse in agriculture on hydrological systems jeong et al 2016b kim et al 2008 however these modeling studies ignored socio hydrological interactions they incorporate wastewater reuse in agriculture as a factor that affects surface hydrology and water quality but do not capture the ways in which these hydrological aspects can also affect wastewater reuse in agriculture on the other hand jeong and adamowski 2016 developed a place based socio hydrological model associated with wastewater reuse in agriculture and captured the detailed causal relationships between wastewater reuse induced hydrological processes groundwater and surface hydrology demand and supply for irrigation waters including stage ii irrigation water development of irrigation facilities the economics of irrigation sources and investment decisions although the study demonstrated the potential for application of the developed model there are knowledge gaps about which factors in human and water systems have a major impact on agricultural wastewater reuse systems how they change the system level behavior of wastewater reuse in agriculture and how such models can be used in providing practical insights for informed decision making the current study contributes to bridging these gaps by building on the place based socio hydrological model of jeong and adamowski 2016 which was validated for the study site we revise and analyze the model to identify the factors affecting a wastewater reuse scheme and to understand the possibility space of the wastewater reuse systems responses to changing agricultural environments the possibility space is defined as possible outcomes of alternative decisions also known as alternative futures that provide insights about the system dynamics though they are not necessarily the most likely futures sivapalan and blöschl 2015 in doing so we generate practical insights for wastewater reuse in agriculture that could help guide decision making despite uncertainty our model analysis proceeds as follows first using a sensitivity analysis we identify a set of key parameters in social and hydrological systems that have a strong influence on the future trajectory of wastewater reuse in agriculture second we explore the impacts of changing agricultural environments on wastewater reuse in agriculture by altering these key parameters third using monte carlo simulations we investigate how current decision making can shape the possibility space of system dynamics in the long run the possibility space can provide decision makers with practical insights that will enable them to derive strategies for introducing sustainable stage ii irrigation 2 case study the osan river watershed is located in a temperate monsoon climate it has an area of 98 3 k m 2 a main river length of 16 5 k m a drainage slope of 10 2 and a runoff to rainfall ratio of 0 54 the average annual precipitation is approximately 1 312 mm and the average annual temperature is approximately 12 c the watershed has experienced population growth and undergone rapid urbanization causing the osan wwtp to reach its current daily capacity of 140 000 m 3 fig 2 the population in the drainage area of the osan wwtp increased from 138 650 in 2005 to 297 560 in 2010 and as a result urban land increased 77 1463 ha whereas agricultural land decreased 36 1 252 ha increased population contributed to an increase in water availability through effluent discharge from the expanded wwtp since domestic water is supplied from outside the watershed the effluent from the osan wwtp accounts for about 30 of stream flow in the osan river during the irrigation period jeong et al 2016b which is the primary source of paddy irrigation from stream water agricultural pumping stations along the osan river irrigate treated wastewater diluted with stream water to the paddy fields downstream where reservoir irrigation water is not supplied this type of informal indirect wastewater reuse can cause adverse effects on the agricultural environment and farmers health in fact irrigation water used for paddy fields in this area did not meet water quality standards and had statistically higher salinity and nutrient concentrations compared to traditional irrigation water from an agricultural reservoir jeong et al 2016c farmers in this area have reported growth disorders such as rice lodging causing yield loss and occasionally complained of discomfort associated with odor from the diluted treated wastewater irrigation they began to worry that consumers would have a negative perception of their agricultural products not only paddy rice but all crops grown in the area and have increasingly asked for stage ii treatment systems to ensure quality irrigation water this demand will increase in the near future to meet their need for quality irrigation water for safe and high quality agricultural products however increasing reservoir irrigation which currently supplies about 68 of the agricultural water demand for paddy fields in the study area is impossible because of a consensus to stop further development of agricultural reservoirs due to environmental concerns and urbanization furthermore increasing greenhouse cultivation which irrigates with groundwater is causing a decline in the groundwater table in the watershed a growing concern of the government ministry of land transport and maritime affairs mltm 2011 to satisfy the increasing demand for quality irrigation water and the target irrigation rate of about 85 set by the korean government ministry of land transport and maritime affairs mltm 2011 the development of a safe irrigation source is essential formal indirect wastewater reuse may be the best option in this area to supply safe and quality irrigation water lessen farmers concerns and alleviate the problem of groundwater depletion therefore it is important to explore possible future trajectories of this watershed resulting from the evolving agricultural environment to ensure that investment decisions lead to a sustainable formal indirect wastewater reuse 3 materials and methods 3 1 model overview to gain practical insights for sustainable wastewater reuse we utilize a place based socio hydrological model representing the interactions between human and water systems of wastewater reuse in agriculture this model builds on a previous version by jeong and adamowski 2016 which was developed to study wastewater reuse in agriculture in the osan river watershed and which can be classified as a deterministic conceptual semi lumped hydrological model simulated at a monthly time scale the model reflects the change in land use by using the infiltration ratio for the given land use type while the watershed system is regarded as a single point in space without dimensions jeong and adamowski 2016 the current model differs from the previous version in two major ways the inclusion of a water availability function in the demand for stage ii irrigation and the effects of expanded greenhouses on wastewater reuse in agriculture a more detailed description of these additions is provided later in this section the model system is characterized by four main components hydrology irrigation demand and infrastructure three boundary conditions or external drivers climate population and land use and an investment dimension target irrigation rate and target stage ii irrigation rate fig 3 we have combined a scenario based approach and monte carlo simulations to test the model system behavior the four main components are interrelated as follows the hydrology component affects the reuse ratio and water availability the result of which alters the demand for stage ii irrigation in the demand component demands for two types of irrigation sources stage ii and groundwater in the demand component affect the infrastructure component by changing the need for facility development of stage ii irrigation and groundwater irrigation the demand and infrastructure components constrain the irrigation component governing the decisions on the irrigation amounts of stage ii irrigation and groundwater irrigation the irrigation component affects the hydrology component by consuming water through irrigation practices changing irrigation capacity in the irrigation component at the same time alters the required additional irrigation water which influences the demands for two types of irrigation sources in the demand component a wwtp in the infrastructure component creates effluent discharge which changes the stream water volume in the hydrology component the three external drivers shape changing boundary conditions the climate component plays a role as an input for the hydrology component and also affects the agricultural water demand in the demand component the population component changes the domestic water demand which creates the development demand for a wwtp in the infrastructure component the land use component affects the hydrology component by changing the infiltration rate and alters the agricultural water demand by changing the agricultural land area target irrigation rate and target stage ii irrigation rate in the investment dimension limit the agricultural water supply in the irrigation component and the demand for stage ii irrigation in the demand component respectively the major equations of the model are presented in table 1 further details on the model structure pertaining to all its equations are provided in the supplementary material in this socio hydrological modeling exercise we tried to balance tradeoffs between generality realism and precision as argued by troy et al 2015 and aimed at providing practical insights for informed decision making in the watershed we therefore included detailed modeling processes for the infrastructure and irrigation components which define the capacity of irrigation facility and irrigation amount respectively by doing this the model can provide more realistic estimates for the economic analysis of irrigation sources and changes in the hydrology component on the other hand this has allowed the model to have a more detailed and complex structure and use scientifically verified outcomes on wastewater reuse in agriculture for example only the economic benefits of wastewater reuse in agriculture found from previous studies were used to model the economic processes associated with stage ii irrigation these benefits include a reduction in fertilization jeong et al 2014 water quality improvement jang et al 2012 and water resource acquisition yang and abbaspour 2007 in addition the economics function includes community sensitivity to the economic viability in the demand for stage ii irrigation to reflect a community trying to consider benefits that are difficult to quantify drechsel et al 2015 also a scenario based approach was used for the investment dimension rather than modeling it to have a state variable with an accumulation process and a tipping point thus allowing for surprise and uncertainty in the systems by doing so we were able to generate practical insights to determine the appropriate level of formal wastewater reuse in the watershed table 1 includes the additional rationale and comments explaining how previous studies on wastewater reuse have contributed to this model in this new version of the place based socio hydrological model we have revised the demand for stage ii irrigation that couples hydrological and social systems underpinning wastewater reuse in agriculture we newly included a water availability function and a modified economic function in the demand as presented in table 1 equation 2c due to the importance of water availability in an irrigated watershed elshafei et al 2014 water availability in the watershed can affect the demand for stage ii irrigation from an increase in effluent discharge and extreme hydrological conditions e g drought in the long run the water availability function see equation 2e in table 1 consists of available water calculated as ten year moving averages of the sums of stream water volume and groundwater volume as well as community sensitivity to water availability γ w for the economic function the formulation was changed to include community sensitivity γ e to the economic viability of wastewater reuse in agriculture see equation 2f in table 1 with these changes more flexible economic gradients on wastewater reuse can be considered the new formulation also helps maintain stage ii irrigation for a certain period under other irrigation sources i e groundwater which can be more economical than stage ii treated water this is an important consideration because stage ii irrigation can be uneconomical compared to other irrigation practices over short periods but can become more economical in the long run we also included greenhouse cultivation in land use change as an emerging trend of agricultural practice in the study area see equation 6e in table 1 greenhouse cultivation competes for quality irrigation water and reduces paddy fields a prominent consumer of stage ii irrigation in addition greenhouse cultivation has expanded and evolved to consume more quality irrigation water in south korea to produce crops with a higher market price such as tomatoes and paprika south korea s land area for greenhouse cultivation doubled from 1990 44 613 ha to 2015 90 468 ha and the study area is one of the largest greenhouse cultivation complexes in south korea including the land use change due to greenhouse cultivation helps to develop an informed understanding from which an agricultural wastewater reuse scheme can be expanded to a larger scale e g regional and national the inclusion of greenhouse cultivation in the model meant that the agricultural water demand for greenhouse crops had to be factored see equation 2b in table 1 into the demand component and the greenhouse irrigation see equation 4e in table 1 into the irrigation component 3 2 sensitivity analysis a modified deterministic approach was used to examine system behavior sensitivity to each model parameter to determine the most influential factors in the design of an agricultural wastewater reuse scheme in the study area this approach included relative sensitivity s r a sensitivity index s i and a general sensitivity degree index s which considers nonlinear characteristics of system behavior and overall system performance for the entire simulation period cho and mostaghimi 2009 hamby 1994 wei et al 2012 table 2 shows detailed descriptions of the parameters evaluated as more than slightly sensitive to at least one system in the sensitivity analysis even though social and hydrological systems of wastewater reuse in agriculture are coupled in our study we separated them by borrowing from traditional concepts used in both domains the hydrological system represents the hydrology component and the social system represents the demand irrigation and infrastructure components as shown in fig 3 the uncertainty parameters of population growth rate δ and per capita domestic water use ζ were added to the model to more easily demonstrate their uncertainties changes in input parameters resulting in model output variation can be described by the relative sensitivity to take into account the nonlinear behavior of model input parameters relative sensitivity was calculated at six different levels 50 25 10 10 25 and 50 from these six relative sensitivities a sensitivity index was calculated to determine the overall relative sensitivity of the output variables furthermore the degree of sensitivity of an input parameter to the output variables known as the general sensitivity degree index was calculated to evaluate the impacts that specific parameters may have on the target system wei et al 2012 stream flow interflow and base flow for the hydrological system hydrology component equations 16 17 and 18 and demand for stage ii irrigation demand component equation 2c facility capacity of stage ii irrigation infrastructure component equation 3a and groundwater irrigation irrigation component equation 4d for the social system were selected as target variables to represent each component and system the relative sensitivity sensitivity index and general sensitivity degree index are expressed by 8 s r δ o o b δ p p b where s r is relative sensitivity δ o is change in the output o b is base output δ p is a change in the parameter value and p b is the base parameter value 9 s i 1 n i 1 n s r i where s i is the sensitivity index n is the number of levels of parameter changes for s r and s r i is the relative sensitivity of level i 10 s 1 n i 1 n s i i where s is the general sensitivity degree index n is the number of variables and s i i is the sensitivity index of variable i the sensitivity of the tested parameter is determined from the classifications for relative sensitivity used by storm et al 1988 jesiek and wolfe 2005 and song et al 2016 insensitive s 0 01 slightly sensitive 0 01 s 0 10 moderately sensitive 0 10 s 1 00 sensitive 1 00 s 2 00 and extremely sensitive s 2 00 3 3 simulation scenarios to understand the different consequences of the complex interactions of socio hydrological systems we use a scenario based approach for the investment dimension rather than modeling it as a delayed response to socio hydrological systems this approach was chosen not only because of the complexity of the policy dimension gober and wheater 2015 but also to provide practical insights to determine the appropriate level of wastewater reuse five simulation scenarios were designed to assess the impacts of urbanization domestic water use and greenhouse cultivation table 3 ten simulation scenarios were constructed to demonstrate the impacts of wastewater reuse in agriculture on social and hydrological systems using target irrigation rate t and target stage ii irrigation rate s which determines the target amount of stage ii irrigation table 3 the korean government aims to irrigate 84 3 of paddy fields through irrigation facilities by 2020 ministry of land transport and maritime affairs mltm 2011 therefore a target irrigation rate of 85 was used as a baseline scenario of agricultural water supply and a target irrigation rate of 90 was used for future long term water resources planning a target stage ii irrigation rate of 50 was used as a baseline scenario and a range of 0 100 was tested to find the appropriate rate of wastewater reuse the baseline scenario t85s50 for example indicates that decision makers aimed to supply 85 of the agricultural water demand for paddy fields and that 50 of the required additional irrigation water used to meet the target irrigation rate is sourced from stage ii irrigation following sivapalan and blöschl 2015 for the place based socio hydrological models to generate possible future and associated probabilities a monte carlo simulation was employed to simulate possibility spaces to see the impacts of wastewater reuse in agriculture considering the changing agricultural environments uncertainty of population growth rate δ uncertainty of per capita domestic water demand ζ urbanization factor of paddy field f u r b p conversion factor of paddy field to greenhouse f c o n and crop factor of greenhouse cultivation f c r o p were used to simulate the impacts of changing agricultural environments and to construct scenarios with the monte carlo simulation each parameter is assumed to have a uniform distribution a range of ζ 0 8 1 2 was determined based on statistics from nearby cities for per capita domestic water use ranging from 257 to 451 l person 1 day 1 ministry of environment me 2016 and the dewatering of economic growth rock 2000 the per capita domestic water use in the study watershed is 295 l person 1 day 1 the upper and lower bounds of the possible future per capita domestic water use were lower than for nearby cities at 236 and 354 l person 1 day 1 respectively a range of f c r o p 0 5 1 5 was determined from the agricultural water consumption of the popular greenhouse crops grown in the study area namely zucchini 0 5 tomato 1 0 and paprika 1 5 unit irrigation rate for zucchini tomato and paprika in this area is 810 1430 and 2 230 mm year 1 respectively a range of δ 1 0 2 0 was selected after studying the steeper increasing rate of population growth in the study area compared to the rate provided by statistics korea sk 2011 for the study area and surrounding cities ranges of f u r b p 0 003 0 009 and f c o n 0 0005 0 002 were determined by analyzing land use maps produced between 2007 and 2009 for f c o n the upper and lower bounds of the possible future conversion factor were heightened compared to the baseline rate 0 005 to reflect the current rapid expansion of greenhouse cultivation in the study area a total of 200 simulations were generated for each scenario projected for 50 years 2011 2060 to show possible trajectories future climate data of the representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp 8 5 scenario was acquired from the korean meteorological administration and bias corrected for the study area using the method of alcamo et al 1997 4 results in this section we first identify the key parameters that are important for developing an agricultural wastewater reuse scheme through sensitivity analysis fig 4 second we investigate the impacts of changing agricultural environments figs 5 7 which the key parameters bring about on socio hydrological systems of wastewater reuse in agriculture third we explore the possibility space figs 8 11 to provide decision makers with practical insights in designing sustainable wastewater reuse strategies given the changing agricultural environments using a monte carlo simulation 4 1 sensitivity analysis parameters evaluated as more than slightly sensitive to at least one system are presented in fig 4 soil characteristics s c f c parameters representing runoff processes c s t r e a m c i n t c p e r c g r e and land cover r i n f n r i n f u r were moderately sensitive and had a large impact on the hydrological system in addition to hydrological factors well known for their impacts on the hydrological response chen et al 2013 social factors related to the investment dimension domestic water use and a regional farming characteristic had a large impact on the hydrological system target irrigation rate t i per capita domestic water demand ζ and crop coefficient of greenhouse cultivation f c r o p were all rated as moderately sensitive fig 4a as expected human activities significantly impacted the social system the parameters related to the investment dimension target irrigation rate and target stage ii irrigation rate were the most sensitive in the system and were evaluated as extremely sensitive and moderately sensitive respectively fig 4b the economics of irrigation practices c s o uncertainties of domestic water use and population change ζ δ and land use change f u r b p were moderately sensitive and significantly impacted the social system the coefficient of stream flow c s t r e a m was evaluated as moderately sensitive on the social system fig 4b this is because stream flow in the watershed can significantly alter the demand and the economics of stage ii irrigation by directly affecting the stream water and groundwater volumes and reuse ratio the results from the sensitivity analysis presented the key parameters affecting the model and showed the importance of considering uncertainty arising from changing agricultural environments when designing an agricultural wastewater reuse scheme which was directly represented by the investment dimension t i t s in this study changes to the agricultural environment in the study watershed can be attributed to urbanization domestic water use and greenhouse cultivation as they can be represented by the key parameters δ and f u r b p ζ and δ and f c r o p and f c o n respectively they varied on a relatively short time scale and had large uncertainties the impacts of changing agricultural environments are explored in the following section and parameter uncertainty is employed to construct the monte carlo simulations to see the possibility space of changes in the socio hydrological systems that investment decisions could cause although hydrological characteristics can have a large influence on socio hydrological systems in this watershed they are topographic parameters that vary over a very long time scale and were calibrated to properly reproduce the hydrological processes in the watershed parameters related to the economics of stage ii irrigation are left as initial values in the following sections since they reflect the current level of technology 4 2 the impacts of changing agricultural environments 4 2 1 urbanization the study watershed has undergone significant urbanization involving population growth and land use change generally this has led to greater demand for food and consequently agricultural water which may potentially raise the demand for agricultural wastewater reuse in the investment dimension therefore demand for agricultural wastewater reuse would increase as the population increases however at the urban watershed scale urbanization may reduce the demand for stage ii irrigation as it accompanies a decrease in agricultural land reducing agricultural water demand fig 5 nevertheless it requires a stage ii treatment system for a safe agricultural environment in the three urbanization scenarios p1 5u1 5 p1 5u1 0 baseline p1 5u0 5 paddy field area decreased to about 1 080 1 310 and 1 530 ha respectively to satisfy the target irrigation and stage ii irrigation rates the simulated average annual agricultural water demand for the three scenarios ranged from 15 83 to 20 98 million m 3 a difference that contributes to 27 9 of the baseline agricultural water demand 18 41 million m 3 while the simulated average annual demand for stage ii irrigation ranged from 1 25 to 1 65 million m 3 a difference that contributes to 27 5 of the baseline agricultural water demand 1 45 million m 3 increased domestic water use from urbanization could also partially contribute to reduced demand for stage ii irrigation by increasing water availability in the watershed fig 5c the demand for stage ii irrigation in the p2 0u1 0 scenario was similar to that of p1 5u1 5 while the agricultural water demand in the p2 0u1 0 scenario was larger than that of p1 5u1 5 simulation results showed that reducing agricultural land had a much larger and substantial impact on wastewater reuse in agriculture than urban population growth it is important to note that this is a result of a case study where the domestic water is supplied from outside the watershed the increased population from urbanization does not consume water from the watershed but only produces more effluent to the watershed which increases the water availability therefore the relationship between urbanization and the demand for stage ii irrigation at the watershed scale may be different from other regions furthermore the demand for stage ii irrigation will increase nationwide since population growth and economic development which increase quality water use vörösmarty et al 2000 are expected in south korea the increased demand for quality water necessitates securing alternative water sources like treated wastewater which plays a role as an exogenous factor to the watershed that raises the demand 4 2 2 domestic water use as the urban population consumes more domestic water stream flow in the urbanized watershed will increase fig 6a the simulated monthly average stream flow for the three per capita domestic water use scenarios p1 5w0 8 p1 5w1 0 baseline p1 5w1 2 ranged from 9 04 to 10 55 million m 3 a difference that constitutes about 15 4 of the baseline stream flow 9 81 million m 3 while that for the three population growth scenarios p1 0w1 0 p1 5w1 0 p2 0w1 0 ranged from 9 59 to 10 04 million m 3 a difference that constitutes about 4 5 of the baseline stream flow although increased stream flow might reduce stage ii irrigation due to a decrease in demand for stage ii irrigation from greater water availability the actual reuse amount of treated wastewater increased as per capita domestic water use increased fig 6 for example the simulated monthly average reuse amount of treated wastewater increased from 0 49 to 0 54 million m 3 as per capita domestic water use increased from 236 p1 5w0 8 to 354 l person 1 day 1 p1 5w1 2 meanwhile simulated monthly average stage ii irrigation decreased from 1 39 to 1 23 million m 3 fig 6d shows the importance of per capita domestic water use to determine the reuse ratio and the economics of stage ii irrigation a high reuse ratio can contribute to economically viable stage ii irrigation the monthly average cost of stage ii irrigation for p1 5w1 0 baseline p1 5w0 8 p1 5w1 2 p1 0w1 0 and p2 0w1 0 scenarios were 121 139 105 127 and 115 us dollars per thousand m 3 respectively for the simulation period all scenarios showed lower irrigation cost for stage ii irrigation than for groundwater irrigation cost as the monthly average cost of groundwater irrigation for baseline p1 5w0 8 p1 5w1 2 p1 0w1 0 and p2 0w1 0 scenarios were 207 207 208 208 and 206 us dollars per thousand m 3 respectively a difference in the monthly average cost of stage ii irrigation in the three per capita domestic water use scenarios was bigger than that in the three population growth scenarios as they ranged 12 9 15 5 and 5 0 5 1 from the baseline scenario respectively 4 2 3 greenhouse cultivation greenhouse cultivation which is an emerging agricultural opportunity due to its high profitability is one of the largest consumers of groundwater in south korea and is rapidly expanding in the study watershed simulation results from greenhouse cultivation scenarios showed that changes in crop type and rapid expansion of greenhouse cultivation could have a substantial impact on the hydrological system fig 7 the simulated monthly average groundwater volumes according to greenhouse cultivation scenarios c1 0g0 5 c1 0g1 0 c1 0g2 0 ranged from 1 18 to 1 63 million m 3 a difference that constitutes about 31 of the baseline c1 0g0 5 groundwater volume 1 40 million m 3 planting a more water consuming crop in the greenhouse had a large impact on the groundwater volume as shown by c1 5g0 5 paprika which had the same estimation of future greenhouse area as the baseline c1 0g0 5 tomato which was estimated at 1 18 million m 3 similar to that of c1 0g2 0 tomato on the other hand greenhouse cultivation had a relatively small impact on wastewater reuse in agriculture even if it could significantly change groundwater volume affecting the demand for stage ii irrigation and reduce the paddy field area fig 7 this is because the groundwater volume in the study area represents only 12 of the total available water volume i e sum of stream water and groundwater volume that the watershed can produce the estimated average annual demands for stage ii irrigation ranged from 1 38 to 1 48 million m 3 a difference that constitutes about 7 of the baseline demand 1 45 million m 3 the decrease in the paddy field area due to greenhouse expansion had a larger impact than groundwater consumption by greenhouse cultivation on wastewater reuse in agriculture if the community in the watershed evolves towards a society sensitive to water availability particularly groundwater availability then the impacts of greenhouse cultivation would rise 4 3 the possibility space 4 3 1 hydrology indirect wastewater reuse directly affected stream flow by consuming irrigation water from the stream that received the treated effluent monthly mean stream flow for t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 baseline t85s75 and t85s100 scenarios for the simulation period were estimated to range from 9 73 to 9 79 million m 3 fig 8 a difference that constitutes about 0 6 of the baseline stream flow 9 76 million m 3 and indicates that indirect wastewater reuse had little influence on stream flow this is due to the seasonality of stream flow in the watershed in which stream flow is several times higher during the irrigation period than the normal flow jeong et al 2016b this mitigates the impact of stage ii irrigation on the stream water and causes the volume of stream flow to be significantly larger than that of intake volume simulation results showed that irrigating predominantly with groundwater led to locally unsustainable use of groundwater while stage ii irrigation could contribute to sustainable groundwater use fig 8 simulated monthly mean groundwater volumes of t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 baseline t85s75 and t85s100 ranged from 1 20 to 1 43 million m 3 a difference that constitutes about 18 of the baseline groundwater volume 1 31 million m 3 for the simulation period the results of these scenarios showed that an additional source of irrigation water should be made available to prevent groundwater exploitation if the government wants to meet its target irrigation rate of about 85 for scenarios with lower target stage ii irrigation rates t85s00 t85s25 t90s00 and t90s25 the groundwater volume dropped continuously and in some cases showed a negative value indicating that groundwater usage surpassed capacity in the study watershed therefore for the government target irrigation rate to be reached developing a stage ii irrigation facility to supply more than 50 of the required additional irrigation water is recommended to maintain a sustainable groundwater volume and ensure quality irrigation water in the future 4 3 2 demand for wastewater reuse the demand for stage ii irrigation reflected the target irrigation rate and target stage ii irrigation rate fig 9 estimates for the average annual demands of t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 baseline t85s75 and t85s100 scenarios were 0 00 0 73 1 44 2 15 and 2 85 million m 3 respectively for the simulation period the uncertainties implicit in coupled human and water systems had a large impact on the demand as the target stage ii irrigation rate increased fig 9 a large uncertainty in the demand occurred when the annual demand exceeded that of the baseline scenario this was mainly caused by uncertainty in agricultural water demand depending on land use change and partially caused by water availability related to domestic water use the demands tended to decrease until the 2020s when agricultural land continually declined due to urban expansion and the decline increased as the target stage ii irrigation rate rose a conservative approach for the design of a stage ii irrigation facility is needed to avoid excessive development especially for scenarios t85s75 t85s100 t90s75 and t90s100 4 3 3 irrigation facility facilities capable of irrigating with groundwater and stage ii water were needed to meet the required agricultural water supply the two irrigation capacities had a complementary relationship that ensured an adequate supply of the required additional irrigation water estimated required monthly facility capacities for groundwater irrigation were 0 55 0 42 0 29 0 16 and 0 11 million m 3 for t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 baseline t85s75 and t85s100 respectively fig 10 for stage ii irrigation the estimated required monthly facility capacities were 0 00 0 20 0 39 0 59 and 0 78 million m 3 for the same scenarios respectively fig 10 considering the simulation results for groundwater volume the facility capacities of t85s50 t85s75 and t85s100 for stage ii irrigation indicated an appropriate development capacity for the wastewater reuse scheme in this watershed to sustain and increase groundwater volume and enable downstream groundwater irrigation of greenhouse cultivation furthermore in the long run simulation results of total net present irrigation cost showed that increasing the stage ii irrigation facility capacity would not always result in an increase in irrigation costs even though it could increase the uncertainty in the economics of stage ii irrigation fig 10 the estimated net present irrigation costs to supply the target irrigation rate of t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 t85s75 and t85s100 scenarios were 5 79 5 87 5 94 5 99 and 5 69 million us dollars in 2060 respectively even for scenarios targeting 100 of stage ii irrigation water for the required additional irrigation water t85s100 t90s100 the estimated net present irrigation costs were found to be less expensive than not implementing an agricultural wastewater reuse practice i e t85s00 and t90s00 in the watershed therefore implementing 100 of stage ii irrigation for the additional irrigation would be the most economically favorable option for this watershed 4 3 4 irrigation amount estimates for the annual average amount of groundwater irrigation for the simulation period were 1 80 1 42 1 03 0 64 and 0 20 million m 3 for the t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 baseline t85s75 and t85s100 scenarios respectively fig 11 the amounts drastically decreased as stage ii irrigation increased and for the t85s100 scenario existing groundwater irrigation facilities in the watershed were sufficient estimated average annual amounts of stage ii irrigation were 0 00 0 65 1 29 1 92 and 2 55 million m 3 for t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 t85s75 and t85s100 respectively fig 11 as stage ii irrigation increased the agricultural water deficit which refers to the shortage of agricultural water compared to the target irrigation rate was reduced the estimated average annual agricultural water deficits of the t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 t85s75 and t85s100 scenarios were 1 22 0 95 0 68 0 43 and 0 25 million m 3 respectively for the simulation period in the t85s00 scenario the estimated deficit was about five times larger than the deficit of the t85s100 scenario for scenarios targeting 100 of stage ii irrigation water for the required additional irrigation water t85s100 t90s100 the deficit lasted only until the 2010s and occurred only under severe drought conditions after that fig 11 this indicated that the target irrigation rate could be achieved faster and be more stable by increasing the amount of stage ii irrigation the results also show that a stable supply of agricultural water could be achieved through the diversification of irrigation water sources 5 discussion and conclusions wastewater reuse in agriculture is becoming inevitable worldwide due to increasing levels of urbanization on the supply or opportunity side and the worsening of freshwater shortages facing these challenges south korea and its government have adopted the policy of encouraging the use of advanced stage ii water treatment systems for safe wastewater reuse in agriculture this initiative is driven by coupled human and water systems dynamics dynamic elements of the systems such as demand for irrigation water agricultural practices and surface and groundwater hydrology are complex and their coupling makes decision making difficult our study is based on an extension of the place based socio hydrological model of jeong and adamowski 2016 to investigate the possibility space for future trajectories of system dynamics we use the model to develop knowledge that can help decision makers to make informed choices on the design of sustainable wastewater reuse strategies in south korea and beyond based on our model analysis we identified a set of key parameters that cause significant uncertainties in the model system dynamics we explored the influences of these key parameters on the agricultural wastewater reuse system the identified key parameters concern the characteristics of urbanization domestic water use and changes in agricultural practices the model simulation provided key insights first our results show that urbanization can reduce the demand for stage ii irrigation within an urbanizing watershed accelerated urbanization has been known to increase informal indirect reuse trinh et al 2013 and wastewater reuse due to intensified water competition united nations world water assessment programme unwwap 2017 our results however show that urbanization with land use change and population growth can reduce the area under agricultural cultivation as well as increase water availability from increased effluent discharge within an urbanizing watershed thus these two factors may contribute to an overall decrease in the demand for stage ii irrigation this result suggests that careful consideration of future land use changes is required when considering the development of stage ii irrigation facilities within an urbanized area second our model results show that domestic water use in urban areas can have a significant effect on the economics of wastewater reuse in agriculture an increase in domestic water use led to an increase in the actual reuse amount of wastewater through indirect reuse by increasing the proportion of treated wastewater in irrigation water this enhanced the economics of stage ii irrigation compared with urbanization and associated population growth changes in the pattern of domestic water use i e per capita domestic water use may have a greater effect on the economics of stage ii irrigation this is because the amount of treated wastewater consumed by stage ii irrigation can decrease if the per capita domestic water use decreases even though the population is increasing this result suggests that stage ii irrigation in countries or regions with higher domestic water consumption per capita can be more economically viable for indirect wastewater reuse it also indicates that changes in per capita domestic water use may be more important in planning stage ii irrigation than the increase or decrease in population third the influences of changes in agricultural practices on wastewater reuse can vary depending on the sensitivity of the community to water availability and the regional hydrological conditions greenhouse cultivation an emerging agricultural practice in the study area and which mostly consumes groundwater influenced the demand for stage ii irrigation mainly by reducing water availability from streams and groundwater the expansion of the greenhouse area and the choice of cultivated crops could pose a major threat to the groundwater resources of the watershed since groundwater volume is much smaller than stream water volume in this case the impact of greenhouse cultivation on overall water availability was small and consequently had little effect on wastewater reuse in agriculture however the influence of greenhouse cultivation on wastewater reuse in agriculture could be greater if the community in the watershed evolves to have a greater concern for water availability this result suggests that in areas where there is a lack of water or a high level of awareness of water availability changes in agricultural practices that consume a lot of water could be an important factor in wastewater reuse we also explored the possibility space of future trajectories of system dynamics that result from different investment choices the scenario where 100 of the required additional irrigation water was supplied through stage ii irrigation t85s100 appeared to be the best option to meet the target irrigation rate set by the government for this particular watershed the t85s100 scenario preserved 270 000 m 3 more groundwater per month on average which is about 20 of the monthly average groundwater volume that the study watershed can produce than the scenario not using stage ii irrigation t85s00 moreover the t85s100 scenario achieved the target irrigation rate in a shorter period of time and was more stable than other scenarios because it was consistently able to meet the target irrigation rate except during severe drought conditions ultimately the estimated facility capacity of stage ii irrigation for scenario t85s100 was about 780 000 m 3 per month about 29 of the annual average demand for stage ii irrigation in this scenario it may not be economical however to develop stage ii irrigation facilities to the full estimated capacity in the scenarios due to implicit uncertainties involved in urbanization the estimated net present irrigation cost for the t85s100 scenario was also found to be less expensive than that of t85s00 the findings regarding the possibility spaces have a few implications for wastewater reuse in agriculture first stage ii irrigation can diversify irrigation water sources and relieve agricultural water deficits this reduces the chance of depleting water resources projected possibility spaces show that stage ii irrigation can preserve groundwater volume in the study watershed this result is in line with the study conducted by murray and ray 2010 which showed that wastewater reuse could conserve millions of tons of water in local rivers each year the diversification of irrigation water sources can also enhance the resilience of agricultural systems to reliably produce agricultural products under global change despite the large inter annual variations in the possibility space of hydrology demand and irrigation components mostly due to future climate change agricultural water deficit occurs very rarely when sufficient stage ii irrigation is available second stage ii irrigation could be an economically viable option for indirect wastewater reuse when targeting paddy rice cultivation the possibility spaces show that stage ii irrigation that uses a decentralized advanced treatment system can guide informal indirect reuse as an economically sound agricultural practice this suggests that there is room for improvement in wastewater reuse in agriculture even in countries with well maintained wastewater treatment facilities and relatively rich surface water resources overall our observations show that stage ii irrigation may help achieve the sustainable development goal of better managing water to sustain people and the environment through improvements in the sustainable use and development of water resources and wastewater management malik et al 2015 under changing agricultural environments related to urbanization and climate variability few socio hydrological models have been used to design an actual water policy rather the models have so far mainly focused on the understanding of human behaviors to flood dynamics and tradeoffs in water use chen et al 2016 di baldassarre et al 2013 kandasamy et al 2014 liu et al 2015 yu et al 2017 on the other hand this study demonstrates how socio hydrological models can be useful in designing a wastewater reuse scheme an important component in water cycle dynamics that can significantly alter the hydrological regime srinivasan et al 2017 jeong et al 2016b nevertheless models are opinions embedded in mathematics o neil 2016 and our model is based on experiences with our study site in south korea for these reasons this study has several limitations for example the representation of the investment dimension was simplified and as a result a scenario based approach was needed to explore the possible effects of different investment decisions as such we could not explore the dynamics of social awareness and acceptance of wastewater reuse our model also relies on overly detailed relationships between human and water systems with respect to wastewater reuse this resulted in relatively restricted dynamics in the interactions between system components in a future study a more stylized model building on our work could be developed to gain more general insights regarding social response to changing agricultural environments this additional step would build off the understanding of wastewater reuse issues presented in this study and would also prove worthwhile for guiding future water reuse

10709,wastewater reuse in agriculture can be a viable option to solve future freshwater shortages but may need an additional treatment process stage ii to become a safe option as wastewater reuse interacts with many facets of coupled human and water systems the introduction of stage ii treatment systems in wastewater reuse in agriculture must be understood in terms of socio hydrology this paper builds on a place based socio hydrological model of a wastewater reused watershed in south korea and uses it to 1 identify key parameters in human and water systems that have a significant impact on wastewater reuse in agriculture 2 explore the impacts of changing agricultural environments by altering the key parameters and 3 develop the possibility space of future changes from current decision making key parameters concern the characteristics of urbanization domestic water use and greenhouse cultivation urbanization can reduce the demand for stage ii irrigation within an urbanizing watershed by reducing irrigation areas and increasing water availability domestic water use has a large impact on the economics of indirect wastewater reuse greenhouse cultivation influences the demand for stage ii irrigation mainly by reducing water availability moreover it could further affect the demand if the communities evolved to have a greater concern for the use of groundwater resources the possibility space shows that wastewater reuse has a strong influence on groundwater and could relieve agricultural water deficits through the diversification of irrigation sources and could be a more economical irrigation practice than groundwater irrigation under changing agricultural environments keywords coupled human and water systems irrigation possibility space socio hydrology urbanization water reuse 1 introduction irrigation accounts for about 70 of global water withdrawals alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 predicted population growth climate change and resulting water scarcity pose a major threat to water for agricultural production de fraiture and wichelns 2010 and are forcing societies to look for alternative sources of irrigation water a growing number of studies suggest that wastewater is a viable alternative source of irrigation water in countries facing increased water shortages grant et al 2012 hanjra et al 2012 treated wastewater is being widely used as agricultural water around the world united nations world water assessment programme unwwap 2017 and previous studies estimate that more than 10 of the world s population consumes agricultural products cultivated with wastewater irrigation world health organization who 2006 many countries have started to develop guidelines and technologies to use treated wastewater as a safe irrigation source paranychianakis et al 2015 in particular the combined use of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and a reclamation system stage ii treatment after wwtp e g reverse osmosis ultraviolet disinfection produces quality irrigation water that helps achieve a safe agricultural environment contreras et al 2017 relying solely on a wwtp could lead to treated water that still contains high concentrations of salts heavy metals organic compounds emerging contaminants and nutrients chiou 2008 muñoz et al 2009 when this water is used over long periods of time these may accumulate in the soil and adversely affect crop growth mapanda et al 2005 tal 2016 therefore a stage ii treatment system is recommended to process the water further to make it safe for irrigation qadir et al 2015 past studies have monitored the impact of stage ii irrigation reclaimed wastewater irrigation following treatment with a stage ii system on crop growth health of the agricultural environment and sanitation and showed that the system can indeed lead to safe wastewater reuse practices and greater sustainability jang et al 2012 reznik et al 2017 despite these benefits determining whether a stage ii treatment system should be installed and how it should be operated is more than a technical decision problem because of the complexity of the interrelationships between stage ii irrigation and related human and water systems rendering the consequences of decisions highly uncertain wastewater reuse in agriculture is partly driven by environmental and social drivers and interacts with many facets of coupled human and water systems hanjra et al 2012 for example changes in population can directly affect effluent discharge from a wwtp while changes in climate and land use can affect agricultural water demand malik et al 2015 the reuse of treated wastewater can also produce major economic benefits since it can replace the development of new freshwater resources yang and abbaspour 2007 further hydrological conditions can alter the reuse ratio of indirect wastewater reuse otherwise known as the ratio of effluent discharge to total stream flow jeong et al 2016b thereby altering the actual reuse amount of treated wastewater resulting in changes to the economics of employing the stage ii treatment system in other words hydrological conditions can change the economic feasibility and demand for stage ii irrigation and may change the pattern of agricultural water use which can then influence the hydrological conditions themselves this suggests that decision making surrounding the installation and operation of stage ii treatment systems must consider the two way feedback of people and water in a socio hydrological context this paper therefore aims to examine the socio hydrological interrelationships involving stage ii irrigation to understand which factors in human and water systems have a significant impact on agricultural wastewater reuse and how their effects are propagated to the systems and to the stage ii irrigation practice in approaching this aim we use modeling to help elucidate the key drivers that account for these interrelationships and thus help guide the design of effective policies regarding agricultural wastewater reuse our modeling approach is motivated by socio hydrology the science of people and water humans and their actions are considered part of water cycle dynamics and the aim is to understand the dynamics of coupled human and water systems sivapalan et al 2012 the term stage ii treatment is used throughout this study to distinguish it from the regular wastewater treatment i e stage i treatment in this study employed by a wwtp a stage ii treatment system is synonymous with a reclamation system and is a decentralized on site wastewater treatment system for formal and indirect reuse i c case in fig 1 stage ii irrigation is often described as a direct and formal form of wastewater reuse wastewater reuse in agriculture is classified as direct or indirect on the basis of whether or not treated wastewater is diluted with freshwater rutkowski et al 2007 and as formal or informal on the basis of whether or not it is controlled by government agencies hanjra et al 2017 scott et al 2004 fig 1 most current wastewater reuse in agriculture is indirect and informal scott et al 2004 which can adversely affect crop growth and the aquatic environment in agricultural fields qadir et al 2015 this kind of reuse is expected to grow with urbanization i e as urbanization proceeds it is expected that more effluents will be discharged into streams and downstream water quality will be degraded hanjra et al 2017 sato et al 2013 stage ii treatment after a wwtp can help address these problems through the use of additional customized water treatment processes appropriate to a specific agricultural environment south korea provides an excellent testing ground to study wastewater reuse in agriculture and interrelationships involving stage ii irrigation because treated wastewater is already in use as an irrigation water source about 12 of wwtps with a treatment capacity of more than 500 m3 day 1 currently supply treated wastewater to agricultural lands in south korea mainly paddy fields ministry of environment me 2012 the government has also encouraged increased wastewater reuse to prepare for anticipated future freshwater shortages jang et al 2010 however it has been reported that effluent from wwtps can degrade downstream irrigation water quality in both urban and rural areas a recent investigation found that about 25 of the wwtps in operational use adversely impact irrigation water quality downstream through informal indirect reuse jeong et al 2016a farmers are also becoming increasingly concerned that the continued use of diluted treated wastewater as irrigation water produces negative impacts such as rice lodging i e flattening this may prompt farmers to increase the use of groundwater for irrigation which in turn can be a major concern for the government due to potential groundwater depletion ministry of land transport and maritime affairs mltm 2011 to deal with this potential problem there have been ongoing efforts by the government to move toward formal wastewater reuse and development of stage ii treatment systems for agricultural use jang et al 2010 kim et al 2014 co using a stage ii treatment system can result in a safe agricultural environment relieve farmers concerns about water quality as well as reduce groundwater pumping this co use however can significantly increase the cost of wastewater treatment and irrigation necessitating an economic assessment to support the upgrade hanjra et al 2015 there have been many important empirical studies that discuss different aspects of wastewater reuse in agriculture crop growth cirelli et al 2012 pedrero et al 2010 environmental impacts singh et al 2012 xu et al 2010 health risk fatta kassinos et al 2011 forslund et al 2010 economic evaluation drechsel et al 2015 hanjra et al 2015 yang and abbaspour 2007 and the perceptions of farmers and the general public rutkowski et al 2007 nevertheless these previous studies have mainly focused on broadening the understanding of wastewater reuse in agriculture regarding the aspects mentioned above they rarely assess how wastewater reuse in agriculture affects the human and water systems and how changing agricultural environments in turn affect wastewater reuse in agriculture in addition to these studies several modeling studies have been conducted to understand the effects of wastewater reuse in agriculture on hydrological systems jeong et al 2016b kim et al 2008 however these modeling studies ignored socio hydrological interactions they incorporate wastewater reuse in agriculture as a factor that affects surface hydrology and water quality but do not capture the ways in which these hydrological aspects can also affect wastewater reuse in agriculture on the other hand jeong and adamowski 2016 developed a place based socio hydrological model associated with wastewater reuse in agriculture and captured the detailed causal relationships between wastewater reuse induced hydrological processes groundwater and surface hydrology demand and supply for irrigation waters including stage ii irrigation water development of irrigation facilities the economics of irrigation sources and investment decisions although the study demonstrated the potential for application of the developed model there are knowledge gaps about which factors in human and water systems have a major impact on agricultural wastewater reuse systems how they change the system level behavior of wastewater reuse in agriculture and how such models can be used in providing practical insights for informed decision making the current study contributes to bridging these gaps by building on the place based socio hydrological model of jeong and adamowski 2016 which was validated for the study site we revise and analyze the model to identify the factors affecting a wastewater reuse scheme and to understand the possibility space of the wastewater reuse systems responses to changing agricultural environments the possibility space is defined as possible outcomes of alternative decisions also known as alternative futures that provide insights about the system dynamics though they are not necessarily the most likely futures sivapalan and blöschl 2015 in doing so we generate practical insights for wastewater reuse in agriculture that could help guide decision making despite uncertainty our model analysis proceeds as follows first using a sensitivity analysis we identify a set of key parameters in social and hydrological systems that have a strong influence on the future trajectory of wastewater reuse in agriculture second we explore the impacts of changing agricultural environments on wastewater reuse in agriculture by altering these key parameters third using monte carlo simulations we investigate how current decision making can shape the possibility space of system dynamics in the long run the possibility space can provide decision makers with practical insights that will enable them to derive strategies for introducing sustainable stage ii irrigation 2 case study the osan river watershed is located in a temperate monsoon climate it has an area of 98 3 k m 2 a main river length of 16 5 k m a drainage slope of 10 2 and a runoff to rainfall ratio of 0 54 the average annual precipitation is approximately 1 312 mm and the average annual temperature is approximately 12 c the watershed has experienced population growth and undergone rapid urbanization causing the osan wwtp to reach its current daily capacity of 140 000 m 3 fig 2 the population in the drainage area of the osan wwtp increased from 138 650 in 2005 to 297 560 in 2010 and as a result urban land increased 77 1463 ha whereas agricultural land decreased 36 1 252 ha increased population contributed to an increase in water availability through effluent discharge from the expanded wwtp since domestic water is supplied from outside the watershed the effluent from the osan wwtp accounts for about 30 of stream flow in the osan river during the irrigation period jeong et al 2016b which is the primary source of paddy irrigation from stream water agricultural pumping stations along the osan river irrigate treated wastewater diluted with stream water to the paddy fields downstream where reservoir irrigation water is not supplied this type of informal indirect wastewater reuse can cause adverse effects on the agricultural environment and farmers health in fact irrigation water used for paddy fields in this area did not meet water quality standards and had statistically higher salinity and nutrient concentrations compared to traditional irrigation water from an agricultural reservoir jeong et al 2016c farmers in this area have reported growth disorders such as rice lodging causing yield loss and occasionally complained of discomfort associated with odor from the diluted treated wastewater irrigation they began to worry that consumers would have a negative perception of their agricultural products not only paddy rice but all crops grown in the area and have increasingly asked for stage ii treatment systems to ensure quality irrigation water this demand will increase in the near future to meet their need for quality irrigation water for safe and high quality agricultural products however increasing reservoir irrigation which currently supplies about 68 of the agricultural water demand for paddy fields in the study area is impossible because of a consensus to stop further development of agricultural reservoirs due to environmental concerns and urbanization furthermore increasing greenhouse cultivation which irrigates with groundwater is causing a decline in the groundwater table in the watershed a growing concern of the government ministry of land transport and maritime affairs mltm 2011 to satisfy the increasing demand for quality irrigation water and the target irrigation rate of about 85 set by the korean government ministry of land transport and maritime affairs mltm 2011 the development of a safe irrigation source is essential formal indirect wastewater reuse may be the best option in this area to supply safe and quality irrigation water lessen farmers concerns and alleviate the problem of groundwater depletion therefore it is important to explore possible future trajectories of this watershed resulting from the evolving agricultural environment to ensure that investment decisions lead to a sustainable formal indirect wastewater reuse 3 materials and methods 3 1 model overview to gain practical insights for sustainable wastewater reuse we utilize a place based socio hydrological model representing the interactions between human and water systems of wastewater reuse in agriculture this model builds on a previous version by jeong and adamowski 2016 which was developed to study wastewater reuse in agriculture in the osan river watershed and which can be classified as a deterministic conceptual semi lumped hydrological model simulated at a monthly time scale the model reflects the change in land use by using the infiltration ratio for the given land use type while the watershed system is regarded as a single point in space without dimensions jeong and adamowski 2016 the current model differs from the previous version in two major ways the inclusion of a water availability function in the demand for stage ii irrigation and the effects of expanded greenhouses on wastewater reuse in agriculture a more detailed description of these additions is provided later in this section the model system is characterized by four main components hydrology irrigation demand and infrastructure three boundary conditions or external drivers climate population and land use and an investment dimension target irrigation rate and target stage ii irrigation rate fig 3 we have combined a scenario based approach and monte carlo simulations to test the model system behavior the four main components are interrelated as follows the hydrology component affects the reuse ratio and water availability the result of which alters the demand for stage ii irrigation in the demand component demands for two types of irrigation sources stage ii and groundwater in the demand component affect the infrastructure component by changing the need for facility development of stage ii irrigation and groundwater irrigation the demand and infrastructure components constrain the irrigation component governing the decisions on the irrigation amounts of stage ii irrigation and groundwater irrigation the irrigation component affects the hydrology component by consuming water through irrigation practices changing irrigation capacity in the irrigation component at the same time alters the required additional irrigation water which influences the demands for two types of irrigation sources in the demand component a wwtp in the infrastructure component creates effluent discharge which changes the stream water volume in the hydrology component the three external drivers shape changing boundary conditions the climate component plays a role as an input for the hydrology component and also affects the agricultural water demand in the demand component the population component changes the domestic water demand which creates the development demand for a wwtp in the infrastructure component the land use component affects the hydrology component by changing the infiltration rate and alters the agricultural water demand by changing the agricultural land area target irrigation rate and target stage ii irrigation rate in the investment dimension limit the agricultural water supply in the irrigation component and the demand for stage ii irrigation in the demand component respectively the major equations of the model are presented in table 1 further details on the model structure pertaining to all its equations are provided in the supplementary material in this socio hydrological modeling exercise we tried to balance tradeoffs between generality realism and precision as argued by troy et al 2015 and aimed at providing practical insights for informed decision making in the watershed we therefore included detailed modeling processes for the infrastructure and irrigation components which define the capacity of irrigation facility and irrigation amount respectively by doing this the model can provide more realistic estimates for the economic analysis of irrigation sources and changes in the hydrology component on the other hand this has allowed the model to have a more detailed and complex structure and use scientifically verified outcomes on wastewater reuse in agriculture for example only the economic benefits of wastewater reuse in agriculture found from previous studies were used to model the economic processes associated with stage ii irrigation these benefits include a reduction in fertilization jeong et al 2014 water quality improvement jang et al 2012 and water resource acquisition yang and abbaspour 2007 in addition the economics function includes community sensitivity to the economic viability in the demand for stage ii irrigation to reflect a community trying to consider benefits that are difficult to quantify drechsel et al 2015 also a scenario based approach was used for the investment dimension rather than modeling it to have a state variable with an accumulation process and a tipping point thus allowing for surprise and uncertainty in the systems by doing so we were able to generate practical insights to determine the appropriate level of formal wastewater reuse in the watershed table 1 includes the additional rationale and comments explaining how previous studies on wastewater reuse have contributed to this model in this new version of the place based socio hydrological model we have revised the demand for stage ii irrigation that couples hydrological and social systems underpinning wastewater reuse in agriculture we newly included a water availability function and a modified economic function in the demand as presented in table 1 equation 2c due to the importance of water availability in an irrigated watershed elshafei et al 2014 water availability in the watershed can affect the demand for stage ii irrigation from an increase in effluent discharge and extreme hydrological conditions e g drought in the long run the water availability function see equation 2e in table 1 consists of available water calculated as ten year moving averages of the sums of stream water volume and groundwater volume as well as community sensitivity to water availability γ w for the economic function the formulation was changed to include community sensitivity γ e to the economic viability of wastewater reuse in agriculture see equation 2f in table 1 with these changes more flexible economic gradients on wastewater reuse can be considered the new formulation also helps maintain stage ii irrigation for a certain period under other irrigation sources i e groundwater which can be more economical than stage ii treated water this is an important consideration because stage ii irrigation can be uneconomical compared to other irrigation practices over short periods but can become more economical in the long run we also included greenhouse cultivation in land use change as an emerging trend of agricultural practice in the study area see equation 6e in table 1 greenhouse cultivation competes for quality irrigation water and reduces paddy fields a prominent consumer of stage ii irrigation in addition greenhouse cultivation has expanded and evolved to consume more quality irrigation water in south korea to produce crops with a higher market price such as tomatoes and paprika south korea s land area for greenhouse cultivation doubled from 1990 44 613 ha to 2015 90 468 ha and the study area is one of the largest greenhouse cultivation complexes in south korea including the land use change due to greenhouse cultivation helps to develop an informed understanding from which an agricultural wastewater reuse scheme can be expanded to a larger scale e g regional and national the inclusion of greenhouse cultivation in the model meant that the agricultural water demand for greenhouse crops had to be factored see equation 2b in table 1 into the demand component and the greenhouse irrigation see equation 4e in table 1 into the irrigation component 3 2 sensitivity analysis a modified deterministic approach was used to examine system behavior sensitivity to each model parameter to determine the most influential factors in the design of an agricultural wastewater reuse scheme in the study area this approach included relative sensitivity s r a sensitivity index s i and a general sensitivity degree index s which considers nonlinear characteristics of system behavior and overall system performance for the entire simulation period cho and mostaghimi 2009 hamby 1994 wei et al 2012 table 2 shows detailed descriptions of the parameters evaluated as more than slightly sensitive to at least one system in the sensitivity analysis even though social and hydrological systems of wastewater reuse in agriculture are coupled in our study we separated them by borrowing from traditional concepts used in both domains the hydrological system represents the hydrology component and the social system represents the demand irrigation and infrastructure components as shown in fig 3 the uncertainty parameters of population growth rate δ and per capita domestic water use ζ were added to the model to more easily demonstrate their uncertainties changes in input parameters resulting in model output variation can be described by the relative sensitivity to take into account the nonlinear behavior of model input parameters relative sensitivity was calculated at six different levels 50 25 10 10 25 and 50 from these six relative sensitivities a sensitivity index was calculated to determine the overall relative sensitivity of the output variables furthermore the degree of sensitivity of an input parameter to the output variables known as the general sensitivity degree index was calculated to evaluate the impacts that specific parameters may have on the target system wei et al 2012 stream flow interflow and base flow for the hydrological system hydrology component equations 16 17 and 18 and demand for stage ii irrigation demand component equation 2c facility capacity of stage ii irrigation infrastructure component equation 3a and groundwater irrigation irrigation component equation 4d for the social system were selected as target variables to represent each component and system the relative sensitivity sensitivity index and general sensitivity degree index are expressed by 8 s r δ o o b δ p p b where s r is relative sensitivity δ o is change in the output o b is base output δ p is a change in the parameter value and p b is the base parameter value 9 s i 1 n i 1 n s r i where s i is the sensitivity index n is the number of levels of parameter changes for s r and s r i is the relative sensitivity of level i 10 s 1 n i 1 n s i i where s is the general sensitivity degree index n is the number of variables and s i i is the sensitivity index of variable i the sensitivity of the tested parameter is determined from the classifications for relative sensitivity used by storm et al 1988 jesiek and wolfe 2005 and song et al 2016 insensitive s 0 01 slightly sensitive 0 01 s 0 10 moderately sensitive 0 10 s 1 00 sensitive 1 00 s 2 00 and extremely sensitive s 2 00 3 3 simulation scenarios to understand the different consequences of the complex interactions of socio hydrological systems we use a scenario based approach for the investment dimension rather than modeling it as a delayed response to socio hydrological systems this approach was chosen not only because of the complexity of the policy dimension gober and wheater 2015 but also to provide practical insights to determine the appropriate level of wastewater reuse five simulation scenarios were designed to assess the impacts of urbanization domestic water use and greenhouse cultivation table 3 ten simulation scenarios were constructed to demonstrate the impacts of wastewater reuse in agriculture on social and hydrological systems using target irrigation rate t and target stage ii irrigation rate s which determines the target amount of stage ii irrigation table 3 the korean government aims to irrigate 84 3 of paddy fields through irrigation facilities by 2020 ministry of land transport and maritime affairs mltm 2011 therefore a target irrigation rate of 85 was used as a baseline scenario of agricultural water supply and a target irrigation rate of 90 was used for future long term water resources planning a target stage ii irrigation rate of 50 was used as a baseline scenario and a range of 0 100 was tested to find the appropriate rate of wastewater reuse the baseline scenario t85s50 for example indicates that decision makers aimed to supply 85 of the agricultural water demand for paddy fields and that 50 of the required additional irrigation water used to meet the target irrigation rate is sourced from stage ii irrigation following sivapalan and blöschl 2015 for the place based socio hydrological models to generate possible future and associated probabilities a monte carlo simulation was employed to simulate possibility spaces to see the impacts of wastewater reuse in agriculture considering the changing agricultural environments uncertainty of population growth rate δ uncertainty of per capita domestic water demand ζ urbanization factor of paddy field f u r b p conversion factor of paddy field to greenhouse f c o n and crop factor of greenhouse cultivation f c r o p were used to simulate the impacts of changing agricultural environments and to construct scenarios with the monte carlo simulation each parameter is assumed to have a uniform distribution a range of ζ 0 8 1 2 was determined based on statistics from nearby cities for per capita domestic water use ranging from 257 to 451 l person 1 day 1 ministry of environment me 2016 and the dewatering of economic growth rock 2000 the per capita domestic water use in the study watershed is 295 l person 1 day 1 the upper and lower bounds of the possible future per capita domestic water use were lower than for nearby cities at 236 and 354 l person 1 day 1 respectively a range of f c r o p 0 5 1 5 was determined from the agricultural water consumption of the popular greenhouse crops grown in the study area namely zucchini 0 5 tomato 1 0 and paprika 1 5 unit irrigation rate for zucchini tomato and paprika in this area is 810 1430 and 2 230 mm year 1 respectively a range of δ 1 0 2 0 was selected after studying the steeper increasing rate of population growth in the study area compared to the rate provided by statistics korea sk 2011 for the study area and surrounding cities ranges of f u r b p 0 003 0 009 and f c o n 0 0005 0 002 were determined by analyzing land use maps produced between 2007 and 2009 for f c o n the upper and lower bounds of the possible future conversion factor were heightened compared to the baseline rate 0 005 to reflect the current rapid expansion of greenhouse cultivation in the study area a total of 200 simulations were generated for each scenario projected for 50 years 2011 2060 to show possible trajectories future climate data of the representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp 8 5 scenario was acquired from the korean meteorological administration and bias corrected for the study area using the method of alcamo et al 1997 4 results in this section we first identify the key parameters that are important for developing an agricultural wastewater reuse scheme through sensitivity analysis fig 4 second we investigate the impacts of changing agricultural environments figs 5 7 which the key parameters bring about on socio hydrological systems of wastewater reuse in agriculture third we explore the possibility space figs 8 11 to provide decision makers with practical insights in designing sustainable wastewater reuse strategies given the changing agricultural environments using a monte carlo simulation 4 1 sensitivity analysis parameters evaluated as more than slightly sensitive to at least one system are presented in fig 4 soil characteristics s c f c parameters representing runoff processes c s t r e a m c i n t c p e r c g r e and land cover r i n f n r i n f u r were moderately sensitive and had a large impact on the hydrological system in addition to hydrological factors well known for their impacts on the hydrological response chen et al 2013 social factors related to the investment dimension domestic water use and a regional farming characteristic had a large impact on the hydrological system target irrigation rate t i per capita domestic water demand ζ and crop coefficient of greenhouse cultivation f c r o p were all rated as moderately sensitive fig 4a as expected human activities significantly impacted the social system the parameters related to the investment dimension target irrigation rate and target stage ii irrigation rate were the most sensitive in the system and were evaluated as extremely sensitive and moderately sensitive respectively fig 4b the economics of irrigation practices c s o uncertainties of domestic water use and population change ζ δ and land use change f u r b p were moderately sensitive and significantly impacted the social system the coefficient of stream flow c s t r e a m was evaluated as moderately sensitive on the social system fig 4b this is because stream flow in the watershed can significantly alter the demand and the economics of stage ii irrigation by directly affecting the stream water and groundwater volumes and reuse ratio the results from the sensitivity analysis presented the key parameters affecting the model and showed the importance of considering uncertainty arising from changing agricultural environments when designing an agricultural wastewater reuse scheme which was directly represented by the investment dimension t i t s in this study changes to the agricultural environment in the study watershed can be attributed to urbanization domestic water use and greenhouse cultivation as they can be represented by the key parameters δ and f u r b p ζ and δ and f c r o p and f c o n respectively they varied on a relatively short time scale and had large uncertainties the impacts of changing agricultural environments are explored in the following section and parameter uncertainty is employed to construct the monte carlo simulations to see the possibility space of changes in the socio hydrological systems that investment decisions could cause although hydrological characteristics can have a large influence on socio hydrological systems in this watershed they are topographic parameters that vary over a very long time scale and were calibrated to properly reproduce the hydrological processes in the watershed parameters related to the economics of stage ii irrigation are left as initial values in the following sections since they reflect the current level of technology 4 2 the impacts of changing agricultural environments 4 2 1 urbanization the study watershed has undergone significant urbanization involving population growth and land use change generally this has led to greater demand for food and consequently agricultural water which may potentially raise the demand for agricultural wastewater reuse in the investment dimension therefore demand for agricultural wastewater reuse would increase as the population increases however at the urban watershed scale urbanization may reduce the demand for stage ii irrigation as it accompanies a decrease in agricultural land reducing agricultural water demand fig 5 nevertheless it requires a stage ii treatment system for a safe agricultural environment in the three urbanization scenarios p1 5u1 5 p1 5u1 0 baseline p1 5u0 5 paddy field area decreased to about 1 080 1 310 and 1 530 ha respectively to satisfy the target irrigation and stage ii irrigation rates the simulated average annual agricultural water demand for the three scenarios ranged from 15 83 to 20 98 million m 3 a difference that contributes to 27 9 of the baseline agricultural water demand 18 41 million m 3 while the simulated average annual demand for stage ii irrigation ranged from 1 25 to 1 65 million m 3 a difference that contributes to 27 5 of the baseline agricultural water demand 1 45 million m 3 increased domestic water use from urbanization could also partially contribute to reduced demand for stage ii irrigation by increasing water availability in the watershed fig 5c the demand for stage ii irrigation in the p2 0u1 0 scenario was similar to that of p1 5u1 5 while the agricultural water demand in the p2 0u1 0 scenario was larger than that of p1 5u1 5 simulation results showed that reducing agricultural land had a much larger and substantial impact on wastewater reuse in agriculture than urban population growth it is important to note that this is a result of a case study where the domestic water is supplied from outside the watershed the increased population from urbanization does not consume water from the watershed but only produces more effluent to the watershed which increases the water availability therefore the relationship between urbanization and the demand for stage ii irrigation at the watershed scale may be different from other regions furthermore the demand for stage ii irrigation will increase nationwide since population growth and economic development which increase quality water use vörösmarty et al 2000 are expected in south korea the increased demand for quality water necessitates securing alternative water sources like treated wastewater which plays a role as an exogenous factor to the watershed that raises the demand 4 2 2 domestic water use as the urban population consumes more domestic water stream flow in the urbanized watershed will increase fig 6a the simulated monthly average stream flow for the three per capita domestic water use scenarios p1 5w0 8 p1 5w1 0 baseline p1 5w1 2 ranged from 9 04 to 10 55 million m 3 a difference that constitutes about 15 4 of the baseline stream flow 9 81 million m 3 while that for the three population growth scenarios p1 0w1 0 p1 5w1 0 p2 0w1 0 ranged from 9 59 to 10 04 million m 3 a difference that constitutes about 4 5 of the baseline stream flow although increased stream flow might reduce stage ii irrigation due to a decrease in demand for stage ii irrigation from greater water availability the actual reuse amount of treated wastewater increased as per capita domestic water use increased fig 6 for example the simulated monthly average reuse amount of treated wastewater increased from 0 49 to 0 54 million m 3 as per capita domestic water use increased from 236 p1 5w0 8 to 354 l person 1 day 1 p1 5w1 2 meanwhile simulated monthly average stage ii irrigation decreased from 1 39 to 1 23 million m 3 fig 6d shows the importance of per capita domestic water use to determine the reuse ratio and the economics of stage ii irrigation a high reuse ratio can contribute to economically viable stage ii irrigation the monthly average cost of stage ii irrigation for p1 5w1 0 baseline p1 5w0 8 p1 5w1 2 p1 0w1 0 and p2 0w1 0 scenarios were 121 139 105 127 and 115 us dollars per thousand m 3 respectively for the simulation period all scenarios showed lower irrigation cost for stage ii irrigation than for groundwater irrigation cost as the monthly average cost of groundwater irrigation for baseline p1 5w0 8 p1 5w1 2 p1 0w1 0 and p2 0w1 0 scenarios were 207 207 208 208 and 206 us dollars per thousand m 3 respectively a difference in the monthly average cost of stage ii irrigation in the three per capita domestic water use scenarios was bigger than that in the three population growth scenarios as they ranged 12 9 15 5 and 5 0 5 1 from the baseline scenario respectively 4 2 3 greenhouse cultivation greenhouse cultivation which is an emerging agricultural opportunity due to its high profitability is one of the largest consumers of groundwater in south korea and is rapidly expanding in the study watershed simulation results from greenhouse cultivation scenarios showed that changes in crop type and rapid expansion of greenhouse cultivation could have a substantial impact on the hydrological system fig 7 the simulated monthly average groundwater volumes according to greenhouse cultivation scenarios c1 0g0 5 c1 0g1 0 c1 0g2 0 ranged from 1 18 to 1 63 million m 3 a difference that constitutes about 31 of the baseline c1 0g0 5 groundwater volume 1 40 million m 3 planting a more water consuming crop in the greenhouse had a large impact on the groundwater volume as shown by c1 5g0 5 paprika which had the same estimation of future greenhouse area as the baseline c1 0g0 5 tomato which was estimated at 1 18 million m 3 similar to that of c1 0g2 0 tomato on the other hand greenhouse cultivation had a relatively small impact on wastewater reuse in agriculture even if it could significantly change groundwater volume affecting the demand for stage ii irrigation and reduce the paddy field area fig 7 this is because the groundwater volume in the study area represents only 12 of the total available water volume i e sum of stream water and groundwater volume that the watershed can produce the estimated average annual demands for stage ii irrigation ranged from 1 38 to 1 48 million m 3 a difference that constitutes about 7 of the baseline demand 1 45 million m 3 the decrease in the paddy field area due to greenhouse expansion had a larger impact than groundwater consumption by greenhouse cultivation on wastewater reuse in agriculture if the community in the watershed evolves towards a society sensitive to water availability particularly groundwater availability then the impacts of greenhouse cultivation would rise 4 3 the possibility space 4 3 1 hydrology indirect wastewater reuse directly affected stream flow by consuming irrigation water from the stream that received the treated effluent monthly mean stream flow for t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 baseline t85s75 and t85s100 scenarios for the simulation period were estimated to range from 9 73 to 9 79 million m 3 fig 8 a difference that constitutes about 0 6 of the baseline stream flow 9 76 million m 3 and indicates that indirect wastewater reuse had little influence on stream flow this is due to the seasonality of stream flow in the watershed in which stream flow is several times higher during the irrigation period than the normal flow jeong et al 2016b this mitigates the impact of stage ii irrigation on the stream water and causes the volume of stream flow to be significantly larger than that of intake volume simulation results showed that irrigating predominantly with groundwater led to locally unsustainable use of groundwater while stage ii irrigation could contribute to sustainable groundwater use fig 8 simulated monthly mean groundwater volumes of t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 baseline t85s75 and t85s100 ranged from 1 20 to 1 43 million m 3 a difference that constitutes about 18 of the baseline groundwater volume 1 31 million m 3 for the simulation period the results of these scenarios showed that an additional source of irrigation water should be made available to prevent groundwater exploitation if the government wants to meet its target irrigation rate of about 85 for scenarios with lower target stage ii irrigation rates t85s00 t85s25 t90s00 and t90s25 the groundwater volume dropped continuously and in some cases showed a negative value indicating that groundwater usage surpassed capacity in the study watershed therefore for the government target irrigation rate to be reached developing a stage ii irrigation facility to supply more than 50 of the required additional irrigation water is recommended to maintain a sustainable groundwater volume and ensure quality irrigation water in the future 4 3 2 demand for wastewater reuse the demand for stage ii irrigation reflected the target irrigation rate and target stage ii irrigation rate fig 9 estimates for the average annual demands of t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 baseline t85s75 and t85s100 scenarios were 0 00 0 73 1 44 2 15 and 2 85 million m 3 respectively for the simulation period the uncertainties implicit in coupled human and water systems had a large impact on the demand as the target stage ii irrigation rate increased fig 9 a large uncertainty in the demand occurred when the annual demand exceeded that of the baseline scenario this was mainly caused by uncertainty in agricultural water demand depending on land use change and partially caused by water availability related to domestic water use the demands tended to decrease until the 2020s when agricultural land continually declined due to urban expansion and the decline increased as the target stage ii irrigation rate rose a conservative approach for the design of a stage ii irrigation facility is needed to avoid excessive development especially for scenarios t85s75 t85s100 t90s75 and t90s100 4 3 3 irrigation facility facilities capable of irrigating with groundwater and stage ii water were needed to meet the required agricultural water supply the two irrigation capacities had a complementary relationship that ensured an adequate supply of the required additional irrigation water estimated required monthly facility capacities for groundwater irrigation were 0 55 0 42 0 29 0 16 and 0 11 million m 3 for t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 baseline t85s75 and t85s100 respectively fig 10 for stage ii irrigation the estimated required monthly facility capacities were 0 00 0 20 0 39 0 59 and 0 78 million m 3 for the same scenarios respectively fig 10 considering the simulation results for groundwater volume the facility capacities of t85s50 t85s75 and t85s100 for stage ii irrigation indicated an appropriate development capacity for the wastewater reuse scheme in this watershed to sustain and increase groundwater volume and enable downstream groundwater irrigation of greenhouse cultivation furthermore in the long run simulation results of total net present irrigation cost showed that increasing the stage ii irrigation facility capacity would not always result in an increase in irrigation costs even though it could increase the uncertainty in the economics of stage ii irrigation fig 10 the estimated net present irrigation costs to supply the target irrigation rate of t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 t85s75 and t85s100 scenarios were 5 79 5 87 5 94 5 99 and 5 69 million us dollars in 2060 respectively even for scenarios targeting 100 of stage ii irrigation water for the required additional irrigation water t85s100 t90s100 the estimated net present irrigation costs were found to be less expensive than not implementing an agricultural wastewater reuse practice i e t85s00 and t90s00 in the watershed therefore implementing 100 of stage ii irrigation for the additional irrigation would be the most economically favorable option for this watershed 4 3 4 irrigation amount estimates for the annual average amount of groundwater irrigation for the simulation period were 1 80 1 42 1 03 0 64 and 0 20 million m 3 for the t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 baseline t85s75 and t85s100 scenarios respectively fig 11 the amounts drastically decreased as stage ii irrigation increased and for the t85s100 scenario existing groundwater irrigation facilities in the watershed were sufficient estimated average annual amounts of stage ii irrigation were 0 00 0 65 1 29 1 92 and 2 55 million m 3 for t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 t85s75 and t85s100 respectively fig 11 as stage ii irrigation increased the agricultural water deficit which refers to the shortage of agricultural water compared to the target irrigation rate was reduced the estimated average annual agricultural water deficits of the t85s00 t85s25 t85s50 t85s75 and t85s100 scenarios were 1 22 0 95 0 68 0 43 and 0 25 million m 3 respectively for the simulation period in the t85s00 scenario the estimated deficit was about five times larger than the deficit of the t85s100 scenario for scenarios targeting 100 of stage ii irrigation water for the required additional irrigation water t85s100 t90s100 the deficit lasted only until the 2010s and occurred only under severe drought conditions after that fig 11 this indicated that the target irrigation rate could be achieved faster and be more stable by increasing the amount of stage ii irrigation the results also show that a stable supply of agricultural water could be achieved through the diversification of irrigation water sources 5 discussion and conclusions wastewater reuse in agriculture is becoming inevitable worldwide due to increasing levels of urbanization on the supply or opportunity side and the worsening of freshwater shortages facing these challenges south korea and its government have adopted the policy of encouraging the use of advanced stage ii water treatment systems for safe wastewater reuse in agriculture this initiative is driven by coupled human and water systems dynamics dynamic elements of the systems such as demand for irrigation water agricultural practices and surface and groundwater hydrology are complex and their coupling makes decision making difficult our study is based on an extension of the place based socio hydrological model of jeong and adamowski 2016 to investigate the possibility space for future trajectories of system dynamics we use the model to develop knowledge that can help decision makers to make informed choices on the design of sustainable wastewater reuse strategies in south korea and beyond based on our model analysis we identified a set of key parameters that cause significant uncertainties in the model system dynamics we explored the influences of these key parameters on the agricultural wastewater reuse system the identified key parameters concern the characteristics of urbanization domestic water use and changes in agricultural practices the model simulation provided key insights first our results show that urbanization can reduce the demand for stage ii irrigation within an urbanizing watershed accelerated urbanization has been known to increase informal indirect reuse trinh et al 2013 and wastewater reuse due to intensified water competition united nations world water assessment programme unwwap 2017 our results however show that urbanization with land use change and population growth can reduce the area under agricultural cultivation as well as increase water availability from increased effluent discharge within an urbanizing watershed thus these two factors may contribute to an overall decrease in the demand for stage ii irrigation this result suggests that careful consideration of future land use changes is required when considering the development of stage ii irrigation facilities within an urbanized area second our model results show that domestic water use in urban areas can have a significant effect on the economics of wastewater reuse in agriculture an increase in domestic water use led to an increase in the actual reuse amount of wastewater through indirect reuse by increasing the proportion of treated wastewater in irrigation water this enhanced the economics of stage ii irrigation compared with urbanization and associated population growth changes in the pattern of domestic water use i e per capita domestic water use may have a greater effect on the economics of stage ii irrigation this is because the amount of treated wastewater consumed by stage ii irrigation can decrease if the per capita domestic water use decreases even though the population is increasing this result suggests that stage ii irrigation in countries or regions with higher domestic water consumption per capita can be more economically viable for indirect wastewater reuse it also indicates that changes in per capita domestic water use may be more important in planning stage ii irrigation than the increase or decrease in population third the influences of changes in agricultural practices on wastewater reuse can vary depending on the sensitivity of the community to water availability and the regional hydrological conditions greenhouse cultivation an emerging agricultural practice in the study area and which mostly consumes groundwater influenced the demand for stage ii irrigation mainly by reducing water availability from streams and groundwater the expansion of the greenhouse area and the choice of cultivated crops could pose a major threat to the groundwater resources of the watershed since groundwater volume is much smaller than stream water volume in this case the impact of greenhouse cultivation on overall water availability was small and consequently had little effect on wastewater reuse in agriculture however the influence of greenhouse cultivation on wastewater reuse in agriculture could be greater if the community in the watershed evolves to have a greater concern for water availability this result suggests that in areas where there is a lack of water or a high level of awareness of water availability changes in agricultural practices that consume a lot of water could be an important factor in wastewater reuse we also explored the possibility space of future trajectories of system dynamics that result from different investment choices the scenario where 100 of the required additional irrigation water was supplied through stage ii irrigation t85s100 appeared to be the best option to meet the target irrigation rate set by the government for this particular watershed the t85s100 scenario preserved 270 000 m 3 more groundwater per month on average which is about 20 of the monthly average groundwater volume that the study watershed can produce than the scenario not using stage ii irrigation t85s00 moreover the t85s100 scenario achieved the target irrigation rate in a shorter period of time and was more stable than other scenarios because it was consistently able to meet the target irrigation rate except during severe drought conditions ultimately the estimated facility capacity of stage ii irrigation for scenario t85s100 was about 780 000 m 3 per month about 29 of the annual average demand for stage ii irrigation in this scenario it may not be economical however to develop stage ii irrigation facilities to the full estimated capacity in the scenarios due to implicit uncertainties involved in urbanization the estimated net present irrigation cost for the t85s100 scenario was also found to be less expensive than that of t85s00 the findings regarding the possibility spaces have a few implications for wastewater reuse in agriculture first stage ii irrigation can diversify irrigation water sources and relieve agricultural water deficits this reduces the chance of depleting water resources projected possibility spaces show that stage ii irrigation can preserve groundwater volume in the study watershed this result is in line with the study conducted by murray and ray 2010 which showed that wastewater reuse could conserve millions of tons of water in local rivers each year the diversification of irrigation water sources can also enhance the resilience of agricultural systems to reliably produce agricultural products under global change despite the large inter annual variations in the possibility space of hydrology demand and irrigation components mostly due to future climate change agricultural water deficit occurs very rarely when sufficient stage ii irrigation is available second stage ii irrigation could be an economically viable option for indirect wastewater reuse when targeting paddy rice cultivation the possibility spaces show that stage ii irrigation that uses a decentralized advanced treatment system can guide informal indirect reuse as an economically sound agricultural practice this suggests that there is room for improvement in wastewater reuse in agriculture even in countries with well maintained wastewater treatment facilities and relatively rich surface water resources overall our observations show that stage ii irrigation may help achieve the sustainable development goal of better managing water to sustain people and the environment through improvements in the sustainable use and development of water resources and wastewater management malik et al 2015 under changing agricultural environments related to urbanization and climate variability few socio hydrological models have been used to design an actual water policy rather the models have so far mainly focused on the understanding of human behaviors to flood dynamics and tradeoffs in water use chen et al 2016 di baldassarre et al 2013 kandasamy et al 2014 liu et al 2015 yu et al 2017 on the other hand this study demonstrates how socio hydrological models can be useful in designing a wastewater reuse scheme an important component in water cycle dynamics that can significantly alter the hydrological regime srinivasan et al 2017 jeong et al 2016b nevertheless models are opinions embedded in mathematics o neil 2016 and our model is based on experiences with our study site in south korea for these reasons this study has several limitations for example the representation of the investment dimension was simplified and as a result a scenario based approach was needed to explore the possible effects of different investment decisions as such we could not explore the dynamics of social awareness and acceptance of wastewater reuse our model also relies on overly detailed relationships between human and water systems with respect to wastewater reuse this resulted in relatively restricted dynamics in the interactions between system components in a future study a more stylized model building on our work could be developed to gain more general insights regarding social response to changing agricultural environments this additional step would build off the understanding of wastewater reuse issues presented in this study and would also prove worthwhile for guiding future water reuse
