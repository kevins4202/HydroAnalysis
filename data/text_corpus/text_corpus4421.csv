property can change the load bearing ratio especially when the compartment plates are involved the lid bearing mode is dominant for cbf when the upper layer of the soil is high in strength without the compartment plates the bucket wall contributes more than the lid the load bearing behavior is influenced by the bucket diameter soil strength and the compartment plates the results are of reference value to understand the load bearing behaviors and serve as a basis for optimizing the structure design for cost reduction keywords load bearing behavior composite bucket foundation offshore wind soil profile parametric analyses 1 introduction the development of offshore wind energy is picking up speed worldwide and the supporting foundations are also confronted with challenges from the ascending capacity of wind turbines which need greater bearing capacity and adaptability oh et al 2018 wang et al 2018 2019a among these traditional supporting structures such as mono pile gravity based foundations tripod frame and jacket the suction bucket foundation has been more and more focused as a promising alternative bransby and yun 2009 watson et al 2000 wang et al 2019b for one hand the suction bucket foundation is eco friendly simple in construction and installation besides it is widely adaptable to soil conditions and less in need of scour protection and seabed preparation randolph and house 2002 different from the traditional concept of suction bucket foundations a new type of wide shallow large scale composite bucket foundation cbf was proposed by tianjin university and daoda company see in fig 1 the 2 5 mw prototype of the cbf was used for the first offshore wind turbine prototype in the qidong sea area of jiangsu province of china in 2010 and now more larger size offshore wind turbines with this composite bucket foundation have been installed in sanxia offshore wind farm of jiangsu province of china in 2019 many research works have been done on suction bucket foundations exploring the challenges in costs and presenting simple design calculations houlsby and byrne 2000 byrne and houlsby 2006 fu et al 2015 the main issues for that are mono direction load bearing capacity barari and ibsen 2012 and cyclical lateral loadings induced dynamic responses zhang et al 2007 2010 the bearing performances involved with different soil properties were investigated by laboratory and field tests and reported in details and the critical failure mechanism was discussed with the yield envelope and the upper bound or lower bound analyses randolph and house 2002 houlsby et al 2005 yun and bransby 2007 fu et al 2020 numerical studies have been carried out on both the bucket foundation and the cbf for the application and verification of fem early in 1999 erbrich and tjelta had presented a series of finite element analyses by abaqus and compared that with extensive model tests on the installation of suction caissons in sand erbrich and tjelta 1999 both experimental and numerical results suggest the same degradation of the tip resistance tran and randolph 2008 also conducted model tests on the variation of suction pressure in dense sand and further compared that with finite element simulations they suggested that fe analyses appeared to explain this observation well and a consistent pattern of behavior was established for all the model and field data achmus et al 2013 validated the numerical model abaqus by carrying out back calculation of experimental field tests reported in literature the back calculations show that the finite element simulation is capable of realistically modelling the load bearing behavior of a bucket foundation in sand under monotonic horizontal loading experimental and finite element analyses were conducted by li et al 2015 on the bearing capacities of modified suction caissons mscs in sand under static horizontal loading which verified the numerical modelling by the back analysis of the moment rotation curves liu et al 2017 studied the lateral bearing capacity of bucket foundations by tests and fem the test and fem results were compared in terms of the earth pressure to analyze the failure mechanism of instability apart from that numerical studies specifically on cbf have been conducted and verified with model tests on the load bearing capacities ding et al 2015a 2015b liu et al 2018 jia et al 2018 they carried out model test in clay and silt soil to investigate the envelope curve of ultimate bearing capacity in different load space the main failure mode and the center of rotation of the structure that the strengthened silt by negative pressure inside the bucket can improve the bearing capacity has been concluded based on the test and numerical results it is also suggested that with proper elasticity modulus of the soils the load displacement relationships obtained using fem simulations are almost in same trend with the test results while the load bearing behaviors of the cbf due to the inside configuration has not been illustrated the features of the new load bearing mode induced by internal soil structure interaction needs to be accounted for on the other hand for the configuration of cbf the pre stressing arc transition piece design can effectively solve the stress transformation from the big moment at the top of the transition part to limited tensile compressive stress at the bottom lian et al 2012 it was further compared with the line type transition piece on the bearing mode and the force transfer paths by both theory and the finite element methods zhang et al 2016 he et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 a the results show the arc shape transition section exhibits a better mechanical characteristic and prove its significance in eliminating the force concentration thus the arc shape concrete transition piece shown in figs 2 and 3 is modeled in the numerical model in this paper with a reasonable subdivision compartments inside the one step installation technique of the cbf was proved to be economical and efficient ding et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 2015 and the compartment plates involved with seepage issues can influence the bearing capacity of the cbf zhang et al 2017 b 2018 hu et al 2018 which prompts the necessity for considering the compartment plates in this analysis moreover the loading bearing capacity for cbf has been studied with consideration of silt and sand soil conditions and a top cover bearing mode was concluded for muddy soil lian et al 2011 based on that the load bearing mode is focused in this study in this paper the load bearing behaviors of cbf with an arc transition piece were studied by the numerical method to clarify the impacts of the compartment plates two configurations are described see in figs 2 and 3 and analyzed namely cbf 1 cbf 2 two sets of dimensions of the cbf designed for 3 mw and 6 mw offshore wind turbines are adopted the height of cbf is shallow which makes the upper layer of soil very important for analyzing the bearing behaviors these models are not only various in embedded soil properties but also in combined environment loadings the results based on these coupled factors are more representative to observe the load bearing behavior the details of geometry and property parameters are introduced in section 2 in section 3 the load transferring mechanism and load bearing mode are investigated in terms of the deformations of cbf and soil the contact pressure between cbf and soil around is integrated to compare the load bearing ratio the effects of the dimensions and the configurations are analyzed in section 4 finally the main ideas are concluded in section 5 2 numerical models 2 1 structure soil interaction soil structure interaction can be considered by using equivalent linear spring models distributed nonlinear spring models continuum element models oh et al 2018 for homogeneous soil the soil strength is modeled as linear spring due to its small deformation which is effective for feasibility analysis as for the distributed nonlinear soil models the distributed springs represented by three load deflection curves have been presented in codes such as api dnv american petroleum institute 2005 det norske veritas 2011 continuum element models of soil have been proposed to account for soil structure interaction and several numerical models are available like mohr coulomb duncan chang plaxis harding soil et al ti et al 2009 mohr coulomb model a simple elastic perfectly plastic constitutive model is the most common model in the context of geomaterials and in particular soils pietruszczak 2010 it requires only about three or four parameters that can be readily derived from common soil laboratory tests to incorporate elastoplastic behavior through the use of a frictional yield surface toh et al 2019 the contact properties to simulate the interaction of bucket foundation with soil in abaqus include a normal direction effect and a tangential direction effect estimated by coulombs friction law there is no slip on the contact surface between foundation and soil when the shear stress is less than the ultimate value 2 2 finite element model finite element method is adopted in this paper and analyses were conducted using the abaqus software simulia 2010 the first order eight node brick element with reduced integration c3d8r was used to model the soil and the bucket foundation the mesh convergence analyses were performed at first to obtain the optimal number of elements around sixty thousand to eighty thousand for following analyses the numerical model includes a concrete transition piece and a steel bucket foundation the steel bucket foundation is modeled as one piece thus no contact property needs to be defined the contact property is defined as the tied contact for the transition piece and the steel bucket foundation the tied contact defined here indicates that nodes on the master and the slave surfaces have the same values of displacement given that the relative deformation on the interface is negligible therefore adopting the tied contact property here is reasonable 2 2 1 composite bucket foundation cbf 1 the cbf 1 is shown in fig 2 which includes an arc shape concrete transition piece and a shallow steel suction caisson the geometry parameters are listed in table 1 the listed dimensional parameters for this cbf 1 are designed for a 3 mw offshore wind turbine as shown in fig 2 the height of bucket wall is changed locating at different soil layers 2 2 2 composite bucket foundation cbf 2 the configuration of cbf 2 is demonstrated in fig 3 there are three main parts the concrete transition piece the steel bucket foundation the compartment plates these compartment plates divide the bucket into seven compartments which is beneficial for controlling and leveling the suction process and enhancing the bearing capacity the wind turbine is connected with the transition piece via flanges the height of transition piece is alterable based on the water depth in design sea area the information about the dimensional parameters of cbf 2 has been shown in table 2 overall the dimensions listed in tables 1 and 2 for cbf are determined by the power generating capacity of the supported wind turbines which are 3 mw and 6 mw in this paper the diameters of 30 m and 32 m are designed for 3 mw wind turbines while for 6 mw wind turbines cbfs are generally designed with a diameter no less than 35 m 2 2 3 soil model soil properties are complicated in offshore wind farm especially in china as a wide shallow structure the surface soil property can be important in dominant load bearing mode for cbf therefore layered soil conditions are concerned coupled with the dimensional effects of cbfs cbf 1 and cbf 2 the load bearing ratios and deformations are analyzed as for cbf 1 the soil condition is the same for different models as shown in table 3 and fig 2 while for cbf 2 four groups of soil profiles are chosen and combined with four groups of diameters see in table 4 and fig 4 2 3 combined loading fig 5 demonstrates the combined loading condition which includes the wind turbine loads m h v and equivalent wave loading the soil model was set up with a diameter five times as that of the bucket foundation to eliminate the boundary effect by finite element method the finite element mesh used in the present study is shown to provide a better view of inside features and the mesh fig 5 shows the whole structure with a half section the numerical simulations are carried out with the whole models displacements at the bottom boundary were fully fixed for six degrees of freedom while for the lateral boundary condition the vertical motion is allowed as well as the rotation along two horizontal axes this combined loading environment is typical and representative for offshore wind foundation structures to make the simulation results meaningful in understanding the load bearing behaviors of the cbf 3 deformation analyses the load bearing behavior is a classical problem in offshore engineering which can be investigated through the three dimensional deformations of structure and soil around based on soil structure interaction 3 1 deformation of cbf the structure deformations for cbf 1 and cbf 2 are analyzed from two perspectives horizontal displacement and rotation first the deformation of cbf 1 is compared the combined loadings are constant for four models with different wall height four positions on the bucket lid are chosen to show the overall deformations of cbf 1s as shown in fig 6 notice that the bending moment exerts the same effect as the horizontal load dose on the foundation that is in cartesian coordinate system the bending moment is in the positive direction of y axis if the horizontal load is in the positive direction of x axis the target positions are chosen based on that the deformations are obtained vertically at these points in fig 6 the penetration depth of cbf 1 is defined as vertical axis the variation of the deformations resulted from the height of bucket wall shows a clear distinction the maximum lateral displacement decreases significantly from 18 cm to 5 cm by around 70 as the increase of the penetration depth which increases by a relative lower percentage of 62 from 7 4 m to 12 m because the wall provides the most lateral resistance and bears the uplift load transferred from transition piece especially when the wall passes through the second layer to the third layer a soft layer where the cohesive stress is much larger then the deformation decreases the most the displacement at point 3 at the passive soil pressure region shows clear divergence near to the bottom of bucket wall this may because that soil inside the bucket wall is compacted more providing resistance force for bucket wall however when the wall penetrates through the layer this resistance is limited the structure rotation at these chosen positions shows similar patterns in lateral for point 2 and 4 they have the same rotation angle which drops down as the increase of bucket wall however along point 1 and 3 the rotation angles fluctuate around the rotation level of point 2 and 4 a slight difference is that the point 1 at the active region of soil pressure shows less variation than point 3 does in passive region of soil pressure this is because that the soil outside the bucket wall around point 1 withstands the horizontal deformation and provided more resistance than the inside soil moreover the back and forth rotation patterns shown by point 1 and 3 may indicated a local buckling issue which can be eliminated by adding assistant stiffeners generally the rotation along bucket wall changes more significantly at the bottom than at the top this indicates a suitable location for adding stiffener to enhance the structure stiffness and bearing capacity as for cbf 2 the features of displacement and rotation angle are quite different from that of cbf 1 five different diameters are compared and the deformation is analyzed in respect to twelve positions as shown in fig 7 points 1 6 at the intersection of compartment plates represent the deformation of the mid compartment while points 11 66 represent that of the bucket wall the depth of each soil layer is indicated by the dash line as shown in fig 7 from fig 7 the horizontal displacement at twelve points is more consistent with larger diameters the maximum displacement will reduce however this is not the case in soil with lower strength as shown in fig 7 d and e where the diameter is larger and the deformation is also larger with compartment plates inside the bucket and soil interactions are intensified and the strength of the surface soil should be more concerned a slight growth of displacement can be observed due to the growth in diameter even the soil profile is the same this is unexpected as the larger diameter has a stronger soil resistance and then smaller displacement given limited model samples here the reason is unable to be explained besides the horizontal displacement at the bottom of bucket wall shows a much smaller variation because the compartment plates bear a portion of loads the rotations of compartment plates and bucket wall vary obviously the largest rotation occurs with the smallest diameter which also shows the most significant fluctuation considering smaller soil resistance for the smallest diameter this deformation is reasonable when the same loads are applied the points 1 6 seem to have larger rotation angle than that of points 11 66 bucket wall and the fluctuations are slightly intenser for most diameters it indicates the deformation is larger inside the bucket foundation because the overall deformation is partly shouldered by these thinner compartment plates the rotation fluctuates less at the lower height even the rotation at the top and bottom is bigger than that around the middle height the back and forth rotation patterns for both the wall and the compartment plates may indicate a buckling issue the variation of rotation angle in sand around 0 5 rad is larger than that in muddy and clay soil around 0 3 rad which can be account for by the cohesive stress 3 2 deformation of soil the soil settlement and horizontal displacement under combined loadings are analyzed in this section the settlement and displacement were compared for different layers at the direction of the horizontal load x axis referred as solid lines in fig 8 these dash lines refer to deformations in y axis the term location in fig 8 indicates the distance to the soil center and the legend shows the depth of each line measured from the soil surface in meters again the coordinate system is a cartesian coordinate system in which z axis is positive upward from fig 8 the soil deformations of cbf 1 are quite brief the displacement of surface layers inside the bucket wall is positive and increased from the very center of the soil model to the bucket wall however in deep layers soil motions are different regardless of the outside deformation the lateral displacement is minimum at the center and maximum at the wall this is because the motion of the soil inside the bucket wall is confined and compressed more especially at the center where the deformation is limited there is a distinct drop of the deformations at the bucket wall from inside to outside which also suggests that movement of soil inside the bucket wall is controlled by the structure deformation at the direction of y axis the deformation of soil is much smaller as well as the differences between the center and the side this is because the deformation follows the load direction and has less impacts on the normal direction y axis inside soil is compressed resulting in a consistent rotation motion which turning forward at the surface and backward at the bottom as for the soil settlement concise features can be concluded from the inside and outside perspectives the soil settlement at the center is negative and it varies linearly to the wall in positive axis soil motion is downwards and larger than that in the other side where soil motion is upwards which proves the rotation trend due to the bending moment a significant change can be seen at the wall from the inside to the outside soil settlement drops rapidly outside to a placid level since the soil pressure transferred and dissipates to a wider rage inside the bucket wall the settlement curves at y axis are negative and close to each other in general soil deformation shows an obvious sensitive region about 1 2 times of the diameter as the bucket foundation the deformation is quite limited beyond this region moreover deformations in the y axis are much lower than that in the x axis it indicates that soil reinforcement measure can be more effective inside the bucket wall and soil protections conducted in the certain region should be sufficient the soil deformation for cbf 2 exhibits a clear distinction compared with that for cbf 1 due to the compartment plates as shown in fig 9 the lateral displacement of soil inside the bucket wall is positive and increased a little from the very center to the wall regardless of the outside deformation the lateral displacement shows a diminishing variation from the center and to the wall as diameter growth besides there is also a distinct drop at the bucket wall from inside to outside this suggests that the motion of soil inside the bucket wall is more agreed with the structure deformation because of the compartmet plates that is the compartment plates increase the inside interaction between soil and structure thus the resistance is improved as for the soil settlement it is negative at the center and it varies linearly to the wall in x axis in positive axis soil motion is downwards and larger than the other side where soil motion is upwards a significant change can be seen from the inside to the outside of the wall where soil settlement decreases rapidly to a placid level the reason is the same as mentioned before the settlement curves at y axis are negative and the difference is more clear and larger between the center compartment and side ones this indicates that the soil inside is motivated by these compartment plates and it is more obvious with larger diameters since deformations in mid compartment are much larger in general soil deformations of cbf are obviously influenced by compartment plates the deformation inside the wall is more agreed and it is reduced rapidly to a limited amount beyond a certain region around 1 2 d outside moreover displacements in the y axis are comparatively closer to that in the x axis 3 3 load bearing behaviors the large horizontal force and bending moment transferred from the arc shape transaction piece to the bucket lid and further to bucket wall and compartment plates these compartments can enhance the bearing capacity of bucket foundations however the contributions to the overall load bearing capacity from each component bucket lid bucket wall and compartment plates are not clear yet since it is hard to be obtained from experiment results the dominant bearing mode is quantified by a proposed parameter load bearing ratio it is the weight of the stress integral contact pressure on each component note that in the active region of soil pressure the outside surface of the bucket wall may play a major role but in the passive region inside surface supported by the compressed soil is more important besides they mainly contribute in horizontal direction the bucket lid takes a major place in the vertical direction the stress integral of each part is found in their dominant directions even though the bearing capacity of each part dominants in different direction the combined effects should be the same when the same eternal loads are applied then the contribution from each part can be calculated and compared by their weights load bearing ratio e for instance the weight of bucket lid is found as 1 e 1 σ 1 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 100 where σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 are the stress integral of bucket lid wall and plates respectively under the combined loading state the stress integral is obtained by integrating the contact pressure on the surface of each component figs 10 and 11 demonstrate the load bearing ratios of each part for cbf 2 and cbf 1 respectively fig 10 compares the load bearing ratios of the bucket lid bucket wall and compartment plates for cbf 2 with different diameters in fig 10 a d the surface soil is sand and the bucket lid plays a major role since its load bearing ratio is over 60 the bucket wall takes the second place with a weight around 25 the compartment plates take the least proportion especially when the bucket wall height is short suggested by fig 10 d this is reasonable because the cohesive stress is small for sand and the area of interface providing the lateral resistance is shorten in this case as a result the bearing ratio decreases as for fig 10 e g it changes significantly that the bucket lid plays a descending role and finally the load bearing ratio becomes less than 20 however the bucket wall and the compartment plates are increased to an equal value around 40 this can be accounted for by the variation of soil property of surface layers as shown in table 1 the surface layer of soil is sand for diameter of 30 m 32 m and 35 m ① ② while for the rest it is the muddy and clay soil with lower strength considering the cohesive stress is larger for clay therefore the interaction is enhanced and the deformation of this layer is small which makes the bucket wall and compartment plates more mobilized as shown in fig 11 for cbf 1 with the same diameter and the same soil condition load bearing ratios are much clear since only two parts are involved generally the bucket wall plays a larger role than the bucket lid regardless of the wall heights the load bearing ratios of bucket wall and the lid are quite close especially when the wall is shorter in order to clarify the impact of the soil property the first layer of soil for cbf 1 with a wall height of 7 4 m is changed into the muddy silt clay the same parameter as that in cbf 2 with diameter of 37 m the load bearing ratios for the bucket wall and bucket lid are 54 94 and 45 05 respectively it is close to that shown in fig 11 d wall 55 22 lid 44 78 it suggests that the load bearing capacity of cbf 1 is less sensitive to the surface soil property compared with cbf 2 the differences in the contribution weight of each component are complicated because the definition of this weight load bearing ratio has a drawback that is only the dominant direction is considered to find the stress integral however for example the wall and plates can also bear the vertical load which is neglect in this analysis moreover the compartment plates change the interaction between structure and soil and it increases the integrity of the wall and the lid therefore the dominant load bearing mode is different for cbf 1 and cbf 2 in general it is reasonable to conclude that the compartment plates can change the load bearing mode from the wall dominant cbf 1 to the bucket lid dominate cbf 2 except for the silt clay soil condition 4 parametric study 4 1 diameter of cbf in section 3 the deformations and load bearing ratio of bucket foundations cbf 1 and cbf 2 are analyzed but the relations with dimensional features are not illustrated therefore in this section the load bearing behaviors varying with diameters are studied as shown in figs 12 14 fig 12 shows the soil deformation percentage at different locations the deformation percentage is defined as the real deformation at each location over the maximum deformation of soil these locations demonstrated in fig 12 are named as center plate wall 1 0d and 2 0d respectively the name vertical in fig 12 b means the point is at the direction vertical to the horizontal load in addition the load direction applied in these models is different in fig 12 a the percentage of displacement decreases significantly from the bucket wall 90 to the distance of 1 0d 16 and finally it becomes limited beyond the region of 2 0d this indicates that in soil the load dissipates rapidly to a wider range outside the wall any soil protection and strengthen strategies would be more effective within this range it is noticeable that when the diameter is larger the maximum displacement shows at the plate instead of the bucket wall as suggested by models with smaller diameters this is probably because that the soft property of surface soil transfers larger proportion of loadings to the wall and compartment plates another reason may relate to the load direction fig 12 a since the compartment plates are in the vertical position to the direction of the loads which makes it contribute more the larger diameter it is the greater reduction and the smaller percentage of displacement are shown in the region between 1 0d and 2 0d the soil settlement referred here dose not indicate the direction of movement and it is the absolute value therefore the values are positive as fig 12 b shown the outside settlement is limited beyond a round region of 1 0d less than 10 the maximum settlement occurs at the compartment plate for large dimeter d 36 m and 37 m while for other smaller diameters it shows at the bucket wall it is related to the soft soil property which has a larger interface with the compartment plates and bigger cohesive stress leading to a higher load bearing ratio and a larger settlement the soil settlements are less than 30 for diameter within 35 m at center and vertical locations however it is much larger around 55 for the rest two diameters of cbf 2 this suggests that with smaller diameters the soil inside the bucket wall are more compressed and constrained leading to comparatively smaller deformations in fig 13 the load bearing ratio and the bucket rotation are compared considering the impact of diameters it is clear that larger diameters lead to a relative higher proportion of load distribution and the rotation on the lid the load bearing ratio of the bucket wall basically takes the second place around 30 for smaller diameters and 40 for larger diameters the compartment plates contribute the least when the diameter is small the diameter of 35 m seems to be a turning point for the dominant bearing mode in that the last three curves with identical soil profiles show opposite features for load bearing ratios because the height of the bucket wall is also different in these cases the single factor analysis may not be quite clear as anticipated as for the structure rotation differences are very small among the three components however the impacts from the change of diameter are significant the large diameter enhances the vertical bearing capacity by increasing the interface area and leads to a smaller rotation angle but if the surface soil is silt clay then cbf 2 shows the largest rotation with the largest diameter as explained in that case the bucket wall and compartment plates play larger roles in load bearing accounting for bigger deformations 4 2 height of bucket wall for cbf 2 three groups of wall height are considered 10 m d 30 m 35 m ① ③ 36 m 37 m 12 m d 32 m 7 5 m d 35m ② for cbf 1 four groups of wall height are considered 12 m 9 4 m 8 4 m and 7 4 m since the soil profiles are all different for cbf 2 they are not discussed in this section fig 14 shows the soil deformation percentage at different locations for cbf 1 the horizontal displacements at the center are significantly influenced by the height of bucket wall the center displacement is larger when the bucket wall becomes higher because the bucket wall basically provides the entire horizontal resistance for cbf 1 and the longer wall means the larger contact area and larger resistance therefore soil inside the wall suffers more from the load transferred from the bucket wall the variations of the displacement percentage are basically the same from the wall to the outside 1 0d and further 2 0d except that the deformation percentage decreases obviously from the wall to the region of 1 0d where the stress dissipates quickly to the soil around as for the settlement a similar pattern can be observed the height of the wall has a clear impact on the soil inside compared with limited impacts seen beyond the region of 1 0d however the impact is opposite for the back and the wall at the backside soil motion is upward taking over half percentage of the maximum settlement and it increases as the growth of the wall the backside refers to the soil inside the bucket wall where the confined effect restricts the upward motion otherwise the percentage should be larger at the backside while inside the wall with longer bucket wall the resistance is bigger leading to a smaller settlement outside the wall soil is not confined and compressed thus the settlement is much larger than that of inside vertical to the load direction the settlements are less than 20 and slightly affected by the wall height generally the bucket wall height has a limited impact on soil outside of the wall the displacement inside the bucket wall increase as the wall height which is not the case for the settlement in fig 15 cbf 1 and cbf 2 are compared in terms of the load bearing ratio and the rotation for cbf 1 in most cases the differences of the load bearing ratio resulted from the wall height are small around 10 however for cbf 2 the difference is much larger around 20 as for the rotation the angle decreases as the increase of the height for both cbf 1 and cbf 2 except that cbf 2 shows much smaller rotation angles for both lid and wall given that the bucket wall dominates the load bearing mode for cbf 1 the results are reasonable 4 3 compartment plates based on the above analyses the compartment plates are proven to have important effects on the load bearing patterns and the deformation of structure and soil from the deformation analyses in section 3 it can be concluded that with compartment plates the displacements of the structure are more consistent and the rotation angles are much smaller under the same loading conditions this is also true for the deformations of soil the soil displacement inside bucket foundation varies apparently for cbf 1 but it becomes smaller for cbf 2 because of the existence of compartment plates it indicates that compartment plates improve the integrity of the bucket foundation and enhance the interaction between soil and structure by increasing the contact areas which further contributes to the horizontal and bending bearing capacity moreover it clearly changes the load bearing ratios between the bucket lid and the bucket wall under a certain soil condition however more precise conclusions on the load bearing capacity cannot be drawn based on the current research results due to the definition of the load bearing ratio besides more groups of soil conditions should be considered to clarify the contribution from the compartment plates especially for these with larger diameters 5 conclusion this study deals with a comparative study of the load bearing behaviors of a relatively new offshore wind turbine supporting structure the composite bucket foundation the finite element method is applied to account for the load bearing behaviors in terms of deformations and a proposed parameter load bearing ratios the transition piece is modeled to guarantee a more realistic load distribution state on the foundation the contribution from the compartment plates is illustrated by two models cbf 1 and cbf 2 combined loading conditions and layered soil profiles are also considered based on the reality condition the dimensional data of the cbfs studied in this paper are from the prototype offshore wind turbine models 3 mw 6 mw which have been installed in china the numerical models of cbf are first introduced with the layered soil conditions and the structure configurations deformations of structure and soil are then discussed separately the load bearing behaviors are drawn in terms of the load bearing ratio and further analyses regarding to the dimensional parameters are conducted the main conclusions are as follows the lateral displacement of cbf 1 is sensitive to the penetration depth since it contributes mostly for the horizontal bearing capacity the higher the wall is the less displacement and rotation it shows the maximum rotation occurs more likely at the top and the bottom of the bucket wall which can be reduced by increasing the height soil deformations are different inside the bucket wall displacement is minimum at the center and peaks at the wall while it is much smaller at the perpendicular direction the height of the bucket wall has an obvious impact on the deformation of inside soil basically the bucket wall dominants the load bearing mode for cbf 1 which is more apparent when the bucket wall is higher for cbf 2 the deformations are more conformed because the compartment plates improve the structure s integrity as well as the interaction between soil and structure the deformation is smaller and less sensitive to the compartment plates at the perpendicular direction and it can be reduced with larger bucket diameter except for soft soil condition the rotation at the tips of the wall is larger than that around the middle part suggesting a buckling risk which can be eliminated by adding stiffeners the deformations concentrate mainly at the region about 1 2 times of the bucket diameter also for cbf 1 with sand soil the lid bearing mode can be concluded for cbf 2 in mucky soil load bearing ratios of the bucket wall and the compartment plates increase significantly although there are multi factors involved in the load bearing mode of the cbf the present study aims to preset realistic characteristics of deformations for both structure and soil the results can provide further ideas to understand the load bearing mode and function as a basis for the future design optimization of the composite bucket foundation facilitating its wider acceptance and

suction bucket foundation is eco friendly simple in construction and installation besides it is widely adaptable to soil conditions and less in need of scour protection and seabed preparation randolph and house 2002 different from the traditional concept of suction bucket foundations a new type of wide shallow large scale composite bucket foundation cbf was proposed by tianjin university and daoda company see in fig 1 the 2 5 mw prototype of the cbf was used for the first offshore wind turbine prototype in the qidong sea area of jiangsu province of china in 2010 and now more larger size offshore wind turbines with this composite bucket foundation have been installed in sanxia offshore wind farm of jiangsu province of china in 2019 many research works have been done on suction bucket foundations exploring the challenges in costs and presenting simple design calculations houlsby and byrne 2000 byrne and houlsby 2006 fu et al 2015 the main issues for that are mono direction load bearing capacity barari and ibsen 2012 and cyclical lateral loadings induced dynamic responses zhang et al 2007 2010 the bearing performances involved with different soil properties were investigated by laboratory and field tests and reported in details and the critical failure mechanism was discussed with the yield envelope and the upper bound or lower bound analyses randolph and house 2002 houlsby et al 2005 yun and bransby 2007 fu et al 2020 numerical studies have been carried out on both the bucket foundation and the cbf for the application and verification of fem early in 1999 erbrich and tjelta had presented a series of finite element analyses by abaqus and compared that with extensive model tests on the installation of suction caissons in sand erbrich and tjelta 1999 both experimental and numerical results suggest the same degradation of the tip resistance tran and randolph 2008 also conducted model tests on the variation of suction pressure in dense sand and further compared that with finite element simulations they suggested that fe analyses appeared to explain this observation well and a consistent pattern of behavior was established for all the model and field data achmus et al 2013 validated the numerical model abaqus by carrying out back calculation of experimental field tests reported in literature the back calculations show that the finite element simulation is capable of realistically modelling the load bearing behavior of a bucket foundation in sand under monotonic horizontal loading experimental and finite element analyses were conducted by li et al 2015 on the bearing capacities of modified suction caissons mscs in sand under static horizontal loading which verified the numerical modelling by the back analysis of the moment rotation curves liu et al 2017 studied the lateral bearing capacity of bucket foundations by tests and fem the test and fem results were compared in terms of the earth pressure to analyze the failure mechanism of instability apart from that numerical studies specifically on cbf have been conducted and verified with model tests on the load bearing capacities ding et al 2015a 2015b liu et al 2018 jia et al 2018 they carried out model test in clay and silt soil to investigate the envelope curve of ultimate bearing capacity in different load space the main failure mode and the center of rotation of the structure that the strengthened silt by negative pressure inside the bucket can improve the bearing capacity has been concluded based on the test and numerical results it is also suggested that with proper elasticity modulus of the soils the load displacement relationships obtained using fem simulations are almost in same trend with the test results while the load bearing behaviors of the cbf due to the inside configuration has not been illustrated the features of the new load bearing mode induced by internal soil structure interaction needs to be accounted for on the other hand for the configuration of cbf the pre stressing arc transition piece design can effectively solve the stress transformation from the big moment at the top of the transition part to limited tensile compressive stress at the bottom lian et al 2012 it was further compared with the line type transition piece on the bearing mode and the force transfer paths by both theory and the finite element methods zhang et al 2016 he et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 a the results show the arc shape transition section exhibits a better mechanical characteristic and prove its significance in eliminating the force concentration thus the arc shape concrete transition piece shown in figs 2 and 3 is modeled in the numerical model in this paper with a reasonable subdivision compartments inside the one step installation technique of the cbf was proved to be economical and efficient ding et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 2015 and the compartment plates involved with seepage issues can influence the bearing capacity of the cbf zhang et al 2017 b 2018 hu et al 2018 which prompts the necessity for considering the compartment plates in this analysis moreover the loading bearing capacity for cbf has been studied with consideration of silt and sand soil conditions and a top cover bearing mode was concluded for muddy soil lian et al 2011 based on that the load bearing mode is focused in this study in this paper the load bearing behaviors of cbf with an arc transition piece were studied by the numerical method to clarify the impacts of the compartment plates two configurations are described see in figs 2 and 3 and analyzed namely cbf 1 cbf 2 two sets of dimensions of the cbf designed for 3 mw and 6 mw offshore wind turbines are adopted the height of cbf is shallow which makes the upper layer of soil very important for analyzing the bearing behaviors these models are not only various in embedded soil properties but also in combined environment loadings the results based on these coupled factors are more representative to observe the load bearing behavior the details of geometry and property parameters are introduced in section 2 in section 3 the load transferring mechanism and load bearing mode are investigated in terms of the deformations of cbf and soil the contact pressure between cbf and soil around is integrated to compare the load bearing ratio the effects of the dimensions and the configurations are analyzed in section 4 finally the main ideas are concluded in section 5 2 numerical models 2 1 structure soil interaction soil structure interaction can be considered by using equivalent linear spring models distributed nonlinear spring models continuum element models oh et al 2018 for homogeneous soil the soil strength is modeled as linear spring due to its small deformation which is effective for feasibility analysis as for the distributed nonlinear soil models the distributed springs represented by three load deflection curves have been presented in codes such as api dnv american petroleum institute 2005 det norske veritas 2011 continuum element models of soil have been proposed to account for soil structure interaction and several numerical models are available like mohr coulomb duncan chang plaxis harding soil et al ti et al 2009 mohr coulomb model a simple elastic perfectly plastic constitutive model is the most common model in the context of geomaterials and in particular soils pietruszczak 2010 it requires only about three or four parameters that can be readily derived from common soil laboratory tests to incorporate elastoplastic behavior through the use of a frictional yield surface toh et al 2019 the contact properties to simulate the interaction of bucket foundation with soil in abaqus include a normal direction effect and a tangential direction effect estimated by coulombs friction law there is no slip on the contact surface between foundation and soil when the shear stress is less than the ultimate value 2 2 finite element model finite element method is adopted in this paper and analyses were conducted using the abaqus software simulia 2010 the first order eight node brick element with reduced integration c3d8r was used to model the soil and the bucket foundation the mesh convergence analyses were performed at first to obtain the optimal number of elements around sixty thousand to eighty thousand for following analyses the numerical model includes a concrete transition piece and a steel bucket foundation the steel bucket foundation is modeled as one piece thus no contact property needs to be defined the contact property is defined as the tied contact for the transition piece and the steel bucket foundation the tied contact defined here indicates that nodes on the master and the slave surfaces have the same values of displacement given that the relative deformation on the interface is negligible therefore adopting the tied contact property here is reasonable 2 2 1 composite bucket foundation cbf 1 the cbf 1 is shown in fig 2 which includes an arc shape concrete transition piece and a shallow steel suction caisson the geometry parameters are listed in table 1 the listed dimensional parameters for this cbf 1 are designed for a 3 mw offshore wind turbine as shown in fig 2 the height of bucket wall is changed locating at different soil layers 2 2 2 composite bucket foundation cbf 2 the configuration of cbf 2 is demonstrated in fig 3 there are three main parts the concrete transition piece the steel bucket foundation the compartment plates these compartment plates divide the bucket into seven compartments which is beneficial for controlling and leveling the suction process and enhancing the bearing capacity the wind turbine is connected with the transition piece via flanges the height of transition piece is alterable based on the water depth in design sea area the information about the dimensional parameters of cbf 2 has been shown in table 2 overall the dimensions listed in tables 1 and 2 for cbf are determined by the power generating capacity of the supported wind turbines which are 3 mw and 6 mw in this paper the diameters of 30 m and 32 m are designed for 3 mw wind turbines while for 6 mw wind turbines cbfs are generally designed with a diameter no less than 35 m 2 2 3 soil model soil properties are complicated in offshore wind farm especially in china as a wide shallow structure the surface soil property can be important in dominant load bearing mode for cbf therefore layered soil conditions are concerned coupled with the dimensional effects of cbfs cbf 1 and cbf 2 the load bearing ratios and deformations are analyzed as for cbf 1 the soil condition is the same for different models as shown in table 3 and fig 2 while for cbf 2 four groups of soil profiles are chosen and combined with four groups of diameters see in table 4 and fig 4 2 3 combined loading fig 5 demonstrates the combined loading condition which includes the wind turbine loads m h v and equivalent wave loading the soil model was set up with a diameter five times as that of the bucket foundation to eliminate the boundary effect by finite element method the finite element mesh used in the present study is shown to provide a better view of inside features and the mesh fig 5 shows the whole structure with a half section the numerical simulations are carried out with the whole models displacements at the bottom boundary were fully fixed for six degrees of freedom while for the lateral boundary condition the vertical motion is allowed as well as the rotation along two horizontal axes this combined loading environment is typical and representative for offshore wind foundation structures to make the simulation results meaningful in understanding the load bearing behaviors of the cbf 3 deformation analyses the load bearing behavior is a classical problem in offshore engineering which can be investigated through the three dimensional deformations of structure and soil around based on soil structure interaction 3 1 deformation of cbf the structure deformations for cbf 1 and cbf 2 are analyzed from two perspectives horizontal displacement and rotation first the deformation of cbf 1 is compared the combined loadings are constant for four models with different wall height four positions on the bucket lid are chosen to show the overall deformations of cbf 1s as shown in fig 6 notice that the bending moment exerts the same effect as the horizontal load dose on the foundation that is in cartesian coordinate system the bending moment is in the positive direction of y axis if the horizontal load is in the positive direction of x axis the target positions are chosen based on that the deformations are obtained vertically at these points in fig 6 the penetration depth of cbf 1 is defined as vertical axis the variation of the deformations resulted from the height of bucket wall shows a clear distinction the maximum lateral displacement decreases significantly from 18 cm to 5 cm by around 70 as the increase of the penetration depth which increases by a relative lower percentage of 62 from 7 4 m to 12 m because the wall provides the most lateral resistance and bears the uplift load transferred from transition piece especially when the wall passes through the second layer to the third layer a soft layer where the cohesive stress is much larger then the deformation decreases the most the displacement at point 3 at the passive soil pressure region shows clear divergence near to the bottom of bucket wall this may because that soil inside the bucket wall is compacted more providing resistance force for bucket wall however when the wall penetrates through the layer this resistance is limited the structure rotation at these chosen positions shows similar patterns in lateral for point 2 and 4 they have the same rotation angle which drops down as the increase of bucket wall however along point 1 and 3 the rotation angles fluctuate around the rotation level of point 2 and 4 a slight difference is that the point 1 at the active region of soil pressure shows less variation than point 3 does in passive region of soil pressure this is because that the soil outside the bucket wall around point 1 withstands the horizontal deformation and provided more resistance than the inside soil moreover the back and forth rotation patterns shown by point 1 and 3 may indicated a local buckling issue which can be eliminated by adding assistant stiffeners generally the rotation along bucket wall changes more significantly at the bottom than at the top this indicates a suitable location for adding stiffener to enhance the structure stiffness and bearing capacity as for cbf 2 the features of displacement and rotation angle are quite different from that of cbf 1 five different diameters are compared and the deformation is analyzed in respect to twelve positions as shown in fig 7 points 1 6 at the intersection of compartment plates represent the deformation of the mid compartment while points 11 66 represent that of the bucket wall the depth of each soil layer is indicated by the dash line as shown in fig 7 from fig 7 the horizontal displacement at twelve points is more consistent with larger diameters the maximum displacement will reduce however this is not the case in soil with lower strength as shown in fig 7 d and e where the diameter is larger and the deformation is also larger with compartment plates inside the bucket and soil interactions are intensified and the strength of the surface soil should be more concerned a slight growth of displacement can be observed due to the growth in diameter even the soil profile is the same this is unexpected as the larger diameter has a stronger soil resistance and then smaller displacement given limited model samples here the reason is unable to be explained besides the horizontal displacement at the bottom of bucket wall shows a much smaller variation because the compartment plates bear a portion of loads the rotations of compartment plates and bucket wall vary obviously the largest rotation occurs with the smallest diameter which also shows the most significant fluctuation considering smaller soil resistance for the smallest diameter this deformation is reasonable when the same loads are applied the points 1 6 seem to have larger rotation angle than that of points 11 66 bucket wall and the fluctuations are slightly intenser for most diameters it indicates the deformation is larger inside the bucket foundation because the overall deformation is partly shouldered by these thinner compartment plates the rotation fluctuates less at the lower height even the rotation at the top and bottom is bigger than that around the middle height the back and forth rotation patterns for both the wall and the compartment plates may indicate a buckling issue the variation of rotation angle in sand around 0 5 rad is larger than that in muddy and clay soil around 0 3 rad which can be account for by the cohesive stress 3 2 deformation of soil the soil settlement and horizontal displacement under combined loadings are analyzed in this section the settlement and displacement were compared for different layers at the direction of the horizontal load x axis referred as solid lines in fig 8 these dash lines refer to deformations in y axis the term location in fig 8 indicates the distance to the soil center and the legend shows the depth of each line measured from the soil surface in meters again the coordinate system is a cartesian coordinate system in which z axis is positive upward from fig 8 the soil deformations of cbf 1 are quite brief the displacement of surface layers inside the bucket wall is positive and increased from the very center of the soil model to the bucket wall however in deep layers soil motions are different regardless of the outside deformation the lateral displacement is minimum at the center and maximum at the wall this is because the motion of the soil inside the bucket wall is confined and compressed more especially at the center where the deformation is limited there is a distinct drop of the deformations at the bucket wall from inside to outside which also suggests that movement of soil inside the bucket wall is controlled by the structure deformation at the direction of y axis the deformation of soil is much smaller as well as the differences between the center and the side this is because the deformation follows the load direction and has less impacts on the normal direction y axis inside soil is compressed resulting in a consistent rotation motion which turning forward at the surface and backward at the bottom as for the soil settlement concise features can be concluded from the inside and outside perspectives the soil settlement at the center is negative and it varies linearly to the wall in positive axis soil motion is downwards and larger than that in the other side where soil motion is upwards which proves the rotation trend due to the bending moment a significant change can be seen at the wall from the inside to the outside soil settlement drops rapidly outside to a placid level since the soil pressure transferred and dissipates to a wider rage inside the bucket wall the settlement curves at y axis are negative and close to each other in general soil deformation shows an obvious sensitive region about 1 2 times of the diameter as the bucket foundation the deformation is quite limited beyond this region moreover deformations in the y axis are much lower than that in the x axis it indicates that soil reinforcement measure can be more effective inside the bucket wall and soil protections conducted in the certain region should be sufficient the soil deformation for cbf 2 exhibits a clear distinction compared with that for cbf 1 due to the compartment plates as shown in fig 9 the lateral displacement of soil inside the bucket wall is positive and increased a little from the very center to the wall regardless of the outside deformation the lateral displacement shows a diminishing variation from the center and to the wall as diameter growth besides there is also a distinct drop at the bucket wall from inside to outside this suggests that the motion of soil inside the bucket wall is more agreed with the structure deformation because of the compartmet plates that is the compartment plates increase the inside interaction between soil and structure thus the resistance is improved as for the soil settlement it is negative at the center and it varies linearly to the wall in x axis in positive axis soil motion is downwards and larger than the other side where soil motion is upwards a significant change can be seen from the inside to the outside of the wall where soil settlement decreases rapidly to a placid level the reason is the same as mentioned before the settlement curves at y axis are negative and the difference is more clear and larger between the center compartment and side ones this indicates that the soil inside is motivated by these compartment plates and it is more obvious with larger diameters since deformations in mid compartment are much larger in general soil deformations of cbf are obviously influenced by compartment plates the deformation inside the wall is more agreed and it is reduced rapidly to a limited amount beyond a certain region around 1 2 d outside moreover displacements in the y axis are comparatively closer to that in the x axis 3 3 load bearing behaviors the large horizontal force and bending moment transferred from the arc shape transaction piece to the bucket lid and further to bucket wall and compartment plates these compartments can enhance the bearing capacity of bucket foundations however the contributions to the overall load bearing capacity from each component bucket lid bucket wall and compartment plates are not clear yet since it is hard to be obtained from experiment results the dominant bearing mode is quantified by a proposed parameter load bearing ratio it is the weight of the stress integral contact pressure on each component note that in the active region of soil pressure the outside surface of the bucket wall may play a major role but in the passive region inside surface supported by the compressed soil is more important besides they mainly contribute in horizontal direction the bucket lid takes a major place in the vertical direction the stress integral of each part is found in their dominant directions even though the bearing capacity of each part dominants in different direction the combined effects should be the same when the same eternal loads are applied then the contribution from each part can be calculated and compared by their weights load bearing ratio e for instance the weight of bucket lid is found as 1 e 1 σ 1 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 100 where σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 are the stress integral of bucket lid wall and plates respectively under the combined loading state the stress integral is obtained by integrating the contact pressure on the surface of each component figs 10 and 11 demonstrate the load bearing ratios of each part for cbf 2 and cbf 1 respectively fig 10 compares the load bearing ratios of the bucket lid bucket wall and compartment plates for cbf 2 with different diameters in fig 10 a d the surface soil is sand and the bucket lid plays a major role since its load bearing ratio is over 60 the bucket wall takes the second place with a weight around 25 the compartment plates take the least proportion especially when the bucket wall height is short suggested by fig 10 d this is reasonable because the cohesive stress is small for sand and the area of interface providing the lateral resistance is shorten in this case as a result the bearing ratio decreases as for fig 10 e g it changes significantly that the bucket lid plays a descending role and finally the load bearing ratio becomes less than 20 however the bucket wall and the compartment plates are increased to an equal value around 40 this can be accounted for by the variation of soil property of surface layers as shown in table 1 the surface layer of soil is sand for diameter of 30 m 32 m and 35 m ① ② while for the rest it is the muddy and clay soil with lower strength considering the cohesive stress is larger for clay therefore the interaction is enhanced and the deformation of this layer is small which makes the bucket wall and compartment plates more mobilized as shown in fig 11 for cbf 1 with the same diameter and the same soil condition load bearing ratios are much clear since only two parts are involved generally the bucket wall plays a larger role than the bucket lid regardless of the wall heights the load bearing ratios of bucket wall and the lid are quite close especially when the wall is shorter in order to clarify the impact of the soil property the first layer of soil for cbf 1 with a wall height of 7 4 m is changed into the muddy silt clay the same parameter as that in cbf 2 with diameter of 37 m the load bearing ratios for the bucket wall and bucket lid are 54 94 and 45 05 respectively it is close to that shown in fig 11 d wall 55 22 lid 44 78 it suggests that the load bearing capacity of cbf 1 is less sensitive to the surface soil property compared with cbf 2 the differences in the contribution weight of each component are complicated because the definition of this weight load bearing ratio has a drawback that is only the dominant direction is considered to find the stress integral however for example the wall and plates can also bear the vertical load which is neglect in this analysis moreover the compartment plates change the interaction between structure and soil and it increases the integrity of the wall and the lid therefore the dominant load bearing mode is different for cbf 1 and cbf 2 in general it is reasonable to conclude that the compartment plates can change the load bearing mode from the wall dominant cbf 1 to the bucket lid dominate cbf 2 except for the silt clay soil condition 4 parametric study 4 1 diameter of cbf in section 3 the deformations and load bearing ratio of bucket foundations cbf 1 and cbf 2 are analyzed but the relations with dimensional features are not illustrated therefore in this section the load bearing behaviors varying with diameters are studied as shown in figs 12 14 fig 12 shows the soil deformation percentage at different locations the deformation percentage is defined as the real deformation at each location over the maximum deformation of soil these locations demonstrated in fig 12 are named as center plate wall 1 0d and 2 0d respectively the name vertical in fig 12 b means the point is at the direction vertical to the horizontal load in addition the load direction applied in these models is different in fig 12 a the percentage of displacement decreases significantly from the bucket wall 90 to the distance of 1 0d 16 and finally it becomes limited beyond the region of 2 0d this indicates that in soil the load dissipates rapidly to a wider range outside the wall any soil protection and strengthen strategies would be more effective within this range it is noticeable that when the diameter is larger the maximum displacement shows at the plate instead of the bucket wall as suggested by models with smaller diameters this is probably because that the soft property of surface soil transfers larger proportion of loadings to the wall and compartment plates another reason may relate to the load direction fig 12 a since the compartment plates are in the vertical position to the direction of the loads which makes it contribute more the larger diameter it is the greater reduction and the smaller percentage of displacement are shown in the region between 1 0d and 2 0d the soil settlement referred here dose not indicate the direction of movement and it is the absolute value therefore the values are positive as fig 12 b shown the outside settlement is limited beyond a round region of 1 0d less than 10 the maximum settlement occurs at the compartment plate for large dimeter d 36 m and 37 m while for other smaller diameters it shows at the bucket wall it is related to the soft soil property which has a larger interface with the compartment plates and bigger cohesive stress leading to a higher load bearing ratio and a larger settlement the soil settlements are less than 30 for diameter within 35 m at center and vertical locations however it is much larger around 55 for the rest two diameters of cbf 2 this suggests that with smaller diameters the soil inside the bucket wall are more compressed and constrained leading to comparatively smaller deformations in fig 13 the load bearing ratio and the bucket rotation are compared considering the impact of diameters it is clear that larger diameters lead to a relative higher proportion of load distribution and the rotation on the lid the load bearing ratio of the bucket wall basically takes the second place around 30 for smaller diameters and 40 for larger diameters the compartment plates contribute the least when the diameter is small the diameter of 35 m seems to be a turning point for the dominant bearing mode in that the last three curves with identical soil profiles show opposite features for load bearing ratios because the height of the bucket wall is also different in these cases the single factor analysis may not be quite clear as anticipated as for the structure rotation differences are very small among the three components however the impacts from the change of diameter are significant the large diameter enhances the vertical bearing capacity by increasing the interface area and leads to a smaller rotation angle but if the surface soil is silt clay then cbf 2 shows the largest rotation with the largest diameter as explained in that case the bucket wall and compartment plates play larger roles in load bearing accounting for bigger deformations 4 2 height of bucket wall for cbf 2 three groups of wall height are considered 10 m d 30 m 35 m ① ③ 36 m 37 m 12 m d 32 m 7 5 m d 35m ② for cbf 1 four groups of wall height are considered 12 m 9 4 m 8 4 m and 7 4 m since the soil profiles are all different for cbf 2 they are not discussed in this section fig 14 shows the soil deformation percentage at different locations for cbf 1 the horizontal displacements at the center are significantly influenced by the height of bucket wall the center displacement is larger when the bucket wall becomes higher because the bucket wall basically provides the entire horizontal resistance for cbf 1 and the longer wall means the larger contact area and larger resistance therefore soil inside the wall suffers more from the load transferred from the bucket wall the variations of the displacement percentage are basically the same from the wall to the outside 1 0d and further 2 0d except that the deformation percentage decreases obviously from the wall to the region of 1 0d where the stress dissipates quickly to the soil around as for the settlement a similar pattern can be observed the height of the wall has a clear impact on the soil inside compared with limited impacts seen beyond the region of 1 0d however the impact is opposite for the back and the wall at the backside soil motion is upward taking over half percentage of the maximum settlement and it increases as the growth of the wall the backside refers to the soil inside the bucket wall where the confined effect restricts the upward motion otherwise the percentage should be larger at the backside while inside the wall with longer bucket wall the resistance is bigger leading to a smaller settlement outside the wall soil is not confined and compressed thus the settlement is much larger than that of inside vertical to the load direction the settlements are less than 20 and slightly affected by the wall height generally the bucket wall height has a limited impact on soil outside of the wall the displacement inside the bucket wall increase as the wall height which is not the case for the settlement in fig 15 cbf 1 and cbf 2 are compared in terms of the load bearing ratio and the rotation for cbf 1 in most cases the differences of the load bearing ratio resulted from the wall height are small around 10 however for cbf 2 the difference is much larger around 20 as for the rotation the angle decreases as the increase of the height for both cbf 1 and cbf 2 except that cbf 2 shows much smaller rotation angles for both lid and wall given that the bucket wall dominates the load bearing mode for cbf 1 the results are reasonable 4 3 compartment plates based on the above analyses the compartment plates are proven to have important effects on the load bearing patterns and the deformation of structure and soil from the deformation analyses in section 3 it can be concluded that with compartment plates the displacements of the structure are more consistent and the rotation angles are much smaller under the same loading conditions this is also true for the deformations of soil the soil displacement inside bucket foundation varies apparently for cbf 1 but it becomes smaller for cbf 2 because of the existence of compartment plates it indicates that compartment plates improve the integrity of the bucket foundation and enhance the interaction between soil and structure by increasing the contact areas which further contributes to the horizontal and bending bearing capacity moreover it clearly changes the load bearing ratios between the bucket lid and the bucket wall under a certain soil condition however more precise conclusions on the load bearing capacity cannot be drawn based on the current research results due to the definition of the load bearing ratio besides more groups of soil conditions should be considered to clarify the contribution from the compartment plates especially for these with larger diameters 5 conclusion this study deals with a comparative study of the load bearing behaviors of a relatively new offshore wind turbine supporting structure the composite bucket foundation the finite element method is applied to account for the load bearing behaviors in terms of deformations and a proposed parameter load bearing ratios the transition piece is modeled to guarantee a more realistic load distribution state on the foundation the contribution from the compartment plates is illustrated by two models cbf 1 and cbf 2 combined loading conditions and layered soil profiles are also considered based on the reality condition the dimensional data of the cbfs studied in this paper are from the prototype offshore wind turbine models 3 mw 6 mw which have been installed in china the numerical models of cbf are first introduced with the layered soil conditions and the structure configurations deformations of structure and soil are then discussed separately the load bearing behaviors are drawn in terms of the load bearing ratio and further analyses regarding to the dimensional parameters are conducted the main conclusions are as follows the lateral displacement of cbf 1 is sensitive to the penetration depth since it contributes mostly for the horizontal bearing capacity the higher the wall is the less displacement and rotation it shows the maximum rotation occurs more likely at the top and the bottom of the bucket wall which can be reduced by increasing the height soil deformations are different inside the bucket wall displacement is minimum at the center and peaks at the wall while it is much smaller at the perpendicular direction the height of the bucket wall has an obvious impact on the deformation of inside soil basically the bucket wall dominants the load bearing mode for cbf 1 which is more apparent when the bucket wall is higher for cbf 2 the deformations are more conformed because the compartment plates improve the structure s integrity as well as the interaction between soil and structure the deformation is smaller and less sensitive to the compartment plates at the perpendicular direction and it can be reduced with larger bucket diameter except for soft soil condition the rotation at the tips of the wall is larger than that around the middle part suggesting a buckling risk which can be eliminated by adding stiffeners the deformations concentrate mainly at the region about 1 2 times of the bucket diameter also for cbf 1 with sand soil the lid bearing mode can be concluded for cbf 2 in mucky soil load bearing ratios of the bucket wall and the compartment plates increase significantly although there are multi factors involved in the load bearing mode of the cbf the present study aims to preset realistic characteristics of deformations for both structure and soil the results can provide further ideas to understand the load bearing mode and function as a basis for the future design optimization of the composite bucket foundation facilitating its wider acceptance and

equations of the coupled system are generally difficult to solve analytically to simplify the analysis it is usually assumed that the column is prismatic in full contact with water and the effects of water compressibility and gravity surface waves are negligible liaw and chopra 1974 investigated the influence of water compressibility and gravity surface waves on the earthquake response of cantilever towers and concluded that the effects of water compressibility on squat towers and gravity surface waves on slender towers cannot be ignored the free flexural vibration of prismatic columns surrounded by water has been investigated by several researchers zhou 1993 studied the vibrational behavior of a column with arbitrarily shaped cross section in full contact with water the euler bernoulli beam theory was used the water compressibility and gravity surface waves were considered in the analysis the results were numerically given by means of a computer han and xu 1996 presented a theoretical model for the added mass representation of a circular column in full contact with water the euler bernoulli beam theory was used the water compressibility and gravity surface waves were neglected excellent agreement with the natural frequencies computed from the analytical model was observed zhao et al 2002 investigated the dynamic behavior of a beam water coupled system with a concentrated mass attached at the free end of the beam the euler bernoulli beam theory was employed the water compressibility was considered in the analysis but gravity surface waves were ignored it was shown that the frequency of the coupled system decreases as the concentrated mass increases and that the concentrated mass and the moment of inertia have small effect on the modes zhou and liu 2007 presented a theoretical model to investigate the flexural torsional vibration characteristics of a column with an arbitrary cross section in partial contact with water the euler bernoulli beam theory coupled with torsion was used the water compressibility and gravity surface waves were considered in the analysis numerical results were presented for elliptical columns in partial contact with water eftekhari and jafari 2014 proposed a mixed modal differential quadrature formulation to study the dynamic behavior of beams in contact with a fluid the euler bernoulli beam theory was utilized the water compressibility and gravity surface waves were incorporated in the analysis the formulation of the problem was expressed in matrix form which made programming very easy the efficiency and accuracy of the method were demonstrated by comparing the calculated results with those obtained by analytical and numerical solutions bouaanani and miquel 2015 proposed a simplified method to determine the modal dynamic and earthquake response of coupled flexible beam fluid systems and to evaluate their natural frequencies the benoulli euler beam theory was used the fluid was assumed incompressible inviscid and irrotational gravity surface waves and non convective effects were neglected it was shown that the proposed technique gives an excellent assessment of the earthquake and frequency responses of coupled beam fluid systems the numerical results confirmed the importance of accounting for fluid structure interaction effects which may reduce by more than twice the fundamental vibration frequency of the dry beam and amplify its response quantities jafari talookolaei and lasemi imani 2015 considered a delaminated offshore structure having the form of a laminated composite beam in partial contact with a fluid and presented its free vibration characteristics the delaminated beam was modeled as a uniform bernoulli euler cantilever beam the pressure distribution function of the fluid was obtained by solving the wave equation parametric studies have shown that the frequencies and mode shapes of a delaminated composite beam are significantly influenced by the size and location of the delamination eftekhari 2016 presented the pressure based mixed ritz differential quadrature method and the potential based mixed ritz differential quadrature method to study the free and forced vibration of timoshenko beams in contact with a fluid the proposed mixed methods use the ritz method and the differential quadrature method to discretize the governing partial differential equation of motion of the beam and the fluid respectively the effects of various parameters on the vibration behavior of the fluid loaded timoshenko beam such as the mass ratio thickness ratio speed of sound fluid compressibility and fluid boundary conditions were also studied all these parameters were shown to have significant effects on the dynamic behavior of the system jiang et al 2017 proposed a simplified formula for the hydrodynamic pressure on deepwater cylindrical bridge piers during earthquakes to elaborate data fitting in which the section radius of the pier and water height are the main parameters the accuracy of the proposed formula was validated by the radiation wave theory and the potential based fluid element method the proposed simplified formula resulted in substantial improvement in computational efficiency without introducing any significant reduction in quality compared with the more complex radiation wave theory and potential based fluid methods the formulations in the above quoted references are all based on approximate one dimensional beam theories the application of such theories to short thick columns or to problems involving high frequencies of vibration is inadequate the three dimensional elasticity theory is needed the governing equations of free vibration of non uniform column water interaction systems are difficult to solve analytically and recourse must be made to numerical methods such as the hierarchical finite element method coupled with the coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element method two types of hierarchical infinite elements exist in the literature displacement descent and coordinate ascent koh and lee 1998 presented a displacement descent hierarchical infinite element to represent 1 r n type decay problems in unbounded domains the shape functions along the infinite direction were constructed from the laguerre orthogonal polynomials the element has the disadvantage that the gauss legendre abscissas and weights are modified to account for the unbounded range houmat 2008 presented a coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element for two dimensional problems of unbounded domains the global semi infinite domain is mapped onto a local finite one the element has the advantage that the mapping is simple and the conventional gauss legendre abscissas and weights are retained the shape functions along the infinite direction were constructed from the shifted legendre orthogonal polynomials the element is not fully hierarchical in the sense that the shape functions are hierarchical along the infinite direction only houmat 2013 presented a coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element for a non homogeneous cross anisotropic half space subjected to a non uniform circular loading the element is fully hierarchical in this paper the free flexural vibration of non uniform water column interaction systems is investigated for the first time based on the three dimensional elasticity theory coupled with the wave equation which is solved by using the coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element method small amplitude free vibrations are assumed the three dimensional elasticity theory is suitable for short thick columns and problems involving high frequencies of vibration the non uniform water domain is modeled accurately by using the coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element method the non uniform flexible circular column is modeled accurately by using the hierarchical finite element method the analysis considers the combined effects of water compressibility and gravity surface waves the example of a tapered cantilever circular column is used to illustrate the method examples of stepped and parabolic cantilever circular columns are also considered to validate the method convergence and comparison studies are conducted for the cycle frequencies modal deflections and modal hydrodynamic pressures of a prismatic cantilever circular column in full contact with water new results for the cycle frequencies of tapered single stepped and parabolic cantilever circular columns in contact with water are presented the effect of the taper ratio on the cycle frequencies modal deflections modal bending stresses and modal hydrodynamic pressures is examined and discussed 2 formulation consider a tapered cantilever circular column

mass matrices k e and m e are 47 k e i 1 q 1 2 j 1 q 1 2 k i j e 48 m e i 1 q 1 2 j 1 q 1 2 m i j e the block element stiffness and mass matrices k i j e and m i j e are given in appendix a 4 governing equations of the coupled system considering the pressure gradient in the normal direction to the face n we have 49 p n ρ n t 2 u t 2 o n γ 1 where n n r 0 n z t the equations of free motion of the coupled system may be written as zienkiewicz et al 2005 50 m 0 q t s d 2 u d t 2 d 2 p d t 2 k q 0 h u p 0 0 the matrix h is 51 h ω w l t l d ω the matrix s is 52 h ω w l t 1 c 2 l d ω γ 3 l t

standard eigenvalue computation methods are applicable after assembling elements and applying essential boundary conditions the generalized eigenvalue problem of eq 55 is solved for the natural frequencies and the generalized displacements of the column together with the natural frequencies and the generalized hydrodynamic pressures however the natural frequencies and the generalized hydrodynamic pressures remain constant for different values of the density of the column the natural frequencies of the hydrodynamic pressure are associated with acoustic and sloshing modes the modal displacements of the column are obtained by using eq 27 the modal strains and modal stresses of the column are obtained by using eq 34 and eq 6 respectively the hydrodynamic pressure is obtained by using eq 7 5 numerical results and discussion by using the formulation described in the previous sections the natural frequencies modal deflections modal bending stresses and modal hydrodynamic pressures for the free flexural vibration of water column interaction systems are determined in the calculations it is assumed that the density of the column is 2450 kg m 3 and the density of water is 1000 kg m 3 the elasticity modulus of the column is 2 94 10 10 n m 2 the speed of sound in water is 1531 m s and the acceleration of gravity is 9 81 m s 2 numerical results are presented for the cycle frequencies normalized modal deflections normalized bending stresses and normalized hydrodynamic pressures of the lowest three flexural modes 5 1 validation study to validate the numerical method described in the previous sections convergence and comparison studies are performed a convergence study of the cycle frequencies as a function of q is performed for two tapered circular columns surrounded by water the first column is in full contact with water h w h whereas the second column is in partial contact with water h w 0 5 h the geometrical properties of the tapered circular column are a 2 m b 1 m and h 20 m the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are calculated by increasing q from 3 to 10 with a 1 increment the results of the column in full contact with water and the column in partial contact with water are plotted in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively it can be seen from the figures that the cycle frequencies converge rapidly downwards as q is increased for problems with quasi uniform meshes the asymptotic rate of convergence of the hierarchical finite element method in energy norm has been shown to be at least twice that of the finite element method babuška et al 1981 for a fixed q the number of degrees of freedom used for the column in partial contact with water is larger than that of the column in full contact with water which leads to a relatively faster convergence for instance for q 10 the numbers of degrees of freedom for the column in full contact with water and the column in partial contact of water are obtained as 430 and 750 respectively convergence up to two significant figures is obtained using q 10 the converged cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes of the column in full contact with water are calculated as 5 33 hz 21 57 hz and 49 99 hz the converged cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes of the column in partial contact with water are calculated as 6 22 hz 23 21 hz and 52 81 hz the converged cycle frequencies of the column in full contact with water are lower than those of the column in partial contact with water this is because the added mass effect on the column in full contact with water is higher than that on the column in partial contact with water in subsequent calculations q is taken as 10 unless otherwise stated a comparison study is now performed for the cycle frequencies of a prismatic cantilever circular column in full contact with water h w h and in partial contact with water h w 0 8 h the height of the column is 20 m the slenderness ratio is 0 01 the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are calculated by increasing q from 3 to 10 with a 1 increment the results are shown in table 1 along with the values obtained analytically by zhou and liu 2007 by using the euler bernoulli beam theory coupled with torsion it can be seen from the table that the cycle frequencies converge rapidly downwards as q is increased and the converged values are accurate up to two significant figures because the column is slender the converged cycle frequencies are in excellent agreement with those from zhou and liu 2007 comparison studies are also performed for modal deflections and modal hydrodynamic pressures of a prismatic cantilever circular column in full contact with water the height and the radius of the column are 20 m and 0 5 m respectively the normalized modal deflections u ξ 0 θ 0 ζ and normalized hydrodynamic pressures p α 0 θ 0 β for the lowest three flexural modes are plotted in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively comparisons are made with analytical solutions obtained by han and xu 1996 the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are 1 03 6 41 and 17 82 it can be seen from the figures that the shapes of the curves predicted by the two methods are similar the differences in modal deflections observed in fig 6 are due to the bernoulli euler beam theory which is used in han and xu 1996 to model the column the differences in hydrodynamic pressures observed in fig 7 are due to water compressibility gravity surface waves and acceleration of the column outer surface in han and xu 1996 the water compressibility and gravity surface waves are neglected and the acceleration of the column outer surface is based on the euler bernoulli beam theory a comparison between the cycle frequencies predicted by the three dimensional elasticity theory and the euler bernoulli beam theory is finally performed for this purpose we consider a prismatic cantilever circular column in full contact with water h w h the height of the column is 20 m the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are calculated by varying the slenderness ratio from 0 003 to 0 05 with a variable increment the results are plotted in fig 8 along with those obtained analytically by han and xu 1996 by using the euler bernoulli beam theory it can be seen from the figure that the cycle frequencies predicted by the euler bernoulli beam theory deviate from the three dimensional solutions as the slenderness ratio or the mode number is increased this is because the euler bernoulli beam theory neglects the effects of transverse shear deformations 5 2 parametric study a parametric study is initially conducted on a tapered cantilever circular column in contact with water the selected varying non dimensional parameters are the slenderness and taper ratios the column height is taken as 20 m the slenderness ratio a h is increased from 0 02 to 0 1 with a 0 02 increment the taper ratio b a is increased from 0 2 to 1 0 with a 0 2 increment the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes of the column in full contact with water and the column in partial contact with water are presented in table 2 and table 3 respectively when the column vibrates the water accelerates producing an additional force equal to the product of the displaced mass of water and the acceleration of the column this mass of water is called added mass it can be seen from the tables that the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes increase with increasing slenderness ratio as expected the cycle frequencies for the fundamental mode decrease with increasing taper ratio this is because the radial component of the acceleration vector of water in the fundamental mode does not change direction along the height of the column and increases with increasing taper ratio which leads to an increase in the added mass effect the cycle frequencies for the second and third modes increase with increasing taper ratio this is because the acceleration vectors of water in the second and third modes change direction along the column height which leads to a decrease in the added mass effect the maximum fundamental cycle frequency is not produced by the prismatic column the cycle frequencies of the column in full contact with water are higher than those of the column in partial contact with water this is because the added mass effect on the column in full contact with water is higher than that on the column in partial contact with water the normalized modal deflections u ξ 0 θ 0 ζ the normalized modal bending stresses σ z z ξ θ 0 ζ 0 and the normalized hydrodynamic pressures p α 0 θ 0 β for the lowest three flexural modes of a tapered circular column in full contact with water h h w 20 m are presented in fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 respectively we know that ε θ θ ε r r at r 0 to compute the modal bending stress σ z z at r 0 we replace ε θ θ by ε r r to circumvent the indeterminate form of ε θ θ the slenderness ratio is taken as 0 1 the taper ratio is increased from 0 2 to 1 0 with a 0 4 increment it can be seen from fig 9 that changes in the taper ratio lead to significant changes in the column curvature in the vicinity of the clamped edge which means that the modal bending stress σ z z changes significantly in the vicinity of the clamped edge as the taper ratio is changed this is confirmed by fig 10 which shows significant changes in the modal bending stress σ z z at the clamped edge as the taper ratio is changed it can also be seen from fig 11 that changes in the taper ratio lead to changes in the hydrodynamic pressure as expected the changes increase with increasing mode number this is due to the added mass which changes as the mode number or the taper ratio is changed the proposed numerical method can be applied to columns with stepped and curvilinear radius variations fig 12 shows a single stepped cantilever circular column in full contact with water the radius a radius b and height h are 0 2 m 0 1 m and 10 m respectively the column is modeled by three hierarchical finite elements the water domain is modeled by one hierarchical finite element and two coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite elements the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are calculated by increasing q from 3 to 10 with a 1 increment the results are presented in table 4 fig 13 shows a parabolic cantilever circular column in full contact with water the radius a radius b and height h are 0 2 m 0 2 m and 10 m respectively the column is modeled by ten hierarchical finite elements the water domain is modeled by ten coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite elements the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are computed by increasing q from 3 to 8 with a 1 increment the results are presented in table 5 the tables show a fast convergence downwards as q is increased 6 conclusion this paper presents a simple and highly accurate numerical method to compute the natural frequencies modal displacements modal stresses and modal hydrodynamic pressures for the free flexural vibration of water column interaction systems small amplitude free vibrations are assumed a hierarchical finite element based on the three dimensional elasticity theory is used to model the flexible circular column and a coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element based on the linear wave equation is used to model the water domain the effects of water compressibility and gravity surface waves are considered simultaneously in the

method is validated through convergence study and comparison with analytical results based on the euler bernoulli beam theory for the cycle frequencies modal deflections and modal hydrodynamic pressures of a prismatic cantilever circular column in full contact with water the cycle frequencies predicted by the euler bernoulli beam theory show deviation from the three dimensional solutions as the slenderness ratio or the mode number is increased new results for the cycle frequencies of tapered single stepped and parabolic cantilever circular columns surrounded by water are presented which may serve as a basis of comparison for other methods the cycle frequencies modal deflections modal bending stresses and modal hydrodynamic pressures are shown to be notably affected by the taper ratio

theoretical model for the added mass representation of a circular column in full contact with water the euler bernoulli beam theory was used the water compressibility and gravity surface waves were neglected excellent agreement with the natural frequencies computed from the analytical model was observed zhao et al 2002 investigated the dynamic behavior of a beam water coupled system with a concentrated mass attached at the free end of the beam the euler bernoulli beam theory was employed the water compressibility was considered in the analysis but gravity surface waves were ignored it was shown that the frequency of the coupled system decreases as the concentrated mass increases and that the concentrated mass and the moment of inertia have small effect on the modes zhou and liu 2007 presented a theoretical model to investigate the flexural torsional vibration characteristics of a column with an arbitrary cross section in partial contact with water the euler bernoulli beam theory coupled with torsion was used the water compressibility and gravity surface waves were considered in the analysis numerical results were presented for elliptical columns in partial contact with water eftekhari and jafari 2014 proposed a mixed modal differential quadrature formulation to study the dynamic behavior of beams in contact with a fluid the euler bernoulli beam theory was utilized the water compressibility and gravity surface waves were incorporated in the analysis the formulation of the problem was expressed in matrix form which made programming very easy the efficiency and accuracy of the method were demonstrated by comparing the calculated results with those obtained by analytical and numerical solutions bouaanani and miquel 2015 proposed a simplified method to determine the modal dynamic and earthquake response of coupled flexible beam fluid systems and to evaluate their natural frequencies the benoulli euler beam theory was used the fluid was assumed incompressible inviscid and irrotational gravity surface waves and non convective effects were neglected it was shown that the proposed technique gives an excellent assessment of the earthquake and frequency responses of coupled beam fluid systems the numerical results confirmed the importance of accounting for fluid structure interaction effects which may reduce by more than twice the fundamental vibration frequency of the dry beam and amplify its response quantities jafari talookolaei and lasemi imani 2015 considered a delaminated offshore structure having the form of a laminated composite beam in partial contact with a fluid and presented its free vibration characteristics the delaminated beam was modeled as a uniform bernoulli euler cantilever beam the pressure distribution function of the fluid was obtained by solving the wave equation parametric studies have shown that the frequencies and mode shapes of a delaminated composite beam are significantly influenced by the size and location of the delamination eftekhari 2016 presented the pressure based mixed ritz differential quadrature method and the potential based mixed ritz differential quadrature method to study the free and forced vibration of timoshenko beams in contact with a fluid the proposed mixed methods use the ritz method and the differential quadrature method to discretize the governing partial differential equation of motion of the beam and the fluid respectively the effects of various parameters on the vibration behavior of the fluid loaded timoshenko beam such as the mass ratio thickness ratio speed of sound fluid compressibility and fluid boundary conditions were also studied all these parameters were shown to have significant effects on the dynamic behavior of the system jiang et al 2017 proposed a simplified formula for the hydrodynamic pressure on deepwater cylindrical bridge piers during earthquakes to elaborate data fitting in which the section radius of the pier and water height are the main parameters the accuracy of the proposed formula was validated by the radiation wave theory and the potential based fluid element method the proposed simplified formula resulted in substantial improvement in computational efficiency without introducing any significant reduction in quality compared with the more complex radiation wave theory and potential based fluid methods the formulations in the above quoted references are all based on approximate one dimensional beam theories the application of such theories to short thick columns or to problems involving high frequencies of vibration is inadequate the three dimensional elasticity theory is needed the governing equations of free vibration of non uniform column water interaction systems are difficult to solve analytically and recourse must be made to numerical methods such as the hierarchical finite element method coupled with the coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element method two types of hierarchical infinite elements exist in the literature displacement descent and coordinate ascent koh and lee 1998 presented a displacement descent hierarchical infinite element to represent 1 r n type decay problems in unbounded domains the shape functions along the infinite direction were constructed from the laguerre orthogonal polynomials the element has the disadvantage that the gauss legendre abscissas and weights are modified to account for the unbounded range houmat 2008 presented a coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element for two dimensional problems of unbounded domains the global semi infinite domain is mapped onto a local finite one the element has the advantage that the mapping is simple and the conventional gauss legendre abscissas and weights are retained the shape functions along the infinite direction were constructed from the shifted legendre orthogonal polynomials the element is not fully hierarchical in the sense that the shape functions are hierarchical along the infinite direction only houmat 2013 presented a coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element for a non homogeneous cross anisotropic half space subjected to a non uniform circular loading the element is fully hierarchical in this paper the free flexural vibration of non uniform water column interaction systems is investigated for the first time based on the three dimensional elasticity theory coupled with the wave equation which is solved by using the coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element method small amplitude free vibrations are assumed the three dimensional elasticity theory is suitable for short thick columns and problems involving high frequencies of vibration the non uniform water domain is modeled accurately by using the coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element method the non uniform flexible circular column is modeled accurately by using the hierarchical finite element method the analysis considers the combined effects of water compressibility and gravity surface waves the example of a tapered cantilever circular column is used to illustrate the method examples of stepped and parabolic cantilever circular columns are also considered to validate the method convergence and comparison studies are conducted for the cycle frequencies modal deflections and modal hydrodynamic pressures of a prismatic cantilever circular column in full contact with water new results for the cycle frequencies of tapered single stepped and parabolic cantilever circular columns in contact with water are presented the effect of the taper ratio on the cycle frequencies modal deflections modal bending stresses and modal hydrodynamic pressures is examined and discussed 2 formulation consider a tapered cantilever circular column surrounded by water as shown in fig 1 the water extends to infinity in the radial direction the axis of revolution is the z axis a cylindrical coordinate system r θ z is used to describe the geometry of the column and the hydrodynamic pressure 2 1 fluid the water is assumed to be compressible inviscid and irrotational the wave heights are assumed to be sufficiently small so that the linear wave

governing equations of the coupled system considering the pressure gradient in the normal direction to the face n we have 49 p n ρ n t 2 u t 2 o n γ 1 where n n r 0 n z t the equations of free motion

standard eigenvalue computation methods are applicable after assembling elements and applying essential boundary conditions the generalized eigenvalue problem of eq 55 is solved for the natural frequencies and the generalized displacements of the column together with the natural frequencies and the generalized hydrodynamic pressures however the natural frequencies and the generalized hydrodynamic pressures remain constant for different values of the density of the column the natural frequencies of the hydrodynamic pressure are associated with acoustic and sloshing modes the modal displacements of the column are obtained by using eq 27 the modal strains and modal stresses of the column are obtained by using eq 34 and eq 6 respectively the hydrodynamic pressure is obtained by using eq 7 5 numerical results and discussion by using the formulation described in the previous sections the natural frequencies modal deflections modal bending stresses and modal hydrodynamic pressures for the free flexural vibration of water column interaction systems are determined in the calculations it is assumed that the density of the column is 2450 kg m 3 and the density of water is 1000 kg m 3 the elasticity modulus of the column is 2 94 10 10 n m 2 the speed of sound in water is 1531 m s and the acceleration of gravity is 9 81 m s 2 numerical results are presented for the cycle frequencies normalized modal deflections normalized bending stresses and normalized hydrodynamic pressures of the lowest three flexural modes 5 1 validation study to validate the numerical method described in the previous sections convergence and comparison studies are performed a convergence study of the cycle frequencies as a function of q is performed for two tapered circular columns surrounded by water the first column is in full contact with water h w h whereas the second column is in partial contact with water h w 0 5 h the geometrical properties of the tapered circular column are a 2 m b 1 m and h 20 m the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are calculated by increasing q from 3 to 10 with a 1 increment the results of the column in full contact with water and the column in partial contact with water are plotted in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively it can be seen from the figures that the cycle frequencies converge rapidly downwards as q is increased for problems with quasi uniform meshes the asymptotic rate of convergence of the hierarchical finite element method in energy norm has been shown to be at least twice that of the finite element method babuška et al 1981 for a fixed q the number of degrees of freedom used for the column in partial contact with water is larger than that of the column in full contact with water which leads to a relatively faster convergence for instance for q 10 the numbers of degrees of freedom for the column in full contact with water and the column in partial contact of water are obtained as 430 and 750 respectively convergence up to two significant figures is obtained using q 10 the converged cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes of the column in full contact with water are calculated as 5 33 hz 21 57 hz and 49 99 hz the converged cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes of the column in partial contact with water are calculated as 6 22 hz 23 21 hz and 52 81 hz the converged cycle frequencies of the column in full contact with water are lower than those of the column in partial contact with water this is because the added mass effect on the column in full contact with water is higher than that on the column in partial contact with water in subsequent calculations q is taken as 10 unless otherwise stated a comparison study is now performed for the cycle frequencies of a prismatic cantilever circular column in full contact with water h w h and in partial contact with water h w 0 8 h the height of the column is 20 m the slenderness ratio is 0 01 the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are calculated by increasing q from 3 to 10 with a 1 increment the results are shown in table 1 along with the values obtained analytically by zhou and liu 2007 by using the euler bernoulli beam theory coupled with torsion it can be seen from the table that the cycle frequencies converge rapidly downwards as q is increased and the converged values are accurate up to two significant figures because the column is slender the converged cycle frequencies are in excellent agreement with those from zhou and liu 2007 comparison studies are also performed for modal deflections and modal hydrodynamic pressures of a prismatic cantilever circular column in full contact with water the height and the radius of the column are 20 m and 0 5 m respectively the normalized modal deflections u ξ 0 θ 0 ζ and normalized hydrodynamic pressures p α 0 θ 0 β for the lowest three flexural modes are plotted in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively comparisons are made with analytical solutions obtained by han and xu 1996 the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are 1 03 6 41 and 17 82 it can be seen from the figures that the shapes of the curves predicted by the two methods are similar the differences in modal deflections observed in fig 6 are due to the bernoulli euler beam theory which is used in han and xu 1996 to model the column the differences in hydrodynamic pressures observed in fig 7 are due to water compressibility gravity surface waves and acceleration of the column outer surface in han and xu 1996 the water compressibility and gravity surface waves are neglected and the acceleration of the column outer surface is based on the euler bernoulli beam theory a comparison between the cycle frequencies predicted by the three dimensional elasticity theory and the euler bernoulli beam theory is finally performed for this purpose we consider a prismatic cantilever circular column in full contact with water h w h the height of the column is 20 m the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are calculated by varying the slenderness ratio from 0 003 to 0 05 with a variable increment the results are plotted in fig 8 along with those obtained analytically by han and xu 1996 by using the euler bernoulli beam theory it can be seen from the figure that the cycle frequencies predicted by the euler bernoulli beam theory deviate from the three dimensional solutions as the slenderness ratio or the mode number is increased this is because the euler bernoulli beam theory neglects the effects of transverse shear deformations 5 2 parametric study a parametric study is initially conducted on a tapered cantilever circular column in contact with water the selected varying non dimensional parameters are the slenderness and taper ratios the column height is taken as 20 m the slenderness ratio a h is increased from 0 02 to 0 1 with a 0 02 increment the taper ratio b a is increased from 0 2 to 1 0 with a 0 2 increment the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes of the column in full contact with water and the column in partial contact with water are presented in table 2 and table 3 respectively when the column vibrates the water accelerates producing an additional force equal to the product of the displaced mass of water and the acceleration of the column this mass of water is called added mass it can be seen from the tables that the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes increase with increasing slenderness ratio as expected the cycle frequencies for the fundamental mode decrease with increasing taper ratio this is because the radial component of the acceleration vector of water in the fundamental mode does not change direction along the height of the column and increases with increasing taper ratio which leads to an increase in the added mass effect the cycle frequencies for the second and third modes increase with increasing taper ratio this is because the acceleration vectors of water in the second and third modes change direction along the column height which leads to a decrease in the added mass effect the maximum fundamental cycle frequency is not produced by the prismatic column the cycle frequencies of the column in full contact with water are higher than those of the column in partial contact with water this is because the added mass effect on the column in full contact with water is higher than that on the column in partial contact with water the normalized modal deflections u ξ 0 θ 0 ζ the normalized modal bending stresses σ z z ξ θ 0 ζ 0 and the normalized hydrodynamic pressures p α 0 θ 0 β for the lowest three flexural modes of a tapered circular column in full contact with water h h w 20 m are presented in fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 respectively we know that ε θ θ ε r r at r 0 to compute the modal bending stress σ z z at r 0 we replace ε θ θ by ε r r to circumvent the indeterminate form of ε θ θ the slenderness ratio is taken as 0 1 the taper ratio is increased from 0 2 to 1 0 with a 0 4 increment it can be seen from fig 9 that changes in the taper ratio lead to significant changes in the column curvature in the vicinity of the clamped edge which means that the modal bending stress σ z z changes significantly in the vicinity of the clamped edge as the taper ratio is changed this is confirmed by fig 10 which shows significant changes in the modal bending stress σ z z at the clamped edge as the taper ratio is changed it can also be seen from fig 11 that changes in the taper ratio lead to changes in the hydrodynamic pressure as expected the changes increase with increasing mode number this is due to the added mass which changes as the mode number or the taper ratio is changed the proposed numerical method can be applied to columns with stepped and curvilinear radius variations fig 12 shows a single stepped cantilever circular column in full contact with water the radius a radius b and height h are 0 2 m 0 1 m and 10 m respectively the column is modeled by three hierarchical finite elements the water domain is modeled by one hierarchical finite element and two coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite elements the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are calculated by increasing q from 3 to 10 with a 1 increment the results are presented in table 4 fig 13 shows a parabolic cantilever circular column in full contact with water the radius a radius b and height h are 0 2 m 0 2 m and 10 m respectively the column is modeled by ten hierarchical finite elements the water domain is modeled by ten coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite elements the cycle frequencies for the lowest three flexural modes are computed by increasing q from 3 to 8 with a 1 increment the results are presented in table 5 the tables show a fast convergence downwards as q is increased 6 conclusion this paper presents a simple and highly accurate numerical method to compute the natural frequencies modal displacements modal stresses and modal hydrodynamic pressures for the free flexural vibration of water column interaction systems small amplitude free vibrations are assumed a hierarchical finite element based on the three dimensional elasticity theory is used to model the flexible circular column and a coordinate ascent hierarchical infinite element based on the linear wave equation is used to model the water domain the effects of water compressibility and gravity surface waves are considered simultaneously in the analysis the method is illustrated with the example of a tapered cantilever circular column in contact with water examples of stepped and parabolic cantilever circular columns are also shown the method is validated through convergence study and comparison with analytical results based on the euler bernoulli beam theory for the cycle frequencies modal deflections and modal hydrodynamic pressures of a prismatic cantilever circular column in full contact with water the cycle frequencies predicted by the euler bernoulli beam theory show deviation from the three dimensional solutions as the slenderness ratio or the mode number is increased new results for the cycle frequencies of tapered single stepped and parabolic cantilever circular columns surrounded by water are presented which may serve as a basis of comparison for other methods the cycle frequencies modal deflections modal bending stresses and modal hydrodynamic pressures are shown to be notably affected by the taper ratio

22107,compression after impact tests were used to investigate the impact resistance of composite panel with hat stiffener filled with foam via good energy absorption the low speed impact tests were conducted on three different locations and then fringe projection profilometry was used to measure the full field deflection of composite panels during compression the experimental results show that local buckling occurs during compression of the free impacted panels and material compression damage of the impacted panels is caused by impact damage the residual compressive strength of the stiffened panels is different because of damage of the stiffened panels at different impact locations finally finite element simulation was performed to analyze the damage propagation in the compression after impact and the effect on the ultimate failure the strain history full field deflection and numerical simulation results are of reference significance for the impact resistance design of hat stiffened composite panels keywords low speed impact compression after impact composite stiffened panel foam filled hat stiffener 1 introduction fiber reinforced resin composites are commonly used in the marine industry due to their better corrosion resistance higher specific strength and design freedom compared to metal or wood kolanu et al 2016 tarfaoui and el moumen 2018 tran et al 2018 the composite panel with foam filled hat stiffener ffhs is suitable for marine engineering structures sutherland 2018a the hat stiffener geometric features are fully enclosed with many geometric

composite industry zhang et al 2013 ismail et al 2019 cantwell and morton 1991 bibo and hogg 1996 a low speed impact such as tool drop during maintenance floating objects impact is one of the most common threats for conventional composite panels used in marine and ship structures balıkoğlu et al 2018 zenkert 2009 if the ffhs composite panel was impacted by objects there would be a small permanent indentation in the skin and the stiffness of the impacted panel would decrease sutherland and soares 2012 abrate 2005 2011 richardson and wisheart 1996 in particular the composite panel with local damage will have more complex buckling and post buckling phenomenon which will cause local large deformation including fiber fracture matrix cracking delamination debonding and stiffener skin separation and finally lead to structure sudden failure li and chen 2016 cestino et al 2016 ouyang et al 2018 therefore it is important to study the mechanical behavior of foam core hat stiffened composite panel under low speed impact and the residual strength under compression after impact cai many scholars have performed experiments and numerical studies on impact and cai behaviors of composite laminates to investigate the mechanism of impact damage propagation and its effect on residual compression strength wang et al 2019 established an analysis model using the energy principle and variational method in applied mechanics as a result the residual strength of synthetic foam sandwich panels with lattice webs was predicted yang et al 2015 manufactured foam filled sandwich panels using six types of face sheets including pure carbon fiber glass fiber and mixed fiber via a vacuum assisted resin injection process the impact response and residual strength of different sandwich panels were then studied via cai experiments although the numerical model can be used to analyze and optimize the design of the cai composite structure and the buckling characteristics can be accurately predicted a large number of experimental data are needed to strictly verify the correctness of the numerical models sutherland and soares 2005 sutherland 2018b moreover it is necessary to reveal and confirm the cai failure mechanism especially the similarities and differences of failure mechanisms at different impact locations have not been fully considered feng et al 2016 sun et al 2018a the development and evolution of buckling modes are the basic characteristics of marine stiffened panel deformation by establishing a numerical model to analyze and optimize the design of cai composite structures their buckling characteristics can be accurately predicted the key aspect is to use an abundance of experimental data to strictly verify the correctness of the numerical model advanced experimental measurement techniques can be used to effectively monitor the deformation process of composite stiffened panels cucinotta et al 2016 fringe projection profilometry fpp has the advantages of non contact full field measurement zhang 2018 van der jeught and dirckx 2016 moreover this approach facilitates the monitoring of the deflection characteristics of whole composite stiffened panels in the process of compression buckling and allows for the effective analysis of the compression buckling behavior of composite stiffened panels based on experimental data the buckling behaviors of stiffened panels under the load of shear or compression were studied using the fpp bai et al 2017 2018 lei et al 2012 2016 liu et al 2019 and the cai behavior of composite foam core sandwich panels using digital image correlation bai et al 2019 in contrast the fpp is more suitable for the study of the cai behavior of the composite stiffened panel with discontinuous surface in order to investigate the cai behavior of ffhs composite panel in this study the impact tests with different low speeds and locations and the cai tests of the ffhs composite panels were performed the fpp was used for full field deflection detection of the panels according to the strain gauges and optical measurement the buckling evolution behavior of the panels during cai testing is analyzed and the effect of different impact damage locations on the compression residual strength is discussed finally a finite element model was established to determine the damage propagation mode and ultimate failure modes of the panel during compression testing after impact at different locations and the numerical results were compared to the experimental data 2 principle of fpp to analyze the failure modes of the composite stiffened panels after impact at different locations the fpp was used to measure their full field buckling during compression experiments fig 1 shows a typical fpp optical layout c and p represent the location of the camera and projector respectively q represents a point on the object surface to be measured p r and c r are projections of the line pq and cq on the reference plane respectively without considering the influence of non linear error standard sinusoidal fringes are projected from the projector and reflected by the surface of the measured object which are then captured by the camera the intensity of the signal acquired by the camera can be expressed as follows 1 i i x y i 0 x y i m x y sin φ x y i δ where i 0 is the direct current component and is susceptible to ambient light i m is the fundamental frequency modulation amplitude and is susceptible to the reflectivity of the surface when the standard sinusoidal fringes are twisted by the object s surface the phase value ϕ contains the height information of the point q if the n step phase shifting method is used then δ 2π n is the phase shifting quantity and i 1 2 n corresponds to each step of the phase shift the expression for the phase value ϕ is obtained by the least square method as follows 2 ϕ w x y arctan i 1 n i i x y cos i δ i 1 n i i x y sin i δ the wrapped phase ϕ w π π is obtained this arctangent function which is related to ϕ as follows 3 ϕ ϕ w 2kπ where k is a positive integer and the process of solving for k is called phase unwrapping there have been numerous studies on the related phase unwrapping algorithm we choose a dual frequency unwrapping algorithm yu et al 2017 here that can be used to measure the surface morphology of discontinuous objects stably using the same method to measure the reference plane the phase ϕ 0 can be obtained therefore the phase difference δϕ can be obtained as 4 δϕ ϕ ϕ 0 for a linear fpp system zhang et al 2018 with cp p r c r as shown in fig 1 the height h at the point q is obtained by using the triangular similarity relation δcpq δc r p r q which is related to the phase difference δϕ of the point as 5 h l p δ φ 2 π d p δ φ where l and d are the distances from the camera to the reference plane and the projector respectively and p is the pitch of the fringes they are invariants in the measurement so they can be inversely solved via calibration subsequently the morphology of the object can be reconstructed by solving for the phase difference δϕ in the experiment the wrapped phase was obtained using a four step phase shifting method and the unwrapped phase was then obtained using a multi frequency unwrapping algorithm the gamma error was eliminated using an inverse phase method lei et al 2015 before the experiment a calibration block was used to calibrate the system and the relationship between the height and phase difference was obtained by least square fitting after completion of the calibration process the out of plane displacement of the measured object was obtained using eq 5 3 experiment 3 1 sample description four single hat stiffened composite panel specimens with dimensions of 440 mm 260 mm were used the shape and specific size of the sections are shown in fig 2 a the skin and stiffener was made of composite material zt7g lt 03a the single layer thickness was 0 125 mm and the specified length direction of the stiffened panel was 0 among them the skin thickness was 2 mm the laying layer was 45 90 0 45 0 45 45 0 s the hat stiffener thickness was 0 5 mm the laying layer was 45 90 45 0 and the outermost layer of the hat stiffener is 0 the core material is pmi b75 x foam and the panel panel adhesive is lwf 2b adhesive film the core of the hat stiffener was filled with foam core and the filler was filled in the r region at the bottom of the foam core the filler is a zt7g lt 03a one way belt wrapped by one layer of lwf 2b adhesive film fabrication of the panels was performed using the glue bonding and co curing process in this approach the skin initially solidifies and subsequently glue bonding and co curing are performed using the foam and the stiffener the end of the sample was strengthened using glass fiber laminates an image of the specimen is shown in fig 2 b 3 2 impact tests the impact test was carried out on the composite stiffened panel via the impact testing machines btf2000 as shown in fig 3 a in the impact test the drop hammer with known mass was lifted to a known height and released the drop hammer fell freely through two guide rails and the steel impact bar with hemispherical end fixed on the drop hammer impacted the specimen after the rebounded of the drop hammer the pneumatic cylinder of the testing machine was raised to limit the position of the hammer to prevent the secondary impact meanwhile the specimen clamping fixture was designed according to astm d7136 standard as shown in fig 3 b the four corners of the specimen were clamped with point contact to ensure that the stiffened panel was not producing any displacement during the impact test the diameter of the hemispherical impact bar is 12 7 mm as shown in fig 3 c in the impact tests the impact energy was obtained by calculating the product of drop weight mass and height in this study the selection of impact energy was considered as follows according to the experience of artificial visual inspection of impact pit namely the impact pit was invisible to the naked eye at a distance of 1 5 m which was regarded as the principle of no maintenance for the three impact locations in this study the corresponding critical impact energy needed to be determined through three impact experiments in other words three identical stiffened composite panels were tested for each impact location three specimens d e and f had the same impact location at the skin in non foam core region as shown in fig 4 a three specimens g h and i had the same impact location at the center of the skin back of the hat stiffener as shown in fig 4 b three specimens j k and l had the same impact location at the center of the convex surface of the hat stiffener as shown in fig 4 c the impacted specimen photos corresponding to above three locations are shown in fig 4 d f by comparison three specimens a b and c were the intact stiffened panels without impact damage the impact test results of these stiffened panels were summarized in table 1 it can be seen from table 1 that for the impact location when the impact energy is 29 5 j specimen d the corresponding impact pit depth is 1 85 mm which is visible to the naked eye at the distance of 1 5 m decreasing the impact energy to 25 j specimen e the corresponding impact pit depth is 1 48 mm which is slightly visible to the naked eye at the distance of 1 5m the repeated impact test with the impact energy of 25 j specimen f the corresponding impact pit depth is 1 33 mm which is also slightly visible therefore for the impact location the critical impact energy can be determined to be 25 j through the above three impact tests similarly for other impact location the critical impact energy can be determined as 25 j specimen i and the corresponding impact pit depth is 1 56 mm especially to investigate the repeatability of impact tests for the impact location the critical impact energy can be determined as 7 j for three specimens j l the corresponding impact pit depth is close to 1 55 mm for simplicity and comparison specimens a e i and l were selected as the representatives in the study base on the fact that the pit depths of each of the three repeat tests of each type were sufficiently similar the shape of the impact pits was recorded by the optical images as shown in fig 5 in the actual impact test the depth of impact pit decrease with the decrease of impact energy when the impact energy is lower than a threshold value there is no pit but once the pit appears the depth will exceed 1 mm in the impact test the electronic depth micrometer was used to measure the pit depth the micrometer head adopts a hemisphere with a diameter of 3 mm the depth range is 0 25 4 mm and the resolution is 1 μm before the measurement of the pit depth the micrometer was pressed against a flat surface and set to zero then the micrometer was pressed against the upper surface of the impact pit meanwhile the micrometer was moved back and forth along the directions of 0 45 90 and 135 respectively to ensure that the whole pit area was covered finally the maximum depth was recorded as the pit depth 3 3 cai tests the design of compression experiment is based on the standard astm d 7137 after assembling the lower fixture and two pairs of wedge shape blocks the upper pressure head was assembled to the testing machine the specimen was placed vertically in the fixture the testing machine was then carefully adjusted to slowly come into contact with the upper end of the specimen a digital micrometer was used to position the specimen vertically and the upper end of the specimen was fixed to limit all displacements except for the displacement in the compression direction as shown in fig 6 a then the wedge shape blocks of the fixture were adjusted by the bolts to contact with the both sides of the specimen in a simply supporting contact condition as show in fig 6 b the off plane displacements of the sides of the specimen were limited but the off plane rotations of the sides of the specimen were not affected in this study strain gauges were used to monitor the deformation state of specimens to ensure that the gauges stuck firmly to the specimens their surface was polished by 100 200 220 320 mesh sandpapers in order to increase the surface roughness then the specimen surface was cleaned using ethanol and the gauges were subsequently pasted at the front and back of the panels in pairs as shown in fig 2 for example positions 5 5 represent the corresponding pasted position at the front no 5 and the back no 5 of the panel respectively finally white paint was uniformly sprayed on the front of the stiffened panel for fpp optical measurement before the formal test a pre loading test less than 10 of the limit load was performed to make sure that the strain on the symmetrical positions of the specimen was similar after adjustment of the fixture and specimen position the results of the pre loading test confirmed that the clamp test machine controller and strain gauge measurement components were all in good working order and that the load can be transferred smoothly the universal testing machine ccs20t was used to apply compression load during the test and the displacement control mode was adopted which maintained the displacement loading rate as 0 5 mm min until the specimen failed during the experiment groups of multi frequency fringes were projected onto the specimen using a projector tlp x2000 at a speed of 4 fps the fringes were captured by a digital camera f 080b and the acquired data was post processed and subsequently analyzed the experiment setup is shown in fig 6 c 4 results and discussion 4 1 load displacement curves the load displacement curves of the four stiffened panels that were obtained via compression experiments are shown in fig 7 it is evident that specimen a without impact damage has the highest bearing capacity of approximately 106 kn in contrast the specimens with impact damage in different regions exhibited a significant decrease in the residual compression bearing capacity the ultimate loads for specimen e i and l were 85 8 kn 93 91 kn and 40 6 kn respectively it is evident that even with a similar impact pit depth the damage associated with different impact positions result in different residual compression bearing capacities for specimen l in particular the impact at the center of the stiffener has the greatest effect on the carrying capacity while the impact in other regions has less effect this is consistent with results reported in references feng et al 2016 sun et al 2018a 4 2 strain time curves the strain history of the four stiffened panels obtained via the compression tests is shown in fig 8 for specimen a without impact damage the strain curve is shown in fig 8 a the strain gauge pairs 6 6 7 7 8 8 data bifurcate at 60 s and 1 1 4 4 9 9 bifurcate at 90 s the bifurcated strain gauge pairs 6 6 7 7 and 8 8 data then accelerates the separation process it shows that the non damage composite stiffened panel presents the different local buckling mode under different loads which is consistent with the observation results in reference ghelli and minak 2011 for the stiffened panels with impact damage specimen e and specimen i the strain curves are shown in fig 8 b and c the overall trend is similar to that of specimen a the strain curve bifurcation phenomenon indicates the initiation of local buckling in the stiffened panels it is noteworthy that for specimen e the strain gauge pairs 7 7 9 9 and the strain gauges 5 8 change abruptly when approaching 80 s moreover for specimen i the strain gauges 4 5 6 7 9 change abruptly when approaching 92 s this phenomenon results from load redistribution caused by delamination of the damaged panels li and chen 2016 ghelli and minak 2011 tan et al 2018 in addition for specimen i almost all the strain gauge pairs change abruptly when approaches 170 s which implies that the stiffener damage leads to the load redistribution according to the characteristics of strain bifurcation the initial buckling load in the compression experiment can be determined the compression buckling load of non destructive stiffened panel specimen a is 91 2 kn which is significantly higher than that of the stiffened panel with impact damage 72 3 kn for specimen e and 71 3 kn for specimen i it is noted that for specimen e and specimen i although the impact damage locations on the panels are different there are similar compression buckling loads especially for specimen l with impact damage at the stiffener convex side the fluctuation of the strain curves is shown in fig 8 d the trend of the strain gauge data is consistent without bifurcation which indicates that no obvious local buckling is evident until the stiffener damage occurs in several reports tuo et al 2019a rhead et al 2017 it has been shown that local buckling induces and guides the delamination damage it was shown also in reference ouyang et al 2018 that the delamination damage also contributes to local buckling however in reference sun et al 2018b it was shown that the cai stiffener panel failure process is progressive because the failure of the impacted stiffener results in the overall bending of the panel and the delamination growth between the stiffener and the panel in this study the experimental results show that specimens e and specimen i that were impacted on their panel experienced an abrupt change in the strain data this indicates the occurrence of delamination growth in the panels the failure of specimen l before buckling indicates that the impact damage at the stiffener convex side is fatal to the hat stiffened panel this is because the impact does not only damage the stiffener fiber that bears a significant component of the load but also introduce pre bending resulting in the advanced instability of the panel 4 3 full field buckling results the evolution of the buckling modes is the basic characteristics of the stiffened panel structure deformation and the fpp measurement result of specimen a is shown in fig 9 a there is significant buckling waveform on the panel on either side of the stiffener which has four almost symmetric peaks and troughs distributed at the left and right sides this phenomenon is consistent with the observation results in reference feng et al 2016 and the strain trend shown in fig 8 a for the stiffened panels with impact damage at different locations specimen e and specimen i their buckling modes are consistent with that of the non impact panel specimen a as shown in fig 9 b and c the corresponding strain curves as shown in fig 8 b c are also consistent with that of fig 9 a however the degree of local buckling is more severe than that of the non impact panel specimen a which indicates that the impact damage at different positions on the panel does not change the buckling mode of the stiffened panel but will aggravate the buckling of the panel which results in the decrease of the residual strength of the damaged stiffened panel it is worth noting that for specimen l with impact damage at the stiffener convex side as shown in fig 9 d there is no obvious local buckling because the stiffness of the damaged stiffener is reduced this induces delamination failure as the load increases and results in bending of the entire panel the buckling result is also consistent with the strain curves shown in fig 8 d from this analysis it is evident that the full field displacement distribution can effectively visualize the local buckling mode and its evolution which is helpful in explaining the structural deformation corresponding to the strain curves 4 4 finite element simulation the stiffened panel consists of the skin stiffener foam and filler the stacking sequence of skin is 45 90 0 45 0 45 45 0 s and that of the stiffener is 45 90 45 0 the ply thickness of the skin and stiffener is 0 125 mm in both cases and their mechanical properties are shown in tables 2 and 3 in the abaqus software the low velocity impacts for different energies and impact positions on the stiffened panels were respectively simulated and the integrated modeling method was adopted cohesive elements with zero thickness were inserted into gaps between the joint parts because the use of traditional shell elements together with cohesive elements proved to be the fastest method and the relative error of the cai strength was less than 4 soto et al 2018 in this study the sc8r continuous shell element was used for the stiffener and skin modeling while the c3d8r solid element was used for the foam and r zone filler the coh3d8 solid element was used for the rubber layer and the c3d8r solid element was used for the impact head the hat stiffener was filled with foam core of which the bottom was filled with r zone filler a tie binding connection was adopted between different parts fig 10 a shows the finite element model of the non impact stiffened panel the boundary condition under low velocity impact is quadrilateral clamping to ensure the accuracy and computational efficiency of the finite element numerical simulation results the grid was denser near the impact center and relatively sparse at a certain distance from the impact center abaqus explicit was adopted to simulate the failure process of the stiffened panel under low speed impact the required impact velocity was determined according to the impact energy the impact locations including the center of the back of the stiffener in the foam core region the center of the stiffener convex side in the foam core region and the intersection of the stiffened panel longitudinal symmetric line and the unilateral panel symmetric line as shown in fig 4 a c in the finite element software abaqus the restart method was used to introduce the panel impacted results as the initial state into the cai finite element simulation the boundary condition of cai is that the two sides of the panel apply a normal constraint the bottom end is fixed and the upper end applies a displacement compression load as shown in fig 10 b the mesh division is consistent with the impact model a variety of failure criteria and damage evolution methods have been evaluated li et al 2019 and hashin criterion hashin 1980 which has the advantages of a simple expression and conservative prediction is recommended to analyze the low speed impact failure and cai behavior of composite panels as shown in table 4 among them σ ij is the stress component α is a coefficient 0 α 1 that accounts for the shear stress σ 12 contribution to fiber breakage in tension criterion x x c are the longitudinal tensile and compression strength respectively y y c are the transverse tensile and compression strength respectively and s t s l are the longitudinal and transverse shear strength respectively if the stress component of the element satisfied any of the equations in table 4 the corresponding failure mode was considered introducing a custom subroutine the stiffness degradation criterion is adopted in the damage analysis of the stiffened panel in which fv1 represents matrix tensile failure fv2 represents the matrix compression failure fv3 represents fiber tensile failure and fv4 represents the fiber compression failure when the aforementioned variable i e fv1 4 arrives 1 it implies that the corresponding material damage and the structural begin to failure 1 buckling mode the eigenvalue method is a linear buckling analysis method based on the linear elastic theory of small displacement and small strain its buckling load is determined by the linear generalized eigenvalue equation namely 6 k 0 λ k σ q 0 because of the eccentricity of loading manufacturing defects anisotropy of composite materials and other factors the eigenvalue method for solving linear buckling is not valid therefore it is necessary to model the practical composite panels considering the nonlinear effect and large deflection via nonlinear buckling theory according to the nonlinear buckling theory the equilibrium equation needs to be built on the structure with constant deformation and the incremental equation to be solved is 7 k t q δ q δ z q where k t is the tangent stiffness matrix of a certain incremental step in the calculation process δz is the unbalanced force component δq is the incremental displacement vector based on the nonlinear buckling theory the aforementioned numerical model was established to predict the compressive buckling characteristics of the damaged composite stiffened panel and the correctness of the prediction model was evaluated by comparison with the fpp measurement results for the non impact stiffened panel as shown in fig 11 a the numerical simulation predicted panel compressive buckling left and the fpp measurement results right both show the alternation form of the wave packet trough but the number of troughs is different for specimen e as shown in fig 11 b although the smooth region on the other side of the panel was not impacted it still exhibited a symmetric buckling distribution for specimen i as shown in fig 11 c its buckling region is widely distributed on both sides of the panel in contrast for specimen l as shown in fig 11 d the buckling region is concentrated near the stiffener and the impact damage is mainly distributed on the stiffener the much lower value of the compressive bearing capacity of specimen l compared to that of specimen i can be explained from the panel buckling failure mode because the stiffener determines the compressive bearing capacity of the stiffened panel for the specimens with impact damage specimens e i and l as shown in fig 11 b d it can be determined that the local buckling region is generally connected this indicates that there is delamination in the panel damage mode resulting in buckling extension which is consistent with the results in reference ouyang et al 2018 it is evident from fig 12 c d that the local buckling starts from the affected region and propagates along the width direction to the two outer boundaries which is consistent with the observation results in reference tuo et al 2019b by comparing the buckling distribution of finite element simulation and the fpp measurement results some differences are observed in addition the buckling mode of the stiffened panel that is compressed after impact in the non foam core region exhibits a symmetry that is inconsistent with the asymmetric damage mode indicating that the effect of invisible impact damage on the smooth sides is limited 2 damage analysis fig 12 show the final compression failure photos of the stiffened panels with different impact locations it can be seen that the ultimate failure parts of the panels are all in the middle of the stiffeners and all of the main failure modes are fiber fracture according to the failure results of the stiffened panels the different impact locations have minor effect on the ultimate failure mode of the stiffened panels the buckling mode is closely related to the damage distribution and evolution in cai stiffened panels tuo et al 2019b abir et al 2017 the damage development and distribution mode of cai stiffened panels under different impact damages are shown in the following figures when the stiffened panel without the impact damage specimen a is loaded with the ultimate load the maximum deformation is concentrated in the middle region of the stiffener indicating that the stiffener determines the bearing capability of the non impact stiffened panel as shown in fig 13 the failure regions are mainly concentrated on the stiffener and the edge of the panel the main failure modes are the matrix tensile failure and fiber compression failure fig 14 shows the cai numerical simulation of the stiffened panel specimen e there are mainly fiber compression failure and matrix tensile failure in the panel structure under the ultimate load the panel bends toward the stiffener convex side during the compression process the delamination caused by the impact damage extends in the smooth panel more easily which leads to the extensive distribution of fiber compression matrix compression and matrix tensile damage fig 15 shows the cai numerical simulation of the stiffened panel specimen i it was determined that there is mainly fiber compression failure in the entire panel structure and the failure parts concentrate on the stiffener fig 16 shows the cai numerical simulation of the stiffened panel specimen l it was determined that mainly fiber compression and matrix compression failure occurred in the entire panel structure and the failure parts concentrate on the middle of the stiffener it was evident that the stiffener is the most vulnerable region of the stiffened panel which is consistent with the conclusion in ye et al 2019 the reason is that the stiffener was the main load bearing structure in the panel resulting in the damage sensitivity secondly the stiffness difference between the stiffener and the panel was prominent and therefore the bonding parts between them are prone to delamination damage 4 5 some considerations the geometric features of the hat stiffener are fully enclosed with many geometric parameters and large optimization space the hat stiffened composite panel is widely used in the composite industry if the form of hollow closed thin wall panel was impacted by objects the stiffness of the impacted panel would decrease which would lead to the mechanical properties of the structure deviated from the design in this study it is considered to fill the hat stiffener cavity with foam and take advantage of the good energy absorption of soft materials so the impact resistance of the structure is expected to be improved based on the idea of reinforcement element this study designs and processes the single ffhs composite panel through the cai experiment and fe simulation the effectiveness of the measures to improve the impact resistance is investigated the strain history full field deflection and numerical simulation are of reference significance for the impact resistance design of hat stiffened composite panels some considerations can be obtained from the study 1 the impact location affects the residual compression strength of stiffened panels it is evident that even with a similar impact pit depth the damage associated with different impact locations results in different residual compression strength as shown in fig 7 for specimen l in particular the impact at the center of the stiffener has the greatest effect on the loading capacity while the impact in other regions has less effect 2 the strain bifurcation phenomenon means the occurrence of local buckling it can be seen from the strain time curve in fig 8 that the strain bifurcation phenomenon occurs in specimens a e and i indicating that the local buckling and post buckling behavior happened by contrast specimen l hasn t had buckling behavior the experimental results show that specimen e and specimen i that were impacted on the skin experienced an abrupt change in the strain data it indicates the occurrence of delamination growth in the panels the failure of specimen l happened before buckling it indicates that the impact damage at the stiffener convex side is fatal to the hat stiffened panel this is because the impact does not only damage the stiffener fiber that bears a significant component of the load but also introduce pre bending resulting in the advanced instability of the panel 3 the impact location affects the delamination damage form in the cai test in section 4 4 it gives the damage development and distribution of composite stiffened panels in the cai test under different impact damages the buckling mode of composite stiffened panels in the cai test is closely related to their damage distribution and development 5 conclusions in this study the cai experiments for stiffened panels were performed and the full field optical measurements were conducted via the fpp the damage evolution during the compression process and the damage influence on the ultimate failure were obtained the main conclusions are summarized based on the experiment results and fe analysis as follows 1 for the stiffened panel impacted at the center of the stiffener convex side the buckling region was concentrated on the nearby stiffener in contrast for the stiffened panel impacted at the center of the backside of stiffener its buckling region was widely distributed on both sides panel given that the stiffener determines the compressive bearing capacity of the stiffened panel the dramatic decrease of the compressive bearing capacity of the stiffened panel impacted at the center of the stiffener convex side can be explained from the panel buckling failure mode 2 damage of the cai stiffened panel is prone to develop inside or near the stiffener including the mode of fiber compression matrix compression and matrix tensile while the fiber tensile damage can be ignored the buckling mode of the stiffened panel impacted at the non foam core region exhibited symmetry that was inconsistent with the damage mode it indicated that the invisible impact damage on the smooth panel has a minor effect on the residual strength of the stiffened panel different impact locations could affect the quantity and mode of the local buckling in the compressed stiffened panel by delamination growth but has a limited effect on the final failure mode of

22107,compression after impact tests were used to investigate the impact resistance of composite panel with hat stiffener filled with foam via good energy absorption the low speed impact tests were conducted on three different locations and then fringe projection profilometry was used to measure the full field deflection of composite panels during compression the experimental results show that local buckling occurs during compression of the free impacted panels and material compression damage of the impacted panels is caused by impact damage the residual compressive strength of the stiffened panels is different because of damage of the stiffened panels at different impact locations finally finite element simulation was performed to analyze the damage propagation in the compression after impact and the effect on the ultimate failure the strain history full field deflection and numerical simulation results are of reference significance for the impact resistance design of hat stiffened composite panels keywords low speed impact compression after impact composite stiffened panel foam filled hat stiffener 1 introduction fiber reinforced resin composites are commonly used in the marine industry due to their better corrosion resistance higher specific strength and design freedom compared to metal or wood kolanu et al 2016 tarfaoui and el moumen 2018 tran et al 2018 the composite panel with foam filled hat stiffener ffhs is suitable for marine engineering structures sutherland 2018a the hat stiffener geometric features are fully enclosed with many geometric parameters and large optimization space jin et al 2015 it is expected to improve the structure impact resistance via using the good energy absorption of soft foam materials which is widely used in the composite industry zhang et al 2013 ismail et al 2019 cantwell and morton 1991 bibo and hogg 1996 a low speed impact such as tool drop during maintenance floating objects impact is one of the most common threats for conventional composite panels used in marine and ship structures balıkoğlu et al 2018 zenkert 2009 if the ffhs composite panel was impacted by objects there would be a small permanent indentation in the skin and the stiffness of the impacted panel would decrease sutherland and soares 2012 abrate 2005 2011 richardson and wisheart 1996 in particular the composite panel with local damage will have more complex buckling and post buckling phenomenon which will cause local large deformation including fiber fracture matrix cracking delamination debonding and stiffener skin separation and finally lead to structure sudden failure li and chen 2016 cestino et al 2016 ouyang et al 2018 therefore it is important to study the mechanical behavior of foam core hat stiffened composite panel under low speed impact and the residual strength under compression after impact cai many scholars have performed experiments and numerical studies on impact and cai behaviors of composite laminates to investigate the mechanism of impact damage propagation and its effect on residual compression strength wang et al 2019 established an analysis model using the energy principle and variational method in applied mechanics as a result the residual strength of synthetic foam sandwich panels with lattice webs was predicted yang et al 2015 manufactured foam filled sandwich panels using six types of face sheets including pure carbon fiber glass fiber and mixed fiber via a vacuum assisted resin injection process the impact response and residual strength of different sandwich panels were then studied via cai experiments although the numerical model can be used to analyze and optimize the design of the cai composite structure and the buckling characteristics can be accurately predicted a large number of experimental data are needed to strictly verify the correctness of the numerical models sutherland and soares 2005 sutherland 2018b moreover it is necessary to reveal and confirm the cai failure mechanism especially the similarities and differences of failure mechanisms at different impact locations have not been fully considered feng et al 2016 sun et al 2018a the development and evolution of buckling modes are the basic characteristics of marine stiffened panel deformation by establishing a numerical model to analyze and optimize the design of cai composite structures their buckling characteristics can be accurately predicted the key aspect is to use an abundance of experimental data to strictly verify the correctness of the numerical model advanced experimental measurement techniques can be used to effectively monitor the deformation process of composite stiffened panels cucinotta et al 2016 fringe projection profilometry fpp has the advantages of non contact full field measurement zhang 2018 van der jeught and dirckx 2016 moreover this approach facilitates the monitoring of the deflection characteristics of whole composite stiffened panels in the process of compression buckling and allows for the effective analysis of the compression buckling behavior of composite stiffened panels based on experimental data the buckling behaviors of stiffened panels under the load of shear or compression were studied using the fpp bai et al 2017 2018 lei et al 2012 2016 liu et al 2019 and the cai behavior of composite foam core sandwich panels using digital image correlation bai et al 2019 in contrast the fpp is more suitable for the study of the cai behavior of the composite stiffened panel with discontinuous surface in order to investigate the cai behavior of ffhs composite panel in this study the impact tests with different low speeds and locations and the cai tests of the ffhs composite panels were performed the fpp was used for full field deflection detection of the panels according to the strain gauges and optical measurement the buckling evolution behavior of the panels during cai testing is analyzed and the effect of different impact damage locations on the compression residual strength is discussed finally a finite element model was established to determine the damage propagation mode and ultimate failure modes of the panel during compression testing after impact at different locations and the numerical results were compared to the experimental data 2 principle of fpp to analyze the failure modes of the composite stiffened panels after impact at different locations the fpp was used to measure their full field buckling during compression experiments fig 1 shows a typical fpp optical layout c and p represent the location of the camera and projector respectively q represents a point on the object surface to be measured p r and c r are projections of the line pq and cq on the reference plane respectively without considering the influence of non linear error standard sinusoidal fringes are projected from the projector and reflected by the surface of the measured object which are then captured by the camera the intensity of the signal acquired by the camera can be expressed as follows 1 i i x y i 0 x y i m x y sin φ x y i δ where i 0 is the direct current component and is susceptible to ambient light i m is the fundamental frequency modulation amplitude and is susceptible to the reflectivity of the surface when the standard sinusoidal fringes are twisted by the object s surface the phase value ϕ contains the height information of the point q if the n step phase shifting method is used then δ 2π n is the phase shifting quantity and i 1 2 n corresponds to each step of the phase shift the expression for the phase value ϕ is obtained by the least square method as follows 2 ϕ w x y arctan i 1 n i i x y cos i δ i 1 n i i x y sin i δ the wrapped phase ϕ w π π is obtained this arctangent function which is related to ϕ as follows 3 ϕ ϕ w 2kπ where k is a positive integer and the process of solving for k is called phase unwrapping there have been numerous studies on the related phase unwrapping algorithm we choose a dual frequency unwrapping algorithm yu et al 2017 here that can be used to measure the surface morphology of discontinuous objects stably using the same method to measure the reference plane the phase ϕ 0 can be obtained therefore the phase difference δϕ can be obtained as 4 δϕ ϕ ϕ 0 for a linear fpp system zhang et al 2018 with cp p r c r as shown in fig 1 the height h at the point q is obtained by using the triangular similarity relation δcpq δc r p r q which is related to the phase difference δϕ of the point as 5 h l p δ φ 2 π d p δ φ where l and d are the distances from the camera to the reference plane and the projector respectively and p is the pitch of the fringes they are invariants in the measurement so they can be inversely solved via calibration subsequently the morphology of the object can be reconstructed by solving for the phase difference δϕ in the experiment the wrapped phase was obtained using a four step phase shifting method and the unwrapped phase was then obtained using a multi frequency unwrapping algorithm the gamma error was eliminated using an inverse phase method lei et al 2015 before the experiment a calibration block was used to calibrate the system and the relationship between the height and phase difference was obtained by least square fitting after completion of the calibration process the out of plane displacement of the measured object was obtained using eq 5 3 experiment 3 1 sample description four single hat stiffened composite panel specimens with dimensions of 440 mm 260 mm were used the shape and specific size of the sections are shown in fig 2 a the skin and stiffener was made of composite material zt7g lt 03a the single layer thickness was 0 125 mm and the specified length direction of the stiffened panel was 0 among them the skin thickness was 2 mm the laying layer was 45 90 0 45 0 45 45 0 s the hat stiffener thickness was 0 5 mm the laying layer was 45 90 45 0 and the outermost layer of the hat stiffener is 0 the core material is pmi b75 x foam and the panel panel adhesive is lwf 2b adhesive film the core of the hat stiffener was filled with foam core and the filler was filled in the r region at the bottom of the foam core the filler is a zt7g lt 03a one way belt wrapped by one layer of lwf 2b adhesive film fabrication of the panels was performed using the glue bonding and co curing process in this approach the skin initially solidifies and subsequently glue bonding and co curing are performed using the foam and the stiffener the end of the sample was strengthened using glass fiber laminates an image of the specimen is shown in fig 2 b 3 2 impact tests the impact test was carried out on the composite stiffened panel via the impact testing machines btf2000 as shown in fig 3 a in the impact test the drop hammer with known mass was lifted to a known height and released the drop hammer fell freely through two guide rails and the steel impact bar with hemispherical end fixed on the drop hammer impacted the specimen after the rebounded of the drop hammer the pneumatic cylinder of the testing machine was raised to limit the position of the hammer to prevent the secondary impact meanwhile the specimen clamping fixture was designed according to astm d7136 standard as shown in fig 3 b the four corners of the specimen were clamped with point contact to ensure that the stiffened panel was not producing any displacement during the impact test the diameter of the hemispherical impact bar is 12 7 mm as shown in fig 3 c in the impact tests the impact energy was obtained by calculating the product of drop weight mass and height in this study the selection of impact energy was considered as follows according to the experience of artificial visual inspection of impact pit namely the impact pit was invisible to the naked eye at a distance of 1 5 m which was regarded as the principle of no maintenance for the three impact locations in this study the corresponding critical impact energy needed to be determined through three impact experiments in other words three identical stiffened composite panels were tested for each impact location three specimens d e and f had the same impact location at the skin in non foam core region as shown in fig 4 a three specimens g h and i had the same impact location at the center of the skin back of the hat stiffener as shown in fig 4 b three specimens j k and l had the same impact location at the center of the convex surface of the hat stiffener as shown in fig 4 c the impacted specimen photos corresponding to above three locations are shown in fig 4 d f by comparison three specimens a b and c were the intact stiffened panels without impact damage the impact test results of these stiffened panels were summarized in table 1 it can be seen from table 1 that for the impact location when the impact energy is 29 5 j specimen d the corresponding impact pit depth is 1 85 mm which is visible to the naked eye at the distance of 1 5 m decreasing the impact energy to 25 j specimen e the corresponding impact pit depth is 1 48 mm which is slightly visible to the naked eye at the distance of 1 5m the repeated impact test with the impact energy of 25 j specimen f the corresponding impact pit depth is 1 33 mm which is also slightly visible therefore for the impact location the critical impact energy can be determined to be 25 j through the above three impact tests similarly for other impact location the critical impact energy can be determined as 25 j specimen i and the corresponding impact pit depth is 1 56 mm especially to investigate the repeatability of impact tests for the impact location the critical impact energy can be determined as 7 j for three specimens j l the corresponding impact pit depth is close to 1 55 mm for simplicity and comparison specimens a e i and l were selected as the representatives in the study base on the fact that the pit depths of each of the three repeat tests of each type were sufficiently similar the shape of the impact pits was recorded by the optical images as shown in fig 5 in the actual impact test the depth of impact pit decrease with the decrease of impact energy when the impact energy is lower than a threshold value there is no pit but once the pit appears the depth will exceed 1 mm in the impact test the electronic depth micrometer was used to measure the pit depth the micrometer head adopts a hemisphere with a diameter of 3 mm the depth range is 0 25 4 mm and the resolution is 1 μm before the measurement of the pit depth the micrometer was pressed against a flat surface and set to zero then the micrometer was pressed against the upper surface of the impact pit meanwhile the micrometer was moved back and forth along the directions of 0 45 90 and 135 respectively to ensure that the whole pit area was covered finally the maximum depth was recorded as the pit depth 3 3 cai tests the design of compression experiment is based on the standard astm d 7137 after assembling the lower fixture and two pairs of wedge shape blocks the upper pressure head was assembled to the testing machine the specimen was placed vertically in the fixture the testing machine was then carefully adjusted to slowly come into contact with the upper end of the specimen a digital micrometer was used to position the specimen vertically and the upper end of the specimen was fixed to limit all displacements except for the displacement in the compression direction as shown in fig 6 a then the wedge shape blocks of the fixture were adjusted by the bolts to contact with the both sides of the specimen in a simply supporting contact condition as show in fig 6 b the off plane displacements of the sides of the specimen were limited but the off plane rotations of the sides of the specimen were not affected in this study strain gauges were used to monitor the deformation state of specimens to ensure that the gauges stuck firmly to the specimens their surface was polished by 100 200 220 320 mesh sandpapers in order to increase the surface roughness then the specimen surface was cleaned using ethanol and the gauges were subsequently pasted at the front and back of the panels in pairs as shown in fig 2 for example positions 5 5 represent the corresponding pasted position at the front no 5 and the back no 5 of the panel respectively finally white paint was uniformly sprayed on the front of the stiffened panel for fpp optical measurement before the formal test a pre loading test less than 10 of the limit load was performed to make sure that the strain on the symmetrical positions of the specimen was similar after adjustment of the fixture and specimen position the results of the pre loading test confirmed that the clamp test machine controller and strain gauge measurement components were all in good working order and that the load can be transferred smoothly the universal testing machine ccs20t was used to apply compression load during the test and the displacement control mode was adopted which maintained the displacement loading rate as 0 5 mm min until the specimen failed during the experiment groups of multi frequency fringes were projected onto the specimen using a projector tlp x2000 at a speed of 4 fps the fringes were captured by a digital camera f 080b and the acquired data was post processed and subsequently analyzed the experiment setup is shown in fig 6 c 4 results and discussion 4 1 load displacement curves the load displacement curves of the four stiffened panels that were obtained via compression experiments are shown in fig 7 it is evident that specimen a without impact damage has the highest bearing capacity of approximately 106 kn in contrast the specimens with impact damage in different regions exhibited a significant decrease in the residual compression bearing capacity the ultimate loads for specimen e i and l were 85 8 kn 93 91 kn and 40 6 kn respectively it is evident that even with a similar impact pit depth the damage associated with different impact positions result in different residual compression bearing capacities for specimen l in particular the impact at the center of the stiffener has the greatest effect on the carrying capacity while the impact in other regions has less effect this is consistent with results reported in references feng et al 2016 sun et al 2018a 4 2 strain time curves the strain history of the four stiffened panels obtained via the compression tests is shown in fig 8 for specimen a without impact damage the strain curve is shown in fig 8 a the strain gauge pairs 6 6 7 7 8 8 data bifurcate at 60 s and 1 1 4 4 9 9 bifurcate at 90 s the bifurcated strain gauge pairs 6 6 7 7 and 8 8 data then accelerates the separation process it shows that the non damage composite stiffened panel presents the different local buckling mode under different loads which is consistent with the observation results in reference ghelli and minak 2011 for the stiffened panels with impact damage specimen e and specimen i the strain curves are shown in fig 8 b and c the overall trend is similar to that of specimen a the strain curve bifurcation phenomenon indicates the initiation of local buckling in the stiffened panels it is noteworthy that for specimen e the strain gauge pairs 7 7 9 9 and the strain gauges 5 8 change abruptly when approaching 80 s moreover for specimen i the strain gauges 4 5 6 7 9 change abruptly when approaching 92 s this phenomenon results from load redistribution caused by delamination of the damaged panels li and chen 2016 ghelli and minak 2011 tan et al 2018 in addition for specimen i almost all the strain gauge pairs change abruptly when approaches 170 s which implies that the stiffener damage leads to the load redistribution according to the characteristics of strain bifurcation the initial buckling load in the compression experiment can be determined the compression buckling load of non destructive stiffened panel specimen a is 91 2 kn which is significantly higher than that of the stiffened panel with impact damage 72 3 kn for specimen e and 71 3 kn for specimen i it is noted that for specimen e and specimen i although the impact damage locations on the panels are different there are similar compression buckling loads especially for specimen l with impact damage at the stiffener convex side the fluctuation of the strain curves is shown in fig 8 d the trend of the strain gauge data is consistent without bifurcation which indicates that no obvious local buckling is evident until the stiffener damage occurs in several reports tuo et al 2019a rhead et al 2017 it has been shown that local buckling induces and guides the delamination damage it was shown also in reference ouyang et al 2018 that the delamination damage also contributes to local buckling however in reference sun et al 2018b it was shown that the cai stiffener panel failure process is progressive because the failure of the impacted stiffener results in the overall bending of the panel and the delamination growth between the stiffener and the panel in this study the experimental results show that specimens e and specimen i that were impacted on their panel experienced an abrupt change in the strain data this indicates the occurrence of delamination growth in the panels the failure of specimen l before buckling indicates that the impact damage at the stiffener convex side is fatal to the hat stiffened panel this is because the impact does not only damage the stiffener fiber that bears a significant component of the load but also introduce pre bending resulting in the advanced instability of the panel 4 3 full field buckling results the evolution of the buckling modes is the basic characteristics of the stiffened panel structure deformation and the fpp measurement result of specimen a is shown in fig 9 a there is significant buckling waveform on the panel on either side of the stiffener which has four almost symmetric peaks and troughs distributed at the left and right sides this phenomenon is consistent with the observation results in reference feng et al 2016 and the strain trend shown in fig 8 a for the stiffened panels with impact damage at different locations specimen e and specimen i their buckling modes are consistent with that of the non impact panel specimen a as shown in fig 9 b and c the corresponding strain curves as shown in fig 8 b c are also consistent with that of fig 9 a however the degree of local buckling is more severe than that of the non impact panel specimen a which indicates that the impact damage at different positions on the panel does not change the buckling mode of the stiffened panel but will aggravate the buckling of the panel which results in the decrease of the residual strength of the damaged stiffened panel it is worth noting that for specimen l with impact damage at the stiffener convex side as shown in fig 9 d there is no obvious local buckling because the stiffness of the damaged stiffener is reduced this induces delamination failure as the load increases and results in bending of the entire panel the buckling result is also consistent with the strain curves shown in fig 8 d from this analysis it is evident that the full field displacement distribution can effectively visualize the local buckling mode and its evolution which is helpful in explaining the structural deformation corresponding to the strain curves 4 4 finite element simulation the stiffened panel consists of the skin stiffener foam and filler the stacking sequence of skin is 45 90 0 45 0 45 45 0 s and that of the stiffener is 45 90 45 0 the ply thickness of the skin and stiffener is 0 125 mm in both cases and their mechanical properties are shown in tables 2 and 3 in the abaqus software the low velocity impacts for different energies and impact positions on the stiffened panels were respectively simulated and the integrated modeling method was adopted cohesive elements with zero thickness were inserted into gaps between the joint parts because the use of traditional shell elements together with cohesive elements proved to be the fastest method and the relative error of the cai strength was less than 4 soto et al 2018 in this study the sc8r continuous shell element was used for the stiffener and skin modeling while the c3d8r solid element was used for the foam and r zone filler the coh3d8 solid element was used for the rubber layer and the c3d8r solid element was used for the impact head the hat stiffener was filled with foam core of which the bottom was filled with r zone filler a tie binding connection was adopted between different parts fig 10 a shows the finite element model of the non impact stiffened panel the boundary condition under low velocity impact is quadrilateral clamping to ensure the accuracy and computational efficiency of the finite element numerical simulation results the grid was denser near the impact center and relatively sparse at a certain distance from the impact center abaqus explicit was adopted to simulate the failure process of the stiffened panel under low speed impact the required impact velocity was determined according to the impact energy the impact locations including the center of the back of the stiffener in the foam core region the center of the stiffener convex side in the foam core region and the intersection of the stiffened panel longitudinal symmetric line and the unilateral panel symmetric line as shown in fig 4 a c in the finite element software abaqus the restart method was used to introduce the panel impacted results as the initial state into the cai finite element simulation the boundary condition of cai is that the two sides of the panel apply a normal constraint the bottom end is fixed and the upper end applies a displacement compression load as shown in fig 10 b the mesh division is consistent with the impact model a variety of failure criteria and damage evolution methods have been evaluated li et al 2019 and hashin criterion hashin 1980 which has the advantages of a simple expression and conservative prediction is recommended to analyze the low speed impact failure and cai behavior of composite panels as shown in table 4 among them σ ij is the stress component α is a coefficient 0 α 1 that accounts for the shear stress σ 12 contribution to fiber breakage in tension criterion x x c are the longitudinal tensile and compression strength respectively y y c are the transverse tensile and compression strength respectively and s t s l are the longitudinal and transverse shear strength respectively if the stress component of the element satisfied any of the equations in table 4 the corresponding failure mode was considered introducing a custom subroutine the stiffness degradation criterion is adopted in the damage analysis of the stiffened panel in which fv1 represents matrix tensile failure fv2 represents the matrix compression failure fv3 represents fiber tensile failure and fv4 represents the fiber compression failure when the aforementioned variable i e fv1 4 arrives 1 it implies that the corresponding material damage and the structural begin to failure 1 buckling mode the eigenvalue method is a linear buckling analysis method based on the linear elastic theory of small displacement and small strain its buckling load is determined by the linear generalized eigenvalue equation namely 6 k 0 λ k σ q 0 because of the eccentricity of loading manufacturing defects anisotropy of composite materials and other factors the eigenvalue method for solving linear buckling is not valid therefore it is necessary to model the practical composite panels considering the nonlinear effect and large deflection via nonlinear buckling theory according to the nonlinear buckling theory the equilibrium equation needs to be built on the structure with constant deformation and the incremental equation to be solved is 7 k t q δ q δ z q where k t is the tangent stiffness matrix of a certain incremental step in the calculation process δz is the unbalanced force component δq is the incremental displacement vector based on the nonlinear buckling theory the aforementioned numerical model was established to predict the compressive buckling characteristics of the damaged composite stiffened panel and the correctness of the prediction model was evaluated by comparison with the fpp measurement results for the non impact stiffened panel as shown in fig 11 a the numerical simulation predicted panel compressive buckling left and the fpp measurement results right both show the alternation form of the wave packet trough but the number of troughs is different for specimen e as shown in fig 11 b although the smooth region on the other side of the panel was not impacted it still exhibited a symmetric buckling distribution for specimen i as shown in fig 11 c its buckling region is widely distributed on both sides of the panel in contrast for specimen l as shown in fig 11 d the buckling region is concentrated near the stiffener and the impact damage is mainly distributed on the stiffener the much lower value of the compressive bearing capacity of specimen l compared to that of specimen i can be explained from the panel buckling failure mode because the stiffener determines the compressive bearing capacity of the stiffened panel for the specimens with impact damage specimens e i and l as shown in fig 11 b d it can be determined that the local buckling region is generally connected this indicates that there is delamination in the panel damage mode resulting in buckling extension which is consistent with the results in reference ouyang et al 2018 it is evident from fig 12 c d that the local buckling starts from the affected region and propagates along the width direction to the two outer boundaries which is consistent with the observation results in reference tuo et al 2019b by comparing the buckling distribution of finite element simulation and the fpp measurement results some differences are observed in addition the buckling mode of the stiffened panel that is compressed after impact in the non foam core region exhibits a symmetry that is inconsistent with the asymmetric damage mode indicating that the effect of invisible impact damage on the smooth sides is limited 2 damage analysis fig 12 show the final compression failure photos of the stiffened panels with different impact locations it can be seen that the ultimate failure parts of the panels are all in the middle of the stiffeners and all of the main failure modes are fiber fracture according to the failure results of the stiffened panels the different impact locations have minor effect on the ultimate failure mode of the stiffened panels the buckling mode is closely related to the damage distribution and evolution in cai stiffened panels tuo et al 2019b abir et al 2017 the damage development and distribution mode of cai stiffened panels under different impact damages are shown in the following figures when the stiffened panel without the impact damage specimen a is loaded with the ultimate load the maximum deformation is concentrated in the middle region of the stiffener indicating that the stiffener determines the bearing capability of the non impact stiffened panel as shown in fig 13 the failure regions are mainly concentrated on the stiffener and the edge of the panel the main failure modes are the matrix tensile failure and fiber compression failure fig 14 shows the cai numerical simulation of the stiffened panel specimen e there are mainly fiber compression failure and matrix tensile failure in the panel structure under the ultimate load the panel bends toward the stiffener convex side during the compression process the delamination caused by the impact damage extends in the smooth panel more easily which leads to the extensive distribution of fiber compression matrix compression and matrix tensile damage fig 15 shows the cai numerical simulation of the stiffened panel specimen i it was determined that there is mainly fiber compression failure in the entire panel structure and the failure parts concentrate on the stiffener fig 16 shows the cai numerical simulation of the stiffened panel specimen l it was determined that mainly fiber compression and matrix compression failure occurred in the entire panel structure and the failure parts concentrate on the middle of the stiffener it was evident that the stiffener is the most vulnerable region of the stiffened panel which is consistent with the conclusion in ye et al 2019 the reason is that the stiffener was the main load bearing structure in the panel resulting in the damage sensitivity secondly the stiffness difference between the stiffener and the panel was prominent and therefore the bonding parts between them are prone to delamination damage 4 5 some considerations the geometric features of the hat stiffener are fully enclosed with many geometric parameters and large optimization space the hat stiffened composite panel is widely used in the composite industry if the form of hollow closed thin wall panel was impacted by objects the stiffness of the impacted panel would decrease which would lead to the mechanical properties of the structure deviated from the design in this study it is considered to fill the hat stiffener cavity with foam and take advantage of the good energy absorption of soft materials so the impact resistance of the structure is expected to be improved based on the idea of reinforcement element this study designs and processes the single ffhs composite panel through the cai experiment and fe simulation the effectiveness of the measures to improve the impact resistance is investigated the strain history full field deflection and numerical simulation are of reference significance for the impact resistance design of hat stiffened composite panels some considerations can be obtained from the study 1 the impact location affects the residual compression strength of stiffened panels it is evident that even with a similar impact pit depth the damage associated with different impact locations results in different residual compression strength as shown in fig 7 for specimen l in particular the impact at the center of the stiffener has the greatest effect on the loading capacity while the impact in other regions has less effect 2 the strain bifurcation phenomenon means the occurrence of local buckling it can be seen from the strain time curve in fig 8 that the strain bifurcation phenomenon occurs in specimens a e and i indicating that the local buckling and post buckling behavior happened by contrast specimen l hasn t had buckling behavior the experimental results show that specimen e and specimen i that were impacted on the skin experienced an abrupt change in the strain data it indicates the occurrence of delamination growth in the panels the failure of specimen l happened before buckling it indicates that the impact damage at the stiffener convex side is fatal to the hat stiffened panel this is because the impact does not only damage the stiffener fiber that bears a significant component of the load but also introduce pre bending resulting in the advanced instability of the panel 3 the impact location affects the delamination damage form in the cai test in section 4 4 it gives the damage development and distribution of composite stiffened panels in the cai test under different impact damages the buckling mode of composite stiffened panels in the cai test is closely related to their damage distribution and development 5 conclusions in this study the cai experiments for stiffened panels were performed and the full field optical measurements were conducted via the fpp the damage evolution during the compression process and the damage influence on the ultimate failure were obtained the main conclusions are summarized based on the experiment results and fe analysis as follows 1 for the stiffened panel impacted at the center of the stiffener convex side the buckling region was concentrated on the nearby stiffener in contrast for the stiffened panel impacted at the center of the backside of stiffener its buckling region was widely distributed on both sides panel given that the stiffener determines the compressive bearing capacity of the stiffened panel the dramatic decrease of the compressive bearing capacity of the stiffened panel impacted at the center of the stiffener convex side can be explained from the panel buckling failure mode 2 damage of the cai stiffened panel is prone to develop inside or near the stiffener including the mode of fiber compression matrix compression and matrix tensile while the fiber tensile damage can be ignored the buckling mode of the stiffened panel impacted at the non foam core region exhibited symmetry that was inconsistent with the damage mode it indicated that the invisible impact damage on the smooth panel has a minor effect on the residual strength of the stiffened panel different impact locations could affect the quantity and mode of the local buckling in the compressed stiffened panel by delamination growth but has a limited effect on the final failure mode of

22108,considering the limitation of current direct measurement method for ship damage identification an indirect damage identification method based on dynamic parameters is taken into account a 1500 ton ship simplified as the hull girder is taken as the research object artificial neural network method the coordinate modal confidence comac and modal curvature index are applied to identify the ship s damage under different conditions through numerical experiments migration matrix method is introduced to obtain the damage database the damage identification accuracy of two indexes based on modal

the average accuracy of damage severity reached 95 78 for damage indexes based on modal shapes comac requires less data to identify the damage and has high calculation efficiency but there is a certain range of error when used in conjunction with various modes of the index modal curvature damage localization is relatively accurate both indicators based on modal shapes can reflect the damage degree to some extent but can t accurately identify the specific extent of damage keywords damage detection on ship dynamic parameters bp neural network comac modal curvature 1 introductions with the development of sophisticated weapons in the maritime powers the location and degree of damage caused by various types of weapons to ship in combat have a very important meaning for a ship to continue to fight different from structural health monitoring in civil engineering and the identification of damage in aerospace engineering the explosion damage of the ship is instantaneous which means that there are few effective signals used to analyze the dynamic response of the structure for explosion damage identification the selection of dynamic characteristics analyzed from the special signals is of vital importance most of the researches are mainly aimed at the direct problems of ship structure martin and j sinclair 2012 mckown et al 2008 m zhang et al 2012 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2017 that is to solve the whole or local response of ships with the known input and system of the ship structure such as impact spectrum guo et al 2019 impact environment guo et al 2017 2019 and the studies of vibration and noise reduction explosion tests on real ships are more concerned with the macroscopic response of the structure itself while ignoring microscopic changes of the structure the microscopic structural changes of the ship can be available with the known input and response which is the inverse problem for ship research structural changes caused by the explosion damage usually give rise to the changes of quality stiffness and energy dissipation characteristics of the structure which provides a theoretical basis for ship explosion damage identification based on structural dynamic characteristics in the aspect of damage identification of beam structure different methods have been applied to identify the damage yoon and heider 2009 elshamy et al 2018 hadjileontiadis et al 2005 ciambella et al 2017 which has the possibility of mutual reference for the study of ship damage identification in engineering applications koh b h koh and dyke 2007 proposed a damage identification method for cable stayed bridges based on modal assurance criteria xu xu et al 2011 and other scholars developed the method based on modal strain energy to realize the damage identification of the finite element model of the cable stayed bridge by training the different damage cases of a truss structure through artificial intelligence method and using the modal strain energy method ramin ghiasi ghiasi et al 2018 identified the damage and compared the accuracy behmanesh iman behmanesh et al 2017 used finite element model data to identify the probability of the building and then verified the effectiveness of the model mangal l mangal et al 2001 studied the parameters of the damage of the jacket offshore platform and the process is carried out by using the neural network to identify the pulse excitation load and the vibration response of the jacket offshore platform model results showed good damage recognition effect prashant m pawar pawar et al 2007 took fourier coefficients as input parameter and used neural network method to train parameters to locate and quantify the damage results showed that the method based on fourier coefficients and neural network could accurately identify the beam structure damage tianxiang huang huang et al 2018 developed a baseline free damage location procedure based on the nodal displacement of structural modal shapes to measure the damage of a steel beam and the result was validated with an analytical model a numerical model and experiments ahmet can altunisik altunisik et al 2017 calculated and measured the natural frequencies and mode shapes for undamaged and multiple cracked cantilever beams modal assurance criterion mac and coordinated modal assurance criterion comac factors are obtained from the mode shapes and the correlation between the measured and calculated values for damaged location identification was established j ciambella ciambella and vestroni 2015 developed a filter algorithm to localize the beam type structure damages with the method of perturbative solution based on euler bernoulli equation in the above researches the method of damage identification using natural frequency is universal and general methods based on artificial neural network are widely applied to extract the intrinsic relationship between frequency and damage further constructing the function mapping relationship by training the data is of great significance for the research of the detection of ship damage for modal shape based damage identification particularity arises for ship structure studied in this paper among some researches many of the objects studied are models of small scale and models are mostly the form of simply supported beam or cantilever beam for large scale model with free boundary condition the particularity of various damage indicators based on modal shape method is discussed in this paper methods based on natural frequency and modal shapes to identify the damage are studied using neural network comac and modal curvature migration matrix method is used to obtain the natural frequencies to establish the database and then bp neural network is applied to train the database modal shapes are obtained by ansys the method based on natural frequency for damage identification is more efficient and accurate but it is necessary to establish a database containing enough damage cases however the method based on mode shape does not need to establish the database there is a correspondence between mode shape and geometric position information of the structure which can be used to realize damage identification of the structure the applicability stability and accuracy of the two dynamic parameters based methods in the hull girder model application were discussed two different methods are compared and analyzed so as to provide reference for damage identification in real ship 2 theoretical hypothesis of ship explosion damage ship explosion damage usually results in the stiffness loss of the hull girder structural dynamic parameters natural frequency and modal shape etc are affected to different extent so that the ship structure shows difference of the dynamic response characteristics from the intact structure liu 2017 when the ship is damaged by an external weapon the damage can lead to a small change in the quality of the hull which is negligible compared with the quality of the whole ship however the local stiffness of the ship will then change greatly which can cause the change of its dynamic parameters in this paper the ship explosion damage is simulated by changing the stiffness the damage degree is expressed by the amount of stiffness loss and is determined by formula 1 1 k n α n k n where k n is the stiffness of the n th intact unit of the hull girder k n is the stiffness of the n th damaged unit α n is the damage degree of the n th unit 3 ship damage identification methods natural frequencies and modal shapes are used to identify the damage according to the particularity of the damage identification of the hull girder the theory of ship explosion damage identification will be given as below 3 1 method based on the natural frequency 3 1 1 natural frequency based damage identification theory the natural frequency change sun 2016 caused by the stiffness loss can be expressed as 2 k δ k ω 2 δ ω 2 m x δ x 0 assuming that the mass stays the same after the damage and ignoring the second order items the natural frequency change is written as 3 δ w i 2 x i t δ k x i x i t m x i where k refers to the structural stiffness matrix δ k refers to the change in stiffness matrix m is the mass matrix ω refers to the natural frequency of the structure δ ω refers to the change in natural frequency x refers to the structural modal displacement δ x is the change of the structural mode displacement and i represents the i th mode when the ship is damaged both δ ω i and δ k are related to the damaged unit n 4 δ ω i f i δ k n formula 4 can be expanded by using the taylor s formula ignoring the higher order item formula 5 can be obtained 5 δ ω i f i 0 n δ k f i δ k 0 n when the ship has not been damaged at the damage position 6 f 0 n 0 then formula 5 can also be written as 7 δ ω i δ k h i n similarly the change in the natural frequency of the j th order δ ω j can be written as 8 δ ω j δ k h j n assuming that the change of ship stiffness is independent of natural frequency from 7 8 we obtain 9 δ ω i δ ω j h i n h j n h n therefore the change ratio of the natural frequency of any two modes in the damaged condition is only related to the damage position n however the same change in natural frequency may occur in spite of different damage conditions so it is difficult to accurately judge the damage condition only from the change of the natural frequency of by using only one mode the integrated use of the appropriate number of modes will help determine the uniqueness of the changes to accurately identify the damage in this paper natural frequencies of the first five modes are selected as the parameters for damage identification 3 1 2 damage identification parameters acquired by migration matrix method natural frequencies of the first five modes of the hull girder are obtained by the migration matrix method the hull girder is divided into 20 segments and the mass and stiffness are assumed to be evenly distributed on each segment see appendix for detailed derivation each segment has state vectors on its left and right end investigating the transfer and change of the state vectors through a beam section and joint the following equation 10 can be obtained 10 x 20 r s 1 s 2 s 3 s i s 20 x 1 l where x i is the state vector of the i th unit s i is the inter span matrix the boundary conditions of the two free ends of the hull girder are given as 11 m 1 r f 1 r 0 m 20 l f 20 l 0 returning formula 11 to formula 10 the first five mode frequencies can be obtained the natural frequency is normalized and the data normalization is carried out by using the ratio of the natural frequency change 12 y 1 j δ ω 1 δ ω j j 2 5 y max max y 1 j y 12 y 12 y max y 13 y 13 y max y 14 y 14 y max y 15 y 15 y max where δ ω 1 is the variation of the first order frequency δ ω j is the variation of the j th order frequency 3 1 3 bp neural network model for damage identification of ship structure bp neural network is widely used in damage identification it has the following advantages for ship damage identification bp neural network can carry out pattern recognition without prior knowledge requirement of damage mechanism and control equation moreover bp neural network has excellent robustness to the natural frequency data in spite of uncertain external factor such as noise which may lead to the error of frequency bp neural network based process of damage identification of the ship structure is shown in fig 1 at the same time according to the change of ship frequency characteristics the sigmoid transfer function and the lm algorithm is selected xie 2018 3 2 method based on mode shape compared with the method based on natural frequency the change of mode shapes before and after damage is extremely small especially for large structures like ship girder the following text gives the damage indicators better to identify the damage 3 2 1 mode shape based damage identification theory there is an exact correspondence between modal shapes and geometric characteristics of ship structure so scholars have conducted relevant researches based on modal shape fan and qiao 2011 lestari et al 2007 adewuyi et al 2009 ciambella et al 2019 lestari lestari et al 2007 gives the governing equation of cantilever beam structure under damage condition 13 13 2 x 2 e i d x 2 ϕ d i x x 2 ρ x λ i ϕ d i x 0 e i d x e i h 1 ε h x x 1 h x x 2 where e i d x is the stiffness under damaged condition e i h is the structural stiffness under healthy condition ε is the degree of damage ε 1 h x x i i 1 2 is the heaviside step function reflecting the damage location perturbation theory nayfeh 1973 is used to obtain the solution of the governing equation under damaged condition 14 14 ϕ d i x ϕ 0 i x ε ϕ 1 i x ε 2 ϕ 2 i x where ϕ 0 i x is the solution under healthy condition and ϕ 1 i x ϕ 2 i x are the functions to be determined in the process of solving the equation compared with the analytical solution of the intact cantilever beam the derivative of maximum value of the difference δ ϕ max is found to have the ability to locate the damage which means that the difference value of modal curvature can be used as an index to identify the damage we simplify the ship structure as a hull girder model the hull girder is discretized into a slender beam structure with 20 units with the same length this paper will mainly elaborate the particularity of the damage identification of hull girder with free boundary condition the stiffness change caused by damage is considered and the mass change is ignored for ship structure comac and modal curvature indexes are adopted to deal with minor variations of mode shapes to improve the accuracy of identification 3 2 2 comac comac is expressed as formula 15 15 c o m a c r 1 n φ r u i φ r d i 2 r 1 n φ r u 2 i r 1 n φ r d 2 i where n is the total number of modes φ r u i is the value of the i th nodal displacement of the r th mode under healthy condition φ r d i is the value of the i th nodal displacement of the r th mode under damaged condition comac is a dimensionless index representing the degree of correlation between two sets of vectors when comac equals to 1 it indicates that there is a complete correlation between the two groups of mode shapes which means that there exists no damage near the node when it equals to 0 it indicates that the two set of vectors are completely independent which means that there exists damage near the node in this paper comac are calculated by the first two the first three and the first four modes by ansys 3 2 3 modal curvature curvature is determined by the second derivative of mode shape when the hull girder is deformed structural stiffness will reduce when damage exists resulting in the change of modal curvature the calculation of i th modal curvature can be obtained by differentiating the mode shapes of the j th element 16 16 φ i x φ i j 1 2 φ i j φ i j 1 h 2 where h is the distance between two nodes the absolute value of modal curvature difference 17 is written as 17 δ φ x x φ d φ r the absolute value of modal curvature ratio 18 is written as 18 r φ d φ r φ d the position corresponding to maximum indicates the damage position flexible comparison of index changes in each position can help identify the damage more accurately 4 case analysis of damage identification of the hull girder in this paper a 1500 ton ship is selected as the research subject and its main scales is shown in table 1 the elastic modulus of the ship material is 206 gpa the poisson ratio is 0 3 and the density is 7800 kg m3 we use software matlab to calculate natural frequencies and train the bp neural network modal shapes are obtained by ansys 4 1 method based on the natural frequency the ship is divided into 20 segments and the length of per unit is 6m see fig 2 change the stiffness value of any unit of the ship to simulate the damage caused by weapons and the stiffness loss is used to represent the damage degree considering the common attack area and damage degree of the ship this paper sets up 98 kinds of ship damage conditions units from 4 to 17 are simulated to suffer different degrees of damage the explosion damage leads to the stiffness loss of 3 5 10 18 30 40 and 45 and 98 kinds of conditions are used as the training sample library of bp neural network a total of 33 cases are used as the test cases for the trained bp network see fig 3 4 1 1 analysis of natural frequency database natural frequencies of the first five order of the ship are obtained respectively by the migration matrix method see figss 4 8 for each order frequency the frequency decreases with the increase of the damage degree in the same damage position the change is positively correlated with the degree of damage of the ship when damage degree is certain the curve of the first order natural frequency shows a decreasing trend as the damaged area goes from the bow to the middle of the ship and then shows an increasing trend see fig 4 the position corresponding to the maximum value of the natural frequency change is in the middle of the ship so that the first order of the natural frequency can be used to reflect the damage in the midship for the second to fifth order frequency the frequency fluctuates along the longitudinal direction of the ship taking unit 7 unit10 unit 12 and unit 16 as examples normalized data is shown in figs 9 12 the change ratio is consistent for the damage at the same area regardless of the damage degree which indicates that the change ratio of any two modes is only related to the damage position 4 1 2 damage identification based on bp neural network method the bp neural network is an algorithm for error back propagation training with a multi layer network structure which learns the use of the steepest descent method it can simulate the human brain s thinking mode to learn some data and then adjust the parameters to make the prediction model achieve higher precision the network connection weight coefficients and thresholds are automatically adjusted by the back propagation of the output error thereby minimizing the error value of the network to achieve the desired error in this study the network has a three layer network structure consisting of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer each composed of a plurality of neurons that can be calculated in parallel the connection between the hidden layer and the input layer are connected by an activation function for example in the case where the input layer is 4 the relationship between a certain neuron n of the hidden layer and the input layer data can be characterized by the following formula 19 f n i 1 4 w n i x i where n is a neuron in the hidden layer and i is the number of input layers at the same time the output layer and the hidden layer are also connected by an indeterminate activation function the topology used in this experiment is shown in fig 13 we choose the four frequency based parameters as the input the damage location and damage quantification are selected as the two outputs the arrows indicate the corresponding relationship building the bp neural network hadjileontiadis et al 2005 and using a multi layer feedforward network based on differential inverse propagation algorithm to construct a three layer network namely input layer output layer and hidden layer according to the loading characteristics of the hull girder the vertical bending moment is the greatest near the midship section hull girder may be broken off in case of damage near midship therefore this paper chooses the damaged unit unit 7 and unit 15 near midship to simulate the dangerous damage condition which may cause the ship to sink the network consists of 4 input layer nodes and 2 output layer nodes to locate and quantify the damage the number of hidden layer nodes is determined by the actual training test to 9 see fig 13 table 2 shows the six cases set up for inspection and table 3 shows the natural frequencies obtained by ansys the error of the network is set to 0 00001 and the training times are set to 99999 the learning rate is set to 0 2 results show that the average accuracy of the localization recognition is 100 and the errors of the quantification are shown in fig 14 the maximum error is 7 93 and the minimum is 0 14 the average error is 4 22 which shows that the intelligent method based on neural network can accurately locate and quantify the damage 4 1 3 conclusions of natural frequency based method from the identification results it is feasible to predict the ship damage based on the natural frequency change before and after the ship explosion damage bp neural network based method can provide reference for the ship damage identification taking 1500 tons of ships as example all the position of ship damage is correctly found and the average accuracy of damage degree reaches 95 78 it can be seen that bp neural network is effective for the training of the natural frequency database of the damaged ship the intrinsic mapping relationship created by the bp neural network can accurately obtain the damage condition of the hull girder compared with the field survey to find and quantify the damage in practical engineering this method is more efficient and accurate to obtain the damage condition of the structure 4 2 method based on mode shape 4 2 1 acquire the mode shape of the ship the modal shapes of the hull girder are obtained by ansys and the hull parameters are given in table 1 the hull is equivalent to 20 cuboid units along the longitudinal direction including 21 nodes and the length of each unit is 6m setting the elastic modulus to 2 06 e 11 pa density to 7800 kg m3 poisson ratio to 0 3 and boundary condition to the free boundary condition the numerical model and damage identification process are shown in fig 15 5 results the mode shapes are calculated by ansys the results of comac fig 16 fig 17 δ φ x x fig 18 fig 19 and r fig 20 fig 21 obtained are shown in the figures below it can be seen from the figure that for the damage of the two units set in this paper the index comac has an increasingly obvious effect on location identification with more modes used for calculation which means that comac with high order modes has an obvious ability to locate the damage however it cannot accurately identify the specific unit where damage exists the location error is mostly within 6m comac has a negative correlation with the damage degree it can be seen that with the increase of the damage degree comac gradually decreases but it is not very differentiated in terms of numerical magnitude comac cannot accurately reflect the true damage degree of the structure compared with the damage identification results of comac modal curvature can identify the damage with higher accuracy and stability figs 20 and 21 show the index changes of modal curvature difference figs 18 and 19 in the damaged area the index δ φ x x of each mode is obviously larger than that of the surrounding undamaged area in fig 18a b and c it can be clearly seen that δ φ x x of the 2nd and 4th mode accurately locate the damage although δ φ x x of the 3rd and 4th mode at the damage unit increases obviously there are still some possible units leading to misidentification for the accurately locating the damage however in fig 19 a b and c δ φ x x of the 1st mode locates the damage accurately whereas the other modes fail the calculation results of the index r are shown in figs 20 and 21 similar with the effect of modal curvature difference index errors occur when the index is used to identify the damage see fig 20a and b however in fig 21 the index of the first mode locates the damaged unit efficiently and clearly that is to say the index r has the ability to realize damage localization but error will occur when we use alone small amounts of data to some extent the above two indexes based on modal curvature can realize damage localization from the overall trend however in view of the errors of δ φ x x and r calculated by single mode in the identification of damage location this paper averages the index results are shown in fig 22 the mean value of δ φ x x accurately locates the damaged unit while the mean value of r locates the wrong unit 7 fig 22c shows that it wrongly locates the unit 10 however the index value corresponding to unit 7 of this figure simultaneously also shows a small peak value combined with fig 20 it can be seen that the identification error of r of the second mode directly causes this positioning error 6 conclusion of results based on mode shape in this paper comac modal curvature difference modal curvature ratio and their mean values are used to identify the damage of hull girder based on mode shape method the results show that the indexes above call for less data than the natural frequency based method and have higher computational efficiency in terms of damage location comac has a large positioning error and poor effect modal curvature index is more accurate for damage location and precisely locating the damage with this index requires the combination of more modes 7 conclusions and future study in this paper from the perspective of the inverse problem the ship damage is identified by the dynamic characteristic parameters natural frequency or modal shape migration matrix method is introduced to obtain the damage database and bp neural network is used to train the database then the accuracy and stability of locating and quantifying the damage are studied by the testing cases results show that using neural network method can accurately identify both the damage location and the damage degree however this method also has disadvantages the main reason is that the database cannot accurately correspond to the real ship so high precision modeling is of vital importance for this work in the method of mode shape comac modal curvature and its derivatives are adopted to identify the damage of the hull girder results show that comac is not suitable for the damage identification of the hull girder with free boundary condition because of its inaccuracy and instability modal curvature and its derivative indicators need to be used with the data of various modes so as to identify the damage more accurately however the indicators cannot reflect the actual damage degree future study will focus on improving the accuracy of locating the damage with limited modal shape data moreover the quantitative research of ship damage should be carried out based on modal shapes author contribution statement yin zhang development or design of methodology creation of

22108,considering the limitation of current direct measurement method for ship damage identification an indirect damage identification method based on dynamic parameters is taken into account a 1500 ton ship simplified as the hull girder is taken as the research object artificial neural network method the coordinate modal confidence comac and modal curvature index are applied to identify the ship s damage under different conditions through numerical experiments migration matrix method is introduced to obtain the damage database the damage identification accuracy of two indexes based on modal

the average accuracy of damage severity reached 95 78 for damage indexes based on modal shapes comac requires less data to identify the damage and has high calculation efficiency but there is a certain range of error when used in conjunction with various modes of the index modal curvature damage localization is relatively accurate both indicators based on modal shapes can reflect the damage degree to some extent but can t accurately identify the specific extent of damage keywords damage detection on ship dynamic parameters bp neural network comac modal curvature 1 introductions with the development of sophisticated weapons in the maritime powers the location and degree of damage caused by various types of weapons to ship in combat have a very important meaning for a ship to continue to fight different from structural health monitoring in civil engineering and the identification of damage in aerospace engineering the explosion damage of the ship is instantaneous which means that there are few effective signals used to analyze the dynamic response of the structure for explosion damage identification the selection of dynamic characteristics analyzed from the special signals is of vital importance most of the researches are mainly aimed at the direct problems of ship structure martin and j sinclair 2012 mckown et al 2008 m zhang et al 2012 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2017 that is to solve the whole or local response of ships with the known input and system of the ship structure such as impact spectrum guo et al 2019 impact environment guo et al 2017 2019 and the studies of vibration and noise reduction explosion tests on real ships are more concerned with the macroscopic response of the structure itself while ignoring microscopic changes of the structure the microscopic structural changes of the ship can be available with the known input and response which is the inverse problem for ship research structural changes caused by the explosion damage usually give rise to the changes of quality stiffness and energy dissipation characteristics of the structure which provides a theoretical basis for ship explosion damage identification based on structural dynamic characteristics in the aspect of damage identification of beam structure different methods have been applied to identify the damage yoon and heider 2009 elshamy et al 2018 hadjileontiadis et al 2005 ciambella et al 2017 which has the possibility of mutual reference for the study of ship damage identification in engineering applications koh b h koh and dyke 2007 proposed a damage identification method for cable stayed bridges based on modal assurance criteria xu xu et al 2011 and other scholars developed the method based on modal strain energy to realize the damage identification of the finite element model of the cable stayed bridge by training the different damage cases of a truss structure through artificial intelligence method and using the modal strain energy method ramin ghiasi ghiasi et al 2018 identified the damage and compared the accuracy behmanesh iman behmanesh et al 2017 used finite element model data to identify the probability of the building and then verified the effectiveness of the model mangal l mangal et al 2001 studied the parameters of the damage of the jacket offshore platform and the process is carried out by using the neural network to identify the pulse excitation load and the vibration response of the jacket offshore platform model results showed good damage recognition effect prashant m pawar pawar et al 2007 took fourier coefficients as input parameter and used neural network method to train parameters to locate and quantify the damage results showed that the method based on fourier coefficients and neural network could accurately identify the beam structure damage tianxiang huang huang et al 2018 developed a baseline free damage location procedure based on the nodal displacement of structural modal shapes to measure the damage of a steel beam and the result was validated with an analytical model a numerical model and experiments ahmet can altunisik altunisik et al 2017 calculated and measured the natural frequencies and mode shapes for undamaged and multiple cracked cantilever beams modal assurance criterion mac and coordinated modal assurance criterion comac factors are obtained from the mode shapes and the correlation between the measured and calculated values for damaged location identification was established j ciambella ciambella and vestroni 2015 developed a filter algorithm to localize the beam type structure damages with the method of perturbative solution based on euler bernoulli equation in the above researches the method of damage identification using natural frequency is universal and general methods based on artificial neural network are widely applied to extract the intrinsic relationship between frequency and damage further constructing the function mapping relationship by training the data is of great significance for the research of the detection of ship damage for modal shape based damage identification particularity arises for ship structure studied in this paper among some researches many of the objects studied are models of small scale and models are mostly the form of simply supported beam or cantilever beam for large scale model with free boundary condition the particularity of various damage indicators based on modal shape method is discussed in this paper methods based on natural frequency and modal shapes to identify the damage are studied using neural network comac and modal curvature migration matrix method is used to obtain the natural frequencies to establish the database and then bp neural network is applied to train the database modal shapes are obtained by ansys the method based on natural frequency for damage identification is more efficient and accurate but it is necessary to establish a database containing enough damage cases however the method based on mode shape does not need to establish the database there is a correspondence between mode shape and geometric position information of the structure which can be used to realize damage identification of the structure the applicability stability and accuracy of the two dynamic parameters based methods in the hull girder model application were discussed two different methods are compared and analyzed so as to provide reference for damage identification in real ship 2 theoretical hypothesis of ship explosion damage ship explosion damage usually results in the stiffness loss of the hull girder structural dynamic parameters natural frequency and modal shape etc are affected to different extent so that the ship structure shows difference of the dynamic response characteristics from the intact structure liu 2017 when the ship is damaged by an external weapon the damage can lead to a small change in the quality of the hull which is negligible compared with the quality of the whole ship however the local stiffness of the ship will then change greatly which can cause the change of its dynamic parameters in this paper the ship explosion damage is simulated by changing the stiffness the damage degree is expressed by the amount of stiffness loss and is determined by formula 1 1 k n α n k n where k n is the stiffness of the n th intact unit of the hull girder k n is the stiffness of the n th damaged unit α n is the damage degree of the n th unit 3 ship damage identification methods natural frequencies and modal shapes are used to identify the damage according to the particularity of the damage identification of the hull girder the theory of ship explosion damage identification will be given as below 3 1 method based on the natural frequency 3 1 1 natural frequency based damage identification theory the natural frequency change sun 2016 caused by the stiffness loss can be expressed as 2 k δ k ω 2 δ ω 2 m x δ x 0 assuming that the mass stays the same after the damage and ignoring the second order items the natural frequency change is written as 3 δ w i 2 x i t δ k x i x i t m x i where k refers to the structural stiffness matrix δ k refers to the change in stiffness matrix m is the mass matrix ω refers to the natural frequency of the structure δ ω refers to the change in natural frequency x refers to the structural modal displacement δ x is the change of the structural mode displacement and i represents the i th mode when the ship is damaged both δ ω i and δ k are related to the damaged unit n 4 δ ω i f i δ k n formula 4 can be expanded by using the taylor s formula ignoring the higher order item formula 5 can be obtained 5 δ ω i f i 0 n δ k f i δ k 0 n when the ship has not been damaged at the damage position 6 f 0 n 0 then formula 5 can also be written as 7 δ ω i δ k h i n similarly the change in the natural frequency of the j th order δ ω j can be written as 8 δ ω j δ k h j n assuming that the change of ship stiffness is independent of natural frequency from 7 8 we obtain 9 δ ω i δ ω j h i n h j n h n therefore the change ratio of the natural frequency of any two modes in the damaged condition is only related to the damage position n however the same change in natural frequency may occur in spite of different damage conditions so it is difficult to accurately judge the damage condition only from the change of the natural frequency of by using only one mode the integrated use of the appropriate number of modes will help determine the uniqueness of the changes to accurately identify the damage in this paper natural frequencies of the first five modes are selected as the parameters for damage identification 3 1 2 damage identification parameters acquired by migration matrix method natural frequencies of the first five modes of the hull girder are obtained by the migration matrix method the hull girder is divided into 20 segments and the mass and stiffness are assumed to be evenly distributed on each segment see appendix for detailed derivation each segment has state vectors on its left and right end investigating the transfer and change of the state vectors through a beam section and joint the following equation 10 can be obtained 10 x 20 r s 1 s 2 s 3 s i s 20 x 1 l where x i is the state vector of the i th unit s i is the inter span matrix the boundary conditions of the two free ends of the hull girder are given as 11 m 1 r f 1 r 0 m 20 l f 20 l 0 returning formula 11 to formula 10 the first five mode frequencies can be obtained the natural frequency is normalized and the data normalization is carried out by using the ratio of the natural frequency change 12 y 1 j δ ω 1 δ ω j j 2 5 y max max y 1 j y 12 y 12 y max y 13 y 13 y max y 14 y 14 y max y 15 y 15 y max where δ ω 1 is the variation of the first order frequency δ ω j is the variation of the j th order frequency 3 1 3 bp neural network model for damage identification of ship structure bp neural network is widely used in damage identification it has the following advantages for ship damage identification bp neural network can carry out pattern recognition without prior knowledge requirement of damage mechanism and control equation moreover bp neural network has excellent robustness to the natural frequency data in spite of uncertain external factor such as noise which may lead to the error of frequency bp neural network based process of damage identification of the ship structure is shown in fig 1 at the same time according to the change of ship frequency characteristics the sigmoid transfer function and the lm algorithm is selected xie 2018 3 2 method based on mode shape compared with the method based on natural frequency the change of mode shapes before and after damage is extremely small especially for large structures like ship girder the following text gives the damage indicators better to identify the damage 3 2 1 mode shape based damage identification theory there is an exact correspondence between modal shapes and geometric characteristics of ship structure so scholars have conducted relevant researches based on modal shape fan and qiao 2011 lestari et al 2007 adewuyi et al 2009 ciambella et al 2019 lestari lestari et al 2007 gives the governing equation of cantilever beam structure under damage condition 13 13 2 x 2 e i d x 2 ϕ d i x x 2 ρ x λ i ϕ d i x 0 e i d x e i h 1 ε h x x 1 h x x 2 where e i d x is the stiffness under damaged condition e i h is the structural stiffness under healthy condition ε is the degree of damage ε 1 h x x i i 1 2 is the heaviside step function reflecting the damage location perturbation theory nayfeh 1973 is used to obtain the solution of the governing equation under damaged condition 14 14 ϕ d i x ϕ 0 i x ε ϕ 1 i x ε 2 ϕ 2 i x where ϕ 0 i x is the solution under healthy condition and ϕ 1 i x ϕ 2 i x are the functions to be determined in the process of solving the equation compared with the analytical solution of the intact cantilever beam the derivative of maximum value of the difference δ ϕ max is found to have the ability to locate the damage which means that the difference value of modal curvature can be used as an index to identify the damage we simplify the ship structure as a hull girder model the hull girder is discretized into a slender beam structure with 20 units with the same length this paper will mainly elaborate the particularity of the damage identification of hull girder with free boundary condition the stiffness change caused by damage is considered and the mass change is ignored for ship structure comac and modal curvature indexes are adopted to deal with minor variations of mode shapes to improve the accuracy of identification 3 2 2 comac comac is expressed as formula 15 15 c o m a c r 1 n φ r u i φ r d i 2 r 1 n φ r u 2 i r 1 n φ r d 2 i where n is the total number of modes φ r u i is the value of the i th nodal displacement of the r th mode under healthy condition φ r d i is the value of the i th nodal displacement of the r th mode under damaged condition comac is a dimensionless index representing the degree of correlation between two sets of vectors when comac equals to 1 it indicates that there is a complete correlation between the two groups of mode shapes which means that there exists no damage near the node when it equals to 0 it indicates that the two set of vectors are completely independent which means that there exists damage near the node in this paper comac are calculated by the first two the first three and the first four modes by ansys 3 2 3 modal curvature curvature is determined by the second derivative of mode shape when the hull girder is deformed structural stiffness will reduce when damage exists resulting in the change of modal curvature the calculation of i th modal curvature can be obtained by differentiating the mode shapes of the j th element 16 16 φ i x φ i j 1 2 φ i j φ i j 1 h 2 where h is the distance between two nodes the absolute value of modal curvature difference 17 is written as 17 δ φ x x φ d φ r the absolute value of modal curvature ratio 18 is written as 18 r φ d φ r φ d the position corresponding to maximum indicates the damage position flexible comparison of index changes in each position can help identify the damage more accurately 4 case analysis of damage identification of the hull girder in this paper a 1500 ton ship is selected as the research subject and its main scales is shown in table 1 the elastic modulus of the ship material is 206 gpa the poisson ratio is 0 3 and the density is 7800 kg m3 we use software matlab to calculate natural frequencies and train the bp neural network modal shapes are obtained by ansys 4 1 method based on the natural frequency the ship is divided into 20 segments and the length of per unit is 6m see fig 2 change the stiffness value of any unit of the ship to simulate the damage caused by weapons and the stiffness loss is used to represent the damage degree considering the common attack area and damage degree of the ship this paper sets up 98 kinds of ship damage conditions units from 4 to 17 are simulated to suffer different degrees of damage the explosion damage leads to the stiffness loss of 3 5 10 18 30 40 and 45 and 98 kinds of conditions are used as the training sample library of bp neural network a total of 33 cases are used as the test cases for the trained bp network see fig 3 4 1 1 analysis of natural frequency database natural frequencies of the first five order of the ship are obtained respectively by the migration matrix method see figss 4 8 for each order frequency the frequency decreases with the increase of the damage degree in the same damage position the change is positively correlated with the degree of damage of the ship when damage degree is certain the curve of the first order natural frequency shows a decreasing trend as the damaged area goes from the bow to the middle of the ship and then shows an increasing trend see fig 4 the position corresponding to the maximum value of the natural frequency change is in the middle of the ship so that the first order of the natural frequency can be used to reflect the damage in the midship for the second to fifth order frequency the frequency fluctuates along the longitudinal direction of the ship taking unit 7 unit10 unit 12 and unit 16 as examples normalized data is shown in figs 9 12 the change ratio is consistent for the damage at the same area regardless of the damage degree which indicates that the change ratio of any two modes is only related to the damage position 4 1 2 damage identification based on bp neural network method the bp neural network is an algorithm for error back propagation training with a multi layer network structure which learns the use of the steepest descent method it can simulate the human brain s thinking mode to learn some data and then adjust the parameters to make the prediction model achieve higher precision the network connection weight coefficients and thresholds are automatically adjusted by the back propagation of the output error thereby minimizing the error value of the network to achieve the desired error in this study the network has a three layer network structure consisting of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer each composed of a plurality of neurons that can be calculated in parallel the connection between the hidden layer and the input layer are connected by an activation function for example in the case where the input layer is 4 the relationship between a certain neuron n of the hidden layer and the input layer data can be characterized by the following formula 19 f n i 1 4 w n i x i where n is a neuron in the hidden layer and i is the number of input layers at the same time the output layer and the hidden layer are also connected by an indeterminate activation function the topology used in this experiment is shown in fig 13 we choose the four frequency based parameters as the input the damage location and damage quantification are selected as the two outputs the arrows indicate the corresponding relationship building the bp neural network hadjileontiadis et al 2005 and using a multi layer feedforward network based on differential inverse propagation algorithm to construct a three layer network namely input layer output layer and hidden layer according to the loading characteristics of the hull girder the vertical bending moment is the greatest near the midship section hull girder may be broken off in case of damage near midship therefore this paper chooses the damaged unit unit 7 and unit 15 near midship to simulate the dangerous damage condition which may cause the ship to sink the network consists of 4 input layer nodes and 2 output layer nodes to locate and quantify the damage the number of hidden layer nodes is determined by the actual training test to 9 see fig 13 table 2 shows the six cases set up for inspection and table 3 shows the natural frequencies obtained by ansys the error of the network is set to 0 00001 and the training times are set to 99999 the learning rate is set to 0 2 results show that the average accuracy of the localization recognition is 100 and the errors of the quantification are shown in fig 14 the maximum error is 7 93 and the minimum is 0 14 the average error is 4 22 which shows that the intelligent method based on neural network can accurately locate and quantify the damage 4 1 3 conclusions of natural frequency based method from the identification results it is feasible to predict the ship damage based on the natural frequency change before and after the ship explosion damage bp neural network based method can provide reference for the ship damage identification taking 1500 tons of ships as example all the position of ship damage is correctly found and the average accuracy of damage degree reaches 95 78 it can be seen that bp neural network is effective for the training of the natural frequency database of the damaged ship the intrinsic mapping relationship created by the bp neural network can accurately obtain the damage condition of the hull girder compared with the field survey to find and quantify the damage in practical engineering this method is more efficient and accurate to obtain the damage condition of the structure 4 2 method based on mode shape 4 2 1 acquire the mode shape of the ship the modal shapes of the hull girder are obtained by ansys and the hull parameters are given in table 1 the hull is equivalent to 20 cuboid units along the longitudinal direction including 21 nodes and the length of each unit is 6m setting the elastic modulus to 2 06 e 11 pa density to 7800 kg m3 poisson ratio to 0 3 and boundary condition to the free boundary condition the numerical model and damage identification process are shown in fig 15 5 results the mode shapes are calculated by ansys the results of comac fig 16 fig 17 δ φ x x fig 18 fig 19 and r fig 20 fig 21 obtained are shown in the figures below it can be seen from the figure that for the damage of the two units set in this paper the index comac has an increasingly obvious effect on location identification with more modes used for calculation which means that comac with high order modes has an obvious ability to locate the damage however it cannot accurately identify the specific unit where damage exists the location error is mostly within 6m comac has a negative correlation with the damage degree it can be seen that with the increase of the damage degree comac gradually decreases but it is not very differentiated in terms of numerical magnitude comac cannot accurately reflect the true damage degree of the structure compared with the damage identification results of comac modal curvature can identify the damage with higher accuracy and stability figs 20 and 21 show the index changes of modal curvature difference figs 18 and 19 in the damaged area the index δ φ x x of each mode is obviously larger than that of the surrounding undamaged area in fig 18a b and c it can be clearly seen that δ φ x x of the 2nd and 4th mode accurately locate the damage although δ φ x x of the 3rd and 4th mode at the damage unit increases obviously there are still some possible units leading to misidentification for the accurately locating the damage however in fig 19 a b and c δ φ x x of the 1st mode locates the damage accurately whereas the other modes fail the calculation results of the index r are shown in figs 20 and 21 similar with the effect of modal curvature difference index errors occur when the index is used to identify the damage see fig 20a and b however in fig 21 the index of the first mode locates the damaged unit efficiently and clearly that is to say the index r has the ability to realize damage localization but error will occur when we use alone small amounts of data to some extent the above two indexes based on modal curvature can realize damage localization from the overall trend however in view of the errors of δ φ x x and r calculated by single mode in the identification of damage location this paper averages the index results are shown in fig 22 the mean value of δ φ x x accurately locates the damaged unit while the mean value of r locates the wrong unit 7 fig 22c shows that it wrongly locates the unit 10 however the index value corresponding to unit 7 of this figure simultaneously also shows a small peak value combined with fig 20 it can be seen that the identification error of r of the second mode directly causes this positioning error 6 conclusion of results based on mode shape in this paper comac modal curvature difference modal curvature ratio and their mean values are used to identify the damage of hull girder based on mode shape method the results show that the indexes above call for less data than the natural frequency based method and have higher computational efficiency in terms of damage location comac has a large positioning error and poor effect modal curvature index is more accurate for damage location and precisely locating the damage with this index requires the combination of more modes 7 conclusions and future study in this paper from the perspective of the inverse problem the ship damage is identified by the dynamic characteristic parameters natural frequency or modal shape migration matrix method is introduced to obtain the damage database and bp neural network is used to train the database then the accuracy and stability of locating and quantifying the damage are studied by the testing cases results show that using neural network method can accurately identify both the damage location and the damage degree however this method also has disadvantages the main reason is that the database cannot accurately correspond to the real ship so high precision modeling is of vital importance for this work in the method of mode shape comac modal curvature and its derivatives are adopted to identify the damage of the hull girder results show that comac is not suitable for the damage identification of the hull girder with free boundary condition because of its inaccuracy and instability modal curvature and its derivative indicators need to be used with the data of various modes so as to identify the damage more accurately however the indicators cannot reflect the actual damage degree future study will focus on improving the accuracy of locating the damage with limited modal shape data moreover the quantitative research of ship damage should be carried out based on modal shapes author contribution statement yin zhang development or design of methodology creation of

22109,tide is an essential factor in coastal engineering the relationship between all forces and factors causing tides are very complex traditionally tides are predicted through harmonic analysis where a tide level at any time instants is estimated based on the past records predicting tide levels based on previously recorded data strongly suits the application of artificial intelligence models such as neural networks in the literature the tide level estimation with neural networks has been mostly considered as a curve fitting problem as such for different beaches different networks have been designed and used contrary in this article a simple and efficient deep neural network that can estimate future tide levels based on forces and factors affecting the tidal range is proposed the main advantages of the proposed method are that the input layer can be kept as small as possible the input data is accessible and as the input data is based on the main causes of tide one network can be used for different beaches keywords artificial intelligence astronomical forces deep learning tides tidal range 1 introduction tide is an essential factor in coastal engineering and it is important to estimate tidal levels with a high degree of accuracy at all times this is due to the fact that in addition to their effects on beach profiles riazi and türker 2017 the tidal range have significant impact on ocean waves coastal aquifers offshore constructions and sediment transportation chang and lin 2006 lee 2004 lee and jeng 2002 tides can also affect animals lives i e marsh birds and clapper rails lehmicke et al 2013 zembal and massey 1987 tides have been studied comprehensively and due to their importance different models and approaches for estimating tidal range have been proposed cai et al 2018 darwin 1892 doodson 1958 gelb 1974 kalman 1960 mizumura 1984 yen et al 1996 in general tides are predicted through harmonic analysis in the classical harmonic analysis the tidal height at time t h t is estimated based on known tidal constituent frequencies ω lee 2004 leffler and jay 2009 as 1 h t a 0 i 1 n a i c o s ω i t b i s i n ω i t where n is the total number of constituents a i and b i are the coefficients of constituents classic harmonic analysis has several drawbacks and is strongly affected by environmental noises leffler and jay 2009 pawlowicz et al 2002 the relationship between all forces and factors causing tides are very complex chang and lin 2006 therefore similar to harmonic analysis the tide levels at any time instants are normally estimated based on the past records which strongly satisfies the application of artificial intelligence ai models such as neural networks nn the importance of nn in predicting tide levels has been noticed and reported in the literature chang and lin 2006 deo and chaudhari 1998 lee 2004 lee and jeng 2002 zhang et al 2018 the tide level estimations has been improved given and through the power of ai predicting tide level through nn as reported in the literature can be divided into two categories in the first category nn is designed in such a way that the input layer is the previous tidal data i e tidal constituents obtained from harmonic analysis or simply the exact tidal range and based on the input data the next tide level is estimated deo and chaudhari 1998 lee 2004 lee jeng 2002 zhang et al 2018 in cases where the nn predicts the future tide levels based on previous tides information the number of neurons in the input layer are significantly important the predictions of the nn can only be improved by increasing the number of neurons in the input layer however this will increase the optimization time and moreover it can cause overfitting lee and jeng 2002 beside the mentioned disadvantage predicting tide levels based on previous tides data can be considered as a simple curve fitting problem where nn independent of the tide characteristics tries to find the best curve that fits the employed data fig 1 nn application in curve fitting is well recognized and it has a high degree of accuracy specht 1991 in the second category in a more advanced approach chang and lin 2006 have developed their nn structure based on comprehensive tide generating forces with an input layer based on a 2 hour lead time that can be compared with a harmonic method with 60 constituents the advantage of this method is that the nn is designed based on the affective forces however similar to harmonic method it uses previous tide information of a location to predict next tidal level moreover the main limitation of both categories is that for each beach a separate nn should be designed to overcome the mentioned issues this study addresses a simple and efficient nn that can be used to estimate future tide levels the main advantages of the proposed method are that the input layer has been kept as small as possible the input data is accessible and easy to obtain and as the input data is based on the main causes of tide one nn can be used for different beaches 2 study area and data the data used in this study were obtained from open data section of queensland government maritime and safety queensland website retrieved from https www msq qld gov au tides open data in this study six stations were considered fig 2 as the data prior to 2016 was provided in hourly intervals the database is constructed based on hourly average sea levels to avoid negative signs for the water level i e when the sea level is below the datum in the constructed database 10 cm maximum negative value available in the dataset has been added to all water level records a summary of the data employed in this study is provided in table 1 all the six stations mentioned in table 1 share similar astronomical forces although tide generating forces are the main causes of tides tides are significantly affected by the geology geomorphology and biology of a coast as well kvale 2006 as it can be seen in fig 3 tide level records in these stations have noticeable different frequency and amplitude 3 methodology in this study the main causes of tides are considered as the input neurons one of the main tide generating forces is moon s gravitational force brier and bradley 1964 in a lunar month when moon moves from a new moon to the next new moon full moon will occur full moon is when earth is located between the sun and the moon causing a fully illuminated moon the new moon refers to the time when sun is behind the moon and there is no reflecting light meeus 1991 due to their similar position with respect to earth the new and the full moon have similar effects on tides where mostly it can be seen as spring tides therefore in the interest of normalization the moon position is normalized with respect to the time interval of a new moon to a full moon half of a lunar month by considering the maximum half of a lunar month to be equal to 22 459 0 min the moon position in each lunar month is normalized as 2 n o r m a l i z e d m o o n p o s i t i o n m p 22459 where moon position mp is the minutes passed in a lunar month based on the local time and is reset to zero in occurrence of a new or a full moon in result the magnitude of normalized moon position will always be within the interval of 0 1 where numbers close to 0 or 1 indicates the new or full moon in a lunar month as the effect of new and full moon on tides are considered to be similar gaussian activation function has been employed to best describe this cycle fig 4 3 f x e x b 2 2 c 2 where here b 0 5 so the position of the center of the peak of the gaussian activation function will represent the first or third quarter of the moon to have a wider range of values for f herein 2c 2 is considered to be equal to 0 10 the other two main tide generating forces are the gravitational attraction between the earth and the sun and the rotation of earth over its own axes chang and lin 2006 lee 2004 earth s orbit around the sun in ecliptic and seasons on earth occur because its axis of rotation is tilted strahler and strahler 2006 these behaviors are periodic and can be simulated as sawtooth wave to normalize the earth position with respect to sun the instant local time is divided by one year as all the calculations are based on minutes a leap year is considered as 366 24 60 527 040 0 min and a normal year is considered as 365 24 60 525 600 0 min thus the rotation of earth around sun is normalized as 4 e a r t h p o s i t i o n c t 527040 l e a p y e a r c t 525600 n o r m a l y e a r where ct is the minutes passed in a year starting from the first day of the first month at time 00 00 for instance for 1st of february ct 44 640 0 min by considering each day as 24 h the earth rotation can simply be normalized as 5 e a r t h r o t a t i o n c p 1440 where cp is the amount of minutes passed from clock 00 00 for each day moreover coastlines can reflect tidal waves to make actual tides in a specific area higher or lower than expected by the astronomical forces chang and lin 2006 as it can be seen in fig 3 the effect of geology geomorphology and biology factors on tidal levels are significant although for the study area the astronomical forces i e moon position earth position with respect to sun and its own axes are the same the difference in tidal levels are noteworthy therefore in the designed deep neural network for tide level predictions a new neuron for other factors than astronomical forces is considered in the interest of ai the new input neuron can be considered a dynamic bias that can adjust tide levels based on other factors other than astronomical forces fig 5 the term dynamic bias has been adopted as the value of this neuron can be changed with respect to the location of each station the number of neurons are considered as small as possible to avoid overfitting the data although in the literature it has been reported that tides can be affected by the sea level rise pickering et al 2017 as it can be seen in fig 6 for the current study the effect of sea level rise on the maximum tide level is negligible finally the tide levels were normalized based on the maximum observed tidal range fig 6 as future tidal range are not available the maximum recorded tide level over 20 years 6 24 m was rounded up to 7 m and all tide levels were normalized as 6 n o r m a l i z e d t i d e l e v e l t l 7 where tl is the measured tide level 4 model optimization in the optimization process the available data was divided into two groups the first group contains data from 1996 up to 2016 that was used for training and validation of the network due to the periodic behavior of tides and to avoid overfitting of the model among the 1011918 available data from 1996 to 2016 only 12 9 130584 records were used for training and validation of the network where 93480 71 6 of the records were used for training and 37104 28 4 of the records were used for validation the second group contains all data from 2017 and was used as the test dataset to check the performance of the model to construct the training database only months with all data available were considered the training data was selected with priority of having a wide range of months covered in each year in the interest of tide frequency and amplitude similarity with respect to available data and based on fig 3 the tide records used in this study can be roughly divided into two groups where group one contains the tides recorded by cape ferguson bowen cardwell and cooktown stations and group two contains the tides recoded by karumba and thursday island stations in order to have uniform optimization equal number of tide records from each group has been selected for the training dataset to this end as it can be seen in tables 2 4 62 of the training data was selected from cape ferguson bowen cardwell cooktown stations and 4 62 was selected from karumba and thursday island stations in this research one of the aims was to obtain the geology geomorphology and biology factors related to each station relative to each other therefore the deep neural network presented in fig 5 required parallel optimization along with optimizing the network to find the best weights the geology geomorphology and biology neuron was optimized using genetic algorithm riazi and türker 2018 consequently along with optimized weights the best values representing the geology geomorphology and biology factors related to each station relative to each other were obtained in the process of optimization mean squared error mse was used as the error function 7 m s e 1 n i 0 n y i y ˆ i 2 where y i is the estimated normalized tide level and y ˆ i is the actual tide level at the time instance i the mse was calculated for each station separately to have a uniform optimization along all stations and to avoid over optimization towards one station the total mse was calculated as follows 8 t o t a l m s e j 1 6 m s e j 2 where m s e j is the mse of station j the aim of the optimization was to minimize the value of total mse equation 8 will guide the model in the direction of similar accuracy of tide prediction for all stations 5 results and discussions the geology geomorphology and biology factor of each station was obtained relative to each other with a novel method in the optimization process the stations were compared with each other and their geology geomorphology and biology factor was estimated table 3 the results obtained in table 3 are in line with figs 2 and 3 the geology geomorphology and biology values shown in table 3 adjusts the effect of astronomical forces on tides based on location as it was shown in fig 3 the tides recorded in bowen cape fergusin cardwell and cooktown stations share similar tide frequency and amplitude as a result the obtained bias values shown in table 3 for these stations are close to each other conversely the tide frequency and amplitude recorded in karumba and thursday island are clearly different as anticipated the obtained bias values for these stations are significantly different from other stations for instance one of the main reasons causing a noteworthy difference between the bias values related to karumba in comparison with other stations is that karumba station is within the norman river where other stations are located in an ocean among all the geology geomorphology and biology factors obtained in the optimization process the values related to cape ferguson and cardwell station are very close to each other which indicates the tide levels in these two stations must be very similar the obtained result is in line with the real tide levels recorded in these two stations and as it can be seen in fig 7 in january 2016 a randomly selected month the mean absolute tide level difference is just 14 6 cm the model performance was checked over the training validation and test dataset the high accuracy of the results as shown in table 4 and fig 8 indicates that the constructed deep neural network fig 5 is well designed optimized and reliable moreover as the difference between the average mae of all three datasets training validation and test is negligible it can be concluded that the model is not over fitted to the training data deep invistagtion on the results indicated that the highest errors were all related to the times that the stations faced abnormal water levels for intance the most intense error is related to the tide prediction for the date 03 02 2011 at 01 25 where the highest water level 6 24 m over the time period of 20 years was recoded fig 9 the time is exactly when north queensland experienced its largest and most powerful cyclone since 1918 tropical cyclone yasi with maximum recorded wind speed up to 185 km h cardwell was among the worst affected areas queensland government 2012 6 conclusions in this study a new deep neural network was proposed to predict a tide level at any time instance for different locations the network was designed based on four inputs 3 neurons for astronomical forces and 1 neuron for geology geomorphology and biology factors the proposed model was optimized over the data recorded from six stations in queensland australia with a novel method the geology geomorphology and biology factor of each station was obtained with respect to the tidal range of each location and relative to other stations the model performance was checked over the training validation and test dataset the high accuracy of the results indicated that the constructed deep neural network was well designed optimized and reliable one of the main advantages of the proposed method is its capability of estimating the tide level in different areas with high degree of accurately with an additional neuron in the input layer rather than having a new model for each location author contributions amin riazi conceived and designed the analysis collected the

22109,tide is an essential factor in coastal engineering the relationship between all forces and factors causing tides are very complex traditionally tides are predicted through harmonic analysis where a tide level at any time instants is estimated based on the past records predicting tide levels based on previously recorded data strongly suits the application of artificial intelligence models such as neural networks in the literature the tide level estimation with neural networks has been mostly considered as a curve fitting problem as such for different beaches different networks have been designed and used contrary in this article a simple and efficient deep neural network that can estimate future tide levels based on forces and factors affecting the tidal range is proposed the main advantages of the proposed method are that the input layer can be kept as small as possible the input data is accessible and as the input data is based on the main causes of tide one network can be used for different beaches keywords artificial intelligence astronomical forces deep learning tides tidal range 1 introduction tide is an essential factor in coastal engineering and it is important to estimate tidal levels with a high degree of accuracy at all times this is due to the fact that in addition to their effects on beach profiles riazi and türker 2017 the tidal range have significant impact on ocean waves coastal aquifers offshore constructions and sediment transportation chang and lin 2006 lee 2004 lee and jeng 2002 tides can also affect animals lives i e marsh birds and clapper rails lehmicke et al 2013 zembal and massey 1987 tides have been studied comprehensively and due to their importance different models and approaches for estimating tidal range have been proposed cai et al 2018 darwin 1892 doodson 1958 gelb 1974 kalman 1960 mizumura 1984 yen et al 1996 in general tides are predicted through harmonic analysis in the classical harmonic analysis the tidal height at time t h t is estimated based on known tidal constituent frequencies ω lee 2004 leffler and jay 2009 as 1 h t a 0 i 1 n a i c o s ω i t b i s i n ω i t where n is the total number of constituents a i and b i are the coefficients of constituents classic harmonic analysis has several drawbacks and is strongly affected by environmental noises leffler and jay 2009 pawlowicz et al 2002 the relationship between all forces and factors causing tides are very complex chang and lin 2006 therefore similar to harmonic analysis the tide levels at any time instants are normally estimated based on the past records which strongly satisfies the application of artificial intelligence ai models such as neural networks nn the importance of nn in predicting tide levels has been noticed and reported in the literature chang and lin 2006 deo and chaudhari 1998 lee 2004 lee and jeng 2002 zhang et al 2018 the tide level estimations has been improved given and through the power of ai predicting tide level through nn as reported in the literature can be divided into two categories in the first category nn is designed in such a way that the input layer is the previous tidal data i e tidal constituents obtained from harmonic analysis or simply the exact tidal range and based on the input data the next tide level is estimated deo and chaudhari 1998 lee 2004 lee jeng 2002 zhang et al 2018 in cases where the nn predicts the future tide levels based on previous tides information the number of neurons in the input layer are significantly important the predictions of the nn can only be improved by increasing the number of neurons in the input layer however this will increase the optimization time and moreover it can cause overfitting lee and jeng 2002 beside the mentioned disadvantage predicting tide levels based on previous tides data can be considered as a simple curve fitting problem where nn independent of the tide characteristics tries to find the best curve that fits the employed data fig 1 nn application in curve fitting is well recognized and it has a high degree of accuracy specht 1991 in the second category in a more advanced approach chang and lin 2006 have developed their nn structure based on comprehensive tide generating forces with an input layer based on a 2 hour lead time that can be compared with a harmonic method with 60 constituents the advantage of this method is that the nn is designed based on the affective forces however similar to harmonic method it uses previous tide information of a location to predict next tidal level moreover the main limitation of both categories is that for each beach a separate nn should be designed to overcome the mentioned issues this study addresses a simple and efficient nn that can be used to estimate future tide levels the main advantages of the proposed method are that the input layer has been kept as small as possible the input data is accessible and easy to obtain and as the input data is based on the main causes of tide one nn can be used for different beaches 2 study area and data the data used in this study were obtained from open data section of queensland government maritime and safety queensland website retrieved from https www msq qld gov au tides open data in this study six stations were considered fig 2 as the data prior to 2016 was provided in hourly intervals the database is constructed based on hourly average sea levels to avoid negative signs for the water level i e when the sea level is below the datum in the constructed database 10 cm maximum negative value available in the dataset has been added to all water level records a summary of the data employed in this study is provided in table 1 all the six stations mentioned in table 1 share similar astronomical forces although tide generating forces are the main causes of tides tides are significantly affected by the geology geomorphology and biology of a coast as well kvale 2006 as it can be seen in fig 3 tide level records in these stations have noticeable different frequency and amplitude 3 methodology in this study the main causes of tides are considered as the input neurons one of the main tide generating forces is moon s gravitational force brier and bradley 1964 in a lunar month when moon moves from a new moon to the next new moon full moon will occur full moon is when earth is located between the sun and the moon causing a fully illuminated moon the new moon refers to the time when sun is behind the moon and there is no reflecting light meeus 1991 due to their similar position with respect to earth the new and the full moon have similar effects on tides where mostly it can be seen as spring tides therefore in the interest of normalization the moon position is normalized with respect to the time interval of a new moon to a full moon half of a lunar month by considering the maximum half of a lunar month to be equal to 22 459 0 min the moon position in each lunar month is normalized as 2 n o r m a l i z e d m o o n p o s i t i o n m p 22459 where moon position mp is the minutes passed in a lunar month based on the local time and is reset to zero in occurrence of a new or a full moon in result the magnitude of normalized moon position will always be within the interval of 0 1 where numbers close to 0 or 1 indicates the new or full moon in a lunar month as the effect of new and full moon on tides are considered to be similar gaussian activation function has been employed to best describe this cycle fig 4 3 f x e x b 2 2 c 2 where here b 0 5 so the position of the center of the peak of the gaussian activation function will represent the first or third quarter of the moon to have a wider range of values for f herein 2c 2 is considered to be equal to 0 10 the other two main tide generating forces are the gravitational attraction between the earth and the sun and the rotation of earth over its own axes chang and lin 2006 lee 2004 earth s orbit around the sun in ecliptic and seasons on earth occur because its axis of rotation is tilted strahler and strahler 2006 these behaviors are periodic and can be simulated as sawtooth wave to normalize the earth position with respect to sun the instant local time is divided by one year as all the calculations are based on minutes a leap year is considered as 366 24 60 527 040 0 min and a normal year is considered as 365 24 60 525 600 0 min thus the rotation of earth around sun is normalized as 4 e a r t h p o s i t i o n c t 527040 l e a p y e a r c t 525600 n o r m a l y e a r where ct is the minutes passed in a year starting from the first day of the first month at time 00 00 for instance for 1st of february ct 44 640 0 min by considering each day as 24 h the earth rotation can simply be normalized as 5 e a r t h r o t a t i o n c p 1440 where cp is the amount of minutes passed from clock 00 00 for each day moreover coastlines can reflect tidal waves to make actual tides in a specific area higher or lower than expected by the astronomical forces chang and lin 2006 as it can be seen in fig 3 the effect of geology geomorphology and biology factors on tidal levels are significant although for the study area the astronomical forces i e moon position earth position with respect to sun and its own axes are the same the difference in tidal levels are noteworthy therefore in the designed deep neural network for tide level predictions a new neuron for other factors than astronomical forces is considered in the interest of ai the new input neuron can be considered a dynamic bias that can adjust tide levels based on other factors other than astronomical forces fig 5 the term dynamic bias has been adopted as the value of this neuron can be changed with respect to the location of each station the number of neurons are considered as small as possible to avoid overfitting the data although in the literature it has been reported that tides can be affected by the sea level rise pickering et al 2017 as it can be seen in fig 6 for the current study the effect of sea level rise on the maximum tide level is negligible finally the tide levels were normalized based on the maximum observed tidal range fig 6 as future tidal range are not available the maximum recorded tide level over 20 years 6 24 m was rounded up to 7 m and all tide levels were normalized as 6 n o r m a l i z e d t i d e l e v e l t l 7 where tl is the measured tide level 4 model optimization in the optimization process the available data was divided into two groups the first group contains data from 1996 up to 2016 that was used for training and validation of the network due to the periodic behavior of tides and to avoid overfitting of the model among the 1011918 available data from 1996 to 2016 only 12 9 130584 records were used for training and validation of the network where 93480 71 6 of the records were used for training and 37104 28 4 of the records were used for validation the second group contains all data from 2017 and was used as the test dataset to check the performance of the model to construct the training database only months with all data available were considered the training data was selected with priority of having a wide range of months covered in each year in the interest of tide frequency and amplitude similarity with respect to available data and based on fig 3 the tide records used in this study can be roughly divided into two groups where group one contains the tides recorded by cape ferguson bowen cardwell and cooktown stations and group two contains the tides recoded by karumba and thursday island stations in order to have uniform optimization equal number of tide records from each group has been selected for the training dataset to this end as it can be seen in tables 2 4 62 of the training data was selected from cape ferguson bowen cardwell cooktown stations and 4 62 was selected from karumba and thursday island stations in this research one of the aims was to obtain the geology geomorphology and biology factors related to each station relative to each other therefore the deep neural network presented in fig 5 required parallel optimization along with optimizing the network to find the best weights the geology geomorphology and biology neuron was optimized using genetic algorithm riazi and türker 2018 consequently along with optimized weights the best values representing the geology geomorphology and biology factors related to each station relative to each other were obtained in the process of optimization mean squared error mse was used as the error function 7 m s e 1 n i 0 n y i y ˆ i 2 where y i is the estimated normalized tide level and y ˆ i is the actual tide level at the time instance i the mse was calculated for each station separately to have a uniform optimization along all stations and to avoid over optimization towards one station the total mse was calculated as follows 8 t o t a l m s e j 1 6 m s e j 2 where m s e j is the mse of station j the aim of the optimization was to minimize the value of total mse equation 8 will guide the model in the direction of similar accuracy of tide prediction for all stations 5 results and discussions the geology geomorphology and biology factor of each station was obtained relative to each other with a novel method in the optimization process the stations were compared with each other and their geology geomorphology and biology factor was estimated table 3 the results obtained in table 3 are in line with figs 2 and 3 the geology geomorphology and biology values shown in table 3 adjusts the effect of astronomical forces on tides based on location as it was shown in fig 3 the tides recorded in bowen cape fergusin cardwell and cooktown stations share similar tide frequency and amplitude as a result the obtained bias values shown in table 3 for these stations are close to each other conversely the tide frequency and amplitude recorded in karumba and thursday island are clearly different as anticipated the obtained bias values for these stations are significantly different from other stations for instance one of the main reasons causing a noteworthy difference between the bias values related to karumba in comparison with other stations is that karumba station is within the norman river where other stations are located in an ocean among all the geology geomorphology and biology factors obtained in the optimization process the values related to cape ferguson and cardwell station are very close to each other which indicates the tide levels in these two stations must be very similar the obtained result is in line with the real tide levels recorded in these two stations and as it can be seen in fig 7 in january 2016 a randomly selected month the mean absolute tide level difference is just 14 6 cm the model performance was checked over the training validation and test dataset the high accuracy of the results as shown in table 4 and fig 8 indicates that the constructed deep neural network fig 5 is well designed optimized and reliable moreover as the difference between the average mae of all three datasets training validation and test is negligible it can be concluded that the model is not over fitted to the training data deep invistagtion on the results indicated that the highest errors were all related to the times that the stations faced abnormal water levels for intance the most intense error is related to the tide prediction for the date 03 02 2011 at 01 25 where the highest water level 6 24 m over the time period of 20 years was recoded fig 9 the time is exactly when north queensland experienced its largest and most powerful cyclone since 1918 tropical cyclone yasi with maximum recorded wind speed up to 185 km h cardwell was among the worst affected areas queensland government 2012 6 conclusions in this study a new deep neural network was proposed to predict a tide level at any time instance for different locations the network was designed based on four inputs 3 neurons for astronomical forces and 1 neuron for geology geomorphology and biology factors the proposed model was optimized over the data recorded from six stations in queensland australia with a novel method the geology geomorphology and biology factor of each station was obtained with respect to the tidal range of each location and relative to other stations the model performance was checked over the training validation and test dataset the high accuracy of the results indicated that the constructed deep neural network was well designed optimized and reliable one of the main advantages of the proposed method is its capability of estimating the tide level in different areas with high degree of accurately with an additional neuron in the input layer rather than having a new model for each location author contributions amin riazi conceived and designed the analysis collected the
