5900,prediction of sediment discharge transported within flow is strongly needed in order to provide measures for a well established erosion control and water quality management practice initiated by runoff generation and erosion processes sediment transport is influenced by microtopography over hillslopes of hydrological watersheds consideration of microtopography provides more accurate results in this study a process based two dimensional rainfall runoff mathematical model is coupled with erosion and sediment transport component both the rainfall runoff and sediment transport components make simulations in rills and over interrill areas of a bare hillslope models at such fine resolution are rarely verified due to the complexity of rills and interrill areas the model was applied on a data set compiled from laboratory experiments erosion flume was filled with granular sand to replace a bare soil a longitudinal rill and an interrill area were pre formed over the soil in the flume before the simulated rainfall exerted on the flume was given both longitudinal and lateral slopes the simulated rainfall was changed between 45 mm h and 105 mm h and exerted on granular uniform fine and medium sand in the erosion flume with longitudinal and lateral slopes both changing from 5 to 20 calibration of the model shows that it is able to produce good results in terms of sedigraphs which suggest also that the model might be considered an important step to verify and improve watershed scale erosion and sediment transport models keywords erosion flume rainfall simulator rill sedigraph sediment transport model soil erosion 1 introduction soil material detached from the surface of the soil matrix is subsequently transported away from the site of the detachment kinnell 2005 sediment transport is an important issue because it creates environmental concerns as well as engineering design problems sediment particles may absorb pollutants over the watershed carry them along the river and finally deposit within a receiving water body or at another point in the watershed it has also a potential to remove nutrients from the fertile agricultural lands in terms of engineering design problems the sediment load is a measure to predict the dead storage volume of the reservoir which should neither be underestimated nor overestimated both the underestimation and overestimation bring unnecessary costs in that maintenance or additional capacity would be needed in the former and construction costs would be higher than needed in the latter the sediment transport process is space and time dependent therefore it cannot be modelled by a single universal equation for the same reason several sediment transport models have so far been available in the literature at either hillslope or watershed scale in general the hydrological or sediment transport models are categorized based on different criteria such as process description scale and solution technique singh 1995 singh and woolhiser 2002 aksoy and kavvas 2004 empirical models are limited to the conditions for which they have been developed in conceptual models a watershed is represented by storage systems in the process based model mass conservation equation of sediment is used together with the momentum equation of the process the usle wischmeier and smith 1978 can be given as an example to the empirical models the hydrological part of answers beasley et al 1980 uses a conceptual process such models as kineros smith 1981 wesp lopes 1987 sem storm et al 1987 shesed wicks 1988 eurosem morgan et al 1998 erosion 3 d schmidt et al 1999 schindewolf and schmidt 2012 starkloff and stolte 2014 streams cerdan et al 2001 souchère et al 2005 couturier et al 2013 mahleran wainwright et al 2008a c and lisem de roo et al 1996 de roo and jetten 1999 starkloff and stolte 2014 are popular examples of the process based models which are all formulated by deterministic differential equations merritt et al 2003 aksoy and kavvas 2004 jetten and favis mortlock 2006 karydas et al 2014 as a development towards the non deterministic process based modelling kavvas et al 2004 proposed a two dimensional rainfall runoff model coupled with an environmental module to accommodate the erosion and sediment transport processes that consider the random behaviour of the watershed as well as the rill formation on the soil surface kavvas et al 2006 clearly such an analysis of erosion and sediment transport processes is not an easy task that requires simplification of the nature for which different approximations are needed at hillslope scale with no rilling rose et al 1983 modelled erosion due to rainfall and runoff by taking the rainfall intensity into account through an ordinary differential equation similarly hairsine and rose 1991 studied the erosion due to rainfall solely as a function of rainfall intensity it has been a custom to link the rainfall erosion to the rainfall intensity as used by lopes 1987 lopes and lane 1988 and proffitt et al 1991 in a similar study hairsine and rose 1992 rilling over hillslopes is considered together with the stochastic structure of the 2 mode sediment transport motion and no motion govindaraju and kavvas 1991 combined the surface flow model of govindaraju et al 1990 with the erosion model of foster and meyer 1972 the diffusion wave approach was used together with a sine curve flow depth approximation in the surface flow model an analytical solution was obtained to check the suitability of the model based on the field and laboratory experimental datasets of kilinc and richardson 1973 and singer and walker 1983 in a similar study laguna and giraldez 1993 used the kinematic wave approach in the hillslope scale erosion and sediment transport process the kinematic wave approach has been the key element of the two dimensional models of tayfur 2001 and aksoy et al 2003 kavvas and govindaraju 1992 govindaraju and kavvas 1992 and govindaraju et al 1992a b dealt with the rilling over hillslopes due to its importance in the sediment transport over hillslopes govindaraju 1995 derived dimensionless numbers and reduced number of calibration parameters to two one measures how erosive the flow is another shows how resistant the soil is against erosion i e how erodible it is the stochastic structure of the two parameters have further been investigated by govindaraju 1998 who concluded that the former fits the exponential probability distribution while the latter could be represented by independent random numbers the rilling structure of the topography has been considered not only at the hillslope scale but also at the watershed scale modeling in such models as the limburg soil erosion model lisem de roo et al 1996 chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management system creams foster et al 1981 water erosion prediction project wepp nearing et al 1989 and the european soil erosion model eurosem morgan et al 1998 among others the use and development of erosion and sediment transport models still expands due to the importance of the topic therefore an unsteady deterministic erosion and sediment transport model is developed based on the two dimensional continuity equation of sediment transported within flow the model developed in this study is the continuation of the two dimensional unsteady deterministic rainfall runoff model of aksoy et al 2016 in which only the longitudinal direction of flow is taken into account although it was derived from a two dimensional control volume the model is novel not only because of the reduction in the number of dimensions but also because it considers the rilling topography over a hillslope erosion exerted by rainfall and runoff are considered in the model the number of parameters is reduced to the least for the sake of obtaining as parsimonious a model as possible the parameters are calibrated and then validated with laboratory measurements a discussion of results is provided after which concluding remarks are finally presented 2 sediment transport model sediment transport model detailed below is coupled with a rainfall runoff model considering microtopography over the hillslope that accommodates rills and interrill areas aksoy et al 2016 in the microtopography over the hillslope as used in the rainfall runoff model of aksoy et al 2016 the hillslope was divided into rills and interrill areas in constructing the sediment transport model of this study 2 1 interrill area sediment transport model as used by tayfur and singh 2004 among others the time varying two dimensional continuity equation for sediment transport can be given by 1 h c s t q x c s x q y c s y e ρ s where h is flow depth l t is time t qx and qy are respectively flow rates l2t 1 through cross sections perpendicular to the x and y directions cs is volumetric concentration of sediment within flow l3l 3 ρs is mass density of sediment ml 3 and e mass of sediment eroded from unit area in unit time ml 2t 1 it should be noted that h cs and e are functions of both time and space x y taking derivatives in eq 1 results in 2 h t q x x q y y c s h c s t q x c s x q y c s y e ρ s the factor of cs in eq 2 can be linked to the time varying two dimensional continuity equation of rainfall runoff model aksoy et al 2016 which is given by 3 h t q x x q y y r f where r is rainfall intensity lt 1 and f is infiltration rate lt 1 substituting eq 3 into eq 2 results in 4 r f c s h c s t q x c s x q y c s y e ρ s the source term of eq 4 shows the total mass of rainfall erosion e r and runoff erosion e f as 5 e e r e f rainfall erosion is quantified usually in terms of rainfall intensity in the form of 6 e r α r β in which α and β are calibration parameters often associated with soil or energy properties tayfur 2002 α shows the detachability of the soil the higher α is the easier detached is the soil whereas β is taken in between 1 and 2 meyer 1971 foster et al 1977 foster 1982 sharma et al 1993 tayfur 2001 in this study it is assumed that rainfall intensity is constant and uniformly distributed over the hillslope the parameter α is indeed not constant therefore it can be taken as a function of rainfall intensity if needed as it was in the shesed model wicks 1988 not only α but also β has been considered as a function of rainfall intensity by wicks 1988 who found that the parameters decrease when rainfall intensity increases this is understandable as runoff is generated after rainfall and runoff erosion becomes dominant with increasing rainfall intensity runoff erosion is considered a function of the excess transport capacity and expressed as foster 1982 govindaraju et al 1992a b tayfur 2007 7 e f σ t c q s t c q s 0 t c q s where σ l 1 is model calibration parameter tc sediment transport capacity of flow ml 1t 1 and qs unit width sediment discharge transported within flow ml 1t 1 also from its dimension it is possible to note that ef corresponds to erosion from the unit area of a hillslope per unit time ml 2t 1 sediment particles detached from their original location are transported within flow it is clear that the amount of sediment within flow must be less than the sediment transport capacity of flow in order to ensure the transport of the eroded sediment particles in other words runoff can erode sediment particles from their place and transport them downstream when the transport capacity of flow is higher than the available sediment within flow in the opposite case when the transport capacity is less than the amount of sediment within flow deposition takes place this also means that available sediment within flow already exceeds the transport capacity and the exceedance portion of sediment is deposited deposition was not considered in the model development substituting eqs 6 and 7 into eq 5 gives 8 e α r β σ t c q s t c q s α r β t c q s the unit width sediment discharge q s in eq 8 can be determined by foster 1982 tayfur 2002 9 q s ρ s c s q while the transport capacity of flow is given as a function of net shear stress exerted on soil particles which is defined as the difference between the shear stress generated by runoff and its minimum critical value required for the detachment and transportation of sediment particles govindaraju and kavvas 1992 tayfur and singh 2004 10 t c η τ τ c ε in eq 10 η and ε are dimensionless calibration parameters τ and τc are the shear stress ml 1t 2 exerted by flow and its critical value respectively the critical shear stress is a measure of resistance of sediment particles against motion the higher the critical shear stress is the harder to detach the soil the critical shear stress τ c in eq 10 exists as a model parameter however as assumed by lopes 1987 within flow exist sediment particles already detached by wind and similar agents such sediment particles do not resist against flow this reduces eq 10 to 11 t c η τ ε however it should be kept in mind that the critical shear stress may not always be omitted but could be taken as an extra parameter of the model assuming that the hillslope behaves as a wide channel the shear stress is calculated by 12 τ ρ g h s in addition to the previously defined overland flow depth h l here ρ is mass density of water ml 3 g gravitational acceleration lt 2 and s the resulting topographical slope which can be given as defined in tayfur 2001 by 13 s s x 2 s y 2 hydraulic gradient is taken the same as the topographical slope when the kinematic wave approximation is used under the wide channel assumption considering eqs 6 13 eq 5 the source term of the sediment transport model is obtained as 14 e α r β σ η ρ g h s ε ρ s c s c z s 1 2 h 3 2 where cz is the chezy roughness coefficient l1 2t 1 returning back to the sediment transport model by considering eq 4 together with eq 14 and using the kinematic wave approximation results in 15 r f c s h c s t k x h 3 2 c s x k y h 3 2 c s y 1 ρ s α r β σ η ρ

19 y y sin π y 2 l y aksoy et al 2016 used this approximation as proposed by govindaraju et al 1988a b previously for the overland flow depth in the rainfall runoff model in the form of 20 h x y t y y

independent of the lateral distance at ly y where the interrill area reaches the rill the number of independent variables of sediment concentration and overland flow depth is reduced to two from three

used as in the hydrological component aksoy et al 2016 for solving eq 26 numerically considering h i as the flow depth at point i at current time and h i the flow depth at point i at previous time as defined previously in the hydrological component aksoy et al 2016 and similarly defining c i as sediment concentration at point i at current time and c i sediment concentration at point i at previous time 27 h i c i c i δ t 0 915312 k x h i 3 2 c i c i 1 δ x 1 27324 r f 0 8 k y l y h i 3 2 0 915312 σ c z s 1 2 h i 3 2 c i 2 α r β ρ s 2 σ ρ s η ρ g s ε h i ε φ ε is obtained as the finite difference

taken into account renders the water depth in rills to prevent rainfall from eroding sediment particles also the lateral contributions of sediment to rills from the interrill areas are considered fig 2 in which er is defined as rill erosion along the unit length of a rill in unit time ml 1t 1 and q s i r as incoming sediment rate from the right and left hand side interrill areas along the unit length of the rill ml 1t 1 taking other variables as defined previously the time dependent one dimensional continuity equation of sediment transport in the rill is given by tayfur and kavvas 1994 1998 tayfur 2007 30 a c s t q c s x 1 ρ s e r q s i r where a is rill cross section area l2 t is time t q is flow discharge l3t 1 and x is longitudinal distance along the rill l it should be noticed that a cs q er and qs ir change all with time and along the rill length taking derivatives in eq 30 and upon rearranging yields 31 a t q x c s a c s t q c s x 1 ρ s e r q s i r the factor of cs in eq 31 can be linked to the continuity equation of one dimensional flow in the rill given as 32 a t q x q l q ir where ql is excess rainfall on the rill l2t 1 and qir is flow coming from interrill areas along a unit length of the rill l2t 1 source terms in eq 32 are defined as 33 q l r f b 34 q lr q y lr x l y t in which r and f as defined before are rainfall intensity lt 1 and infiltration rate lt 1 respectively and b is the width of the rill l fig 2 in eq 34 q y ir is the unit width discharge lt 1 coming from the interrill area at the lateral distance y ly which is the most downstream section of the interrill area where it reaches the rill introducing eqs 32 34 into eq 31 yields 35 r f b q ir c s a c s t q c s x 1 ρ s e r q s i r erosion within a rill is taken only due to runoff and is given similar to the runoff erosion over interrill areas as in eq 7 by 36 e r σ r t cr q sr t cr q sr 0 t cr q sr in which σr is the first order reaction coefficient l 1 foster 1982 tcr is the sediment transport capacity of flow in the rill mt 1 and qsr is sediment load in the rill mt 1 it should be noticed that the erosion term in eq 36 is provided for the whole cross section of the rill not for the unit width as it was the case in the interrill area part of the model flow is not able to transport the incoming sediment when tcr qsr in this case deposition occurs under the limit condition when tcr qsr neither erosion nor deposition is observed this is the equilibrium case between tcr and qsr where what comes from the upstream is transported to the downstream when tcr qsr the incoming sediment is transported downstream also erosion is observed in order to fulfill the deficit between tcr and qsr it should be emphasized that erosion would be observed as long as the source material for the energy level of the flow is available the transport capacity of the flow in a rill is given by 37 t cr ρ s g where g is flow discharge through the rill cross section l3t 1 given by yalin 1963 as 38 g b v 0635 d δ 1 a ln 1 a δ in which b is width of the rill cross section at the water surface l v is shear velocity lt 1 and d is sediment size diameter l in eq 38 39 δ f f c 1 f f c 0 f f c in which f is the dimensionless shear stress given in yalin 1963 as 40 f τ ρ s ρ g d to compare with the constant critical shear stress f c 0 due to the fact that flow in the rill can be considered turbulent bogardi 1974 on the other hand yalin 1963 defined a in eq 38 by 41 a 2 45 f c 0 5 s 0 4 where s is the ratio of sediment mass density to water mass density after all these are considered eq 35 can be written as 42 r f b q ir σ r q c s a c s t q c s x 1 ρ s σ r t c q s i r 2 4 numerical solution of rill sediment transport model the backward finite difference scheme is used for the numerical solution of eq 42 based on the previous definitions of h i as flow depth at point i at current time h i as flow depth at point i at previous time in the hydrological component and c i as sediment concentration at point i at current time and c i as sediment concentration at point i at previous time 43 r f b q ir σ r q c i a c i c i δ t q c i c i 1 δ x 1 ρ s σ r t c q s i r is written as the numerical form of eq 42 sediment concentration within flow in a rill can simply be calculated from the numerical solution of eq 43 as 44 c i λ 3 λ 4 where 45a λ 3 σ r ρ s t c 1 ρ s q s i r a δ t c i q δ x c i 1 45b λ 4 r f b q ir σ r q a δ t q δ x 3 model parameters parameters of the sediment transport model are listed in table 1 they were calibrated by using experimental data of an indoor laboratory rainfall simulator with an erosion flume aksoy et al 2012 2013 arguelles et al 2013 in order for keeping the calibration simple two of the parameters β and ε were fixed as frequently applied in the literature singh and regl 1983 lopes and lane 1988 laguna and giraldez 1993 franchini 1994 govindaraju 1995 while the other four the rainfall erosion parameter α and the runoff erosion parameters σ and η over the interril area and σr in the rill are adjusted it should be noticed that additional parameters exist for the rainfall runoff part of the model aksoy et al 2016 parameters existing in the literature are listed in table 2 from which it is seen that they change within orders of magnitude for example σ 0 30 m 1 in singh and regl 1983 while it is 10 m 1 in govindaraju 1995 tayfur 2001 followed foster 1982 and proposed using the range of 3 33 m 1 for this particular parameter 4 experimental setup and measurements the experimental setup is composed of an indoor laboratory rainfall simulator with an erosion flume fig 3 the erosion flume is 6 50 m long 1 36 m wide and 17 cm deep the flume has adjustable longitudinal and lateral slopes it is filled with bare sand in advance before each experiment starts in the first series of the experiments the flume was filled with medium sand of median diameter d 50 0 45 mm while the fine sand with median diameter d 50 0 15 mm was used as the soil in the second series microtopography the rilling was considered in the experiments before the rainfall was applied in each experiment the sand filled flume was given an initial topography of a triangular cross section rill 2 cm deep and 26 cm wide longitudinally pre formed in the right hand side of the flume see the plan view of the erosion flume in the right panel of fig 4 however the effect of vegetation macro pore and small scale heterogeneity in the soil is not considered in the experiments as the surface of the sand is kept bare the rainfall simulator is equipped with four or five veejet nozzles spaced at 125 145 cm depending on the intensity of the simulated rainfall in the experiments four rainfall intensities 45 65 85 and 105 mmh 1 were applied subsequently four veejet 8030 and 8050 nozzles spaced 125 cm distance from each other were used for rainfall intensities of 45 and 65 mmh 1 respectively while the number of nozzles was increased to five veejet 8060 and 8070 with 100 cm distance for 85 and 105 mmh 1 respectively rainfall intensity was changed by using the proper number and size of veejet nozzles for each rainfall intensity 10 experiments were performed 40 experiments in total considering combinations of lateral and longitudinal slopes 5 10 15 20 conditional that longitudinal slope of the flume is not milder than its lateral slope for which 10 combinations exist when the 10 combinations of the longitudinal and lateral slopes were completed under four rainfall intensities a new series of experiments was performed by filling the erosion flume with another type of soil and performing experiments for the 10 combinations of longitudinal and lateral slopes under four rainfall intensities in each experiment a while after the rainfall was applied soil was saturated and surface flow was observed in the rill flow was not measured until surface flow reached the outlet of the flume after which rainfall was applied for 15 min flow was measured from the flume by means of measurement cups every 1 min or at as short time intervals as 10 15 s depending on how fast the cups were filled measurements continue to be taken for 10 more minutes after the rainfall ended the total time period for the measurement in each experiment was set at 25 min then the ascension curve the steady state period when it exists and the recession curve of hydrographs were constructed from the observations of the total volume collected at the two outlets of the flume more details on the experimental setup including the rainfall simulator observations measurements and the use of experimental data can be obtained from a series of publications by aksoy et al 2012 2013 2016 arguelles et al 2013 2014 and mallari et al 2015a b 5 model calibration model parameters were calibrated by the least square method to minimize the difference between the observed and calculated sediment discharges using m data pairs of x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x m y m from the experiments 46 y f x β can be written in which y is the model output as a function of x the model input and β β 1 β 2 β n the parameter vector where m n residual error between the observation and the model is calculated by 47 r i y i f x i β i 1 2 m the summation of the squared residuals is a vector computed as 48 s i 1 m r i 2 i 1 2 m it is minimized for the best approximation of the model to the observation minimization is satisfied when the derivative of s with respect to each independent variable is zero 49 s β j 2 i r i r i β j 0 j 1 n derivatives in eq 49 are functions of both independent variables and the parameters therefore an explicit solution is not achieved instead as an iterative solution 50 β j β j k 1 β j k δ β j is proposed by selecting initial values in which k is the iteration number and δ β is the numerical step selected for the parameter vector using the above methodology model calibration was carried out in two steps first 32 sedigraphs out of 40 were used for the calibration that is a single set of calibrated parameters was determined for each sedigraph from the calibrated parameters a new single set was obtained as the representative set of all sedigraphs this was performed by simply taking the average of two of the parameters and linking the other two to the rainfall intensity and resulting slope by a multiple linear regression optimized with genetic algorithm while performing the calibration not only the total mass of sediment was conserved but also the time varying structure of the sedigraph was taken into consideration that is the ascension and recession curves of the sedigraphs were paid particular attention each of 32 sedigraphs was fitted by the calibrated parameters listed in table 3 it is seen from table 3 that the calibrated model parameters vary within wide ranges as the parameters existing in the literature listed in table 2 change within orders of magnitude therefore the calibrated parameters in table 3 were considered consistent with the parameters existing in the literature fig 5 provides fitted simulations of sedigraphs at the calibration stage together with the corresponding hydrographs of the rainfall runoff model although sedigraphs are not as perfect as the hydrographs they are considerably well however in some cases significant discrepancies are observed between the experimental data and the fitted model the calibration can be considered satisfactory particularly when compared to the calibration studies reported in the literature such as shesed wicks 1988 wicks et al 1992 bathurst et al 1995 multsed wicks et al 1988 and wesp lopes 1987 lopes and lane 1988 6 model validation as pointed out above and seen in table 3 calibrated parameters vary within wide ranges however a proper calibration should provide one single set of representative parameters for all experimental runs it is hard to calibrate and then validate models with high number of parameters therefore in this study following the literature meyer 1971 foster et al 1977 foster 1982 sharma et al 1993 tayfur 2001 two parameters were taken constant at unity β 1 and ε 1 to make the model as parsimonious as possible another two parameters σ and σr were calibrated for each of the experimental data set after which their averages were taken for the validation stage they were fixed at the average values of 3 03 m 1 and 5 00 m 1 respectively obtained from the calibration set of experimental data table 3 finally another two parameters α and η were linked to the rainfall intensity and slope with the multi variable linear regression by the use of genetic algorithm a nonlinear search and optimization technique goldberg 1989 tayfur 2012 for which 100 chromosomes and 3000 iterations were performed in this study the parameters α and η were expressed as linear regression functions of rainfall intensity and slope as 51 α 0 6471 r 3 7692 s 65 92 52 η 0 000098 r 0 002872 s 0 16222 validated sedigraphs are given in fig 6 together with their corresponding hydrographs it is seen from fig 6 that the model has a relatively satisfactory performance in the ascension curve as well as during the steady state part of the sedigraph when exists flow is not under stable conditions which allow sediment to fluctuate randomly in a wide range with a general trace followed sediment concentration within flow is less predictive than the flow discharge because of this fluctuating behaviour compared to the rainfall erosion runoff erosion is more dominant therefore it provides substantial volume of sediment for transport within flow this is why sediment concentration shows sudden increases as pulses when runoff erosion starts by the end of the ascension curve or at the beginning of or during the steady state part of the sedigraph sediment is detached from its original place only when some prerequisite conditions are satisfied it happens for example after sediment becomes saturated such that the resistance of sediment is overcome by the weight of the saturated sediment under the limit conditions of saturation rainfall or runoff processes may trigger sediment to be transported in bulk volumes within flow this creates a sudden increase in the concentration to be noticed as a pulse in the sedigraph when the sediment is measured at the outlet of the erosion flume therefore measured sedigraphs fluctuate around a general behaviour of the sedigraph with ascension and recession curves between which a steady state part may be recorded the performance of the model is satisfactory as the model aims to replicate the general behavior of the process rather than capturing all measured points however it is quite noticeable that the measured recession curves of all runs are closely followed by the model the reason for this could be the post rainfall flow during recession within which sediment particles in motion are deposited as the rainfall ceases this shows the performance of the model in tracing the measured sediment discharge when the validation is evaluated under the light of this discussion it may be stated that the performance of the model is satisfactory if the discussion is extended to the rainfall runoff module to which the sediment module is coupled it should be stated that the model is calibrated first in terms of its rainfall runoff component to preserve the hydrograph then in terms of sediment component to preserve the sedigraph hydrographs are much better preserved aksoy et al 2016 because of the above explained less fluctuating behaviour of flow and more fluctuating behaviour of sediment concentration similar to the technique applied in the hydrological part aksoy et al 2016 model parameters are either fixed at their average or are regressed on rainfall intensity and slope with this practice the model becomes parsimonious 7 conclusions a two dimensional deterministic unsteady process based mathematical model is developed for the simulation of the rainfall and runoff induced erosion and sediment transport generated in rills and on interrill areas over a hillslope the model is calibrated and validated using a comprehensive dataset gathered from an indoor rainfall simulator and erosion flume where one can set specified lateral and longitudinal slopes changing from 5 to 20 the flume is exposed to rainfall simulated at intensities between 45 mmh 1 and 105 mmh 1 the number of erosion linked parameters is kept at minimum six in total for the sake of a parsimonious model two dimensionless exponent form parameters are fixed at unity as frequently applied in the literature two erosion coefficients one applied in the rill and another in the interrill areas are averaged over the calibration dataset while another two the erodibility factor of the soil under rainfall and the detachability factor of the soil under flow were regressed on rainfall intensity and topographical slope by the genetic algorithm the proposed model is considered novel because i microtopography is introduced in the rainfall runoff erosion and sediment transport mechanisms over a hillslope ii the longitudinal and the lateral topographical slopes are used in the model development iii two out of four calibration parameters in the sediment transport model are set at constant values while another two are adjusted using equations regressed on rainfall intensity and slope validated sedigraphs show that the erosion and sediment transport model is capable of simulating the total sediment outflow of interrill areas and rills over hilllslopes the model is potentially useful in the prediction of hillslope scale sediment transport process and can be taken as a well established background for a possible watershed scale erosion and sediment transport model declaration

5900,prediction of sediment discharge transported within flow is strongly needed in order to provide measures for a well established erosion control and water quality management practice initiated by runoff generation and erosion processes sediment transport is influenced by microtopography over hillslopes of hydrological watersheds consideration of microtopography provides more accurate results in this study a process based two dimensional rainfall runoff mathematical model is coupled with erosion and sediment transport component both the rainfall runoff and sediment transport components make simulations in rills and over interrill areas of a bare hillslope models at such fine resolution are rarely verified due to the complexity of rills and interrill areas the model was applied on a data set compiled from laboratory experiments erosion flume was filled with granular sand to replace a bare soil a longitudinal rill and an interrill area were pre formed over the soil in the flume before the simulated rainfall exerted on the flume was given both longitudinal and lateral slopes the simulated rainfall was changed between 45 mm h and 105 mm h and exerted on granular uniform fine and medium sand in the erosion flume with longitudinal and lateral slopes both changing from 5 to 20 calibration of the model shows that it is able to produce good results in terms of sedigraphs which suggest also that the model might be considered an important step to verify and improve watershed scale erosion and sediment transport models keywords erosion flume rainfall simulator rill sedigraph sediment transport model soil erosion 1 introduction soil material detached from the surface of the soil matrix is subsequently transported away from the site of the detachment kinnell 2005 sediment transport is an important issue because it creates environmental concerns as well as engineering design problems sediment particles may absorb pollutants over the watershed carry them along the river and finally deposit within a receiving water body or at another point in the watershed it has also a potential to remove nutrients from the fertile agricultural lands in terms of engineering design problems the sediment load is a measure to predict the dead storage volume of the reservoir which should neither be underestimated nor overestimated both the underestimation and overestimation bring unnecessary costs in that maintenance or additional capacity would be needed in the former and construction costs would be higher than needed in the latter the sediment transport process is space and time dependent therefore it cannot be modelled by a single universal equation for the same reason several sediment transport models have so far been available in the literature at either hillslope or watershed scale in general the hydrological or sediment transport models are categorized based on different criteria such as process description scale and solution technique singh 1995 singh and woolhiser 2002 aksoy and kavvas 2004 empirical models are limited to the conditions for which they have been developed in conceptual models a watershed is represented by storage systems in the process based model mass conservation equation of sediment is used together with the momentum equation of the process the usle wischmeier and smith 1978 can be given as an example to the empirical models the hydrological part of answers beasley et al 1980 uses a conceptual process such models as kineros smith 1981 wesp lopes 1987 sem storm et al 1987 shesed wicks 1988 eurosem morgan et al 1998 erosion 3 d schmidt et al 1999 schindewolf and schmidt 2012 starkloff and stolte 2014 streams cerdan et al 2001 souchère et al 2005 couturier et al 2013 mahleran wainwright et al 2008a c and lisem de roo et al 1996 de roo and jetten 1999 starkloff and stolte 2014 are popular examples of the process based models which are all formulated by deterministic differential equations merritt et al 2003 aksoy and kavvas 2004 jetten and favis mortlock 2006 karydas et al 2014 as a development towards the non deterministic process based modelling kavvas et al 2004 proposed a two dimensional rainfall runoff model coupled with an environmental module to accommodate the erosion and sediment transport processes that consider the random behaviour of the watershed as well as the rill formation on the soil surface kavvas et al 2006 clearly such an analysis of erosion and sediment transport processes is not an easy task that requires simplification of the nature for which different approximations are needed at hillslope scale with no rilling rose et al 1983 modelled erosion due to rainfall and runoff by taking the rainfall intensity into account through an ordinary differential equation similarly hairsine and rose 1991 studied the erosion due to rainfall solely as a function of rainfall intensity it has been a custom to link the rainfall erosion to the rainfall intensity as used by lopes 1987 lopes and lane 1988 and proffitt et al 1991 in a similar study hairsine and rose 1992 rilling over hillslopes is considered together with the stochastic structure of the 2 mode sediment transport motion and no motion govindaraju and kavvas 1991 combined the surface flow model of govindaraju et al 1990 with the erosion model of foster and meyer 1972 the diffusion wave approach was used together with a sine curve flow depth approximation in the surface flow model an analytical solution was obtained to check the suitability of the model based on the field and laboratory experimental datasets of kilinc and richardson 1973 and singer and walker 1983 in a similar study laguna and giraldez 1993 used the kinematic wave approach in the hillslope scale erosion and sediment transport process the kinematic wave approach has been the key element of the two dimensional models of tayfur 2001 and aksoy et al 2003 kavvas and govindaraju 1992 govindaraju and kavvas 1992 and govindaraju et al 1992a b dealt with the rilling over hillslopes due to its importance in the sediment transport over hillslopes govindaraju 1995 derived dimensionless numbers and reduced number of calibration parameters to two one measures how erosive the flow is another shows how resistant the soil is against erosion i e how erodible it is the stochastic structure of the two parameters have further been investigated by govindaraju 1998 who concluded that the former fits the exponential probability distribution while the latter could be represented by independent random numbers the rilling structure of the topography has been considered not only at the hillslope scale but also at the watershed scale modeling in such models as the limburg soil erosion model lisem de roo et al 1996 chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management system creams foster et al 1981 water erosion prediction project wepp nearing et al 1989 and the european soil erosion model eurosem morgan et al 1998 among others the use and development of erosion and sediment transport models still expands due to the importance of the topic therefore an unsteady deterministic erosion and sediment transport model is developed based on the two dimensional continuity equation of sediment transported within flow the model developed in this study is the continuation of the two dimensional unsteady deterministic rainfall runoff model of aksoy et al 2016 in which only the longitudinal direction of flow is taken into account although it was derived from a two dimensional control volume the model is novel not only because of the reduction in the number of dimensions but also because it considers the rilling topography over a hillslope erosion exerted by rainfall and runoff are considered in the model the number of parameters is reduced to the least for the sake of obtaining as parsimonious a model as possible the parameters are calibrated and then validated with laboratory measurements a discussion of results is provided after which concluding remarks are finally presented 2 sediment transport model sediment transport model detailed below is coupled with a rainfall runoff model considering microtopography over the hillslope that accommodates rills and interrill areas aksoy et al 2016 in the microtopography over the hillslope as used in the rainfall runoff model of aksoy et al 2016 the hillslope was divided into rills and interrill areas in constructing the sediment transport model of this study 2 1 interrill area sediment transport model as used by tayfur and singh 2004 among others the time varying two dimensional continuity equation for sediment transport can be given by 1 h c s t q x c s x q y c s y e ρ s where h is flow depth l t is time t qx and qy are respectively flow rates l2t 1 through cross sections perpendicular to the x and y directions cs is volumetric concentration of sediment within flow l3l 3 ρs is mass density of sediment ml 3 and e mass of sediment eroded from unit area in unit time ml 2t 1 it should be noted that h cs and e are functions of both time and space x y taking derivatives in eq 1 results in 2 h t q x x q y y c s h c s t q x c s x q y c s y e ρ s the factor of cs in eq 2 can be linked to the time varying two dimensional continuity equation of rainfall runoff model aksoy et al 2016 which is given by 3 h t q x x q y y r f where r is rainfall intensity lt 1 and f is infiltration rate lt 1 substituting eq 3 into eq 2 results in 4 r f c s h c s t q x c s x q y c s y e ρ s the source term of eq 4 shows the total mass of rainfall erosion e r and runoff erosion e f as 5 e e r e f rainfall erosion is quantified usually in terms of rainfall intensity in the form of 6 e r α r β in which α and β are calibration parameters often associated with soil or energy properties tayfur 2002 α shows the detachability of the soil the higher α is the easier detached is the soil whereas β is taken in between 1 and 2 meyer 1971 foster et al 1977 foster 1982 sharma et al 1993 tayfur 2001 in this study it is assumed that rainfall intensity is constant and uniformly distributed over the hillslope the parameter α is indeed not constant therefore it can be taken as a function of rainfall intensity if needed as it was in the shesed model wicks 1988 not only α but also β has been considered as a function of rainfall intensity by wicks 1988 who found that the parameters decrease when rainfall intensity increases this is understandable as runoff is generated after rainfall and runoff erosion becomes dominant with increasing rainfall intensity runoff erosion is considered a function of the excess transport capacity and expressed as foster 1982 govindaraju et al 1992a b tayfur 2007 7 e f σ t c q s t c q s 0 t c q s where σ l 1 is model calibration parameter tc sediment transport capacity of flow ml 1t 1 and qs unit width sediment discharge transported within flow ml 1t 1 also from its dimension it is possible to note that ef corresponds to erosion from the unit area of a hillslope per unit time ml 2t 1 sediment particles detached from their original location are transported within flow it is clear that the amount of sediment within flow must be less than the sediment transport capacity of flow in order to ensure the transport of the eroded sediment particles in other words runoff can erode sediment particles from their place and transport them downstream when the transport capacity of flow is higher than the available sediment within flow in the opposite case when the transport capacity is less than the amount of sediment within flow deposition takes place this also means that available sediment within flow already exceeds the transport capacity and the exceedance portion of sediment is deposited deposition was not considered in the model development substituting eqs 6 and 7 into eq 5 gives 8 e α r β σ t c q s t c q s α r β t c q s the unit width sediment discharge q s in eq 8 can be determined by foster 1982 tayfur 2002 9 q s ρ s c s q while the transport capacity of flow is given as a function of net shear stress exerted on soil particles which is defined as the difference between the shear stress generated by runoff and its minimum critical value required for the detachment and transportation of sediment particles govindaraju and kavvas 1992 tayfur and singh 2004 10 t c η τ τ c ε in eq 10 η and ε are dimensionless calibration parameters τ and τc are the shear stress ml 1t 2 exerted by flow and its critical value respectively the critical shear stress is a measure of resistance of sediment particles against motion the higher the critical shear stress is the harder to detach the soil the critical shear stress τ c in eq 10 exists as a model parameter however as assumed by lopes 1987 within flow exist sediment particles already detached by wind and similar agents such sediment particles do not resist against flow this reduces eq 10 to 11 t c η τ ε however it should be kept in mind that the critical shear stress may not always be omitted but could be taken as an extra parameter of the model assuming that the hillslope behaves as a wide channel the shear stress is calculated by 12 τ ρ g h s in addition to the previously defined overland flow depth h l here ρ is mass density of water ml 3 g gravitational acceleration lt 2 and s the resulting topographical slope which can be given as defined in tayfur 2001 by 13 s s x 2 s y 2 hydraulic gradient is taken the same as the topographical slope when the kinematic wave approximation is used under the wide channel assumption considering eqs 6 13 eq 5 the source term of the sediment transport model is obtained as 14 e α r β σ η ρ g h s ε ρ s c s c z s 1 2 h 3 2 where cz is the chezy roughness coefficient l1 2t 1 returning

19 y y sin π y 2 l y aksoy et al 2016 used this approximation as proposed by govindaraju et al 1988a b previously for the overland flow depth in the rainfall runoff model in the form of 20 h x y t y y

independent of the lateral distance at ly y where the interrill area reaches the rill the number of independent variables of sediment concentration and overland flow depth is reduced to two from three

used as in the hydrological component aksoy et al 2016 for solving eq 26 numerically considering h i as the flow depth at point i at current time and h i the flow depth at point i at previous time as defined previously in the hydrological component aksoy et al 2016 and similarly defining c i as sediment concentration at point i at current time and c i sediment concentration at point i at previous

taken into account renders the water depth in rills to prevent rainfall from eroding sediment particles also the lateral contributions of sediment to rills from the interrill areas are considered fig 2 in which er is defined as rill erosion along the unit length of a rill in unit time ml 1t 1 and q s i r as incoming sediment rate from the right and left hand side interrill areas along the unit length of the rill ml 1t 1 taking other variables as defined previously the time dependent one dimensional continuity equation of sediment transport in the rill is given by tayfur and kavvas 1994 1998 tayfur 2007 30 a c s t q c s x 1 ρ s e r q s i r where a is rill cross section area l2 t is time t q is flow discharge l3t 1 and x is longitudinal distance along the rill l it should be noticed that a cs q er and qs ir change all with time and along the rill length taking derivatives in eq 30 and upon rearranging yields 31 a t q x c s a c s t q c s x 1 ρ s e r q s i r the factor of cs in eq 31 can be linked to the continuity equation of one dimensional flow in the rill given as 32 a t q x q l q ir where ql is excess rainfall on the rill l2t 1 and qir is flow coming from interrill areas along a unit length of the rill l2t 1 source terms in eq 32 are defined as 33 q l r f b 34 q lr q y lr x l y t in which r and f as defined before are rainfall intensity lt 1 and infiltration rate lt 1 respectively and b is the width of the rill l fig 2 in eq 34 q y ir is the unit width discharge lt 1 coming from the interrill area at the lateral distance y ly which is the most downstream section of the interrill area where it reaches the rill introducing eqs 32 34 into eq 31 yields 35 r f b q ir c s a c s t q c s x 1 ρ s e r q s i r erosion within a rill is taken only due to runoff and is given similar to the runoff erosion over interrill areas as in eq 7 by 36 e r σ r t cr q sr t cr q sr 0 t cr q sr in which σr is the first order reaction coefficient l 1 foster 1982 tcr is the sediment transport capacity of flow in the rill mt 1 and qsr is sediment load in the rill mt 1 it should be noticed that the erosion term in eq 36 is provided for the whole cross section of the rill not for the unit width as it was the case in the interrill area part of the model flow is not able to transport the incoming sediment when tcr qsr in this case deposition occurs under the limit condition when tcr qsr neither erosion nor deposition is observed this is the equilibrium case between tcr and qsr where what comes from the upstream is transported to the downstream when tcr qsr the incoming sediment is transported downstream also erosion is observed in order to fulfill the deficit between tcr and qsr it should be emphasized that erosion would be observed as long as the source material for the energy level of the flow is available the transport capacity of the flow in a rill is given by 37 t cr ρ s g where g is flow discharge through the rill cross section l3t 1 given by yalin 1963 as 38 g b v 0635 d δ 1 a ln 1 a δ in which b is width of the rill cross section at the water surface l v is shear velocity lt 1 and d is sediment size diameter l in eq 38 39 δ f f c 1 f f c 0 f f c in which f is the dimensionless shear stress given in yalin 1963 as 40 f τ ρ s ρ g d to compare with the constant critical shear stress f c 0 due to the fact that flow in the rill can be considered turbulent bogardi 1974 on the other hand yalin 1963 defined a in eq 38 by 41 a 2 45 f c 0 5 s 0 4 where s is the ratio of sediment mass density to water mass density after all these are considered eq

laboratory rainfall simulator with an erosion flume aksoy et al 2012 2013 arguelles et al 2013 in order for keeping the calibration simple two of the parameters β and ε were fixed as frequently applied in the literature singh and regl 1983 lopes and lane 1988 laguna and giraldez 1993 franchini 1994 govindaraju 1995 while the other four the rainfall erosion parameter α and the runoff erosion parameters σ and η over the interril area and σr in the rill are adjusted it should be noticed that additional parameters exist for the rainfall runoff part of the model aksoy et al 2016 parameters existing in the literature are listed in table 2 from which it is seen that they change within orders of magnitude for example σ 0 30 m 1 in singh and regl 1983 while it is 10 m 1 in govindaraju 1995 tayfur 2001 followed foster 1982 and proposed using the range of 3 33 m 1 for this particular parameter 4 experimental setup and measurements the experimental setup is composed of an indoor laboratory rainfall simulator with an erosion flume fig 3 the erosion flume is 6 50 m long 1 36 m wide and 17 cm deep the flume has adjustable longitudinal and lateral slopes it is filled with bare sand in advance before each experiment starts in the first series of the experiments the flume was filled with medium sand of median diameter d 50 0 45 mm while the fine sand with median diameter d 50 0 15 mm was used as the soil in the second series microtopography the rilling was considered in the experiments before the rainfall was applied in each experiment the sand filled flume was given an initial topography of a triangular cross section rill 2 cm deep and 26 cm wide longitudinally pre formed in the right hand side of the flume see the plan view of the erosion flume in the right panel of fig 4 however the effect of vegetation macro pore and small scale heterogeneity in the soil is not considered in the experiments as the surface of the sand is kept bare the rainfall simulator is equipped with four or five veejet nozzles spaced at 125 145 cm depending on the intensity of the simulated rainfall in the experiments four rainfall intensities 45 65 85 and 105 mmh 1 were applied subsequently four veejet 8030 and 8050 nozzles spaced 125 cm distance from each other were used for rainfall intensities of 45 and 65 mmh 1 respectively while the number of nozzles was increased to five veejet 8060 and 8070 with 100 cm distance for 85 and 105 mmh 1 respectively rainfall intensity was changed by using the proper number and size of veejet nozzles for each rainfall intensity 10 experiments were performed 40 experiments in total considering combinations of lateral and longitudinal slopes 5 10 15 20 conditional that longitudinal slope of the flume is not milder than its lateral slope for which 10 combinations exist when the 10 combinations of the longitudinal and lateral slopes were completed under four rainfall intensities a new series of experiments was performed by filling the erosion flume with another type of soil and performing experiments for the 10 combinations of longitudinal and lateral slopes under four rainfall intensities in each experiment a while after the rainfall was applied soil was saturated and surface flow was observed in the rill flow was not measured until surface flow reached the outlet of the flume after which rainfall was applied for 15 min flow was measured from the flume by means of measurement cups every 1 min or at as short time intervals as 10 15 s depending on how fast the cups were filled measurements continue to be taken for 10 more minutes after the rainfall ended the total time period for the measurement in each experiment was set at 25 min then the ascension curve the steady state period when it exists and the recession curve of hydrographs were constructed from the observations of the total volume collected at the two outlets of the flume more details on the experimental setup including the rainfall simulator observations measurements and the use of experimental data can be obtained from a series of publications by aksoy et al 2012 2013 2016 arguelles et al 2013 2014 and mallari et al 2015a b 5 model calibration model parameters were calibrated by the least square method to minimize the difference between the observed and calculated sediment discharges using m data pairs of x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x m y m from the experiments 46 y f x β can be written in which y is the model output as a function of x the model input and β β 1 β 2 β n the parameter vector where m n residual error between the observation and the model is calculated by 47 r i y i f x i β i 1 2 m the summation of the squared residuals is a vector computed as 48 s i 1 m r i 2 i 1 2 m it is minimized for the best approximation of the model to the observation minimization is satisfied when the derivative of s with respect to each independent variable is zero 49 s β j 2 i r i r i β j 0 j 1 n derivatives in eq 49 are functions of both independent variables and the parameters therefore an explicit solution is not achieved instead as an iterative solution 50 β j β j k 1 β j k δ β j is proposed by selecting initial values in which k is the iteration number and δ β is the numerical step selected for the parameter vector using the above methodology model calibration was carried out in two steps first 32 sedigraphs out of 40 were used for the calibration that is a single set of calibrated parameters was determined for each sedigraph from the calibrated parameters a new single set was obtained as the representative set of all sedigraphs this was performed by simply taking the average of two of the parameters and linking the other two to the rainfall intensity and resulting slope by a multiple linear regression optimized with genetic algorithm while performing the calibration not only the total mass of sediment was conserved but also the time varying structure of the sedigraph was taken into consideration that is the ascension and recession curves of the sedigraphs were paid particular attention each of 32 sedigraphs was fitted by the calibrated parameters listed in table 3 it is seen from table 3 that the calibrated model parameters vary within wide ranges as the parameters existing in the literature listed in table 2 change within orders of magnitude therefore the calibrated parameters in table 3 were considered consistent with the parameters existing in the literature fig 5 provides fitted simulations of sedigraphs at the calibration stage together with the corresponding hydrographs of the rainfall runoff model although sedigraphs are not as perfect as the hydrographs they are considerably well however in some cases significant discrepancies are observed between the experimental data and the fitted model the calibration can be considered satisfactory particularly when compared to the calibration studies reported in the literature such as shesed wicks 1988 wicks et al 1992 bathurst et al 1995 multsed wicks et al 1988 and wesp lopes 1987 lopes and lane 1988 6 model validation as pointed out above and seen in table 3 calibrated parameters vary within wide ranges however a proper calibration should provide one single set of representative parameters for all experimental runs it is hard to calibrate and then validate models with high number of parameters therefore in this study following the literature meyer 1971 foster et al 1977 foster 1982 sharma et al 1993 tayfur 2001 two parameters were taken constant at unity β 1 and ε 1 to make the model as parsimonious as possible another two parameters σ and σr were calibrated for each of the experimental data set after which their averages were taken for the validation stage they were fixed at the average values of 3 03 m 1 and 5 00 m 1 respectively obtained from the calibration set of experimental data table 3 finally another two parameters α and η were linked to the rainfall intensity and slope with the multi variable linear regression by the use of genetic algorithm a nonlinear search and optimization technique goldberg 1989 tayfur 2012 for which 100 chromosomes and 3000 iterations were performed in this study the parameters α and η were expressed as linear regression functions of rainfall intensity and slope as 51 α 0 6471 r 3 7692 s 65 92 52 η 0 000098 r 0 002872 s 0 16222 validated sedigraphs are given in fig 6 together with their corresponding hydrographs it is seen from fig 6 that the model has a relatively satisfactory performance in the ascension curve as well as during the steady state part of the sedigraph when exists flow is not under stable conditions which allow sediment to fluctuate randomly in a wide range with a general trace followed sediment concentration within flow is less predictive than the flow discharge because of this fluctuating behaviour compared to the rainfall erosion runoff erosion is more dominant therefore it provides substantial volume of sediment for transport within flow this is why sediment concentration shows sudden increases as pulses when runoff erosion starts by the end of the ascension curve or at the beginning of or during the steady state part of the sedigraph sediment is detached from its original place only when some prerequisite conditions are satisfied it happens for example after sediment becomes saturated such that the resistance of sediment is overcome by the weight of the saturated sediment under the limit conditions of saturation rainfall or runoff processes may trigger sediment to be transported in bulk volumes within flow this creates a sudden increase in the concentration to be noticed as a pulse in the sedigraph when the sediment is measured at the outlet of the erosion flume therefore measured sedigraphs fluctuate around a general behaviour of the sedigraph with ascension and recession curves between which a steady state part may be recorded the performance of the model is satisfactory as the model aims to replicate the general behavior of the process rather than capturing all measured points however it is quite noticeable that the measured recession curves of all runs are closely followed by the model the reason for this could be the post rainfall flow during recession within which sediment particles in motion are deposited as the rainfall ceases this shows the performance of the model in tracing the measured sediment discharge when the validation is evaluated under the light of this discussion it may be stated that the performance of the model is satisfactory if the discussion is extended to the rainfall runoff module to which the sediment module is coupled it should be stated that the model is calibrated first in terms of its rainfall runoff component to preserve the hydrograph then in terms of sediment component to preserve the sedigraph hydrographs are much better preserved aksoy et al 2016 because of the above explained less fluctuating behaviour of flow and more fluctuating behaviour of sediment concentration similar to the technique applied in the hydrological part aksoy et al 2016 model parameters are either fixed at their average or are regressed on rainfall intensity and slope with this practice the model becomes parsimonious 7 conclusions a two dimensional deterministic unsteady process based mathematical model is developed for the simulation of the rainfall and runoff induced erosion and sediment transport generated in rills and on interrill areas over a hillslope the model is calibrated and validated using a comprehensive dataset gathered from an indoor rainfall simulator and erosion flume where one can set specified lateral and longitudinal slopes changing from 5 to 20 the flume is exposed to rainfall simulated at intensities between 45 mmh 1 and 105 mmh 1 the number of erosion linked parameters is kept at minimum six in total for the sake of a parsimonious model two dimensionless exponent form parameters are fixed at unity as frequently applied in the literature two erosion coefficients one applied in the rill and another in the interrill areas are averaged over the calibration dataset while another two the erodibility factor of the soil under rainfall and the detachability factor of the soil under flow were regressed on rainfall intensity and topographical slope by the genetic algorithm the proposed model is considered novel because i microtopography is introduced in the rainfall runoff erosion and sediment transport mechanisms over a hillslope ii the longitudinal and the lateral topographical slopes are used in the model development iii two out of four calibration parameters in the sediment transport model are set at constant values while another two are adjusted using equations regressed on rainfall intensity and slope validated sedigraphs show that the erosion and sediment transport model is capable of simulating the total sediment outflow of interrill areas and rills over hilllslopes the model is potentially useful in the prediction of hillslope scale sediment transport process and can be taken as a well established background for a possible watershed scale erosion and sediment transport model declaration

5901,geochemical compositions changes in groundwater in response to earthquakes have been documented for decades and most such studies have documented the changes in major ions or geochemical gases e g radon changes in trace elements however have received less attention in this paper we collected groundwater samples from a wellbore in yunnan province weekly and analyzed both the major and trace chemical compositions from february 2018 to september 2018 combined with well water level records we found that the august 2018 tonghai m5 0 earthquake caused changes in both water levels and trace elements but caused no significant changes in the stable isotope and major ions such a response indicates that trace elements are more sensitive to crustal strain than are the major elements and isotopes and we considered that earthquake induced shaking caused a breach in the hydraulic barrier of the isolated reservoir that led to the mixing of water with low concentrations of trace elements as the mechanism to explain the coseismic response this study demonstrate that some trace elements are more sensitive to earthquake strain than the commonly used chemical constitutents and that trace element monitoring should considered to be a priority in the future to provide a complete assessment of the sensitivity of different chemical constitutents to earthquake stresses keywords trace elements earthquake chemical components permeability 1 introduction changes in groundwater levels temperatures chemical compositions and stream flows following local and distant earthquakes have been documented for decades manga and wang 2015 montgomery and manga 2003 roeloffs 1998 skelton et al 2014 toutain et al 1997 wang and manga 2010 because of the feasibility of using automated monitoring systems earthquake related changes in water levels temperatures stream flows and radon concentrations are the most commonly reported responses king 1986 kitagawa et al 1996 manga and wang 2015 in contrast groundwater geochemical changes induced by earthquakes have been documented relatively rarely although such changes are always considered to be sensitive to crustal stress and to be benefical for earthquake prediction manga and wang 2015 thomas 1988 wakita 1996 the challenges in geochemical monitoring mainly originate from the lack of continuous and long term monitoring systems woith et al 2013 and manual sampling and expensive time consuming laboratory analyses are required wang and manga 2010 however such studies are highly important as earthquake related chemical changes provide more information regarding water rock interactions and provide information from the deep crust thomas 1988 an excellent example of such a study is the long term series of hydrochemical monitoring operations in iceland preseismic changes of five parameters na si k δ18o and δ2h were found before three earthquakes and the post seismic changes of eight parameters ca na si cl f so4 δ18o δ2h were documented to be associated with three different earthquakes skelton et al 2019 the study of hydrochemical changes during the 2016 2017 seismic sequence in central italy showed that trace elements e g al cu pb mn sr exhibited post seismic peak changes in four hot springs but only small changes for the major ions rosen et al 2018 additionally another study of the hydrochemical responses to the 2016 2017 seismic sequence in central italy documented changes of trace elements as fe v and cr that were associated with the seismic sequence but showed no changes for the major ions k na ca mg and cl or for other trace elements li b and sr that could be found in springs and wells barberio et al 2017 however changes of trace elements major elements and isotope changes have also been observed simultaneously before and after major earthquakes claesson et al 2004 furthermore several other studies have documented the sensitive responses of metal elements e g iron and lead and their isotopes to earthquakes poitrasson et al 1999 schuessler et al 2016 there are many different elements in groundwater that may show responses to seismic activities thus another challenge of geochemical monitoring for earthquake related studies is to understand which geochemical elements would be good candidates for monitoring we summarize the current understanding of this topic in table 1 from table 1 we see that most documented studies have used the major elements and only a few studies have used both major and trace elements to study the hydrochemical responses additionally the trace elements seem to show more sensitive responses to earthquakes but each case showed specific sensitive elements it is worth paying more attention to comparison of the responses of major elements and trace elements to earthquakes and to discuss why such phenomena occur in this paper we analyzed both the major and trace elements in a groundwater monitoring well from february 2018 to september 2018 and we found that only the trace elements showed clear co seismic responses following the tonghai m5 0 earthquake while the major elements and hydrogen oxygen stable isotopes showed no responses such observations are quite different from previous studies and we discuss the origin of these phenomena and their implications for future monitoring 2 study area as part of the earthquake precursor detection program groundwater level monitoring plays a key role for precursor detection in china and a nationwide network of monitoring wells located along strain sensitive locations has been constructed for this purpose the groundwater level data is usually recorded at one minute or one hour intervals by an ln 3a digital instrument developed by the institute of earthquake science china earthquake administration in this study we choose the jiangchuan well 24 33 n 102 73 e 1726 m located in yucun village qianwei town of jiangchuan city for the geochemical monitoring study since the well belongs to the yunnan earthquake administration the staff works at this station and conducted the weekly water sampling geographically this well is located in the jiangchuan rift basin near the junction of the xiaojiang and yuchuan fault zones the well is surrounded by low mountains and hilly regions with level topography nearby xingyun lake is 1 5 km from the well and has an area of 34 71 km2 with an average water depth of 7 m in addition a river is located 20 m from the well and this river is mainly used for irrigation from mid april to the end of april from the reservoir upstream without the reservoir drainage only a few ponds exist along in the river since the study area is a lacustrine depositional basin the lithology consists of quaternary clay sand and gravel and underlying the tertiary gravel mudstone and shale with limestone and dolomite below the jc well was drilled in 1985 with a depth of 180 m but the current depth is only 140 m as silt clogged the bottom of the well the well is an artesian well with a flow rate near 38 ml s the major aquitard is the alluvial and lacustrine clay located in the upper 10 m of the well below are clay layers mixed with different thickness of fine sand from 10 m to 113 7 m the wellbore is open to sinian system quartz sandstones and shales from 113 7 m to the bottom of the well this is the one of the major aquifers in this well aquifer system the well is also screened at depth of 16 6 26 4 m 51 3 60 m and 79 37 89 7 m fig 1 as the well is located in an area of geothermal anomalies the water temperature is approximately 34 2 c groundwater in the wellbore mixes with groundwater from different aquifers the groundwater level in this well decreased from february 2018 and reached the lowest level at the end of may and the well water level then began to rise such changes may have been related to precipitation as there is large precipitation during summer which may increase recharge to the aquifer and cause increasing water levels fig 2 3 methods 3 1 data collection water samples were collected by the staff working at this station every 5 7 days and sample collection began in february 2018 each sample was filtered with 0 2 μm membranes on site and was stored in two 500 ml polyethylene bottles hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes were collected in 50 ml polyethylene bottles all samples were sent monthly to the china university of geoscience beijing for further analysis such sample collections continued until september 2018 and a total of 28 water samples were collected during this period all water samples were analyzed for major ions such as k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and f and for trace elements li b al sc ti v cr fe rb and cs the cl no3 so4 2 f were analyzed by means of ion chromatography dionex 900 the stable isotopes of 18o and deuterium were analyzed with a liquid water isotope analyzer lgr with an accuracy of 0 2 for 18o and an accuracy of 0 3 for d the hco3 levels were measured by a potentiometric titrator and the ca2 mg2 na and k concentrations were analyzed by icp aes and the trace elements were analyzed with a thermo fisher x series ii icp ms at the institute of crustal dynamics cea all samples were analyzed by the same staff using the same instruments during the measurements each trace element was measured at least three times and if the results showed differences less than 5 we used the average values of the measurements as the concentrations 3 2 anova analysis the anova test was used to analyze the differences among group means in a sample and it provided a statistical test to show whether two or more means were equal kleinbaum et al 1988 we used one way anova to analyze the data we grouped the data into two groups before the earthquake and after the earthquake and we compared the differences between the two groups the analysis was done with ibm spss 22 allen et al 2014 4 results on august 14th 2018 an earthquake with a magnitude of 5 0 occurred in tonghai city with an epicenteral distance of 16 6 km fig 1 the seismic energy density produced by this earthquake at the jiangchuan well was approximately 6 02 j m3 according to wang 2007 considerably larger than the minimum energy density 10 4 j m3 that is required for triggering hydrological responses based on global observations wang 2007 thus it was expected that there may have been co seismic hydrological responses following this earthquake for the jiangchuan well the groundwater level increased from 0 41 m to 0 43 m following the m5 0 earthquake next we checked if there are any changes before and after the earthquake the result of analyses of the 28 samples are listed in tables 2 and 3 from table 2 we see that the ion balances of all samples were less than 5 which indicated credible analysis results for these samples the groundwater in this well was of the na hco3 type during the study period na and k and showed a decreasing trend during the study period na decreased from 376 mg l to 364 mg l k decreased from 15 0 mg l to 13 8 mg l and mg2 decreased from 2 1 mg l to 1 9 mg l cl hco3 so4 2 and ca2 show increases and f was relatively stable figs 3a b cl increased from 100 mg l to 135 mg l hco3 increased from 700 mg l to 780 mg l so4 2 increased from 60 mg l to 72 mg l and ca2 increased from 10 mg l to 23 mg l there were some fluctuations in the major ions that occurred before the tonghai earthquake f cl and so4 2 but no clear co seismic changes were found following the earthquake for the hydrogen and oxygen isotope data we plotted all samples that were collected from the jc well and also examined the water samples from the surface water and a domestic well the deuterium and oxygen isotopes only exhibited small fluctuations during the study period fig 4 the deuterium isotope levels varied from 100 to 98 and the oxygen isotope levels varied from 13 6 to 13 no clear changes for the major ions or for the stable isotopes were found following the earthquake figs 3 4 we further checked the trace elements for this well and found that there were clear co seismic decreases in the trace elements fig 5 among 20 measured different trace element constituents nine trace elements showed large decreases following the two m5 0 earthquakes and did not recover in over a short period li decreased from 700 ppb to 660 ppb following the earthquake b decreased from 2555 ppb to 2475 ppb al decreased from 0 5 ppb to below the detection limit sc decreased from 11 5 ppb to 5 ppb ti decreased from 6 2 ppb to 4 8 ppb v decreased from 8 ppb to 6 ppb cr decreased from 16 6 ppb to 14 ppb rb decreased from 40 ppb to 38 ppb and cs decreased from 5 3 ppb to 4 8 ppb to determine if such post seismic changes were significant we conducted an anova analysis for each element by dividing the pre seismic and post seismic concentrations of the trace elements into two groups we conducted univariate anova analyses and the results showed that the significance between the co seismic and post seismic concentrations was less than 0 005 for all the 9 elements which supported the finding of clear changes in trace element concentrations after the earthquake however no significant differences between the pre seismic and post seismic concentration of the major ions and isotopes could be found by anova since we had no further long term post seismic data the whole post seismic recovery was difficult to recognize 5 discussion many previous studies have documented groundwater levels and chemical composition changes following earthquakes and have proposed several mechanisms to explain the responses such as the mechanisms include co seismic static strain induced dilation and compaction ge and stover 2000 liquefication or consolidation of sediments wang et al 2001 and permeability changes caused by shaking brodsky et al 2003 among these mechanisms the crustal strain dilation or aquifer permeability changes causing mixtures of different waters are usually considered to be the mechanism to explain these responses rojstaczer and wolf 1992 skelton et al 2014 woith et al 2013 however most of those mechanisms were proposed based on studies related to springs with relatively sparse sample rates and only a few studies studied both groundwater levels flow rate and their chemical variations biagi et al 2000 wang et al 2004 furthermore few studies have examined both groundwater levels and trace elements responses to earthquakes barberio et al 2017 rosen et al 2018 skelton et al 2019 for our case we found that the groundwater levels showed a co seismic increase while no changes in the major ions were seen following the august 2018 m5 0 earthquake but clear changes were found for different trace elements which is notably different from the results from the previous studies we first considered the previously proposed mechanisms for changes in chemical composition aquifer dilation compaction induced by co seismic strain or permeability changes may both cause groundwater movement if large volumes of chemically and isotopically distinct groundwater enter the wellbore and mix with the original water then some chemical compositions would show changes on the other hand the addition of additional water into the wellbore would also cause changes in water levels flow rates thus it is expected that there would be water level flow rate changes as well as changes in chemical compositions in our case we indeed observed an increase of the water level which is not related with precipitation as no rain occurred during the earthquake but we detected only small changes in the isotopes and major ion concentrations which seems inconsistent with this assumption another mechanism for the changes in chemical compositions is an increase of the reactive surface area caused by fracturing of sampled aquifers which would enhance the water rock interactions according to claesson et al 2007 the increase in reactive surface area would shift the system out of chemical and isotope equilibrium and lead to more extensive water rock interaction and increases in concentrations of some dissolved cations would be expected because the trace elements showed decreased concentrations following the earthquake this mechanism of water rock interaction enhancement is unlikely in our data only changes in the trace elements can be clearly identified following earthquakes and such observations are very different from the previous studies which always showed changes in major ions or stable isotopes since the trace elements were not commonly measured in the previous studies only a very limited number of cases could be found in these studies both the major ions and trace elements showed changes following earthquakes but the trace elements showed larger magnitudes of change than the major ions claesson et al 2007 rosen et al 2018 we need to note that different trace elements showed different co seismic responses in these two studies meaning that the sensitivity of different trace elements may depend on many factors that could affect the fluid chemistry in a specific aquifer system more trace element data are needed to provide an additional understanding of the sensitivity of different trace elements to earthquake stress in the jiangchuan aquifer system li b al sc ti v cr fe rb and cs were the elements most sensitive to earthquake stress rosen et al 2018 proposed that the changes in trace elements were likely related to the release of groundwater of different residence times from pore spaces or fractures the mechanism of the co seismic response in the jiangchuan well may be explained as follows fig 6 the shaking caused by the m5 earthquake led to a permeability change of the well aquifer system and may have broken the hydraulic barriers between the aquifers and other nearby small isolated reservoirs thereby leading to the mixing of chemically distinct water with the aquifer because the volume of water added to the system was small there would be small changes in water levels but no change or only slight changes would be expected for the major ions and isotopes for the trace elements the concentrations were usually very low and below the detection limits in many groundwater thus the trace element concentrations could change easily if there was other water with different trace element concentrations added rosen et al 2018 furthermore barberio et al 2017 found that some trace elements were very sensitive to the changes of the physical chemical environment for example a slight decrease in ph led to clear changes in v and cr concentrations it was expected that other physical chemical parameter changes would lead to changes in trace element concentrations thus the changes of trace elements in the jiangchuan well may have been the combined result of the addition of small amounts of water from the reservoirs isolated by the hydraulic barrier and the changes in the physical chemical environment following the earthquake in our case most of the trace element showed co seismic decreases less than 15 although showing relatively small changes the co seismic response was clear because of the small background variations before the earthquake however the major ions showed considerably higher larger background variations than the trace elements which made them difficult to identify with only a small amount of added of water thus it seems that trace elements have the potential to be more sensitive for detecting small changes caused by crustal strain than do the major ions a recent study of the relationship between groundwater in the jiangchuan well and surrounding surface waters e g samples collected from xingyun lake the nearby river and the surface reservoir showed that the chemical types were quite different in the jiangchuan well na hco3 with the surface waters mg ca hco3 for the river and mg ca na hco3 for the lake table 4 hu et al 2018 additionally the hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses suggested that the water in the jiangchuan wells was more negative in heavy isotopes which differed from the surface waters fig 4 these differences led us to believe that there may have been no hydraulic connection between the surface waters and the groundwater according to the borehole televiewer there was significant groundwater flow into the well at depth of 16 26 m as the screen in this part was very clean the screens at middle depths were blocked by corrosion suggesting no water flow into well from these sections hu et al 2018 thus the groundwater in these wells comes primarily from the upper screen section and from the open section in the quartz sandstone and shale after the earthquake shaking caused breakage of the hydraulic barrier s with isolated reservoirs leading to the addition of small amounts of water into the wellbore and the oxidation deoxidation environment may also have changed slightly as a result of the shaking all of these changes led to the clear changes seen in the trace elements but to no changes in the major ions thus the trace elements were expected to be more sensitive than the major ions in response to the stress strain changes notably different geological and hydrogeological settings may show different sensitivities to trace elements and which trace elements are sensitive to seismic activities is determined by the aquifer lithology and physical chemical conditions for specific sites for example another well located 25 km away from the tohai earthquake epicenter did not show any co seismic responses for both major ions and trace elements by comparing the chemical compositions of the jiangchuan and huaning wells we found large differences between them the background chemical characteristics of the huaning well showed na 80 mg l k 3 31 mg l mg2 12 2 mg l ca2 18 04 mg l cl 1 48 mg l so4 2 10 50 mg l and hco3 328 38 mg l it has a water chemical type of ca mg hco3 different from the jiangchuan well which is na hco3 additionally the trace elements in this well showed considerably lower concentrations than the jiangchuan well li 8 3 ppb b 222 8 ppb al below the detection limit sc 5 2 ppb ti 2 48 ppb v 0 15 ppb cr 5 35 ppb rb 2 54 ppb cs 0 07 ppb and as 3 21 ppb furthermore there was only one aquifer in the huaning well while multiple aquifers were present in the jiangchuan well these differences may explains why this well did not show co seismic responses more observations must be conducted before the sensitive trace elements can be determined because trace elements have not previously been commonly monitored related data are limited and a wide range of trace element data and other complementary data would likely be needed to provide useful information we suggest that those sites that are located in the transition bands of oxidation and reducing zones or that are located in multiple aquifer layer systems are more likely to show responses to crustal stress strain changes 6 conclusions in this study we documented the changes of co seismic trace elements following a m5 0 earthquake by weekly water sampling from a wellbore our study showed that trace element concentrations showed significant decreases in response to the tonghai earthquake but no significant changes occurred in major ions and hydrogen and oxygen isotope concentrations trace element behavior showed more stable background variations and was more sensitive to crustal strain on the other hand the major ions were affected by many factors and considerably larger changes of aquifer properties or large volumes of mixing would be needed to observe a clear co seismic response thus the monitoring of trace elements should be considered as a priority for studies of groundwater chemical composition related to earthquakes additionally more studies are needed to provide a complete understanding of the sensitivity of different trace elements to earthquake stress credit

cause increasing water levels fig 2 3 methods 3 1 data collection water samples were collected by the staff working at this station every 5 7 days and sample collection began in february 2018 each sample was filtered with 0 2 μm membranes on site and was stored in two 500 ml polyethylene bottles hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes were collected in 50 ml polyethylene bottles all samples were sent monthly to the china university of geoscience beijing for further analysis such sample collections continued until september 2018 and a total of 28 water samples were collected during this period all water samples were analyzed for major ions such as k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and f and for trace elements li b al sc ti v cr fe rb and cs the cl no3 so4 2 f were analyzed by means of ion chromatography dionex 900 the stable isotopes of 18o and deuterium were analyzed with a liquid water isotope analyzer lgr with an accuracy of 0 2 for 18o and an accuracy of 0 3 for d the hco3 levels were measured by a potentiometric titrator and the ca2 mg2 na and k concentrations were analyzed by icp aes and the trace elements were analyzed with a thermo fisher x series ii icp ms at the institute of crustal dynamics cea all samples were analyzed by the same staff using the same instruments during the measurements each trace element was measured at least three times and if the results showed differences less than 5 we used the average values of the measurements as the concentrations 3 2 anova analysis the anova test was used to analyze the differences among group means in a sample and it provided a statistical test to show whether two or more means were equal kleinbaum et al 1988 we used one way anova to analyze the data we grouped the data into two groups before the earthquake and after the earthquake and we compared the differences between the two groups the analysis was done with ibm spss 22 allen et al 2014 4 results on august 14th 2018 an earthquake with a magnitude of 5 0 occurred in tonghai city with an epicenteral distance of 16 6 km fig 1 the seismic energy density produced by this earthquake at the jiangchuan well was approximately 6 02 j m3 according to wang 2007 considerably larger than the minimum energy density 10 4 j m3 that is required for triggering hydrological responses based on global observations wang 2007 thus it was expected that there may have been co seismic hydrological responses following this earthquake for the jiangchuan well the groundwater level increased from 0 41 m to 0 43 m following the m5 0 earthquake next we checked if there are any changes before and after the earthquake the result of analyses of the 28 samples are listed in tables 2 and 3 from table 2 we see that the ion balances of all samples were less than 5 which indicated credible analysis results for these samples the groundwater in this well was of the na hco3 type during the study period na and k and showed a decreasing trend during the study period na decreased from 376 mg l to 364 mg l k decreased from 15 0 mg l to 13 8 mg l and mg2 decreased from 2 1 mg l to 1 9 mg l cl hco3 so4 2 and ca2 show increases and f was relatively stable figs 3a b cl increased from 100 mg l to 135 mg l hco3 increased from 700 mg l to 780 mg l so4 2 increased from 60 mg l to 72 mg l and ca2 increased from 10 mg l to 23 mg l there were some fluctuations in the major ions that occurred before the tonghai earthquake f cl and so4 2 but no clear co seismic changes were found following the earthquake for the hydrogen and oxygen isotope data we plotted all samples that were collected from the jc well and also examined the water samples from the surface water and a domestic well the deuterium and oxygen isotopes only exhibited small fluctuations during the study period fig 4 the deuterium isotope levels varied from 100 to 98 and the oxygen isotope levels varied from 13 6 to 13 no clear changes for the major ions or for the stable isotopes were found following the earthquake figs 3 4 we further checked the trace elements for this well and found that there were clear co seismic decreases in the trace elements fig 5 among 20 measured different trace element constituents nine trace elements showed large decreases following the two m5 0 earthquakes and did not recover in over a short period li decreased from 700 ppb to 660 ppb following the earthquake b decreased from 2555 ppb to 2475 ppb al decreased from 0 5 ppb to below the detection limit sc decreased from 11 5 ppb to 5 ppb ti decreased from 6 2 ppb to 4 8 ppb v decreased from 8 ppb to 6 ppb cr decreased from 16 6 ppb to 14 ppb rb decreased from 40 ppb to 38 ppb and cs decreased from 5 3 ppb to 4 8 ppb to determine if such post seismic changes were significant we conducted an anova analysis for each element by dividing the pre seismic and post seismic concentrations of the trace elements into two groups we conducted univariate anova analyses and the results showed that the significance between the co seismic and post seismic concentrations was less than 0 005 for all the 9 elements which supported the finding of clear changes in trace element concentrations after the earthquake however no significant differences between the pre seismic and post seismic concentration of the major ions and isotopes could be found by anova since we had no further long term post seismic data the whole post seismic recovery was difficult to recognize 5 discussion many previous studies have documented groundwater levels and chemical composition changes following earthquakes and have proposed several mechanisms to explain the responses such as the mechanisms include co seismic static strain induced dilation and compaction ge and stover 2000 liquefication or consolidation of sediments wang et al 2001 and permeability changes caused by shaking brodsky et al 2003 among these mechanisms the crustal strain dilation or aquifer permeability changes causing mixtures of different waters are usually considered to be the mechanism to explain these responses rojstaczer and wolf 1992 skelton et al 2014 woith et al 2013 however most of those mechanisms were proposed based on studies related to springs with relatively sparse sample rates and only a few studies studied both groundwater levels flow rate and their chemical variations biagi et al 2000 wang et al 2004 furthermore few studies have examined both groundwater levels and trace elements responses to earthquakes barberio et al 2017 rosen et al 2018 skelton et al 2019 for our case we found that the groundwater levels showed a co seismic increase while no changes in the major ions were seen following the august 2018 m5 0 earthquake but clear changes were found for different trace elements which is notably different from the results from the previous studies we first considered the previously proposed mechanisms for changes in chemical composition aquifer dilation compaction induced by co seismic strain or permeability changes may both cause groundwater movement if large volumes of chemically and isotopically distinct groundwater enter the wellbore and mix with the original water then some chemical compositions would show changes on the other hand the addition of additional water into the wellbore would also cause changes in water levels flow rates thus it is expected that there would be water level flow rate changes as well as changes in chemical compositions in our case we indeed observed an increase of the water level which is not related with precipitation as no rain occurred during the earthquake but we detected only small changes in the isotopes and major ion concentrations which seems inconsistent with this assumption another mechanism for the changes in chemical compositions is an increase of the reactive surface area caused by fracturing of sampled aquifers which would enhance the water rock interactions according to claesson et al 2007 the increase in reactive surface area would shift the system out of chemical and isotope equilibrium and lead to more extensive water rock interaction and increases in concentrations of some dissolved cations would be expected because the trace elements showed decreased concentrations following the earthquake this mechanism of water rock interaction enhancement is unlikely in our data only changes in the trace elements can be clearly identified following earthquakes and such observations are very different from the previous studies which always showed changes in major ions or stable isotopes since the trace elements were not commonly measured in the previous studies only a very limited number of cases could be found in these studies both the major ions and trace elements showed changes following earthquakes but the trace elements showed larger magnitudes of change than the major ions claesson et al 2007 rosen et al 2018 we need to note that different trace elements showed different co seismic responses in these two studies meaning that the sensitivity of different trace elements may depend on many factors that could affect the fluid chemistry in a specific aquifer system more trace element data are needed to provide an additional understanding of the sensitivity of different trace elements to earthquake stress in the jiangchuan aquifer system li b al sc ti v cr fe rb and cs were the elements most sensitive to earthquake stress rosen et al 2018 proposed that the changes in trace elements were likely related to the release of groundwater of different residence times from pore spaces or fractures the mechanism of the co seismic response in the jiangchuan well may be explained as follows fig 6 the shaking caused by the m5 earthquake led to a permeability change of the well aquifer system and may have broken the hydraulic barriers between the aquifers and other nearby small isolated reservoirs thereby leading to the mixing of chemically distinct water with the aquifer because the volume of water added to the system was small there would be small changes in water levels but no change or only slight changes would be expected for the major ions and isotopes for the trace elements the concentrations were usually very low and below the detection limits in many groundwater thus the trace element concentrations could change easily if there was other water with different trace element concentrations added rosen et al 2018 furthermore barberio et al 2017 found that some trace elements were very sensitive to the changes of the physical chemical environment for example a slight decrease in ph led to clear changes in v and cr concentrations it was expected that other physical chemical parameter changes would lead to changes in trace element concentrations thus the changes of trace elements in the jiangchuan well may have been the combined result of the addition of small amounts of water from the reservoirs isolated by the hydraulic barrier and the changes in the physical chemical environment following the earthquake in our case most of the trace element showed co seismic decreases less than 15 although showing relatively small changes the co seismic response was clear because of the small background variations before the earthquake however the major ions showed considerably higher larger background variations than the trace elements which made them difficult to identify with only a small amount of added of water thus it seems that trace elements have the potential to be more sensitive for detecting small changes caused by crustal strain than do the major ions a recent study of the relationship between groundwater in the jiangchuan well and surrounding surface waters e g samples collected from xingyun lake the nearby river and the surface reservoir showed that the chemical types were quite different in the jiangchuan well na hco3 with the surface waters mg ca hco3 for the river and mg ca na hco3 for the lake table 4 hu et al 2018 additionally the hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses suggested that the water in the jiangchuan wells was more negative in heavy isotopes which differed from the surface waters fig 4 these differences led us to believe that there may have been no hydraulic connection between the surface waters and the groundwater according to the borehole televiewer there was significant groundwater flow into the well at depth of 16 26 m as the screen in this part was very clean the screens at middle depths were blocked by corrosion suggesting no water flow into well from these sections hu et al 2018 thus the groundwater in these wells comes primarily from the upper screen section and from the open section in the quartz sandstone and shale after the earthquake shaking caused breakage of the hydraulic barrier s with isolated reservoirs leading to the addition of small amounts of water into the wellbore and the oxidation deoxidation environment may also have changed slightly as a result of the shaking all of these changes led to the clear changes seen in the trace elements but to no changes in the major ions thus the trace elements were expected to be more sensitive than the major ions in response to the stress strain changes notably different geological and hydrogeological settings may show different sensitivities to trace elements and which trace elements are sensitive to seismic activities is determined by the aquifer lithology and physical chemical conditions for specific sites for example another well located 25 km away from the tohai earthquake epicenter did not show any co seismic responses for both major ions and trace elements by comparing the chemical compositions of the jiangchuan and huaning wells we found large differences between them the background chemical characteristics of the huaning well showed na 80 mg l k 3 31 mg l mg2 12 2 mg l ca2 18 04 mg l cl 1 48 mg l so4 2 10 50 mg l and hco3 328 38 mg l it has a water chemical type of ca mg hco3 different from the jiangchuan well which is na hco3 additionally the trace elements in this well showed considerably lower concentrations than the jiangchuan well li 8 3 ppb b 222 8 ppb al below the detection limit sc 5 2 ppb ti 2 48 ppb v 0 15 ppb cr 5 35 ppb rb 2 54 ppb cs 0 07 ppb and as 3 21 ppb furthermore there was only one aquifer in the huaning well while multiple aquifers were present in the jiangchuan well these differences may explains why this well did not show co seismic responses more observations must be conducted before the sensitive trace elements can be determined because trace elements have not previously been commonly monitored related data are limited and a wide range of trace element data and other complementary data would likely be needed to provide useful information we suggest that those sites that are located in the transition bands of oxidation and reducing zones or that are located in multiple aquifer layer systems are more likely to show responses to crustal stress strain changes 6 conclusions in this study we documented the changes of co seismic trace elements following a m5 0 earthquake by weekly water sampling from a wellbore our study showed that trace element concentrations showed significant decreases in response to the tonghai earthquake but no significant changes occurred in major ions and hydrogen and oxygen isotope concentrations trace element behavior showed more stable background variations and was more sensitive to crustal strain on the other hand the major ions were affected by many factors and considerably larger changes of aquifer properties or large volumes of mixing would be needed to observe a clear co seismic response thus the monitoring of trace elements should be considered as a priority for studies of groundwater chemical composition related to earthquakes additionally more studies are needed to provide a complete understanding of the sensitivity of different trace elements to earthquake stress credit

5902,efficient estimation of reference evapotranspiration et0 becomes necessary for water resources management and irrigation practices despite research advancement in the recent decades results inconsistencies have been reported related to chaotic stochastic and black box approaches for multi step ahead prediction of et0 this study aimed at applying ensemble approaches to improve single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 to do so several artificial intelligence ai based techniques including support vector regression svr adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis artificial neural network ann and multiple linear regression mlr models were employed for one two and three steps ahead predictions of et0 for numerous climatic stations in iraq north cyprus and turkey monthly meteorological parameters were used as inputs for the models development finally two linear ensemble methods simple averaging and weighted averaging and a nonlinear ensemble method neural ensemble were applied for the single models performance and reliability improvements the results showed superior performance of ai based models with regard to the mlr model in addition promising improvements were achieved in single and multi step ahead et0 modeling by the application of the ensemble models the overall results revealed that the ensemble models proposed in this study could lead to increase in single models performance in the validation phase up to 60 33 and 24 for turkey north cyprus and iraq stations respectively keywords reference evapotranspiration ensemble models artificial intelligence artificial neural network pan evaporation 1 introduction water deficiency especially in arid and semi arid environments is becoming a problem that needs considerable attention for crop productions soil water balance and effective water resources management in such water scarce regions reference evapotranspiration et0 estimation with reliable accuracy is significant in hydro climatic studies the history that relates meteorological variables to evapotranspiration et can be traced back to early 19th century henceforth according to chen et al 2005 six categories of methods have been developed including 1 mass transfer methods for example shiri 2018 improved mass transfer based et0 estimation approaches through wavelet random forest methodology 2 pan evaporation methods 3 combination methods 4 temperature based methods 5 water budget methods and 6 radiation based methods for example shiri 2019a used mass transfer temperature radiation based et0 equations and a heuristic model to access the practical implications of et0 modeling in island environments the method of pan evaporation ep has been proven to be of practical value and consequently its application relating et0 to ep with empirical coefficients has been widely adopted for longer or 10 days period allen et al 1998 the aggregate effects of temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed on the et0 are provided by measurements from ep ep measurements of reasonable accuracy could successfully be used to achieve estimation of et0 as demonstrated by several studies efficient correlation between et0 and ep is expected to be seen when ep is properly adjusted khoob 2008 despite the reliability of conceptual and physical based models in examining the precise physics of a phenomenon they exhibit practical constraints and when physical understanding is of less significance than accurate predictions application of black box models can be helpful nourani et al 2019a multiple linear regression mlr is a linear conventional technique that measures the degree of relationship between dependent and one or multiple independent variables tabari et al 2012 toward modeling processes such kinds of linear basic models lose perfection in several areas subjected to nonlinearity dynamism and high complexity in temporal as well as in spatial scales recently methods of artificial intelligence ai have shown high performance accuracy for estimating et0 shiri et al 2019a for instance support vector regression svr adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and artificial neural network ann are of wider adaptation which yielded the publication of several articles in hydro climatic processes shiri 2019b applied neural networks and neuro fuzzy techniques for pan evaporation modeling in low altitude locations for et0 process kumar et al 2002 developed ann model for the estimation of et0 sudheer et al 2003 applied ann model using climate data of restricted limited amount to model et0 kisi 2006 employed generalized regression and feed forward neural networks grnn and ffnn for daily et0 estimation kisi and kilic 2016 evaluated ann and m5 model tree generalization capability for et0 modeling ann and empirical equations were applied by antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 using limited climate variables for daily et0 estimation anfis model has also been applied in many studies related to et0 modeling including kisi and oztürk 2007 study karimaldini et al 2011 investigated the potential of anfis in daily et0 modeling under arid climate using limited amount of climate variables mohammadrezapour et al 2019 applied anfis and other two ai models for potential evapotranspiration modeling in arid climate amiri et al 2019 applied fuzzy regression method under controlled environment to estimate et0 based on support vector machine svm concept the svr model as more recent emerging ai algorithm has fewer studies in technical literature for instance the application of svm to estimate daily et0 was evaluated by wen et al 2015 using combination of several meteorological inputs including wind speed solar radiation minimum and maximum temperature in the arid region of ejina basin china the reliability of svm and other ai models were investigated by fan et al 2018 to estimate daily et0 ferreira et al 2019 employed svm and ann models in a new approach to predict et0 using limited climate data shiri et al 2019b applied svm and 11 other soft computing approaches for et0 modeling in humid locations even though a quite reliable and accurate results might be achieved by the application of the ai based and mlr models for examples et0 studies by kisi and oztürk 2007 tabari et al 2012 wen et al 2015 amiri et al 2019 shiri et al 2019a it is apparent that different outcomes may be accomplished by different models for a particular problem therefore bates and granger 1969 study revealed that an amalgamation of several techniques would lead to results with minimal error variance whereas individual techniques would lead to larger error results combining several single models has become a general practice for accuracy improvement makridakis et al 1982 the idea behind model ensemble is to harness the exclusive characteristics of the single models in a unique framework which would lead to improvement of the modeling accuracy kiran and ravi 2008 in the hydro climatic processes in general and et0 modeling context in particular an up to date review of the literature shows that so far no study was done with the application of several ai based techniques for multi step ahead ensemble modeling therefore the main targets of this study are to perform multi step ahead modeling study of et0 in ten meteorological stations including samsun izmir adana ankara stations from turkey nicosia morphou kyrenia famagusta stations from north cyprus and erbil salahaddin stations from iraq and finally to employ the learning concept of ensemble techniques to improve predictions of the single models two steps were involved in the et0 modeling i ffnn commonly used ai model anfis which utilizes fuzzy concept to handle uncertainty of process svr most recent ai model and mlr a classical linear approach models were applied for multi step ahead et0 predictions ii thereafter the outputs of the individual models were used as inputs to weighted average simple average and neural ensemble wa sa ne approaches for accuracy enhancement other methods of ensemble modeling can also be applied as demonstrated by kiran and ravi 2008 however the advantages of adopting these particular approaches over others in this study are sa is simple to use and does not require complex procedure in its application wa uses weights which are not generated randomly rather based on relative significance of single models thereby improving performance and ne uses nonlinear kernel to simulate the system s behavior hence using the 3 ensemble approaches the linear and nonlinear aspects of et0 could be appropriately monitored it should be noted that this study is a follow up to nourani et al 2019a study whereby for the first time ensemble approaches were applied to model et0 in several climatic regions due to complexity involved whereby the forecasting accuracy decreases with increase in prediction horizon such as in karbasi 2018 study and owing to lagging and weak markovian process of the input data multi step ahead prediction of et0 is difficult to achieve nevertheless the results of nourani et al 2019a study show a tremendous contribution of ensemble learning towards et0 modeling by increasing prediction up to 22 for strategy 1 which are black box models over single modeling this necessitates the application of ensemble techniques in this study to verify whether the techniques can also be employed successfully to improve multi step ahead prediction of et0 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and data in this study ten stations from turkey nc and iraq representing different climatic regions were used for single and multi step ahead et0 modeling thus the study locations are described in accordance to the regions or countries of the study 2 1 1 turkey stations turkey is a transcontinental country located predominantly in asia see fig 1 certain area of its land enters portion on the balkan peninsula which is located in the southeast europe sea of marmara separated anatolia with europe s east thrace turkey is bordered by georgia to its northeast bulgaria and greece to its northwest iran azerbaijan exclave of nakhchivan and armenia to the east syria and iraq to the south turkish geographical area is covered between latitudes 360 and 420n and longitudes 260 and 450 e due to large inland plateau surrounded by rough topographical terrain of anatolia peninsula variation of temperature in the region is high the maximum temperature recorded at sanliurfa station is 46 8 c in the southeast while minimum temperature at agri station recorded as 42 8 c in the northeast pan evaporation varies annually between 435 and 2 800 mm year turkish annual average precipitation is 643 mm year citakoglu et al 2014 using seasonality index and total seasonal rainfall percentage ratio to the annual amount seven climatic regions in turkey were formed including continental eastern anatolia cean continental central anatolia ccan mediterranean to central anatolia transition medt continental mediterranean cmed mediterranean med marmara mediterranean to black sea transition mrt and black sea bls turkes 1996 adana station constitutes subtropical semi humid and humid climates in the med region characterized by heavy rainy and cool winter with a hot dry summer ankara station is situated in a semi arid steppe of continental central anatolia ccan region the climate of the station is comprised of cool rainy spring warm and light rainy summer and cold rainy winter izmir station is in med region and thereby shares same climate characteristics as adana station samsun station is a temperate climate located in the black sea bls region it is a consistently rainy climate with its peak in autumn table 1 gives data statistics coordinates and locations of turkey stations as demonstrated in table 1 ankara and samsun stations have fewer pr values compared to adana and izmir stations this could be due to partly semi humid and humid nature of the climate of the med region where adana and izmir stations are located ankara is a semi arid climate in the ccan region which has fewer rainfall in comparison to semi humid or humid climate while samsun is bls temperate climate moreover increase in aridity leads to decrease in precipitation which could be why ankara has a bit less precipitation than samsun nonetheless table 1 also revealed that the moderate nature of bls climate ensures the fall of tmin and tmax values within the range of other stations under study for data statistics of the samsun station 2 1 2 north cyprus stations north cyprus nc is the eastern mediterranean s third largest island and its climate is typically mediterranean with mild wet winters and hot dry summers rainfall occurrence mostly is between november to march as a whole the island annual average precipitation is 500 mm the highest point of the trodos mountain has an average of 1200 mm rainfall while at the central plain it is around 300 400 mm elkiran and ergil 2006 average temperature in nc falls between 5 and 15 0c in the first month of the year january and rises higher in july however according to class a pan reading annual evaporation reaches up to 2200 mm year recent research showed that through evapotranspiration about 80 of rainfall water returns to the atmosphere elkiran and ongul 2009 this study involves the use of data from four meteorological stations in north cyprus famagusta has a temperate and warm climate it has annual average rainfall of about 407 mm and 19 3 c average temperature kyrenia has hilly areas with about 500 mm 750 mm average rainfall falling particularly in winter and rarely in summer the coldest month in kyrenia station is january with an average temperature of about 10 c while july is the hottest month with an average temperature of about 29 c the highest rainfall range owing to altitude falls within 750 mm to 1110 mm in the kyrenia mountains morphou has a local steppe climate little rainfall is experienced in morphou in the whole year with about 363 mm annual precipitation fall and 18 5 c annual average temperature being an inland city located at the center of north cyprus the mediterranean sea effect is less in nicosia compared to the other cities located in the seacoast hence nicosia experience colder winters and hotter summers than the other coastal areas also day maximum and night minimum temperatures difference is large for july and august the hottest months the daytime temperatures difference between other cities and nicosia is about 4 c to 7 c in january and february the coldest months nicosia has about 2 c to 3 c daytime temperature difference less than on the coast table 2 gives data statistics coordinates and locations of north cyprus stations with dry hot summer and relatively mild or cool winter mediterranean climate high medium and low temperatures were observed as seen in table 2 nicosia has maximum pan evaporation value of 12 6 mm day whereas its minimum values for all the stations in north cyprus are 1 1 mm day 1 11 mm day 0 9 mm day and 1 1 mm day for nicosia morphou kyrenia and famagusta stations respectively relative humidity values are close due to the vicinity of the stations with maximum difference of 4 75 between morphou and famagusta stations and minimum difference of 1 99 between morphou and nicosia stations the lowest and the highest range of dew point temperatures are between 4 65 c 22 24 c 2 1 3 iraq stations iraq is historically called mesopotamia located in western asia fig 1 iraq population is about 37 2 million in 2016 and it has an area of land that covers 437 072 km2 iraq is bordered by 6 countries including jordan saudi arabia turkey kuwait syria and iran the longitudes and latitudes of iraq are between 38 45 and 48 45 e and 29 5 and 37 22 n nourani et al 2019a b with respect to rasul et al 2015 erbil is a city situated in northern iraq and is the capital of kurdistan erbil is situated within continental and semi arid climate it winter seasons are cool and rainy while summer seasons are warm and dry salahaddin is also a city located in kurdistan region of iraq the station is characterized by semi arid climate as reported by sarlak and agha 2018 study table 3 gives data statistics coordinates and locations of iraq stations erbil and salahaddin stations exhibit similar statistics due to their semi arid climate proximity as shown in table 3 erbil is less humid which results in lower relative humidity than salahaddin salahaddin station has tmax as high as 39 9 0c and as low as 0 0c while erbil station with the existence of hot semi arid climate has the highest tmax of 6 19 0c and 44 03 0c for the minimum and maximum values respectively the stations and regions of the study are shown in fig 1 the study data were obtained from the respective meteorological organizations of turkey north cyprus and iraq the data were divided into two sets 75 for training and 25 for validation table 4 illustrates information regarding the used datasets to ensure all variables received equal attention and to have dimensionless peculiarity during model training ai based modeling usually involves data normalization nourani et al 2012 two main benefits can be attributed to data normalization before exploiting ai based approaches for predictions the first is given smaller numeric ranges the ability to compete so as not to be overshadowed by bigger numeric ranges secondly numerical difficulties while calculation are also avoided with data normalization data normalization in this study was performed so as the values fall between 0 and 1 scale for efficiency and performance analysis of the models several globally accepted statistical indicators can be used including mean absolute

ghorbani et al 2018 nevertheless according to legates and mccabe 1999 rmse and nse are sufficient for any hydro climatic modeling and are therefore employed in this study as the models performance

becomes large the rmse increases through large positive values for perfect forecasts from zero understandably rmse value towards 0 and high nse value towards 1 nse 1 signify model with high reliability 2 2 proposed methodology this study assessed the feasibility of applying the concept of ensemble learning for ai based and mlr models performance improvement for single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 initially one two and three step ahead models were developed by three ai based and mlr techniques finally the proposed ensemble modeling was carried out using the outputs produced by the single models the fundamental notion behind model ensemble is owing to the following i most of the times in practice it is difficult to determine for a time series under study if the underlying process is induced by a nonlinear or linear circumstance or whether the application of one model or a particular method yields better results than others consequently selection of the best technique or choosing the best befitting method is a difficult task before the predictors for a unique issue therefore the problem arises while selecting the appropriate model could be handled by the application of ensemble learning sharghi et al 2018 ii both linear and non linear characteristics may be involved in time series predictions for a real world process neither mlr nor ai could be satisfactory in such situation for the time series prediction as non linear relationship cannot be handled by mlr model whereas ai models could magnify errors of a linear pattern thus the data complex stochastic nature could be grabbed more appropriately by combination of mlr and ai models iii as revealed by previous studies such as sharghi et al 2018 nourani et al 2019a there is no specific method or a unique model that can completely examine a process the complex and uncertain nature of real world problem could be largely the cause whereby distinct patterns of the process might not be detected accurately by a unique model the proposed study methodology is shown in fig 2 to have a proper comparison of the computed et0 over the study regions same methodology given in fig 2 was used for all stations 10 stations from turkey north cyprus and iraq the next sub sections present details of the used tools and components of the models 2 3 artificial neural network ann ann is a convincing ai technique that is capable of handling enormous amount of dynamism nonlinear and noisy data especially when the physical underlying relationships are not completely understood this confirms ann as an appropriate time series modeling data driven tool nourani et al 2015 ann constitutes a number of simple interconnected processing elements known as nodes or neurons with fascinating peculiarity of information processing characteristics such as noise tolerance nonlinearity generalization capability parallelism and learning for providing solutions to many engineering problems among the methods of neural networks ffnn with back propagation bp algorithm are the most common applied methods hornik et al 1989 the ffnn technique is composed of parallel processing element layers known as neuron and every layer is being connected fully by weights to the proceeding layer generally those anns learning are accomplished by bp algorithm hornik et al 1989 among many training algorithms of ann in this study levenberg marquardt lm was preferred selection due to its fast convergence ability as affirmed by sahoo et al 2005 lm algorithm is a hybrid technique which utilizes both steepest descent and gauss newton to converge to an optimal solution to solve a wider range problems the hybrid approach usually used to trade off the best characteristics of different algorithms for instance if the initial guess is relatively close to the optimal solution gauss newton approach is faster as such utilized by lm algorithm in a contrary situation the lm algorithm uses the aspect of steepest descent approach to traverse the design space and find a potential solution area and then find the optimum for solving systems of nonlinear equations this technique is particularly effective wilson and mantooth 2013 meanwhile for both output and hidden layers the transfer function applied was tangent sigmoid tansig besides trial and error process was employed to ensure optimum number of hidden layer neurons and to determine the calibration epochs fig 3 shows the three layered ffnn structure 2 4 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis in the literature of neural network nn neuro fuzzy modeling refers to fuzzy modeling approaches which involve the application of distinctive learning algorithm to fuzzy inference system fis a peculiar approach in the neuro fuzzy development is anfis which utilize nn learning algorithm and was first introduced by jang 1993 fuzzy database fuzzifier and defuzzifier are the three major parts that are constituted in every fuzzy system nourani and komasi 2013 nourani et al 2015 the two fundamental parts of fuzzy database are fuzzy rule base and inference engine fuzzy rule base comprises fuzzy propositions related rules that are revealed by jang et al 1997 hence operation analysis is applied in fuzzy inference the two most famous fuzzy inference engine are sugeno and mamdani which both could be employed to achieve a desired goal anfis as a universal approximator has the ability of impacting accuracy for all real continuous functions to a higher degree anfis is functionally equal to fis as stated by jang et al 1997 here anfis system is specifically equivalent to the first order sugeno fuzzy model jang et al 1997 fig 4 gives the general structure of anfis as displayed by fig 4 x and y are considered to be inputs of the anfis and ƒ is the output the first order sugeno fuzzy model constitutes two fuzzy if then sets of rules given by 3 rule 1 if μ x is a 1 and μ y is b 1 thef 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 4 rule 2 if μ x is a 2 and μ y is b 2 thef 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 in which a 1 and a 2 are x inputs mfs b 1 and b 2 are y inputs mfs respectively while the output function parameters are p 1 q 1 r 1 and p 2 q 2 r 2 the functions of each anfis layer are as follows layer 1 in this layer each node produced an input variable membership grades q i k donates k layer i th node output assuming as the membership function mf of a generalized bell function gbellmf the output q i 1 can be obtain from jang and sun 1995 as 5 q i 1 μ a i x 1 1 x c i a i 2 b i where a i b i c i represent adaptable variables which are called premise parameters layer 2 the incoming signals are multiplied by each node in this layer as 6 q i 2 w i μ a i x μ b i y i 1 2 layer 3 in this layer the i th node calculated the normalized firing strength 7 q i 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 layer 4 in this layer node i calculated the contribution given by the i th rule to the model output 8 q i 4 w i p i x p i y r i w i f i where p 1 q 1 r 1 is the perimeter set w i is the layer 3 output layer 5 in this layer single node is used to calculate the overall output of the anfis jang and sun 1995 9 q i 5 i w i f i i w i f i i w i combination of gradient descent and least squares methods formed a hybrid anfis learning algorithm the optimization parameters are a i b i c i which are the premise parameters while the consequent parameters are p i q i r i towards forward pass in the approach of the hybrid learning until layer 4 the consequent parameter is identified by the least square technique and the node output goes forward fig 4 in the backward pass the error signals propagate backward and the premise parameters are updated by the gradient descent nourani and komasi 2013 2 5 support vector regression svr based on svm concept the svr model was developed to be used for non linear regression issues contrary to several other black box forecasting methods svr as one of the svm based methods consider operational risk as the objective function to be minimized instead of minimizing the error between computed and observed values in svr at first a linear regression is fitted on the data and then the outputs go through a non linear kernel to catch the non linear pattern of the data given a set of training data x i d i i n di is the actual value xi represents the input vector and n is the data number the svr function is generally given as wang et al 2013 10 y f x w φ x i b where φ xi is mapped non linearly from input vector which indicates feature spaces by minimizing the objective function and assigning positive values for the slack parameters of ξ and ξ regression parameters b and w may be determined wang et al 2013 m i n i m i z e 1 2 w 2 c i n ξ i ξ i s u b j e c t t o w i φ x i b i d i ε ξ i d i w i φ x i b i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i i 1 2 n where 1 2 w 2 implies weights vector norm and c represents regularized constant which determine the arrangement between the regularized term and the empirical error ε is the tube size which is equivalent to accuracy approximation positioned within the training data points by defining lagrange multipliers αi and αi dual quadratic optimization problem could be resulted from the mentioned optimization problem after dealing with the quadratic optimization problem vector w can be determined as wang et al 2013 11 w i 1 n α i α i φ x i finally svr is given as wang et al 2013 12 f x α i α i i 1 n α i α i k x x i b k xi xj is the kernel function into feature space which performs the non linear mapping and b is bias term gaussian radial basis function rbf is the one commonly used kernel function given as 13 k x 1 x 2 e x p γ x 1 x 2 2 where γ is the kernel parameter 2 6 multiple linear regression multiple linear regression mlr is a classical technique that mathematically modeled the linear relationship that exists between dependent and predictor variables in general the n predictor variables and y dependent variable may have relation via nourani et al 2019a 14 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 3 x 3 b i x i ξ where x i represents the the i th predictor value b 0 is the constant of regression and b i is the the i th predictor coefficient and ξ represents the error term 2 7 multi step ahead predictions multi step ahead predictions are the predictions of parameters for some future time steps i e φ n h with h 1 2 3 h while h is the integer having value greater than one in view of the current and previous observations i e φ t t 1 2 3 n multi step ahead modeling is good for decision making and could be used to provide warning and counter measures for the persistent climate change impact on hydro climatic processes such as et0 iterated and direct algorithms are the two most commonly applied methods for the multi step ahead modeling bao et al 2014 for iterated algorithm a prediction model is constructed by minimizing the squares of one step ahead residual thereafter the predicted values are used as inputs to predict the next values in direct algorithm prediction models are constructed for each horizon by applying only its past observations bao et al 2014 in this study direct algorithm was employed since the next step is independent of the previous step and there is susceptibility of error accumulation problem for iterated algorithm as it uses past predicted values to generate next step ahead prediction 2 8 ensemble modeling it is an apparent issue that for a particular set of data one intelligent technique may provide superior performance than another similarly by applying same method to a different dataset the latter results may contradict the former in order not to lose generality and also to enjoy the mutual advantages of all the applied techniques an ensemble model is developed which provides the collective benefits by utilizing the outputs of all the single techniques with each technique being assigned certain degree of priority and then the output is provided by the help of an arbitrator kiran and ravi 2008 according to kiran and ravi 2008 the methods for ensemble learning are classified as i linear ensemble methods include weighted median simple averaging and weighted averaging ii nonlinear ensemble method using a nonlinear approach to perform ensemble modeling for example training ann with an ensemble approach linear and nonlinear ensemble modeling were applied in this study via simple averaging weighted averaging and ffnn ensemble methods simple averaging sa is conducted through the following expression 15 et 1 n i 1 n et i where et is the simple average ensemble output et i is the ith single model output and n is the total number of the single models used for this study n is equal to 4 the weighted averaging wa ensemble is done via 16 et i 1 n w i e t i where w i is the weight applied on the i th model output determined based on the model performance expressed as 17 w i nse i i 1 n nse i nsei is called the determination coefficient which determines performance efficiency of the ith single model ffnn anfis svr and mlr individual outputs in the nonlinear ensemble ne approach are combined together as new inputs to the nonlinear model ffnn is selected in this study as the nonlinear model to obtain the overall ensemble output fig 5 describes the general ensemble procedure 3 results and discussion this study was conducted in two steps the first step involves the application of ffnn anfis svr and mlr models for one three step ahead predictions of et0 in the second step linear and nonlinear ensemble modeling was carried out for the assessment of performance improvement of the single models hence the results obtained are presented accordingly 3 1 results of one and multi step ahead predictions via single models for single and multi step ahead predictions the three ai based and mlr approaches were applied for the et0 prediction for better forecasting precision the 12 input parameters were subjected to several time lags up to 12 months to check for markovian strength of the parameters and to ensure that the seasonality of the process is covered the results showed that ep and rs have strong markov chain while tmean tmin tmax td rh pr umin umax umean and sp are weak in markovian process implying that for ep and rs the next step ahead et0 values are dependent on sequence of previous events whereas for tmean tmin tmax td rh pr umin umax umean and sp et0 values for the next step are dependent only on its current values this could be because of the strong correlation that exists between ep and rs for determination of et0 which keeps their bonding together despite lagging in time owing to this development several input combinations were formed for the single and multi step ahead predictions containing only the time lags for ep and rs as 18 et 0 t h f r s e p e p t 1 e p t 12 r s t 1 r s t 12 where et 0 t h is the predicted values for single and multi step ahead et0 h 1 2 3 t 1 t 12 are monthly time lags r s e p have been previously defined the ffnn was trained using levenberg marquardt algorithm with sole hidden layer and varied hidden neurons number for the simulation of et0 to ascertain the suitable hidden layer nodes optimal number for each region trial and error approach was adopted for the anfis model in this study sugeno type fuzzy inference algorithm was used which via hybrid optimization algorithm a given input output dataset calibrated the membership function parameters for the development of anfis model structure and to determine the best anfis construction trial and error procedure was also applied gaussian shaped triangular and trapezoidal membership functions mfs were used across all stations due to their suitability in the simulation of et0 for most optimum performance the training epochs were modified rbf was used as the kernel for the creation of svr models for the entire study stations the two sigmoid and polynomial kernels tuning parameters are more than that of the rbf kernel the rbf kernel considering smoothness assumptions also shows better svr modeling performance sharghi et al 2018 for efficient reliable and best et0 modeling performance in the study stations the svr parameters were tuned using rbf kernel finally this study also employs the application of mlr model which linearly expresses the relationship between independent and dependent variables tables 5 7 present the obtained results for the best performing ffnn anfis svr and mlr models across the study stations it is worth mentioning that only the best output results of the applied models are given x y z for ffnn model structure mean the number of inputs used for the model development hidden neurons number and the et0 output mf x imply type and number of mfs used for anfis structure for svr model rbf represents the kernel function applied for svr construction for mlr model the structure x y describe the input and output number of parameters used 3 1 1 results for turkey stations with different climate conditions the results for turkey stations differ with location and time step prediction table 5 shows the results of the single and multi step ahead modeling of et0 for turkey stations the results in table 5 show that the efficiency of the models to predict et0 decreases with increased step ahead implying that the correlation between the inputs and output decreases as precedence horizon goes on which weakens the markovian characteristic of the inputs on output thereby lessening the models performances the results also demonstrated the superiority in performance of ai models over mlr model whereby the ai models produced better performances across all of the modeling steps which could be due to the inability of mlr model to deal with nonlinear behavior of the system drastic reduction in the performance and increase in error of mlr model could also be noticed which make it difficult to cope with future forecast of et0 for example considering ankara station the nse and rmse in the validation phase for single step ahead are 0 5490 and 0 1696 while the nse and rmse in the validation phase for three step ahead are 0 1765 and 0 2291 the results in table 5 also show that the performances of the ai and mlr models in term of lower rmse and higher nse in adana station are better than in samsun station across all steps of the modeling this could be attributed to higher amount of precipitation received by the med climate and based on water cycle concept frequent evapotranspiration lead to condensation and eventual precipitation this demonstrates that ai models estimate evapotranspiration easier when there is higher frequency of precipitation however as a temperate bls climate station samsun may possess higher fluctuation of et0 which its complexity might lead to inefficiency and error accumulation that could reduce the accuracy of the ai models the obtained results also show superior performance of ankara station over samsun station for the applied models this is because ankara station has semi arid climate being located in ccan environment whereas samsun station constitutes temperate climate of bls region and ai models were developed to provide efficient predictions where empirical models fail to have accurate predictions due to severe climate condition more specifically arid and semi arid climates hence ai models may not produce peak performance in predicting et0 for stations with less extremity of climate in view of the results in table 5 it can be seen that both ai and mlr models provided lesser performances for samsun station in comparison to other stations in all three steps of et0 predictions the least performance among ai models is for svr model in samsun station for three step ahead et0 prediction which has nse 0 2932 and rmse 0 2243 this reveals that ai and mlr models performances are affected negatively by the bls temperate climate of samsun station but the threat caused by the region climate can be resisted by ai based models which across all modeling steps provided efficient performance owing to their nonlinear nature and capability to overcome the uncertainty of the climate behavior moreover despite the robustness of the ai based models and their ability to provide efficient and dependable results for bls climate region other stations have superior performances than samsun station this implies that even with the application of ai based models in such region reliable results could be produced but not at the peak the overall results of the stations located in turkey show that et0 modeling is affected by the climate of the regions with the least models performance from bls region followed by ccan region and best performance was achieved in med region fig 6 shows observed vs predicted scatter plots in the validation phase for the best performing anfis model for turkey stations 3 1 2 results for north cyprus stations table 6 shows the models performances for single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 for north cyprus stations more accurate and reliability estimates of et0 are provided by ai based models in comparison to linear models among the applied models for one step ahead modeling the mlr models yielded acceptable results based on the performance evaluation criteria applied for the et0 prediction in both training and validation phases nevertheless with further predictions ahead mlr models failed to give reliable performance especially in the validation phase this could be because mlr model generates more error with further predictions ahead due to the presence of nonlinear behavior of et0 in addition as mlr modeled the linear relationship between et0 and other input variables lag in time could seem like breaking the linear chain between the inputs and output which resulted in inaccurate results hence the higher the lags the wider the linear relation and thus the decrease in mlr performance it is apparent from the results shown in table 6 that both ai and mlr models produced better results for famagusta station for single step ahead prediction compared to their performances in other stations but provided better predictions for two and three step ahead predictions in kyrenia station the better performance of mlr model in famagusta station could be due to the effect of the input combination applied so that the data for the station behave more linear which led to less error and better efficiency than the other stations but magnified with further predictions ahead moreover the relationship between previous and current et0 might be stronger in kyrenia station in such a way that previous months lags might not result in significant difference to the current and future et0 kyrenia on the other hand has unique characteristics among the stations the hills and valley nature of its terrain the presence of rocks surrounding the region higher precipitation frequency etc these could strengthen the bond between previous and future et0 despite the reduction in performance due to increase in error and uncertainty for future et0 prediction the performances of all the ai based models are found to be promising across the study stations which could be attributed to their capability of containing the complex et0 process considering single step ahead predictions anfis achieved better predictions in both training and validation phases for famagusta and morphou stations with nse 0 7942 rmse 0 1225 and nse 0 7720 rmse 0 1249 for famagusta nse 0 7839 rmse 0 1404 and nse 0 7382 rmse 0 1442 for morphou in the training and validation phases respectively in the validation phase of kyrenia station svr was found to have inferior performance compared to anfis by 2 but produced better results in the training phase in nicosia station also higher prediction accuracy was demonstrated by svr model over anfis and ffnn models the efficient performance of the anfis in famagusta morphou and kyrenia in the validation phase despite ann s ability of handling various real world problems may likely be associated with the ann shortcomings in dealing with less accurate and uncertain data consequently with incorporation of fuzzy logic ability and neural network concept for handing uncertainty of a process the better option might be anfis moghaddamnia et al 2009 table 6 also shows the multi step ahead time series predictions for two and three step ahead with the implementation of machine learning models such as neural networks more robust and more reliable performances were achieved despite increase in time lags and 3 ai models ffnn anfis and svr were found to have promising performances by maintaining good generalization capability up to three step ahead in contrast mlr model performance was relatively poor for further time step ahead the underperformance of mlr could be because a most time series data contain nonlinear property and mlr being a linear model could not cope with a nonlinear process b it is difficult to achieve multi step ahead prediction successfully with a linear model due to lack of real data to adjust the performance of the model for the future c error from the first step ahead prediction could be accumulated at the beginning and propagates to the future which could lead to poor prediction it is observed from the single and multi step ahead prediction results in table 6 that the ability to achieve high correlation by almost all models decreases with further step ahead which could be obvious owing to decrease in generalization capabilities and error propagation of the models but certain models for certain stations achieved higher predictions with further step ahead for instance anfis model in the validation phase of kyrenia station which has nses 0 7584 0 7643 0 7774 and rmses 0 1283 0 1273 0 1261 for one step two step and three step ahead predictions respectively this could be because the models were developed with increasing time lags for further steps ahead thus by the first few lags perhaps an important period value that has great influence on the et0 is removed which may distort the entire data and subsequently affects the performance of the data driven models on the other hand as the lagging continuous a point would be reached where the time lags covered the entire season which balanced the missing values and hence results in better performance of the model moreover as trial and error methods were used to determine the best structure of the models perhaps better structure adjustments were achieved in the subsequent steps after the single step ahead modeling fig 7 shows observed vs predicted scatter plots in the validation phase for the best performing anfis model for north cyprus stations as example 3 1 3 results for iraq stations the single and multi step ahead results for erbil and salahaddin stations are presented in table 7 based on the results given in table 7 it can be seen that the performances of the models for single and multi step ahead et0 predictions are higher for erbil station than salahaddin station this revealed that climate of the region not only affects the et0 prediction for current time but also affects et0 predictions for further time ahead although the climate of salahaddin station has been categorized as semi arid sarlak and agha 2018 study reveals that the station s aridity changes depending on the applied aridity index and the time of investigation for instance between 1980 and 2011 the station was identified as sub humid using the united nations environment programme unep 1992 aridity index semi arid between 1998 and 2011 and sub humid between 1980 and 1997 the fluctuating nature of the climate makes et0 estimation difficult in the salahaddin station as elements of different climatic regions are contained in the long time data record the ai and mlr models fail to provide much reliable estimations in comparison to erbil station this results in least performance of the applied models in salahaddin compared to erbil stations the models applied for single and multi step ahead et0 predictions in erbil station led to higher values of et0 estimates but ai models provided superior performance than mlr model fig 8 shows observed vs predicted scatter plots in the verification phase for the best performing anfis model for iraq stations comparing the results in tables 5 7 it could be seen that for turkey cyprus and iraq stations the black box models performances are inferior to that of nourni et al 2019a study across all the 3 steps of the modeling this is because current data have a strong bond with the correlation of inputs and output which in turns bonded to markov chain of et0 process as data lag occurs the correlation bond between inputs and output weakens thereby resulting in weak markov chain and thus reduces the performance of the black box models whereas in the case of nourani et al 2019a study with no data lag correlation between inputs and output and the markovian process are of strong agreement and consequently resulting in higher performance of the black box models for instance fig 9 shows a section of three step ahead time series modeling of kyrenia station by ffnn anfis svr and mlr for better visibility of each model estimated values of et0 only 12 months period of the time series is shown january 2011 december 2011 as revealed in fig 9 the months of february april and september are selected randomly as points 1 2 and 3 respectively with regards to the first point point 1 mlr 1 7 mm day svr 1 2 mm day anfis 2 2 mm day ffnn 2 2 mm day and observed 1 6 mm day this implies that mlr value is more fitted to the observed than the other models which in turn revealed that even the poorest performing model at certain point of the time series could be the best at point 2 mlr 4 9 mm day svr 3 4 mm day anfis 2 9 mm day ffnn 3 1 mm day and observed 3 4 mm day this shows that the svr model performed better in terms of predicted vs observed agreement mlr model has the least accuracy at 4th rank in april compared to being the best in the month of february at the final point point 3 mlr 2 5 mm day svr 4 0 mm day anfis 4 7 mm day ffnn 4 3 mm day and observed 5 0 mm day this shows less deviation of the anfis model from the observed value in contrast to the others and svr model performed better at point 2 and 3rd at point 3 from the results of these three selected points it is apparent that at different time points different models could exhibit varied performance from different data aspects therefore the precise target can be captured better via ensemble approaches which amalgamate the outputs of the single models in this respect sa wa and ne ensemble models were developed for single and multi step ahead modeling 3 2 results of the ensemble techniques the individual models outputs were used as the ensemble models inputs for higher achievement of performance the weights for wa ensembles were generated via three methods i using only training data set ii using only validation data set iii using both data sets of validation and training although any of the three mentioned methods can be applied for the weights generation but different method may be more appropriate for different process thus for better performance all the three methods were assessed the third weights generation method led to superior result and hence applied for the weight generation in all turkey north cyprus and iraq stations similar to ffnn single models the lm algorithm was used to train the ne models and for both hidden and output layers tangent sigmoid was utilized as the activation function fig 10 presents the developed ffnn schematic diagram for ne modeling to determine the number of hidden neurons and best epoch number trial and error approach was employed ann was chosen for the ne modeling in this study over anfis and svr models due to its compatibility popularity as well as its accuracy in ensemble modeling as demonstrated in many studies such as kiran and ravi 2008 sharghi et al 2018 nourani et al 2019a b nevertheless other ai models anfis and svr could also be used as the kernel tables 8 10 depict the obtained ensemble models results for all modeling steps across all stations the sa structure a b serve as number of inputs and et0 as output w x y z for wa express the weights generated by the applied models and lastly the ensemble structure of ffnn is as previously explained for single ffnn model table 8 gives the single and multi step ahead results of the ensemble predictions for samsun izmir ankara and adana stations of turkey the results in table 8 show the ability of ensemble models for improving the prediction accuracy of single and multi step ahead models the results indicate that sa wa and ne models could be employed successfully for performance improvement of single and multi step ahead models nevertheless ne model performed better than the other methods due to nonlinear kernel applied for its development ne improved accuracy of the highest performing model anfis for single and multi step ahead predicts for turkey stations in the validation phase by 16 8 2 and 4 for one step ahead modeling 7 26 8 and 5 for two step ahead modeling and 12 30 14 and 8 for three step ahead modeling for adana ankara izmir and samsun respectively the ne approach improved the efficiency of the lowest performing model mlr for single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 for turkey stations in the validation phase by 25 26 4 and 35 for one step ahead modeling 15 19 15 and 26 for two step ahead modeling and 19 60 32 and 32 for three step ahead modeling for adana ankara izmir and samsun respectively comparing the results from tables 5 and 8 it can be deduced that unlike in the case of single models where the modeling accuracy decreases with further time step ahead the capability of ensemble approaches to improve prediction accuracy increases with further step ahead for instance for performance improvement over anfis the models for ankara izmir and samsun stations were improved by 8 2 and 4 for one step ahead but improved by 30 14 and 8 for three step ahead modeling similarly for ankara and izmir the mlr models were initially improved by 26 and 4 for one step ahead modeling but improved to 60 and 32 for three step ahead the ensemble results for single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 for nicosia morphou kyrenia and famagusta north cyprus stations are presented in table 9 the results in table 9 affirm the ability of ensemble modeling in improving the performance of the single and multi step ahead models for instance ne models improved performance of anfis model in the validation phase up to 2 16 1 and 16 for one step ahead modeling 15 17 13 and 19 for two step ahead modeling and 12 9 33 and 16 for three step ahead modeling for famagusta kyrenia morphou and nicosia respectively it is discovered that not significant improvement in nses and rmses were attained by sa and wa ensembles over single and multi step ahead ai models in both phases of training and validation but remarkably higher performance was achieved by ne models as earlier clarified different data behavior at different points in time could be grabbed with overestimation and underestimation of et0 by distinct models yet with each model particular capability in comparison to the case of single models better simulation of the underlying process could be achieved in this study the referred ensemble results table 9 show that the difference in performance between sa and wa ensemble models are not wide in most cases but wa models are superior in performance this is due to linear or direct relationship that sa and wa ensemble models shared with the single and multi step ahead models however wa model produced better prediction performance due to weights applied for its development which were generated according to the relative importance of the models moreover due to the direct impact the single and multi step ahead models have on sa and wa ensembles less performance single and multi step ahead models led to less performance sa and wa ensemble models the performances of sa and wa ensemble models are by far inferior to ne models owing to the following reasons i nonlinear kernel was used in ffnn to simulate the system behavior thus simulation by ffnn led to higher accuracy than the linear system of sa and wa methods ii the sa and wa models overall results may be influenced by the performances of single models signifying that lesser ensemble performances may be achieved from poor performing single models due to the linear correlation that exists between the single models and sa and wa ensemble methods iii the parameters as well as the implementation procedure for sa and wa ensemble models are fixed and constant unlike in the case of ne model where the hidden layer neurons and epoch number are altered through trial and error to provide the best structure that could lead to best results it is worth mentioning in view of the results that the performance of ensemble models is not based on one two or three step ahead predictions rather based on the ability of the single models to produce desired output for instance considering table 9 kyrenia has the highest performance among all stations which is derived from the single and multi step ahead models performance in table 6 this shows that ensemble modeling follows the trend of models development signifying that input combination influences the performances of single and multi step ahead models and improvement in prediction by ensemble models increases with increased performances of the single and multi step ahead models and vice versa finally the obtained results for single and multi step ensemble models across two iraq stations are presented in table 10 the results in table 10 indicate that sa wa and ne models could be employed successfully for performance improvement of the single and multi step ahead models however ne model performed better than the other methods it improved the accuracy of svr model for iraq stations in the validation phase by 21 and 24 for one step ahead modeling 14 and 11 for two step ahead modeling and 16 and 18 for three step ahead modeling for erbil and salahaddin respectively for example fig 11 shows observed vs predicted time series for the best ensemble models for one station from each country from the given fig 11 it is apparent that sa and wa models are less accurate than ne models the observed data are more fitted with values of the ne models whereas fluctuations between observed and predicted values are wider in the case of sa and wa ensembles to ascertain the performance of all models across the study stations for single and ensemble modeling nses and rmses average values of the models mlr svr anfis ffnn and sa wa ne were taken and presented in table 11 as seen in table 11 in single modeling for one time step ahead predictions in the validation phase the models show identical performances with a narrow difference for erbil morphou kyrenia famagusta izmir ankara and adana stations which were because all the climates of the stations are semiarid this shows that despite the distance and locations of the stations from different countries similarity of the climates led to similarity in models performances although nicosia station is a mediterranean semiarid climate as famagusta kyrenia and morphou being an inland city reduces the mediterranean sea effect of the station thereby resulting in inferior modeling performance compared to the other stations the average performance of the models in samsun station is lower than other turkey stations which was because samsun station is bls climate the bls climate has a uniform rainfall through the year but selection of dominant input parameters showed that pr is weak in markovian process which made it to be poor input for single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 this could be why the models performed better in other stations than samsun station for two step ahead predictions shown in table 11 the average of models performances are superior in erbil station than all other stations in the verification phase this could be because apart from being semiarid climate the station is characterized by sahara desert which could lead to increases in u2 which in turn increases the rate of evapotranspiration according to nourani et al 2019b u2 could produce poor performance for single input single output prediction but inclusion of u2 in combination with other parameters could increase the prediction efficiency for three step ahead predictions the results in table 11 for validation phase show that kyrenia station has the highest models performances this is because rs was found to have stronger bond with et0 among the input parameters and due to the presence of higher mountains surrounding kyrenia station the radiant energy could reach the earth surface faster and with more effects than for flat surrounding stations as ensemble modeling improved performance of the single models the average models results in table 11 show that higher ensemble results were achieved by higher single models but with the ability of nonlinear ensemble to deal with complex and uncertain problems lower performance average models could produce highest performance ensemble models it can be seen that contrary to single modeling where less accurate results were obtained by this study compared to nourani et al 2019a study more improvements were achieved by multi step ahead ensemble modeling of et0 than nourani et al 2019a study for instance in the validation phase of this study the prediction improvements over svr models were achieved up to 17 18 and 15 for adana station 10 13 and 11 for nicosia station and 25 11 and 19 for salahaddin station for one two and three step ahead et0 modeling against 4 2 and 6 improvements for adana nicosia and salahaddin stations by nourani et al 2019a study the results of this study affirmed the earlier assertion that lower performance models could lead to higher performance ensemble results due to wider space for improvement but more accurate and most efficient et0 modeling would be achieved from single models with higher performance for examples nourani et al 2019a ensemble study because of the effect of more efficient single modeling produced higher nses 0 9331 0 8993 0 8340 and rmses 0 0687 0 0805 0 0971 for adana nicosia and salahaddin stations respectively in comparison in this study lower nses were obtained 0 8775 0 7842 0 8118 for one step ahead modeling 0 7648 0 8063 0 6720 for two step ahead modeling 0 7379 0 7849 0 4625 for three step ahead modeling and higher rmses 0 0824 0 1305 0 1305 for one step ahead modeling 0 1141 0 1227 0 1367 for two step ahead modeling and 0 1205 0 1224 0 1750 for three step ahead modeling et process just like any other natural process may show both linear and nonlinear behaviors at different time spans for example in frozen days of winter the et time series gets small values having less complexity without significant fluctuations in this case a linear model may sufficiently lead to reliable results when time series of the process includes both linear and nonlinear patterns it is expected that the combination of linear and nonlinear models could lead to better final outcome such superior efficiency is reached via training of a black box ensemble method which learns using historical observations to apply appropriate weight to the components of the model at different patterns 4 conclusions in this study several artificial intelligences based models including ann anfis svr and conventional black box linear model mlr were applied for single and multi step ahead predictions of reference evapotranspiration in 10 stations including salahaddin erbil nicosia morphou kyrenia famagusta samsun izmir ankara and adana from iraq north cyprus and turkey regions respectively to increase the performances of the models which could be reduced by increasing the prediction horizon the ensemble methods which merge the outputs of the individual models including sa wa and ne were developed and applied the results of the single and multi step ahead modeling showed that ai models could lead to successful simulation of et0 in the study stations up to three steps ahead and mostly the performance decreases with further step ahead which reasonably could be due to continuous dependence on previous events for future step ahead mlr mostly underperformed for prediction of et0 beyond one step ahead the results showed that with the application of ensemble models better approximations could be achieved in modeling et0 the ensemble modeling averagely improved the performance of mlr model in the validation phase for turkey stations up to 23 for one step ahead modeling 19 for two step ahead modeling and 35 for three step ahead modeling the improvement achieved by ensemble modeling over anfis model for north cyprus stations was averagely 9 for one step ahead modeling 16 for two step ahead modeling and 18 for three step ahead modeling however the performance was averagely improved over svr model for iraq stations by 23 for one step ahead modeling 13 for two step ahead modeling and 17 for three step ahead modeling sa and wa ensembles did not show much performance improvement due to their linear behavior whereby a poor performing model may influence its outcome but wa is superior to sa because of the weights generated according to performance of the single models ne has the highest performance in all stations and modeling steps because of the ability of ffnn to deal with nonlinear phenomena this study results generally revealed the promising impact of models combination for the estimation of et0 the obtained ensemble results more specifically the ne method revealed that by combining outputs of individual models better accuracy could be achieved in et0 simulation than the application of single models for both single and multi step modeling this study is limited to the application of three ensemble methods for modeling et0 up to three step ahead hence the proposed ensemble method is suggested to be applied for further steps ahead modeling of et0 to ascertain the accuracy and effectiveness of the method beyond three step ahead modeling moreover the method could also be employed for other hydro climatic parameters modeling as well as inclusion of other black box based methods that were not used in this study in the ensembling unit additionally the use of other models such as anfis svr etc as kernels for ensemble modeling should be tested in future studies credit authorship contribution

5902,efficient estimation of reference evapotranspiration et0 becomes necessary for water resources management and irrigation practices despite research advancement in the recent decades results inconsistencies have been reported related to chaotic stochastic and black box approaches for multi step ahead prediction of et0 this study aimed at applying ensemble approaches to improve single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 to do so several artificial intelligence ai based techniques including support vector regression svr adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis artificial neural network ann and multiple linear regression mlr models were employed for one two and three steps ahead predictions of et0 for numerous climatic stations in iraq north cyprus and turkey monthly meteorological parameters were used as inputs for the models development finally two linear ensemble methods simple averaging and weighted averaging and a nonlinear ensemble method neural ensemble were applied for the single models performance and reliability improvements the results showed superior performance of ai based models with regard to the mlr model in addition promising improvements were achieved in single and multi step ahead et0 modeling by the application of the ensemble models the overall results revealed that the ensemble models proposed in this study could lead to increase in single models performance in the validation phase up to 60 33 and 24 for turkey north cyprus and iraq stations respectively keywords reference evapotranspiration ensemble models artificial intelligence artificial neural network pan evaporation 1 introduction water deficiency especially in arid and semi arid environments is becoming a problem that needs considerable attention for crop productions soil water balance and effective water resources management in such water scarce regions reference evapotranspiration et0 estimation with reliable accuracy is significant in hydro climatic studies the history that relates meteorological variables to evapotranspiration et can be traced back to early 19th century henceforth according to chen et al 2005 six categories of methods have been developed including 1 mass transfer methods for example shiri 2018 improved mass transfer based et0 estimation approaches through wavelet random forest methodology 2 pan evaporation methods 3 combination methods 4 temperature based methods 5 water budget methods and 6 radiation based methods for example shiri 2019a used mass transfer temperature radiation based et0 equations and a heuristic model to access the practical implications of et0 modeling in island environments the method of pan evaporation ep has been proven to be of practical value and consequently its application relating et0 to ep with empirical coefficients has been widely adopted for longer or 10 days period allen et al 1998 the aggregate effects of temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed on the et0 are provided by measurements from ep ep measurements of reasonable accuracy could successfully be used to achieve estimation of et0 as demonstrated by several studies efficient correlation between et0 and ep is expected to be seen when ep is properly adjusted khoob 2008 despite the reliability of conceptual and physical based models in examining the precise physics of a phenomenon they exhibit practical constraints and when physical understanding is of less significance than accurate predictions application of black box models can be helpful nourani et al 2019a multiple linear regression mlr is a linear conventional technique that measures the degree of relationship between dependent and one or multiple independent variables tabari et al 2012 toward modeling processes such kinds of linear basic models lose perfection in several areas subjected to nonlinearity dynamism and high complexity in temporal as well as in spatial scales recently methods of artificial intelligence ai have shown high performance accuracy for estimating et0 shiri et al 2019a for instance support vector regression svr adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and artificial neural network ann are of wider adaptation which yielded the publication of several articles in hydro climatic processes shiri 2019b applied neural networks and neuro fuzzy techniques for pan evaporation modeling in low altitude locations for et0 process kumar et al 2002 developed ann model for the estimation of et0 sudheer et al 2003 applied ann model using climate data of restricted limited amount to model et0 kisi 2006 employed generalized regression and feed forward neural networks grnn and ffnn for daily et0 estimation kisi and kilic 2016 evaluated ann and m5 model tree generalization capability for et0 modeling ann and empirical equations were applied by antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 using limited climate variables for daily et0 estimation anfis model has also been applied in many studies related to et0 modeling including kisi and oztürk 2007 study karimaldini et al 2011 investigated the potential of anfis in daily et0 modeling under arid climate using limited amount of climate variables mohammadrezapour et al 2019 applied anfis and other two ai models for potential evapotranspiration modeling in arid climate amiri et al 2019 applied fuzzy regression method under controlled environment to estimate et0 based on support vector machine svm concept the svr model as more recent emerging ai algorithm has fewer studies in technical literature for instance the application of svm to estimate daily et0 was evaluated by wen et al 2015 using combination of several meteorological inputs including wind speed solar radiation minimum and maximum temperature in the arid region of ejina basin china the reliability of svm and other ai models were investigated by fan et al 2018 to estimate daily et0 ferreira et al 2019 employed svm and ann models in a new approach to predict et0 using limited climate data shiri et al 2019b applied svm and 11 other soft computing approaches for et0 modeling in humid locations even though a quite reliable and accurate results might be achieved by the application of the ai based and mlr models for examples et0 studies by kisi and oztürk 2007 tabari et al 2012 wen et al 2015 amiri et al 2019 shiri et al 2019a it is apparent that different outcomes may be accomplished by different models for a particular problem therefore bates and granger 1969 study revealed that an amalgamation of several techniques would lead to results with minimal error variance whereas individual techniques would lead to larger error results combining several single models has become a general practice for accuracy improvement makridakis et al 1982 the idea behind model ensemble is to harness the exclusive characteristics of the single models in a unique framework which would lead to improvement of the modeling accuracy kiran and ravi 2008 in the hydro climatic processes in general and et0 modeling context in particular an up to date review of the literature shows that so far no study was done with the application of several ai based techniques for multi step ahead ensemble modeling therefore the main targets of this study are to perform multi step ahead modeling study of et0 in ten meteorological stations including samsun izmir adana ankara stations from turkey nicosia morphou kyrenia famagusta stations from north cyprus and erbil salahaddin stations from iraq and finally to employ the learning concept of ensemble techniques to improve predictions of the single models two steps were involved in the et0 modeling i ffnn commonly used ai model anfis which utilizes fuzzy concept to handle uncertainty of process svr most recent ai model and mlr a classical linear approach models were applied for multi step ahead et0 predictions ii thereafter the outputs of the individual models were used as inputs to weighted average simple average and neural ensemble wa sa ne approaches for accuracy enhancement other methods of ensemble modeling can also be applied as demonstrated by kiran and ravi 2008 however the advantages of adopting these particular approaches over others in this study are sa is simple to use and does not require complex procedure in its application wa uses weights which are not generated randomly rather based on relative significance of single models thereby improving performance and ne uses nonlinear kernel to simulate the system s behavior hence using the 3 ensemble approaches the linear and nonlinear aspects of et0 could be appropriately monitored it should be noted that this study is a follow up to nourani et al 2019a study whereby for the first time ensemble approaches were applied to model et0 in several climatic regions due to complexity involved whereby the forecasting accuracy decreases with increase in prediction horizon such as in karbasi 2018 study and owing to lagging and weak markovian process of the input data multi step ahead prediction of et0 is difficult to achieve nevertheless the results of nourani et al 2019a study show a tremendous contribution of ensemble learning towards et0 modeling by increasing prediction up to 22 for strategy 1 which are black box models over single modeling this necessitates the application of ensemble techniques in this study to verify whether the techniques can also be employed successfully to improve multi step ahead prediction of et0 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and data in this study ten stations from turkey nc and iraq representing different climatic regions were used for single and multi step ahead et0 modeling thus the study locations are described in accordance to the regions or countries of the study 2 1 1 turkey stations turkey is a transcontinental country located predominantly in asia see fig 1 certain area of its land enters portion on the balkan peninsula which is located in the southeast europe sea of marmara separated anatolia with europe s east thrace turkey is bordered by georgia to its northeast bulgaria and greece to its northwest iran azerbaijan exclave of nakhchivan and armenia to the east syria and iraq to the south turkish geographical area is covered between latitudes 360 and 420n and longitudes 260 and 450 e due to large inland plateau surrounded by rough topographical terrain of anatolia peninsula variation of temperature in the region is high the maximum temperature recorded at sanliurfa station is 46 8 c in the southeast while minimum temperature at agri station recorded as 42 8 c in the northeast pan evaporation varies annually between 435 and 2 800 mm year turkish annual average precipitation is 643 mm year citakoglu et al 2014 using seasonality index and total seasonal rainfall percentage ratio to the annual amount seven climatic regions in turkey were formed including continental eastern anatolia cean continental central anatolia ccan mediterranean to central anatolia transition medt continental mediterranean cmed mediterranean med marmara mediterranean to black sea transition mrt and black sea bls turkes 1996 adana station constitutes subtropical semi humid and humid climates in the med region characterized by heavy rainy and cool winter with a hot dry summer ankara station is situated in a semi arid steppe of continental central anatolia ccan region the climate of the station is comprised of cool rainy spring warm and light rainy summer and cold rainy winter izmir station is in med region and thereby shares same climate characteristics as adana station samsun station is a temperate climate located in the black sea bls region it is a consistently rainy climate with its peak in autumn table 1 gives data statistics coordinates and locations of turkey stations as demonstrated in table 1 ankara and samsun stations have fewer pr values compared to adana and izmir stations this could be due to partly semi humid and humid nature of the climate of the med region where adana and izmir stations are located ankara is a semi arid climate in the ccan region which has fewer rainfall in comparison to semi humid or humid climate while samsun is bls temperate climate moreover increase in aridity leads to decrease in precipitation which could be why ankara has a bit less precipitation than samsun nonetheless table 1 also revealed that the moderate nature of bls climate ensures the fall of tmin and tmax values within the range of other stations under study for data statistics of the samsun station 2 1 2 north cyprus stations north cyprus nc is the eastern mediterranean s third largest island and its climate is typically mediterranean with mild wet winters and hot dry summers rainfall occurrence mostly is between november to march as a whole the island annual average precipitation is 500 mm the highest point of the trodos mountain has an average of 1200 mm rainfall while at the central plain it is around 300 400 mm elkiran and ergil 2006 average temperature in nc falls between 5 and 15 0c in the first month of the year january and rises higher in july however according to class a pan reading annual evaporation reaches up to 2200 mm year recent research showed that through evapotranspiration about 80 of rainfall water returns to the atmosphere elkiran and ongul 2009 this study involves the use of data from four meteorological stations in north cyprus famagusta has a temperate and warm climate it has annual average rainfall of about 407 mm and 19 3 c average temperature kyrenia has hilly areas with about 500 mm 750 mm average rainfall falling particularly in winter and rarely in summer the coldest month in kyrenia station is january with an average temperature of about 10 c while july is the hottest month with an average temperature of about 29 c the highest rainfall range owing to altitude falls within 750 mm to 1110 mm in the kyrenia mountains morphou has a local steppe climate little rainfall is experienced in morphou in the whole year with about 363 mm annual precipitation fall and 18 5 c annual average temperature being an inland city located at the center of north cyprus the mediterranean sea effect is less in nicosia compared to the other cities located in the seacoast hence nicosia experience colder winters and hotter summers than the other coastal areas also day maximum and night minimum temperatures difference is large for july and august the hottest months the daytime temperatures difference between other cities and nicosia is about 4 c to 7 c in january and february the coldest months nicosia has about 2 c to 3 c daytime temperature difference less than on the coast table 2 gives data statistics coordinates and locations of north cyprus stations with dry hot summer and relatively mild or cool winter mediterranean climate high medium and low temperatures were observed as seen in table 2 nicosia has maximum pan evaporation value of 12 6 mm day whereas its minimum values for all the stations in north cyprus are 1 1 mm day 1 11 mm day 0 9 mm day and 1 1 mm day for nicosia morphou kyrenia and famagusta stations respectively relative humidity values are close due to the vicinity of the stations with maximum difference of 4 75 between morphou and famagusta stations and minimum difference of 1 99 between morphou and nicosia stations the lowest and the highest range of dew point temperatures are between 4 65 c 22 24 c 2 1 3 iraq stations iraq is historically called mesopotamia located in western asia fig 1 iraq population is about 37 2 million in 2016 and it has an area of land that covers 437 072 km2 iraq is bordered by 6 countries including jordan saudi arabia turkey kuwait syria and iran the longitudes and latitudes of iraq are between 38 45 and 48 45 e and 29 5 and 37 22 n nourani et al 2019a b with respect to rasul et al 2015 erbil is a city situated in northern iraq and is the capital of kurdistan erbil is situated within continental and semi arid climate it winter seasons are cool and rainy while summer seasons are warm and dry salahaddin is also a city located in kurdistan region of iraq the station is characterized by semi arid climate as reported by sarlak and agha 2018 study table 3 gives data statistics coordinates and locations of iraq stations erbil and salahaddin stations exhibit similar statistics due to their semi arid climate proximity as shown in table 3 erbil is less humid which results in lower relative humidity than salahaddin salahaddin station has tmax as high as 39 9 0c and as low as 0 0c while erbil station with the existence of hot semi arid climate has the highest tmax of 6 19 0c and 44 03 0c for the minimum and maximum values respectively the stations and regions of the study are shown in fig 1 the study data were obtained from the respective meteorological organizations of turkey north cyprus and iraq the data were divided into two sets 75 for training and 25 for validation table 4 illustrates information regarding the used datasets to ensure all variables received equal attention and to have dimensionless peculiarity during model training ai based modeling usually involves data normalization nourani et al 2012 two main benefits can be attributed to data normalization before exploiting ai based approaches for predictions the first is given smaller numeric ranges the ability to compete so as not to be overshadowed by bigger numeric ranges secondly numerical difficulties while calculation are also avoided with data normalization data normalization in this study was performed so as the values fall between 0 and 1 scale for efficiency and performance analysis of the models several globally accepted statistical indicators can be used including mean absolute error mae yaseen et al 2018 correlation coefficient r fotovatikhah et al 2018 root mean square error rmse moazenzadeh et al 2018 determination coefficient or nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nse ghorbani et al 2018 nevertheless according to legates and mccabe 1999 rmse and nse are sufficient for any hydro climatic modeling and are therefore employed in this study as the models performance evaluation criteria 1 nse 1 i 1 n e t 0 i et 0 i 2 i 1 n e t 0 i et 0 2 2 rmse i 1 n e t 0 i et 0 i 2 n where et 0 i et 0 e t 0 i and n are respectively the predicted values average of the observed values observed data and number of observations rmse is the measure of the forecasted values accuracy which by squaring the error gives positive value as the margins between forecasts and observations becomes large the rmse increases through large positive values for perfect forecasts from zero understandably rmse value towards 0 and high nse value towards 1 nse 1 signify model with high reliability 2 2 proposed methodology this study assessed the feasibility of applying the concept of ensemble learning for ai based and mlr models performance improvement for single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 initially one two and three step ahead models were developed by three ai based and mlr techniques finally the proposed ensemble modeling was carried out using the outputs produced by the single models the fundamental notion behind model ensemble is owing to the following i most of the times in practice it is difficult to determine for a time series under study if the underlying process is induced by a nonlinear or linear circumstance or whether the application of one model or a particular method yields better results than others consequently selection of the best technique or choosing the best befitting method is a difficult task before the predictors for a unique issue therefore the problem arises while selecting the appropriate model could be handled by the application of ensemble learning sharghi et al 2018 ii both linear and non linear characteristics may be involved in time series predictions for a real world process neither mlr nor ai could be satisfactory in such situation for the time series prediction as non linear relationship cannot be handled by mlr model whereas ai models could magnify errors of a linear pattern thus the data complex stochastic nature could be grabbed more appropriately by combination of mlr and ai models iii as revealed by previous studies such as sharghi et al 2018 nourani et al 2019a there is no specific method or a unique model that can completely examine a process the complex and uncertain nature of real world problem could be largely the cause whereby distinct patterns of the process might not be detected accurately by a unique model the proposed study methodology is shown in fig 2 to have a proper comparison of the computed et0 over the study regions same methodology given in fig 2 was used for all stations 10 stations from turkey north cyprus and iraq the next sub sections present details of the used tools and components of the models 2 3 artificial neural network ann ann is a convincing ai technique that is capable of handling enormous amount of dynamism nonlinear and noisy data especially when the physical underlying relationships are not completely understood this confirms ann as an appropriate time series modeling data driven tool nourani et al 2015 ann constitutes a number of simple interconnected processing elements known as nodes or neurons with fascinating peculiarity of information processing characteristics such as noise tolerance nonlinearity generalization capability parallelism and learning for providing solutions to many engineering problems among the methods of neural networks ffnn with back propagation bp algorithm are the most common applied methods hornik et al 1989 the ffnn technique is composed of parallel processing element layers known as neuron and every layer is being connected fully by weights to the proceeding layer generally those anns learning are accomplished by bp algorithm hornik et al 1989 among many training algorithms of ann in this study levenberg marquardt lm was preferred selection due to its fast convergence ability as affirmed by sahoo et al 2005 lm algorithm is a hybrid technique which utilizes both steepest descent and gauss newton to converge to an optimal solution to solve a wider range problems the hybrid approach usually used to trade off the best characteristics of different algorithms for instance if the initial guess is relatively close to the optimal solution gauss newton approach is faster as such utilized by lm algorithm in a contrary situation the lm algorithm uses the aspect of steepest descent approach to traverse the design space and find a potential solution area and then find the optimum for solving systems of nonlinear equations this technique is particularly effective wilson and mantooth 2013 meanwhile for both output and hidden layers the transfer function applied was tangent sigmoid tansig besides trial and error process was employed to ensure optimum number of hidden layer neurons and to determine the calibration epochs fig 3 shows the three layered ffnn structure 2 4 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis in the literature of neural network nn neuro fuzzy modeling refers to fuzzy modeling approaches which involve the application of distinctive learning algorithm to fuzzy inference system fis a peculiar approach in the neuro fuzzy development is anfis which utilize nn learning algorithm and was first introduced by jang 1993 fuzzy database fuzzifier and defuzzifier are the three major parts that are constituted in every fuzzy system nourani and komasi 2013 nourani et al 2015 the two fundamental parts of fuzzy database are fuzzy rule base and inference engine fuzzy rule base comprises fuzzy propositions related rules that are revealed by jang et al 1997 hence operation analysis is applied in fuzzy inference the two most famous fuzzy inference engine are sugeno and mamdani which both could be employed to achieve a desired goal anfis as a universal approximator has the ability of impacting accuracy for all real continuous functions to a higher degree anfis is functionally equal to fis as stated by jang et al 1997 here anfis system is specifically equivalent to the first order sugeno fuzzy model jang et al 1997 fig 4 gives the general structure of anfis as displayed by fig 4 x and y are considered to be inputs of the anfis and ƒ is the output the first order sugeno fuzzy model constitutes two fuzzy if then sets of rules given by 3 rule 1 if μ x is a 1 and μ y is b 1 thef 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 4 rule 2 if μ x is a 2 and μ y is b 2 thef 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 in which a 1 and a 2 are x inputs mfs b 1 and b 2 are y inputs mfs respectively while the output function parameters are p 1 q 1 r 1 and p 2 q 2 r 2 the functions of each anfis layer are as follows layer 1 in this layer each node produced an input variable membership grades q i k donates k layer i th node output assuming as the membership function mf of a generalized bell function gbellmf the output q i 1 can be obtain from jang and sun 1995 as 5 q i 1 μ a i x 1 1 x c i a i 2 b i where a i b i c i represent adaptable variables which are called premise parameters layer 2 the incoming signals are multiplied by each node in this layer as 6 q i 2 w i μ a i x μ b i y i 1 2 layer 3 in this layer the i th node calculated the normalized firing strength 7 q i 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 layer 4 in this layer node i calculated the contribution given by the i th rule to the model output 8 q i 4 w i p i x p i y r i w i f i where p 1 q 1 r 1 is the perimeter set w i is the layer 3 output layer 5 in this layer single node is used to calculate the overall output of the anfis jang and sun 1995 9 q i 5 i w i f i i w i f i i w i combination of gradient descent and least squares methods formed a hybrid anfis learning algorithm the optimization parameters are a i b i c i which are the premise parameters while the consequent parameters are p i q i r i towards forward pass in the approach of the hybrid learning until layer 4 the consequent parameter is identified by the least square technique and the node output goes forward fig 4 in the backward pass the error signals propagate backward and the premise parameters are updated by the gradient descent nourani and komasi 2013 2 5 support vector regression svr based on svm concept the svr model was developed to be used for non linear regression issues contrary to several other black box forecasting methods svr as one of the svm based methods consider operational risk as the objective function to be minimized instead of minimizing the error between computed and observed values in svr at first a linear regression is fitted on the data and then the outputs go through a non linear kernel to catch the non linear pattern of the data given a set of training data x i d i i n di is the actual value xi represents the input vector and n is the data number the svr function is generally given as wang et al 2013 10 y f x w φ x i b where φ xi is mapped non linearly from input vector which indicates feature spaces by minimizing the objective function and assigning positive values for the slack parameters of ξ and ξ regression parameters b and w may be determined wang et al 2013 m i n i m i z e 1 2 w 2 c i n ξ i ξ i s u b j e c t t o w i φ x i b i d i ε ξ i d i w i φ x i b i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i i 1 2 n where 1 2 w 2 implies weights vector norm and c represents regularized constant which determine the arrangement between the regularized term and the empirical error ε is the tube size which is equivalent to accuracy approximation positioned within the training data points by defining lagrange multipliers αi and αi dual quadratic optimization problem could be resulted from the mentioned optimization problem after dealing with the quadratic optimization problem vector w can be determined as wang et al 2013 11 w i 1 n α i α i φ x i finally svr is given as wang et al 2013 12 f x α i α i i 1 n α i α i k x x i b k xi xj is the kernel function into feature space which performs the non linear mapping and b is bias term gaussian radial basis function rbf is the one commonly used kernel function given as 13 k x 1 x 2 e x p γ x 1 x 2 2 where γ is the kernel parameter 2 6 multiple linear regression multiple linear regression mlr is a classical technique that mathematically modeled the linear relationship that exists between dependent and predictor variables in general the n predictor variables and y dependent variable may have relation via nourani et al 2019a 14 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 3 x 3 b i x i ξ where x i represents the the i th predictor value b 0 is the constant of regression and b i is the the i th predictor coefficient and ξ represents the error term 2 7 multi step ahead predictions multi step ahead predictions are the predictions of parameters for some future time steps i e φ n h with h 1 2 3 h while h is the integer having value greater than one in view of the current and previous observations i e φ t t 1 2 3 n multi step ahead modeling is good for decision making and could be used to provide warning and counter measures for the persistent climate change impact on hydro climatic processes such as et0 iterated and direct algorithms are the two most commonly applied methods for the multi step ahead modeling bao et al 2014 for iterated algorithm a prediction model is constructed by minimizing the squares of one step ahead residual thereafter the predicted values are used as inputs to predict the next values in direct algorithm prediction models are constructed for each horizon by applying only its past observations bao et al 2014 in this study direct algorithm was employed since the next step is independent of the previous step and there is susceptibility of error accumulation problem for iterated algorithm as it uses past predicted values to generate next step ahead prediction 2 8 ensemble modeling it is an apparent issue that for a particular set of data one intelligent technique may provide superior performance than another similarly by applying same method to a different dataset the latter results may contradict the former in order not to lose generality and also to enjoy the mutual advantages of all the applied techniques an ensemble model is developed which provides the collective benefits by utilizing the outputs of all the single techniques with each technique being assigned certain degree of priority and then the output is provided by the help of an arbitrator kiran and ravi 2008 according to kiran and ravi 2008 the methods for ensemble learning are classified as i linear ensemble methods include weighted median simple averaging and weighted averaging ii nonlinear ensemble method using a nonlinear approach to perform ensemble modeling for example training ann with an ensemble approach linear and nonlinear ensemble modeling were applied in this study via simple averaging weighted averaging and ffnn ensemble methods simple averaging sa is conducted through the following expression 15 et 1 n i 1 n et i where et is the simple average ensemble output et i is the ith single model output and n is the total number of the single models used for this study n is equal to 4 the weighted averaging wa ensemble is done via 16 et i 1 n w i e t i where w i is the weight applied on the i th model output determined based on the model performance expressed as 17 w i nse i i 1 n nse i nsei is called the determination coefficient which determines performance efficiency of the ith single model ffnn anfis svr and mlr individual outputs in the nonlinear ensemble ne approach are combined together as new inputs to the nonlinear model ffnn is selected in this study as the nonlinear model to obtain the overall ensemble output fig 5 describes the general ensemble procedure 3 results and discussion this study was conducted in two steps the first step involves the application of ffnn anfis svr and mlr models for one three step ahead predictions of et0 in the second step linear and nonlinear ensemble modeling was carried out for the assessment of performance improvement of the single models hence the results obtained are presented accordingly 3 1 results of one and multi step ahead predictions via single models for single and multi step ahead predictions the three ai based and mlr approaches were applied for the et0 prediction for better forecasting precision the 12 input parameters were subjected to several time lags up to 12 months to check for markovian strength of the parameters and to ensure that the seasonality of the process is covered the results showed that ep and rs have strong markov chain while tmean tmin tmax td rh pr umin umax umean and sp are weak in markovian process implying that for ep and rs the next step ahead et0 values are dependent on sequence of previous events whereas for tmean tmin tmax td rh pr umin umax umean and sp et0 values for the next step are dependent only on its current values this could be because of the strong correlation that exists between ep and rs for determination of et0 which keeps their bonding together despite lagging in time owing to this development several input combinations were formed for the single and multi step ahead predictions containing only the time lags for ep and rs as 18 et 0 t h f r s e p e p t 1 e p t 12 r s t 1 r s t 12 where et 0 t h is the predicted values for single and multi step ahead et0 h 1 2 3 t 1 t 12 are monthly time lags r s e p have been previously defined the ffnn was trained using levenberg marquardt algorithm with sole hidden layer and varied hidden neurons number for the simulation of et0 to ascertain the suitable hidden layer nodes optimal number for each region trial and error approach was adopted for the anfis model in this study sugeno type fuzzy inference algorithm was used which via hybrid optimization algorithm a given input output dataset calibrated the membership function parameters for the development of anfis model structure and to determine the best anfis construction trial and error procedure was also applied gaussian shaped triangular and trapezoidal membership functions mfs were used across all stations due to their suitability in the simulation of et0 for most optimum performance the training epochs were modified rbf was used as the kernel for the creation of svr models for the entire study stations the two sigmoid and polynomial kernels tuning parameters are more than that of the rbf kernel the rbf kernel considering smoothness assumptions also shows better svr modeling performance sharghi et al 2018 for efficient reliable and best et0 modeling performance in the study stations the svr parameters were tuned using rbf kernel finally this study also employs the application of mlr model which linearly expresses the relationship between independent and dependent variables tables 5 7 present the obtained results for the best performing ffnn anfis

location and time step prediction table 5 shows the results of the single and multi step ahead modeling of et0 for turkey stations the results in table 5 show that the efficiency of the models to predict et0 decreases with increased step ahead implying that the correlation between the inputs and output decreases as precedence horizon goes on which weakens the markovian characteristic of the inputs on output thereby lessening the models performances the results also demonstrated the superiority in performance of ai models over mlr model whereby the ai models produced better performances across all of the modeling steps which could be due to the inability of mlr model to deal with nonlinear behavior of the system drastic reduction in the performance and increase in error of mlr model could also be noticed which make it difficult to cope with future forecast of et0 for example considering ankara station the nse and rmse in the validation phase for single step ahead are 0 5490 and 0 1696 while the nse and rmse in the validation phase for three step ahead are 0 1765 and 0 2291 the results in table 5 also show that the performances of the ai and mlr models in term of lower rmse and higher nse in adana station are better than in samsun station across all steps of the modeling this could be attributed to higher amount of precipitation received by the med climate and based on water cycle concept frequent evapotranspiration lead to condensation and eventual precipitation this demonstrates that ai models estimate evapotranspiration easier when there is higher frequency of precipitation however as a temperate bls climate station samsun may possess higher fluctuation of et0 which its complexity might lead to inefficiency and error accumulation that could reduce the accuracy of the ai models the obtained results also show superior performance of ankara station over samsun station for the applied models this is because ankara station has semi arid climate being located in ccan environment whereas samsun station constitutes temperate climate of bls region and ai models were developed to provide efficient predictions where empirical models fail to have accurate predictions due to severe climate condition more specifically arid and semi arid climates hence ai models may not produce peak performance in predicting et0 for stations with less extremity of climate in view of the results in table 5 it can be seen that both ai and mlr models provided lesser performances for samsun station in comparison to other stations in all three steps of et0 predictions the least performance among ai models is for svr model in samsun station for three step ahead et0 prediction which has nse 0 2932 and rmse 0 2243 this reveals that ai and mlr models performances are affected negatively by the bls temperate climate of samsun station but the threat caused by the region climate can be resisted by ai based models which across all modeling steps provided efficient performance owing to their nonlinear nature and capability to overcome the uncertainty of the climate behavior moreover despite the robustness of the ai based models and their ability to provide efficient and dependable results for bls climate region other stations have superior performances than samsun station this implies that even with the application of ai based models in such region reliable results could be produced but not at the peak the overall results of the stations located in turkey show that et0 modeling is affected by the climate of the regions with the least models performance from bls region followed by ccan region and best performance was achieved in med region fig 6 shows observed vs predicted scatter plots in the validation phase for the best performing anfis model for turkey stations 3 1 2 results for north cyprus stations table 6 shows the models performances for single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 for north cyprus stations more accurate and reliability estimates of et0 are provided by ai based models in comparison to linear models among the applied models for one step ahead modeling the mlr models yielded acceptable results based on the performance evaluation criteria applied for the et0 prediction in both training and validation phases nevertheless with further predictions ahead mlr models failed to give reliable performance especially in the validation phase this could be because mlr model generates more error with further predictions ahead due to the presence of nonlinear behavior of et0 in addition as mlr modeled the linear relationship between et0 and other input variables lag in time could seem like breaking the linear chain between the inputs and output which resulted in inaccurate results hence the higher the lags the wider the linear relation and thus the decrease in mlr performance it is apparent from the results shown in table 6 that both ai and mlr models produced better results for famagusta station for single step ahead prediction compared to their performances in other stations but provided better predictions for two and three step ahead predictions in kyrenia station the better performance of mlr model in famagusta station could be due to the effect of the input combination applied so that the data for the station behave more linear which led to less error and better efficiency than the other stations but magnified with further predictions ahead moreover the relationship between previous and current et0 might be stronger in kyrenia station in such a way that previous months lags might not result in significant difference to the current and future et0 kyrenia on the other hand has unique characteristics among the stations the hills and valley nature of its terrain the presence of rocks surrounding the region higher precipitation frequency etc these could strengthen the bond between previous and future et0 despite the reduction in performance due to increase in error and uncertainty for future et0 prediction the performances of all the ai based models are found to be promising across the study stations which could be attributed to their capability of containing the complex et0 process considering single step ahead predictions anfis achieved better predictions in both training and validation phases for famagusta and morphou stations with nse 0 7942 rmse 0 1225 and nse 0 7720 rmse 0 1249 for famagusta nse 0 7839 rmse 0 1404 and nse 0 7382 rmse 0 1442 for morphou in the training and validation phases respectively in the validation phase of kyrenia station svr was found to have inferior performance compared to anfis by 2 but produced better results in the training phase in nicosia station also higher prediction accuracy was demonstrated by svr model over anfis and ffnn models the efficient performance of the anfis in famagusta morphou and kyrenia in the validation phase despite ann s ability of handling various real world problems may likely be associated with the ann shortcomings in dealing with less accurate and uncertain data consequently with incorporation of fuzzy logic ability and neural network concept for handing uncertainty of a process the better option might be anfis moghaddamnia et al 2009 table 6 also shows the multi step ahead time series predictions for two and three step ahead with the implementation of machine learning models such as neural networks more robust and more reliable performances were achieved despite increase in time lags and 3 ai models ffnn anfis and svr were found to have promising performances by maintaining good generalization capability up to three step ahead in contrast mlr model performance was relatively poor for further time step ahead the underperformance of mlr could be because a most time series data contain nonlinear property and mlr being a linear model could not cope with a nonlinear process b it is difficult to achieve multi step ahead prediction successfully with a linear model due to lack of real data to adjust the performance of the model for the future c error from the first step ahead prediction could be accumulated at the beginning and propagates to the future which could lead to poor prediction it is observed from the single and multi step ahead prediction results in table 6 that the ability to achieve high correlation by almost all models decreases with further step ahead which could be obvious owing to decrease in generalization capabilities and error propagation of the models but certain models for certain stations achieved higher predictions with further step ahead for instance anfis model in the validation phase of kyrenia station which has nses 0 7584 0 7643 0 7774 and rmses 0 1283 0 1273 0 1261 for one step two step and three step ahead predictions respectively this could be because the models were developed with increasing time lags for further steps ahead thus by the first few lags perhaps an important period value that has great influence on the et0 is removed which may distort the entire data and subsequently affects the performance of the data driven models on the other hand as the lagging continuous a point would be reached where the time lags covered the entire season which balanced the missing values and hence results in better performance of the model moreover as trial and error methods were used to determine the best structure of the models perhaps better structure adjustments were achieved in the subsequent steps after the single step ahead modeling fig 7 shows observed vs predicted scatter plots in the validation phase for the best performing anfis model for north cyprus stations as example 3 1 3 results for iraq stations the single and multi step ahead results for erbil and salahaddin stations are presented in table 7 based on the results given in table 7 it can be seen that the performances of the models for single and multi step ahead et0 predictions are higher for erbil station than salahaddin station this revealed that climate of the region not only affects the et0 prediction for current time but also affects et0 predictions for further time ahead although the climate of salahaddin station has been categorized as semi arid sarlak and agha 2018 study reveals that the station s aridity changes depending on the applied aridity index and the time of investigation for instance between 1980 and 2011 the station was identified as sub humid using the united nations environment programme unep 1992 aridity index semi arid between 1998 and 2011 and sub humid between 1980 and 1997 the fluctuating nature of the climate makes et0 estimation difficult in the salahaddin station as elements of different climatic regions are contained in the long time data record the ai and mlr models fail to provide much reliable estimations in comparison to erbil station this results in least performance of the applied models in salahaddin compared to erbil stations the models applied for single and multi step ahead et0 predictions in erbil station led to higher values of et0 estimates but ai models provided superior performance than mlr model fig 8 shows observed vs predicted scatter plots in the verification phase for the best performing anfis model for iraq stations comparing the results in tables 5 7 it could be seen that for turkey cyprus and iraq stations the black box models performances are inferior to that of nourni et al 2019a study across all the 3 steps of the modeling this is because current data have a strong bond with the correlation of inputs and output which in turns bonded to markov chain of et0 process as data lag occurs the correlation bond between inputs and output weakens thereby resulting in weak markov chain and thus reduces the performance of the black box models whereas in the case of nourani et al 2019a study with no data lag correlation between inputs and output and the markovian process are of strong agreement and consequently resulting in higher performance of the black box models for instance fig 9 shows a section of three step ahead time series modeling of kyrenia station by ffnn anfis svr and mlr for better visibility of each model estimated values of et0 only 12 months period of the time series is shown january 2011 december 2011 as revealed in fig 9 the months of february april and september are selected randomly as points 1 2 and 3 respectively with regards to the first point point 1 mlr 1 7 mm day svr 1 2 mm day anfis 2 2 mm day ffnn 2 2 mm day and observed 1 6 mm day this implies that mlr value is more fitted to the observed than the other models which in turn revealed that even the poorest performing model at certain point of the time series could be the best at point 2 mlr 4 9 mm day svr 3 4 mm day anfis 2 9 mm day ffnn 3 1 mm day and observed 3 4 mm day this shows that the svr model performed better in terms of predicted vs observed agreement mlr model has the least accuracy at 4th rank in april compared to being the best in the month of february at the final point point 3 mlr 2 5 mm day svr 4 0 mm day anfis 4 7 mm day ffnn 4 3 mm day and observed 5 0 mm day this shows less deviation of the anfis model from the observed value in contrast to the others and svr model performed better at point 2 and 3rd at point 3 from the results of these three selected points it is apparent that at different time points different models could exhibit varied performance from different data aspects therefore the precise target can be captured better via ensemble approaches which amalgamate the outputs of the single models in this respect sa wa and ne ensemble models were developed for single and multi step ahead modeling 3 2 results of the ensemble techniques the individual models outputs were used as the ensemble models inputs for higher achievement of performance the weights for wa ensembles were generated via three methods i using only training data set ii using only validation data set iii using both data sets of validation and training although any of the three mentioned methods can be applied for the weights generation but different method may be more appropriate for different process thus for better performance all the three methods were assessed the third weights generation method led to superior result and hence applied for the weight generation in all turkey north cyprus and iraq stations similar to ffnn single models the lm algorithm was used to train the ne models and for both hidden and output layers tangent sigmoid was utilized as the activation function fig 10 presents the developed ffnn schematic diagram for ne modeling to determine the number of hidden neurons and best epoch number trial and error approach was employed ann was chosen for the ne modeling in this study over anfis and svr models due to its compatibility popularity as well as its accuracy in ensemble modeling as demonstrated in many studies such as kiran and ravi 2008 sharghi et al 2018 nourani et al 2019a b nevertheless other ai models anfis and svr could also be used as the kernel tables 8 10 depict the obtained ensemble models results for all modeling steps across all stations the sa structure a b serve as number of inputs and et0 as output w x y z for wa express the weights generated by the applied models and lastly the ensemble structure of ffnn is as previously explained for single ffnn model table 8 gives the single and multi step ahead results of the ensemble predictions for samsun izmir ankara and adana stations of turkey the results in table 8 show the ability of ensemble models for improving the prediction accuracy of single and multi step ahead models the results indicate that sa wa and ne models could be employed successfully for performance improvement of single and multi step ahead models nevertheless ne model performed better than the other methods due to nonlinear kernel applied for its development ne improved accuracy of the highest performing model anfis for single and multi step ahead predicts for turkey stations in the validation phase by 16 8 2 and 4 for one step ahead modeling 7 26 8 and 5 for two step ahead modeling and 12 30 14 and 8 for three step ahead modeling for adana ankara izmir and samsun respectively the ne approach improved the efficiency of the lowest performing model mlr for single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 for turkey stations in the validation phase by 25 26 4 and 35 for one step ahead modeling 15 19 15 and 26 for two step ahead modeling and 19 60 32 and 32 for three step ahead modeling for adana ankara izmir and samsun respectively comparing the results from tables 5 and 8 it can be deduced that unlike in the case of single models where the modeling accuracy decreases with further time step ahead the capability of ensemble approaches to improve prediction accuracy increases with further step ahead for instance for performance improvement over anfis the models for ankara izmir and samsun stations were improved by 8 2 and 4 for one step ahead but improved by 30 14 and 8 for three step ahead modeling similarly for ankara and izmir the mlr models were initially improved by 26 and 4 for one step ahead modeling but improved to 60 and 32 for three step ahead the ensemble results for single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 for nicosia morphou kyrenia and famagusta north cyprus stations are presented in table 9 the results in table 9 affirm the ability of ensemble modeling in improving the performance of the single and multi step ahead models for instance ne models improved performance of anfis model in the validation phase up to 2 16 1 and 16 for one step ahead modeling 15 17 13 and 19 for two step ahead modeling and 12 9 33 and 16 for three step ahead modeling for famagusta kyrenia morphou and nicosia respectively it is discovered that not significant improvement in nses and rmses were attained by sa and wa ensembles over single and multi step ahead ai models in both phases of training and validation but remarkably higher performance was achieved by ne models as earlier clarified different data behavior at different points in time could be grabbed with overestimation and underestimation of et0 by distinct models yet with each model particular capability in comparison to the case of single models better simulation of the underlying process could be achieved in this study the referred ensemble results table 9 show that the difference in performance between sa and wa ensemble models are not wide in most cases but wa models are superior in performance this is due to linear or direct relationship that sa and wa ensemble models shared with the single and multi step ahead models however wa model produced better prediction performance due to weights applied for its development which were generated according to the relative importance of the models moreover due to the direct impact the single and multi step ahead models have on sa and wa ensembles less performance single and multi step ahead models led to less performance sa and wa ensemble models the performances of sa and wa ensemble models are by far inferior to ne models owing to the following reasons i nonlinear kernel was used in ffnn to simulate the system behavior thus simulation by ffnn led to higher accuracy than the linear system of sa and wa methods ii the sa and wa models overall results may be influenced by the performances of single models signifying that lesser ensemble performances may be achieved from poor performing single models due to the linear correlation that exists between the single models and sa and wa ensemble methods iii the parameters as well as the implementation procedure for sa and wa ensemble models are fixed and constant unlike in the case of ne model where the hidden layer neurons and epoch number are altered through trial and error to provide the best structure that could lead to best results it is worth mentioning in view of the results that the performance of ensemble models is not based on one two or three step ahead predictions rather based on the ability of the single models to produce desired output for instance considering table 9 kyrenia has the highest performance among all stations which is derived from the single and multi step ahead models performance in table 6 this shows that ensemble modeling follows the trend of models development signifying that input combination influences the performances of single and multi step ahead models and improvement in prediction by ensemble models increases with increased performances of the single and multi step ahead models and vice versa finally the obtained results for single and multi step ensemble models across two iraq stations are presented in table 10 the results in table 10 indicate that sa wa and ne models could be employed successfully for performance improvement of the single and multi step ahead models however ne model performed better than the other methods it improved the accuracy of svr model for iraq stations in the validation phase by 21 and 24 for one step ahead modeling 14 and 11 for two step ahead modeling and 16 and 18 for three step ahead modeling for erbil and salahaddin respectively for example fig 11 shows observed vs predicted time series for the best ensemble models for one station from each country from the given fig 11 it is apparent that sa and wa models are less accurate than ne models the observed data are more fitted with values of the ne models whereas fluctuations between observed and predicted values are wider in the case of sa and wa ensembles to ascertain the performance of all models across the study stations for single and ensemble modeling nses and rmses average values of the models mlr svr anfis ffnn and sa wa ne were taken and presented in table 11 as seen in table 11 in single modeling for one time step ahead predictions in the validation phase the models show identical performances with a narrow difference for erbil morphou kyrenia famagusta izmir ankara and adana stations which were because all the climates of the stations are semiarid this shows that despite the distance and locations of the stations from different countries similarity of the climates led to similarity in models performances although nicosia station is a mediterranean semiarid climate as famagusta kyrenia and morphou being an inland city reduces the mediterranean sea effect of the station thereby resulting in inferior modeling performance compared to the other stations the average performance of the models in samsun station is lower than other turkey stations which was because samsun station is bls climate the bls climate has a uniform rainfall through the year but selection of dominant input parameters showed that pr is weak in markovian process which made it to be poor input for single and multi step ahead predictions of et0 this could be why the models performed better in other stations than samsun station for two step ahead predictions shown in table 11 the average of models performances are superior in erbil station than all other stations in the verification phase this could be because apart from being semiarid climate the station is characterized by sahara desert which could lead to increases in u2 which in turn increases the rate of evapotranspiration according to nourani et al 2019b u2 could produce poor performance for single input single output prediction but inclusion of u2 in combination with other parameters could increase the prediction efficiency for three step ahead predictions the results in table 11 for validation phase show that kyrenia station has the highest models performances this is because rs was found to have stronger bond with et0 among the input parameters and due to the presence of higher mountains surrounding kyrenia station the radiant energy could reach the earth surface faster and with more effects than for flat surrounding stations as ensemble modeling improved performance of the single models the average models results in table 11 show that higher ensemble results were achieved by higher single models but with the ability of nonlinear ensemble to deal with complex and uncertain problems lower performance average models could produce highest performance ensemble models it can be seen that contrary to single modeling where less accurate results were obtained by this study compared to nourani et al 2019a study more improvements were achieved by multi step ahead ensemble modeling of et0 than nourani et al 2019a study for instance in the validation phase of this study the prediction improvements over svr models were achieved up to 17 18 and 15 for adana station 10 13 and 11 for nicosia station and 25 11 and 19 for salahaddin station for one two and three step ahead et0 modeling against 4 2 and 6 improvements for adana nicosia and salahaddin stations by nourani et al 2019a study the results of this study affirmed the earlier assertion that lower performance models could lead to higher performance ensemble results due to wider space for improvement but more accurate and most efficient et0 modeling would be achieved from single models with higher performance for examples nourani et al 2019a ensemble study because of the effect of more efficient single modeling produced higher nses 0 9331 0 8993 0 8340 and rmses 0 0687 0 0805 0 0971 for adana nicosia and salahaddin stations respectively in comparison in this study lower nses were obtained 0 8775 0 7842 0 8118 for one step ahead modeling 0 7648 0 8063 0 6720 for two step ahead modeling 0 7379 0 7849 0 4625 for three step ahead modeling and higher rmses 0 0824 0 1305 0 1305 for one step ahead modeling 0 1141 0 1227 0 1367 for two step ahead modeling and 0 1205 0 1224 0 1750 for three step ahead modeling et process just like any other natural process may show both linear and nonlinear behaviors at different time spans for example in frozen days of winter the et time series gets small values having less complexity without significant fluctuations in this case a linear model may sufficiently lead to reliable results when time series of the process includes both linear and nonlinear patterns it is expected that the combination of linear and nonlinear models could lead to better final outcome such superior efficiency is reached via training of a black box ensemble method which learns using historical observations to apply appropriate weight to the components of the model at different patterns 4 conclusions in this study several artificial intelligences based models including ann anfis svr and conventional black box linear model mlr were applied for single and multi step ahead predictions of reference evapotranspiration in 10 stations including salahaddin erbil nicosia morphou kyrenia famagusta samsun izmir ankara and adana from iraq north cyprus and turkey regions respectively to increase the performances of the models which could be reduced by increasing the prediction horizon the ensemble methods which merge the outputs of the individual models including sa wa and ne were developed and applied the results of the single and multi step ahead modeling showed that ai models could lead to successful simulation of et0 in the study stations up to three steps ahead and mostly the performance decreases with further step ahead which reasonably could be due to continuous dependence on previous events for future step ahead mlr mostly underperformed for prediction of et0 beyond one step ahead the results showed that with the application of ensemble models better approximations could be achieved in modeling et0 the ensemble modeling averagely improved the performance of mlr model in the validation phase for turkey stations up to 23 for one step ahead modeling 19 for two step ahead modeling and 35 for three step ahead modeling the improvement achieved by ensemble modeling over anfis model for north cyprus stations was averagely 9 for one step ahead modeling 16 for two step ahead modeling and 18 for three step ahead modeling however the performance was averagely improved over svr model for iraq stations by 23 for one step ahead modeling 13 for two step ahead modeling and 17 for three step ahead modeling sa and wa ensembles did not show much performance improvement due to their linear behavior whereby a poor performing model may influence its outcome but wa is superior to sa because of the weights generated according to performance of the single models ne has the highest performance in all stations and modeling steps because of the ability of ffnn to deal with nonlinear phenomena this study results generally revealed the promising impact of models combination for the estimation of et0 the obtained ensemble results more specifically the ne method revealed that by combining outputs of individual models better accuracy could be achieved in et0 simulation than the application of single models for both single and multi step modeling this study is limited to the application of three ensemble methods for modeling et0 up to three step ahead hence the proposed ensemble method is suggested to be applied for further steps ahead modeling of et0 to ascertain the accuracy and effectiveness of the method beyond three step ahead modeling moreover the method could also be employed for other hydro climatic parameters modeling as well as inclusion of other black box based methods that were not used in this study in the ensembling unit additionally the use of other models such as anfis svr etc as kernels for ensemble modeling should be tested in future studies credit authorship contribution

5903,using continuous injections of helium coupled to in situ continuous flow membrane inlet mass spectrometry cf mims we mapped the gas exchanges along two low slope headwater streams having discharges of 25 l s 1 and 90 l s 1 mean reaeration rate coefficients k2 were estimated at 130 d 1 and 60 d 1 respectively our study revealed that gas exchanges along headwater streams are highly heterogeneous the variable morphology of the streambed causes gas exchanges to be focused into small areas namely small cascades made up of stones or wood with reaeration rate coefficients up to 40 times higher than in low turbulent zones as such cascades appear to be hot spots for both oxygenation and greenhouse gases emissions additional o2 and co2 measurements effectively showed fast exchanges between the stream and the atmosphere in the cascades following the partial pressure gradients these cascades allow a fast oxygenation of the eutrophic streams depleted in o2 which sustains respiration simultaneously cascades release the oversaturated co2 originating from groundwater inputs to the atmosphere by comparing measured reaeration rate coefficients to ten predictive equations from literature we showed that all equations systematically underestimate reaeration rate coefficients with significantly higher discrepancies in cascades than in low turbulent zones the inadequate characterization of the processes occurring in cascades causes empirical equations to have poor predictive capabilities leading to a global underestimation of co2 emission from headwater streams

water gas exchanges also control co2 ch4 and n2o release or uptake by streams tranvik et al 2009 and thus influence the global greenhouse gas budgets of terrestrial systems global co2 emissions from inland water estimated at 2 9 pgc y 1 are of the same order of magnitude as terrestrial c sinks of 3 1 pgc y 1 among inland water co2 fluxes recent studies highlighted the importance of inputs from headwater streams because of their ubiquity bishop et al 2008 their connection to biologically active compartments and their high level of turbulence duvert et al 2018 natchimuthu et al 2017 öquist et al 2009 wallin et al 2011 crawford et al 2014 showed that even in a lake rich landscape of the northern highland lake district michigan us streams emitted roughly the same co2 mass as lakes the same study highlighted that streams may also be substantial sources of ch4 crawford et al 2014 with respect to warming potential ch4 emissions by streams corresponded to 26 of the total estimated co2 flux all these studies call for a better quantification of greenhouse gas emissions in lower order streams quantification of gas exchanges is also crucial in surface water ecology especially for open channel metabolism calculations aristegi et al 2009 knapp et al 2015 it is a key point in many hydrogeochemical studies as well such as radon based groundwater discharge estimations avery et al 2018

reliable at a large scale or in different settings melching and flores 1999 palumbo and brown 2014 the diversity of empirical equations existing in literature reflects the variability of gas exchanges in headwater catchments lower order streams are characterized by the great diversity in small scale morphological structures including pools riffles and cascades that can change over time and that are difficult to represent at larger scales in larger rivers cascades have been shown to trigger gas exchanges by creating air bubbles cirpka et al 1993 high tracer gas losses have been measured in dams caplow et al 2004 flume experiments have evidenced that spillways and cascades critically increase water oxygenation baylar et al 2006 khdhiri et al 2014 tebbutt 1972 generating gas exchanges that may be several orders of magnitudes higher than in low turbulent channels baylar et al 2006 drops in co2 partial pressure downstream from waterfalls have additionally been shown in studies focused on global carbon budget estimates wallin et al 2011 and on river water hardness in karstic systems chen et al 2004 in most studies focused on headwater streams though a unique gas exchange rate coefficient is estimated for the whole stream whatever the diversity of its hydrodynamic conditions here we focus on headwater streams and investigate the impact of small scale morphological traits on global predictions of gas exchange rate coefficients and co2 evasion fluxes we hypothesize that the heterogeneity of the streambed which is a characteristic feature of headwater streams explains the difficulty in predicting gas exchanges and co2 emissions by coupling continuous helium injections and membrane inlet mass spectrometry we map gas exchanges along two low slope headwater streams that display a diversity of morphological structures we additionally measure dissolved o2 and co2 to characterize the impact of natural cascades and riffles on stream oxygenation and greenhouse gas emissions in headwater catchments 2 material and methods the two headwater streams were selected based on the diversity of their morphological structures i e the presence of low turbulent zones and cascades helium an inert gas tracer and nacl a conservative tracer were injected continuously and monitored at several distances from the injection site using a continuous flow membrane inlet mass spectrometer cf mims and an electrical conductivity ec probe experiments were performed in spring 2018 2 1 study site the two streams belong to a crystalline catchment located in pleine fougères brittany western france kolbe et al 2016 the catchment fig 1 a is part of the long term socio ecological research ltser site zone atelier armorique both streams present typical low slope headwater stream morphologies featuring small cascades and low turbulent areas fig 1c both streams are located in agricultural fields and have riverine vegetation dominated by brambles and diverse herbaceous species such as kentucky bluegrass and buttercups stream a locally called le ronan is a first order stream with a mean depth of 0 16 m a mean width of 0 8 m and a discharge rate of 25 l s 1 as measured by the nacl slug injection performed the day of the experiment stream b le petit hermitage is a second order stream with a mean depth of 0 25 m a mean width of 1 8 m and a discharge rate of 90 l s 1 their streambeds were covered by heterogeneous detrital elements such as coarse grain sediments small rocks and decaying branches which led their small scale morphology to be variable fig 1b the global slope of the streams was deduced from the altitude of the upstream and downstream ends of the reach the precise topography was then determined by measuring the height of each cascade with a tape each reach was divided into several uniform sub reaches e g low turbulent zone cascade reach a total length of 52 m showed a succession of low turbulent zones and small cascades 5 15 cm high it was divided into 6 sub reaches a1 a6 measuring 3 12 m reach b total length of 98 m was flat and homogeneous along its first 95 m and displayed a 35 cm high cascade at its downstream end between 95 and 98 m it was divided into 3 sub reaches b1 b3 two similar segments in the flat zone b1 and b2 and one short segment around the fall b3 fig 1b 2 2 tracer injection helium was chosen as gaseous tracer for the following reasons 1 as a noble gas it is non reactive 2 it is non toxic 3 its concentration in the atmosphere is very low around 5 ppm allowing a high concentration difference between stream and atmosphere during injections 4 it can be accurately measured with cf mims and gas chromatography 5 it is highly volatile increasing the accuracy of degassing estimations 6 it is not expensive 7 unlike other tracers such as sf6 benson et al 2014 it is not a greenhouse gas a non volatile conservative tracer was also needed to account for potential dilution due to groundwater discharge genereux and hemond 1990 kilpatrick et al 1987 tobias et al 2009 we used chloride from nacl which is classically chosen for its low cost and simple use genereux and hemond 1990 genereux and hemond 1992 helium and nacl were injected continuously at a constant rate for 2 h in stream a and for 1 h in stream b helium was injected from a 100 liquid helium bottle through bubbling on the stream bottom supplementary data figure a 1 a precision manometer and a pressure regulator ensured the stability of the injection the background helium concentration of both streams was around 8 10 9 mol l 1 upon injection it increased to 1 10 7 mol l 1 in stream a and to 8 10 7 mol l 1 in stream b 10 kg of nacl were dissolved in a 300 l can filled with stream water the nacl solution was then injected into the stream at a flow rate of 2 l min 1 using a peristaltic pump the background electrical conductivity measured at the injection site before and after the experiments was 270 µs cm 1 in stream a and 204 µs cm 1 in stream b upon injection it increased to 330 µs cm 1 in stream a and to 229 µs cm 1 in stream b 2 3 measurement in situ measurements of helium were performed using continuous flow membrane inlet mass spectrometry cf mims in situ membrane inlet mass spectrometry has been shown to improve the determination of gas exchange rate coefficients based on tracer injections knapp et al 2019 it was also used recently by weber et al 2019 to derive gas exchange rate coefficients from direct measurements of dissolved atmospheric gases the cf mims used here modified from hpr40 hiden analytical is described in details in chatton et al 2017 the gas inlet is ensured by a membrane x44 99 connected to the vacuum of a quadrupole mass spectrometer qms around 10 5 torr allowing the direct permeation of dissolved gases from water to spectrometer inside the qms gases are ionized using an oxide coated iridium filament that allows the selection of ionization energies between 4 and 150 ev and emission intensities between 20 and 5000 μa ionized gases are then separated by the quadrupole according to their mass to charge ratios then the detection of gases is performed either by a faraday cup or a single channel electron multiplier scem the instrumental relative standard deviation is 2 for he and 0 2 for n2 o2 and co2 indicating high measurement sensitivity the spectrometer was installed a few meters away from the stream stream water was pumped continuously mp1 grunfoss pump 5 l min 1 and brought to the spectrometer membrane through a nylon tubing system preventing any contact with the air the pump was attached to a float so that stream water was pumped at a constant depth approximately 10 cm below the surface helium was measured by the spectrometer in real time with a 10 s timestep during injection the pump feeding the cf mims was moved step by step from the downstream end to the upstream end of the reach to map the loss of helium along the stream to make sure that the injection rate was constant the pump was first installed at the downstream end of the reach until helium concentrations reached a stable plateau for 20 min then the pump was moved a few meters upstream to the next measurement location after a few minutes of unstable measurements due to pump and tubing manipulation the helium concentration stabilized at a new stable plateau from that time the pump was maintained at this location during 10 min to gather a significant number of helium measurements 60 70 and make sure the injection rate was constant then the pump was moved upstream to the next measurement location and the procedure was reiterated up to the uppermost measurement location moving the pump upstream avoided perturbation from one measurement location to the next one the stability of the injection and the consistency of the measurements were checked continuously using real time data visualization provided by the in situ cf mims system this system allowed real time mapping of the degassing taking place along the streams major atmospheric gas concentrations n2 o2 ar co2 water vapor pressure h2o and temperature were simultaneously measured with the cf mims to correct helium data for external and instrumental deviations cf mims data expressed in partial pressures in air were converted into concentrations in water by external calibration with micro gas chromatography µgc measurements on grab samples two samples intended for µgc analysis were taken at each location in 500 ml glass bottles to ensure the synchronicity of cf mims and µgc data samples were collected directly at the cf mims outlet the tube filling the glass bottles was immerged in a bucket to avoid any contact with the atmosphere all µgc measurements were performed less than 48 h after sampling the instrument relative standard deviation of the µgc is 3 detailed description of cf mims measurements corrections and the calibration procedure can be found in chatton et al 2017 as a proxy for nacl electrical conductivity was monitored using two hatch probes the relative standard deviation of ec measurements is 5 one ec probe was moved together with the pump the probe and the pump were attached to the same float to ensure they sampled the same water the second ec probe was permanently installed 10 m downstream from the injection site to check the stability of salt injection the experimental set up is summarized in fig 2 2 4 calculation of gas exchange rate coefficient degassing is commonly assumed to be linearly proportional to the air water concentration difference kilpatrick et al 1987 thus the variation in helium concentrations through time can be expressed by the 1d advection dispersion equation 1 c he t u c he x d x 2 c he x 2 k he c he c he eq where che mol l 1 is the helium concentration c he eq mol l 1 is the helium concentration in a stream at equilibrium with the atmosphere khe s 1 is the air water gas exchange rate coefficient of helium u m s 1 is the water velocity and dx m2 s 1 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient since helium has a low atmospheric concentration its equilibrium concentration in stream is low around 8 10 9 mol l 1 thus during helium injections stream helium concentration becomes at least one order of magnitude higher than the equilibrium concentration and c he eq can be neglected the variations in chloride concentrations through time can be expressed using the same advection dispersion equation without the degassing term 2 c cl t u c cl x d x 2 c cl x 2 where ccl mol l 1 is the chloride concentration assuming that the advection and dispersion parameters for chloride are similar than for helium genereux and hemond 1992 tobias et al 2009 wanninkhof et al 1990 combining eqs 1 and 2 leads to the solution proposed by kilpatrick et al 1987 in which dilution effects are taken into account by the ratio in chloride concentrations 3 k he u l ln c he up c he down c cl up c cl down where c he up and c cl up mol l 1 are the upstream concentrations c he down and c cl down mol l 1 are the downstream concentrations u m s 1 is the mean stream velocity and l m is the distance between the two locations the gas exchanges depend on the nature of the gas and on water temperature gas exchange rate coefficients can be scaled from one gas to another using the ratio of their schmidt numbers jähne et al 1987b the schmidt number sc is a dimensionless number corresponding to the ratio of kinematic viscosity to mass diffusivity to enable comparison with previously published results gas exchange rate coefficients calculated for helium khe are scaled to the reaeration rate coefficient k2 defined as the gas exchange rate coefficient for o2 at 20 c 4 k 2 k he sc o 2 sc he 0 5 where sco2 is the schmidt number for oxygen at 20 c and sche is the schmidt number for helium at stream temperature the equations from which the schmidt numbers used in this study were obtained are featured in table 1 2 5 comparison with predictive equations gualtieri et al 2002 performed a dimensional analysis to identify the physical parameters that control gas exchange rate coefficients in streams they showed that gas exchange rate coefficients k d 1 can be expressed as a direct function of the froude number fr the channel slope i the reynolds number re the ratio between the stream depth h m the mean velocity u m s 1 and a dimensionless gas exchange factor λ 5 k u h λ f r i r e with fr u gh re u h ν where g m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration and ν m2 s 1 is the kinematic viscosity gualtieri et al 2002 reformulated 20 empirical and semi empirical equations from literature as a function of these parameters it was shown that all equations physically contain the velocity over depth ratio the slope and the froude number some of them additionally involve the reynolds number their process based analysis pointed out that stream depth is a crucial parameter in any gas exchange rate coefficient equation it influences in the velocity over depth ratio as well as the froude and reynolds numbers thus application of these equations implicitly assumes the existence of a water layer with a well defined thickness in cascades such a layer cannot be defined a cascade can be seen as a succession of a ramp where gas exchanges occur at the free surface of the water layer and a receiving basin in which gas exchanges are controlled by air bubbles cirpka et al 1993 in the ramp section of the cascade the supercritical flow regime implies that the water layer is very thin and uneven in the receiving basin portion of the cascade the falling jet penetrating the water generates high turbulence and uneven flows thus the empirical and semi empirical equations of gas exchange rate coefficient are theoretically not applicable in cascades cirpka et al 1993 developed alternative semi empirical equations to describe gas exchanges specifically within cascades in large rivers their equations account for gas exchanges through the free surface and via air bubbles they rely on four parameters the calibration of which requires extensive in situ tracer experiments with the simultaneous injections of four different gases this raises the question of the suitability of predictive equations for global estimations of gas exchange rate coefficients indeed since most headwater streams display both cascades and low turbulent zones the unreliability of equations in cascades is likely to distort the gas exchange rate coefficient at the stream scale to test if the presence of a few cascades significantly distorts global gas exchange predictions over a stream reach we compared measured k2 values with values calculated using predictive equations developed for small streams table 2 we considered the historical equation of o connor and dobbins 1958 among the many other empirical equations that have been proposed ever since we chose the relationships that were calibrated with the largest datasets the semi empirical equation from melching and flores 1999 is based on a large usgs data set and was further used in several studies haider et al 2013 ritz et al 2017 the seven semi empirical equations from raymond et al 2012 are based on the same usgs data set and on four additional data sets bernot et al 2010 bott et al 2006 mulholland et al 2001 tsivoglou and neal 1976 making them to our knowledge the equations based on the largest amount of data lauerwald et al 2015 we also considered the process based equation proposed by gualtieri and gualtieri 2000 and gualtieri et al 2002 to compare measured gas exchange rate coefficients with gas exchange rate coefficients obtained using predictive equations the hydraulic parameters of each stream were measured supplementary data table a 1 global parameters were evaluated at the reach scale and local parameters were evaluated for each sub reach stream discharge was calculated using a nacl slug injection velocity was measured using a field velocimeter fp111 global water flow probe the slope was derived from the altitude gradient between upper and lower reach ends depth was measured at several points across and along each reach and averaged for each reach 2 6 reactive gases in conjunction with he o2 and co2 were measured by cf mims at several distances from the injection site measurements were externally calibrated using micro gas chromatograph µgc measurements in the same way as for helium in both streams the helium enrichment due to the injection was less than 1 µmol l 1 so it did not induce significant degassing of o2 or co2 in stream b o2 and co2 measurements failed because of a calibration error of the µgc co2 evasion was calculated using the measured co2 concentrations and the gas exchange rate coefficient derived from the helium injection gas exchange rate coefficients were first converted from he to co2 based on the ratio of their schmidt numbers eq 4 the schmidt number for co2 is given in table 1 the co2 evasion rate at the stream atmosphere interface mol m 2 s 1 was then calculated using the flux equation first developed for reaeration by young and huryn 1998 and later derived for co2 evasion billett et al 2004 hope et al 2001 öquist et al 2009 wallin et al 2011 6 co 2 e v a s i o n c o 2 s t r e a m co 2 e q k co 2 q u w where co2 stream is the measured co2 concentration mol l 1

and w is the stream width m 2 7 list of the parameters the parameters used in the paper are listed in table 3 3 results 3 1 gas exchange mapping in both streams a and b measurements at several distances from the injection site show a decrease in helium concentrations from upstream to downstream fig 3 in stream a the helium concentrations decrease from 140 nmol l 1 at 14 m from the injection site to 84 nmol l 1 at 52 m downstream a light rain event occurred at the end of the experiment just before the pump was set up at the most upstream measurement location 9 m the rain increased the gas exchanges at the stream surface ho et al 2000 leading to lower helium concentrations at 9 m 130 nmol l 1 than at 14 m 140 nmol l 1 in stream b helium concentrations decrease from 820 nmol l 1 at 15 m from the injection site to 650 nmol l 1 at 98 m downstream the cf mims semi continuous measurements allowed visualization and quantification of the uncertainty in helium concentration estimates the relative standard deviation rsd of the 60 to 70 measurements available at each distance was comprised between 1 7 and 4 5 in stream a and between 0 9 and 1 5 in stream b attesting the stability of helium concentrations at each location the lower rsd in stream b is probably due to the higher helium injection rate the large number of measurements allows to perform a trend analysis on each plateau it reveals the absence of systematic decrease or increase of the helium concentration upon a plateau supplementary data table a 2 in stream a 4 plateaus have a slight increasing trend and 3 plateaus have a slight decreasing trend in stream b 3 plateaus have a slight increasing trend and one plateau has a slight decreasing trend this suggest an overall stability of the injection rate electrical conductivity can be considered as stable along the streams since its variation from upstream to downstream is lower than the instrumental relative standard deviation ec stability thus shows the absence of major groundwater inputs prone to modify the helium signal in stream a where measurements of o2 and co2 are available the consistency in the variations of he o2 and co2 further confirms the absence of disturbance of the gas content by groundwater inputs co2 concentrations in groundwater as measured at a small spring located 20 m upstream from the injection site reach 650 µmol l 1 that is 30 times the atmospheric equilibrium inputs of such concentrated groundwater along the studied reach would have induced a sharp increase in co2 concentrations in the stream however co2 concentrations follow a general decreasing trend from at 299 µmol l 1 at 14 m to 288 µmol l 1 at 52 m suggesting that there are no major inputs of groundwater along the studied reach salt injections had to be stopped before the end of the experiments because of a deficit in salt injection solution it is unlikely to bias the conclusions reached here as ec does not change between the downstream and upstream ends of each studied reach fig 3 global gas exchange rate coefficients in each stream were calculated using the concentration difference between the most upstream and downstream locations eq 3 since ec does not vary along each stream the ratio between upstream and downstream chloride concentrations is equal to 1 and can be simplified in eq 3 the gas exchange rate coefficient for helium khe was 196 d 1 in stream a and 99 d 1 in stream b corresponding to a reaeration rate coefficient k2 of respectively 130 d 1 and 60 d 1 eq 4 these k2 are in the range of values found by other gas tracer release experiments in headwater streams table 4 the reaeration rate coefficient is significantly higher in the 1st order stream a than in the 2nd order stream b it is consistent with the observations of wallin et al 2011 showing an increase in the rate of co2 degassing with lower stream order for each sub reach reaeration rate coefficients were calculated in the same way as for the full stream reaches helium concentrations and reaeration rate coefficients were then reported as a function of the distance from injection site fig 4 uncertainties in the helium concentrations were estimated by the standard deviations of the 60 to 70 cf mims measurements available for each plateau standard deviations are small fig 4 demonstrating the robustness of the measurements uncertainties in the gas exchange rate coefficients were estimated by randomly subsampling each plateau of helium concentration the gas exchange rate coefficient was calculated using a randomly chosen value of the upstream plateau and a randomly chosen value of the downstream plateau the random sampling was reiterated 1000 times for each sub reach leading to 1000 k2 values the standard deviation of the 1000 k2 values indicated the uncertainty due to helium measurement fig 4 the uncertainty is smaller in stream b than in stream a due to the lower noise level in stream b a big advantage of the continuous measurements with in situ cf mims is that it produces a significant number of measurements which allows to visualize and quantify the uncertainties for the sub reaches where ec was available the uncertainty due to ec measurements was quantified in the same way by sub sampling ec values from each plateau taking into account the uncertainty due to ec measurements increased the standard deviation by 50 in sub reach a5 by 8 in sub reach a6 and by 10 in sub reach b3 thus the uncertainty due to ec measurements is lower than the uncertainty due to helium measurements but is not negligible when possible we recommend using a fluorescent dye as conservative tracer rather than nacl the measurement accuracy of fluorescent dyes is usually higher and florescent dyes are not present naturally in water which lowers the overall uncertainty on gas exchange rate coefficients the gas exchanges are heterogeneously distributed along the streams in stream a k2 increases by a factor of 6 from the less turbulent zones k2 a2 50 d 1 k2 a4 70 d 1 to the highest cascade k2 a5 360 d 1 intermediary values are found in the sub reach displaying three successive small cascades k2 a3 220 d 1 and in the agitated sub reach with no identifiable cascade k2 a6 140 d 1 thus reaeration rate coefficients are ranked according to the level of turbulence in stream b the range of reaeration rate coefficients is larger the reaeration rate coefficient is 40 times higher in the cascade k2 b3 1030 d 1 than in the flat area k2 b1 k2 b2 25 d 1 note that the first two sub reaches b1 and b2 presenting visually the same morphological characteristics have the same k2 values which supports the reliability of the method this mapping of gas exchanges evidences a high heterogeneity of degassing along the streams exchanges are strongly focused in cascades a 35 cm high cascade loses as much gas as an 80 m long low turbulent reach 3 2 suitability of predictive equations the ten predictive equations given in table 2 were applied to the streams a and b using the hydraulic parameters given in table a 1 at the reach scale the ten predictive equations systematically underestimate reaeration rate coefficients by a factor comprised between 1 2 and 4 fig 5 reaeration rate coefficients were also calculated for each sub reach using the local hydraulic parameters the mean and standard deviation of the ten predicted k2 values obtained with the ten equations of table 2 are given in table 5 on average predictive equations strongly underestimate gas exchanges in the cascade sub reaches while they are consistent in low turbulent zones the spread of the k2 values given by the different equations indicated by their standard deviation is also significantly higher in cascades than in low turbulent zones elevated differences between predicted and measured k2 values in cascades are due to the fact that physically predictive equations are non reliable in high turbulent zones section 2 5 they are based on parameters that are highly difficult to measure in cascades such as the stream depth the underestimation of predicted reaeration rate coefficients in cascades significantly biases the predictions at the full reach scale leading to a systematic underestimation of global gas exchanges 3 3 impacts on reactive gases with a mean concentration of around 290 µmol l 1 stream a is oversaturated in co2 in the sense that it contains 10 times more co2 than it would at equilibrium with the atmosphere fig 6 co2 oversaturation is frequent in headwater streams because of inputs of groundwater that are highly concentrated in co2 due to the aerobic degradation of organic matter cole et al 2007 water rock interaction can also be a source of co2 in streams especially in karst regions chen et al 2004 the large excess of co2 in stream a originates from a small spring that flows 20 m upstream from the injection site the spring water has a co2 concentration reaching 650 µmol l 1 which is 30 times higher than the atmospheric equilibrium contrariwise stream a shows an undersaturation in o2 fig 6 its o2 concentration is comprised between 280 and 300 µmol l 1 while at equilibrium with the atmosphere it would be 344 µmol l 1 undersaturation in o2 is common in headwater streams because they are mostly net heterotrophs knapp et al 2015 riley and dodds 2012 young and huryn 1999 in cascades the state of the stream is rapidly modified by strong exchanges of gas following partial pressure gradients co2 oversaturation induces significant drops in co2 in cascades while o2 undersaturation induces gains in o2 fig 6 release of co2 to the atmosphere as well as stream oxygenation mainly occurs in the cascades note that the rain event that occurred when the pump was at 9 m from the injection site increased gas exchanges leading to a drop in co2 concentration and an increase in o2 concentration based on the mean co2 concentration of stream a and the gas exchange rate coefficient measured with helium and converted to co2 eq 4 we estimated the global co2 evasion rate of stream a at 47 µmol m 2 s 1 eq 6 this corresponds to 48 gc m 2 d 1 which is close to the evasion rate of 56 gc m 2 d 1 that was measured in a canadian steep headwater stream by direct co2 injections mcdowell and johnson 2018 the co2 evasion rate of stream a was also calculated using the gas exchange rate coefficients predicted by the empirical equations of table 2 it yielded systematically lower co2 evasion rates comprised between 16 and 44 gc m 2 d 1 table 6 thus the underestimation of gas exchange rate coefficients by empirical equations section 3 2 leads to a significant underestimation of the co2 flux from headwater streams if co2 concentrations in the stream were modified solely by gas exchanges with the atmosphere the calculated evasion rate of 48 gc m 2 d 1 would imply a decrease of 50 µmol l 1 in the co2 concentration between the upstream and the downstream end of the reach a this is higher than the measured net loss of co2 close to 20 µmol l 1 fig 6 showing that other processes such as oxygenic respiration partly counterbalance the loss of co2 to the atmosphere it highlights that the co2 evasion rates cannot be derived directly from the changes in co2 concentration along the streams 4 discussion 4 1 predictions of gas exchanges comparison between measured and predicted k2 values demonstrates that the presence of a few cascades along a stream significantly biases global predictions of gas exchange leading to a systematic underestimation of reaeration rate coefficients this is consistent with the study of ulseth et al 2019 showing at stream scale that empirical models underestimate gas exchanges in high channel slope streams mcdowell and johnson 2018 also highlighted when studying a headwater stream that models underestimate gas exchange rate coefficients for high k values processes governing gas exchanges in cascades fundamentally differ from those in flowing sections section 2 5 in cascades air bubbles have a strong control over gas exchanges chanson 1995 chanson and toombes 2002 cirpka et al 1993 overlooking specific processes occurring in cascades leads to an underestimation of gas exchanges in headwater catchments where shallow streams often display natural cascades increasing the reliability of predictions would require separate consideration of low turbulent zones and cascades for low turbulent stream sections our study confirms the predictive capacities of the empirical and semi empirical equations of table 2 for cascades predictions are more challenging and require additional morphological characterization or field experiments studies focused on spillways in flumes baylar et al 2006 essery et al 1978 gameson 1957 gulliver et al 1998 khdhiri et al 2014 tebbutt 1972 toombes and chanson 2005 and on dams caplow et al 2004 gamlin et al 2001 or cascades cirpka et al 1993 in rivers use the aeration efficiency e instead of the gas exchange rate coefficient k aeration efficiency was defined by gameson 1957 and represents the total change in gas concentration occurring in the cascade normalized by the air water concentration gradient 7 e c down c up c eq c up where cup mol l 1 is the upstream concentration cdown mol l 1 is the downstream concentration and ceq mol l 1 is the dissolved gas concentration at equilibrium with the atmosphere equations derived from lab experiments predict aeration efficiency as a function of cascade total height and if applicable of additional morphological parameters of the cascade such as the height of intermediate steps or the angle of the weir baylar and bagatur 2006 baylar et al 2006 baylar et al 2011 essery et al 1978 khdhiri et al 2014 the morphological characteristics of the hydraulic structure seem to be more reliable to predict aeration in cascades than the depth of the water layer however if these morphological characteristics are well defined in flumes they are much harder to describe properly in natural streams where cascades are made up of heterogeneous stones and pieces of wood for more accurate gas exchange quantification direct measurements remain necessary in cascades 4 2 impact of cascades on groundwater discharge estimates groundwater discharge in streams is commonly quantified using the natural gas tracer 222rn some authors like gilfedder et al 2019 and cartwright et al 2014 raised the question of the impact of the variability of turbulence on 222rn degassing rate and thus on groundwater discharge estimation our study points out that cascades by generating a fast equilibration between the stream and the atmosphere erase an important part of the gaseous groundwater signal in the stream e g rn he ar co2 ch4 n2 n2o a cascade that is a few tens of centimeters high can lose as much gas as a hundred meter long stream since such cascades are very common in low order streams this is prone to yield an underestimation of the groundwater discharge calculated by 222rn mass balances the location of the cascades should be taken into account when defining the 222rn sampling strategy and their number and size between the up and down 222rn sampling locations should be minimized our results suggest that in reaches without notable cascades one can reasonably calculate the 222rn degassing rate with empirical equations in reaches displaying notable cascades however direct gas tracer experiments appear to be necessary 4 3 hot spots of reaeration studies based on flume experiments recommend the use of dams in rivers subject to eutrophication to enhance water reaeration tebbutt 1972 our study shows that natural cascades significantly increase the oxygenation of headwater streams in this way they might strongly help sustaining aerobic metabolism and thus provide a crucial ecosystem service in headwater catchment subject to eutrophication dodds and smith 2016 garnier and billen 2007 considered as reaeration hot spots small cascades have the potential to enhance measurably the ecological conditions of eutrophic streams and might thus be considered in management and restoration strategies palmer et al 2005 4 4 hot spots of co2 emission most headwater streams are net sources of atmospheric co2 cole et al 2007 marx et al 2017 indeed organic matter respiration occurring in the contributing compartments aquifer hyporheic zone soil and in the stream network itself is often responsible for an oversaturation in co2 cole et al 2007 compared to the equilibrium with the atmosphere drops in co2 partial pressure in water after cascades and highly turbulent zones have been evidenced in headwater streams duvert et al 2018 leibowitz et al 2017 natchimuthu et al 2017 in karst systems these drops have been linked to water softening chen et al 2004 at a much bigger scale liu et al 2017 showed that co2 outgassing from low gradient large rivers was strongly controlled by the geomorphology here by simultaneously mapping the loss of a gas tracer and the changes in co2 concentration along a headwater stream we establish a direct link between streambed morphology gas exchanges and co2 release to the atmosphere we show that cascades significantly enhance gas exchanges leading to a fast co2 release to the atmosphere in a study focused on the temporal variability of gas exchanges mcdowell and johnson 2018 showed that 84 of co2 emissions from a steep headwater stream occurred when discharge was higher than the median they suggested that high flow events because they increase turbulence can be seen as hot moments of co2 emission in headwater streams mcclain et al 2003 here we highlight the spatial variability of co2 emissions and show that similarly by increasing gas exchanges cascades can be viewed as hot spots of co2 emission in headwater streams if we assume that the 19 km long first order stream network of our 35 km2 catchment has the same co2 emission rate as the studied stream a a rough estimate of the total evasion of co2 over all first order streams of the catchment can be calculated we limit the upscaling to the first order stream network of a small catchment in which we assume that on average cascades have the frequency and the size of those of stream a predictive equations from table 2 would lead to a total co2 emission comprised between 150 and 300 tc year 1 with the mean of the outputs from the ten equations being 220 tc year 1 while the measured gas exchange rate leads to a co2 emission of 330 tc year 1 such a rough first order estimation indicates that the prediction of gas exchange rate coefficients at a large scale with empirical equations is likely to induce a general underestimation of co2 emission from headwater catchments similarly empirical equations probably lead to an underestimation of the emission of other greenhouse gases such as ch4 5 conclusion using continuous helium injection we mapped gas exchanges along two low slope headwater streams in a temperate catchment in brittany france our experimental set up took advantage of the real time data visualization allowed by the in situ cf mims it highlights the new opportunities offered by this technology in terms of spatial as well as temporal characterization of gas exchange processes the semi continuous measurements allow to visualize and to quantify the uncertainties we evidenced a high spatial variability of gas exchanges related to the small scale heterogeneity of the streambed morphology which is a characteristic feature of headwater streams during one of our tracer tests a small cascade was responsible for almost half of the helium loss while it occupied less than 4 of the total stream length nevertheless the equations predicting the gas exchange rate coefficients in headwater streams do not account for the specific processes governing gas exchanges in natural cascades as a result while empirical relationships perform well in low turbulent zones they systematically underestimate gas exchange rate coefficients as soon as small cascades are present this highlights the necessity of performing direct measurements of gas exchange rate coefficients in reaches displaying cascades while low turbulent zones can be efficiently characterized by empirical equations additional co2 and o2 measurements highlighted that small cascades strongly modify the chemical state of headwater streams high gas exchange rate coefficients allow a fast incorporation of o2 in the water and a fast release of co2 to the atmosphere thus cascades sustain respiration by rebalancing o2 concentrations in the stream at the same time they promote the evasion of the oversaturated co2 to the atmosphere finally small natural cascades are hot spots for both stream oxygenation and greenhouse gas emission rough calculations of co2 emissions showed that the use of empirical equations leads to an underestimation of global co2 emissions from headwater streams since the small scale morphological heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of headwater streams the upscaling effort could be helped by a distinct consideration of cascades and low turbulent sections the first step would be to separately characterize gas exchange processes in these totally different hydrodynamic regimes the second step would be to estimate the proportion of these two regimes in the stream network this could be helped by innovative technologies such as lidar allowing a fine scale characterization of the

5903,using continuous injections of helium coupled to in situ continuous flow membrane inlet mass spectrometry cf mims we mapped the gas exchanges along two low slope headwater streams having discharges of 25 l s 1 and 90 l s 1 mean reaeration rate coefficients k2 were estimated at 130 d 1 and 60 d 1 respectively our study revealed that gas exchanges along headwater streams are highly heterogeneous the variable morphology of the streambed causes gas exchanges to be focused into small areas namely small cascades made up of stones or wood with reaeration rate coefficients up to 40 times higher than in low turbulent zones as such cascades appear to be hot spots for both oxygenation and greenhouse gases emissions additional o2 and co2 measurements effectively showed fast exchanges between the stream and the atmosphere in the cascades following the partial pressure gradients these cascades allow a fast oxygenation of the eutrophic streams depleted in o2 which sustains respiration simultaneously cascades release the oversaturated co2 originating from groundwater inputs to the atmosphere by comparing measured reaeration rate coefficients to ten predictive equations from literature we showed that all equations systematically underestimate reaeration rate coefficients with significantly higher discrepancies in cascades than in low turbulent zones the inadequate characterization of the processes occurring in cascades causes empirical equations to have poor predictive capabilities leading to a global underestimation of co2 emission from headwater streams keywords headwater stream membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims reaeration gas exchange greenhouse gas emission co2 evasion 1 introduction streams continuously exchange gases with the atmosphere the reaeration process which characterizes the exchange of oxygen between streams and atmosphere provides ecosystem services by sustaining in stream respiration aristegi et al 2009 knapp et al 2015 air water gas exchanges also control co2 ch4 and n2o release or uptake by streams tranvik et al 2009 and thus influence the global greenhouse gas budgets of terrestrial systems global co2 emissions from inland water estimated at 2 9 pgc y 1 are of the same order of magnitude as terrestrial c sinks of 3 1 pgc y 1 among inland water co2 fluxes recent studies highlighted the importance of inputs from headwater streams because of their ubiquity bishop et al 2008 their connection to biologically active compartments and their high level of turbulence duvert et al 2018 natchimuthu et al 2017 öquist et al 2009 wallin et al 2011 crawford et al 2014 showed that even in a lake rich landscape of the northern highland lake district michigan us streams emitted roughly the same co2 mass as lakes the same study highlighted that streams may also be substantial sources of ch4 crawford et al 2014 with respect to warming potential ch4 emissions by streams corresponded to 26 of the total estimated co2 flux all these studies call for a better quantification of greenhouse gas emissions in lower order streams quantification of gas exchanges is also crucial in surface water ecology especially for open channel metabolism calculations aristegi et al 2009 knapp et al 2015 it is a key point in many hydrogeochemical studies as well such as radon based groundwater discharge estimations avery et al 2018 cartwright et al 2014 cook et al 2003 gilfedder et al 2019 gleeson et al 2018 gas exchange rate coefficients can be measured directly by performing gas tracer release experiments benson et al 2014 genereux and hemond 1992 hall and madinger 2018 knapp et al 2019 wanninkhof et al 1990 inert gases such as propane sf6 or helium are injected in the stream often in conjunction with a non volatile tracer to account for dispersion and dilution effects since these injections are time and cost intensive predictive equations either empirical churchill et al 1964 goncalves et al 2017 melching and flores 1999 tsivoglou and neal 1976 or process based gualtieri and gualtieri 2000 gualtieri et al 2002 have been developed to propose straightforward estimates of gas exchange rate coefficients the gas exchange rate coefficients are expressed as a function of hydrodynamic characteristics such as water depth flow velocity slope discharge and in some cases dimensionless numbers e g froude reynolds sherwood numbers a wide diversity of equations may be found in literature but each equation appears to be specific to the hydrological conditions for which it has been defined making them poorly reliable at a large scale or in different settings melching and flores 1999 palumbo and brown 2014 the diversity of empirical equations existing in literature reflects the variability of gas exchanges in headwater catchments lower order streams are characterized by the great diversity in small scale morphological structures including pools riffles and cascades that can change over time and that are difficult to represent at larger scales in larger rivers cascades have been shown to trigger gas exchanges by creating air bubbles cirpka et al 1993 high tracer gas losses have been measured in dams caplow et al 2004 flume experiments have evidenced that spillways and cascades critically increase water oxygenation baylar et al 2006 khdhiri et al 2014 tebbutt 1972 generating gas exchanges that may be several orders of magnitudes higher than in low turbulent channels baylar et al 2006 drops in co2 partial pressure downstream from waterfalls have additionally been shown in studies focused on global carbon budget estimates wallin et al 2011 and on river water hardness in karstic systems chen et al 2004 in most studies focused on headwater streams though a unique gas exchange rate coefficient is estimated for the whole stream whatever the diversity of its hydrodynamic conditions here we focus on headwater streams and investigate the impact of small scale morphological traits on global predictions of gas exchange rate coefficients and co2 evasion fluxes we hypothesize that the heterogeneity of the streambed which is a characteristic feature of headwater streams explains the difficulty in predicting gas exchanges and co2 emissions by coupling continuous helium injections and membrane inlet mass spectrometry we map gas exchanges along two low slope headwater streams that display a diversity of morphological structures we additionally measure dissolved o2 and co2 to characterize the impact of natural cascades and riffles on stream oxygenation and greenhouse gas emissions in headwater catchments 2 material and methods the two headwater streams were selected based on the diversity of their morphological structures i e the presence of low turbulent zones and cascades helium an inert gas tracer and nacl a conservative tracer were injected continuously and monitored at several distances from the injection site using a continuous flow membrane inlet mass spectrometer cf mims and an electrical conductivity ec probe experiments were performed in spring 2018 2 1 study site the two streams belong to a crystalline catchment located in pleine fougères brittany western france kolbe et al 2016 the catchment fig 1 a is part of the long term socio ecological research ltser site zone atelier armorique both streams present typical low slope headwater stream morphologies featuring small cascades and low turbulent areas fig 1c both streams are located in agricultural fields and have riverine vegetation dominated by brambles and diverse herbaceous species such as kentucky bluegrass and buttercups stream a locally called le ronan is a first order stream with a mean depth of 0 16 m a mean width of 0 8 m and a discharge rate of 25 l s 1 as measured by the nacl slug injection performed the day of the experiment stream b le petit hermitage is a second order stream with a mean depth of 0 25 m a mean width of 1 8 m and a discharge rate of 90 l s 1 their streambeds were covered by heterogeneous detrital elements such as coarse grain sediments small rocks and decaying branches which led their small scale morphology to be variable fig 1b the global slope of the streams was deduced from the altitude of the upstream and downstream ends of the reach the precise topography was then determined by measuring the height of each cascade with a tape each reach was divided into several uniform sub reaches e g low turbulent zone cascade reach a total length of 52 m showed a succession of low turbulent zones and small cascades 5 15 cm high it was divided into 6 sub reaches a1 a6 measuring 3 12 m reach b total length of 98 m was flat and homogeneous along its first 95 m and displayed a 35 cm high cascade at its downstream end between 95 and 98 m it was divided into 3 sub reaches b1 b3 two similar segments in the flat zone b1 and b2 and one short segment around the fall b3 fig 1b 2 2 tracer injection helium was chosen as gaseous tracer for the following reasons 1 as a noble gas it is non reactive 2 it is non toxic 3 its concentration in the atmosphere is very low around 5 ppm allowing a high concentration difference between stream and atmosphere during injections 4 it can be accurately measured with cf mims and gas chromatography 5 it is highly volatile increasing the accuracy of degassing estimations 6 it is not expensive 7 unlike other tracers such as sf6 benson et al 2014 it is not a greenhouse gas a non volatile conservative tracer was also needed to account for potential dilution due to groundwater discharge genereux and hemond 1990 kilpatrick et al 1987 tobias et al 2009 we used chloride from nacl which is classically chosen for its low cost and simple use genereux and hemond 1990 genereux and hemond 1992 helium and nacl were injected continuously at a constant rate for 2 h in stream a and for 1 h in stream b helium was injected from a 100 liquid helium bottle through bubbling on the stream bottom supplementary data figure a 1 a precision manometer and a pressure regulator ensured the stability of the injection the background helium concentration of both streams was around 8 10 9 mol l 1 upon injection it increased to 1 10 7 mol l 1 in stream a and to 8 10 7 mol l 1 in stream b 10 kg of nacl were dissolved in a 300 l can filled with stream water the nacl solution was then injected into the stream at a flow rate of 2 l min 1 using a peristaltic pump the background electrical conductivity measured at the injection site before and after the experiments was 270 µs cm 1 in stream a and 204 µs cm 1 in stream b upon injection it increased to 330 µs cm 1 in stream a and to 229 µs cm 1 in stream b 2 3 measurement in situ measurements of helium were performed using continuous flow membrane inlet mass spectrometry cf mims in situ membrane inlet mass spectrometry has been shown to improve the determination of gas exchange rate coefficients based on tracer injections knapp et al 2019 it was also used recently by weber et al 2019 to derive gas exchange rate coefficients from direct measurements of dissolved atmospheric gases the cf mims used here modified from hpr40 hiden analytical is described in details in chatton et al 2017 the gas inlet is ensured by a membrane x44 99 connected to the vacuum of a quadrupole mass spectrometer qms around 10 5 torr allowing the direct permeation of dissolved gases from water to spectrometer inside the qms gases are ionized using an oxide coated iridium filament that allows the selection of ionization energies between 4 and 150 ev and emission intensities between 20 and 5000 μa ionized gases are then separated by the quadrupole according to their mass to charge ratios then the detection of gases is performed either by a faraday cup or a single channel electron multiplier scem the instrumental relative standard deviation is 2 for he and 0 2 for n2 o2 and co2 indicating high measurement sensitivity the spectrometer was installed a few meters away from the stream stream water was pumped continuously mp1 grunfoss pump 5 l min 1 and brought to the spectrometer membrane through a nylon tubing system preventing any contact with the air the pump was attached to a float so that stream water was pumped at a constant depth approximately 10 cm below the surface helium was measured by the spectrometer in real time with a 10 s timestep during injection the pump feeding the cf mims was moved step by step from the downstream end to the upstream end of the reach to map the loss of helium along the stream to make sure that the injection rate was constant the pump was first installed at the downstream end of the reach until helium concentrations reached a stable plateau for 20 min then the pump was moved a few meters upstream to the next measurement location after a few minutes of unstable measurements due to pump and tubing manipulation the helium concentration stabilized at a new stable plateau from that time the pump was maintained at this location during 10 min to gather a significant number of helium measurements 60 70 and make sure the injection rate was constant then the pump was moved upstream to the next measurement location and the procedure was reiterated up to the uppermost measurement location moving the pump upstream avoided perturbation from one measurement location to the next one the stability of the injection and the consistency of the measurements were checked continuously using real time data visualization provided by the in situ cf mims system this system allowed real time mapping of the degassing taking place along the streams major atmospheric gas concentrations n2 o2 ar co2 water vapor pressure h2o and temperature were simultaneously measured with the cf mims to correct helium data for external and instrumental deviations cf mims data expressed in partial pressures in air were converted into concentrations in water by external calibration with micro gas chromatography µgc measurements on grab samples two samples intended for µgc analysis were taken at each location in 500 ml glass bottles to ensure the synchronicity of cf mims and µgc data samples were collected directly at the cf mims outlet the tube filling the glass bottles was immerged in a bucket to avoid any contact with the atmosphere all µgc measurements were performed less than 48 h after sampling the instrument relative standard deviation of the µgc is 3 detailed description of cf mims measurements corrections and the calibration procedure can be found in chatton et al 2017 as a proxy for nacl electrical conductivity was monitored using two hatch probes the relative standard deviation of ec measurements is 5 one ec probe was moved together with the pump the probe and the pump were attached to the same float to ensure they sampled the same water the second ec probe was permanently installed 10 m downstream from the injection site to check the stability of salt injection the experimental set up is summarized in fig 2 2 4 calculation of gas exchange rate coefficient degassing is commonly assumed to be linearly proportional to the air water concentration difference kilpatrick et al 1987 thus the variation in helium concentrations through time can be expressed by the 1d advection dispersion equation 1 c he t u c he x d x 2 c he x 2 k he c he c he eq where che mol l 1 is the helium concentration c he eq mol l 1 is the helium concentration in a stream at equilibrium with the atmosphere khe s 1 is the air water gas exchange rate coefficient of helium u m s 1 is the water velocity and dx m2 s 1 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient since helium has a low atmospheric concentration its equilibrium concentration in stream is low around 8 10 9 mol l 1 thus during helium injections stream helium concentration becomes at least one order of magnitude higher than the equilibrium concentration and c he eq can be neglected the variations in chloride concentrations through time can be expressed using the same advection dispersion equation without the degassing term 2 c cl t u c cl x d x 2 c cl x 2 where ccl mol l 1 is the chloride concentration assuming that the advection and dispersion parameters for chloride are similar than for helium genereux and hemond 1992 tobias et al 2009 wanninkhof et al 1990 combining eqs 1 and 2 leads to the solution proposed by kilpatrick et al 1987 in which dilution effects are taken into account by the ratio in chloride concentrations 3 k he u l ln c he up c he down c cl up c cl down where c he up and c cl up mol l 1 are the upstream concentrations c he down and c cl down mol l 1 are the downstream concentrations u m s 1 is the mean stream velocity and l m is the distance between the two locations the gas exchanges depend on the nature of the gas and on water temperature gas exchange rate coefficients can be scaled from one gas to another using the ratio of their schmidt numbers jähne et al 1987b the schmidt number sc is a dimensionless number corresponding to the ratio of kinematic viscosity to mass diffusivity to enable comparison with previously published results gas exchange rate coefficients calculated for helium khe are scaled to the reaeration rate coefficient k2 defined as the gas exchange rate coefficient for o2 at 20 c 4 k 2 k he sc o 2 sc he 0 5 where sco2 is the schmidt number for oxygen at 20 c and sche is the schmidt number for helium at stream temperature the equations from which the schmidt numbers used in this study were obtained are featured in table 1 2 5 comparison with predictive equations gualtieri et al 2002 performed a dimensional analysis to identify the physical parameters that control gas exchange rate coefficients in streams they showed that gas exchange rate coefficients k d 1 can be expressed as a direct function of the froude number fr the channel slope i the reynolds number re the ratio between the stream depth h m the mean velocity u m s 1 and a dimensionless gas exchange factor λ 5 k u h λ f r i r e with fr u gh re u h ν where g m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration and ν m2 s 1 is the kinematic viscosity gualtieri et al 2002 reformulated 20 empirical and semi empirical equations from literature as a function of these parameters it was shown that all equations physically contain the velocity over depth ratio the slope and the froude number some of them additionally involve the reynolds number their process based analysis pointed out that stream depth is a crucial parameter in any gas exchange rate coefficient equation it influences in the velocity over depth ratio as well as the froude and reynolds numbers thus application of these equations implicitly assumes the existence of a water layer with a well defined thickness in cascades such a layer cannot be defined a cascade can be seen as a succession of a ramp where gas exchanges occur at the free surface of the water layer and a receiving basin in which gas exchanges are controlled by air bubbles cirpka et al 1993 in the ramp section of the cascade the supercritical flow regime implies that the water layer is very thin and uneven in the receiving basin portion of the cascade the falling jet penetrating the water generates high turbulence and uneven flows thus the empirical and semi empirical equations of gas exchange rate coefficient are theoretically not applicable in cascades cirpka et al 1993 developed alternative semi empirical equations to describe gas exchanges specifically within cascades in large rivers their equations account for gas exchanges through the free surface and via air bubbles they rely on four parameters the calibration of which requires extensive in situ tracer experiments with the simultaneous injections of four different gases this raises the question of the suitability of predictive equations for global estimations of gas exchange rate coefficients indeed since most headwater streams display both cascades and low turbulent zones the unreliability of equations in cascades is likely to distort the gas exchange rate coefficient at the stream scale to test if the presence of a few cascades significantly distorts global gas exchange predictions over a stream reach we compared measured k2 values with values calculated using predictive equations developed for small streams table 2 we considered the historical equation of o connor and dobbins 1958 among the many other empirical equations that have been proposed ever since we chose the relationships that were calibrated with the largest datasets the semi empirical equation from melching and flores 1999 is based on a large usgs data set and was further used in several studies haider et al 2013 ritz et al 2017 the seven semi empirical equations from raymond et al 2012 are based on the same usgs data set and on four additional data sets bernot et al 2010 bott et al 2006 mulholland et al 2001 tsivoglou and neal 1976 making them to our knowledge the equations based on the largest amount of data lauerwald et al 2015 we also considered the process based equation proposed by gualtieri and gualtieri 2000 and gualtieri et al 2002 to compare measured gas exchange rate coefficients with gas exchange rate coefficients obtained using predictive equations the hydraulic parameters of each stream were measured supplementary data table a 1 global parameters were evaluated at the reach scale and local parameters were evaluated for each sub reach stream discharge was calculated using a nacl slug injection velocity was measured using a field velocimeter fp111 global water flow probe the slope was derived from the altitude gradient between upper and lower reach ends depth was measured at several points across and along each reach and averaged for each reach 2 6 reactive gases in conjunction with he o2 and co2 were measured by cf mims at several distances from the injection site measurements were externally calibrated using micro gas chromatograph µgc measurements in the same way as for helium in both streams the helium enrichment due to the injection was less than 1 µmol l 1 so it did not induce significant degassing of o2 or co2 in stream b o2 and co2 measurements failed because of a calibration error of the µgc co2 evasion was calculated using the measured co2 concentrations and the gas exchange rate coefficient derived from the helium injection gas exchange rate coefficients were first converted from he to co2 based on the ratio of their schmidt numbers eq 4 the schmidt number for co2 is given in table 1 the co2 evasion rate at the stream atmosphere interface mol m 2 s 1 was then calculated using the flux equation first developed for reaeration by young and huryn 1998 and later derived for co2

distances from the injection site show a decrease in helium concentrations from upstream to downstream fig 3 in stream a the helium concentrations decrease from 140 nmol l 1 at 14 m from the injection site to 84 nmol l 1 at 52 m downstream a light rain event occurred at the end of the experiment just before the pump was set up at the most upstream measurement location 9 m the rain increased the gas exchanges at the stream surface ho et al 2000 leading to lower helium concentrations at 9 m 130 nmol l 1 than at 14 m 140 nmol l 1 in stream b helium concentrations decrease from 820 nmol l 1 at 15 m from the injection site to 650 nmol l 1 at 98 m downstream the cf mims semi continuous measurements allowed visualization and quantification of the uncertainty in helium concentration estimates the relative standard deviation rsd of the 60 to 70 measurements available at each distance was comprised between 1 7 and 4 5 in stream a and between 0 9 and 1 5 in stream b attesting the stability of helium concentrations at each location the lower rsd in stream b is probably due to the higher helium injection rate the large number of measurements allows to perform a trend analysis on each plateau it reveals the absence of systematic decrease or increase of the helium concentration upon a plateau supplementary data table a 2 in stream a 4 plateaus have a slight increasing trend and 3 plateaus have a slight decreasing trend in stream b 3 plateaus have a slight increasing trend and one plateau has a slight decreasing trend this suggest an overall stability of the injection rate electrical conductivity can be considered as stable along the streams since its variation from upstream to downstream is lower than the instrumental relative standard deviation ec stability thus shows the absence of major groundwater inputs prone to modify the helium signal in stream a where measurements of o2 and co2 are available the consistency in the variations of he o2 and co2 further confirms the absence of disturbance of the gas content by groundwater inputs co2 concentrations in groundwater as measured at a small spring located 20 m upstream from the injection site reach 650 µmol l 1 that is 30 times the atmospheric equilibrium inputs of such concentrated groundwater along the studied reach would have induced a sharp increase in co2 concentrations in the stream however co2 concentrations follow a general decreasing trend from at 299 µmol l 1 at 14 m to 288 µmol l 1 at 52 m suggesting that there are no major inputs of groundwater along the studied reach salt injections had to be stopped before the end of the experiments because of a deficit in salt injection solution it is unlikely to bias the conclusions reached here as ec does not change between the downstream and upstream ends of each studied reach fig 3 global gas exchange rate coefficients in each stream were calculated using the concentration difference between the most upstream and downstream locations eq 3 since ec does not vary along each stream the ratio between upstream and downstream chloride concentrations is equal to 1 and can be simplified in eq 3 the gas exchange rate coefficient for helium khe was 196 d 1 in stream a and 99 d 1 in stream b corresponding to a reaeration rate coefficient k2 of respectively 130 d 1 and 60 d 1 eq 4 these k2 are in the range of values found by other gas tracer release experiments in headwater streams table 4 the reaeration rate coefficient is significantly higher in the 1st order stream a than in the 2nd order stream b it is consistent with the observations of wallin et al 2011 showing an increase in the rate of co2 degassing with lower stream order for each sub reach reaeration rate coefficients were calculated in the same way as for the full stream reaches helium concentrations and reaeration rate coefficients were then reported as a function of the distance from injection site fig 4 uncertainties in the helium concentrations were estimated by the standard deviations of the 60 to 70 cf mims measurements available for each plateau standard deviations are small fig 4 demonstrating the robustness of the measurements uncertainties in the gas exchange rate coefficients were estimated by randomly subsampling each plateau of helium concentration the gas exchange rate coefficient was calculated using a randomly chosen value of the upstream plateau and a randomly chosen value of the downstream plateau the random sampling was reiterated 1000 times for each sub reach leading to 1000 k2 values the standard deviation of the 1000 k2 values indicated the uncertainty due to helium measurement fig 4 the uncertainty is smaller in stream b than in stream a due to the lower noise level in stream b a big advantage of the continuous measurements with in situ cf mims is that it produces a significant number of measurements which allows to visualize and quantify the uncertainties for the sub reaches where ec was available the uncertainty due to ec measurements was quantified in the same way by sub sampling ec values from each plateau taking into account the uncertainty due to ec measurements increased the standard deviation by 50 in sub reach a5 by 8 in sub reach a6 and by 10 in sub reach b3 thus the uncertainty due to ec measurements is lower than the uncertainty due to helium measurements but is not negligible when possible we recommend using a fluorescent dye as conservative tracer rather than nacl the measurement accuracy of fluorescent dyes is usually higher and florescent dyes are not present naturally in water which lowers the overall uncertainty on gas exchange rate coefficients the gas exchanges are heterogeneously distributed along the streams in stream a k2 increases by a factor of 6 from the less turbulent zones k2 a2 50 d 1 k2 a4 70 d 1 to the highest cascade k2 a5 360 d 1 intermediary values are found in the sub reach displaying three successive small cascades k2 a3 220 d 1 and in the agitated sub reach with no identifiable cascade k2 a6 140 d 1 thus reaeration rate coefficients are ranked according to the level of turbulence in stream b the range of reaeration rate coefficients is larger the reaeration rate coefficient is 40 times higher in the cascade k2 b3 1030 d 1 than in the flat area k2 b1 k2 b2 25 d 1 note that the first two sub reaches b1 and b2 presenting visually the same morphological characteristics have the same k2 values which supports the reliability of the method this mapping of gas exchanges evidences a high heterogeneity of degassing along the streams exchanges are strongly focused in cascades a 35 cm high cascade loses as much gas as an 80 m long low turbulent reach 3 2 suitability of predictive equations the ten predictive equations given in table 2 were applied to the streams a and b using the hydraulic parameters given in table a 1 at the reach scale the ten predictive equations systematically underestimate reaeration rate coefficients by a factor comprised between 1 2 and 4 fig 5 reaeration rate coefficients were also calculated for each sub reach using the local hydraulic parameters the mean and standard deviation of the ten predicted k2 values obtained with the ten equations of table 2 are given in table 5 on average predictive equations strongly underestimate gas exchanges in the cascade sub reaches while they are consistent in low turbulent zones the spread of the k2 values given by the different equations indicated by their standard deviation is also significantly higher in cascades than in low turbulent zones elevated differences between predicted and measured k2 values in cascades are due to the fact that physically predictive equations are non reliable in high turbulent zones section 2 5 they are based on parameters that are highly difficult to measure in cascades such as the stream depth the underestimation of predicted reaeration rate coefficients in cascades significantly biases the predictions at the full reach scale leading to a systematic underestimation of global gas exchanges 3 3 impacts on reactive gases with a mean concentration of around 290 µmol l 1 stream a is oversaturated in co2 in the sense that it contains 10 times more co2 than it would at equilibrium with the atmosphere fig 6 co2 oversaturation is frequent in headwater streams because of inputs of groundwater that are highly concentrated in co2 due to the aerobic degradation of organic matter cole et al 2007 water rock interaction can also be a source of co2 in streams especially in karst regions chen et al 2004 the large excess of co2 in stream a originates from a small spring that flows 20 m upstream from the injection site the spring water has a co2 concentration reaching 650 µmol l 1 which is 30 times higher than the atmospheric equilibrium contrariwise stream a shows an undersaturation in o2 fig 6 its o2 concentration is comprised between 280 and 300 µmol l 1 while at equilibrium with the atmosphere it would be 344 µmol l 1 undersaturation in o2 is common in headwater streams because they are mostly net heterotrophs knapp et al 2015 riley and dodds 2012 young and huryn 1999 in cascades the state of the stream is rapidly modified by strong exchanges of gas following partial pressure gradients co2 oversaturation induces significant drops in co2 in cascades while o2 undersaturation induces gains in o2 fig 6 release of co2 to the atmosphere as well as stream oxygenation mainly occurs in the cascades note that the rain event that occurred when the pump was at 9 m from the injection site increased gas exchanges leading to a drop in co2 concentration and an increase in o2 concentration based on the mean co2 concentration of stream a and the gas exchange rate coefficient measured with helium and converted to co2 eq 4 we estimated the global co2 evasion rate of stream a at 47 µmol m 2 s 1 eq 6 this corresponds to 48 gc m 2 d 1 which is close to the evasion rate of 56 gc m 2 d 1 that was measured in a canadian steep headwater stream by direct co2 injections mcdowell and johnson 2018 the co2 evasion rate of stream a was also calculated using the gas exchange rate coefficients predicted by the empirical equations of table 2 it yielded systematically lower co2 evasion rates comprised between 16 and 44 gc m 2 d 1 table 6 thus the underestimation of gas exchange rate coefficients by empirical equations section 3 2 leads to a significant underestimation of the co2 flux from headwater streams if co2 concentrations in the stream were modified solely by gas exchanges with the atmosphere the calculated evasion rate of 48 gc m 2 d 1 would imply a decrease of 50 µmol l 1 in the co2 concentration between the upstream and the downstream end of the reach a this is higher than the measured net loss of co2 close to 20 µmol l 1 fig 6 showing that other processes such as oxygenic respiration partly counterbalance the loss of co2 to the atmosphere it highlights that the co2 evasion rates cannot be derived directly from the changes in co2 concentration along the streams 4 discussion 4 1 predictions of gas exchanges comparison between measured and predicted k2 values demonstrates that the presence of a few cascades along a stream significantly biases global predictions of gas exchange leading to a systematic underestimation of reaeration rate coefficients this is consistent with the study of ulseth et al 2019 showing at stream scale that empirical models underestimate gas exchanges in high channel slope streams mcdowell and johnson 2018 also highlighted when studying a headwater stream that models underestimate gas exchange rate coefficients for high k values processes governing gas exchanges in cascades fundamentally differ from those in flowing sections section 2 5 in cascades air bubbles have a strong control over gas exchanges chanson 1995 chanson and toombes 2002 cirpka et al 1993 overlooking specific processes occurring in cascades leads to an underestimation of gas exchanges in headwater catchments where shallow streams often display natural cascades increasing the reliability of predictions would require separate consideration of low turbulent zones and cascades for low turbulent stream sections our study confirms the predictive capacities of the empirical and semi empirical equations of table 2 for cascades predictions are more challenging and require additional morphological characterization or field experiments studies focused on spillways in flumes baylar et al 2006 essery et al 1978 gameson 1957 gulliver et al 1998 khdhiri et al 2014 tebbutt 1972 toombes and chanson 2005 and on dams caplow et al 2004 gamlin et al 2001 or cascades cirpka et al 1993 in rivers use the aeration efficiency e instead of the gas exchange rate coefficient k aeration efficiency was defined by gameson 1957 and represents the total change in gas concentration occurring in the cascade normalized by the air water concentration gradient 7 e c down c up c eq c up where cup mol l 1 is the upstream concentration cdown mol l 1 is the downstream concentration and ceq mol l 1 is the dissolved gas concentration at equilibrium with the atmosphere equations derived from lab experiments predict aeration efficiency as a function of cascade total height and if applicable of additional morphological parameters of the cascade such as the height of intermediate steps or the angle of the weir baylar and bagatur 2006 baylar et al 2006 baylar et al 2011 essery et al 1978 khdhiri et al 2014 the morphological characteristics of the hydraulic structure seem to be more reliable to predict aeration in cascades than the depth of the water layer however if these morphological characteristics are well defined in flumes they are much harder to describe properly in natural streams where cascades are made up of heterogeneous stones and pieces of wood for more accurate gas exchange quantification direct measurements remain necessary in cascades 4 2 impact of cascades on groundwater discharge estimates groundwater discharge in streams is commonly quantified using the natural gas tracer 222rn some authors like gilfedder et al 2019 and cartwright et al 2014 raised the question of the impact of the variability of turbulence on 222rn degassing rate and thus on groundwater discharge estimation our study points out that cascades by generating a fast equilibration between the stream and the atmosphere erase an important part of the gaseous groundwater signal in the stream e g rn he ar co2 ch4 n2 n2o a cascade that is a few tens of centimeters high can lose as much gas as a hundred meter long stream since such cascades are very common in low order streams this is prone to yield an underestimation of the groundwater discharge calculated by 222rn mass balances the location of the cascades should be taken into account when defining the 222rn sampling strategy and their number and size between the up and down 222rn sampling locations should be minimized our results suggest that in reaches without notable cascades one can reasonably calculate the 222rn degassing rate with empirical equations in reaches displaying notable cascades however direct gas tracer experiments appear to be necessary 4 3 hot spots of reaeration studies based on flume experiments recommend the use of dams in rivers subject to eutrophication to enhance water reaeration tebbutt 1972 our study shows that natural cascades significantly increase the oxygenation of headwater streams in this way they might strongly help sustaining aerobic metabolism and thus provide a crucial ecosystem service in headwater catchment subject to eutrophication dodds and smith 2016 garnier and billen 2007 considered as reaeration hot spots small cascades have the potential to enhance measurably the ecological conditions of eutrophic streams and might thus be considered in management and restoration strategies palmer et al 2005 4 4 hot spots of co2 emission most headwater streams are net sources of atmospheric co2 cole et al 2007 marx et al 2017 indeed organic matter respiration occurring in the contributing compartments aquifer hyporheic zone soil and in the stream network itself is often responsible for an oversaturation in co2 cole et al 2007 compared to the equilibrium with the atmosphere drops in co2 partial pressure in water after cascades and highly turbulent zones have been evidenced in headwater streams duvert et al 2018 leibowitz et al 2017 natchimuthu et al 2017 in karst systems these drops have been linked to water softening chen et al 2004 at a much bigger scale liu et al 2017 showed that co2 outgassing from low gradient large rivers was strongly controlled by the geomorphology here by simultaneously mapping the loss of a gas tracer and the changes in co2 concentration along a headwater stream we establish a direct link between streambed morphology gas exchanges and co2 release to the atmosphere we show that cascades significantly enhance gas exchanges leading to a fast co2 release to the atmosphere in a study focused on the temporal variability of gas exchanges mcdowell and johnson 2018 showed that 84 of co2 emissions from a steep headwater stream occurred when discharge was higher than the median they suggested that high flow events because they increase turbulence can be seen as hot moments of co2 emission in headwater streams mcclain et al 2003 here we highlight the spatial variability of co2 emissions and show that similarly by increasing gas exchanges cascades can be viewed as hot spots of co2 emission in headwater streams if we assume that the 19 km long first order stream network of our 35 km2 catchment has the same co2 emission rate as the studied stream a a rough estimate of the total evasion of co2 over all first order streams of the catchment can be calculated we limit the upscaling to the first order stream network of a small catchment in which we assume that on average cascades have the frequency and the size of those of stream a predictive equations from table 2 would lead to a total co2 emission comprised between 150 and 300 tc year 1 with the mean of the outputs from the ten equations being 220 tc year 1 while the measured gas exchange rate leads to a co2 emission of 330 tc year 1 such a rough first order estimation indicates that the prediction of gas exchange rate coefficients at a large scale with empirical equations is likely to induce a general underestimation of co2 emission from headwater catchments similarly empirical equations probably lead to an underestimation of the emission of other greenhouse gases such as ch4 5 conclusion using continuous helium injection we mapped gas exchanges along two low slope headwater streams in a temperate catchment in brittany france our experimental set up took advantage of the real time data visualization allowed by the in situ cf mims it highlights the new opportunities offered by this technology in terms of spatial as well as temporal characterization of gas exchange processes the semi continuous measurements allow to visualize and to quantify the uncertainties we evidenced a high spatial variability of gas exchanges related to the small scale heterogeneity of the streambed morphology which is a characteristic feature of headwater streams during one of our tracer tests a small cascade was responsible for almost half of the helium loss while it occupied less than 4 of the total stream length nevertheless the equations predicting the gas exchange rate coefficients in headwater streams do not account for the specific processes governing gas exchanges in natural cascades as a result while empirical relationships perform well in low turbulent zones they systematically underestimate gas exchange rate coefficients as soon as small cascades are present this highlights the necessity of performing direct measurements of gas exchange rate coefficients in reaches displaying cascades while low turbulent zones can be efficiently characterized by empirical equations additional co2 and o2 measurements highlighted that small cascades strongly modify the chemical state of headwater streams high gas exchange rate coefficients allow a fast incorporation of o2 in the water and a fast release of co2 to the atmosphere thus cascades sustain respiration by rebalancing o2 concentrations in the stream at the same time they promote the evasion of the oversaturated co2 to the atmosphere finally small natural cascades are hot spots for both stream oxygenation and greenhouse gas emission rough calculations of co2 emissions showed that the use of empirical equations leads to an underestimation of global co2 emissions from headwater streams since the small scale morphological heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of headwater streams the upscaling effort could be helped by a distinct consideration of cascades and low turbulent sections the first step would be to separately characterize gas exchange processes in these totally different hydrodynamic regimes the second step would be to estimate the proportion of these two regimes in the stream network this could be helped by innovative technologies such as lidar allowing a fine scale characterization of the

5904,optimally using multi source remote sensing rs and or reanalyzed hydrological products requires knowledge of each product s accuracy and inter product error cross correlations quadruple collocation qc analysis can potentially solve for this error information without the reliance of high quality ground references however qc requires at least three independent products for a variable of interest at the global scale obtaining three independent products is often a challenge to address this issue this study proposes an extended double instrumental variable algorithm denoted as eivd which can accurately estimate product error and inter product error cross correlations using only two independent products a requirement easier to meet in practice synthetic numerical experiments demonstrate that eivd is robust and unbiased provided product error auto correlations are not strongly contrasting the performance of eivd is further tested via a real data global precipitation error analysis using traditional qc results as a validation reference the global consistency i e spatial correlation of qc and eivd estimated product truth correlation is above 0 86 for all precipitation products being considered and the relative mean difference of qc and eivd based correlations is on average less than 5 the spatial consistency of qc and eivd based inter product error cross correlation is 0 47 with a relative bias of 8 a quantitative analysis demonstrates that regions with inconsistent eivd and qc results are likely attributable to the violation of the qc error independency assumptions given the robustness of eivd in fully parameterizing hydrological product error information it is expected to improve the accuracy and efficiency of multi source hydrological data merging and data assimilation keywords hydrological remote sensing error estimation cross correlated errors instrumental variable 1 introduction global hydrological products derived by remote sensing rs reanalysis and land surface modeling systems are increasingly available e g huffman et al 2007 entekhabi et al 2010 dee et al 2011 gelaro et al 2017 however these global products contain retrieval modeling errors as a result hydrological estimates derived from different products are not entirely consistent sun et al 2018 chen et al 2018 statistically the merging of multi source hydrological data may suppress product uncertainty and benefit global hydrology and climate analysis dong and crow 2018 yilmaz et al 2012 beck et al 2017 optimally merging independent hydrological products is relatively straightforward for instance triple collocation analysis can be used to solve for the error variance of each product on a grid cell by grid cell basis over the entire globe stoffelen 1998 once these error variances are estimated products can be optimally merged using least square yilmaz et al 2012 gruber et al 2017 and or data assimilation techniques dong and crow 2018 unfortunately in practice the mutual independence assumption is likely violated for most geophysical products for example land surface models utilize similar model structures and meteorological parameter datasets which are expected to contain cross correlated errors crow et al 2015 likewise rs products commonly use similar retrieval models and auxiliary data and hence cannot be considered as completely independent dong et al 2019 chen et al 2018 massari et al 2017 neglecting such cross correlated errors will theoretically bias the optimal merging techniques and lead to sub optimal results gruber et al 2016 proposed a quadruple collocation qc analysis which can solve for the inter product error cross correlations provided three independent products of a geophysical variable are available qc can estimate the absolute and the cross correlated errors of all the input products by solving a set of linear equations however as discussed above different rs and model based products are likely to contain cross correlated errors hence simultaneously obtaining three wholly independent hydrological products for qc analysis is often challenging dong et al 2019 with this limitation in mind su et al 2014 suggested that the lagged time series of a product can be considered as an instrumental variable and used in lieu as a third independent product this single instrumental variable ivs approach can replicate triple collocation analysis with only two instead of three independent products this finding is significant since acquiring two independent products for a hydrological variable of interest is usually straightforward however such analysis is sensitive to both sampling and the potential presence of auto correlated errors dong et al 2019 enhanced the ivs method by including a second instrumental variable double instrumental variable or ivd which is more robust to random sampling and auto correlated errors following dong et al 2019 this study presents an extended double instrumental variable technique denoted as eivd to robustly estimate the inter product error cross correlations with only two independent products since eivd is an extension of ivd it can also estimate the absolute error of the products being considered therefore eivd provides more comprehensive error information for optimally using merging hydrological products collected from different sources we begin by numerically testing the eivd performances using well controlled synthetic experiments given that statistical precipitation error analysis has been verified using high density gauge observations li et al 2018 massari et al 2017 qc estimated global precipitation errors are used as a reference for evaluating eivd performances in a real world demonstration 2 materials and methods 2 1 quadruple collocation analysis as mentioned above a global precipitation error analysis was used as a real data demonstration hence a multiplicative error model was applied tian et al 2013 in the multiplicative error model a precipitation time series estimated by product x is related to the truth p as 1 x b x p β x e x where b x and β x are temporal constants and x is random noise alemohammad et al 2015 after log transformation eq 1 is reduced to a linear error model 2 x β x p b x x where x log x and p log p with analogous equations for product y z and w in qc all the errors are assumed orthogonal to the truth i e x p y p z p w p 0 and mutually independent except for w and z i e z w 0 and x y x z x w y z y w 0 under these assumptions the variances of the truth and the errors can be estimated in a linear system 3 a β x 2 c pp β y 2 c pp β z 2 c pp β w 2 c pp β z β w c pp c x x c y y c z z c w w c z w a 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

xx c yy c zz c ww c xy c xz c yz c xy c yz c xz c yz c xz c xy c xy c xw c yw c xy c yw c xw c xw c yw c xy c xz c zw c xy c xw c yz c xy where c represents the covariance of subscript variables the least square solution for qc is given as 4 a a t a 1 a t b based on eq 4 all the error terms both product error variances and inter product error covariances are simultaneously solved for in the vector of a in addition to the absolute error solved in eq 3 product truth correlation is another commonly applied error metrics for evaluating the performance of a hydrological product 5 r x qc β x 2 c pp β x 2 c pp c x x where r x qc is the qc estimated pearson correlation coefficient of x and the unknown truth likewise r y qc r z qc and r w qc can be estimated using analogous equations additionally the error cross correlation of z and w can be solved for as 6 ec zw qc c z w c z z c w w where ec zw qc is the qc estimated error cross correlation of product z and w 2 2 instrumental variable based algorithms 2 2 1 double instrumental variable algorithm instrumental variable based approach typically uses a temporally lag 1 day time series of one product e g x t 1 α x p t 1 b x x t 1 as the third independent product in a triple collocation analysis su et al 2014 dong et al 2019 demonstrated that a more robust solution can be achieved by using two instrumental variables i e employing lag time series from both products denoted as double instrumental variable algorithm or ivd provided the two independent products e g x and z contain serially white errors i e x t x t 1 z t z t 1 0 the dynamic range ratio of x and z can be estimated as 7 s β x β z l xx l zz where l xx and l zz are the auto covariance of x and z respectively e g l xx x t x t 1 the variance of x and the product truth correlation of x i e r x ivd can be solved for as 8 c x x c xx c xy s 9 r x ivd c xy c xx s the error characteristics of z can be estimated using analogous equations as demonstrated in dong et al 2019 in the presence of auto correlated errors the dynamic range ratio s has to be modified as 10 s aut s 1 2 α x α z l x 1 2 α x α z α x 2 α z 2 l z where s aut is the ivd estimated s in the presence of auto correlated errors l x and l z are the error auto covariances of x and z respectively the second and the third terms of the right hand side of eq 10 are the biases due to auto correlated observation errors clearly the auto correlated error impacts partly offset each other provided l x and l z have the same sign in particular ivd is unbiased if l x α x 2 α z 2 l z however ivd may contain relatively large biases when l x and α x 2 α z 2 l z are strongly contrasting 2 2 2 extended double instrumental variable algorithm as with the qc analysis a linear system that solves for inter product error cross correlation based on ivd algorithm can be constructed as 11 a β x 2 c pp β z 2 c pp β w 2 c pp β z β w c pp c x x c z z c w w c z w a 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 b c xx c zz c ww c zw c xz l xx l zz c xw l xx l ww c xz l zz l xx c xw l ww l xx c xw l yy l xx c xz l ww l xx likewise a can be estimated using eq 4 which contains the variance of both true signals and product errors the product truth correlations and inter product error cross correlations are subsequently solved for using eqs 5 and 6 consistent with ivd all the errors are assumed to be temporally white orthogonal to the truth and mutually independent except for w and z comparing eqs 3 and 11 demonstrates that eivd reproduces qc solutions without requiring the availability of y an independent product 2 3 precipitation data as noted above the performances of eivd were evaluated using precipitation error analyses which requires at least three independent precipitation products for qc and two independent products for eivd following previous studies massari et al 2017 dong et al 2019 ground based reanalyzed and rs retrieved precipitation products were assumed to have independent errors and used for eivd and qc analysis this assumption was also revisited in the results section the first global daily precipitation product is provided by the climate prediction center cpc xie et al 2007 the cpc product is constructed by statistically interpolating gauge precipitation data onto a 0 5 degree spatial grid the 0 5 degree daily reanalyzed era interim precipitation product dee et al 2011 was collected from european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the era precipitation product is generated using the ecmwf forecast model cy31r2 the l3 trmm 3b42rt daily v7 precipitation product is provided by the tropical rainfall measuring mission huffman et al 1997 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degree this daily trmm product is generated by taking the daily average of the near real time 3 hourly trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42rt product and without ingesting any ground based precipitation data a second 0 25 degree daily rs based precipitation product was collected from the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks for climate data record persiann cdr denoted as per ashouri et al 2015 in per precipitation is estimated using rs infrared data and an artificial neural network to be consistent with cpc and era interim denoted as era data all the precipitation products were linearly averaged onto 0 5 degree spatial grids and only data collected from 2007 to 2015 were used for demonstration as shown in eq 2 all the precipitation products were log transformed prior to qc and eivd analysis which requires the removal of no rain days based on a rain no rain threshold similar to li et al 2018 days with cumulative precipitation below a threshold value of 0 01 m 3 m 3 were assigned to this threshold value before the application of the log transformation 2 4 synthetic experiments to start well controlled synthetic experiments were used to investigate the performance of qc and eivd under different error assumptions the first set of synthetic experiment was to test the performances of qc and eivd in an ideal environment where all error assumptions are satisfied a synthetic true time series was generated using a log transformed cpc precipitation time series at a random grid cell then four synthetic products i e x y z and w were generated by adding serially white random errors to this synthetic truth using eq 2 the variance of the synthetic errors was determined by a prescribed signal to noise ratio which was randomly sampled from 0 5 1 for simplicity all the β values in eq 2 were assumed to be one note that this assumption has no impacts on our results as with the qc assumptions only z and w were assumed to contain cross correlated errors with error cross correlation varying from 0 1 to 0 9 all the four products i e x y z and w were used in qc analysis and only x z w were used in eivd the above experiment was replicated 1000 times to provide a robust comparison of qc and eivd in the second set of experiments we investigated the accuracy of eivd for the case where errors in the synthetic products are auto correlated to do so we repeated the first experiment but with errors generated from a first order auto regressive process with auto correlation coefficient values randomly sampled from the interval 0 0 5 this represents the case that all the input products contain relatively low auto correlated errors likewise we also tested the cases that all products contain highly auto correlated errors where error auto correlations were randomly sampled from the larger interval 0 5 1 the third experiment tested eivd using synthetic products with contrasting error auto correlations this was done by repeating the first experiment but assuming product x and only product x contains auto correlated errors the error auto correlation of x was randomly sampled from 0 5 1 and as with the first experiment errors in both other synthetic products were assumed serially white i e error auto correlation is zero 2 5 real world demonstration in addition to numerical synthetic experiments ground based reanalyzed and rs i e trmm and per retrieved precipitation products shown in section 2 3 were used for demonstrating the performance of qc and eivd in the qc based analysis only per and trmm were assumed to contain cross correlated errors and their error cross correlation was calculated using cpc era per and trmm precipitation time series on a grid cell by grid cell basis over global land areas these qc results were then used as reference for evaluating a cpc trmm per based eivd analysis although era and trmm per are commonly assumed to have mutually independent errors massari et al 2017 dong et al 2019 cpc era trmm and cpc era per based eivd analyses were considered to estimate the era trmm and era per error cross correlations and examine this independence assumption in greater detail these results were also used to explain the differences between qc and eivd results at the global scale finally as shown in dong et al 2018 statistical error estimators are unstable when the data quality of the input products are low hence we only considered grids in which inter product correlation coefficient are greater than 0 1 3 results as shown in the method section both qc and eivd can solve for the absolute error variance e g c x x product truth correlation e g r x and error cross correlations however the absolute precipitation error variance of a grid cell tends to be proportional to its annual mean precipitation dong et al 2019 i e grid cells with larger annual mean precipitation tend to contain higher absolute error variances and vice versa hence this error metric has limited information in distinguishing the performances of different estimators consequently the estimated absolute error variance was not discussed in this study 3 1 synthetic test of eivd performances fig 1 shows the performances of qc and eivd under the assumption that all product errors are serially white and only two of the four products contain cross correlated errors under such error assumptions sampling uncertainty in r estimates provided by qc and eivd have zero means and narrow 5th 95th percentile ranges fig 1a likewise both qc and eivd can accurately estimate the true error cross correlations with very small uncertainty fig 1b and c these results suggest that both eivd and qc are robust and unbiased provided their assumptions are satisfied fig 2 further investigates the eivd performances when the zero auto correlation assumption in eivd is violated note that the presence of auto correlated error has no impact on qc and hence qc results are not presented provided all the products contain relatively small amount of auto correlated error fig 2a and d the uncertainty of eivd estimates is slightly increased compared to fig 1a and c however eivd remain unbiased for both r and error cross correlation estimates likewise eivd is robust and unbiased even when all three products contain highly auto correlated errors fig 2b and e however eivd can be significantly biased when its input products have contrasting error auto correlations fig 2c and f these numerical results are consistent with the analytical solutions shown in dong et al 2019 provided all products contain similar error auto correlations the impacts of auto correlated errors are canceled out in eivd irrespective of the absolute magnitude of the error auto correlation strength however ivd and by extension eivd is disproportionately affected by the presence of auto correlated errors and biased when the error auto correlation strengths of its input products are contrasting see eq 10 3 2 real world comparison of qc and eivd at the global scale qc results demonstrate that cpc has higher skills over regions with relative higher rain gauge density e g north america europe and china and lower skill in data sparse regions e g central africa fig 3 a interestingly per demonstrates its highest skill in the south america africa and india fig 3c similar global patterns of precipitation retrieval skill are also found for the trmm product fig 3e these findings are consistent with previous global precipitation error analyses shown in massari et al 2017 and dong et al 2019 relative to trmm retrievals per are generally superior in the western conus and the central asia eivd based spatial patterns of precipitation skill in these three products are highly analogous to qc results comparing the left and the right column of fig 3 the spatial consistency pearson correlation coefficient of qc and eivd derived r values is above 0 86 for all the three products the consistency of qc and eivd are further demonstrated in fig 4 a to c although the global mean differences of qc and eivd estimated r values are less than 5 regional differences between qc and eivd estimated r are still evident for example relative to qc eivd underestimates the skill of cpc over europe china and australia in contrast eivd based r values for per and trmm are higher than the qc estimates in these areas the error cross correlations of per and trmm are shown in fig 5 a and b as shown in qc results fig 5a the error of per and trmm are strongly correlated in north and south america and central africa with ec values up to 0 6 on the contrary the per and trmm precipitation errors are relatively less correlated in north africa and asia similar global per trmm error cross correlation patters are also demonstrated in eivd results fig 5b as with r results some regional differences between qc and eivd are noticeable in their error cross correlation estimates for instance qc based error cross correlation is lower than eivd over south america and central africa on the other hand relative to eivd qc is biased high in india china and australia hence while a general consistency between qc and eivd estimated error cross correlation is shown in fig 4d a global mean difference of 8 is also observed although era is assumed to be independent of both per and trmm in qc analysis eivd estimates show that the error of era is negatively correlated with both per and trmm in china india and australia fig 6 a and b this suggests that qc assumptions are likely violated over these regions mathematically negative era per and era trmm error cross correlations mean that qc tends to punish per and trmm and favor cpc when these products are simultaneously used in qc consequently qc based r is biased high for cpc and biased low for per and trmm for these regions this is consistent with the spatial distribution of qc eivd differences fig 3 likewise qc based error cross correlation estimates are also biased analogously fig 7 quantitatively confirms the analysis above here we binned pixel wise qc eivd differences shown in figs 3 and 5 according to the mean era per and era trmm error cross correlations denoted as mec fig 6c the irregular interval of the bins is required to ensure each bin has equal sample size support fig 7 demonstrates the clear linear relationship of qc eivd differences and mec for both r and error cross correlation estimates it is notable that qc and eivd differences are close to zero when mec is approximately zero a condition that ensures that qc assumptions are fully respected these findings suggest that the regional inconsistency of qc and eivd is attributable to the violation of qc assumptions i e the inter dependency of era and trmm and per errors 4 discussions and conclusions optimally merging multi source remote sensing rs and reanalyzed hydrological products requires information about the absolute skill and error cross correlations of various products quadruple collocation qc gruber et al 2016 can estimate this information within a linear system however it requires three independent products which is often challenging if not outright impossible for most geophysical variables here we propose an extended double instrument variable technique eivd that can simultaneously estimate absolute and cross correlated errors using only two independent products an easier requirement to meet in practice provided that temporally auto correlated errors of the products are similar in magnitude or and negligible eivd is unbiased and mathematically equivalent to qc these analytical findings are validated by well controlled synthetic experiments given

5904,optimally using multi source remote sensing rs and or reanalyzed hydrological products requires knowledge of each product s accuracy and inter product error cross correlations quadruple collocation qc analysis can potentially solve for this error information without the reliance of high quality ground references however qc requires at least three independent products for a variable of interest at the global scale obtaining three independent products is often a challenge to address this issue this study proposes an extended double instrumental variable algorithm denoted as eivd which can accurately estimate product error and inter product error cross correlations using only two independent products a requirement easier to meet in practice synthetic numerical experiments demonstrate that eivd is robust and unbiased provided product error auto correlations are not strongly contrasting the performance of eivd is further tested via a real data global precipitation error analysis using traditional qc results as a validation reference the global consistency i e spatial correlation of qc and eivd estimated product truth correlation is above 0 86 for all precipitation products being considered and the relative mean difference of qc and eivd based correlations is on average less than 5 the spatial consistency of qc and eivd based inter product error cross correlation is 0 47 with a relative bias of 8 a quantitative analysis demonstrates that regions with inconsistent eivd and qc results are likely attributable to the violation of the qc error independency assumptions given the robustness of eivd in fully parameterizing hydrological product error information it is expected to improve the accuracy and efficiency of multi source hydrological data merging and data assimilation keywords hydrological remote sensing error estimation cross correlated errors instrumental variable 1 introduction global hydrological products derived by remote sensing rs reanalysis and land surface modeling systems are increasingly available e g huffman et al 2007 entekhabi et al 2010 dee et al 2011 gelaro et al 2017 however these global products contain retrieval modeling errors as a result hydrological estimates derived from different products are not entirely consistent sun et al 2018 chen et al 2018 statistically the merging of multi source hydrological data may suppress product uncertainty and benefit global hydrology and climate analysis dong and crow 2018 yilmaz et al 2012 beck et al 2017 optimally merging independent hydrological products is relatively straightforward for instance triple collocation analysis can be used to solve for the error variance of each product on a grid cell by grid cell basis over the entire globe stoffelen 1998 once these error variances are estimated products can be optimally merged using least square yilmaz et al 2012 gruber et al 2017 and or data assimilation techniques dong and crow 2018 unfortunately in practice the mutual independence assumption is likely violated for most geophysical products for example land surface models utilize similar model structures and meteorological parameter datasets which are expected to contain cross correlated errors crow et al 2015 likewise rs products commonly use similar retrieval models and auxiliary data and hence cannot be considered as completely independent dong et al 2019 chen et al 2018 massari et al 2017 neglecting such cross correlated errors will theoretically bias the optimal merging techniques and lead to sub optimal results gruber et al 2016 proposed a quadruple collocation qc analysis which can solve for the inter product error cross correlations provided three independent products of a geophysical variable are available qc can estimate the absolute and the cross correlated errors of all the input products by solving a set of linear equations however as discussed above different rs and model based products are likely to contain cross correlated errors hence simultaneously obtaining three wholly independent hydrological products for qc analysis is often challenging dong et al 2019 with this limitation in mind su et al 2014 suggested that the lagged time series of a product can be considered as an instrumental variable and used in lieu as a third independent product this single instrumental variable ivs approach can replicate triple collocation analysis with only two instead of three independent products this finding is significant since acquiring two independent products for a hydrological variable of interest is usually straightforward however such analysis is sensitive to both sampling and the potential presence of auto correlated errors dong et al 2019 enhanced the ivs method by including a second instrumental variable double instrumental variable or ivd which is more robust to random sampling and auto correlated errors following dong et al 2019 this study presents an extended double instrumental variable technique denoted as eivd to robustly estimate the inter product error cross correlations with only two independent products since eivd is an extension of ivd it can also estimate the absolute error of the products being considered therefore eivd provides more comprehensive error information for optimally using merging hydrological products collected from different sources we begin by numerically testing the eivd performances using well controlled synthetic experiments given that statistical precipitation error analysis has been verified using high density gauge observations li et al 2018 massari et al 2017 qc estimated global precipitation errors are used as a reference for evaluating eivd performances in a real world demonstration 2 materials and methods 2 1 quadruple collocation analysis as mentioned above a global precipitation error analysis was used as a real data demonstration hence a multiplicative error model was applied tian et al 2013 in the multiplicative error model a precipitation time series estimated by product x is related to the truth p as 1 x b x p β x e x where b x and β x are temporal constants and x is random noise alemohammad et al 2015 after log transformation eq 1 is reduced to a linear error model 2 x β x p b x x where x log x and p log p with analogous equations for product y z and w in qc all the errors are assumed orthogonal to the truth i e x p y p z p w p 0 and mutually independent except for w and z i e z w 0 and x y x z x w y z y w 0 under these assumptions the variances of the truth and the errors can be estimated in a linear system 3 a β x 2 c pp β y 2 c pp β z 2 c pp β w 2 c pp β z β w c pp c x x c y y c z z c w w c z w a 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

least square solution for qc is given as 4 a a t a 1 a t b based on eq 4 all the error terms both product error variances and inter product error covariances are simultaneously solved for in the vector of a in addition to the absolute error solved in eq 3 product truth correlation is another commonly applied error metrics for evaluating the performance of a hydrological product 5 r x qc β x 2 c pp β x 2 c pp c x x where r x qc is the qc estimated pearson correlation coefficient of x and the unknown truth likewise r y qc r z qc and r w qc can be estimated using analogous equations additionally the error cross correlation of z and w can be solved for as 6 ec zw qc c z w c z z c w w where ec zw qc is the qc estimated error cross correlation of product z and w 2 2 instrumental variable based algorithms 2 2 1 double instrumental variable algorithm instrumental variable based approach typically uses a temporally lag 1 day time series of one product e g x t 1 α x p t 1 b x x t 1 as the third independent product in a triple collocation analysis su et al 2014 dong et al 2019 demonstrated that a more robust solution can be achieved by using two instrumental variables i e employing lag time series from both products denoted as double instrumental variable algorithm or ivd provided the two independent products e g x and z contain serially white errors i e x t x t 1 z t z t 1 0 the dynamic range ratio of x and z can be estimated as 7 s β x β z l xx l zz where l xx and l zz are the auto covariance of x and z respectively e g l xx x t x t 1 the variance of x and the product truth correlation of x i e r x ivd can be solved for as 8 c x x c xx c xy s 9 r x ivd c xy c xx s the error characteristics of z can be estimated using analogous equations as demonstrated in dong et al 2019 in the presence of auto correlated errors the dynamic range ratio s has to be modified as 10 s aut s 1 2 α x α z l x 1 2 α x α z α x 2 α z 2 l z where s aut is the ivd estimated s in the presence of auto correlated errors l x and l z are the error auto covariances of x and z respectively the second and the third terms of the right hand side of eq 10 are the biases due to auto correlated observation errors clearly the auto correlated error impacts partly offset each other provided l x and l z have the same sign in particular ivd is unbiased if l x α x 2 α z 2 l z however ivd may contain relatively large biases when l x and α x 2 α z 2 l z are strongly contrasting 2 2 2 extended double instrumental variable algorithm as with the qc analysis a linear system that solves for inter product error cross correlation based on ivd algorithm can be constructed as 11 a β x 2 c pp β z 2 c pp β w 2 c pp β z β w c pp c x x c z z c w w c z w a 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 b c xx c zz c ww c zw c xz l xx l zz c xw l xx l ww c xz l zz l xx c xw l ww l xx c xw l yy l xx c xz l ww l xx likewise a can be estimated using eq 4 which contains the variance of both true signals and product errors the product truth correlations and inter product error cross correlations are subsequently solved for using eqs 5 and 6 consistent with ivd all the errors are assumed to be temporally white orthogonal to the truth and mutually independent except for w and z comparing eqs 3 and 11 demonstrates that eivd reproduces qc solutions without requiring the availability of y an independent product 2 3 precipitation data as noted above the performances of eivd were evaluated using precipitation error analyses which requires at least three independent precipitation products for qc and two independent products for eivd following previous studies massari et al 2017 dong et al 2019 ground based reanalyzed and rs retrieved precipitation products were assumed to have independent errors and used for eivd and qc analysis this assumption was also revisited in the results section the first global daily precipitation product is provided by the climate prediction center cpc xie et al 2007 the cpc product is constructed by statistically interpolating gauge precipitation data onto a 0 5 degree spatial grid the 0 5 degree daily reanalyzed era interim precipitation product dee et al 2011 was collected from european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the era precipitation product is generated using the ecmwf forecast model cy31r2 the l3 trmm 3b42rt daily v7 precipitation product is provided by the tropical rainfall measuring mission huffman et al 1997 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degree this daily trmm product is generated by taking the daily average of the near real time 3 hourly trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42rt product and without ingesting any ground based precipitation data a second 0 25 degree daily rs based precipitation product was collected from the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks for climate data record persiann cdr denoted as per ashouri et al 2015 in per precipitation is estimated using rs infrared data and an artificial neural network to be consistent with cpc and era interim denoted as era data all the precipitation products were linearly averaged onto 0 5 degree spatial grids and only data collected from 2007 to 2015 were used for demonstration as shown in eq 2 all the precipitation products were log transformed prior to qc and eivd analysis which requires the removal of no rain days based on a rain no rain threshold similar to li et al 2018 days with cumulative precipitation below a threshold value of 0 01 m 3 m 3 were assigned to this threshold value before the application of the log transformation 2 4 synthetic experiments to start well controlled synthetic experiments were used to investigate the performance of qc and eivd under different error assumptions the first set of synthetic experiment was to test the performances of qc and eivd in an ideal environment where all error assumptions are satisfied a synthetic true time series was generated using a log transformed cpc precipitation time series at a random grid cell then four synthetic products i e x y z and w were generated by adding serially white random errors to this synthetic truth using eq 2 the variance of the synthetic errors was determined by a prescribed signal to noise ratio which was randomly sampled from 0 5 1 for simplicity all the β values in eq 2 were assumed to be one note that this assumption has no impacts on our results as with the qc assumptions only z and w were assumed to contain cross correlated errors with error cross correlation varying from 0 1 to 0 9 all the four products i e x y z and w were used in qc analysis and only x z w were used in eivd the above experiment was replicated 1000 times to provide a robust comparison of qc and eivd in the second set of experiments we investigated the accuracy of eivd for the case where errors in the synthetic products are auto correlated to do so we repeated the first experiment but with errors generated from a first order auto regressive process with auto correlation coefficient values randomly sampled from the interval 0 0 5 this represents the case that all the input products contain relatively low auto correlated errors likewise we also tested the cases that all products contain highly auto correlated errors where error auto correlations were randomly sampled from the larger interval 0 5 1 the third experiment tested eivd using synthetic products with contrasting error auto correlations this was done by repeating the first experiment but assuming product x and only product x contains auto correlated errors the error auto correlation of x was randomly sampled from 0 5 1 and as with the first experiment errors in both other synthetic products were assumed serially white i e error auto correlation is zero 2 5 real world demonstration in addition to numerical synthetic experiments ground based reanalyzed and rs i e trmm and per retrieved precipitation products shown in section 2 3 were used for demonstrating the performance of qc and eivd in the qc based analysis only per and trmm were assumed to contain cross correlated errors and their error cross correlation was calculated using cpc era per and trmm precipitation time series on a grid cell by grid cell basis over global land areas these qc results were then used as reference for evaluating a cpc trmm per based eivd analysis although era and trmm per are commonly assumed to have mutually independent errors massari et al 2017 dong et al 2019 cpc era trmm and cpc era per based eivd analyses were considered to estimate the era trmm and era per error cross correlations and examine this independence assumption in greater detail these results were also used to explain the differences between qc and eivd results at the global scale finally as shown in dong et al 2018 statistical error estimators are unstable when the data quality of the input products are low hence we only considered grids in which inter product correlation coefficient are greater than 0 1 3 results as shown in the method section both qc and eivd can solve for the absolute error variance e g c x x product truth correlation e g r x and error cross correlations however the absolute precipitation error variance of a grid cell tends to be proportional to its annual mean precipitation dong et al 2019 i e grid cells with larger annual mean precipitation tend to contain higher absolute error variances and vice versa hence this error metric has limited information in distinguishing the performances of different estimators consequently the estimated absolute error variance was not discussed in this study 3 1 synthetic test of eivd performances fig 1 shows the performances of qc and eivd under the assumption that all product errors are serially white and only two of the four products contain cross correlated errors under such error assumptions sampling uncertainty in r estimates provided by qc and eivd have zero means and narrow 5th 95th percentile ranges fig 1a likewise both qc and eivd can accurately estimate the true error cross correlations with very small uncertainty fig 1b and c these results suggest that both eivd and qc are robust and unbiased provided their assumptions are satisfied fig 2 further investigates the eivd performances when the zero auto correlation assumption in eivd is violated note that the presence of auto correlated error has no impact on qc and hence qc results are not presented provided all the products contain relatively small amount of auto correlated error fig 2a and d the uncertainty of eivd estimates is slightly increased compared to fig 1a and c however eivd remain unbiased for both r and error cross correlation estimates likewise eivd is robust and unbiased even when all three products contain highly auto correlated errors fig 2b and e however eivd can be significantly biased when its input products have contrasting error auto correlations fig 2c and f these numerical results are consistent with the analytical solutions shown in dong et al 2019 provided all products contain similar error auto correlations the impacts of auto correlated errors are canceled out in eivd irrespective of the absolute magnitude of the error auto correlation strength however ivd and by extension eivd is disproportionately affected by the presence of auto correlated errors and biased when the error auto correlation strengths of its input products are contrasting see eq 10 3 2 real world comparison of qc and eivd at the global scale qc results demonstrate that cpc has higher skills over regions with relative higher rain gauge density e g north america europe and china and lower skill in data sparse regions e g central africa fig 3 a interestingly per demonstrates its highest skill in the south america africa and india fig 3c similar global patterns of precipitation retrieval skill are also found for the trmm product fig 3e these findings are consistent with previous global precipitation error analyses shown in massari et al 2017 and dong et al 2019 relative to trmm retrievals per are generally superior in the western conus and the central asia eivd based spatial patterns of precipitation skill in these three products are highly analogous to qc results comparing the left and the right column of fig 3 the spatial consistency pearson correlation coefficient of qc and eivd derived r values is above 0 86 for all the three products the consistency of qc and eivd are further demonstrated in fig 4 a to c although the global mean differences of qc and eivd estimated r values are less than 5 regional differences between qc and eivd estimated r are still evident for example relative to qc eivd underestimates the skill of cpc over europe china and australia in contrast eivd based r values for per and trmm are higher than the qc estimates in these areas the error cross correlations of per and trmm are shown in fig 5 a and b as shown in qc results fig 5a the error of per and trmm are strongly correlated in north and south america and central africa with ec values up to 0 6 on the contrary the per and trmm precipitation errors are relatively less correlated in north africa and asia similar global per trmm error cross correlation patters are also demonstrated in eivd results fig 5b as with r results some regional differences between qc and eivd are noticeable in their error cross correlation estimates for instance qc based error cross correlation is lower than eivd over south america and central africa on the other hand relative to eivd qc is biased high in india china and australia hence while a general consistency between qc and eivd estimated error cross correlation is shown in fig 4d a global mean difference of 8 is also observed although era is assumed to be independent of both per and trmm in qc analysis eivd estimates show that the error of era is negatively correlated with both per and trmm in china india and australia fig 6 a and b this suggests that qc assumptions are likely violated over these regions mathematically negative era per and era trmm error cross correlations mean that qc tends to punish per and trmm and favor cpc when these products are simultaneously used in qc consequently qc based r is biased high for cpc and biased low for per and trmm for these regions this is consistent with the spatial distribution of qc eivd differences fig 3 likewise qc based error cross correlation estimates are also biased analogously fig 7 quantitatively confirms the analysis above here we binned pixel wise qc eivd differences shown in figs 3 and 5 according to the mean era per and era trmm error cross correlations denoted as mec fig 6c the irregular interval of the bins is required to ensure each bin has equal sample size support fig 7 demonstrates the clear linear relationship of qc eivd differences and mec for both r and error cross correlation estimates it is notable that qc and eivd differences are close to zero when mec is approximately zero a condition that ensures that qc assumptions are fully respected these findings suggest that the regional inconsistency of qc and eivd is attributable to the violation of qc assumptions i e the inter dependency of era and trmm and per errors 4 discussions and conclusions optimally merging multi source remote sensing rs and reanalyzed hydrological products requires information about the absolute skill and error cross correlations of various products quadruple collocation qc gruber et al 2016 can estimate this information within a linear system however it requires three independent products which is often challenging if not outright impossible for most geophysical variables here we propose an extended double instrument variable technique eivd that can simultaneously estimate absolute and cross correlated errors using only two independent products an easier requirement to meet in practice provided that temporally auto correlated errors of the products are similar in magnitude or and negligible eivd is unbiased and mathematically equivalent to qc these analytical findings are validated by well controlled synthetic experiments given statistical error analysis has been verified for precipitation error estimation using high density precipitation networks massari et al 2017 li et al 2018 global qc based precipitation error analyses were used as a reference for evaluating the performance of eivd our results demonstrate a strong linear consistency between eivd and qc however some regional differences between eivd and qc values
