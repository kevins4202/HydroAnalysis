10105,comprehensive information on the past trend of local level water usage of the cultivated crops is important for agricultural planning and forecasting water needs this vital information is however deficient for the north west nw region of bangladesh we estimated actual crop evapotranspiration et total and crop usable effective rainfalls ter and er respectively and irrigation requirement ir of 8 major crops and 8 cropping patterns over historical period 1985 2015 by using swbcropwat model and trends of these water parameters by using makesens tool for the 16 districts of the region et of the rabi crops and cropping patterns revealed significant p 0 05 decreasing trends in all districts the average decrease being 13 31 in different districts er decreased significantly for most dry season crops in 4 districts ter was often greater than er for kharif crops which could not fully utilize ter always because of its non uniform temporal distributions ir showed significantly decreasing trend for the rabi crops in 11 districts and increasing trend for the kharif crops in 5 districts although et and ir decreased in most cases their total volumetric quantities showed significantly increasing trends due to expanded irrigated area in 16 districts over time ir increased by 27 186 in different districts because of water scarcity and prospective economic benefit farmers have been spontaneously adjusting crop selection shifting from higher water demanding crops to lower water demanding crop cultivation during the last two decades our information would guide planning the agriculture of the nw region by selecting appropriate crops based on sustainable limit of groundwater resources the employed methodology can evaluate crop suitability periodically for adjustment in any area keywords intensive irrigation crop suitability crop planning sustainability 1 introduction global water consumption has been increasing rapidly over the recent years because of accelerated economic and social developments irrigated agriculture being the largest water consuming sector is currently consuming 70 of the total water usage boretti and rosa 2019 and facing competing demands from other sectors like industrial and domestic sectors this reality along with climate change is leading to an inevitable water crisis guo and shen 2016 in many regions of the world agricultural production is already being adversely affected fao 2016 and will be affected in the future zhang et al 2013 by rising temperature changing precipitation patterns incidence of extreme events e g floods and droughts rising sea level and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide content in the ganges and brahmaputra basins increasing trend in temperature ipcc 2007 and rainfall particularly in wet season has been predicted moors et al 2011 mulligan et al 2011 jeuland et al 2013 masood et al 2015 climate change will directly affect crop evapotranspiration with a consequent increase in irrigation water demand kundzewicz et al 2007 rehana and mujumdar 2013 shen et al 2013 wang 2010 with a predicted global average increase of 7 21 by 2080s depending on climate change scenarios wada et al 2013 and perhaps by more than 40 across europe the united states of america and parts of asia ipcc 2014 seasonal irrigation demand has been predicted to increase by 13 23 de silva et al 2007 and 15 20 diaz et al 2007 by 2050 of the contrasting results zhang and cai 2013 estimated slightly decline in irrigation water requirements at the global scale despite the projected warmer climate elliott et al 2014 reported slightly increasing trend in global irrigation requirements taking into account the effect of co2 but likely decreasing trend without considering the effects of co2 water resources will likely decrease in many mid latitude and dry subtropical regions and increase at high latitudes and in many humid mid latitude regions ipcc 2014 climate variability and change influence groundwater systems taylor et al 2013 recharge to groundwater may decline in the future due to less number of short duration high intensity rainfall events kumar 2012 shah 2009 the reduced recharge may cause falling of groundwater levels in some regions such as the barind tract fig 1 of the north west nw bangladesh kirby et al 2013 mojid et al 2019 the decrease of surface water and groundwater resources in dry subtropical regions will intensify competition for water by different users with negative impact on regional water energy ecosystem services environmental health food security and agricultural productivity li et al 2010 ipcc 2014 hong et al 2016 mo et al 2017 the rivers in the southern himalayas support huge scale crop cultivation during november to march april a reduction in dry season flows due to climate change would have grim adverse impact on the lives of over a billion people in asia un world water assessment programme 2009 thus the cited studies share a common conclusion that climate change will very likely affect agriculture deleteriously thereby threatening global food security ipcc 2013 2014 therefore application of water and its managed usage have become a crucial issue in raising agricultural productivity and ensuring food security with limited water resources irrigated crop production remains essential to sustainable agricultural development and food security in many countries for example in bangladesh rice constitutes 93 4 of the total cereal production bbs 2017 and approximately 86 of the total water usage is attributed to the agricultural sector of which 70 is used to rice cultivation alone chowdhury 2010 the projected population in the country 185 million in 2030 and 202 million in 2050 united nations 2017 will require a further 12 4 and 21 0 million tons of rice by the year 2030 and 2050 respectively mainuddin and kirby 2015 a typical example of an intensive agricultural and irrigated area is the nw region of bangladesh where 78 of the total irrigated area is covered with groundwater hasanuzzaman et al 2017 mainuddin et al 2019 due to limited availability of surface water bbs 2017 consequently in some areas the groundwater levels have been declining continuously ahmad et al 2014 salem et al 2017 mojid et al 2019 also the impacts of climate change are evident in the region in the forms of variations in temperature inconsistent rainfall patterns shortened rainy season intense rainfall events and increased number of droughts mojid 2020 with adverse effects on crop production acharjee et al 2017a agriculture will continue ingesting more water in the next decades cawma 2007 and increased usage of groundwater compared to its current rate seems a most likely scenario the usages of water in domestic and industrial sectors are also rising with a predicted increase of 100 and 440 by 2030 and 2050 respectively bdp2100 2017 so there will be growing competition for getting water among the various water use sectors hanjra and qureshi 2010 consequently drought risk shahid and behrawan 2008 groundwater sustainability dey et al 2017 kirby et al 2015 peña arancibia et al 2020 and climate change impacts shamsudduha et al 2009 mainuddin et al 2015 kirby et al 2016 are considered the serious challenges for irrigation water availability and management estimating crop water demand is essential for forecasting irrigation and managing agricultural water hossain et al 2017 since demand management is regarded as an essential part of the overall solution of water scarcity shen et al 2013 the consequences of climate change are regionally specific mojid et al 2015 2016 and studies based on large spatial scales generally lack sufficient details required for local water management a clear understanding of variations in water requirement in response to the variations in local climate parameters is necessary in crop planning and water management to adapt to the changing climate field 2014 wang et al 2015 acharjee et al 2017b ahmad et al 2019 information on crop water requirements is also needed for selection of crops and cropping patterns and their irrigation scheduling knowledge on the amount of water demand is particularly crucial for decision making about the agricultural planning of the nw region of bangladesh understanding historical trends of water demand is also crucial to assess future water and food security khan et al 2017 kirby et al 2017 accurate quantification of crop water requirement and irrigation water demand by taking into account crop usable effective rainfall and analysis of their spatial and temporal variability are important to improve agricultural water management towards its sustainable usage there is a large body of literature on various aspects of water management e g hossain et al 2017 mainuddin et al 2020 drought e g ahmed 2006 shahid and behrawan 2008 bandudeltas 2015 hussain 2017 climate change e g shahid 2011 mojid et al 2015 mainuddin et al 2015 kirby et al

2020 for the nw region these studies mostly addressed their specific issue s for either a smaller area in the region or a single crop or only a few crops in particular areas of the region leading to only partial information we are not aware of any study that estimated crop water demand crop usable effective rainfall and irrigation requirement for all major crops and cropping patterns taking into account different soil types for all 16 districts of the region over long temporal scale therefore this study was planned to estimate these hydrologic parameters for the major crops and cropping patterns and trends of the hydrologic parameters for all 16 districts for the period from 1985 to 2015 and to compare their spatial and temporal variability also estimated in this study are the volumetric quantity of water demand for the crops and cropping patterns for all districts and the whole region along with their trends over the same time period soil water balance swb simulation model mainuddin et al 2015 can estimate actual crop evapotranspiration and irrigation requirement by utilizing the cropwat model of allen et al 1998 and the method of usda soil conservation service 1993 it provides identical results to the fao cropwat 8 0 model mainuddin et al 2020 under identical conditions the basic functions of the cropwat model include the calculation of reference evapotranspiration crop water requirements as well as crop and scheme irrigation it loops automatically through several climate regions soils crops and irrigation rules to avoid manually setting up and running many input files thus providing advantages over the cropwat model and hence was employed in this study mann kendall sens makesens statistics based on non parametric mann kendall tests is a well known method for determining trends and drift of time series data salmi 2002 this statistic is applicable for both monotonic and non monotonic trends and was adopted in this study to determine the trend of crop evapotranspiration effective rainfall and irrigation requirement and their volumetric quantities the estimated water demand based on cropping area will help understanding of the relationship between irrigation development and water usage and hence likely future water demand in the region hossain et al 2017 based on food demand and associated cropping area this will also provide information on whether or not the demand of groundwater will increase and exceed sustainable levels ahmad et al 2014 salem et al 2017 the historical trends of water demand can be utilized to identify the sustainable limit for groundwater use the information generated will ultimately help planning agriculture of the region by taking into account food demand and groundwater sustainability issues 2 methodology 2 1 main features of the nw region the north west nw region of bangladesh comprises rajshahi and rangpur divisions two of eight large administrative units of the country with each division is divided into eight administrative districts the districts are bogura chapainawabganj joypurhat naogaon natore pabna rajshahi and sirajganj in rajshahi division and thakurgaon rangpur panchagar nilphamari lalmonirhat kurigram gaibandha and dinajpur in rangpur division fig 1 the region is within 23 47 n to 25 50 n latitude and 88 01 e to 89 48 e longitude and situated on the west of the jamuna river name of the brahmaputra river in bangladesh and north of the padma river name of the ganges river in bangladesh it includes the barind tract which comprises most parts of the dinajpur rangpur pabna rajshahi bogura joypurhat and naogaon and some parts of nowabganj and gaibanda districts fig 1 the barind tract is mostly a drought prone water scarce area often causing distressing effects on agricultural production and livelihood of the people hussain 2017 the nw region has both a dry in winter and a humid in monsoon period the average annual rainfall over 1985 2010 varied from 1273 mm to 2515 mm of which 82 occurred during may to october monsoon and the remaining occurred during november to april dry season less than 6 rainfall occurs during the irrigation period january to april of boro rice shahid 2011 the lowest average annual rainfall 1428 mm was in the barind tract and the highest 2262 mm in the northern area mostly rangpur division rainfall varies widely from year to year coefficient of variation cv 20 24 average monthly temperature varies between 25 c and 35 c during the warmest period and between 9 c and 15 c during the coolest period banglapedia 2014 average monthly relative humidity ranges between 62 and 87 obtained correspondingly in march and july the mean annual relative humidity is 78 jahan et al 2010 the average annual reference evapotranspiration is 1309 mm which varies spatially and temporally cv 6 8 the highest reference evapotranspiration 1366 mm is observed in ishurdi in pabna district and the lowest 1251 mm in rangpur fig 1 forty four percent 44 of the reference evapotranspiration occurred during dry season and 56 during monsoon approximately 73 land area of the nw region is used for agriculture and the lands used for single double and triple cropping are 15 56 and 29 respectively in rajshahi division and 8 64 and 27 respectively in rangpur division bbs 2017 a large variety of different crops are grown in this region of which rice boro aus and aman wheat potato maize jute sugarcane mustard and vegetables are notable most of these crops except aman jute and sugarcane are cultivated during the dry period november april boro rice being the dominant dry period crop is cultivated on 70 of the cultivable area during december to may acharjee et al 2017a 2 2 data collection daily climatic data such as rainfall temperature wind speed sunshine duration solar radiation and relative humidity of the six available meteorological stations bogura rajshahi ishurdi rangpur dinajpur sayedpur fig 1 in the nw region for the period from 1985 to 2015 were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department these climate data for the other districts in the region were estimated by taking the same values of an adjacent district when most of its area was close to the districts whose climate data was to be estimated or taking average of the climate data of the adjacent districts it is noted that the total area of the nw region is 34 515 square kilometers and the six meteorological stations fairly represented weather data for the region so the estimated climate data also fairly represented climate data for the districts without having meteorological stations information on crops and cropping patterns for different districts were extracted from islam et al 2017 shirazy et al 2017 rashid et al 2017 and zaman et al 2017 the major soil types textural classes of the districts were collected from the soil resources development institute of bangladesh the hydraulic parameters of the soils such as water content at field capacity and saturation residual soil water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity were derived from available data base based on soil textural classes and given in supplementary table i data on the length of growth stage crop co efficient root depths depletion factors yield reduction factors planting sowing date crop growth duration harvesting date maximum ponding depth minimum ponding depth and refill ponding depth to be used in the swb model were collected from sub districts known as upazilas and district agriculture offices and given in supplementary table ii year wise areas under each crop in each district were also collected from these offices it is noted that before 2006 2007 the data on crop areas were based on the five earlier greater districts bogura dinajpur pabna rajshahi and rangpur such data for the current 16 districts are available only after that period so for our calculation the crop areas of the earlier years for the current 16 districts were backfilled by allocating areas of the earlier five districts to the current 16 districts in the same ratios as they occur in the later years in the 16 districts there are 316 cropping patterns throughout bangladesh excluding the very minor ones of which the five dominant ones are rice containing cropping patterns covering 51 of the net cropped area nca the most dominant cropping pattern is boro fallow t aman transplanted aman that covers 27 of nca nasim et al 2017 in terms of the crops and cropping patterns the whole nw region has been divided into four major agricultural regions nasim et al 2017 bogura region comprising bogura joypurhat pabna and sirajganj dinajpur region comprising dinajpur thakurgaon and panchagarh rajshahi region comprising rajshahi naogaon chapainawabganj and natore and rangpur region comprising rangpur gaibandha nilphamari lalmonirhat and kurigram total number of cropping patterns was 177 in bogura islam et al 2017 112 in dinajpur shirazy et al 2017 172 in rajshahi rashid et al 2017 and 134 in rangpur zaman et al 2017 agricultural region there are 3 cropping seasons in bangladesh known as kharif i march june kharif ii july october and rabi november february kharif i is pre monsoon period and characterized by unpredictable rainfall which fluctuates in timing regularity and intensity over the years during this period field soils become dry and wet sporadically kharif ii is monsoon period during which there remains enough soil moisture to support rainfed crops for most of this season rainfall exceeds potential evapotranspiration however most crops often face occasional drought and flood specifically in areas without provisions of irrigation and flood control rabi season is mostly rainless and dry however the crops in this season can utilize residual soil moisture to some extent at the early part of the season based on hydro climatic characteristics of the three cropping seasons kharif i is partially irrigated kharif ii is mostly rainfed with occasional supplemental irrigated and rabi is a fully irrigated season the predominant cropping patterns 4 8 were the exclusively rice based cropping patterns covering from 34 to 58 of nca in the four agricultural regions total 71 124 rice non rice based cropping patterns covered 36 54 of nca while 12 55 non rice based cropping patterns covered 5 12 of nca in the four agricultural regions the variations of acreage under 16 major crops crop types in the region over the period from 1985 to 2015 are displayed in fig 2 like in the whole country the boro fallow t aman was the largest cropping pattern in the nw region that covered 22 53 of nca in the four agricultural regions wheat fallow t aman maize fallow t aman and potato boro t aman comprise the second third and fourth largest cropping pattern respectively considering these cropping patterns and also other generally practiced cropping patterns and after expert consultation we selected boro fallow aman wheat fallow aman maize fallow aman potato fallow aman fallow aus aman wheat aus aman and wheat boro aman cropping patterns for this study we grouped the minor crops as other rabi for rabi crops and other kharif for wet season crops and put them into other rabi other kharif pattern the other rabi includes pulses spices oilseeds and vegetables of the rabi season and other kharif includes mungbean and vegetables of the kharif season note that for simplicity we presented t aman as aman only and dropped out fallow from the cropping patterns in the dominating cropping patterns boro aman potato wheat and maize were the major crops aus was also found in many occasions in other cropping patterns so we selected these crops and other rabi and other kharif for this study the variations of acreage under the selected crops crop types over the period from 1985 to 2015 are shown in fig 2 2 3 determination of crop evapotranspiration effective rainfall and irrigation requirement actual crop evapotranspiration et total effective rainfall ter crop usable effective rainfall er and irrigation requirement ir were estimated by using the daily soil water balance swb simulation model which is exactly similar to cropwat model allen et al 1998 for calculation of effective rainfall the swb model utilized the method of usda soil conservation service 1993 et comprises evaporation from soil and vegetative surfaces and transpiration from plants and is calculated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration by crop coefficient that expresses the difference in evapotranspiration between the cropped surface and reference grass surface the growing period of the crops was divided into three distinct growth stages initial mid and end seasons the fao recommended crop coefficients of different crops were adjusted by considering minimum relative humidity wind speed and crop height following allen et al 1998 ter is the amount of rainfall after deducting all types of losses and available for usage by crops while er is that portion of ter which crops can actually utilize ter is calculated as 1 ter r t i a 2 r t s i a where ter is accumulated depth of total effective rainfall to time t r t is total accumulated rainfall to time t i a is initial abstraction by soil and s is potential storage in the soil in principle er cannot exceed the consumptive use et if it does the lower value of the two is taken as er ir is the quantity of water that must be supplied to crops throughout the growing season and calculated from the daily et the swb model was written using excel vba program to perform calculations for one or more weather climate sequences locations crops and soils in a single run the outputs can be either annual or daily as desired by the user the daily water balance is expressed by allen et al 1998 2 d r

et i dp i for more details on swb model the readers are referred to mainuddin et al 2015 the important soil properties that are input to the swb model are field capacity wilting point water holding capacity and percolation rate pertinent soil properties e g saturation point field capacity and wilting point were determined using the us soil triangle hydraulic properties calculator http www pedosphere ca resources texture triangle us cfm by utilizing these soil parameters the swb model was parameterized crop coefficients and yield response factors were adopted from the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 the durations of the crop growing period were selected from field observations the lengths of growth stages of rice varieties were taken primarily from the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 and adjusted based on the actual duration of rice crop in the fields ahmad et al 2014 calibrated the swb model based actual crop evapotranspiration et against remote sensing based et for the study region the calibration procedure was detailed in mainuddin et al 2015 and kirby et al 2015 they parameterized the model using field data and estimated et with the calibrated model and compared with district wise all 16 districts in nw region remote sensing based estimates of et over the period from 2000 to 2015 the two estimates agreed fairly well with a determination coefficient of 0 86 and the maximum difference of the monthly average et estimates between the two methods was only 5 4 a comprehensive description of the performance evaluation of the two methods is provided by peña arancibia et al 2020 based on the stated calibrations and validations we are assertive that swb model based et is the reliable estimate of actual crop evapotranspiration used in this study we estimated et ter er and ir for eight major crops and cropping patterns of all 16 districts in the nw region for 31 years 1985 2015 also estimated were the volumetric quantities of et er and ir for each crop by multiplying et er and ir by the area under each crop the volumetric quantity of et er and ir was summed up district wise for all crops crop wise for all districts and also for all crops for the study region 2 4 trend analysis the trend of seasonal actual crop evapotranspiration effective rainfall and irrigation requirement and their volumetric quantities of the selected crops and cropping patterns were determined by using mann kendall sens makesens trend statistics salmi 2002 an ms excel template for implementation of the makesens model is accessible freely at https en ilmatieteenlaitos fi makesens the model includes the non parametric mann kendall test that can identify presence of a monotonic increasing or declining trend and the non parametric sen s test that can estimate slope of a linear trend in time series data salmi 2002 makesens makes use of two statistics to estimate trend s statistics and z statistics gilbert 1987 the former is used when the time series contains less than 10 data points while the latter is used when the data points in the time series is 10 for x 1 x 2 x 3 x j representing n data points with x j the data point at time j the s statistics is given as 4 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k where sgn x j x k 1 if x j x k 0 or sgn x j x k 0 if x j x k 0 or sgn x j x k 1 if x j x k 0 the normalized z statistics is expressed as 5 z s 1 v a r s 1 2 for s 0 z s 1 v a r s 1 2 for s 0 z 0 for s 0 the makesens statistics determined trends of seasonal total et er and ir and their volumetric quantities of the selected crops and cropping patterns in terms of z statistics eq 5 slope and intercept of the trend line it also provided statistical significance of the estimated trends in the parameters the z statistics describes a deterministic index for the trend while the intercept and slope determine the trend lines makesens model determines statistical significance of trend at different significant levels such as p 0 10 p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 the significant levels depend on sensitivity of change in data 3 results 3 1 crop evapotranspiration effective rainfall and irrigation requirement 3 1 1 et er and ir of major crops the observed mann kendall trend statistics z supplementary table iii being negative revealed significantly p 0 05 declining trend of actual crop evapotranspiration et of the major crops over the period from 1985 to 2015 in all 16 districts except for aman and other kharif which showed increasing trend positive z of et in most districts with significant trend in nilphamari only fig 3 illustrates significant variations in et among the districts thus revealing spatial variation in et governing climatic parameters in the nw region the spatial distribution of et in the year 1986 2000 and 2015 as illustrated in fig 4 demonstrates that et of the crops decreased over time in most cases in all districts it is noted that expansion of irrigation and hence agricultural water usage did not occur uniformly during the entire period of investigation 1985 2015 in bangladesh the rate of irrigation development was slow initially and became rapid after some years but slowed down again when water scarcity started appearing in some regions in order to identify the variation of water usage rate we presented et and ir approximately at three equal time intervals 1986 2000 and 2015 crop usable effective rainfall er showed decreasing trend negative z with the exception that er slightly increased in nowabganj for aus aman boro and other rabi and in pabna natore nilphamari panchagarh and thakurgaon for aman and other kharif with significant increase in nilphamari the decrease in er was mostly significant in sirajganj joypurhat rangpur and thakurgaon the irrigation requirements of the crops that depend on et and er generally revealed decreasing trend except aman and other kharif for which ir showed increasing trend the decrease in ir for most crops was significant except in rangpur dinajpur thakurgaon nilphamari and panchagahr ir increased significantly for aman in naogaon kurigram thakurgaon lalmonirhat and panchagahr and for other kharif in panchagahr ir and its trend showed significant spatial variability over the years due to significant changes in et and er supplementary fig i the crop usable effective rainfall was generally lower than the actual crop evapotranspiration except for aus and other rabi however er was close to et for aman and other kharif in most of the years it was also close to et in the 8 northern districts although total effective rainfall ter was greater than et during the large rainfall events er was lower than et because of non uniform rainfall distribution over the crop period thus necessitating irrigation application table 1 summarizes the minimum maximum and average values of sen s slope s eq 4 for et er and ir for each crop over the 16 districts the details of the magnitudes of variation in et er and ir in terms of s for each crop are given in supplementary table iii we mentioned already that aman and other kharif showed increasing trends in et er and ir in some districts and decreasing trends in the other districts however the rates of variation are mostly lower compared to the other crops table 1 the greatest declining trend in et was for boro 3 48 mm season year and the least declining trend was for other rabi 1 5 mm season year the corresponding decline in er was 1 64 mm season year for boro and 0 35 mm season year for wheat for ir the greatest decline was 2 92 mm season year for boro and least decline was 1 03 mm season year for other rabi 3 1 2 et er and ir of major cropping patterns the mann kendall z for et showed a significant p 0 01 decreasing trend of et except for some cropping patterns in four north western districts dinajpur nilphamari thakurgaon and panchagarh of the nw region supplementary table iv among these four districts et decreased significantly only for aman wheat boro pattern in nilphamari and aman wheat aman potato aman aus and other other patterns in thakurgoan panchagarh and dinajpur the crop usable effective rainfall er showed mostly decreasing trends except in nilphamari nowabganj and pabna in which 3 5 cropping patterns showed slight increasing trends three to four cropping patterns revealed significant decreases in er in rangpur joypurhat and sirajganj in the other districts er decreased significantly for 1 2 cropping patterns only er was lower than et in all districts supplementary fig ii except for aus aman pattern for which er and et were mostly closer since growth period of this cropping pattern was in the rainy season irrigation requirement showed decreasing trends for 2 3 cropping patterns in rajshahi sirajganj and thakurgaon and for 4 8 cropping patterns in all other districts with significant decrease for only 2 cropping patterns in naogaon of the increasing trend in ir only 2 cropping patterns in rajshahi showed significant trends table 2 summarizes the minimum maximum and average values of sen s slope s eq 4 for et er and ir for each cropping pattern over the 16 districts the details of magnitudes of variation in et er and ir for each cropping pattern and district in terms of s are given in supplementary table iv both the maximum and minimum values of s revealed decreasing trend of et for all cropping patterns with the overall average decreasing trend ranging from 1 60 mm year for aman wheat to 5 03 mm year for aman wheat boro pattern the maximum value of s showed increasing trend in er except for aman maize pattern while the minimum value of s showed decreasing trend in er for all cropping patterns with the overall average decreasing trend in er for all cropping patterns the decreasing rate of er varied from 0 66 mm season year for aman wheat to 2 07 mm year for aman wheat aus pattern the maximum values of s were indicative of increasing trend in ir while the minimum values indicated decreasing trend the overall average s showed increasing trend for aman wheat and aman potato patterns and decreasing trend for all other cropping patterns 3 2 volumetric quantity of et er and ir 3 2 1 spatial variation the total quantity of water needed for et er and ir for all the major crops increased in all districts over the years fig 5 the quantity of water expended through et and ir for the crops varied among the districts depending on acreage of the crops and et and ir of the crops fig 5 does not visualize any clear variation of er over the years except for a few districts in which er revealed increasing trend the mann kendal z values table 3 demonstrate highly significant p 0 001 increase in the quantity of water used through et except in kurigram and pabna districts in which the quantity of expended water showed small variation decreased in kurigram and increased in pabna based on sen s slope the maximum rate of increase in the expended water 32 15 mm3 year was in dinajpur and the minimum rate 3 28 mm3 year was in lalmonirhat the average increasing rate being 11 60 mm3 year the quantity of water obtained from effective rainfall increased in 10 districts and decreased in 6 districts with significant increase in bogura naogaon natore nowabganj and rajshahi table 3 irrigation requirement although fluctuated in some years increased in all districts mostly highly significantly p 0 001 with the maximum rate of 32 54 mm3 year in naogaon and minimum rate of 5 24 mm3 year in nowabganj the average rate of increase was 13 43 mm3 year the spatio temporal variation of the irrigation requirement is demonstrated in fig 6 3 2 2 crop wise variation the variation of total volumetric quantities of actual crop evapotranspiration effective rainfall and irrigation requirement for different crops are displayed in fig 7 for the entire nw region the quantities of water expended through et and ir increased systematically over the years only for boro rice for the other crops the quantity of water due to et er and ir increased over some span of the total time period 1985 2015 but decreased over the other span of the total time period the quantities of water due to et and ir increased systematically for wheat up to the year 1999 after which they declined sharply up to the year 2007 before becoming almost stable fig 7 contrasting temporal variation in the quantities of water due to et and ir was found for potato the quantities of water remained almost invariant up to the year 1999 after which they continued increasing until becoming stable in the year 2011 maize was adopted in the crop selection noticeably from 2002 and consequently the quantities of water due to et and ir for this crop gradually increased over the years with a sudden increase in acreage in 2007 the quantities of water due to et for other kharif gradually increased over the years starting from 2002 revealing continuous increase in the acreage of these crops however the quantity of irrigation did not increase noticeably since these crops could utilize increased quantity of rainfall as evident in fig 7 for the remaining crops there was no systematic variation in the quantity of water due to et and ir over the years the results of makesens analysis table 4 provided the significance level and rate of variation of the quantities of water due to et er and ir these water quantities decreased for wheat other rabi and aus with significant decrease for aus and other rabi due to et only for the other crops the quantity of water increased mostly significantly except aman due to et and er fig 8 illustrates the variations of the estimated volumetric quantity of water due to et er and ir for all major crops for the entire nw region the quantities of water due to et and ir increased highly significantly at 166 54 mm3 year and 225 80 mm3 year respectively while that due to er increased significantly at 22 28 mm3 year over the years 4 discussion 4 1 climatic impacts on actual crop evapotranspiration the climatic parameters predominantly control the actual crop evapotranspiration et with variation in the parameters either accelerates et e g increase in temperature and wind speed or suppresses it e g decrease in wind speed and humidity due to climate change temperature has been increasing over the past several decades all over in bangladesh shahid et al 2014 including the nw region mojid et al 2015 kamruzzaman et al 2018 although increased temperature has accelerating effect on et our analysis resulted in significant p 0 05 declining trend of et for all major crops except for aman and other kharif over the period from 1985 to 2015 in all 16 districts table 1 fig 3 declining trend of et was also reported for bogura and dinajpur districts mojid et al 2015 entire nw region acharjee et al 2017a b and bogura and rajshahi districts mojid et al 2020 for aman and other kharif et increased slightly in most of the districts with significant increase in only nilphamari evaluating the relative role of the individual climate parameters on declining et was not the main target of our analysis however our results fully agree with that of mojid et al 2015 and islam et al 2019 the first group of investigators reported decreasing trend of reference crop evapotranspiration during most months of the year for the period from 1990 to 2010 for two north western districts dinajpur and bogura while the second group of investigators observed significant decreasing trends of this evapotranspiration in most growth stages of boro rice over the period from 1984 to 2013 in all districts of bangladesh kader et al 2013 2015 also reported exactly similar results for reference crop evapotranspiration of boro rice for rangpur and dinajpur irrigation requirement of the crops being quantified from et and crop usable effective rainfall er also followed the same trend in our estimate since er did not significantly vary over the years in most of the districts supplementary table iii and table 3 while shahid 2011 did not find appreciable variation in irrigation requirement of boro rice in nw region during the current century acharjee et al 2017b estimated 1 6 decrease in the 2050s and 7 4 decrease in the 2080s in net irrigation requirement of boro rice in this region by using rcp8 5 scenario based on five gcm models rehana and mujumdar 2013 on the other hand reported increase in demand of irrigation water in response to changing climate increase in water demand has been quantified from less than 1 for 2030 in average condition to maximum 3 for 2050 in dry condition mainuddin et al 2015 kirby et al 2016 we demonstrate this increase in irrigation demand as the consequence of reduced effective rainfall table 1 not due to increased actual crop evapotranspiration table 1 fig 3 our observation is strongly supported by the progressively declining rainfall amount in the north western region of bangladesh jahan et al 2010 islam et al 2018 mojid et al 2019 peña arancibia et al 2020 and the very sensitive nature of irrigation requirement to changes in rainfall schlenker et al 2007 the increase or decrease in et depends on the relative contribution of the climatic parameters mojid et al 2015 these investigators identified increase in humidity and decrease in wind speed and sunshine hours as the causes of decreasing et in dinajpur and bogura in spite of warming of the climate acharjee et al 2017b observed decreasing trend of water requirements of boro rice from 1980 to 2013 also because of decrease in wind speed and sunshine hours and increase in humidity our observation and the allied literature thus reveal that the observed climate change in the recent past decades resulted in the decrease in water requirements of crops in the nw region of bangladesh 4 2 quantity of et and ir as influenced by cropping area although our analysis estimated decreasing trend of actual crop evapotranspiration et of the crops except for aman and other kharif fig 3 the volumetric quantity of water expended through et and irrigation requirement ir for the crops increased significantly except in kurigram and pabna districts fig 5 table 3 the quantity of expended water differed among different districts depending on area under different crops and et and ir demands of the crops as illustrated in fig 7 the quantities of water expended through et and ir changed systematically for some crops either over the entire period of investigation e g boro or over some span of the period e g potato maize for the other crops the quantities of water increased over some span and decreased over the other span of the time period e g wheat aus or remained mostly invariant over the temporal scale e g aman we explain these features of the quantities of water for different crops over temporal scale in terms of i variation of acreage of the crops fig 9 ii variation in the quantity of water utilized due to et demand with cropping area fig 10 and iii variation in the quantity of water used due to ir with cropping area fig 11 the area under boro cultivation increased almost systematically for all 16 districts with a slower increase from the middle of the last decade thus showing a plateau for most districts fig 9 although there were systematic spatial variations in the acreage of wheat the variations over the years revealed a similar trend for all districts the acreage of wheat increased until the year 2000 and then continued decreasing up to the year 2009 before it became almost stable or continued increasing slowly in a few districts e g pabna thakurgaon the acreage of both potato and maize showed mostly similar trend it remained unchanged for potato in some districts but continued increasing systematically from the year 1999 while it was almost nil for maize until the year 2001 after which it continued increasing systematically for most of the districts there was a contrasting analogy between the acreage of wheat and boro with that of potato and maize when the cropping area continued decreasing for wheat and reached the plateau for rice the acreage for potato and maize continued increasing these observations reveal farmers spontaneous shifting from wheat and boro cultivations to potato and maize cultivations although wheat is a profitable and low water demanding crop repeated occurrence of blast disease during the past decade caused severe yield loss so many wheat farmers shifted to other crops e g potato maize other rabi to avoid the risk associated with wheat cultivation there was a direct positive correlation of the quantity of water expended through et demand and ir with the cropping area in all districts clearly indicating an adjustment in the cropping patterns by choosing crops plausibly mainly based on availability of irrigation water for the other rabi and other kharif there were no noticeable variations in the cropping area for most of the districts except some systematic increase in area during the last 10 years in 7 districts for other rabi and in 4 districts for other kharif the acreage of aus in all districts revealed a systematic gradual decrease until 2002 after which it remained unchanged at lower levels except in rajshahi nowabganj and naogaon where the acreage increased to some extent the cropping area under aman did not conceivably change in any districts over the period under investigation fig 10 demonstrates that the quantity of water expended due to et demand varied directly with the area under each crop and its relationship for each crop appeared almost unique for all districts so the increase in the quantity of water for each crop due to et demand was analogous to the increase in area under that crop although the quantity of irrigation requirement increased with increasing crop acreage there were variations among different districts and also among different years for the same district fig 11 due to variations of the quantity of crop usable effective rainfall fig 5 nevertheless the variation of the quantity of irrigation requirement for each crop fig 7 was similar to the trend of their acreage over the period under investigation the annual total irrigation requirements for the selected cropping patterns showed different trends over the time period under investigation 1985 2015 as illustrated in fig 12 for the aus aman and aus aman wheat patterns the annual total irrigation requirement showed insignificant p 0 05 decreasing trend while it showed significant increasing trend for the other cropping patterns except for the other other pattern 4 3 scope of rainwater harvesting rainfall may not be always beneficial or required at the period or quantity in which it is obtained some of it may be unavoidably wasted and hence becomes ineffective from the view point of agricultural water usage the effective rainfall is part of the rainfall that directly satisfies the need of the growing crops also the surface runoff after collecting in surface storage when used for crop production is often treated as effective rainfall adnan and khan 2009 the total effective rainfall ter in our analysis was greater than the actual crop evapotranspiration et of aus aman and other rabi in all districts of the nw region while it was much lower than et for the other crops for aus ter was smaller than er in some districts for few years detailed graphical comparisons of ter er and ir for the major crops in all districts of the nw region are provided in supplementary fig i therefore based on seasonal total crop period available total effective rainfall no irrigation was generally needed for aus aman and other rabi a part of ter even appeared remaining unutilized by estimating water requirement for aman for 2005 2012 seasons in tanore upazila of rajshahi district hasan et al 2019 also showed no irrigation requirement for this crop during june to september due to high rainfall ter for aman wheat aman potato aus aman and other other cropping patterns was greater than et in most of the years for most of the districts for the other cropping patterns ter was larger in 50 80 of the years but smaller in the other years in most of the districts detailed visual comparisons of the ter er and ir for the major cropping patterns in all the districts are given in supplementary fig ii note that ter might not be utilized fully as crop usable er by the crops if the distribution of rainfall had not been uniform over the crop periods that rarely happened in reality in the study area a large part of the nw region is drought prone hussain 2017 often with long rainless dry periods 32 48 days depending on duration of the droughts bandudeltas 2015 this means that the rainfall events and magnitudes were not uniformly distributed over the crop periods non uniform distribution in rainfall magnitude particularly the effective rainfall determined the part of et that was to be applied though irrigation although ters for some crops and cropping patterns were larger or comparable to the crops or cropping patterns total et the total effective rainfall could not be utilized because of its non uniform distribution when rainfall occurred at the period of sufficient available soil moisture for crop growth the effective rainfall from that rainfall event could not be utilized by the crops the excess ter from any rainfall event could not be transferred to a next irrigation time for a crop or cropping pattern thus causing wastage of the excess ter and necessitating of irrigation application also the large rainfall events might exceed the soil s retention capacity for upland crops and standing water depths in the rice fields and the excess amounts were lost through surface runoff and deep percolation therefore there remained ample scopes for harvesting rainwater masum et al 2013 in ponds and other storage spaces that can be utilized for irrigation in the following dry season crop cultivation 4 4 cropping pattern selection selection of a cropping pattern is governed by several factors such as crop suitability to local conditions local food habits economic profitability of the produce and availability of inputs for production of the crops among which irrigation water availability is the most crucial one for the water limited nw region irrigation acreage has expanded significantly bbs 2017 in most of the districts of the nw region over the period under our investigation 1985 2015 due to increasing food production especially boro rice potato and maize production fig 9 due to scanty and uncertain rainfall in the dry season october april boro cultivation is fully dependent on irrigation that has already caused scarcity of irrigation water for dry season crop production in some areas of the nw region moreover the average annual rainfall from 1985 to 2015 of the six major weather stations in the nw region fig 1 showed a declining trend of 9 2 mm year mojid et al 2019 peña arancibia et al 2020 consequently bangladesh in general and the nw region in particular are facing unprecedented challenges in the management of its groundwater resources with concerns over sustainability of the resources shamsudduha et al 2009 and likely impacts climate change the water scarcity situations are expected to be much worse in future if irrigated area continues expanding following the current trend fig 9 without any adjustment in crop selection based on available water resources although rice crop will not consume additional quantity of water for its conjunctive use the increasing irrigation command area and warmer climate will require more groundwater to be extracted from the aquifers shahid 2011 this would aggravate the already stressed groundwater resources at many areas e g most of the barind tract of the region to prevent further decline in groundwater levels the government of bangladesh plans to cut groundwater extraction initially by preventing installation of any additional tubewells based on the perception that farmers most often overuse water in their crop fields several on farm water saving measures such as improved irrigation delivery technologies and agronomic practices e g alternate wetting and drying method and conservation practices like zero tillage minimum tillage etc also have been promoted however the effectiveness of the government s policy intervention with reduced groundwater pumping and reduced water application to the fields to check decline in groundwater level is under question mainuddin et al 2020 multiple factors may be responsible for the decline in groundwater level in the southern part of the study region in addition to higher annual extraction of groundwater than the annual recharge recharge to the aquifers also has been declining due to an observed decline in rainfall peña arancibia et al 2020 mojid et al 2019 and reduced deep drainage through the plough pans neumann et al 2009 or from a combination of both with declining rainfall the overlying zone of the aquifers will be saturated only for a shorter period at the later part of the monsoon period this will limit potential for groundwater recharge in the area peña arancibia et al 2020 also as more and more of the landscapes have been brought under irrigated rice cultivation over the years 45 47 landscapes are puddled every dry season peña arancibia et al 2020 that reduces groundwater recharge by greatly reducing deep percolation of water in the rice fields neumann et al 2009 the most convincing possible solution to the problem will be to reduce groundwater pumping for irrigation in terms of net water use crop evapotranspiration in areas where the annual recharge is less than the net water usage unless aquifers water reserve has been increased by recharge enhancement reduced pumping can be adopted by replacing high water demanding boro rice with low water demanding non rice crops such as wheat maize pulses and oilseeds due to scarcity of irrigation water many farmers in the region already have been compelled to shift from high water demanding boro rice to low water demanding potato vegetables fruit etc this motivation in crop selection is being guided by significant differences in the quantities of irrigation requirements for different crops and cropping patterns fig 3 supplementary figs i and ii consequently appropriate planning of agriculture by selecting proper cropping pattern s based on available water for irrigation shall remain a major policy option for the future to continue agricultural production in the nw region however shifting the cropping patterns will also have some restrictions because of food habits and customs of the local people along with crop selection serious efforts to increase water availability for irrigation will also be needed for example by harvesting rainwater enhancing natural recharge and adopting safe techniques for artificial recharge to groundwater aquifers during the wet season in the recent years the government has been emphasizing to increase surface water usage through excavation of canals ponds and conservation of river water these surface water sources will also help sustaining groundwater irrigation by enhancing recharge however a comprehensive reconsidering of the current policy of sustainable groundwater irrigation in the region is crucial 5 conclusions the nw region of bangladesh has been recognized to exacerbate uncertainty of water supply and increase extreme hydrological events like droughts and erratic rainfalls hence local level actual crop evapotranspiration et total and crop usable effective rainfalls ter and er respectively and irrigation requirement ir of major crops and cropping patterns are key elements for the region s long term agricultural planning and water resources management the estimated changes in et ter er and ir during 1985 2015 provide clear insights into the effects of climate change on these hydrological parameters significant p 0 05 decreasing trend of et of most dry season crops and cropping patterns exposed overall suppressing effect of climate change on crop water demand significantly decreasing trends of er for most crops in some areas demonstrate the necessity of fulfilling more crop water demand from irrigation in the future in response to expanding boro rice area the seasonal total et and ir increased systematically until the rate of increase broke down during 2005 2010 with increasing crop acreage inappropriate structure of crop planting high irrigation share and often low water productivity the shortage of water resources is becoming increasingly critical in many areas of the region the water shortage forced shifting from the higher water demanding boro rice to lower water demanding potato wheat maize and other vegetables cultivation therefore continuous adjustment of irrigation based crop planning is essential for optimum agricultural production by resource optimization knowledge on historical trends will be also important to assess whether or not demand of groundwater will increase in the future beyond its unsustainable levels the novelty of this study is that we estimated et er ter and ir for all major crops and cropping patterns and quantified these water parameters volumetrically based on acreage of the crops for all districts in the nw region to our knowledge no other study has yet generated such detailed information for this whole region in this study we did not make any estimates of the water parameters for future periods however this method for estimating for the historical period will also be applicable for prediction the methodology and findings of this study can be used for periodic evaluation of crop suitability and cropping patterns based on available water resources in the study areas and other areas as well future research can focus on optimizing acreage for different crops and cropping patterns under climate change conditions so as to maximize economic benefit from crop production and maintain sustainable level of groundwater use declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

10105,comprehensive information on the past trend of local level water usage of the cultivated crops is important for agricultural planning and forecasting water needs this vital information is however deficient for the north west nw region of bangladesh we estimated actual crop evapotranspiration et total and crop usable effective rainfalls ter and er respectively and irrigation requirement ir of 8 major crops and 8 cropping patterns over historical period 1985 2015 by using swbcropwat model and trends of these water parameters by using makesens tool for the 16 districts of the region et of the rabi crops and cropping patterns revealed significant p 0 05 decreasing trends in all districts the average decrease being 13 31 in different districts er decreased significantly for most dry season crops in 4 districts ter was often greater than er for kharif crops which could not fully utilize ter always because of its non uniform temporal distributions ir showed significantly decreasing trend for the rabi crops in 11 districts and increasing trend for the kharif crops in 5 districts although et and ir decreased in most cases their total volumetric quantities showed significantly increasing trends due to expanded irrigated area in 16 districts over time ir increased by 27 186 in different districts because of water scarcity and prospective economic benefit farmers have been spontaneously adjusting crop selection shifting from higher water demanding crops to lower water demanding crop cultivation during the last two decades our information would guide planning the agriculture of the nw region by selecting appropriate crops based on sustainable limit of groundwater resources the employed methodology can evaluate crop suitability periodically for adjustment in any area keywords intensive irrigation crop suitability crop planning sustainability 1 introduction global water consumption has been increasing rapidly over the recent years because of accelerated economic and social developments irrigated agriculture being the largest water consuming sector is currently consuming 70 of the total water usage boretti and rosa 2019 and facing competing demands from other sectors like industrial and domestic sectors this reality along with climate change is leading to an inevitable water crisis guo and shen 2016 in many regions of the world agricultural production is already being adversely affected fao 2016 and will be affected in the future zhang et al 2013 by rising temperature changing precipitation patterns incidence of extreme events e g floods and droughts rising sea level and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide content in the ganges and brahmaputra basins increasing trend in temperature ipcc 2007 and rainfall particularly in wet season has been predicted moors et al 2011 mulligan et al 2011 jeuland et al 2013 masood et al 2015 climate change will directly affect crop evapotranspiration with a consequent increase in irrigation water demand kundzewicz et al 2007 rehana and mujumdar 2013 shen et al 2013 wang 2010 with a predicted global average increase of 7 21 by 2080s depending on climate change scenarios wada et al 2013 and perhaps by more than 40 across europe the united states of america and parts of asia ipcc 2014 seasonal irrigation demand has been predicted to increase by 13 23 de silva et al 2007 and 15 20 diaz et al 2007 by 2050 of the contrasting results zhang and cai 2013 estimated slightly decline in irrigation water requirements at the global scale despite the projected warmer climate elliott et al 2014 reported slightly increasing trend in global irrigation requirements taking into account the effect of co2 but likely decreasing trend without considering the effects of co2 water resources will likely decrease in many mid latitude and dry subtropical regions and increase at high latitudes and in many humid mid latitude regions ipcc 2014 climate variability and change influence groundwater systems taylor et al 2013 recharge to groundwater may decline in the future due to less number of short duration high intensity rainfall events kumar 2012 shah 2009 the reduced recharge may cause falling of groundwater levels in some regions such as the barind tract fig 1 of the north west nw bangladesh kirby et al 2013 mojid et al 2019 the decrease of surface water and groundwater resources in dry subtropical regions will intensify competition for water by different users with negative impact on regional water energy ecosystem services environmental health food security and agricultural productivity li et al 2010 ipcc 2014 hong et al 2016 mo et al 2017 the rivers in the southern himalayas support huge scale crop cultivation during november to march april a reduction in dry season flows due to climate change would have grim adverse impact on the lives of over a billion people in asia un world water assessment programme 2009 thus the cited studies share a common conclusion that climate change will very likely affect agriculture deleteriously thereby threatening global food security ipcc 2013 2014 therefore application of water and its managed usage have become a crucial issue in raising agricultural productivity and ensuring food security with limited water resources irrigated crop production remains essential to sustainable agricultural development and food security in many countries for example in bangladesh rice constitutes 93 4 of the total cereal production bbs 2017 and approximately 86 of the total water usage is attributed to the agricultural sector of which 70 is used to rice cultivation alone chowdhury 2010 the projected population in the country 185 million in 2030 and 202 million in 2050 united nations 2017 will require a further 12 4 and 21 0 million tons of rice by the year 2030 and 2050 respectively mainuddin and kirby 2015 a typical example of an intensive agricultural and irrigated area is the nw region of bangladesh where 78 of the total irrigated area is covered with groundwater hasanuzzaman et al 2017 mainuddin et al 2019 due to limited availability of surface water bbs 2017 consequently in some areas the groundwater levels have been declining continuously ahmad et al 2014 salem et al 2017 mojid et al 2019 also the impacts of climate change are evident in the region in the forms of variations in temperature inconsistent rainfall patterns shortened rainy season intense rainfall events and increased number of droughts mojid 2020 with adverse effects on crop production acharjee et al 2017a agriculture will continue ingesting more water in the next decades cawma 2007 and increased usage of groundwater compared to its current rate seems a most likely scenario the usages of water in domestic and industrial sectors are also rising with a predicted increase of 100 and 440 by 2030 and 2050 respectively bdp2100 2017 so there will be growing competition for getting water among the various water use sectors hanjra and qureshi 2010 consequently drought risk shahid and behrawan 2008 groundwater sustainability dey et al 2017 kirby et al 2015 peña arancibia et al 2020 and climate change impacts shamsudduha et al 2009 mainuddin et al 2015 kirby et al 2016 are considered the serious challenges for irrigation water availability and management estimating crop water demand is essential for forecasting irrigation and managing agricultural water hossain et al 2017 since demand management is regarded as an essential part of the overall solution of water scarcity shen et al 2013 the consequences of climate change are regionally specific mojid et al 2015 2016 and studies based on large spatial scales generally lack sufficient details required for local water management a clear understanding of variations in water requirement in response to the variations in local climate parameters is necessary in crop planning and water management to adapt to the changing climate field 2014 wang et al 2015 acharjee et al 2017b ahmad et al 2019 information on crop water requirements is also needed for selection of crops and cropping patterns and their irrigation scheduling knowledge on the amount of water demand is particularly crucial for decision making about the agricultural planning of the nw region of bangladesh understanding historical trends of water demand is also crucial to assess future water and food security khan et al 2017 kirby et al 2017 accurate quantification of crop water requirement and irrigation water demand by taking into account crop usable effective rainfall and analysis of their spatial and temporal variability are important to improve agricultural water management towards its sustainable usage there is a large body of literature on various aspects of water management e g

2020 for the nw region these studies mostly addressed their specific issue s for either a smaller area in the region or a single crop or only a few crops in particular areas of the region leading to only partial information we are not aware of any study that estimated crop water demand crop usable effective rainfall and irrigation requirement for all major crops and cropping patterns taking into account different soil types for all 16 districts of the region over long temporal scale therefore this study was planned to estimate these hydrologic parameters for the major crops and cropping patterns and trends of the hydrologic parameters for all 16 districts for the period from 1985 to 2015 and to compare their spatial and temporal variability also estimated in this study are the volumetric quantity of water demand for the crops and cropping patterns for all districts and the whole region along with their trends over the same time period soil water balance swb simulation model mainuddin et al 2015 can estimate actual crop evapotranspiration and irrigation requirement by utilizing the cropwat model of allen et al 1998 and the method of usda soil conservation service 1993 it provides identical results to the fao cropwat 8 0 model mainuddin et al 2020 under identical conditions the basic functions of the cropwat model include the calculation of reference evapotranspiration crop water requirements as well as crop and scheme irrigation it loops automatically through several climate regions soils crops and irrigation rules to avoid manually setting up and running many input files thus providing advantages over the cropwat model and hence was employed in this study mann kendall sens makesens statistics based on non parametric mann kendall tests is a well known method for determining trends and drift of time series data salmi 2002 this statistic is applicable for both monotonic and non monotonic trends and was adopted in this study to determine the trend of crop evapotranspiration effective rainfall and irrigation requirement and their volumetric quantities the estimated water demand based on cropping area will help understanding of the relationship between irrigation development and water usage and hence likely future water demand in the region hossain et al 2017 based on food demand and associated cropping area this will also provide information on whether or not the demand of groundwater will increase and exceed sustainable levels ahmad et al 2014 salem et al 2017 the historical trends of water demand can be utilized to identify the sustainable limit for groundwater use the information generated will ultimately help planning agriculture of the region by taking into account food demand and groundwater sustainability issues 2 methodology 2 1 main features of the nw region the north west nw region of bangladesh comprises rajshahi and rangpur divisions two of eight large administrative units of the country with each division is divided into eight administrative districts the districts are bogura chapainawabganj joypurhat naogaon natore pabna rajshahi and sirajganj in rajshahi division and thakurgaon rangpur panchagar nilphamari lalmonirhat kurigram gaibandha and dinajpur in rangpur division fig 1 the region is within 23 47 n to 25 50 n latitude and 88 01 e to 89 48 e longitude and situated on the west of the jamuna river name of the brahmaputra river in bangladesh and north of the padma river name of the ganges river in bangladesh it includes the barind tract which comprises most parts of the dinajpur rangpur pabna rajshahi bogura joypurhat and naogaon and some parts of nowabganj and gaibanda districts fig 1 the barind tract is mostly a drought prone water scarce area often causing distressing effects on agricultural production and livelihood of the people hussain 2017 the nw region has both a dry in winter and a humid in monsoon period the average annual rainfall over 1985 2010 varied from 1273 mm to 2515 mm of which 82 occurred during may to october monsoon and the remaining occurred during november to april dry season less than 6 rainfall occurs during the irrigation period january to april of boro rice shahid 2011 the lowest average annual rainfall 1428 mm was in the barind tract and the highest 2262 mm in the northern area mostly rangpur division rainfall varies widely from year to year coefficient of variation cv 20 24 average monthly temperature varies between 25 c and 35 c during the warmest period and between 9 c and 15 c during the coolest period banglapedia 2014 average monthly relative humidity ranges between 62 and 87 obtained correspondingly in march and july the mean annual relative humidity is 78 jahan et al 2010 the average annual reference evapotranspiration is 1309 mm which varies spatially and temporally cv 6 8 the highest reference evapotranspiration 1366 mm is observed in ishurdi in pabna district and the lowest 1251 mm in rangpur fig 1 forty four percent 44 of the reference evapotranspiration occurred during dry season and 56 during monsoon approximately 73 land area of the nw region is used for agriculture and the lands used for single double and triple cropping are 15 56 and 29 respectively in rajshahi division and 8 64 and 27 respectively in rangpur division bbs 2017 a large variety of different crops are grown in this region of which rice boro aus and aman wheat potato maize jute sugarcane mustard and vegetables are notable most of these crops except aman jute and sugarcane are cultivated during the dry period november april boro rice being the dominant dry period crop is cultivated on 70 of the cultivable area during december to may acharjee et al 2017a 2 2 data collection daily climatic data such as rainfall temperature wind speed sunshine duration solar radiation and relative humidity of the six available meteorological stations bogura rajshahi ishurdi rangpur dinajpur sayedpur fig 1 in the nw region for the period from 1985 to 2015 were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department these climate data for the other districts in the region were estimated by taking the same values of an adjacent district when most of its area was close to the districts whose climate data was to be estimated or taking average of the climate data of the adjacent districts it is noted that the total area of the nw region is 34 515 square kilometers and the six meteorological stations fairly represented weather data for the region so the estimated climate data also fairly represented climate data for the districts without having meteorological stations information on crops and cropping patterns for different districts were extracted from islam et al 2017 shirazy et al 2017 rashid et al 2017 and zaman et al 2017 the major soil types textural classes of the districts were collected from the soil resources development institute of bangladesh the hydraulic parameters of the soils such as water content at field capacity and saturation residual soil water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity were derived from available data base based on soil textural classes and given in supplementary table i data on the length of growth stage crop co efficient root depths depletion factors yield reduction factors planting sowing date crop growth duration harvesting date maximum ponding depth minimum ponding depth and refill ponding depth to be used in the swb model were collected from sub districts known as upazilas and district agriculture offices and given in supplementary table ii year wise areas under each crop in each district were also collected from these offices it is noted that before 2006 2007 the data on crop areas were based on the five earlier greater districts bogura dinajpur pabna rajshahi and rangpur such data for the current 16 districts are available only after that period so for our calculation the crop areas of the earlier years for the current 16 districts were backfilled by allocating areas of the earlier five districts to the current 16 districts in the same ratios as they occur in the later years in the 16 districts there are 316 cropping patterns throughout bangladesh excluding the very minor ones of which the five dominant ones are rice containing cropping patterns covering 51 of the net cropped area nca the most dominant cropping pattern is boro fallow t aman transplanted aman that covers 27 of nca nasim et al 2017 in terms of the crops and cropping patterns the whole nw region has been divided into four major agricultural regions nasim et al 2017 bogura region comprising bogura joypurhat pabna and sirajganj dinajpur region comprising dinajpur thakurgaon and panchagarh rajshahi region comprising rajshahi naogaon chapainawabganj and natore and rangpur region comprising rangpur gaibandha nilphamari lalmonirhat and kurigram total number of cropping patterns was 177 in bogura islam et al 2017 112 in dinajpur shirazy et al 2017 172 in rajshahi rashid et al 2017 and 134 in rangpur zaman et al 2017 agricultural region there are 3 cropping seasons in bangladesh known as kharif i march june kharif ii july october and rabi november february kharif i is pre monsoon period and characterized by unpredictable rainfall which fluctuates in timing regularity and intensity over the years during this period field soils become dry and wet sporadically kharif ii is monsoon period during which there remains enough soil moisture to support rainfed crops for most of this season rainfall exceeds potential evapotranspiration however most crops often face occasional drought and flood specifically in areas without provisions of irrigation and flood control rabi season is mostly rainless and dry however the crops in this season can utilize residual soil moisture to some extent at the early part of the season based on hydro climatic characteristics of the three cropping seasons kharif i is partially irrigated kharif ii is mostly rainfed with occasional supplemental irrigated and rabi is a fully irrigated season the predominant cropping patterns 4 8 were the exclusively rice based cropping patterns covering from 34 to 58 of nca in the four agricultural regions total 71 124 rice non rice based cropping patterns covered 36 54 of nca while 12 55 non rice based cropping patterns covered 5 12 of nca in the four agricultural regions the variations of acreage under 16 major crops crop types in the region over the period from 1985 to 2015 are displayed in fig 2 like in the whole country the boro fallow t aman was the largest cropping pattern in the nw region that covered 22 53 of nca in the four agricultural regions wheat fallow t aman maize fallow t aman and potato boro t aman comprise the second third and fourth largest cropping pattern respectively considering these cropping patterns and also other generally practiced cropping patterns and after expert consultation we selected boro fallow aman wheat fallow aman maize fallow aman potato fallow aman fallow aus aman wheat aus aman and wheat boro aman cropping patterns for this study we grouped the minor crops as other rabi for rabi crops and other kharif for wet season crops and put them into other rabi other kharif pattern the other rabi includes pulses spices oilseeds and vegetables of the rabi season and other kharif includes mungbean and vegetables of the kharif season note that for simplicity we presented t aman as aman only and dropped out fallow from the cropping patterns in the dominating cropping patterns boro aman potato wheat and maize were the major crops aus was also found in many occasions in other cropping patterns so we selected these crops and other rabi and other kharif for this study the variations of acreage under the selected crops crop types over the period from 1985 to 2015 are shown in fig 2 2 3 determination of crop evapotranspiration effective rainfall and irrigation requirement actual crop evapotranspiration et total effective rainfall ter crop usable effective rainfall er and irrigation requirement ir were estimated by using the daily soil water balance swb simulation model which is exactly similar to cropwat model allen et al 1998 for calculation of effective rainfall the swb model utilized the method of usda soil conservation service 1993 et comprises evaporation from soil and vegetative surfaces and transpiration from plants and is calculated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration by crop coefficient that expresses the difference in evapotranspiration between the cropped surface and reference grass surface the growing period of the crops was divided into three distinct growth stages initial mid and end seasons the fao recommended crop coefficients of different crops were adjusted by considering minimum relative humidity wind speed and crop height following allen et al 1998 ter is the amount of rainfall after deducting all types of losses and available for usage by crops while er is that portion of ter which crops can actually utilize ter is calculated as 1 ter r t i a 2 r t s i a where ter is accumulated depth of total effective rainfall to time t r t is total accumulated rainfall to time t i a is initial abstraction by soil and s is potential storage in the soil in principle er cannot exceed the consumptive use et if it does the lower value of the two is taken as er ir is the quantity of water that must be supplied to crops throughout the growing season and calculated from the daily et the swb model was written using excel vba program to perform calculations for one or more weather climate sequences locations crops and soils in a single run the outputs can be either annual or daily as desired by the user the daily water balance is expressed by allen et al 1998 2 d r

et i dp i for more details on swb model the readers are referred to mainuddin et al 2015 the important soil properties that are input to the swb model are field capacity wilting point water holding capacity and percolation rate pertinent soil properties e g saturation point field capacity and wilting point were determined using the us soil triangle hydraulic properties calculator http www pedosphere ca resources texture triangle us cfm by utilizing these soil parameters the swb model was parameterized crop coefficients and yield response factors were adopted from the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 the durations of the crop growing period were selected from field observations the lengths of growth stages of rice varieties were taken primarily from the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 and adjusted based on the actual duration of rice crop in the fields ahmad et al 2014 calibrated the swb model based actual crop evapotranspiration et against remote sensing based et for the study region the calibration procedure was detailed in mainuddin et al 2015 and kirby et al 2015 they parameterized the model using field data and estimated et with the calibrated model and compared with district wise all 16 districts in nw region remote sensing based estimates of et over the period from 2000 to 2015 the two estimates agreed fairly well with a determination coefficient of 0 86 and the maximum difference of the monthly average et estimates between the two methods was only 5 4 a comprehensive description of the performance evaluation of the two methods is provided by peña arancibia et al 2020 based on the stated calibrations and validations we are assertive that swb model based et is the reliable estimate of actual crop evapotranspiration used in this study we estimated et ter er and ir for eight major crops and cropping patterns of all 16 districts in the nw region for 31 years 1985 2015 also estimated were the volumetric quantities of et er and ir for each crop by multiplying et er and ir by the area under each crop the volumetric quantity of et er and ir was summed up district wise for all crops crop wise for all districts and also for all crops for the study region 2 4 trend analysis the trend of seasonal actual crop evapotranspiration effective rainfall and irrigation requirement and their volumetric quantities of the selected crops and cropping patterns were determined by using mann kendall sens makesens trend statistics salmi 2002 an ms excel template for implementation of the makesens model is accessible freely at https en ilmatieteenlaitos fi makesens the model includes the non parametric mann kendall test that can identify presence of a monotonic increasing or declining trend and the non parametric sen s test that can estimate slope of a linear trend in time series data salmi 2002 makesens makes use of two statistics to estimate trend s statistics and z statistics gilbert 1987 the former is used when the time series contains less than 10 data points while the latter is used when the data points in the time series is 10 for x 1 x 2 x 3 x j representing n data points with x j the data point at time j the s statistics is given as 4 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k where sgn x j x k 1 if x j x k 0 or sgn x j x k 0 if x j x k 0 or sgn x j x k 1 if x j x k 0 the normalized z statistics is expressed as 5 z s 1 v a r s 1 2 for s 0 z s 1 v a r s 1 2 for s 0 z 0 for s 0 the makesens statistics determined trends of seasonal total et er and ir and their volumetric quantities of the selected crops and cropping patterns in terms of z statistics eq 5 slope and intercept of the trend line it also provided statistical significance of the estimated trends in the parameters the z statistics describes a deterministic index for the trend while the intercept and slope determine the trend lines makesens model determines statistical significance of trend at different significant levels such as p 0 10 p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 the significant levels depend on sensitivity of change in data 3 results 3 1 crop evapotranspiration effective rainfall and irrigation requirement 3 1 1 et er and ir of major crops the observed mann kendall trend statistics z supplementary table iii being negative revealed significantly p 0 05 declining trend of actual crop evapotranspiration et of the major crops over the period from 1985 to 2015 in all 16 districts except for aman and other kharif which showed increasing trend positive z of et in most districts with significant trend in nilphamari only fig 3 illustrates significant variations in et among the districts thus revealing spatial variation in et governing climatic parameters in the nw region the spatial distribution of et in the year 1986 2000 and 2015 as illustrated in fig 4 demonstrates that et of the crops decreased over time in most cases in all districts it is noted that expansion of irrigation and hence agricultural water usage did not occur uniformly during the entire period of investigation 1985 2015 in bangladesh the rate of irrigation development was slow initially and became rapid after some years but slowed down again when water scarcity started appearing in some regions in order to identify the variation of water usage rate we presented et and ir approximately at three equal time intervals 1986 2000 and 2015 crop usable effective rainfall er showed decreasing trend negative z with the exception that er slightly increased in nowabganj for aus aman boro and other rabi and in pabna natore nilphamari panchagarh and thakurgaon for aman and other kharif with significant increase in nilphamari the decrease in er was mostly significant in sirajganj joypurhat rangpur and thakurgaon the irrigation requirements of the crops that depend on et and er generally revealed decreasing trend except aman and other kharif for which ir showed increasing trend the decrease in ir for most crops was significant except in rangpur dinajpur thakurgaon nilphamari and panchagahr ir increased significantly for aman in naogaon kurigram thakurgaon lalmonirhat and panchagahr and for other kharif in panchagahr ir and its trend showed significant spatial variability over the years due to significant changes in et and er supplementary fig i the crop usable effective rainfall was generally lower than the actual crop evapotranspiration except for aus and other rabi however er was close to et for aman and other kharif in most of the years it was also close to et in the 8 northern districts although total effective rainfall ter was greater than et during the large rainfall events er was lower than et because of non uniform rainfall distribution over the crop period thus necessitating irrigation application table 1 summarizes the minimum maximum and average values of sen s slope s eq 4 for et er and ir for each crop over the 16 districts the details of the magnitudes of variation in et er and ir in terms of s for each crop are given in supplementary table iii we mentioned already that aman and other kharif showed increasing trends in et er and ir in some districts and decreasing trends in the other districts however the rates of variation are mostly lower compared to the other crops table 1 the greatest declining trend in et was for boro 3 48 mm season year and the least declining trend was for other rabi 1 5 mm season year the corresponding decline in er was 1 64 mm season year for boro and 0 35 mm season year for wheat for ir the greatest decline was 2 92 mm season year for boro and least decline was 1 03 mm season year for other rabi 3 1 2 et er and ir of major cropping patterns the mann kendall z for et showed a significant p 0 01 decreasing trend of et except for some cropping patterns in four north western districts dinajpur nilphamari thakurgaon and panchagarh of the nw region supplementary table iv among these four districts et decreased significantly only for aman wheat boro pattern in nilphamari and aman wheat aman potato aman aus and other other patterns in thakurgoan panchagarh and dinajpur the crop usable effective rainfall er showed mostly decreasing trends except in nilphamari nowabganj and pabna in which 3 5 cropping patterns showed slight increasing trends three to four cropping patterns revealed significant decreases in er in rangpur joypurhat and sirajganj in the other districts er decreased significantly for 1 2 cropping patterns only er was lower than et in all districts supplementary fig ii except for aus aman pattern for which er and et were mostly closer since growth period of this cropping pattern was in the rainy season irrigation requirement showed decreasing trends for 2 3 cropping patterns in rajshahi sirajganj and thakurgaon and for 4 8 cropping patterns in all other districts with significant decrease for only 2 cropping patterns in naogaon of the increasing trend in ir only 2 cropping patterns in rajshahi showed significant trends table 2 summarizes the minimum maximum and average values of sen s slope s eq 4 for et er and ir for each cropping pattern over the 16 districts the details of magnitudes of variation in et er and ir for each cropping pattern and district in terms of s are given in supplementary table iv both the maximum and minimum values of s revealed decreasing trend of et for all cropping patterns with the overall average decreasing trend ranging from 1 60 mm year for aman wheat to 5 03 mm year for aman wheat boro pattern the maximum value of s showed increasing trend in er except for aman maize pattern while the minimum value of s showed decreasing trend in er for all cropping patterns with the overall average decreasing trend in er for all cropping patterns the decreasing rate of er varied from 0 66 mm season year for aman wheat to 2 07 mm year for aman wheat aus pattern the maximum values of s were indicative of increasing trend in ir while the minimum values indicated decreasing trend the overall average s showed increasing trend for aman wheat and aman potato patterns and decreasing trend for all other cropping patterns 3 2 volumetric quantity of et er and ir 3 2 1 spatial variation the total quantity of water needed for et er and ir for all the major crops increased in all districts over the years fig 5 the quantity of water expended through et and ir for the crops varied among the districts depending on acreage of the crops and et and ir of the crops fig 5 does not visualize any clear variation of er over the years except for a few districts in which er revealed increasing trend the mann kendal z values table 3 demonstrate highly significant p 0 001 increase in the quantity of water used through et except in kurigram and pabna districts in which the quantity of expended water showed small variation decreased in kurigram and increased in pabna based on sen s slope the maximum rate of increase in the expended water 32 15 mm3 year was in dinajpur and the minimum rate 3 28 mm3 year was in lalmonirhat the average increasing rate being 11 60 mm3 year the quantity of water obtained from effective rainfall increased in 10 districts and decreased in 6 districts with significant increase in bogura naogaon natore nowabganj and rajshahi table 3 irrigation requirement although fluctuated in some years increased in all districts mostly highly significantly p 0 001 with the maximum rate of 32 54 mm3 year in naogaon and minimum rate of 5 24 mm3 year in nowabganj the average rate of increase was 13 43 mm3 year the spatio temporal variation of the irrigation requirement is demonstrated in fig 6 3 2 2 crop wise variation the variation of total volumetric quantities of actual crop evapotranspiration effective rainfall and irrigation requirement for different crops are displayed in fig 7 for the entire nw region the quantities of water expended through et and ir increased systematically over the years only for boro rice for the other crops the quantity of water due to et er and ir increased over some span of the total time period 1985 2015 but decreased over the other span of the total time period the quantities of water due to et and ir increased systematically for wheat up to the year 1999 after which they declined sharply up to the year 2007 before becoming almost stable fig 7 contrasting temporal variation in the quantities of water due to et and ir was found for potato the quantities of water remained almost invariant up to the year 1999 after which they continued increasing until becoming stable in the year 2011 maize was adopted in the crop selection noticeably from 2002 and consequently the quantities of water due to et and ir for this crop gradually increased over the years with a sudden increase in acreage in 2007 the quantities of water due to et for other kharif gradually increased over the years starting from 2002 revealing continuous increase in the acreage of these crops however the quantity of irrigation did not increase noticeably since these crops could utilize increased quantity of rainfall as evident in fig 7 for the remaining crops there was no systematic variation in the quantity of water due to et and ir over the years the results of makesens analysis table 4 provided the significance level and rate of variation of the quantities of water due to et er and ir these water quantities decreased for wheat other rabi and aus with significant decrease for aus and other rabi due to et only for the other crops the quantity of water increased mostly significantly except aman due to et and er fig 8 illustrates the variations of the estimated volumetric quantity of water due to et er and ir for all major crops for the entire nw region the quantities of water due to et and ir increased highly significantly at 166 54 mm3 year and 225 80 mm3 year respectively while that due to er increased significantly at 22 28 mm3 year over the years 4 discussion 4 1 climatic impacts on actual crop evapotranspiration the climatic parameters predominantly control the actual crop evapotranspiration et with variation in the parameters either accelerates et e g increase in temperature and wind speed or suppresses it e g decrease in wind speed and humidity due to climate change temperature has been increasing over the past several decades all over in bangladesh shahid et al 2014 including the nw region mojid et al 2015 kamruzzaman et al 2018 although increased temperature has accelerating effect on et our analysis resulted in significant p 0 05 declining trend of et for all major crops except for aman and other kharif over the period from 1985 to 2015 in all 16 districts table 1 fig 3 declining trend of et was also reported for bogura and dinajpur districts mojid et al 2015 entire nw region acharjee et al 2017a b and bogura and rajshahi districts mojid et al 2020 for aman and other kharif et increased slightly in most of the districts with significant increase in only nilphamari evaluating the relative role of the individual climate parameters on declining et was not the main target of our analysis however our results fully agree with that of mojid et al 2015 and islam et al 2019 the first group of investigators reported decreasing trend of reference crop evapotranspiration during most months of the year for the period from 1990 to 2010 for two north western districts dinajpur and bogura while the second group of investigators observed significant decreasing trends of this evapotranspiration in most growth stages of boro rice over the period from 1984 to 2013 in all districts of bangladesh kader et al 2013 2015 also reported exactly similar results for reference crop evapotranspiration of boro rice for rangpur and dinajpur irrigation requirement of the crops being quantified from et and crop usable effective rainfall er also followed the same trend in our estimate since er did not significantly vary over the years in most of the districts supplementary table iii and table 3 while shahid 2011 did not find appreciable variation in irrigation requirement of boro rice in nw region during the current century acharjee et al 2017b estimated 1 6 decrease in the 2050s and 7 4 decrease in the 2080s in net irrigation requirement of boro rice in this region by using rcp8 5 scenario based on five gcm models rehana and mujumdar 2013 on the other hand reported increase in demand of irrigation water in response to changing climate increase in water demand has been quantified from less than 1 for 2030 in average condition to maximum 3 for 2050 in dry condition mainuddin et al 2015 kirby et al 2016 we demonstrate this increase in irrigation demand as the consequence of reduced effective rainfall table 1 not due to increased actual crop evapotranspiration table 1 fig 3 our observation is strongly supported by the progressively declining rainfall amount in the north western region of bangladesh jahan et al 2010 islam et al 2018 mojid et al 2019 peña arancibia et al 2020 and the very sensitive nature of irrigation requirement to changes in rainfall schlenker et al 2007 the increase or decrease in et depends on the relative contribution of the climatic parameters mojid et al 2015 these investigators identified increase in humidity and decrease in wind speed and sunshine hours as the causes of decreasing et in dinajpur and bogura in spite of warming of the climate acharjee et al 2017b observed decreasing trend of water requirements of boro rice from 1980 to 2013 also because of decrease in wind speed and sunshine hours and increase in humidity our observation and the allied literature thus reveal that the observed climate change in the recent past decades resulted in the decrease in water requirements of crops in the nw region of bangladesh 4 2 quantity of et and ir as influenced by cropping area although our analysis estimated decreasing trend of actual crop evapotranspiration et of the crops except for aman and other kharif fig 3 the volumetric quantity of water expended through et and irrigation requirement ir for the crops increased significantly except in kurigram and pabna districts fig 5 table 3 the quantity of expended water differed among different districts depending on area under different crops and et and ir demands of the crops as illustrated in fig 7 the quantities of water expended through et and ir changed systematically for some crops either over the entire period of investigation e g boro or over some span of the period e g potato maize for the other crops the quantities of water increased over some span and decreased over the other span of the time period e g wheat aus or remained mostly invariant over the temporal scale e g aman we explain these features of the quantities of water for different crops over temporal scale in terms of i variation of acreage of the crops fig 9 ii variation in the quantity of water utilized due to et demand with cropping area fig 10 and iii variation in the quantity of water used due to ir with cropping area fig 11 the area under boro cultivation increased almost systematically for all 16 districts with a slower increase from the middle of the last decade thus showing a plateau for most districts fig 9 although there were systematic spatial variations in the acreage of wheat the variations over the years revealed a similar trend for all districts the acreage of wheat increased until the year 2000 and then continued decreasing up to the year 2009 before it became almost stable or continued increasing slowly in a few districts e g pabna thakurgaon the acreage of both potato and maize showed mostly similar trend it remained unchanged for potato in some districts but continued increasing systematically from the year 1999 while it was almost nil for maize until the year 2001 after which it continued increasing systematically for most of the districts there was a contrasting analogy between the acreage of wheat and boro with that of potato and maize when the cropping area continued decreasing for wheat and reached the plateau for rice the acreage for potato and maize continued increasing these observations reveal farmers spontaneous shifting from wheat and boro cultivations to potato and maize cultivations although wheat is a profitable and low water demanding crop repeated occurrence of blast disease during the past decade caused severe yield loss so many wheat farmers shifted to other crops e g potato maize other rabi to avoid the risk associated with wheat cultivation there was a direct positive correlation of the quantity of water expended through et demand and ir with the cropping area in all districts clearly indicating an adjustment in the cropping patterns by choosing crops plausibly mainly based on availability of irrigation water for the other rabi and other kharif there were no noticeable variations in the cropping area for most of the districts except some systematic increase in area during the last 10 years in 7 districts for other rabi and in 4 districts for other kharif the acreage of aus in all districts revealed a systematic gradual decrease until 2002 after which it remained unchanged at lower levels except in rajshahi nowabganj and naogaon where the acreage increased to some extent the cropping area under aman did not conceivably change in any districts over the period under investigation fig 10 demonstrates that the quantity of water expended due to et demand varied directly with the area under each crop and its relationship for each crop appeared almost unique for all districts so the increase in the quantity of water for each crop due to et demand was analogous to the increase in area under that crop although the quantity of irrigation requirement increased with increasing crop acreage there were variations among different districts and also among different years for the same district fig 11 due to variations of the quantity of crop usable effective rainfall fig 5 nevertheless the variation of the quantity of irrigation requirement for each crop fig 7 was similar to the trend of their acreage over the period under investigation the annual total irrigation requirements for the selected cropping patterns showed different trends over the time period under investigation 1985 2015 as illustrated in fig 12 for the aus aman and aus aman wheat patterns the annual total irrigation requirement showed insignificant p 0 05 decreasing trend while it showed significant increasing trend for the other cropping patterns except for the other other pattern 4 3 scope of rainwater harvesting rainfall may not be always beneficial or required at the period or quantity in which it is obtained some of it may be unavoidably wasted and hence becomes ineffective from the view point of agricultural water usage the effective rainfall is part of the rainfall that directly satisfies the need of the growing crops also the surface runoff after collecting in surface storage when used for crop production is often treated as effective rainfall adnan and khan 2009 the total effective rainfall ter in our analysis was greater than the actual crop evapotranspiration et of aus aman and other rabi in all districts of the nw region while it was much lower than et for the other crops for aus ter was smaller than er in some districts for few years detailed graphical comparisons of ter er and ir for the major crops in all districts of the nw region are provided in supplementary fig i therefore based on seasonal total crop period available total effective rainfall no irrigation was generally needed for aus aman and other rabi a part of ter even appeared remaining unutilized by estimating water requirement for aman for 2005 2012 seasons in tanore upazila of rajshahi district hasan et al 2019 also showed no irrigation requirement for this crop during june to september due to high rainfall ter for aman wheat aman potato aus aman and other other cropping patterns was greater than et in most of the years for most of the districts for the other cropping patterns ter was larger in 50 80 of the years but smaller in the other years in most of the districts detailed visual comparisons of the ter er and ir for the major cropping patterns in all the districts are given in supplementary fig ii note that ter might not be utilized fully as crop usable er by the crops if the distribution of rainfall had not been uniform over the crop periods that rarely happened in reality in the study area a large part of the nw region is drought prone hussain 2017 often with long rainless dry periods 32 48 days depending on duration of the droughts bandudeltas 2015 this means that the rainfall events and magnitudes were not uniformly distributed over the crop periods non uniform distribution in rainfall magnitude particularly the effective rainfall determined the part of et that was to be applied though irrigation although ters for some crops and cropping patterns were larger or comparable to the crops or cropping patterns total et the total effective rainfall could not be utilized because of its non uniform distribution when rainfall occurred at the period of sufficient available soil moisture for crop growth the effective rainfall from that rainfall event could not be utilized by the crops the excess ter from any rainfall event could not be transferred to a next irrigation time for a crop or cropping pattern thus causing wastage of the excess ter and necessitating of irrigation application also the large rainfall events might exceed the soil s retention capacity for upland crops and standing water depths in the rice fields and the excess amounts were lost through surface runoff and deep percolation therefore there remained ample scopes for harvesting rainwater masum et al 2013 in ponds and other storage spaces that can be utilized for irrigation in the following dry season crop cultivation 4 4 cropping pattern selection selection of a cropping pattern is governed by several factors such as crop suitability to local conditions local food habits economic profitability of the produce and availability of inputs for production of the crops among which irrigation water availability is the most crucial one for the water limited nw region irrigation acreage has expanded significantly bbs 2017 in most of the districts of the nw region over the period under our investigation 1985 2015 due to increasing food production especially boro rice potato and maize production fig 9 due to scanty and uncertain rainfall in the dry season october april boro cultivation is fully dependent on irrigation that has already caused scarcity of irrigation water for dry season crop production in some areas of the nw region moreover the average annual rainfall from 1985 to 2015 of the six major weather stations in the nw region fig 1 showed a declining trend of 9 2 mm year mojid et al 2019 peña arancibia et al 2020 consequently bangladesh in general and the nw region in particular are facing unprecedented challenges in the management of its groundwater resources with concerns over sustainability of the resources shamsudduha et al 2009 and likely impacts climate change the water scarcity situations are expected to be much worse in future if irrigated area continues expanding following the current trend fig 9 without any adjustment in crop selection based on available water resources although rice crop will not consume additional quantity of water for its conjunctive use the increasing irrigation command area and warmer climate will require more groundwater to be extracted from the aquifers shahid 2011 this would aggravate the already stressed groundwater resources at many areas e g most of the barind tract of the region to prevent further decline in groundwater levels the government of bangladesh plans to cut groundwater extraction initially by preventing installation of any additional tubewells based on the perception that farmers most often overuse water in their crop fields several on farm water saving measures such as improved irrigation delivery technologies and agronomic practices e g alternate wetting and drying method and conservation practices like zero tillage minimum tillage etc also have been promoted however the effectiveness of the government s policy intervention with reduced groundwater pumping and reduced water application to the fields to check decline in groundwater level is under question mainuddin et al 2020 multiple factors may be responsible for the decline in groundwater level in the southern part of the study region in addition to higher annual extraction of groundwater than the annual recharge recharge to the aquifers also has been declining due to an observed decline in rainfall peña arancibia et al 2020 mojid et al 2019 and reduced deep drainage through the plough pans neumann et al 2009 or from a combination of both with declining rainfall the overlying zone of the aquifers will be saturated only for a shorter period at the later part of the monsoon period this will limit potential for groundwater recharge in the area peña arancibia et al 2020 also as more and more of the landscapes have been brought under irrigated rice cultivation over the years 45 47 landscapes are puddled every dry season peña arancibia et al 2020 that reduces groundwater recharge by greatly reducing deep percolation of water in the rice fields neumann et al 2009 the most convincing possible solution to the problem will be to reduce groundwater pumping for irrigation in terms of net water use crop evapotranspiration in areas where the annual recharge is less than the net water usage unless aquifers water reserve has been increased by recharge enhancement reduced pumping can be adopted by replacing high water demanding boro rice with low water demanding non rice crops such as wheat maize pulses and oilseeds due to scarcity of irrigation water many farmers in the region already have been compelled to shift from high water demanding boro rice to low water demanding potato vegetables fruit etc this motivation in crop selection is being guided by significant differences in the quantities of irrigation requirements for different crops and cropping patterns fig 3 supplementary figs i and ii consequently appropriate planning of agriculture by selecting proper cropping pattern s based on available water for irrigation shall remain a major policy option for the future to continue agricultural production in the nw region however shifting the cropping patterns will also have some restrictions because of food habits and customs of the local people along with crop selection serious efforts to increase water availability for irrigation will also be needed for example by harvesting rainwater enhancing natural recharge and adopting safe techniques for artificial recharge to groundwater aquifers during the wet season in the recent years the government has been emphasizing to increase surface water usage through excavation of canals ponds and conservation of river water these surface water sources will also help sustaining groundwater irrigation by enhancing recharge however a comprehensive reconsidering of the current policy of sustainable groundwater irrigation in the region is crucial 5 conclusions the nw region of bangladesh has been recognized to

anthesis two irrigation applications were performed at 15 and 30 days after anthesis august 24 and september 8 2016 and august 26 and september 10 2017 respectively flood irrigation was used through the experimental period and the irrigation volume 90 mm was controlled by a flow meter each time during the growing season the rainout shelter was opened on sunny days and closed on rainy days the rainout shelter consisted in a steel structure covered with an iron sheet to prevent lateral wind and rain the sheet was powered by electricity to move on a track doors were installed in the south and north ends of the shelter to keep air flowing and thus prevent a significant increase of temperature inside the shelter upon closing every time rainfall occurred 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 soil

amount of precipitation i is the total amount of irrigation water supplied δs is the initial smc minus the final smc r is the surface runoff and sp is the seepage under the rhizosphere in this study p was zero due to the rainout shelter r was negligible because there was no precipitation runoff and the measured soil water value indicated that drainage was low resulting in negligible sp 2 3 3

application significantly increased the smc across the 30 120 cm soil layers under the w0 treatment at daa30 fig 2 a fig 2 b at harvest smc was lower in the top soil layer 0 20 cm under s1 than under s0 across irrigation treatments during both growing seasons except for the w2 treatments in 2017 compared with s0 smc in s1 under w0 was higher in the 30 60 cm soil layer and lower in the 80 120 cm soil layer at harvest in the two growing seasons at harvest smc was higher in s1 than that in s0 through the 30 120 cm soil layers under both w1 and w2 compared to w0 w1 and w2 irrigation treatments significantly increased smc through the 0 120 cm soil layers at harvest 3 2 evapotranspiration there was no significant effect of the amount of s applied on total evapotranspiration in either growing season irrespective of irrigation treatments except for w1 in 2016 fig 3 however regardless of s treatment w1 and w2 treatments significantly increased evapotranspiration by 14 9 and 21 8 in 2016 and by 20 6 and 29 0 in 2017 respectively compared to the evapotranspiration observed under w0 3 3 aboveground biomass the aboveground biomass was significantly higher when irrigation was used during both the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons table 1 compared to s0 the average aboveground biomass in s1 was enhanced by 4 1 6 5 and 5 6 under w0 w1 and w2 irrigation treatments respectively additionally compared to w0 w1 and w2 significantly increased the aboveground biomass by 10 9 and 21 9 in 2016 20 4 and 31 7 in 2017 respectively regardless of s treatment the interaction between sulfur and irrigation treatments had a significant p 0 00 effect on aboveground biomass which was significantly higher in w0s1 than in w0s0 7 2 in 2017 in w1s1 than in w1s0 8 3 in 2016 and 5 2 in 2017 respectively and in w2s1 than in w2s0 8 4 in 2016 compared to w0s0 the biomass was significantly higher in w1s0 6 8 in 2016 and 21 6 in 2017 and in w2s0 17 3 in 2016 and 34 2 in 2017 compared with w0s1 biomass was significantly higher in w1s1 14 9 in 2016 and 19 3 in 2017 and in w2s1 26 4 in 2016 and 29 4 in 2017 the w0s0 treatment had the lowest biomass whereas the w2s1 treatment showed the highest biomass among all treatments in both growing seasons 3 4 grain yield and yield components supplementary irrigation between anthesis and maturity had a significant effect on kernel number per spike 1000 kernel weight and grain yield tables 2 and 3 compared to w0 kernel number per spike was higher under w1 7 7 and 13 2 and w2 18 1 and 28 8 in the two growing seasons respectively average kernel number per spike for the two growing seasons increased by 10 9 and 9 3 under w1 and by 25 2 and 20 2 under w2 for s0 and s1 conditions respectively in turn 1000 kernel weight was significantly higher for w1 2 7 and 4 2 and w2 6 0 and 7 9 in the two growing seasons respectively compared to w0 average 1000 kernel weight increased by 3 8 and 3 3 under w1 and by 8 0 and 6 2 under w2 in s0 and s1 in the two growing seasons respectively compared to grain yield under w0 grain yield was significantly higher under w1and w2 by 16 1 and 24 6 and by 24 6 and 35 3 in 2016 in 2017 respectively no significant p 0 27 coupling effect by s and irrigation treatment was observed on 1000 kernel weight but significant p 0 00 coupling effects were observed on kernel number per spike and grain yield in both growing seasons the kernel number per spike was significantly enhanced in treatments w1s0 9 8 in 2016 and w2s0 20 3 in 2016 and 31 9 in 2017 compared to the results for w0s0 additionally kernel number per spike was significantly enhanced in w2s1 16 0 in 2016 and 25 9 in 2017 compared to treatment w0s1 similarly grain yield was significantly enhanced in w1s0 17 7 in 2016 and 24 3 in 2017 and in w2s0 26 5 in 2016 and 36 2 in 2017 relative to w0s0 compared to w0s1 grain yield was significantly enhanced in w1s1 14 7 in 2016 and 25 0 in 2017 and in w2s1 26 0 and 34 4 in 2017 regarding the impact of the amount of s in combination with total supplementary irrigation amount between anthesis and maturity on maize productivity grain yield was significantly higher in w0s1 than that in w0s0 6 0 in 2016 and 3 6 in 2017 in w1s1 than that in w1s0 4 2 in 2017 and in w2s1 than that in w2s0 5 6 in 2016 and 2 2 in 2017 the w0s0 treatment produced the lowest kernel number per spike 1000 kernel weight and grain yield whereas the w2s1 treatment produced the highest overall grain yield and yield components 3 5 water productivity the values for wpy and wpbm were significantly higher when s was applied p 0 00 sulfur application significantly increased wpbm 8 3 in 2016 and 8 2 in 2017 and wpy 8 0 in 2016 and 6 9 in 2017 significant p 0 00 coupling effects were observed for wpy and wpbm during both growing seasons thus compared to treatment w0s0 wpbm was significantly lower in w1s0 9 3 during the 2016 growing season similarly wpbm was significantly higher in w1s1 14 1 in 2016 and 8 9 in 2017 than in w1s0 and the same trend was observed for w2s1 in which case wpbm was significantly higher than in w2s0 10 4 in 2016 and 7 8 in 2017 consistently significantly higher wpy was recorded in w0s1 than in w0s0 6 4 in 2016 and 4 3 in 2017 the same trend was noted for w1s1 and w2s1 in comparison with w1s0 and w2s1 respectively specifically wpy was higher in w1s1 8 8 in 2016 and 7 9 in 2017 and in w2s1 7 6 in 2016 and 6 4 in 2017 overall w2s1 rendered the highest values for wpy and wpbm whereas w1s0 resulted in the lowest wpbm while treatment w0s0 had the lowest wpy these results indicate that s application contributed to optimizing water use and consequently maximizing wpy and wpbm 4 discussion an greater understanding of plant drought responses would help to minimize drought related losses and ensure food security for an ever increasing global population ren et al 2020 soil moisture is considered one of the main limiting factors of crop growth as all crop physiological processes are highly dependent on soil moisture availability in this study the top soil layer 0 20 cm showed a lower smc in s1 than that in s0 treatments under both w0 and w1 irrigation treatments at harvest a previous study indicated that s application significantly reduced smc in the 0 30 cm soil layer liu et al 2015 for a comprehensive effect fertilizer and water should be used in combination to reduce water consumption in the w0 treatment smc alternately increased from 0 to 120 cm under s0 and s1 at harvest thus s application increased shallow and deep soil water consumption under water deficit conditions plants showed differentiated growth depending on irrigation treatment and concomitantly evapotranspiration rates were also different fonseca et al 2005 as the number of irrigation events increased the soil stored more water and provided a better moisture condition for crop growth hence the application of s seemingly increased smc and reduce evapotranspiration under conditions of unlimited water supply our findings are consistent with those of a previous report which showed that the effects of drought significantly reduce aboveground biomass tolley et al 2020 application of s significantly increases dry matter accumulation from anthesis to mature especially during drought season xie et al 2017 the application of s can increase photosynthesis leading to an increase in dry matter accumulation arduini et al 2006 which may have occurred in our study given that the aboveground biomass in s1 was higher than in s0 under the same irrigation treatment the reduction of leaf expansion initiated plant dry matter reduction caused by drought resulting in less total dry matter accumulation avramova et al 2016 in this study the aboveground biomass was higher in 2017 than that in 2016 possibly due to air temperature differences between the two growing seasons although the mean maximum air temperature was the same 30 8 for the two growing seasons the mean minimum air temperature was different 21 94 in 2016 22 20 in 2017 consequently accumulated temperature may have affected aboveground dry matter accumulation and grain yield water and nutrients are essential elements for successful crop growth and development maize grain yield has been shown to decrease by 13 0 32 0 under drought stress conditions compared to unlimited water supply consistently with the findings reported herein i e 14 7 2 decrease in grain yield due to limited soil water availability grain growth and leaf senescence are the two main processes occurring during grain filling in grain crops abeledo et al 2020 controlled soil drying during the grain filling period has been shown to induce senescence wang and zhang 2020 this is consistent with the idea that accelerated senescence might reduce crop yield as it occurs when leaf senescence is induced during grain filling by environmental stresses factors such as drought or low soil nitrogen content gregersen et al 2013 in a previous study both under well watered and water deficit conditions maize grain yield was closely associated with total biomass and kernel weight maheswari et al 2016 further the decrease in kernel numbers per spike and 1000 kernel weight was influenced by drought stress and nutrient deficit compared with the control treatment kernel numbers per spike were reduced by 18 9 in the drought treatment liu et al 2020 in our study compared to w0 w1 and w2 irrigation treatments resulted in higher kernel numbers per spike 9 3 10 9 and 20 2 25 2 respectively severe drought stress results in a reduction in dry matter ear length and floret number gonzalez et al 2019 in this study drought stress reduced the kernel numbers per spike and led to a reduction in yield inadequate s nutrition can disturb the uptake of other nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen resulting in deficiency and a decline in protein biosynthesis chlorophyll content and ultimately crop yield capaldi et al 2015 the application of s has been shown to promote dry matter accumulation in the intermediate and late stages of wheat growth resulting in sufficient matter as a basis for an increase in yield xie et al 2017 sulfur application has been shown to compensate for water stress by enhancing wpy and consequently increasing the winter wheat yield xie et al 2017 sulfur application can reduce water consumption at low soil water availability thus in our study wp was higher in s1 than in s0 treatments under all irrigation treatments indicating that all s1 treatment exhibited higher wp than that in s0 while s application did not increase the grain yield of summer maize it decreased evapotranspiration this observation supports the idea that it is very important to apply s for a more sustainable agriculture in maize water relations leading to turgor maintenance as well as overall productivity along with efficient assimilate partitioning and kernel filling under water deficit might contribute to enhanced drought tolerance coupled with high yield maheswari et al 2016 in this study we investigated the effects of the combined application of sulfur and different amount of irrigation water after anthesis on summer maize yield and water productivity however different sulfur sources or placement of sulfur fertilizer may have different effects on these variables under conditions of supplementary irrigation which therefore warrant further research 5 conclusions in this study sulfur application significantly increased aboveground biomass grain yield and smc especially at the 30 120 cm soil depth while decreasing soil water consumption therefore our data clearly showed that sulfur enhanced wpbm and wpy irrespective of irrigation treatment as the number of irrigation events after anthesis increased smc was maintained at high levels and grain yield and wpy increased under both s0 and s1 treatments sulfur application had a compensatory effect on grain yield and wpy and thus a greater water use efficiency was achieved under the three irrigation treatments tested comprehensively we concluded that irrigating maize twice after anthesis w2 in combination with sulfur fertilizer application can sustain a high summer maize grain yield and wpy in the ncp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

digging 150 cm into the ground to prevent lateral soil moisture flow the soil in the experimental plots was a loam soil with the following properties 29 01 mg kg 1 available s 57 70 mg kg 1 available nitrogen 16 55 g kg 1 organic matter 14 4 mg kg 1 available phosphorus and 138 17 mg kg 1 available potassium summer maize was harvested on october 1 2016 and on october 1 2017 2 2 experimental design the experiment was laid in a randomized block design with six treatments and three replicates three irrigation patterns no irrigation after anthesis w0 irrigation at 15 days after anthesis w1 and irrigation at 15 and 30 days after anthesis w2 in combination with two s application rates no s s0 and s s1 for a total of 18 plots before sowing all plots were irrigated and the soil was manually plowed using a shovel to a depth of 20 cm the maize variety used was zhengdan 958 fertilizer containing p2o5 90 kg ha 1 n 90 kg ha 1 k2o 150 kg ha 1 and s 60 kg ha 1 elemental sulfur it can be used as a nutrient and was an ideal form for maize lindemann et al 1991 zhu and maria 2016 and it was only applied in s treatment was applied at sowing along a furrow 10 cm beside each planted row in each plot band placement at 5 8 cm depth to concentrate the source which minimizes soil tie up and reportedly improves root absorption and the addition of s to the starter fertilizer mixture increased early season growth and yield stewart and gordon 2018 at the twelfth leaf stage of growth v12 n 135 kg ha 1 combined with irrigation water was applied and all plants were irrigated again at pre anthesis two irrigation applications were performed at 15 and 30 days after anthesis august 24 and september 8 2016 and august 26 and september 10 2017 respectively flood irrigation was used through the experimental period and the irrigation volume 90 mm was controlled by a flow meter each time during the growing season the rainout shelter was opened on sunny days and closed on rainy days the rainout shelter consisted in a steel structure covered with an iron sheet to prevent lateral wind and rain the sheet was powered by electricity to move on a track doors were installed in the south and north ends of the shelter to keep air flowing and thus prevent a significant increase of temperature inside the shelter upon closing every time rainfall occurred 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 soil

evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et was calculated using the following equation zhang et al 2018 et p i δ s r sp where et is the total water consumption during the crop growing period p is the amount of precipitation i is the total amount of irrigation water supplied δs is the initial smc minus the final smc r is the surface runoff and sp is the seepage under the rhizosphere in this study p was zero due to the rainout shelter r was negligible because there was no precipitation runoff and the measured soil water value indicated that drainage was low resulting in negligible sp 2 3 3 aboveground biomass grain yield and yield components at harvest two rows of 2 0 m in length were randomly selected all samples were air dried down to a grain moisture content grain moisture tester pm8188a japan of approximately 14 ten spikes were randomly selected in each plot and manually counted the number of rows per spike and the number of kernels per row and per spike plants were then threshed using a stationary thresher kty 280 jindadi company china to obtain grain yield and the 1000 kernel weight was measured as the average of three replicates for each plot three plants per plot were used to record aboveground biomass 2 3 4 water productivity water productivity at the grain yield level wpy and water productivity at the biomass level wpbm were calculated using the following equations zhang et al 2018 wp y y et wp bm biomass et where y is the grain yield of summer maize et is the total water consumption during the growing period and biomass is the total aboveground biomass at harvest 2 3 5 statistical analysis differences among treatment means were subjected to analysis of variance anova using the general linear model procedure at a significance level of α 0 05 the normality of variances was tested before performing anova multiple comparisons for significant effects were performed using the least significant difference lsd test at α 0 05 microsoft excel 2010 and pasw statistics 18 were used to organize and analyze the data respectively 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content the amounts of s and irrigation water significantly affected the smc fig 2 sulfur application significantly increased the smc across the 30 120 cm soil layers under the w0 treatment at daa30 fig 2 a fig 2 b at harvest smc was lower in the top soil layer 0 20 cm under s1 than under s0 across irrigation treatments during both growing seasons except for the w2 treatments in 2017 compared with s0 smc in s1 under w0 was higher in the 30 60 cm soil layer and lower in the 80 120 cm soil layer at harvest in the two growing seasons at harvest smc was higher in s1 than that in s0 through the 30 120 cm soil layers under both w1 and w2 compared to w0 w1 and w2 irrigation treatments significantly increased smc through the 0 120 cm soil layers at harvest 3 2 evapotranspiration there was no significant effect of the amount of s applied on total evapotranspiration in either growing season irrespective of irrigation treatments except for w1 in 2016 fig 3 however regardless of s treatment w1 and w2 treatments significantly increased evapotranspiration by 14 9 and 21 8 in 2016 and by 20 6 and 29 0 in 2017 respectively compared to the evapotranspiration observed under w0 3 3 aboveground biomass the aboveground biomass was significantly higher when irrigation was used during both the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons table 1 compared to s0 the average aboveground biomass in s1 was enhanced by 4 1 6 5 and 5 6 under w0 w1 and w2 irrigation treatments respectively additionally compared to w0 w1 and w2 significantly increased the aboveground biomass by 10 9 and 21 9 in 2016 20 4 and 31 7 in 2017 respectively regardless of s treatment the interaction between sulfur and irrigation treatments had a significant p 0 00 effect on aboveground biomass which was significantly higher in w0s1 than in w0s0 7 2 in 2017 in w1s1 than in w1s0 8 3 in 2016 and 5 2 in 2017 respectively and in w2s1 than in w2s0 8 4 in 2016 compared to w0s0 the biomass was significantly higher in w1s0 6 8 in 2016 and 21 6 in 2017 and in w2s0 17 3 in 2016 and 34 2 in 2017 compared with w0s1 biomass was significantly higher in w1s1 14 9 in 2016 and 19 3 in 2017 and in w2s1 26 4 in 2016 and 29 4 in 2017 the w0s0 treatment had the lowest biomass whereas the w2s1 treatment showed the highest biomass among all treatments in both growing seasons 3 4 grain yield and yield components supplementary irrigation between anthesis and maturity had a significant effect on kernel number per spike 1000 kernel weight and grain yield tables 2 and 3 compared to w0 kernel number per spike was higher under w1 7 7 and 13 2 and w2 18 1 and 28 8 in the two growing seasons respectively average kernel number per spike for the two growing seasons increased by 10 9 and 9 3 under w1 and by 25 2 and 20 2 under w2 for s0 and s1 conditions respectively in turn 1000 kernel weight was significantly higher for w1 2 7 and 4 2 and w2 6 0 and 7 9 in the two growing seasons respectively compared to w0 average 1000 kernel weight increased by 3 8 and 3 3 under w1 and by 8 0 and 6 2 under w2 in s0 and s1 in the two growing seasons respectively compared to grain yield under w0 grain yield was significantly higher under w1and w2 by 16 1 and 24 6 and by 24 6 and 35 3 in 2016 in 2017 respectively no significant p 0 27 coupling effect by s and irrigation treatment was observed on 1000 kernel weight but significant p 0 00 coupling effects were observed on kernel number per spike and grain yield in both growing seasons the kernel number per spike was significantly enhanced in treatments w1s0 9 8 in 2016 and w2s0 20 3 in 2016 and 31 9 in 2017 compared to the results for w0s0 additionally kernel number per spike was significantly enhanced in w2s1 16 0 in 2016 and 25 9 in 2017 compared to treatment w0s1 similarly grain yield was significantly enhanced in w1s0 17 7 in 2016 and 24 3 in 2017 and in w2s0 26 5 in 2016 and 36 2 in 2017 relative to w0s0 compared to w0s1 grain yield was significantly enhanced in w1s1 14 7 in 2016 and 25 0 in 2017 and in w2s1 26 0 and 34 4 in 2017 regarding the impact of the amount of s in combination with total supplementary irrigation amount between anthesis and maturity on maize productivity grain yield was significantly higher in w0s1 than that in w0s0 6 0 in 2016 and 3 6 in 2017 in w1s1 than that in w1s0 4 2 in 2017 and in w2s1 than that in w2s0 5 6 in 2016 and 2 2 in 2017 the w0s0 treatment produced the lowest kernel number per spike 1000 kernel weight and grain yield whereas the w2s1 treatment produced the highest overall grain yield and yield components 3 5 water productivity the values for wpy and wpbm were significantly higher when s was applied p 0 00 sulfur application significantly increased wpbm 8 3 in 2016 and 8 2 in 2017 and wpy 8 0 in 2016 and 6 9 in 2017 significant p 0 00 coupling effects were observed for wpy and wpbm during both growing seasons thus compared to treatment w0s0 wpbm was significantly lower in w1s0 9 3 during the 2016 growing season similarly wpbm was significantly higher in w1s1 14 1 in 2016 and 8 9 in 2017 than in w1s0 and the same trend was observed for w2s1 in which case wpbm was significantly higher than in w2s0 10 4 in 2016 and 7 8 in 2017 consistently significantly higher wpy was recorded in w0s1 than in w0s0 6 4 in 2016 and 4 3 in 2017 the same trend was noted for w1s1 and w2s1 in comparison with w1s0 and w2s1 respectively specifically wpy was higher in w1s1 8 8 in 2016 and 7 9 in 2017 and in w2s1 7 6 in 2016 and 6 4 in 2017 overall w2s1 rendered the highest values for wpy and wpbm whereas w1s0 resulted in the lowest wpbm while treatment w0s0 had the lowest wpy these results indicate that s application contributed to optimizing water use and consequently maximizing wpy and wpbm 4 discussion an greater understanding of plant drought responses would help to minimize drought related losses and ensure food security for an ever increasing global population ren et al 2020 soil moisture is considered one of the main limiting factors of crop growth as all crop physiological processes are highly dependent on soil moisture availability in this study the top soil layer 0 20 cm showed a lower smc in s1 than that in s0 treatments under both w0 and w1 irrigation treatments at harvest a previous study indicated that s application significantly reduced smc in the 0 30 cm soil layer liu et al 2015 for a comprehensive effect fertilizer and water should be used in combination to reduce water consumption in the w0 treatment smc alternately increased from 0 to 120 cm under s0 and s1 at harvest thus s application increased shallow and deep soil water consumption under water deficit conditions plants showed differentiated growth depending on irrigation treatment and concomitantly evapotranspiration rates were also different fonseca et al 2005 as the number of irrigation events increased the soil stored more water and provided a better moisture condition for crop growth hence the application of s seemingly increased smc and reduce evapotranspiration under conditions of unlimited water supply our findings are consistent with those of a previous report which showed that the effects of drought significantly reduce aboveground biomass tolley et al 2020 application of s significantly increases dry matter accumulation from anthesis to mature especially during drought season xie et al 2017 the application of s can increase photosynthesis leading to an increase in dry matter accumulation arduini et al 2006 which may have occurred in our study given that the aboveground biomass in s1 was higher than in s0 under the same irrigation treatment the reduction of leaf expansion initiated plant dry matter reduction caused by drought resulting in less total dry matter accumulation avramova et al 2016 in this study the aboveground biomass was higher in 2017 than that in 2016 possibly due to air temperature differences between the two growing seasons although the mean maximum air temperature was the same 30 8 for the two growing seasons the mean minimum air temperature was different 21 94 in 2016 22 20 in 2017 consequently accumulated temperature may have affected aboveground dry matter accumulation and grain yield water and nutrients are essential elements for successful crop growth and development maize grain yield has been shown to decrease by 13 0 32 0 under drought stress conditions compared to unlimited water supply consistently with the findings reported herein i e 14 7 2 decrease in grain yield due to limited soil water availability grain growth and leaf senescence are the two main processes occurring during grain filling in grain crops abeledo et al 2020 controlled soil drying during the grain filling period has been shown to induce senescence wang and zhang 2020 this is consistent with the idea that accelerated senescence might reduce crop yield as it occurs when leaf senescence is induced during grain filling by environmental stresses factors such as drought or low soil nitrogen content gregersen et al 2013 in a previous study both under well watered and water deficit conditions maize grain yield was closely associated with total biomass and kernel weight maheswari et al 2016 further the decrease in kernel numbers per spike and 1000 kernel weight was influenced by drought stress and nutrient deficit compared with the control treatment kernel numbers per spike were reduced by 18 9 in the drought treatment liu et al 2020 in our study compared to w0 w1 and w2 irrigation treatments resulted in higher kernel numbers per spike 9 3 10 9 and 20 2 25 2 respectively severe drought stress results in a reduction in dry matter ear length and floret number gonzalez et al 2019 in this study drought stress reduced the kernel numbers per spike and led to a reduction in yield inadequate s nutrition can disturb the uptake of other nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen resulting in deficiency and a decline in protein biosynthesis chlorophyll content and ultimately crop yield capaldi et al 2015 the application of s has been shown to promote dry matter accumulation in the intermediate and late stages of wheat growth resulting in sufficient matter as a basis for an increase in yield xie et al 2017 sulfur application has been shown to compensate for water stress by enhancing wpy and consequently increasing the winter wheat yield xie et al 2017 sulfur application can reduce water consumption at low soil water availability thus in our study wp was higher in s1 than in s0 treatments under all irrigation treatments indicating that all s1 treatment exhibited higher wp than that in s0 while s application did not increase the grain yield of summer maize it decreased evapotranspiration this observation supports the idea that it is very important to apply s for a more sustainable agriculture in maize water relations leading to turgor maintenance as well as overall productivity along with efficient assimilate partitioning and kernel filling under water deficit might contribute to enhanced drought tolerance coupled with high yield maheswari et al 2016 in this study we investigated the effects of the combined application of sulfur and different amount of irrigation water after anthesis on summer maize yield and water productivity however different sulfur sources or placement of sulfur fertilizer may have different effects on these variables under conditions of supplementary irrigation which therefore warrant further research 5 conclusions in this study sulfur application significantly increased aboveground biomass grain yield and smc especially at the 30 120 cm soil depth while decreasing soil water consumption therefore our data clearly showed that sulfur enhanced wpbm and wpy irrespective of irrigation treatment as the number of irrigation events after anthesis increased smc was maintained at high levels and grain yield and wpy increased under both s0 and s1 treatments sulfur application had a compensatory effect on grain yield and wpy and thus a greater water use efficiency was achieved under the three irrigation treatments tested comprehensively we concluded that irrigating maize twice after anthesis w2 in combination with sulfur fertilizer application can sustain a high summer maize grain yield and wpy in the ncp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10107,increasing irrigation water scarcity is threatening global rice production and sustainability accordingly the cultivation of drought resistant rice varieties has been strongly advocated to reduce the consumption of irrigation water however it remains unclear how the cultivation of drought resistant rice affects greenhouse gas emissions here a two year field experiment was conducted to elucidate the effects of irrigation regimes awd alternate wetting and drying cf continuous flooding and rice varieties drought resistant rice 7y88 and 7y370 and conventional rice hhz on the grain yields and greenhouse gas methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions from paddy fields the experiment was performed in a split plot design with three replications the results showed that awd significantly reduced water inputs and grain yields compared with cf in both rice growing seasons on average 7y88 and 7y370 significantly enhanced the water use efficiency by 37 6 and 51 5 and the grain yields by 33 9 and 47 0 relative to hhz respectively a trade off between ch4 and n2o emissions was observed under irrigation regimes compared with cf awd significantly reduced cumulative ch4 emissions by 64 9 while increased cumulative n2o emissions by 160 0 and decreased the grain yield by 11 6 on average awd also significantly reduced the global warming potential gwp and greenhouse gas intensity ghgi by 42 2 and 31 6 respectively significant differences p 0 05 in ghg emissions gwp and ghgi were observed between drought resistant rice varieties and hhz the rice variety 7y370 resulted in the lowest ch4 and n2o emissions gwp and ghgi among all varieties under both irrigation regimes these results indicate that the rice variety 7y370 can be recommended to simultaneously mitigate gwp and maintain grain yields keywords alternate wetting and drying drought resistant rice global warming potential greenhouse gas intensity water use efficiency 1 introduction as the staple crop for more than half of the world s population rice oryza sativa is planted in an area of 153 million ha which accounts for 11 of the world s arable land faiz ul islama et al 2018 over the past few decades water scarcity has become one of the biggest challenges for sustainable rice production thus it is urgent to develop water saving technologies for rice cultivation xu et al 2015 rice field is also a major anthropogenic source of greenhouse gas ghg emissions kritee et al 2018 accounting for about 50 of total methane ch4 emissions and 10 of total nitrous oxide n2o emissions from cropland respectively ullah et al 2018 wang et al 2017 china is the largest rice producer in the world and accounts for about 28 1 of the global rice production he et al 2020 water resource shortage has caused great challenges to sustainable rice production in china as a result there have been great changes in irrigation regime in china in recent decades guo and zhou 2007 irrigation regimes such as intermittent irrigation and alternating wetting and drying awd irrigation have been widely used as water saving irrigation techniques xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 previous studies have reported that the optimized irrigation can reduce irrigation water use and promote water productivity compared with the conventional continuous flooding cf irrigation in china jiang et al 2016a thakur et al 2016 for awd irrigation water is supplied when the soil water potential at 15 cm below the soil surface reaches 10 to 30 kpa or when the surface water level declines to 15 cm below the soil surface dang hoa et al 2018 awd irrigation has been reported to contribute to a reduction of 15 20 water use in lowland rice cultivation without causing any yield reduction bhatia et al 2004 besides awd irrigation also has the potential to mitigate greenhouse gas ghg emissions lahue et al 2016 reported 57 78 decreases in annual ch4 emissions from rice fields under awd irrigation hence awd irrigation is becoming increasingly popular in asian countries in the context of increasing irrigation water scarcity for rice production chidthaisong et al 2018 hyun hwoi et al 2017 improvement of rice varieties may also hold great promise for both increasing yield and reducing ghg emissions zhang et al 2019 for example new rice varieties with a higher allocation of photosynthates to the seeds may reduce the allocation of photosynthates belowground for methanogens and are thus conducive to the mitigation of ch4 emissions jiang et al 2017b it has been reported that the application of new varieties is a major approach to increase rice yields accounting for almost 50 of yield growth in all developing countries zhang et al 2019 and the replacement of traditional rice varieties with new varieties in

water for crop production in china yu et al 2016 the rice is bred from a female or male parent with good agronomic characters and a strong tolerance to drought sun et al 2016 yu et al 2016 however few studies investigated the effects of drought resistant rice on ghg emissions gorh and baruah 2019 from past research that had been reviewed it is known that drought resistant rice variety and water saving irrigation could mitigate ghg emissions and their appropriate combination could effectively reduce ghg emissions while maintaining rice yield our aim in this study is to specifically quantify the important results for our given drought resistant rice varieties under the alternative wetting drying irrigation regime here a two year field experiment was designed to evaluate single and interaction effects of irrigation regime and rice variety on the yields and ghg emissions from rice field the results can be important contributions to tackling the climate change phenomenon with its attending targeted zero carbon approach as well as making sustainable rice crop production under a limited water resources regime 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site is

year significantly affected cwp table 2 awd significantly enhanced the cwp by 54 3 relative to cf table 3 cwp was not significantly affected by rice variety moreover there were non significant two way or three way interactions on cwp 3 3 doc no3 and nh4 concentrations the soil doc no3 and nh4 concentrations after harvest varied with irrigation regime rice variety and study year table 5 awd decreased doc and nh4 concentrations by an average of 33 9 and 39 2 respectively and enhanced no3 concentration by 78 05 relative to cf compared with hhz 7y88 and 7y370 significantly decreased the doc no3 and nh4 concentrations by 11 5 21 2 and 12 8 and by 14 8 25 9 and 23 4 on average respectively study year significantly affected doc and nh4 concentrations the interaction of irrigation regime rice variety and study year showed significant effects on the soil no3 and nh4 concentrations 3 4 ch4 and n2o emissions similar ch4 flux patterns were observed among all treatments during the rice growing season of 2018 and 2019 fig 2 peaks of ch4 emissions were observed at the tillering and heading stages moreover the peaks of ch4 emissions reached as high as 58 74 mg m 2 h 1 and 61 85 mg m 2 h 1 for hhz under cf in 2018 and 2019 respectively the fluxes ranged from 1 1 to 58 74 mg m 2 h 1 in 2018 and 1 28 61 85 mg m 2 h 1 in 2019 across all treatments seasonal cumulative ch4 emissions under cf reached a total of 582 7 kg ha 1 on average while those under awd were significantly lower by 64 9 table 6 drought resistant rice varieties showed a mitigating effect on ch4 emissions relative to hhz moreover ch4 emissions were not significantly affected by the two way or three way interactions table 2 n2o flux peaks were observed at the first and second topdressing fig 3 the highest flux was observed for hhz under awd which was 0 61 and 0 68 mg m 2 h 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the n2o fluxes under all treatments ranged from 0 to 0 61 mg m 2 h 1 in 2018 and 0 01 0 68 mg m 2 h 1 in 2019 most of n2o was emitted after the topdressing period in the rice growing season which on average accounted for 60 0 of the total n2o emissions as a whole the seasonal cumulative n2o emissions under awd 18 01 kg ha 1 were significantly increased by 160 6 compared with those under cf drought resistant rice obviously decreased n2o emissions relative to hhz under both awd and cf table 6 moreover n2o emissions were not significantly affected by the two way or three way interactions table 2 3 5 gwp and ghgi both gwp and ghgi were significantly affected by irrigation regime and rice variety table 6 compared with cf awd significantly decreased the gwp and ghgi by 43 1 and 33 2 in 2018 and by 41 2 and 30 0 in 2019 respectively among the rice varieties hhz resulted in the highest gwp over the two years of experiment followed by 7y88 and 7y370 in both seasons the ghgi among different varieties followed the order of hhz 7y88 7y370 in general two way or three way interactions showed no effect on the gwp and ghgi table 2 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation regime and rice variety on rice yield and cwp inconsistent results have been reported about the effect of awd on grain yields some studies have reported decreases in rice grain yields under awd lagomarsino et al 2016a linquist et al 2015 xu et al 2015 whereas in other studies it was found that awd caused no yield reduction belder et al 2005 carrijo et al 2018 dong et al 2011 setyanto et al 2018 yao et al 2012b or even increases in yields liu et al 2013 ullah et al 2018 in this study awd significantly decreased the rice grain yield compared with cf table 3 this discrepancy among studies may be attributed to various factors such as drought degree time of implementation rice variety soil moisture monitoring methods weather and soil hydrological conditions of the experimental site linquist et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 decreases in the yield under awd table 3 might due to the decrease in effective panicles and seed setting rate table 4 drought induced reduction of chlorophyll content and performance of chlorophyll in photosynthesis can decrease the photosynthesis rate shukla et al 2013 which may cause the reduction of crop yields thilakarathne et al 2013 about 12 reduction in yields under awd table 3 is huge for the farmers suggesting that the soil water potential of 30 kpa conducted in this study is too dry for rice growth and thus an optimum threshold level of soil water potential or a safe awd should be adopted to avoid yield losses boumanet al 2007 indicated if the rice field is re irrigated to ensure that the water level is not more than 15 cm below the soil surface termed safe awd rice yields would not be reduced carrijo et al 2017 conducted by a meta analysis to discuss awd effect son rice yields and found that when field water level did not drop below 15 cm from the soil surface or soil water potential was 20 kpa the yields were not significantly reduced in most cases therefore in this study an optimum threshold level of soil water potential under awd 20 kpa or field water level 15 cm might be proposed for maintaining rice yield in this study the yields of hhz 7y88 and 7y370 showed significant differences regardless of irrigation regime table 3 the superiority of the drought resistant rice varieties 7y88 and 7y370 in yields over conventional rice variety hhz under awd may be ascribed to the genetic and physiological factors 7y88 and 7y370 are three line hybrid rice varieties with huhan 7a as the female parent and r370 as the male parent the female parent huhan 7a has good agronomic characters and a strong tolerance to drought yu et al 2016 differences in photosynthetic efficiency among rice varieties may also contribute to differences in yield potential among them under awd gorh and baruah 2019 hence the larger number of effective panicles and spikelets as well as the higher seed setting rate of 7y88 and 7y370 than of hhz table 4 may be ascribed to higher photosynthetic rates irrigation regime was found to significantly affect cwp in this study awd reduced the amount of water consumption by 61 5 and increased the cwp by 53 2 on average relative to cf table 3 which may be due to decreases in seepage percolation and evapotranspiration of water lampayan et al 2014 moreover awd may promote the growth and development of the deeper root system to enhance the tolerance of rice plants to water stress thakur et al 2016 yang et al 2012 awd can also increase the proportion of productive tillers to promote plant growth which indirectly improves the cwp yang and xie 2010 similar results have been reported by previous studies wang et al 2020 xu et al 2015 yang et al 2018 4 2 effects of irrigation regime and rice variety on ch4 and n2o emissions in this study peaks in ch4 fluxes were found at the tillering and heading stages of rice fig 5 which might be due to the enhancement of ch4 transportation through rice plants induced by augmented aerenchyma cells at the tillering stage gupta et al 2002 and increases in ch4 production owing to the increase in c resource table 5 as well as mobilization of more micronutrients for methanogens due to increased root exudation at the heading stage lu et al 2000 n2o flux peaked in the late july and late august under all treatments fig 6 these peaks of n2o emissions could be due to increases in the availability of n for soil microbes from urea topdressing during these periods xu et al 2015 awd was found to dramatically decrease the ch4 emissions in this study table 6 methane is an end product of anaerobic organic matter decomposition conrad 2002 the establishment of strictly anaerobic soil conditions 200 mv is a prerequisite for methanogenic activity pittelkow et al 2013 xu et al 2003 under continuous flooding the decreases in dissolved o2 and redox potential are conducive to the anaerobic microbial decomposition of organic matter by methanogens lagomarsino et al 2016b in contrast to cf awd can greatly improve soil aeration and subsequently enhance the soil redox potential fig 4 thus preventing ch4 formation by inhibiting methanogens ma et al 2012 xu et al 2015 moreover awd can also activate the process of ch4 oxidation zhao et al 2019 and decrease the content of soil doc table 5 which is the substrate for methanogenesis peyron et al 2016 and can subsequently reduce ch4 emissions the rapid mineralization of the readily available organic matter pool under oxic conditions might be responsible for the decrease in doc concentration peyron et al 2016 our findings are similar to those of li et al 2005 xu et al 2015 and lagomarsino et al 2016a in terms of rice variety hhz resulted in higher ch4 emissions than 7y88 and 7y370 table 6 it has been reported that ghg emissions vary considerably with the varieties due to the different influence of plants physiology on the o2 transport rate baruah et al 2010 shang et al 2011a the higher yields of 7y88 and 7y370 table 3 may mean that more o2 can be transported to soils by these rice varieties which will subsequently reduce ch4 emissions jiang et al 2016b 2017b moreover lower doc contents under 7y88 and 7y370 cultivation may provide less substrates for methanogens leading to the formation of less ch4 and subsequently reducing ch4 emissions jiang et al 2017a yu et al 2016 jiang et al 2017a 2017b reported lower ch4 emissions from the planting of new rice varieties with higher yields in china it was also found that drought resistant rice hanyou 8 can mitigate ch4 emissions from rice fields in eastern china awd resulted in significantly higher n2o emissions compared with cf in this study table 6 the n2o emissions are negligible due to the fact that the intermediate product n2o of denitrification can be further reduced to n2 under cf when the rice paddies are continuously flooded peng et al 2011 furthermore a high soil water content fig 1 can inhibit the exchange of n2o between the soil and the atmosphere pathak et al 2003 in contrast to cf awd can improve soil aeration and subsequently enhance the soil redox potential fig 3 ma et al 2012 pathak et al 2003 xu et al 2015 and thus n2o is released from the oxygenated soil pores due to enhanced nitrification and incomplete denitrification shang et al 2011b wilson et al 2018 xiong et al 2007 our findings are similar to those of many previous studies liao et al 2020 sibayan et al 2018 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2016 which reported that awd could induce high n2o emissions lower n2o emissions were also observed for 7y88 and 7y370 compared with for hhz in both rice growing seasons table 6 the higher grain yield of drought resistant rice table 2 means that more nitrogen may be assimilated into rice plants the decreased n concentration in the soil under the planting of drought resistant rice table 5 may mean less substrates for nitrification and denitrification said pullicino et al 2016 which may explain the lower n2o emissions measured under the planting of 7y88 and 7y370 rapid uptake of applied n by the crop can strongly limit the availability of mineral n for microbial processes and enhance the crop yields abu hashim et al 2016 moreover similar to ch4 n2o is also transported through aerenchyma cells in submerged soils thus it can be speculated that the diffusion ability of n2o by the two drought resistant rice varieties may be different from that of hhz our results are in agreement with the findings of gorh and baruah 2019 who reported differences in n2o emissions among different rice varieties in this study the closed chamber method was used to determine ghg emissions from paddy fields when assessing irrigation regime and rice variety effects however the potential effects of sampling frequency in time associated with the method should be considered particularly when integrating fluxes to calculate total ghg emissions over the measured periods wood et al 2013 we did not measure frequently n2o fluxes after urea topdressing due to labor shortage which might ignore some emission peaks and result in uncertainties of outcomes nevertheless our results provide an insight into the effects of the agronomic practices on ghg emissions from paddy fields further studies are needed to discuss the effects of sampling frequency on n2o emissions for verifying our results 4 3 effects of irrigation regime and rice variety on gwp and ghgi considering the trade off relationship between n2o and ch4 emissions in rice paddies it is necessary to calculate the gwp to estimate the potential future impacts of n2o and ch4 emissions on the climate system shang et al 2011b in this study awd could effectively mitigate the gwp by 61 6 even if the decrease in ch4 emissions was partially offset by a slight increase in n2o emissions relative to cf the variation of gwp is in line with that of ch4 emissions which accounted for approximately 99 of the total gwp table 6 similar results have been reported by mazza et al 2016 who found that the gwp was lower under awd 30 kpa than under cf during the whole rice growing season ghgi can be used to simultaneously evaluate the gwp and possible economic benefits from crop production meijide et al 2017 awd remarkably increased ghgi by 31 6 on average table 6 while reduced the grain yields at the same time table 3 compared with cf in this study thus it can be speculated that awd may not be an effective irrigation regime for simultaneously maintaining grain yields and mitigating ghg emissions from rice fields the rice varieties showed different impacts on the gwp and ghgi 7y88 and 7y370 exhibited lower gwp and ghgi due to the lower ch4 emissions than hhz in the present study table 6 suggesting that drought resistant rice varieties can effectively mitigate ghg emissions and increase rice yields under awd 5 conclusions in this study awd could significantly save irrigation water and reduce ch4 emissions from rice paddies to mitigate gwp but it caused yield loss at the same time rice variety was found to significantly affect ghg emissions and subsequently influence the gwp 7y88 and 7y370 showed superiority in drought tolerance over hhz as evidenced by their higher yields under awd the rice variety 7y370 showed the lowest ch4 and n2o emissions gwp and ghgi among all varieties regardless of the irrigation regime and thus can be considered as a suitable rice variety for mitigating ghg emissions and increasing rice yields further studies are still needed to develop optimal irrigation regime for saving water and mitigating gwp without reducing the rice yields declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10107,increasing irrigation water scarcity is threatening global rice production and sustainability accordingly the cultivation of drought resistant rice varieties has been strongly advocated to reduce the consumption of irrigation water however it remains unclear how the cultivation of drought resistant rice affects greenhouse gas emissions here a two year field experiment was conducted to elucidate the effects of irrigation regimes awd alternate wetting and drying cf continuous flooding and rice varieties drought resistant rice 7y88 and 7y370 and conventional rice hhz on the grain yields and greenhouse gas methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions from paddy fields the experiment was performed in a split plot design with three replications the results showed that awd significantly reduced water inputs and grain yields compared with cf in both rice growing seasons on average 7y88 and 7y370 significantly enhanced the water use efficiency by 37 6 and 51 5 and the grain yields by 33 9 and 47 0 relative to hhz respectively a trade off between ch4 and n2o emissions was observed under irrigation regimes compared with cf awd significantly reduced cumulative ch4 emissions by 64 9 while increased cumulative n2o emissions by 160 0 and decreased the grain yield by 11 6 on average awd also significantly reduced the global warming potential gwp and greenhouse gas intensity ghgi by 42 2 and 31 6 respectively significant differences p 0 05 in ghg emissions gwp and ghgi were observed between drought resistant rice varieties and hhz the rice variety 7y370 resulted in the lowest ch4 and n2o emissions gwp and ghgi among all varieties under both irrigation regimes these results indicate that the rice variety 7y370 can be recommended to simultaneously mitigate gwp and maintain grain yields keywords alternate wetting and drying drought resistant rice global warming potential greenhouse gas intensity water use efficiency 1 introduction as the staple crop for more

anthropogenic source of greenhouse gas ghg emissions kritee et al 2018 accounting for about 50 of total methane ch4 emissions and 10 of total nitrous oxide n2o emissions from cropland respectively ullah et al 2018 wang et al 2017 china is the largest rice producer in the world and accounts for about 28 1 of the global rice production he et al 2020 water resource shortage has caused great challenges to sustainable rice production in china as a result there have been great changes in irrigation regime in china in recent decades guo and zhou 2007 irrigation regimes such as intermittent irrigation and alternating wetting and drying awd irrigation have been widely used as water saving irrigation techniques xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 previous studies have reported that the optimized irrigation can reduce irrigation water use and promote water productivity compared with the conventional continuous flooding cf irrigation in china jiang et al 2016a thakur et al 2016 for awd irrigation water is supplied when the soil water potential at 15 cm below the soil surface reaches 10 to 30 kpa or when the surface water level declines to 15 cm below the soil surface dang hoa et al 2018 awd irrigation has been reported to contribute to a reduction of 15 20 water use in lowland rice cultivation without causing any yield reduction bhatia et al 2004 besides awd irrigation also has the potential to mitigate greenhouse gas ghg emissions lahue et al 2016 reported 57 78 decreases in annual ch4 emissions from rice fields under awd irrigation hence awd irrigation is becoming increasingly popular in asian countries in the context of increasing irrigation water scarcity for rice production chidthaisong et al 2018 hyun hwoi et al 2017 improvement of rice varieties may also hold great promise for both increasing yield and reducing ghg emissions zhang et al 2019 for example new rice varieties with a higher allocation of photosynthates to the seeds may reduce the allocation of photosynthates belowground for methanogens and are thus conducive to the mitigation of ch4 emissions jiang et al 2017b it has been reported that the application of new varieties is a major approach to increase rice yields accounting for almost 50 of yield growth in all developing countries zhang et al 2019 and the replacement of traditional rice varieties with new varieties in china over the past 50 years has significantly declined area and yield scaled ghg emissions zhang et al 2019 drought resistant rice has been strongly advocated to reduce the consumption of irrigation water for crop production in china yu et al 2016 the rice is bred from a female or male parent with good agronomic characters and a strong tolerance to drought sun et al 2016 yu et al 2016 however few studies investigated the effects of drought resistant rice on ghg emissions gorh and baruah 2019 from past research that had been reviewed it is known that drought resistant rice variety and water saving irrigation could mitigate ghg emissions and their appropriate combination could effectively reduce ghg emissions while maintaining rice yield our aim in this study is to specifically quantify the important results for our given drought resistant rice varieties under the alternative wetting drying irrigation regime here a two year field experiment was designed to evaluate single and interaction effects of irrigation regime and rice variety on the yields and ghg emissions from rice field the results can be important contributions to tackling the climate change phenomenon with its attending targeted zero carbon approach as well as making sustainable rice crop production under a limited water resources regime 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site is

of irrigation water in 2018 and 2019 compared with cf respectively irrigation regime rice variety and study year showed significant effects on grain yields tables 2 and 3 compared with cf awd obviously reduced the rice grain yield by 12 6 on average compared with hhz drought resistant rice varieties 7y88 and 7y370 showed remarkably higher grain yields by 33 9 and 47 0 on average respectively in general rice grain yield was not affected by two way or three way interactions for the components of grain yield awd significantly decreased the number of effective panicles and seed setting rate tables 2 and 4 drought resistant rice varieties 7y88 and 7y370 exhibited a larger number of effective panicles and a higher seed setting rate than hhz different irrigation regimes had no difference in impact on the spikelet number and 1000 grain weight while drought resistant rice showed advantages in spikelet number and 1000 grain weight over hhz study year only showed significant effect on the number of effective panicles there were non significant two way or three way interactions on spikelet number seed setting rate and 1000 grain weight table 2 irrigation regime and study year significantly affected cwp table 2 awd significantly enhanced the cwp by 54 3 relative to cf table 3 cwp was not significantly affected by rice variety moreover there were non significant two way or three way interactions on cwp 3 3 doc no3 and nh4 concentrations the soil doc no3 and nh4 concentrations after harvest varied with irrigation regime rice variety and study year table 5 awd decreased doc and nh4 concentrations by an average of 33 9 and 39 2 respectively and enhanced no3 concentration by 78 05 relative to cf compared with hhz 7y88 and 7y370 significantly decreased the doc no3 and nh4 concentrations by 11 5 21 2 and 12 8 and by 14 8 25 9 and 23 4 on average respectively study year significantly affected doc and nh4 concentrations the interaction of irrigation regime rice variety and study year showed significant effects on the soil no3 and nh4 concentrations 3 4 ch4 and n2o emissions similar ch4 flux patterns were observed among all treatments during the rice growing season of 2018 and 2019 fig 2 peaks of ch4 emissions were observed at the tillering and heading stages moreover the peaks of ch4 emissions reached as high as 58 74 mg m 2 h 1 and 61 85 mg m 2 h 1 for hhz under cf in 2018 and 2019 respectively the fluxes ranged from 1 1 to 58 74 mg m 2 h 1 in 2018 and 1 28 61 85 mg m 2 h 1 in 2019 across all treatments seasonal cumulative ch4 emissions under cf reached a total of 582 7 kg ha 1 on average while those under awd were significantly lower by 64 9 table 6 drought resistant rice varieties showed a mitigating effect on ch4 emissions relative to hhz moreover ch4 emissions were not significantly affected by the two way or three way interactions table 2 n2o flux peaks were observed at the first and second topdressing fig 3 the highest flux was observed for hhz under awd which was 0 61 and 0 68 mg m 2 h 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the n2o fluxes under all treatments ranged from 0 to 0 61 mg m 2 h 1 in 2018 and 0 01 0 68 mg m 2 h 1 in 2019 most of n2o was emitted after the topdressing period in the rice growing season which on average accounted for 60 0 of the total n2o emissions as a whole the seasonal cumulative n2o emissions under awd 18 01 kg ha 1 were significantly increased by 160 6 compared with those under cf drought resistant rice obviously decreased n2o emissions relative to hhz under both awd and cf table 6 moreover n2o emissions were not significantly affected by the two way or three way interactions table 2 3 5 gwp and ghgi both gwp and ghgi were significantly affected by irrigation regime and rice variety table 6 compared with cf awd significantly decreased the gwp and ghgi by 43 1 and 33 2 in 2018 and by 41 2 and 30 0 in 2019 respectively among the rice varieties hhz resulted in the highest gwp over the two years of experiment followed by 7y88 and 7y370 in both seasons the ghgi among different varieties followed the order of hhz 7y88 7y370 in general two way or three way interactions showed no effect on the gwp and ghgi table 2 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation regime and rice variety on rice yield and cwp inconsistent results have been reported about the effect of awd on grain yields some studies have reported decreases in rice grain yields under awd lagomarsino et al 2016a linquist et al 2015 xu et al 2015 whereas in other studies it was found that awd caused no yield reduction belder et al 2005 carrijo et al 2018 dong et al 2011 setyanto et al 2018 yao et al 2012b or even increases in yields liu et al 2013 ullah et al 2018 in this study awd significantly decreased the rice grain yield compared with cf table 3 this discrepancy among studies may be attributed to various factors such as drought degree time of implementation rice variety soil moisture monitoring methods weather and soil hydrological conditions of the experimental site linquist et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 decreases in the yield under awd table 3 might due to the decrease in effective panicles and seed setting rate table 4 drought induced reduction of chlorophyll content and performance of chlorophyll in photosynthesis can decrease the photosynthesis rate shukla et al 2013 which may cause the reduction of crop yields thilakarathne et al 2013 about 12 reduction in yields under awd table 3 is huge for the farmers suggesting that the soil water potential of 30 kpa conducted in this study is too dry for rice growth and thus an optimum threshold level of soil water potential or a safe awd should be adopted to avoid yield losses boumanet al 2007 indicated if the rice field is re irrigated to ensure that the water level is not more than 15 cm below the soil surface termed safe awd rice yields would not be reduced carrijo et al 2017 conducted by a meta analysis to discuss awd effect son rice yields and found that when field water level did not drop below 15 cm from the soil surface or soil water potential was 20 kpa the yields were not significantly reduced in most cases therefore in this study an optimum threshold level of soil water potential under awd 20 kpa or field water level 15 cm might be proposed for maintaining rice yield in this study the yields of hhz 7y88 and 7y370 showed significant differences regardless of irrigation regime table 3 the superiority of the drought resistant rice varieties 7y88 and 7y370 in yields over conventional rice variety hhz under awd may be ascribed to the genetic and physiological factors 7y88 and 7y370 are three line hybrid rice varieties with huhan 7a as the female parent and r370 as the male parent the female parent huhan 7a has good agronomic characters and a strong tolerance to drought yu et al 2016 differences in photosynthetic efficiency among rice varieties may also contribute to differences in yield potential among them under awd gorh and baruah 2019 hence the larger number of effective panicles and spikelets as well as the higher seed setting rate of 7y88 and 7y370 than of hhz table 4 may be ascribed to higher photosynthetic rates irrigation regime was found to significantly affect cwp in this study awd reduced the amount of water consumption by 61 5 and increased the cwp by 53 2 on average relative to cf table 3 which may be due to decreases in seepage percolation and evapotranspiration of water lampayan et al 2014 moreover awd may promote the growth and development of the deeper root system to enhance the tolerance of rice plants to water stress thakur et al 2016 yang et al 2012 awd can also increase the proportion of productive tillers to promote plant growth which indirectly improves the cwp yang and xie 2010 similar results have been reported by previous studies wang et al 2020 xu et al 2015 yang et al 2018 4 2 effects of irrigation regime and rice variety on ch4 and n2o emissions in this study peaks in ch4 fluxes were found at the tillering and heading stages of rice fig 5 which might be due to the enhancement of ch4 transportation through rice plants induced by augmented aerenchyma cells at the tillering stage gupta et al 2002 and increases in ch4 production owing to the increase in c resource table 5 as well as mobilization of more micronutrients for methanogens due to increased root exudation at the heading stage lu et al 2000 n2o flux peaked in the late july and late august under all treatments fig 6 these peaks of n2o emissions could be due to increases in the availability of n for soil microbes from urea topdressing during these periods xu et al 2015 awd was found to dramatically decrease the ch4 emissions in this study table 6 methane is an end product of anaerobic organic matter decomposition conrad 2002 the establishment of strictly anaerobic soil conditions 200 mv is a prerequisite for methanogenic activity pittelkow et al 2013 xu et al 2003 under continuous flooding the decreases in dissolved o2 and redox potential are conducive to the anaerobic microbial decomposition of organic matter by methanogens lagomarsino et al 2016b in contrast to cf awd can greatly improve soil aeration and subsequently enhance the soil redox potential fig 4 thus preventing ch4 formation by inhibiting methanogens ma et al 2012 xu et al 2015 moreover awd can also activate the process of ch4 oxidation zhao et al 2019 and decrease the content of soil doc table 5 which is the substrate for methanogenesis peyron et al 2016 and can subsequently reduce ch4 emissions the rapid mineralization of the readily available organic matter pool under oxic conditions might be responsible for the decrease in doc concentration peyron et al 2016 our findings are similar to those of li et al 2005 xu et al 2015 and lagomarsino et al 2016a in terms of rice variety hhz resulted in higher ch4 emissions than 7y88 and 7y370 table 6 it has been reported that ghg emissions vary considerably with the varieties due to the different influence of plants physiology on the o2 transport rate baruah et al 2010 shang et al 2011a the higher yields of 7y88 and 7y370 table 3 may mean that more o2 can be transported to soils by these rice varieties which will subsequently reduce ch4 emissions jiang et al 2016b 2017b moreover lower doc contents under 7y88 and 7y370 cultivation may provide less substrates for methanogens leading to the formation of less ch4 and subsequently reducing ch4 emissions jiang et al 2017a yu et al 2016 jiang et al 2017a 2017b reported lower ch4 emissions from the planting of new rice varieties with higher yields in china it was also found that drought resistant rice hanyou 8 can mitigate ch4 emissions from rice fields in eastern china awd resulted in significantly higher n2o emissions compared with cf in this study table 6 the n2o emissions are negligible due to the fact that the intermediate product n2o of denitrification can be further reduced to n2 under cf when the rice paddies are continuously flooded peng et al 2011 furthermore a high soil water content fig 1 can inhibit the exchange of n2o between the soil and the atmosphere pathak et al 2003 in contrast to cf awd can improve soil aeration and subsequently enhance the soil redox potential fig 3 ma et al 2012 pathak et al 2003 xu et al 2015 and thus n2o is released from the oxygenated soil pores due to enhanced nitrification and incomplete denitrification shang et al 2011b wilson et al 2018 xiong et al 2007 our findings are similar to those of many previous studies liao et al 2020 sibayan et al 2018 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2016 which reported that awd could induce high n2o emissions lower n2o emissions were also observed for 7y88 and 7y370 compared with for hhz in both rice growing seasons table 6 the higher grain yield of drought resistant rice table 2 means that more nitrogen may be assimilated into rice plants the decreased n concentration in the soil under the planting of drought resistant rice table 5 may mean less substrates for nitrification and denitrification said pullicino et al 2016 which may explain the lower n2o emissions measured under the planting of 7y88 and 7y370 rapid uptake of applied n by the crop can strongly limit the availability of mineral n for microbial processes and enhance the crop yields abu hashim et al 2016 moreover similar to ch4 n2o is also transported through aerenchyma cells in submerged soils thus it can be speculated that the diffusion ability of n2o by the two drought resistant rice varieties may be different from that of hhz our results are in agreement with the findings of gorh and baruah 2019 who reported differences in n2o emissions among different rice varieties in this study the closed chamber method was used to determine ghg emissions from paddy fields when assessing irrigation regime and rice variety effects however the potential effects of sampling frequency in time associated with the method should be considered particularly when integrating fluxes to calculate total ghg emissions over the measured periods wood et al 2013 we did not measure frequently n2o fluxes after urea topdressing due to labor shortage which might ignore some emission peaks and result in uncertainties of outcomes nevertheless our results provide an insight into the effects of the agronomic practices on ghg emissions from paddy fields further studies are needed to discuss the effects of sampling frequency on n2o emissions for verifying our results 4 3 effects of irrigation regime and rice variety on gwp and ghgi considering the trade off relationship between n2o and ch4 emissions in rice paddies it is necessary to calculate the gwp to estimate the potential future impacts of n2o and ch4 emissions on the climate system shang et al 2011b in this study awd could effectively mitigate the gwp by 61 6 even if the decrease in ch4 emissions was partially offset by a slight increase in n2o emissions relative to cf the variation of gwp is in line with that of ch4 emissions which accounted for approximately 99 of the total gwp table 6 similar results have been reported by mazza et al 2016 who found that the gwp was lower under awd 30 kpa than under cf during the whole rice growing season ghgi can be used to simultaneously evaluate the gwp and possible economic benefits from crop production meijide et al 2017 awd remarkably increased ghgi by 31 6 on average table 6 while reduced the grain yields at the same time table 3 compared with cf in this study thus it can be speculated that awd may not be an effective irrigation regime for simultaneously maintaining grain yields and mitigating ghg emissions from rice fields the rice varieties showed different impacts on the gwp and ghgi 7y88 and 7y370 exhibited lower gwp and ghgi due to the lower ch4 emissions than hhz in the present study table 6 suggesting that drought resistant rice varieties can effectively mitigate ghg emissions and increase rice yields under awd 5 conclusions in this study awd could significantly save irrigation water and reduce ch4 emissions from rice paddies to mitigate gwp but it caused yield loss at the same time rice variety was found to significantly affect ghg emissions and subsequently influence the gwp 7y88 and 7y370 showed superiority in drought tolerance over hhz as evidenced by their higher yields under awd the rice variety 7y370 showed the lowest ch4 and n2o emissions gwp and ghgi among all varieties regardless of the irrigation regime and thus can be considered as a suitable rice variety for mitigating ghg emissions and increasing rice yields further studies are still needed to develop optimal irrigation regime for saving water and mitigating gwp without reducing the rice yields declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

ct and 58 higher in nt field based on t than et for a wet period during peak growth due to relatively higher loss of soil e from sparse canopy the results not only illustrated discrepancies in ewue

components separately quantifying the actual seasonal crop water requirement through investigating seasonal variations of t and e is necessary for developing more water efficient management strategies based on better understanding of plant water use and water stress conditions bernacchi and vanloocke 2015 fisher et al 2017 however the continuous measurement and or estimation of t and proportions of

wagle et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 understanding the seasonal dynamics of t or e and t et ratios can be helpful for determining vegetation water requirement and applying appropriate irrigation and other management strategies to minimize e loses and optimize ewue wriedt et al 2009 conventionally water use efficiency wue or crop water productivity is defined as the ratio of grain or biomass yield to amount of precipitation and or irrigation water used kijne et al 2003 viets 1962 and then by using et if available hou et al 2012 zhang et al 2004 this method of determining wue or crop water productivity as the ratio of grain or biomass yield to cumulative et for the entire growing season is not helpful for effective reduction in irrigation water usage additionally this approach does not account for all pools of carbon uptake in ecosystems such as belowground biomass litters or crop residues and carbon in soils vanloocke et al 2012 instead calculation of ewue based on ecosystem level measurements of carbon gain or water loss seems more suitable and applicable for the estimate of ewue for the direct comparison of water use relative to the total carbon gained for forage species and bioenergy feedstocks vanloocke et al 2012 wagle et al 2016a direct measurements of co2 and water vapor h2o fluxes at the ecosystem scale with ec systems make it possible to determine ewue consequently ewue is generally computed as the ratio of carbon uptake either gross primary production gpp to et hu et al 2008 law et al 2002 reichstein et al 2002 wagle et al 2016a or net ecosystem production nep nee net ecosystem co2 change to et at the ecosystem level emmerich 2007 monson et al 2010 wagle et al 2016a 2016b additionally slopes of the regression of hourly or daily or monthly nep or gpp vs et can be used to derive ewue baldocchi et al 2001 emmerich 2007 kuglitsch et al 2008 law et al 2002 wagle et al 2016a however several additional factors such as heterotrophic respiration decomposition of organic materials and e of soil moisture can greatly influence ewue due to complex relationships between carbon gain and water loss at the ecosystem level emmerich 2007 due to a lack of continuous measurement of t at the ecosystem level total et is used as a proxy of t to determine ewue as such actual water use by crops can be overestimated if water resources are managed based on et resulting in low ewue wu et al 2015 the t based ewue as the ratio of gpp to t instead of et gong et al 2017 hu et al 2008 may improve estimates of ewue by accounting for variable amounts of e biederman et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 additionally the physiological interpretation of the ratio of gpp to et or nep to et as ewue can be confounded by ecosystem respiration er and e in this study we partitioned et in

research laboratory el reno oklahoma both fields were planted with winter wheat triticum aestivum l in the previous season both fields were managed under ct management until summer 2015 the ct field was tilled using a tandem disc harrow 12 cm depth to incorporate wheat straw into soils on july 13 and august 12 and to prepare seedbed for planting on september 7 in 2016 the nt field was tilled vertically to 5 cm depth once during seedbed preparation on september 20 2016 to manage excess wheat straw and increase seed to soil contact for better germination canola cv dkw46 16 open pollinated and medium maturity group was planted during october 3 4 2016 at 19 cm row spacing the ct field was harvested on june 15 and the nt field was harvested on june 29 in 2017 crop maturity was delayed due to poor and delayed recovery of canola stands after winter dormancy in nt field as compared to ct field consequently approximately 50 of the grain yield was lost to shattering in ct field due to delayed harvesting caused by rains whereas shattering loss was minimal in nt field as a result harvested grain yield was approximately 0 91 t ha 1 and 0 97 t ha 1 in ct and nt fields respectively

from ct 17 2 ha and nt 20 5 ha canola fields during the 2016 2017 growing season the ec systems included a csat3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc logan ut usa and li 7500 open path infrared gas analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne usa that were mounted at a height of 2 5 m near the center of fields with an adequate fetch length from 100 m to a few hundred meters in all directions the maximum recorded canopy height was 1 1 and 0 9 m in ct and nt fields respectively the sensors were oriented towards prevalent wind direction south west with northward separation of 12 cm eastward separation

between sensors gaps in calculated fluxes were filled and nee data were partitioned into gpp and er using the reddyproc package wutzler et al 2018 we used night time based flux partitioning algorithm to compute night time er as a function of air temperature and extrapolated for daytime reichstein et al 2005 the fluxes were not forced to close the surface energy balance since the mismatch of footprints for available energy i e point measurements near flux towers and sum of turbulent fluxes i e aggregated values for the upwind area can result error in energy balance details on ec instrumentation and data processing can be found in previous publications wagle et al 2018 2019 the sign convention of nee is negative and gpp is positive if the fields are carbon sinks 2 3 landsat

perfect negative correlation of 1 between stomatal fluxes i e t and photosynthesis as t being a water vapor q source and photosynthesis being a carbon dioxide c sink while it predicts a perfect positive correlation of 1 between non stomatal fluxes i e e and respiration as both of them being sources for q and c scanlon and sahu 2008 consequently any deviations of the q c correlation away from the expected 1 are used to determine the relative amounts of stomatal and non stomatal fluxes the fvs method https github com usda ars ussl fluxpart accessed february 21 2020 was employed on high frequency 10 hz ec data collected from november 2016 to may 2017 using fluxpart version 0 2 8 skaggs et al 2018 leaf level wue in the fluxpart was estimated as 3 wue 1 1 6 c a c i q a q i where ca is ambient and ci is intercellular concentration of carbon dioxide and qa is ambient and qi is intercellular concentration of water vapor molecular diffusivities for q and c through stomata correspond to 1 1 6 massman 1998 the ca and qa were derived from above canopy ec tower measurements by extrapolating a logarithmic mean profile with stability corrections to the zero plane displacement height scanlon and kustas 2010 we set qi to 100 relative humidity and leaf temperature to above canopy air temperature in fluxpart skaggs et al 2018 we measured air temperature and relative humidity at 1 8 m height using hmp45c vaisala helsinki finland different parameterizations can be used to estimate ci it can be estimated from a specified constant ppm value 280 ppm for c3 and 130 ppm for c4 crops campbell and norman 2012 or a constant ci ca ratio 0 7 for c3 sinclair et al 1984 and 0 44 for c4 crops kim et al 2006 the ci ca can also be estimated as a linear function of atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd in both c3 and c4 crops morison and gifford 1983 or as a function of square root of vpd ca in c3 crops only katul et al 2009 the ci ca ratio can be estimated based on an optimization model mainly in c3 crops scanlon et al 2019 the constant ci ca ratio is the default model in fluxpart skaggs et al 2018 we used a constant ci ca ratio of 0 7 for canola a c3 crop in this study to produce a successful partitioning solution high frequency ec data for a given time interval must satisfy the following constraints scanlon et al 2019 4a r qc 1 σ c σ q f c f q r qc σ c σ q for r qc 0 4b f c f q r qc σ c σ q for r qc 0 where r qc is the correlation coefficient between q and c σ q is the standard deviation of q σ c is the standard deviation of c and f c and f q 0 are c and q fluxes respectively additionally wue must satisfy an additional constraint of wue f c f q for a physical admissible solution to exist palatella et al 2014 since the fvs method does not always produce successful partitioning solutions due to the above mentioned constraints and there were some differences in the magnitudes for fvs and ec outputs we created half hourly binned diurnal cycles of e and t found with fluxpart for a week to determine weekly t et ratios these t et ratios found with fluxpart were then used to partition daily et values measured by ec to daily values of e and t daily e or t values were summed to determine cumulative values of e or t for any given periods 2 5 ewue calculation the ewue g c mm 1 et or t was calculated at the growing season scale or any other defined periods as a ratio of daytime 7 00 am 7 00 pm local time cumulative values of carbon gain nep or gpp in g c to water loss et or t in mm as follows 5a ewuenep et nep et 5b ewuenep t nep t 5c

nep and gpp from fvs partitioning showed similar diurnal patterns of ec measured derived et nep and gpp fig 1 however peak values of fluxes were slightly smaller for fvs outputs as compared to ec outputs although nep nee and et were directly derived from ec measurements by the fvs method gpp was the partitioned output of the fvs method the ec derived gpp was partitioned from measured nee data using the reddyproc package although we could not validate partitioned t or e due to lack of independent measurements comparable diurnal patterns and magnitudes of gpp from the fvs and reddyproc illustrate the ability of the fvs method to partition eddy fluxes into their component fluxes some discrepancies between fluxes nee and et from fluxpart and eddypro can arise from differences in ec data corrections the eddypro software applies more corrections e g spectral loss density effects instrument separations time lag compensation fratini and mauder 2014 than does fluxpart although fluxpart applies corrections for external fluctuations associated with air temperature and vapor density detto and katul 2007 webb et al 1980 it does not employ other corrections including spectral correction spectral correction is important to correct fluxes for low and high frequency losses in addition the fvs method fails to produce a large number of successful partitioning solutions for the reasons mentioned above 3 2 comparison of crop phenology and fluxes in ct and nt canola fields the month of october was germination and crop establishment period rapid vegetative growth occurred from the beginning of november to late december as shown by the evi fig 2a vegetation growth slowed down and many physical damages occurred during winter resulting in lower evi values crop phenology was similar in both fields until winter however the evi values were substantially lower in nt field during the spring 2017 large differences in evi were observed between ct and nt fields from mid february to mid april i e the period of second round of rapid vegetative growth due to poor post winter recovery with the largest discrepancy noted in mid march i e the evi of 0 67 in ct and 0 29 in nt on march 18 2017 the period of transition from vegetative to reproductive phase flowering began after mid march pods were visible by april 1 and fully expanded by late april farmers in the region have also been observing more winter damage in nt canola fields as winter survival can decrease from 10 to 20 if wheat stubble is not removed or burned rich 2014 rich 2014 also pointed various factors such as seed placement residue thickness crown height of canola plants before winter dormancy and fall soil temperature that can influence winter survival of nt canola planted into wheat stubble additionally poor recovery of crop stands in nt field after winter damage can partly be attributed to lower soil temperatures 3 c less mean soil temperature measured at 2 and 6 cm depths during the growing season and poor drainage 0 4 higher mean relative soil water content measured at 5 cm depth using a hydra probe stevens water monitoring systems inc or usa from mid january through harvesting conditions wagle et al 2019 also note that our point measurements of soil temperature and moisture do not represent poor drainage conditions in micro depressions of nt field during higher rainfall periods the phenology of crop growth was mirrored by seasonality of nep et and t fig 2b d as well as e and er fig s1 monthly values of daytime nep gpp et and t are presented in table 1 vegetation phenology as shown by the evi and fluxes were identical in both fields until winter and large differences in evi and fluxes occurred from february to april due to differences in recovery of canola stands after winter dormancy dry biomass records on april 25 were 0 82 and 0 41 kg m 2 in ct and nt fields respectively larger difference february april in t 21 than et 16 illustrated more evaporative loss of water in nt field due to sparse canopy during the wet spring period however differences in t or et was much smaller than the differences in evi or carbon fluxes 73 and 52 higher nep and gpp respectively in ct field between two fields as the vegetation with dense canopies can have an increased interception pool i e e coming from vegetation whereas sparse canopies can have more e coming from soil i e smaller interception pool both resulting in significant amounts of e during rainy periods under both dense and sparse canopies nelson et al 2020 3 3 seasonality and proportions of t to et the 7 day average daytime t et ratios during the growing season ranged from 0 43 to 0 85 in ct field and from 0 27 to 0 85 in nt field as the ratios were driven by crop growth and soil moisture or rainfall events fig 3 the t et ratios were smaller after rainfall events due to increased e and larger in drier weeks due to reduced e the t et ratios reached to 0 75 0 77 in both fields in mid november as canopy coverage increased then decreased below 0 7 even during the drier weeks of december and january as crop growth slowed down and physical damages occurred i e decreased canopy coverage the t et ratios decreased below 0 5 in the second week of december dormant period of canola growth in both fields after a rainfall event 18 mm the t et ratios increased 0 75 after late january with increased crop growth and canopy coverage the ratios reached 0 8 in both fields during mid march in a dry week the t et ratios of 0 8 were reported for dense maize stand during maturity based on et partitioning zhou et al 2016 and sap flow measurements bethenod et al 2000 several studies have reported an increase in t et ratios as vegetation cover increased ashktorab et al 1994 wagle et al 2020 wang et al 2010 wang and yamanaka 2014 illustrating a strong influence of vegetation cover on t et ratios however factors controlling e also influence t et ratios previous studies have also reported mixed results on the relationships of evi or leaf area index with t et variations ranging from no relationships across biomes fatichi and pappas 2017 to evi or leaf area index explaining approximately from 40 gu et al 2018 wang et al 2014 to 75 zhou et al 2016 2018 of t et variations similarly several studies reported no or little relationships of t et with rainfall or water stress indicators such as wetness index or soil water potential fatichi and pappas 2017 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 we also did not observe a significant relationship of t et ratios with evi and soil water content or rainfall in this study data not shown indicating that t et ratios could be influenced by multiple factors such as soil water availability hydraulic properties of the soil and vegetation type i e phenology root depth these inconsistent results necessitate further investigation for better understanding of the eco hydrological processes involved with t et dynamics an average t et ratio in both fields from mid march to mid may i e reproductive stage from flowering to maturity of pods was 0 74 when rainy days and the following days after rainfall events of 10 mm were excluded seasonal november 2016 may 2017 t et ratios were identical 0 70 in both fields this result was somewhat unexpected considering differences in vegetation phenology between two fields however our results were consistent with the findings of nelson et al 2020 that t et ratios were relatively stable across very different ecosystems similar t et ratios at the seasonal scale for dense and sparse vegetation ecosystems can be attributed to cancel out effects of e from intercepted rainfall by vegetation and soil with regard to discrepancies in vegetation cover good et al 2017 and adaptation of ecosystems to utilize available water resources zhou et al 2016 reported t et ratios of 0 69 for maize 0 62 for soybean glycine max l 0 60 for grasslands 0 56 for evergreen needle leaf forests and 0 52 for deciduous broadleaf forests the growing season average t et ratios for rainfed alfalfa medicago sativa l were 0 82 and 0 77 in a relatively drier year 2016 and relatively wetter year 2017 respectively wagle et al 2020 based on meta analysis of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer et products the average global t et ratio was 0 61 0 15 ranging from 0 51 0 15 in steppes shrub lands and deserts to 0 70 0 14 in tropical rainforests schlesinger and jasechko 2014 mean simulated t et ratio was 0 70 0 09 across biomes fatichi and pappas 2017 3 4 ewuenep and ewuegpp based on et and t 3 4 1 seasonal patterns of ewuenep and ewuegpp seasonality of daytime ewue followed the phenology of crop growth i e dynamics of evi in fig 2a with higher values before and after winter fig 4 due to similar canopies in both fields the difference in ewuegpp et and ewuegpp t was similar 5 difference during the november december period further ewuenep et and ewuenep t were also similar only 7 8 higher in ct than nt field large differences in ewue between two fields were observed mainly from mid february to mid april due to large differences in canopy coverage for that period ewuegpp et and ewuegpp t were 35 and 28 higher respectively in ct 3 92 g c mm 1 et and 5 23 g c mm 1 t than nt field 2 9 g c mm 1 et and 4 07 g c mm 1 t in comparison ewuenep et and ewuenep t for the same period were 60 and 52 higher respectively in ct 2 56 g c mm 1 et and 3 41 g c mm 1 t than nt field 1 6 g c mm 1 et and 2 25 g c mm 1 t these results support the premise that more productive vegetation maximizes the amount of carbon gained per water lost i e higher ewue kuglitsch et al 2008 due to large differences in gain of carbon than loss of water for cancel out effects of e from intercepted rainfall by vegetation and soil with regard to discrepancies in vegetation cover our results also indicate that ewue based on et than t during the periods of higher e can lead to varied magnitudes of differences for cross site comparisons thus partitioning of et or independent measurements of t or e can provide further insights on the coupling between carbon gain nep or gpp and t as e is not directly related to carbon gain via photosynthesis 3 4 2 ewuenep and ewuegpp at the seasonal scale over the main growing season november 2016 may 2017 both daytime ewuegpp et and ewuegpp t were 13 times higher in ct 3 26 g c mm 1 et and 4 56 g c mm 1 t than nt field 2 9 g c mm 1 et and 4 03 g c mm 1 t in comparison both daytime ewuenep et and ewuenep t were 33 times higher in ct 1 88 g c mm 1 et and 2 63 g c mm 1 t than nt field 1 42 g c mm 1 et and 1 98 g c mm 1 t a large difference in ewuenep 33 as compared to ewuegpp 13 between two canola fields at the seasonal scale highlights that large differences can be observed in ewue based on different metrics for cross site comparisons the results indicated that a number of ewue metrics might be needed to systematically compare ewue across sites though previous studies have used various kinds of ewue metrics based on objectives and data availability large differences between ewuenep and ewuegpp in this study were caused by large differences in cumulative nep than gpp between two canola fields when ewuenep and ewuegpp were compared for co located ct and nt winter wheat fields with similar cumulative nep gpp et and canopy stands ewuegpp et was 8 higher and ewuenep et was 13 higher in ct wagle et al 2019 the nep is a more complex process than gpp since nep involves er sum of autotrophic respiration and soil respiration which is not directly coupled to water vapor fluxes like gpp and may obscure the coupling of canopy carbon and water vapor fluxes both physical and biological processes occurring in soils and plants can influence nep more than they influence gpp the availability and quality of substrates and the soil microbial community greatly influence soil respiration monson et al 2006 raich and schlesinger 1992 differences between ewuegpp et and ewuegpp t and between ewuenep et and ewuenep t were 40 in both fields at the seasonal scale as t accounted for 70 of et in both fields due to lack of partitioned et a few previous studies tried to remove the effect of e on calculated ewue at the seasonal scale by excluding ec data for rainy periods and reported no big enough changes in ewue values to compromise cross site comparisons kuglitsch et al 2008 wagle and kakani 2014 note that both carbon gain nep or gpp and water loss et or t data are removed from the calculation of ewue when ec data are excluded for rainy periods which is not similar to the calculation of ewue based on t since e accounted for 30 of et at the growing season scale and 15 20 of et for dry periods during peak growths our study suggests that an assumption of negligible daily e i e t is equivalent to et after a few days of rainfall events seems inadequate as mentioned by nelson et al 2020 consequently calculating ewue based on et and t can cause large discrepancies for cross site comparisons partitioning of et could minimize the bias of cross site comparisons of ewue highlighting the added benefit of t estimates 3 4 3 ewuenep and ewuegpp for short term variation of meteorological conditions we compared ewuenep and ewuegpp based on et and t for a dry march 14 23 2017 cumulative rainfall of 0 mm and wet period march 24 april 2 2017 cumulative rainfall of 61 mm over multiple days during peak growths in ct and nt canola fields in the ct field daytime ewuegpp and ewuenep were 23 higher based on t 5 07 and 3 57 g c mm 1 t respectively than et 4 13 and 2 91 g c mm 1 et respectively for the dry period while they were 36 higher based on t 6 79 and 4 54 g c mm 1 t respectively than et 5 and 3 34 g c mm 1 et respectively for the wet period in the nt field daytime ewuegpp and ewuenep were 26 higher based on t 3 93 and 2 36 g c mm 1 t respectively than et 3 12 and 1 87 g c mm 1 et respectively for the dry period while they were 58 higher based on t 5 36 and 3 25 g c mm 1 t respectively than et 3 4 and 2 06 g c mm 1 et respectively for the wet period results showed that ewuegpp and ewuenep were 23 26 higher based on t than et in both fields for the dry period however ewuegpp and ewuenep were 36 higher in ct and 58 higher in nt field based on t than et for the wet period due to relatively higher loss of soil e from sparse canopy nt field these results further illustrate the added value of t estimates over et for more meaningful ewue estimates under diverse meteorological conditions extension of similar works in other ecosystems and climatic regions can offer further insights on the coupling between carbon gain gpp and nep and water loss et and t and determining the impact of e on estimates and analysis of ewue based on eddy fluxes 3 4 4 relationships of ewuenep and ewuegpp based on et and t and t et ratios with vpd we examined the relationships of daily daytime gpp et gpp t nep et nep t and t et ratios with daily daytime mean vpd for the growing season in ct field fig 5 overall ewue and t et ratios showed more scatter at lower vpd and less scatter with increasing vpd the ewuenep showed less scatter than ewuegpp at lower vpd the t et ratios were smaller at lower vpd and increased with increasing vpd most likely due to relatively higher e for the periods of low vpd i e wet periods after rain or dewfall and smaller e for the periods of higher vpd i e dry periods in comparison ewue values decreased with increasing vpd as water vapor fluxes et or t are less constrained than carbon fluxes nep or gpp by higher vpd through stomatal regulation kuglitsch et al 2008 wagle et al 2016b 4 conclusions the flux variance similarity method was used to partition et into e and t using high frequency 10 hz eddy covariance data collected for the 2016 2017 growing season november 2016 may 2017 from co located rainfed canola fields managed under conventional till ct and no till nt systems canopy stands and fluxes were similar until winter in both fields but were substantially lower under nt during spring 2017 due to poor recovery of crop stands after winter dormancy during wet spring periods larger differences were observed for t than et between ct and nt canola fields due to more evaporative loss in nt field caused by sparse canopy similar to canopy stands large differences in ewue between two fields were observed from february to april at the seasonal scale differences between ewue based on t and et were 40 as t accounted for 70 of et in both fields the results highlighted the added benefit of t estimates to minimize the bias of cross site comparisons of ewue in addition our results suggest that an assumption of negligible daily e i e t is equivalent to et after a few days of

different metrics of carbon gross primary production gpp and net ecosystem production nep and water vapor et and t fluxes in ct and nt canola fields canopy stands fluxes and ewue were similar until winter in both fields but were substantially lower in nt field from february to april due to differences in recovery of canola stands after winter dormancy however differences were much smaller for water loss than carbon gain larger difference was observed for t than et due to significant amounts of e during rainy periods under both dense ct field and sparse nt field canopies the growing season

direct measurement of t at the ecosystem scale et is used as an indicator of crop water requirement during the growing season anapalli et al 2019 ko and piccinni 2009 the eddy covariance ec technique has been increasingly used to continuously measure et and carbon dioxide co2 fluxes at the ecosystem scale in recent decades burba 2019 however ec does not provide direct measurements of e and t components separately quantifying the actual seasonal crop water requirement through investigating seasonal variations of t and e is necessary for developing more water efficient management strategies based on better understanding of plant water use and water stress conditions bernacchi and vanloocke 2015 fisher et al 2017 however the continuous measurement and or estimation of t and proportions of t to et t et is challenging for terrestrial ecosystems kool et al 2014 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 stoy et al 2019 thus partitioning of ec measured et into e and t is needed to assess management strategies and improve ecosystem water use efficiency ewue loss of water by plants in exchange for carbon gain during photosynthesis by reducing non productive loss of water e from agricultural fields wagle et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 understanding the seasonal dynamics of t or e and t et ratios can be helpful for determining vegetation water requirement and applying appropriate irrigation and other management strategies to minimize e loses and optimize ewue wriedt et al 2009 conventionally water use efficiency wue or crop water productivity is defined as the ratio of grain or biomass yield to amount of precipitation and or irrigation water used kijne et al 2003 viets 1962 and then by using et if available hou et al 2012 zhang et al 2004 this method of determining wue or crop water productivity as the ratio of grain or biomass yield to cumulative et for the entire growing season is not helpful for effective reduction in irrigation water usage additionally this approach does not account for all pools of carbon uptake in ecosystems such as belowground biomass litters or crop residues and carbon in soils vanloocke et al 2012 instead calculation of ewue based on ecosystem level measurements of carbon gain or water loss seems more suitable and applicable for the estimate of ewue for the direct comparison of water use relative to the total carbon gained for forage species and bioenergy feedstocks vanloocke et al 2012 wagle et al 2016a direct measurements of co2 and water vapor h2o fluxes at the ecosystem scale with ec systems make it possible to determine ewue consequently ewue is generally computed as the ratio of carbon uptake either gross primary production gpp to et hu et al 2008 law et al 2002 reichstein et al 2002 wagle et al 2016a or net ecosystem production nep nee net ecosystem co2 change to et at the ecosystem level emmerich 2007 monson et al 2010 wagle et al 2016a 2016b additionally slopes of the regression of hourly or daily or monthly nep or gpp vs et can be used to derive ewue baldocchi et al 2001 emmerich 2007 kuglitsch et al 2008 law et al 2002 wagle et al 2016a however several additional factors such as heterotrophic respiration decomposition of organic materials and e of soil moisture can greatly influence ewue due to complex relationships between carbon gain and water loss at the ecosystem level emmerich 2007 due to a lack of continuous measurement of t at the ecosystem level total et is used as a proxy of t to determine ewue as such actual water use by crops can be overestimated if water resources are managed based on et resulting in low ewue wu et al 2015 the t based ewue as the ratio of gpp to t instead of et gong et al 2017 hu et al 2008 may improve estimates of ewue by accounting for variable amounts of e biederman et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 additionally the physiological interpretation of the ratio of gpp to et or nep to et as ewue can be confounded by ecosystem respiration er and e in this study we partitioned et in co located conventional till ct and no till nt rainfed canola brassica napus l fields using the flux variance similarity fvs method which has unique potential for retroactive partitioning of fluxes using existing high frequency i e 10 or 20 hz eddy covariance data records the major objectives of this study were to 1 determine and compare seasonality of t and t et ratios and 2 compare ewue based

research laboratory el reno oklahoma both fields were planted with winter wheat triticum aestivum l in the previous season both fields were managed under ct management until summer 2015 the ct field was tilled using a tandem disc harrow 12 cm depth to incorporate wheat straw into soils on july 13 and august 12 and to prepare seedbed for planting on september 7 in 2016 the nt field was tilled vertically to 5 cm depth once during seedbed preparation on september 20 2016 to manage excess wheat straw and increase seed to soil contact for better germination canola cv dkw46 16 open pollinated and medium maturity group was planted during october 3 4 2016 at 19 cm row spacing the ct field was harvested on june 15 and the nt field was harvested on june 29 in 2017 crop maturity was delayed due to poor and delayed recovery of canola stands after winter dormancy in nt field as compared to ct field consequently approximately 50 of the grain yield was lost to shattering in ct field due to delayed harvesting caused by rains whereas shattering loss was minimal in nt field as a result harvested grain yield was approximately 0 91 t ha 1 and 0 97 t ha 1 in ct and nt fields respectively commonly used practices i e application of fertilizer based on soil tests and application of herbicides pesticides as needed were applied soil type is a complex of renfrow kirkland silt loams bethany

from ct 17 2 ha and nt 20 5 ha canola fields during the 2016 2017 growing season the ec systems included a csat3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc logan ut usa and li 7500 open path infrared gas analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne usa that were mounted at a height of 2 5 m near the center of fields with an adequate fetch length from 100 m to a few hundred meters in all directions the maximum recorded canopy height was 1 1 and 0 9 m in ct and nt fields respectively the sensors were oriented towards prevalent wind direction south west with northward separation of 12 cm eastward separation of 7 cm and no vertical separation high frequency 10 hz raw ec data were processed using the eddypro software li cor inc lincoln ne usa to calculate eddy fluxes at 30 min intervals fluxes with bad quality flags i e quality flag 2 and statistical outliers beyond 3 5 times of standard deviation for a 2 week window were discarded wagle et al 2018 default settings in the eddypro software were used to apply a set of corrections such as the webb pearman leuning term for air density fluctuations webb et al 1980 spectral corrections monin obukhov stability parameter roughness length and time lag between sensors gaps in calculated fluxes were filled and nee data were partitioned into gpp and er using the reddyproc package wutzler et al 2018 we used night time based flux partitioning algorithm to compute night time er as a function of air temperature and extrapolated for daytime reichstein et al 2005 the fluxes were not forced to close the surface energy balance since the mismatch of footprints for available energy i e point measurements near flux towers and sum of turbulent fluxes i e aggregated values for the upwind area can result error in energy balance details on ec instrumentation and data processing can be found in previous publications wagle et al 2018 2019 the sign convention of nee is negative and gpp is positive if the fields are carbon sinks 2 3 landsat

correction coefficients c1 and c2 are 6 and 7 5 respectively and background brightness correction factor l is 1 for landsat 7 data the evi was calculated as 2a evi 2 5 band 4 band 3 band 4 6 band 3 7

perfect negative correlation of 1 between stomatal fluxes i e t and photosynthesis as t being a water vapor q source and photosynthesis being a carbon dioxide c sink while it predicts a perfect positive correlation of 1 between non stomatal fluxes i e e and respiration as both of them being sources for q and c scanlon and sahu 2008 consequently any deviations of the q c correlation away from the expected 1 are used to determine the relative amounts of stomatal and non stomatal fluxes the fvs method https github com usda ars ussl fluxpart accessed february 21 2020 was employed on high frequency 10 hz ec data collected from november 2016 to may 2017 using fluxpart version 0 2 8 skaggs et al 2018 leaf level wue in the fluxpart was estimated as 3 wue 1 1 6 c a c i q a q i where ca is ambient and ci is intercellular concentration of carbon dioxide and qa is ambient and qi is intercellular concentration of water vapor molecular diffusivities for q and c through stomata correspond to 1 1 6 massman 1998 the ca and qa were derived from above canopy ec tower measurements by extrapolating a logarithmic mean profile with stability corrections to the zero plane displacement height scanlon and kustas 2010 we set qi to 100 relative humidity and leaf temperature to above canopy air temperature in fluxpart skaggs et al 2018 we measured air temperature and relative humidity at 1 8 m height using hmp45c vaisala helsinki finland different parameterizations can be used to estimate ci it can be estimated from a specified constant ppm value 280 ppm for c3 and 130 ppm for c4 crops campbell and norman 2012 or a constant ci ca ratio 0 7 for c3 sinclair et al 1984 and 0 44 for c4 crops kim et al 2006 the ci ca can also be estimated as a linear function of atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd in both c3 and c4 crops morison and gifford 1983 or as a function of square root of vpd ca in c3 crops only katul et al 2009 the ci ca ratio can be estimated based on an optimization model mainly in c3 crops scanlon et al 2019 the constant ci ca ratio is the default model in fluxpart skaggs et al 2018 we used a constant ci ca ratio of 0 7 for canola a c3 crop in this study to produce a successful partitioning solution high frequency ec data for a given time interval must satisfy the following constraints scanlon et al 2019 4a r qc 1 σ c σ q f c f q r qc σ c σ q for r qc 0 4b f c f q r qc σ c σ q for r qc 0 where r qc is the correlation coefficient between q and c σ q is the standard deviation of q σ c is the standard deviation of c and f c and f q 0 are c and q fluxes respectively additionally wue must satisfy an additional constraint of wue f c f q for a physical admissible solution to exist palatella et al 2014 since the fvs method does not always produce successful partitioning solutions due to the above mentioned constraints and there were some differences in the magnitudes for fvs and ec outputs we created half hourly binned diurnal cycles of e and t found with fluxpart for a week to determine weekly t et ratios these t et ratios found with fluxpart were then used to partition daily et values measured by ec to daily values of e and t daily e or t values were summed to determine cumulative values of e or t for any given periods 2 5 ewue calculation the ewue g c mm 1 et or t was calculated at the growing season scale or any other defined periods as a ratio of daytime 7 00 am 7 00 pm local time cumulative values of carbon gain nep or gpp in g c to water loss et or t in mm as follows 5a ewuenep et nep et 5b ewuenep t nep t 5c

nep and gpp from fvs partitioning showed similar diurnal patterns of ec measured derived et nep and gpp fig 1 however peak values of fluxes were slightly smaller for fvs outputs as compared to ec outputs although nep nee and et were directly derived from ec measurements by the fvs method gpp was the partitioned output of the fvs method the ec derived gpp was partitioned from measured nee data using the reddyproc package although we could not validate partitioned t or e due to lack of independent measurements comparable diurnal patterns and magnitudes of gpp from the fvs and reddyproc illustrate the ability of the fvs method to partition eddy fluxes into their component fluxes some discrepancies between fluxes nee and et from fluxpart and eddypro can arise from differences in ec data corrections the eddypro software applies more corrections e g spectral loss density effects instrument separations time lag compensation fratini and mauder 2014 than does fluxpart although fluxpart applies corrections for external fluctuations associated with air temperature and vapor density detto and katul 2007 webb et al 1980 it does not employ other corrections including spectral correction spectral correction is important to correct fluxes for low and high frequency losses in addition the fvs method fails to produce a large number of successful partitioning solutions for the reasons mentioned above 3 2 comparison of crop phenology and fluxes in ct and nt canola fields the month of october was germination and crop establishment period rapid vegetative growth occurred from the beginning of november to late december as shown by the evi fig 2a vegetation growth slowed down and many physical damages occurred during winter resulting in lower evi values crop phenology was similar in both fields until winter however the evi values were substantially lower in nt field during the spring 2017 large differences in evi were observed between ct and nt fields from mid february to mid april i e the period of second round of rapid vegetative growth due to poor post winter recovery with the largest discrepancy noted in mid march i e the evi of 0 67 in ct and 0 29 in nt on march 18 2017 the period of transition from vegetative to reproductive phase flowering began after mid march pods were visible by april 1 and fully expanded by late april farmers in the region have also been observing more winter damage in nt canola fields as winter survival can decrease from 10 to 20 if wheat stubble is not removed or burned rich 2014 rich 2014 also pointed various factors such as seed placement residue thickness crown height of canola plants before winter dormancy and fall soil temperature that can influence winter survival of nt canola planted into wheat stubble additionally poor recovery of crop stands in nt field after winter damage can partly be attributed to lower soil temperatures 3 c less mean soil temperature measured at 2 and 6 cm depths during the growing season and poor drainage 0 4 higher mean relative soil water content measured at 5 cm depth using a hydra probe stevens water monitoring systems inc or usa from mid january through harvesting conditions wagle et al 2019 also note that our point measurements of soil temperature and moisture do not represent poor drainage conditions in micro depressions of nt field during higher rainfall periods the phenology of crop growth was mirrored by seasonality of nep et and t fig 2b d as well as e and er fig s1 monthly values of daytime nep gpp et and t are presented in table 1 vegetation phenology as shown by the evi and fluxes were identical in both fields until winter and large differences in evi and fluxes occurred from february to april due to differences in recovery of canola stands after winter dormancy dry biomass records on april 25 were 0 82 and 0 41 kg m 2 in ct and nt fields respectively larger difference february april in t 21 than et 16 illustrated more evaporative loss of water in nt field due to sparse canopy during the wet spring period however differences in t or et was much smaller than the differences in evi or carbon fluxes 73 and 52 higher nep and gpp respectively in ct field between two fields as the vegetation with dense canopies can have an increased interception pool i e e coming from vegetation whereas sparse canopies can have more e coming from soil i e smaller interception pool both resulting in significant amounts of e during rainy periods under both dense and sparse canopies nelson et al 2020 3 3 seasonality and proportions of t to et the 7 day average daytime t et ratios during the growing season ranged from 0 43 to 0 85 in ct field and from 0 27 to 0 85 in nt field as the ratios were driven by crop growth and soil moisture or rainfall events fig 3 the t et ratios were smaller after rainfall events due to increased e and larger in drier weeks due to reduced e the t et ratios reached to 0 75 0 77 in both fields in mid november as canopy coverage increased then decreased below 0 7 even during the drier weeks of december and january as crop growth slowed down and physical damages occurred i e decreased canopy coverage the t et ratios decreased below 0 5 in the second week of december dormant period of canola growth in both fields after a rainfall event 18 mm the t et ratios increased 0 75 after late january with increased crop growth and canopy coverage the ratios reached 0 8 in both fields during mid march in a dry week the t et ratios of 0 8 were reported for dense maize stand during maturity based on et partitioning zhou et al 2016 and sap flow measurements bethenod et al 2000 several studies have reported an increase in t et ratios as vegetation cover increased ashktorab et al 1994 wagle et al 2020 wang et al 2010 wang and yamanaka 2014 illustrating a strong influence of vegetation cover on t et ratios however factors controlling e also influence t et ratios previous studies have also reported mixed results on the relationships of evi or leaf area index with t et variations ranging from no relationships across biomes fatichi and pappas 2017 to evi or leaf area index explaining approximately from 40 gu et al 2018 wang et al 2014 to 75 zhou et al 2016 2018 of t et variations similarly several studies reported no or little relationships of t et with rainfall or water stress indicators such as wetness index or soil water potential fatichi and pappas 2017 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 we also did not observe a significant relationship of t et ratios with evi and soil water content or rainfall in this study data not shown indicating that t et ratios could be influenced by multiple factors such as soil water availability hydraulic properties of the soil and vegetation type i e phenology root depth these inconsistent results necessitate further investigation for better understanding of the eco hydrological processes involved with t et dynamics an average t et ratio in both fields from mid march to mid may i e reproductive stage from flowering to maturity of pods was 0 74 when rainy days and the following days after rainfall events of 10 mm were excluded seasonal november 2016 may 2017 t et ratios were identical 0 70 in both fields this result was somewhat unexpected considering differences in vegetation phenology between two fields however our results were consistent with the findings of nelson et al 2020 that t et ratios were relatively stable across very different ecosystems similar t et ratios at the seasonal scale for dense and sparse vegetation ecosystems can be attributed to cancel out effects of e from intercepted rainfall by vegetation and soil with regard to discrepancies in vegetation cover good et al 2017 and adaptation of ecosystems to utilize available water resources zhou et al 2016 reported t et ratios of 0 69 for maize 0 62 for soybean glycine max l 0 60 for grasslands 0 56 for evergreen needle leaf forests and 0 52 for deciduous broadleaf forests the growing season average t et ratios for rainfed alfalfa medicago sativa l were 0 82 and 0 77 in a relatively drier year 2016 and relatively wetter year 2017 respectively wagle et al 2020 based on meta analysis of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer et products the average global t et ratio was 0 61 0 15 ranging from 0 51 0 15 in steppes shrub lands and deserts to 0 70 0 14 in tropical rainforests schlesinger and jasechko 2014 mean simulated t et ratio was 0 70 0 09 across biomes fatichi and pappas 2017 3 4 ewuenep and ewuegpp based on et and t 3 4 1 seasonal patterns of ewuenep and ewuegpp seasonality of daytime ewue followed the phenology of crop growth i e dynamics of evi in fig 2a with higher values before and after winter fig 4 due to similar canopies in both fields the difference in ewuegpp et and ewuegpp t was similar 5 difference during the november december period further ewuenep et and ewuenep t were also similar only 7 8 higher in ct than nt field large differences in ewue between two fields were observed mainly from mid february to mid april due to large differences in canopy coverage for that period ewuegpp et and ewuegpp t were 35 and 28 higher respectively in ct 3 92 g c mm 1 et and 5 23 g c mm 1 t than nt field 2 9 g c mm 1 et and 4 07 g c mm 1 t in comparison ewuenep et and ewuenep t for the same period were 60 and 52 higher respectively in ct 2 56 g c mm 1 et and 3 41 g c mm 1 t than nt field 1 6 g c mm 1 et and 2 25 g c mm 1 t these results support the premise that more productive vegetation maximizes the amount of carbon gained per water lost i e higher ewue kuglitsch et al 2008 due to large differences in gain of carbon than loss of water for cancel out effects of e from intercepted rainfall by vegetation and soil with regard to discrepancies in vegetation cover our results also indicate that ewue based on et than t during the periods of higher e can lead to varied magnitudes of differences for cross site comparisons thus partitioning of et or independent measurements of t or e can provide further insights on the coupling between carbon gain nep or gpp and t as e is not directly related to carbon gain via photosynthesis 3 4 2 ewuenep and ewuegpp at the seasonal scale over the main growing season november 2016 may 2017 both daytime ewuegpp et and ewuegpp t were 13 times higher in ct 3 26 g c mm 1 et and 4 56 g c mm 1 t than nt field 2 9 g c mm 1 et and 4 03 g c mm 1 t in comparison both daytime ewuenep et and ewuenep t were 33 times higher in ct 1 88 g c mm 1 et and 2 63 g c mm 1 t than nt field 1 42 g c mm 1 et and 1 98 g c mm 1 t a large difference in ewuenep 33 as compared to ewuegpp 13 between two canola fields at the seasonal scale highlights that large differences can be observed in ewue based on different metrics for cross site comparisons the results indicated that a number of ewue metrics might be needed to systematically compare ewue across sites though previous studies have used various kinds of ewue metrics based on objectives and data availability large differences between ewuenep and ewuegpp in this study were caused by large differences in cumulative nep than gpp between two canola fields when ewuenep and ewuegpp were compared for co located ct and nt winter wheat fields with similar cumulative nep gpp et and canopy stands ewuegpp et was 8 higher and ewuenep et was 13 higher in ct wagle et al 2019 the nep is a more complex process than gpp since nep involves er sum of autotrophic respiration and soil respiration which is not directly coupled to water vapor fluxes like gpp and may obscure the coupling of canopy carbon and water vapor fluxes both physical and biological processes occurring in soils and plants can influence nep more than they influence gpp the availability and quality of substrates and the soil microbial community greatly influence soil respiration monson et al 2006 raich and schlesinger 1992 differences between ewuegpp et and ewuegpp t and between ewuenep et and ewuenep t were 40 in both fields at the seasonal scale as t accounted for 70 of et in both fields due to lack of partitioned et a few previous studies tried to remove the effect of e on calculated ewue at the seasonal scale by excluding ec data for rainy periods and reported no big enough changes in ewue values to compromise cross site comparisons kuglitsch et al 2008 wagle and kakani 2014 note that both carbon gain nep or gpp and water loss et or t data are removed from the calculation of ewue when ec data are excluded for rainy periods which is not similar to the calculation of ewue based on t since e accounted for 30 of et at the growing season scale and 15 20 of et for dry periods during peak growths our study suggests that an assumption of negligible daily e i e t is equivalent to et after a few days of rainfall events seems inadequate as mentioned by nelson et al 2020 consequently calculating ewue based on et and t can cause large discrepancies for cross site comparisons partitioning of et could minimize the bias of cross site comparisons of ewue highlighting the added benefit of t estimates 3 4 3 ewuenep and ewuegpp for short term variation of meteorological conditions we compared ewuenep and ewuegpp based on et and t for a dry march 14 23 2017 cumulative rainfall of 0 mm and wet period march 24 april 2 2017 cumulative rainfall of 61 mm over multiple days during peak growths in ct and nt canola fields in the ct field daytime ewuegpp and ewuenep were 23 higher based on t 5 07 and 3 57 g c mm 1 t respectively than et 4 13 and 2 91 g c mm 1 et respectively for the dry period while they were 36 higher based on t 6 79 and 4 54 g c mm 1 t respectively than et 5 and 3 34 g c mm 1 et respectively for the wet period in the nt field daytime ewuegpp and ewuenep were 26 higher based on t 3 93 and 2 36 g c mm 1 t respectively than et 3 12 and 1 87 g c mm 1 et respectively for the dry period while they were 58 higher based on t 5 36 and 3 25 g c mm 1 t respectively than et 3 4 and 2 06 g c mm 1 et respectively for the wet period results showed that ewuegpp and ewuenep were 23 26 higher based on t than et in both fields for the dry period however ewuegpp and ewuenep were 36 higher in ct and 58 higher in nt field based on t than et for the wet period due to relatively higher loss of soil e from sparse canopy nt field these results further illustrate the added value of t estimates over et for more meaningful ewue estimates under diverse meteorological conditions extension of similar works in other ecosystems and climatic regions can offer further insights on the coupling between carbon gain gpp and nep and water loss et and t and determining the impact of e on estimates and analysis of ewue based on eddy fluxes 3 4 4 relationships of ewuenep and ewuegpp based on et and t and t et ratios with vpd we examined the relationships of daily daytime gpp et gpp t nep et nep t and t et ratios with daily daytime mean vpd for the growing season in ct field fig 5 overall ewue and t et ratios showed more scatter at lower vpd and less scatter with increasing vpd the ewuenep showed less scatter than ewuegpp at lower vpd the t et ratios were smaller at lower vpd and increased with increasing vpd most likely due to relatively higher e for the periods of low vpd i e wet periods after rain or dewfall and smaller e for the periods of higher vpd i e dry periods in comparison ewue values decreased with increasing vpd as water vapor fluxes et or t are less constrained than carbon fluxes nep or gpp by higher vpd through stomatal regulation kuglitsch et al 2008 wagle et al 2016b 4 conclusions the flux variance similarity method was used to partition et into e and t using high frequency 10 hz eddy covariance data collected for the 2016 2017 growing season november 2016 may 2017 from co located rainfed canola fields managed under conventional till ct and no till nt systems canopy stands and fluxes were similar until winter in both fields but were substantially lower under nt during spring 2017 due to poor recovery of crop stands after winter dormancy during wet spring periods larger differences were observed for t than et between ct and nt canola fields due to more evaporative loss in nt field caused by sparse canopy similar to canopy stands large differences in ewue between two fields were observed from february to april at the seasonal scale differences between ewue based on t and et were 40 as t accounted for 70 of et in both fields the results highlighted the added benefit of t estimates to minimize the bias of cross site comparisons of ewue in addition our results suggest that an assumption of negligible daily e i e t is equivalent to et after a few days of rainfall events seems inadequate to remove the effect of e on calculated ewue extension of similar works in other ecosystems and climatic regions can offer further insights in the analysis of ewue and

10109,production of vegetables for fresh consumption in arid regions usually takes place in greenhouses with evaporative cooling during the warm months of the year in this period water use for cooling easily exceeds irrigation water use the purpose of this paper is to investigate how far water use for evaporative cooling can be lowered by adapting design elements of the greenhouse and the evaporative cooling system in a greenhouse trial in a desert environment in riyadh ksa two different greenhouses one traditional and one modified both equipped with a pad and fan system have been compared in terms of productivity and water use with main focus on water use for cooling the modified greenhouse design resulted in about 14 higher fresh weight production and more than 40 water saving was achieved on evaporative cooling the climate and water use data recorded during the trial were used to validate a greenhouse climate simulation model including pad and fan cooling then we used the validated model in a scenario study and we quantified the effect of each one of three design elements on use of cooling water it was shown that the extracted air temperature has a major influence on water use for cooling increasing the extracted air temperature with 4 k resulted in about 27 saving in water use for cooling the latter was done by repositioning of the exhaust fans in order to take advantage of the vertical air temperature gradient in the greenhouse additionally a 5 higher cooling efficiency of the pad wall could yield an extra 12 water saving for evaporative cooling finally the greenhouse cover to ground area ratio was also found to affect the water use for cooling in summary we have shown that there is much scope for saving on water use for evaporative cooling by improving design of greenhouses and of the cooling system and that a good greenhouse climate model can be a useful tool in this process the findings of the current research provide clear guidelines for the construction of more water efficient evaporatively cooled greenhouses keywords evaporative cooling water use efficiency greenhouse design pad and fan water saving greenhouse climate simulation 1 introduction fresh vegetable production needs to be increased in the upcoming years to ensure a healthy diet for everybody krishna bahadur et al 2018 although plentiful solar radiation would seem to provide semi arid and arid regions with great potential for agricultural operations it is the high temperature which does not as it typically rises above optimal values this is the case for most of saudi arabia with an average yearly sun radiation sum of 7 6 gj m 2 and mean monthly maximum temperatures between 39 c and 46 c for at least 5 months each year when such values occur relative humidity does not exceed 20 being less than 10 during the day particularly in the central region of the country al helal et al 2004 this is the reason why vegetable production in saudi arabia takes place in greenhouses equipped with evaporative cooling usually pad and fan systems al helal et al 2004 2007 of course the dry climate of the country ensures a large effect under the aforementioned typical weather conditions an evaporative cooling system can reduce the air temperature by more than 20 k while increasing the humidity thus creating a favorable climate for vegetable production evaporative cooling has been shown to deliver conditions more favorable than natural or even forced ventilation also in less dry conditions than deserts for instance the island of cyprus nikolaou et al 2019 however evaporative cooling is attained at the expense of large amounts of water fuchs et al 2006 demonstrated that the amount of water consumed in such systems easily exceeds the water use for irrigation whenever ambient relative humidity is lower than about 50 hence the cooling process is the major component of water use in greenhouses in saudi arabia as well as in other arid or semi arid regions sabeh et al 2011 reported 4 times higher water consumption for evaporative cooling 62 l than for irrigation 15 l per kg of produced tomatoes during their experiment given the fact that water is a scarce and valuable resource in the arid and semi arid regions the importance of water efficient production systems is crucial it is impossible to overstate the importance of efficient water use in saudi arabia a country covered by 95 by desert with an average of 114 mm rainfall per year yearly withdrawals add up to an astounding 1056 of its total renewable water resources napoli et al 2018 with fossil groundwater accounting for the rest the worrying rate of depletion of groundwater resources 88 caused by agriculture was indicated by fao 2017 which observed that the water used in agriculture in 2017 was 3 times more than in 1980 fao 2008 several factors ensure that greenhouses have a higher water use efficiency than open field production stanghellini 2013 scientific research and technological developments during the last years have resulted in new growing techniques and new greenhouse designs that reduce water use katsoulas et al 2015 a closed irrigation loop allows drain re use and it can reduce the use of irrigation water and fertilizers by 20 30 compared to an open irrigation system stanghellini et al 2003 as water use for evaporative cooling is the major component of water use in greenhouses in dry regions research should also focus on reducing water use for cooling carefully maintained pad walls that are not clogged and variable speed fans are reported to reduce the water use for cooling in pad and fan systems al helal et al 2004 2007 kittas et al 2003 sabeh et al 2011 2007 sethi and sharma 2007 however to the knowledge of the authors there is no published scientific research showing a detailed comparison of the effect of different greenhouse designs on water use for evaporative cooling by pad and fan systems in arid regions the current paper evaluates the options for reducing water use of pad and fan cooling systems by improving the design of the greenhouse and the cooling system in particular we focus on means to increase the efficiency of the cooling system by extracting air from the greenhouse at the highest possible temperature and on how both the ratio of cover to ground area and the cooling efficiency of the pad wall affect cooling water use this is done through simulation studies supported by information obtained from greenhouse trials at the national research and development center for sustainable agriculture estidamah in riyadh saudi arabia the estidamah research center a cooperation of the saudi government the company sabic king saud university and wageningen university and research is in operation since late 2016 with the primary goal to carry out research on water saving techniques and greenhouse design adapted to the saudi climate conditions 2 materials and methods the data collected during an experiment in 2 different greenhouse compartments in estidamah were used to validate a greenhouse climate simulation model including pad and fan cooling thereafter we ran a scenario study to predict the effect of three design elements on use of cooling water the elements that were considered are a the exhaust air temperature as a direct result of the positioning of the exhaust fans b the greenhouse cover to ground ratio and c the cooling efficiency of the pad wall 2 1 greenhouse experiment 2 1 1 greenhouses and climate control equipment the experiment was carried out in two different greenhouse compartments in estidamah research center in riyadh 24 7 n 46 7 e the first greenhouse compartment similar to the typical design of the region from now on named lower technology and indicated as l is a single plastic tunnel 40 m 8 m of which 288 m2 is growing area in 5 crop rows gutter height 3 m and total height 5 4 m covered with polyethylene film and equipped with a pad and fan system consisting of a cellulose pad wall 8 m 2 m 15 cm and 3 fans with capacity of 15 000 m3 h 1 each adding up to a total air exchange capacity equal to 140 6 m3 m 2 h 1 equivalent to a maximum of 33 volume exchanges per hour the fans are on off controlled and they can be operated independently from each other two of the three fans are placed 2 m above the ground and the third 1 6 m higher than the other two fig 1a the second greenhouse compartment medium technology and indicated as m is a venlo type greenhouse 40 m 12 m of which 432 m2 is growing area in 8 crop rows gutter height 6 5 m ridge height 7 3 m and span width 4 m covered with standard horticultural tempered glass the greenhouse compartment is part of a bigger greenhouse complex and is equipped with rail pipe heating system high pressure fogging system 0 4 l m 2 h 1 shading screen 50 shading percentage and a pad and fan system consisting of a plastic pad wall 12 m 3 m 15 cm and 6 frequency controlled fans with capacity of 15 000 m3 h 1 each the total air exchange capacity reaches 187 5 m3 m 2 h 1 equivalent to 27 volume exchanges per hour all the fans are placed 5 m above the ground the ground is covered with white reflective plastic foil fig 1c and d the fans in both greenhouses were extracting air that was drawn in through the pad wall at the other end of the greenhouse this depression operation is much more common and usually more efficient than the opposite version the transmissivity of both greenhouses was determined by comparing values of 2 calibrated par sensors one placed at a not shaded place outside the greenhouse and the other moved with constant speed 0 5 m s 1 along the crop lines at the height of the crop wire each sensor was logged every 2 s the average transmissivity of the l greenhouse was 48 whereas transmissivity of the m greenhouse was 62 the higher transmissivity of the m greenhouse in comparison to the l is mainly the result of both different covering material and less construction elements per unit ground area additionally the cover of the m greenhouse was frequently cleaned with a roof washer machine to remove the accumulated dust this operation could not be applied on the cover of the l greenhouse which did enhance the difference in transmissivity between the two greenhouses 2 1 2 the crop the crop was a round tomato solanum lycopersicon l variety tone guitar from seminis for loose harvest the plants were sown on 27th january 2019 transplanted in the greenhouse on 24th february and the first harvest took place on 5th may the experiment was finalized on 23rd december 2019 in both greenhouses the plants were grown on a hydroponic system using stone wool as substrate that allowed drain collection fig 1b and d all plants were grown on a high wire system with a stem density of 5 stems per m2 the marketable weight of each harvest twice a week was recorded for the each greenhouse excluding the side rows 2 1 3 climate and fertigation control the climate and fertigation control as well as the data collection were arranged through a greenhouse process control computer hortimax multima in each greenhouse there were 3 ventilated measuring boxes to record the temperature and humidity values all placed in one middle crop row the first measuring box sensor 1 was placed 5 m away from the pad wall the second measuring box sensor 2 was placed in the middle of the crop row and the third one sensor 3 about 5 m away from the exhaust fans fig 2 all three measuring boxes were maintained at the height of the top of the crop the average of the three measuring boxes was used by the climate computer for control purposes and also in this study as mean greenhouse air temperature the temperature in both greenhouses was maintained between 25 and 28 c during the day and between 18 and 20 c during the night the relative humidity was fluctuating between 65 and 85 during the day depending on the operation of the pad and fan system and the status of the crop the cooling setpoint was set at 26 c during the day and 19 c during the night period with small variations for crop steering purposes fogging in the m greenhouse was used only at the beginning of the growing season to increase humidity during the night the relative humidity was maintained around 75 80 the shading screen in the m greenhouse was only used during the first two months of the trial whenever global radiation exceeded 800 w m 2 the irrigation water including liquid fertilizers was supplied through drip irrigation in both greenhouses the ph and ec of the irrigation and drain as well as the concentration of each individual macro and micro nutrient were monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the crop would not face any deficiency the irrigation supply was based on external sun radiation starting with smaller amounts about 0 5 cc per m2 per joule and increasing gradually to follow the growth of the crop reaching about 3 cc per joule for a fully grown crop the irrigation water for all greenhouses and the water used in the fogging system was treated with a reverse osmosis unit the collected drain from the greenhouses was disinfected uv disinfection unit and reused 2 1 4 calculation of water consumption and water use efficiency the water use wu of the greenhouses was calculated as the water input to the system minus the amount of recovered and re used

the process control computer and all data are recorded digitally with an accuracy of 1 l 2 2 simulation study the dynamic greenhouse climate simulation model kaspro de zwart 1996 was used to compute the water use for the pad and fan cooling system kaspro simulates the greenhouse climate as well as the energy and mass fluxes based on the computation of all relevant heat and mass balances the heat balances include both the convective and radiative processes the mass balances include both exchange processes of gases air water vapor etc and phase changes such as canopy transpiration stanghellini

proportional to the temperature difference δtpf k of the outlet air leaving the greenhouse through the fans tf from the inlet air going in through the pad wall tpw eq 6 5 p cool δ t pf ρ air c v φ 6 δ t pf t f t pw the calculation of the outlet air temperature tf is crucial as it affects the cooling effect and thus the water use of the system given the fact that in greenhouses equipped with pad and fan systems temperature differences are usually observed over the horizontal and vertical direction kittas et al 2003 nikita martzopoulou et al 2008 tf might differ from the average greenhouse air temperature tin the model used in the present study kaspro is a stirred tank model which does not account for spatial temperature differences therefore a correction factor outlet temperature above mean otam k was included in the model and added to the mean greenhouse air temperature tin to account for these spatial temperature differences eq 7 this correction factor is a user input in the present study the value of otam is estimated from in situ measurements see section 2 2 2 below and it is assumed constant 7 t f t in otam 2 2 2 determination of the input parameters for the model validation as the cooling efficiency of the pad wall and the otam are required inputs for the model they were estimated through additional measurements carried out with the use of wireless sensors wireless value bv during one week in july 2019 air temperature was monitored at different heights and locations of the greenhouse fig 2 specifically four sensors were placed a few centimeters in front of the pad wall the average of these four measurements was used as the tpw four sensors were placed in the middle of the greenhouse at the same location where the second measuring box was placed and spread over the vertical direction so that the lowest was about 30 cm above the gutter the next one in the middle of the height of the canopy the third one at the top of the canopy next to the greenhouse measuring box and the highest one 50 cm and 1 m above the top of the crop in the l and m greenhouse respectively the highest sensor measured the temperature at the area above the crop so it was placed higher in the m greenhouse where this area is much larger than in the l finally one sensor was placed in front of each exhaust fan for the determination of the exhaust air temperature tf the average value of in total three sensors in the l greenhouse and six sensors in the m greenhouse was considered as tf the value of otam was calculated based on eq 6 as the difference of tf from greenhouse air temperature tin the latter was the average measured value of the three measuring boxes hanging along one middle crop row at the top of the crop the pad wall cooling efficiency was calculated based on eq 4 where tpw was obtained from the additional measurements described above and tout from the weather station of the greenhouse as both the otam and the pad wall cooling efficiency are constant parameters in the model the average of the values obtained during the analyzed period was finally used as input for the simulations 2 2 3 scenario studies after model validation the simulation study aimed to quantify the effect of three factors related to the greenhouse design and operation namely the otam the greenhouse cover to ground area and the cooling efficiency of the pad wall on the water use by the pad and fan system therefore three groups of scenario simulations were conducted in each group of simulations only the studied factor varied between the simulations and all the other model parameters were not changed as shown in eqs 5 7 the value of otam directly affects the cooling effect of a certain amount of extracted air it can be easily concluded that higher values of otam require less air exchange to obtain a desired cooling effect therefore the amount of incoming air and the water use by the pad wall is reduced the exact effect of otam on water use by the pad and fan system was shown by calculating 25 scenarios of the same cropping season whereby the value of otam was increased from 0 to 12 k with a step of 0 5 k and maintained constant per scenario all the other inputs greenhouse and equipment characteristics climate control setting crop were the same in all scenarios the described scenarios were performed for both the l and m greenhouse in both the measured and simulated data the cooling requirements and the water use are expressed per m2 of greenhouse area taking into account that a greenhouse in the studied weather conditions is heated up via both radiative solar radiation and convective heat transfer between its cover and the usually warmer outside environment the ratio of cover to ground area also affects the amount of energy that has to be extracted per m2 and therefore the water use in practice this means that we expect the cooling requirements per unit ground area of a single tunnel or single span greenhouse to exceed the cooling requirements of a multi tunnel or multi span greenhouse ten simulations for each type of studied greenhouse type l and m were performed were the parameter cover to ground area in the model was adapted to correspond to greenhouses with 1 single to 10 multi tunnels or spans finally the cooling efficiency of the pad wall affects the water use of the cooling system for both greenhouses simulations with cooling efficiencies varying from 0 3 to 1 with a step of 0 05 were performed to quantify the effect of pad wall s cooling efficiency on water use 3 results 3 1 greenhouse climate despite the harsh weather conditions in saudi arabia in both greenhouses the evaporative cooling systems managed to maintain greenhouse air temperature and humidity in the desired range a pad wall can theoretically efficiency 100 according to eq 4 cool the air up to the wet bulb temperature under the dry weather in riyadh area fig 3a the wet bulb temperature was on average 8 k winter to 20 k summer lower than the dry bulb temperature explaining why the pad and fan systems were well capable to maintain the greenhouse air temperature in the desired range up to 14 k lower than outside on average fig 3b air temperature and humidity were for the most time similar in both greenhouses during the early summer period the temperature in the m greenhouse was maintained 0 7 1 k higher than in l fig 3b for crop steering purposes in view of the higher light intensity thanks to the higher transmissivity of the m greenhouse additionally the heating system in the m greenhouse ensured higher night time temperatures during the short cold periods at the beginning and the end of the growing period finally during the same periods natural ventilation was sometimes used instead of evaporative cooling in the m greenhouse resulting in slightly lower humidity in comparison to the l greenhouse which was always cooled with the pad and fan system 3 2 production after a harvesting period of 33 weeks fresh marketable weight of production reached 61 5 kg m 2 and 70 4 kg m 2 in the l and the m greenhouse respectively taking into account that the climate and the fertigation strategy were similar in both greenhouses the difference in production can be well explained by the different amount of light reaching the crop due to the different light transmissivity of the two greenhouses 3 3 water use the measured water use during the cultivation period 24th february 2019 23rd december 2019 is presented in fig 4a total water use in the l greenhouse was 6443 l m 2 whereas it was 4435 l m 2 in the m greenhouse the vast majority of this water 85 and 72 for the l and m greenhouse respectively was devoted to the evaporative cooling and the rest to irrigation the contribution of the fogging system to the water use of the m greenhouse 1 l m 2 was minimal therefore it is hardly visible in fig 4 the water used for irrigation after drain re use in the m greenhouse 1246 l m 2 was about 27 more than the corresponding amount of water used in the l greenhouse 980 l m 2 as a result of both higher production and higher transpiration both initiated by the higher amount of light in the m greenhouse however the water use in the pad wall was 42 lower in the m greenhouse 3190 l m 2 than in the l 5463 l m 2 resulting in more than 30 lower total water use in the m greenhouse as we will see there are three reasons for that difference with the main one being the placement of the fans which are located higher in the m greenhouse and due to the vertical air temperature profile they can extract warmer air fig 5 increasing the cooling capacity of the system additionally the cooling efficiency of the pad wall was found to be higher in the m than in the l greenhouse fig 6 resulting in lower water use finally the cover to greenhouse ground area ratio is higher in the single span l greenhouse about 2 than in the multi span m greenhouse about 1 7 resulting in more heat transfer from the hot outside environment to the greenhouse on a daily basis the contribution of the evaporative cooling in the total water consumption varied through the year based on the weather conditions in particular the daily water use for irrigation varied from 2 l m 2 in the darker period to 5 6 l m 2 in the summer the water used for evaporative cooling varied from no use in winter up to 35 l m 2 and 20 l m 2 in the l and m greenhouse respectively during the summer representing on average about 90 and 80 respectively of the daily total water use during the latter period the product water use pwu reciprocal of water use efficiency fig 4b was calculated as the amount of water required for the production of 1 kg of fresh marketable tomato over the whole growing cycle there was 40 less water spent per kilogram tomato produced in the m greenhouse than in the l as a result of both lower water use and higher production per unit greenhouse area the water used for cooling per kg produced tomato was about half in the m than in the l greenhouse 45 l kg 1 and 89 l kg 1 respectively whereas the water used for irrigation was higher in the m than in the l greenhouse 17 7 l kg 1 and 15 9 l kg 1 respectively mainly as a result of higher transpiration rate 3 4 parametrization and validation of the model in both greenhouses the air temperature increased from the pad wall towards the exhaust fan side and with the height of the greenhouse the exhaust air temperature was found 3 3 k and 9 5 k warmer than the inlet air temperature in the l and m greenhouse respectively in the middle of the greenhouse the air temperature at the top of the crop was on average about 1 k and 2 k warmer than at the bottom of the crop in the l and m greenhouse respectively the temperature increased 1 k more with height in the next 50 cm in the l greenhouse and more than 4 k in the next 1 m in the m greenhouse the average values of otam obtained from the measurements and used in the simulation study were 1 k and 5 k for the l and m greenhouse respectively fig 5 table 1 table 2 using the measured values of tpw tout as measured from the weather station and eq 4 the pad wall efficiencies were calculated fig 6 the estimated pad wall cooling efficiency varied through the day depending on factors such as the air speed through the pad wall and the outside air temperature but for the modeling part of the study a constant value was used the average values of the pad wall cooling efficiency over the whole week 0 8 and 0 85 for the l and the m greenhouse respectively were used as constant input to the model for the whole simulated period these values are in agreement with the measured efficiencies reported by franco et al 2014 for similar air velocities the model predicted with fair accuracy both the greenhouse climate and the water consumed by the cooling system in both greenhouses l and m the simulated greenhouse climate and water consumption showed a close match with the measured data fig 7 proving the validity of the described model for simulations of evaporative cooled greenhouses in arid weather conditions 3 5 scenario studies the first scenario study examined the effect of the outlet air temperature in water consumption fig 8 showing that the water use in the pad and fan system is drastically reduced by increasing outlet air temperature as it is also shown in eq 5 for the same amount of air extracted from the greenhouse the removed sensible heat is proportional to the temperature difference between incoming and extracted air therefore if for example the average greenhouse air temperature is 5 k higher than the temperature of the incoming air from the pad wall then extracting air 5 k warmer than the average greenhouse air results in twice the net cooling effect than extracting air at the average greenhouse air temperature the latter would mean that half the amount of outside air has to pass through the pad wall and be brought in the greenhouse to dissipate the same amount of heat and so half the amount of water is evaporated the design of the m greenhouse takes advantage of the spatial air temperature distribution and by being higher and having the exhaust fans placed high the extracted air is warmer than the average greenhouse air fig 5 table 2 therefore the total amount of air that needs to be extracted from the greenhouse is less in comparison to the l greenhouse where the extracted air is at about the average greenhouse air temperature table 1 as for a given pad wall efficiency the water use is proportional to the amount of air exchange eq 2 the design of the m greenhouse reduces the amount of air extracted from the greenhouse and consequently results in less water use by the pad and fan system according to the simulation results the water use for cooling purposes in the l greenhouse otam equals 1 k would have been almost 25 less if the extracted air was 5 k warmer than the average greenhouse air temperature as in the m greenhouse the larger the cover to ground area ratio is the larger the heat exchange with the outside environment resulting in increased cooling requirements and consequently more water use fig 9 the simulation results showed that the water use for cooling purposes in the l greenhouse would have been about 7 less if the cover to ground ratio was smaller and equal to the corresponding value of the m greenhouse finally the cooling efficiency of the pad wall seriously affects the water use fig 10 as it can also be concluded from the model description according to eq 5 the cooling effect of the pad and fan system for a given amount of air is proportional to the temperature difference between the exhaust and inlet air δτpf if the inlet temperature increases as it happens in case of lower saturation efficiency of the pad wall and assuming that the exhaust temperature is not changing in order to achieve the same cooling effect the amount of air passing through the pad wall increases however the additional air only contributes to the greenhouse cooling as soon as it is colder than the exhaust air temperature the amount of water evaporated to cool the additional air from the outside temperature to the exhaust air temperature increases the total water consumption in case of a pad wall with lower saturation efficiency according to the simulation results a minimum cooling efficiency of 0 6 is required to achieve the desired greenhouse temperature under the studied arid weather conditions therefore results at lower efficiencies are not shown water use reduced with increased efficiency and it was calculated that a pad wall with efficiency higher than 0 9 would use about half of the water used by a pad wall with efficiency equal to 0 6 according to the simulation results the water use by the pad wall of the l greenhouse efficiency equal to 0 8 would have been about 12 less if that pad wall would have had the same efficiency as the one in the m greenhouse 0 85 4 discussion the pad and fan system is the most popular cooling system for greenhouses in saudi arabia as well as in other areas characterized by hot and dry weather al helal et al 2004 sabeh et al 2011 under the weather conditions of riyadh the evaporative cooling in the l and m greenhouses was proven well capable to maintain the greenhouse air temperature and humidity within the target range even when the latter was 20 k less than the outside air temperature under these conditions 1 kg of tomato was produced at the expense of 105 l and 63 l water in the l and m greenhouse respectively the achieved pwu was comparable to the corresponding value 77 kg l 1 reported by sabeh et al 2011 under similar climate conditions in arizona usa and significantly lower than what good commercial growers can achieve in saudi arabia 170 l kg 1 personal communication however it is still far above values reported in the literature from places in the world with less warm weather stanghellini et al 2003 indicating that vegetable production under desert conditions can be very water demanding mainly due to the high needs for evaporative cooling the venlo m greenhouse was proven to be more water efficient than the traditional tunnel l achieving a water saving of 40 per unit of produced product we have shown that three design elements explain this improvement kaspro was validated and proven to predict with fair accuracy the climate and water use in evaporative cooled greenhouses in arid conditions using a time varying value of the input parameter otam could increase even more the accuracy of the computed climate and water use especially the fluctuations between day and night but given the fact that cooling is mainly active during the daytime the variations within a day 24 h are of minor importance the latter was well proven by the agreement between simulated and measured data based on the simulation results fig 8 the placement of the fans that allowed the extraction of air about 5 k above the average greenhouse air temperature resulted in water savings of 55 and 45 compared to the scenarios that in the same greenhouse m the extracted air temperature would be equal to the average greenhouse air temperature or 1 k higher respectively as in the l greenhouse this was achieved by reducing the amount of air extracted from the greenhouse similar water saving can be of course achieved by increasing the height of tunnel greenhouse as soon as this allows the placement of the fans higher and the extraction of warmer air the temperature difference of the exhaust air was responsible for more than half of the water saving in cooling water achieved in the m in comparison to the l greenhouse as soon as this difference was maintained it was calculated that the m greenhouse consumes in all studied scenarios less water for cooling than the l greenhouse even if the cover to ground ratio was increased fig 9 or even if the cooling efficiency of the pad wall was lower fig 10 on the other hand without the advantage of extracting warmer air the more transparent m greenhouse would consume more cooling water than the l greenhouse despite the higher cooling efficiency of the pad wall and the lower cover to ground ratio fig 8 summarizing this indicates a great potential for water saving taking into account that in most commercial greenhouses the fans are located lower than the top of the canopy a more detailed analysis of the spatial air temperature and humidity distribution might help to optimize the position of the exhaust fans and minimize the water use for cooling purposes through a greenhouse design allowing for placement of the fans well above the crop in order to extract air from the warmest spot of the greenhouse while still maintaining optimal growing conditions near the crop it has to be noted that although it was proven that increasing the described temperature gradients results in lower cooling water use an as homogeneous as possible temperature at crop level is desired for uniform crop growth and production ideally the temperature gradients should develop on the vertical direction and above the top of the crop so that the growth and production is not hampered furthermore it was shown that the slightly higher cooling efficiency of the pad wall contributed for about 16 additional decrease in cooling water use in the m greenhouse comparing scenarios for the m greenhouse with cooling efficiencies of 0 8 and 0 85 fig 10 the effect of pad wall cooling efficiency on the amount of evaporated water is reported in scientific literature abdel wahab 1994 kubota et al 2006 according to the simulation results fig 10 increasing the pad wall cooling efficiency from 0 8 to 0 85 reduces the water use for cooling by about 12 16 when on the contrary reducing it from 0 8 to 0 75 increases the water use by 8 10 the aforementioned results represent a rather conservative estimation of the effect of the increasing pad wall efficiency on water saving as the exhaust air temperature is considered not changed increasing the pad wall cooling efficiency reduces the required amount of extracted air to achieve a specific cooling effect and consequently reduces water consumption as explained in the case of otam in reality if the fans are frequency controlled reducing the pad wall s saturation efficiency will increase the fan speed in order to meet the increased requirement of air exchange resulting in lower horizontal temperature differences and thus lower exhaust air temperature kubota et al 2006 as explained in this paper the latter will increase water use even more in the described experiment the higher pad wall efficiency in the m compared to the l greenhouse was achieved thanks to three factors i lower air velocities through the pad walls are reported to increase saturation efficiency al helal 2007 franco et al 2014 kubota et al 2006 the speed of the air drawn in through the pad walls was not measured but given the dimensions of the pad walls and the capacities of the fans it was about 0 8 m s 1 in the l greenhouse when all three fans were in operation and it could reach a maximum of about 0 7 m s 1 in the m greenhouse when the fans were operated at their maximum capacity however the frequency controlled fans of the m greenhouse were not operated at their maximum speed so the actual wind speed through the pad wall was even lower the bigger pad wall surface per ground area at the m than in the l greenhouse the pad wall in the m greenhouse is 1 m higher than in the l when the length of both greenhouses is the same ensured that more air volume per greenhouse ground area could enter the greenhouse at lower wind speeds and definitely contributed to the achieved higher cooling efficiency abdel wahab 1994 already 25 years ago during their research in saudi arabia indicated the controllable ventilation rate as a solution that reduces water use in a pad and fan system and increases the energy and water use efficiency of the system ii plastic pad walls like the one used in the m greenhouse are reported to achieve higher saturation efficiencies than cellulose pad walls franco et al 2014 iii plastic pad walls like the one used in the m greenhouse can be easily cleaned with high pressure water preventing clogging that reduces the saturation efficiency al helal et al 2004 5 conclusion evaporative cooling is by far the largest water use in the greenhouses where it is applied in the present research it is proven that there is a great potential in water saving by modifying the design of greenhouses with evaporative cooling in arid areas we have experimentally shown that greenhouse design can significantly reduce product water use of tomato in desert conditions we have used such experimental data to validate a simulation model whereby we have shown that a the extracted air temperature which is directly related to the placement of the exhaust fans has a major effect on water demand for cooling b the pad wall saturation efficiency has also a major effect on water use and c that greenhouse complexes with lower cover to ground ratio result in less cooling requirements per unit ground area than small units with higher cover to ground ratio declaration of competing interest the

like to thank the national research and development center for sustainable agriculture estidamah riyadh saudi arabia for supporting this work financially the presented research would have never been completed without the motivation and the hard work of the operation team at estidamah research center who perfectly executed the research plan and ensured the smooth function of the greenhouse and of the control equipment 
10109,production of vegetables for fresh consumption in arid regions usually takes place in greenhouses with evaporative cooling during the warm months of the year in this period water use for cooling easily exceeds irrigation water use the purpose of this paper is to investigate how far water use for evaporative cooling can be lowered by adapting design elements of the greenhouse and the evaporative cooling system in a greenhouse trial in a desert environment in riyadh ksa two different greenhouses one traditional and one modified both equipped with a pad and fan system have been compared in terms of productivity and water use with main focus on water use for cooling the modified greenhouse design resulted in about 14 higher fresh weight production and more than 40 water saving was achieved on evaporative cooling the climate and water use data recorded during the trial were used to validate a greenhouse climate simulation model including pad and fan cooling then we used the validated model in a scenario study and we quantified the effect of each one of three design elements on use of cooling water it was shown that the extracted air temperature has a major influence on water use for cooling increasing the extracted air temperature with 4 k resulted in about 27 saving in water use for cooling the latter was done by repositioning of the exhaust fans in order to take advantage of the vertical air temperature gradient in the greenhouse additionally a 5 higher cooling efficiency of the pad wall could yield an extra 12 water saving for evaporative cooling finally the greenhouse cover to ground area ratio was also found to affect the water use for cooling in summary we have shown that there is much scope for saving on water use for evaporative cooling by improving design of greenhouses and of the cooling system and that a good greenhouse climate model can be a useful tool in this process the findings of the current research provide clear guidelines for the construction of more water efficient evaporatively cooled greenhouses keywords evaporative cooling water use efficiency greenhouse design pad and fan water saving greenhouse climate simulation 1 introduction fresh vegetable production needs to be increased in the upcoming years to ensure a healthy diet for everybody krishna bahadur et al 2018 although plentiful solar radiation would seem to provide semi arid and arid regions with great potential for agricultural operations it is the high temperature which does not as it typically rises above optimal values this is the case for most of saudi arabia with an average yearly sun radiation sum of 7 6 gj m 2 and mean monthly maximum temperatures between 39 c and 46 c for at least 5 months each year when such values occur relative humidity does not exceed 20 being less than 10 during the day particularly in the central region of the country al helal et al 2004 this is the reason why vegetable production in saudi arabia takes place in greenhouses equipped with evaporative cooling usually pad and fan systems al helal et al 2004 2007 of course the dry climate of the country ensures a large effect under the aforementioned typical weather conditions an evaporative cooling system can reduce the air temperature by more than 20 k while increasing the humidity thus creating a favorable climate for vegetable production evaporative cooling has been shown to deliver conditions more favorable than natural or even forced ventilation also in less dry conditions than deserts for instance the island of cyprus nikolaou et al 2019 however evaporative cooling is attained at the expense of large amounts of water fuchs et al 2006 demonstrated that the amount of water consumed in such systems easily exceeds the water use for irrigation whenever ambient relative humidity is lower than about 50 hence the cooling process is the major component of water use in greenhouses in saudi arabia as well as in other arid or semi arid regions sabeh et al 2011 reported 4 times higher water consumption for evaporative cooling 62 l than for irrigation 15 l per kg of produced tomatoes during their experiment given the fact that water is a scarce and valuable resource in the arid and semi arid regions the importance of water efficient production systems is crucial it is impossible to overstate the importance of efficient water use in saudi arabia a country covered by 95 by desert with an average of 114 mm rainfall per year yearly withdrawals add up to an astounding 1056 of its total renewable water resources napoli et al 2018 with fossil groundwater accounting for the rest the worrying rate of depletion of groundwater resources 88 caused by agriculture was indicated by fao 2017 which observed that the water used in agriculture in 2017 was 3 times more than in 1980 fao 2008 several factors ensure that greenhouses have a higher water use efficiency than open field production stanghellini 2013 scientific research and technological developments during the last years have resulted in new growing techniques and new greenhouse designs that reduce water use katsoulas et al 2015 a closed irrigation loop allows drain re use and it can reduce the use of irrigation water and fertilizers by 20 30 compared to an open irrigation system stanghellini et al 2003 as water use for evaporative cooling is the major component of water use in greenhouses in dry regions research should also focus on reducing water use for cooling carefully maintained pad walls that are not clogged and variable speed fans are reported to reduce the water use for cooling in pad and fan systems al helal et al 2004 2007 kittas et al 2003 sabeh et al 2011 2007 sethi and sharma 2007 however to the knowledge of the authors there is no published scientific research showing a detailed comparison of the effect of different greenhouse designs on water use for evaporative cooling by pad and fan systems in arid regions the current paper evaluates the options for reducing water use of pad and fan cooling systems by improving the design of the greenhouse and the cooling system in particular we focus on means to increase the efficiency of the cooling system by extracting air from the greenhouse at the highest possible temperature and on how both the ratio of cover to ground area and the cooling efficiency of the pad wall affect cooling water use this is done through simulation studies supported by information obtained from greenhouse trials at the national research and development center for sustainable agriculture estidamah in riyadh saudi arabia the estidamah research center a cooperation of the saudi government the company sabic king saud university and wageningen university and research is in operation since late 2016 with the primary goal to carry out research on water saving techniques and greenhouse design adapted to the saudi climate conditions 2 materials and methods the data collected during an experiment in 2 different greenhouse compartments in estidamah were used to validate a greenhouse climate simulation model including pad and fan cooling thereafter we ran a scenario study to predict the effect of three design elements on use of cooling water the elements that were considered are a the exhaust air temperature as a direct result of the positioning of the exhaust fans b the greenhouse cover to ground ratio and c the cooling efficiency of the pad wall 2 1 greenhouse experiment 2 1 1 greenhouses and climate control equipment the experiment was carried out in two different greenhouse compartments in estidamah research center in riyadh 24 7 n 46 7 e the first greenhouse compartment similar to the typical design of the region from now on named lower technology and indicated as l is a single plastic tunnel 40 m 8 m of which 288 m2 is growing area in 5 crop rows gutter height 3 m and total height 5 4 m covered with polyethylene film and equipped with a pad and fan system consisting of a cellulose pad wall 8 m 2 m 15 cm and 3 fans with capacity of 15 000 m3 h 1 each adding up to a total air exchange capacity equal to 140 6 m3 m 2 h 1 equivalent to a maximum of 33 volume exchanges per hour the fans are on off controlled and they can be operated independently from each other two of the three fans are placed 2 m above the ground and the third 1 6 m higher than the other two fig 1a the second greenhouse compartment medium technology and indicated as m is a venlo type greenhouse 40 m 12 m of which 432 m2 is growing area in 8 crop rows gutter height 6 5 m ridge height 7 3 m and span width 4 m covered with standard horticultural tempered glass the greenhouse compartment is part of a bigger greenhouse complex and is equipped with rail pipe heating system high pressure fogging system 0 4 l m 2 h 1 shading screen 50 shading percentage and a pad and fan system consisting of a plastic pad wall 12 m 3 m 15 cm and 6 frequency controlled fans with capacity of 15 000 m3 h 1 each the total air exchange capacity reaches 187 5 m3 m 2 h 1 equivalent to 27 volume exchanges per hour all the fans are placed 5 m above the ground the ground is covered with white reflective plastic foil fig 1c and d the fans in both greenhouses were extracting air that was drawn in through the pad wall at the other end of the greenhouse this depression operation is much more common and usually more efficient than the opposite version the transmissivity of both greenhouses was determined by comparing values of 2 calibrated par sensors one placed at a not shaded place outside the greenhouse and the other moved with constant speed 0 5 m s 1 along the crop lines at the height of the crop wire each sensor was logged every 2 s the average transmissivity of the l greenhouse was 48 whereas transmissivity of the m greenhouse was 62 the higher transmissivity of the m greenhouse in comparison to the l is mainly the result of both different covering material and less construction elements per unit ground area additionally the cover of the m greenhouse was frequently cleaned with a roof washer machine to remove the accumulated dust this operation could not be applied on the cover of the l greenhouse which did enhance the difference in transmissivity between the two greenhouses 2 1 2 the crop the crop was a round tomato solanum lycopersicon l variety tone guitar from seminis for loose harvest the plants were sown on 27th january 2019 transplanted in the greenhouse on 24th february and the first harvest took place on 5th may the experiment was finalized on 23rd december 2019 in both greenhouses the plants were grown on a hydroponic system using stone wool as substrate that allowed drain collection fig 1b and d all plants were grown on a high wire system with a stem density of 5 stems per m2 the marketable weight of each harvest twice a week was recorded for the each greenhouse excluding the side rows 2 1 3 climate and fertigation control the climate and fertigation control as well as the data collection were arranged through a greenhouse process control computer hortimax multima in each greenhouse there were 3 ventilated measuring boxes to record the temperature and humidity values all placed in one middle crop row the first measuring box sensor 1 was placed 5 m away from the pad wall the second measuring box sensor 2 was placed in the middle of the crop row and the third one sensor 3 about 5 m away from the exhaust fans fig 2 all three measuring boxes were maintained at the height of the top of the crop the average of the three measuring boxes was used by the climate computer for control purposes and also in this study as mean greenhouse air temperature the temperature in both greenhouses was maintained between 25 and 28 c during the day and between 18 and 20 c during the night the relative humidity was fluctuating between 65 and 85 during the day depending on the operation of the pad and fan system and the status of the crop the cooling setpoint was set at 26 c during the day and 19 c during the night period with small variations for crop steering purposes fogging in the m greenhouse was used only at the beginning of the growing season to increase humidity during the night the relative humidity was maintained around 75 80 the shading screen in the m greenhouse was only used during the first two months of the trial whenever global radiation exceeded 800 w m 2 the irrigation water including liquid fertilizers was supplied through drip irrigation in both greenhouses the ph and ec of the irrigation and drain as well as the concentration of each individual macro and micro nutrient were monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the crop would not face any deficiency the irrigation supply was based on external sun radiation starting with smaller amounts about 0 5 cc per m2 per joule and increasing gradually to follow the growth of the crop reaching about 3 cc per joule for a fully grown crop the irrigation water for all greenhouses and the water used in the fogging system was treated with a reverse osmosis unit the collected drain from the greenhouses was disinfected uv disinfection unit and reused 2 1 4 calculation of water consumption and water use efficiency the water use wu of the greenhouses was calculated as the water input to the system minus the amount of recovered and re used

the water use for the pad and fan cooling system kaspro simulates the greenhouse climate as well as the energy and mass fluxes based on the computation of all relevant heat and mass balances the heat balances include both the convective and radiative processes the mass balances include both exchange processes of gases air water vapor etc and phase changes such as canopy transpiration stanghellini

fan systems temperature differences are usually observed over the horizontal and vertical direction kittas et al 2003 nikita martzopoulou et al 2008 tf might differ from the average greenhouse air temperature tin the model used in the present study kaspro is a stirred tank model which does not account for spatial temperature differences therefore a correction factor outlet temperature above mean otam k was included in the model and added to the mean greenhouse air temperature tin to account for these spatial temperature differences eq 7 this correction factor is a user input in the present study the value of otam is estimated from in situ measurements see section 2 2 2 below and it is assumed constant 7 t f t in otam 2 2 2 determination of the input parameters for the model validation as the cooling efficiency of the pad wall and the otam are required inputs for the model they were estimated through additional measurements carried out with the use of wireless sensors wireless value bv during one week in july 2019 air temperature was monitored at different heights and locations of the greenhouse fig 2 specifically four sensors were placed a few centimeters in front of the pad wall the average of these four measurements was used as the tpw four sensors were placed in the middle of the greenhouse at the same location where the second measuring box was placed and spread over the vertical direction so that the lowest was about 30 cm above the gutter the next one in the middle of the height of the canopy the third one at the top of the canopy next to the greenhouse measuring box and the highest one 50 cm and 1 m above the top of the crop in the l and m greenhouse respectively the highest sensor measured the temperature at the area above the crop so it was placed higher in the m greenhouse where this area is much larger than in the l finally one sensor was placed in front of each exhaust fan for the determination of the exhaust air temperature tf the average value of in total three sensors in the l greenhouse and six sensors in the m greenhouse was considered as tf the value of otam was calculated based on eq 6 as the difference of tf from greenhouse air temperature tin the latter was the average measured value of the three measuring boxes hanging along one middle crop row at the top of the crop the pad wall cooling efficiency was calculated based on eq 4 where tpw was obtained from the additional measurements described above and tout from the weather station of the greenhouse as both the otam and the pad wall cooling efficiency are constant parameters in the model the average of the values obtained during the analyzed period was finally used as input for the simulations 2 2 3 scenario studies after model validation the simulation study aimed to quantify the effect of three factors related to the greenhouse design and operation namely the otam the greenhouse cover to ground area and the cooling efficiency of the pad wall on the water use by the pad and fan system therefore three groups of scenario simulations were conducted in each group of simulations only the studied factor varied between the simulations and all the other model parameters were not changed as shown in eqs 5 7 the value of otam directly affects the cooling effect of a certain amount of extracted air it can be easily concluded that higher values of otam require less air exchange to obtain a desired cooling effect therefore the amount of incoming air and the water use by the pad wall is reduced the exact effect of otam on water use by the pad and fan system was shown by calculating 25 scenarios of the same cropping season whereby the value of otam was increased from 0 to 12 k with a step of 0 5 k and maintained constant per scenario all the other inputs greenhouse and equipment characteristics climate control setting crop were the same in all scenarios the described scenarios were performed for both the l and m greenhouse in both the measured and simulated data the cooling requirements and the water use are expressed per m2 of greenhouse area taking into account that a greenhouse in the studied weather conditions is heated up via both radiative solar radiation and convective heat transfer between its cover and the usually warmer outside environment the ratio of cover to ground area also affects the amount of energy that has to be extracted per m2 and therefore the water use in practice this means that we expect the cooling requirements per unit ground area of a single tunnel or single span greenhouse to exceed the cooling requirements of a multi tunnel or multi span greenhouse ten simulations for each type of studied greenhouse type l and m were performed were the parameter cover to ground area in the model was adapted to correspond to greenhouses with 1 single to 10 multi tunnels or spans finally the cooling efficiency of the pad wall affects the water use of the cooling system for both greenhouses simulations with cooling efficiencies varying from 0 3 to 1 with a step of 0 05 were performed to quantify the effect of pad wall s cooling efficiency on water use 3 results 3 1 greenhouse climate despite the harsh weather conditions in saudi arabia in both greenhouses the evaporative cooling systems managed to maintain greenhouse air temperature and humidity in the desired range a pad wall can theoretically efficiency 100 according to eq 4 cool the air up to the wet bulb temperature under the dry weather in riyadh area fig 3a the wet bulb temperature was on average 8 k winter to 20 k summer lower than the dry bulb temperature explaining why the pad and fan systems were well capable to maintain the greenhouse air temperature in the desired range up to 14 k lower than outside on average fig 3b air temperature and humidity were for the most time similar in both greenhouses during the early summer period the temperature in the m greenhouse was maintained 0 7 1 k higher than in l fig 3b for crop steering purposes in view of the higher light intensity thanks to the higher transmissivity of the m greenhouse additionally the heating system in the m greenhouse ensured higher night time temperatures during the short cold periods at the beginning and the end of the growing period finally during the same periods natural ventilation was sometimes used instead of evaporative cooling in the m greenhouse resulting in slightly lower humidity in comparison to the l greenhouse which was always cooled with the pad and fan system 3 2 production after a harvesting period of 33 weeks fresh marketable weight of production reached 61 5 kg m 2 and 70 4 kg m 2 in the l and the m greenhouse respectively taking into account that the climate and the fertigation strategy were similar in both greenhouses the difference in production can be well explained by the different amount of light reaching the crop due to the different light transmissivity of the two greenhouses 3 3 water use the measured water use during the cultivation period 24th february 2019 23rd december 2019 is presented in fig 4a total water use in the l greenhouse was 6443 l m 2 whereas it was 4435 l m 2 in the m greenhouse the vast majority of this water 85 and 72 for the l and m greenhouse respectively was devoted to the evaporative cooling and the rest to irrigation the contribution of the fogging system to the water use of the m greenhouse 1 l m 2 was minimal therefore it is hardly visible in fig 4 the water used for irrigation after drain re use in the m greenhouse 1246 l m 2 was about 27 more than the corresponding amount of water used in the l greenhouse 980 l m 2 as a result of both higher production and higher transpiration both initiated by the higher amount of light in the m greenhouse however the water use in the pad wall was 42 lower in the m greenhouse 3190 l m 2 than in the l 5463 l m 2 resulting in more than 30 lower total water use in the m greenhouse as we will see there are three reasons for that difference with the main one being the placement of the fans which are located higher in the m greenhouse and due to the vertical air temperature profile they can extract warmer air fig 5 increasing the cooling capacity of the system additionally the cooling efficiency of the pad wall was found to be higher in the m than in the l greenhouse fig 6 resulting in lower water use finally the cover to greenhouse ground area ratio is higher in the single span l greenhouse about 2 than in the multi span m greenhouse about 1 7 resulting in more heat transfer from the hot outside environment to the greenhouse on a daily basis the contribution of the evaporative cooling in the total water consumption varied through the year based on the weather conditions in particular the daily water use for irrigation varied from 2 l m 2 in the darker period to 5 6 l m 2 in the summer the water used for evaporative cooling varied from no use in winter up to 35 l m 2 and 20 l m 2 in the l and m greenhouse respectively during the summer representing on average about 90 and 80 respectively of the daily total water use during the latter period the product water use pwu reciprocal of water use efficiency fig 4b was calculated as the amount of water required for the production of 1 kg of fresh marketable tomato over the whole growing cycle there was 40 less water spent per kilogram tomato produced in the m greenhouse than in the l as a result of both lower water use and higher production per unit greenhouse area the water used for cooling per kg produced tomato was about half in the m than in the l greenhouse 45 l kg 1 and 89 l kg 1 respectively whereas the water used for irrigation was higher in the m than in the l greenhouse 17 7 l kg 1 and 15 9 l kg 1 respectively mainly as a result of higher transpiration rate 3 4 parametrization and validation of the model in both greenhouses the air temperature increased from the pad wall towards the exhaust fan side and with the height of the greenhouse the exhaust air temperature was found 3 3 k and 9 5 k warmer than the inlet air temperature in the l and m greenhouse respectively in the middle of the greenhouse the air temperature at the top of the crop was on average about 1 k and 2 k warmer than at the bottom of the crop in the l and m greenhouse respectively the temperature increased 1 k more with height in the next 50 cm in the l greenhouse and more than 4 k in the next 1 m in the m greenhouse the average values of otam obtained from the measurements and used in the simulation study were 1 k and 5 k for the l and m greenhouse respectively fig 5 table 1 table 2 using the measured values of tpw tout as measured from the weather station and eq 4 the pad wall efficiencies were calculated fig 6 the estimated pad wall cooling efficiency varied through the day depending on factors such as the air speed through the pad wall and the outside air temperature but for the modeling part of the study a constant value was used the average values of the pad wall cooling efficiency over the whole week 0 8 and 0 85 for the l and the m greenhouse respectively were used as constant input to the model for the whole simulated period these values are in agreement with the measured efficiencies reported by franco et al 2014 for similar air velocities the model predicted with fair accuracy both the greenhouse climate and the water consumed by the cooling system in both greenhouses l and m the simulated greenhouse climate and water consumption showed a close match with the measured data fig 7 proving the validity of the described model for simulations of evaporative cooled greenhouses in arid weather conditions 3 5 scenario studies the first scenario study examined the effect of the outlet air temperature in water consumption fig 8 showing that the water use in the pad and fan system is drastically reduced by increasing outlet air temperature as it is also shown in eq 5 for the same amount of air extracted from the greenhouse the removed sensible heat is proportional to the temperature difference between incoming and extracted air therefore if for example the average greenhouse air temperature is 5 k higher than the temperature of the incoming air from the pad wall then extracting air 5 k warmer than the average greenhouse air results in twice the net cooling effect than extracting air at the average greenhouse air temperature the latter would mean that half the amount of outside air has to pass through the pad wall and be brought in the greenhouse to dissipate the same amount of heat and so half the amount of water is evaporated the design of the m greenhouse takes advantage of the spatial air temperature distribution and by being higher and having the exhaust fans placed high the extracted air is warmer than the average greenhouse air fig 5 table 2 therefore the total amount of air that needs to be extracted from the greenhouse is less in comparison to the l greenhouse where the extracted air is at about the average greenhouse air temperature table 1 as for a given pad wall efficiency the water use is proportional to the amount of air exchange eq 2 the design of the m greenhouse reduces the amount of air extracted from the greenhouse and consequently results in less water use by the pad and fan system according to the simulation results the water use for cooling purposes in the l greenhouse otam equals 1 k would have been almost 25 less if the extracted air was 5 k warmer than the average greenhouse air temperature as in the m greenhouse the larger the cover to ground area ratio is the larger the heat exchange with the outside environment resulting in increased cooling requirements and consequently more water use fig 9 the simulation results showed that the water use for cooling purposes in the l greenhouse would have been about 7 less if the cover to ground ratio was smaller and equal to the corresponding value of the m greenhouse finally the cooling efficiency of the pad wall seriously affects the water use fig 10 as it can also be concluded from the model description according to eq 5 the cooling effect of the pad and fan system for a given amount of air is proportional to the temperature difference between the exhaust and inlet air δτpf if the inlet temperature increases as it happens in case of lower saturation efficiency of the pad wall and assuming that the exhaust temperature is not changing in order to achieve the same cooling effect the amount of air passing through the pad wall increases however the additional air only contributes to the greenhouse cooling as soon as it is colder than the exhaust air temperature the amount of water evaporated to cool the additional air from the outside temperature to the exhaust air temperature increases the total water consumption in case of a pad wall with lower saturation efficiency according to the simulation results a minimum cooling efficiency of 0 6 is required to achieve the desired greenhouse temperature under the studied arid weather conditions therefore results at lower efficiencies are not shown water use reduced with increased efficiency and it was calculated that a pad wall with efficiency higher than 0 9 would use about half of the water used by a pad wall with efficiency equal to 0 6 according to the simulation results the water use by the pad wall of the l greenhouse efficiency equal to 0 8 would have been about 12 less if that pad wall would have had the same efficiency as the one in the m greenhouse 0 85 4 discussion the pad and fan system is the most popular cooling system for greenhouses in saudi arabia as well as in other areas characterized by hot and dry weather al helal et al 2004 sabeh et al 2011 under the weather conditions of riyadh the evaporative cooling in the l and m greenhouses was proven well capable to maintain the greenhouse air temperature and humidity within the target range even when the latter was 20 k less than the outside air temperature under these conditions 1 kg of tomato was produced at the expense of 105 l and 63 l water in the l and m greenhouse respectively the achieved pwu was comparable to the corresponding value 77 kg l 1 reported by sabeh et al 2011 under similar climate conditions in arizona usa and significantly lower than what good commercial growers can achieve in saudi arabia 170 l kg 1 personal communication however it is still far above values reported in the literature from places in the world with less warm weather stanghellini et al 2003 indicating that vegetable production under desert conditions can be very water demanding mainly due to the high needs for evaporative cooling the venlo m greenhouse was proven to be more water efficient than the traditional tunnel l achieving a water saving of 40 per unit of produced product we have shown that three design elements explain this improvement kaspro was validated and proven to predict with fair accuracy the climate and water use in evaporative cooled greenhouses in arid conditions using a time varying value of the input parameter otam could increase even more the accuracy of the computed climate and water use especially the fluctuations between day and night but given the fact that cooling is mainly active during the daytime the variations within a day 24 h are of minor importance the latter was well proven by the agreement between simulated and measured data based on the simulation results fig 8 the placement of the fans that allowed the extraction of air about 5 k above the average greenhouse air temperature resulted in water savings of 55 and 45 compared to the scenarios that in the same greenhouse m the extracted air temperature would be equal to the average greenhouse air temperature or 1 k higher respectively as in the l greenhouse this was achieved by reducing the amount of air extracted from the greenhouse similar water saving can be of course achieved by increasing the height of tunnel greenhouse as soon as this allows the placement of the fans higher and the extraction of warmer air the temperature difference of the exhaust air was responsible for more than half of the water saving in cooling water achieved in the m in comparison to the l greenhouse as soon as this difference was maintained it was calculated that the m greenhouse consumes in all studied scenarios less water for cooling than the l greenhouse even if the cover to ground ratio was increased fig 9 or even if the cooling efficiency of the pad wall was lower fig 10 on the other hand without the advantage of extracting warmer air the more transparent m greenhouse would consume more cooling water than the l greenhouse despite the higher cooling efficiency of the pad wall and the lower cover to ground ratio fig 8 summarizing this indicates a great potential for water saving taking into account that in most commercial greenhouses the fans are located lower than the top of the canopy a more detailed analysis of the spatial air temperature and humidity distribution might help to optimize the position of the exhaust fans and minimize the water use for cooling purposes through a greenhouse design allowing for placement of the fans well above the crop in order to extract air from the warmest spot of the greenhouse while still maintaining optimal growing conditions near the crop it has to be noted that although it was proven that increasing the described temperature gradients results in lower cooling water use an as homogeneous as possible temperature at crop level is desired for uniform crop growth and production ideally the temperature gradients should develop on the vertical direction and above the top of the crop so that the growth and production is not hampered furthermore it was shown that the slightly higher cooling efficiency of the pad wall contributed for about 16 additional decrease in cooling water use in the m greenhouse comparing scenarios for the m greenhouse with cooling efficiencies of 0 8 and 0 85 fig 10 the effect of pad wall cooling efficiency on the amount of evaporated water is reported in scientific literature abdel wahab 1994 kubota et al 2006 according to the simulation results fig 10 increasing the pad wall cooling efficiency from 0 8 to 0 85 reduces the water use for cooling by about 12 16 when on the contrary reducing it from 0 8 to 0 75 increases the water use by 8 10 the aforementioned results represent a rather conservative estimation of the effect of the increasing pad wall efficiency on water saving as the exhaust air temperature is considered not changed increasing the pad wall cooling efficiency reduces the required amount of extracted air to achieve a specific cooling effect and consequently reduces water consumption as explained in the case of otam in reality if the fans are frequency controlled reducing the pad wall s saturation efficiency will increase the fan speed in order to meet the increased requirement of air exchange resulting in lower horizontal temperature differences and thus lower exhaust air temperature kubota et al 2006 as explained in this paper the latter will increase water use even more in the described experiment the higher pad wall efficiency in the m compared to the l greenhouse was achieved thanks to three factors i lower air velocities through the pad walls are reported to increase saturation efficiency al helal 2007 franco et al 2014 kubota et al 2006 the speed of the air drawn in through the pad walls was not measured but given the dimensions of the pad walls and the capacities of the fans it was about 0 8 m s 1 in the l greenhouse when all three fans were in operation and it could reach a maximum of about 0 7 m s 1 in the m greenhouse when the fans were operated at their maximum capacity however the frequency controlled fans of the m greenhouse were not operated at their maximum speed so the actual wind speed through the pad wall was even lower the bigger pad wall surface per ground area at the m than in the l greenhouse the pad wall in the m greenhouse is 1 m higher than in the l when the length of both greenhouses is the same ensured that more air volume per greenhouse ground area could enter the greenhouse at lower wind speeds and definitely contributed to the achieved higher cooling efficiency abdel wahab 1994 already 25 years ago during their research in saudi arabia indicated the controllable ventilation rate as a solution that reduces water use in a pad and fan system and increases the energy and water use efficiency of the system ii plastic pad walls like the one used in the m greenhouse are reported to achieve higher saturation efficiencies than cellulose pad walls franco et al 2014 iii plastic pad walls like the one used in the m greenhouse can be easily cleaned with high pressure water preventing clogging that reduces the saturation efficiency al helal et al 2004 5 conclusion evaporative cooling is by far the largest water use in the greenhouses where it is applied in the present research it is proven that there is a great potential in water saving by modifying the design of greenhouses with evaporative cooling in arid areas we have experimentally shown that greenhouse design can significantly reduce product water use of tomato in desert conditions we have used such experimental data to validate a simulation model whereby we have shown that a the extracted air temperature which is directly related to the placement of the exhaust fans has a major effect on water demand for cooling b the pad wall saturation efficiency has also a major effect on water use and c that
