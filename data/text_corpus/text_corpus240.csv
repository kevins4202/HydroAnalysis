1200,seawater intrusion has become a common problem in coastal and island aquifers with the rise in climate change that greatly affects the majority of developing countries the island hydrology is very complex and associated with a unique set of environmental characteristics with the dynamic interaction of groundwater surface water and seawater further sea level rise erratic rainfall and over extraction of groundwater triggered salt water intrusion a study on seawater intrusion and the effect of limestone caves on groundwater was carried out in middle andaman using a combination of ionic ratios of major ions a total of 24 samples and a reference sample from the sea were collected and analysed using icp spectrophotometer and flame photometer a combination of 10 ionic ratios cl hco3 ca hco3 so4 ca mg cl ca mg ca na cl so4 hco3 ca so4 k cl mg cl and so4 cl was used to assess the dissolution of limestone minerals and the level of saltwater intrusion into groundwater the geospatial method was used to extract and combine all the hydrogeochemical parameters and ionic ratios in the gis platform durov plot was used for the interpretation of groundwater chemistry and the identification of natural processes controlling the hydrogeochemistry of the area the dominance of ca hco3 and na hco3 was confirmed in 48 and 24 of the sample respectively the equiline graph of chloride with other major ions showed the enrichment of alkali and alkaline earth metal salt in groundwater schoeller s diagram depicted the dominance of cl ca and the sum of co3 and hco3 in seawater near mayabunder the lower concentration of na with respect to cl 64 and ca 100 showed the presence of a reverse ion exchange process further the correlation matrix showed a strong relationship between cl k ca and na the analysis of x ray diffraction of the rock samples confirmed the presence of limestones such as aragonite calcite chlorite chromite dolomite magnetite and pyrite in the study area the integration of ionic ratios showed moderately affected and slightly affected saline regions in 44 and 54 of the region respectively finally the role of tectonic activities and active lineaments connected to the sea was found to play a major role in the intrusion of seawater where interconnected faults created an opening for surface water to recharge groundwater leading to the deep aquifer keywords limestone caves seawater intrusion hydrogeochemical investigation middle andaman ionic ratios data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is a prominent source of water for drinking domestic irrigation and industrial usage in villages and cities in major countries adimalla et al 2020 gill et al 2017 subramani et al 2005 the quantity and quality of groundwater are two significant aspects that sustain life on earth the insufficient availability of surface water to meet the increased water requirement has led to more dependency on groundwater to fulfil the demand for potable water supply therefore quality of groundwater quality has become an important concern in many parts of the country the source of groundwater contamination is mainly through interaction with minerals atmospheric precipitation recharging water quality along with anthropogenic pollution coming from domestic agricultural and industrial activities li et al 2021 selvakumar et al 2017 tamta 2003 srivastava et al 2012 seawater intrusion is one of the most common and widespread sources of groundwater contamination in islands and coastal region of the world akshitha et al 2021 naily 2018 abdalla et al 2015 ahmed et al 2013 allow 2012 abdollahi nasab et al 2010 lee and song 2007 post 2005 chidambaram et al 2014 the identification and assessment of seawater intrusion are very important for the prevention and mitigation of contamination in aquifers the seawater intrusion of an aquifer in island areas is a product of multiple salination processes with different sources of water climate change such as erratic rainfall accelerated sea level rise and the over extraction of groundwater increases the lateral movement of seawater into groundwater werner 2010 dragoni and sukhija 2008 natural occurring rocks containing minerals like halite and anthropogenic effluents from households agriculture and industries are other possible causes of groundwater contamination rena et al 2022 singh et al 2018 rajkumar et al 2010 milnes 2011 jones et al 1999 custodio 2010 the interaction of island aquifer with seawater is associated with several processes such as mineral dissolution or precipitation of salt s reverse ion exchange and the reduction of sulphate which indicate the intensity of salinization in groundwater rani et al 2021 sakram et al 2013 elango and kannan 2007 appelo and postma 2005 the groundwater intrusion is further controlled by several parameters like the difference in the rate of recharge and rate of discharge of freshwater in the aquifer distance from the shoreline hydraulic conductivity aquifer depth and the confining units in the aquifer which prevents the movement of saltwater vertically upward or inside the aquifer saidi et al 2013 barlow and reichard 2010 the groundwater quality can be deteriorated by mixing only 2 of saltwater studies have shown that 4 of mixing can lead to significant impairment of groundwater quality causing adverse environmental conditions if the mixing of saltwater increases to 6 it becomes unsuitable for human consumption but can be used by some industries srinivasamoorthy et al 2013 mondal et al 2011 custodio 2010 darnault and godinez 2008 since seawater intrusion is so complex and geochemically connected it further requires a combination of indicators to study its occurrences in the islands bhagat et al 2021 sajil kumar 2016 kazakis et al 2016 rajmohan and elango 2004 seawater intrusion has been investigated or monitored using approaches like geophysical geochemistry and groundwater flow models age transport pathways and seawater wedge theory can be identified through isotopes and water chemistry mohanty and rao 2019 ganyaglo et al 2017 werner and simmons 2009 vengosh 2003 louvat et al 1999 naidu et al 2013 since these above stated studies are very costly the study of ratios of major ion concentration is the only feasible way for saline water delineation studies have shown that freshwater has a dominance of major ions such as calcium magnesium bicarbonates sulphates chloride sodium and potassium while seawater majorly contains chloride and sodium ions only thus intrusion of seawater inland aquifers may be detected by analyzing the increase in these ions in the aquifers srinivasamoorthy et al 2013 mondal et al 2011 todd and mays 2004 bear et al 1999 the concentration of these ions changes from the recharging area to discharging area of aquifers connected to the sea and the ionic ratios of major ions change at the interaction of groundwater and seawater through ion exchange processes and oxidation reduction reactions naily 2018 marimuthu et al 2005 stoessell 1997 gimenez and morell 1997 as a result a lot of ionic ratios have been proposed to identify salinization in coastal areas such as na cl ca mg ca na and cl hco₃ so₄ asare et al 2021 carol and kruse 2012 marimuthu et al 2005 lee and song 2007 panno et al 2006 gimenez and morell 1997 vengosh 2003 the change in the ratio of the molar concentration of ions associated with seawater intrusion may give dissimilar results therefore an integration of their result is used to arrive at a consistent decision the current research has also included the hydrogeological assessment of aquifer spatial and statistical analysis of ionic ratios correlation analysis of major ions major hydro chemical processes x ray diffraction of rocks and finally inter correlation of seawater intrusion with active faults and groundwater level of middle andaman 1 1 study area middle andaman is part of the andaman and nicobar group of islands system in the southeast part of the indian subcontinent the study area is a part of the andaman series that lies between north andaman and south andaman connected through national highway nh 223 the geographical extent of middle andaman is 12 24 19 984 e to 12 55 38 788 e latitude and 92 48 15 417 n to 92 58 49 854 n longitude fig 1 most of the region 80 comprises a range of open to dense forests the forest of the region is classified as moist deciduous and tropical evergreen forest the vegetation of the andaman islands is similar to malaysian islands and burmese islands in comparison to the mainland of the indian subcontinent the biota species of the region belong to marine habitats the island s beaches are the nesting sites of sea snakes and sea turtles ganeshaiah et al 2019 rao 1996 1 2 geology of the area middle andaman is part of the outer arc of the arakan yoma range that formed the main chain of andaman and nicobar islands it is made of sedimentary rocks mainly from marine deposits singha et al 2019 kumar 1981 jafri et al 1993 srinivasan 1979 limestone caves are formed in lithified rocks of aggerated particulate matter sankaran 1998 the location of caves is controlled either by the source of sediments or their transformation into rocks gulam rasool et al 2022 ford and cullingford 1976 most limestone caves are formed by either underground drainage erosion or sea cliffs or sea erosion of rocks challinor 1967 out of 384 caves found on the island 61 5 are inland and 38 5 are sea shore among inland caves 86 are underground 1 are at the origin of streams and the rest are above the ground either on inland cliffs or inland hills they have very fragile ecosystems their fauna is too sensitive to humidity temperature and light fig 2 the study area lies in earthquake and tsunami prone areas which causes occasional damage to these caves the impact on caves was first documented in 2004 earthquakes in both middle andaman and north andaman it caused structural changes such as opening closing partial closing narrowing or widening of many existing caves it was found that more damage had happened to caves that were above the ground than the caves below the ground manchi and sankaran 2009 the limestone in shallow water was found to be associated with the mithakhari mélange group of the paleocene eocene age mélange itself is self explanatory in indicating that there was a mixing of the lithological units due to tectonic activities these mélanges when deposited as unconformity forms a suitable formation for groundwater exploration mithakari or baratang formation has two other members of the rock chain called tugapur limestone berma dera and karmatang sandstone limestones i e lensoid and folded structures are in contact with sandstone units between rangat and mayabandar of middle andaman berma dera sector has an area of 4000 m2 and a reservoir of approximately 10 000 tons per meter depth of limestone whereas the tugapur sector has approximately 8500 tons per meter depth in a surface area of 3000 m2 in the buddha nala a reservoir of approximately 12 000 tons per meter depth of limestone is present on the surface of 5000 m2 bandopadhyay and carter 2017 1 3 hydrology map of the area island receives abundant rainfall of approx 3000 mm per annum but the undulating terrain with steep slopes porous soil stratum and its proximity to the sea leads to a loss of 75 of the annual rainfall also the abundance of sedimentary rocks 70 and the presence of clay minerals contribute to the unfavourable condition for rainfall percolation to sub surface water fig 3 therefore we are getting aquifers unsuitable for groundwater storage in both shallow and deep horizons on the contrary the presence of 15 coral rags or limestone formation and the remaining 15 of igneous rocks provide favourable conditions for a sustainable aquifer in the region mukherjee 1986 bandopadhyay and carter 2017 the ophiolite rocks of igneous origin intruded in sandstone formation have higher aerial fracture density than sedimentary rocks the fracture density has greater control over drainage density for groundwater development and is associated with the presence of good aquifers the weathered sandstone rocks may also be a source of water but of low transmissivity roy et al 2005 2 methodology and data analyses 2 1 groundwater sampling groundwater sampling points have been chosen based on surface manifestation from satellite images as well as the accessibility of the groundwater site a total of 25 samples were collected from different parts of middle andaman of which 24 samples were from groundwater and one sample from seawater as a reference most of the samples were collected from an open well except one sample from spring water sample no 11 the samples were collected in polypropylene plastic bottles for cation and anion analysis separately the bottles were rinsed from the sampling water at least three times before the collection of samples also precautions were taken to minimize the impact of the material of the pipe and biases on the representative sample the groundwater samples were geolocated using garmin gps global positioning system the parameters like ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were recorded using handheld probes the water samples collected for cations were preserved by adding a few drops of concentrated hno3 and stored at a cool temperature 4 c further samples were filtered through 0 45 m pore filter paper before analysis 2 2 groundwater parameter analysis major anions and major cations analysis were done in the laboratory using standard methods given by the american public health association apha 2005 and diatloff and rengel 2001 sodium potassium and calcium were measured using the elico flame photometer elico cl 378 and magnesium was measured using icp oes agilent 5110 major anions such as carbonate bicarbonate and chloride were analysed by using the titrimetric method whereas nitrate phosphate and sulphate were analysed using uv vis spectrophotometer perkin elmer lambda 35 with tri method malachite green method and barium sulphate method respectively apha 2005 ph ec and tds were measured on the sampling site using a probe multiparameter test 35 series the accuracy of groundwater parameters was calculated using charge balance error cbe it assumes the neutrality of charge in natural water domenico and schwartz 1997 cbe c a c a where c and a are the sums of cations and anions meq l respectively the value of charge balance error cbe was found in the range of 5 in all the water samples the average minimum maximum and standard deviation of cbe of all the samples was found to be 0 02 0 42 0 24 and 0 19 respectively as all the samples were within the acceptable limit water parameters were assumed to be good for further analysis firstly major cations and major anions were converted from mg l to meq l to remove the effect of charge in the calculation a total of ten ionic ratios were taken to estimate the seawater intrusion in the study area klassen and allen 2017 lee and song 2007 bear et al 1999 nadler et al 1980 rosenthal 1988 these groundwater chemical ionic ratios were found to be na cl na ca mg cl ca mg cl so₄ hco₃ k cl so₄ cl cl hco₃ ca mg cl and ca hco₃ so₄ further the base exchange index bex was calculated to distinguish the undergoing process of salination or recharging freshening stuyfzand 2008 a positive value of bex indicates refreshing water a negative value represents salination and a zero value means the absence of base exchange bex na k mg 1 0716 cl meq l the equiline graph is generated using ms excel 2019 whereas durov and schoeller s diagram was plotted using aqqa version 1 1 1 the earthquake data was taken from the usgs earth explorer from 1990 to 2022 with a richter scale of 5 arcgis 10 8 was used for generating the spatial map of ionic ratios using the inverse distance weightage method idw further maps were integrated using the spatial overlay technique 3 result and discussion 3 1 evaluation of water quality parameters table 1 is a summary of the water quality parameters meq l comprised of the minimum maximum mean median and standard deviation of the major ions it was observed that the electrical conductivity value of water samples varied from 100 μs cm to 1500 μs cm with an average value of 548 μs cm 60 of samples were found above 500 μs cm chloride concentration varied between 0 98 meq l to 270 55 meq l with an average value of 12 47 meq l cl and ec are two parameters that are universally accepted indicators of seawater intrusion the high value of cl and ec is indicative of seawater intrusion in our study area a high value of chloride and ec were found in the samples taken near the coast chloride is the single parameter found in seawater due to its conservative nature it shares 55 of tds in seawater and that makes it a very sensitive indicator of contamination of seawater in groundwater nadler et al 1980 moujabber et al 2006 jones et al 1999 panno et al 2006 it was found that the water sample taken from the sea near mayabunder jatti sample no 25 also shown in fig 4 had a high concentration of calcium 175 12 meq l sodium 87 45 meq l potassium 5 01 meq l chloride 270 meq l and sulphate 0 09 meq l 3 2 schoeller diagram in addition to the summarised data table 1 the schoeller diagram illustrated the relative concentrations meq l of major ions in each sample it allowed to accommodate a large number of chemical constituents for comparison and investigation as per fig 4 the pattern of ions obtained from different sources of groundwater indicated that the seawater sample sea1 showed the dominance of chloride and calcium ions while the lower concentration of sodium with respect to chloride and calcium ions showed the presence of reverse ion exchange governing between sodium from seawater and calcium from limestone minerals it was also found that bicarbonate has a higher value in all the samples except seawater whereas calcium was found dominant in all the samples including seawater the chloride value meq l was found higher value than sodium in 76 of the samples the loss of sodium ions is probably due to the replacement of the sodium ion exchange process in groundwater we may infer the possibility of seawater intrusion in the area 3 3 equiline graphs of chloride with major ions the concentrations of chloride were plotted against the major ions na ca mg k so4 no3 hco3 and ec fig 5 and the least r square value of linear regression was determined stoessell 1997 explained the good linear coefficient of determination between the cl and major ions like na ca and k showed a possible mixing of freshwater with single brine chemistry the intrusion of seawater provided the replacement of sodium with the same milliequivalent concentration of calcium and carbonate with chloride fig 5a f similarly the analysis of seawater depicted a higher concentration of potassium and chloride indicating the seawater influence in the aquifers the equiline graphs fig 5a d c of potassium calcium and sodium showed a strong relation with chloride possibly due to the interaction of seawater with limestone and aquifers of the island on the other hand the equiline graph between ec and chloride did not show any linear correlation with each other the dominance of ec over chloride and equal concentration meq l of sodium and chloride suggested enrichment evaporation nacl aerosol or direct mixing of seawater the dominance of bicarbonate over chloride shows the weathering of carbonate minerals from limestone deposition in the study area the dominance of chloride over nitrate and sulphate wipes out the possibility of anthropogenic influence in the aquifer the highest value shown in the graph is the seawater sample from the coast of mayabunder in the middle andaman umarani et al 2019 lakshmanan et al 2003 3 4 spatial map of ionic ratio the summarised table of the mean minimum maximum and standard deviation of the ionic ratios is shown in table 2 equiline graphs and schoeller showed that seawater intrusion is the major cause of low groundwater quality in most of the island s aquifers the salinity caused by seawater intrusion has been associated with a lower value of sodium than chloride in groundwater compared to seawater vengosh 2003 in the case of saltwater intrusion the ratio of na cl declines in saline groundwater and that is lower than that of marine water 0 86 schoeller 1967 this is because when seawater intrudes into groundwater a chemical exchange process takes place between rocks and seawater mercado 1985 nadler et al 1980 and calcium ions replace sodium ions resulting in depletion in sodium ion concentration but no change in chloride concentration the ratio of na cl ranges between 0 08 and 1 51 with an average value of 0 67 it was found that 68 of samples had na cl ratio 0 86 it was also observed that the contamination zone of the groundwater was higher in the 5 km spatial range from the shoreline further 24 of samples showed contamination which indicated the possibility of anthropogenic influences where the ratio of na cl was 1 vengosh 2003 when seawater intrudes the ion exchange process takes place between alkali and alkaline earth metals na ion replaces ca and mg ions in the aquifer from carbonate minerals leading to the enrichment of calcium magnesium and bicarbonate ions into aquifers the ratio of the sum of alkaline earth metal to chloride was found higher in groundwater compared to seawater the ratio ca mg cl was found in the range of 0 65 to 7 99 and an average value of 3 68 and a standard deviation of 1 83 table 2 there was an enrichment of sulphate in seawater an interaction of seawater and groundwater may have led to the dissolution of calcium sulphate into the saline water the higher concentration of ratio of calcium and sulphate indicates the seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifer fig 12 for the ratio of ca so4 ratio values varied between 54 31 and 1490 with a standard deviation of 1123 a ratio 1 indicates the intrusion of seawater into groundwater ec is also a good indicator of saltwater intrusion and 16 percent of samples have found ec value 1000 lee and song 2007 this also confirmed the possibility of calcium dissolution from limestone caves and governs calcium enrichment in the coastal aquifer through to ion exchange process fresh groundwater is usually abundant with both carbonate and bicarbonate ions and a small number of chloride ions as compared to seawater bear et al 1999 todd and mays 2004 simpson ratio cl hco₃ co₃ can also be used to delineate the seawater contamination zone as more chloride ions in groundwater contributed to the higher value of simpson s ratio value freshwater is abundant with carbonate and bicarbonate ions giving a lower value of simpson s ratio in this way the groundwater is classified into five classes a ratio value 0 5 indicates good quality fresh water 0 a value from 0 5 to 1 3 indicates slightly contaminated 36 from 1 3 to 2 8 is moderately contaminated 60 from 2 8 to 6 6 is injuriously contaminated 0 and 6 6 is highly contaminated 0 in the study area no samples have values 0 5 and 2 8 which indicated slightly to moderately contaminated groundwater in coastal aquifers the interaction of seawater freshwater causes the loss of sodium ions as it was replaced by calcium ions the enrichment of calcium is a clear indicator of seawater intrusion the source of calcium can be either leaching from surface soil or the dissolution of limestone occurring in the study area naily 2018 carol and kruse 2012 moujabber et al 2006 klassen et al 2014 the value of ca hco₃ so₄ lied between 0 15 and 111 04 with an average value of 5 80 fig 7 the variation for k cl mg cl and so4 cl was found between 0 08 and 1 51 0 01 1 96 and 0 0 07 respectively figs 13 14 15 the value of ca hco₃ so₄ 1 with low k cl mg cl and so₄ cl also demarcated seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifer jones et al 1999 72 of the samples have found the ratio of ca hco₃ so₄ 1 whereas 68 of the samples had a lower na cl ratio 0 86 not a single sample was found to have a low ratio of k cl 0 02 as seawater intrudes into groundwater the absorption of k on clay particles occurs due to silicate weathering which decreases the concentration of k in groundwater vengosh 2003 the ratio of mg cl varies from 0 01 to 1 96 both sulphate and bicarbonates have a higher concentration in groundwater than in seawater it was observed that 76 of the samples had ca hco₃ so₄ 1 and also had an mg cl ratio 1 this indicated the increase in cl concentrations in coastal aquifers similarly the ratio of so4 cl 1 also indicates the intrusion of seawater in groundwater aquifer it was observed that the samples having a ratio of ca hco3 so4 1 also had a ratio of so4 cl 1 abdalla 2016 the ratio of ca na 1 indicates the saltwater intrusion in groundwater gimenez and morell 1997 fig 10 for the study area the value of ca na is distributed between 0 48 and 40 19 with an average value of 6 36 96 of the samples may be contaminated with saltwater intrusion ca na 1 the cation exchange process between seawater and calcium rich rocks is the main cause of the enrichment of calcium ions in coastal aquifers the ca mg ratio varies from 0 27 to 80 93 with an average value of 8 92 and a standard deviation of 16 06 fig 9 the higher ratio of ca mg again indicates the enrichment of calcium ions during the interaction of aquifers with seawater 3 5 correlation matrix of major ions as per table 3 a correlation matrix of major cations and anions was generated to understand the correlation of ions with each other the green and red colors denote positive correlation and negative correlation the dark and light shades represented strong correlation or weak correlation respectively the correlation matrix has shown that total dissolved solid tds was strongly correlated with ec carbonate bicarbonate and sulphate are positively correlated to ec and tds carbonate was strongly positively correlated to magnesium and sodium potassium and calcium are strongly correlated to each other this may confirm the dissolution of limestone with the interaction of na from seawater intrusion and the release of k ions from weathering of rocks containing potassium both chloride and fluoride are strongly correlated to sodium potassium calcium and with each other this strongly advocates the interaction of seawater with limestone minerals releasing calcium potassium and fluoride in the groundwater the strongly correlated ions also revealed the same source or process seawater and limestone for their enrichment in groundwater 3 6 durov plot the durov diagram is another graph used to depict the water chemistry of water samples fig 16 in advance of the piper diagram it uses other parameters ph and tds for the water chemistry interpretation similar to the piper plot it also uses the percentage of major cations and anions meq l in the water samples it calculates the percentage of each cation group to the whole sum of the concentration of major cations calcium magnesium and the sum of sodium and potassium the percentage of each anion group is calculated with the summation of the concentration of sulphate chloride and the sum of both carbonate and bicarbonate lloyd and heathcoat 1985 classified water into three major processes ion exchange simple dissolution or mixing and reverse ion exchange these processes are represented with the arrows 7 to 1 for ion exchange 7 to 3 for simple dissolution or mixing and 3 to 9 for reverse ion exchange most of the samples depicted an ion exchange process and simple dissolution or mixing at ph above 7 and tds 200 a few samples showed weak ion exchange processes in the aquifer the dominant water type ca hco3 with significant magnesium influence was observed in 48 of the samples na hco3 indicating an ion exchange process was found in 24 and non dominating cations and anions were found in 12 of samples showing simple mixing and dissolution calcium and bicarbonate ions dominated in 56 and 76 of the samples respectively 3 7 x ray diffraction xrd data of the area the mineralogical study for the rock samples found in the area was carried out using x ray diffraction the data obtained after xrd analysis provided a d spacing value that was matched with the inventory of known minerals to confirm the presence of the minerals in the sample the parent peak and a subordinate peak of d spacing were compared with standard reference values given by lindholm 1987 for the identification of minerals present in the samples the graph in figs 17 23 was plotted using the software xpert high score version 1 0a the locations of rock samples are shown in fig 1 the carbonate minerals found in middle andaman after the analysis of rock samples were aragonite found in rock samples rs2a rs2b having common intensity peak values 3 396 2 870 2 484 2 481 2 410 calcite found only in rs4 with an intensity peak value 3 030 2 495 chlorite was identified in rs1 with an intensity peak value 7 150 2 870 2 550 2 475 2 390 chromite was observed in rs1 rs4 with a common intensity peak value 2 950 2 520 2 400 dolomite was observed in rs1 rs2a rs2b with a common intensity peak value 4 030 3 690 2 886 2 405 magnetite was found in rs1 rs4 with a common intensity peak value 2 530 2 419 pyrite was confirmed in rs2b rs3 rs4 with a common intensity peak value 2 709 2 423 2 212 these minerals confirmed the presence of limestone deposits in the area the presence of aragonite showed evidence of burial and metamorphism of the rocks of the mithakari formation 3 8 base exchange index bex the base exchange index is an index of salinization that shows the negative value for seawater intrusion and positive values for the freshwater aquifer it was observed that the bex values were between 195 30 and 2 17 with a mean value of 7 34 the negative value of bex indicated a higher concentration of na mg k relative to chloride ions a zero value of bex indicated the absence of base ion exchange in the area stuyfzand 1989 the spatial map of bex fig 24 showed the effect of saltwater intrusion a large portion in middle below numbudera a few spots in the southern region and some parts of the northern region of the study area bex index showed that about 32 of groundwater samples are under the effect of seawater intrusion 3 9 integrated seawater intrusion the integrated seawater intrusion diagram was made after the integration of all the ratio parameters on arcgis 10 8 it was classified based on the sum of the ionic ratios strongly affected 8 moderately affected 6 7 slightly affected 4 5 and not affected 4 fig 25 showed the moderately affected 44 slightly affected 54 and not affected 2 saline groundwater in the area asare et al 2021 not a single sample was found strongly affected by seawater influences the effect of seawater intrusion was found in the north and middle with a small spot in the southern part as a moderately affected area in comparison to groundwater depth fig 26 the deep aquifers of nimbudera and basantipur are less affected by seawater intrusion possibly due to groundwater recharge through interconnected fractures preventing seawater intrusion through the hydraulic gradient the shallow aquifers of mayabunder and rangat were found moderately affected by seawater intrusion the seashore extension of seawater intrusion was found above nimbudera and above basantipur the integration map of ionic ratio with earthquakes active faults fractured zone deep lineaments fig 25 as the area already falls in earthquake zone v seismic activities are very common in the study area the earthquake shockwave also triggered the structural change in limestone deposits manchi and sankaran 2009 studied the impact of the 2004 earthquakes on limestone caves and stated the impact caused the narrowing widening fractional or complete shutting of present cave openings 2 collapsed rocks inside caves and 3 advanced existing cracks and fissures the combination of active faults with earthquakes can be beneficial and disastrous for groundwater development the connected fault found in the nimbudera and basantipura is found to be a good zone for groundwater recharge the fault perpendicular to the sea provides an opening for seawater intrusion resulting in the dissolution of limestone as well the seawater sample taken from mayabunder was near the fault opening which lies perpendicular to the seashore that showed a higher amount of calcium ions than sodium generally seawater usually contains nacl dominance but the study area reported calcium chloride dominance in the sea the higher value of bicarbonate in seawater again confirmed the limestone weathering in the study area similar to mayabunder govindpur and monsdera are also having active faults perpendicular to seawater the limestone minerals were present in all the rock samples in varied quantities the middle of the study area has ophiolite group exposure overlying mithakari and bhartang formations geologically the mithakari formation has associated with a good aquifer zone with a good source of groundwater recharge zone sedimentary formation does not support the infiltration of surface water into the subsurface zone therefore the sea level rise or extraction of groundwater may have developed a hydraulic gradient to infiltrate seawater in island aquifers similar way seismic activities have created an explosion of the fracture within ophiolite that further provoked the mithakari as well as bhartang formations to develop a more interconnected fracture since some of the fractures have an opening in the sea seawater can intrude through them so a precautionary measure must be taken so that the existing quality of the groundwater of the aquifer does not deteriorate over time 4 conclusion the ionic ratio data showed the relative abundance of various constituents of water in the aquifer the intrusion of seawater in freshwater changes the relative abundance of water parameters we could successfully differentiate freshwater from seawater based on these ionic ratios the schoeller diagram aided in understanding the relative milli equivalent proportion of each ion present in water and depicted limestone dissolution higher concentration of calcium and bicarbonate with a higher concentration of chloride than sodium seawater effect the gis platform was found useful in the spatial visualization of bex ionic ratios active faults and geological formation bivariate plots have provided data on the enrichment of alkali metal salt and alkaline earth metal salts the correlation matrix has depicted the strong relationships of chloride ions with major ions such as na k ca and f strongly correlated durov plots described the major water types ca hco3 48 and na hco3 24 and the processes reverse ion exchange 56 or mixing of seawater 12 of the samples taking place in the aquifer the shallow aquifer s proximity to the sea was found to be affected by seawater intrusion the influence of seawater was found to be as follows so4 cl 100 ca so4 100 ca na 96 mg cl 76 ca hco3 so4 64 cl hco3 co3 36 cl hco3 16 ca mg cl 2 ca mg 0 k cl 0 the integrated result has shown that the study area was found to be moderately affected 44 slightly affected 54 and not affected in 2 samples only further x ray diffraction plots of rock samples confirmed the presence of limestone minerals calcite aragonite chlorite chromite dolomite magnetite and pyrite in the area the presence of limestone was indicative due to the dominance of calcium ions in coastal seawater further the tectonic metamorphic changes have been instrumental in the development of unconformity and lineament these linear features needed to be monitored with utmost care to infer the possibility of seawater intrusion especially in those areas where the openings of these fractures are associated with the coastal terrain the current research has demarcated the salt affected region of the coastal aquifer but it has not incorporated the effect of groundwater flow with an accurate hydraulic gradient even though the current research has described little about the role of earthquakes through active fault data is still limited to understanding

1200,seawater intrusion has become a common problem in coastal and island aquifers with the rise in climate change that greatly affects the majority of developing countries the island hydrology is very complex and associated with a unique set of environmental characteristics with the dynamic interaction of groundwater surface water and seawater further sea level rise erratic rainfall and over extraction of groundwater triggered salt water intrusion a study on seawater intrusion and the effect of limestone caves on groundwater was carried out in middle andaman using a combination of ionic ratios of major ions a total of 24 samples and a reference sample from the sea were collected and analysed using icp spectrophotometer and flame photometer a combination of 10 ionic ratios cl hco3 ca hco3 so4 ca mg cl ca mg ca na cl so4 hco3 ca so4 k cl mg cl and so4 cl was used to assess the dissolution of limestone minerals and the level of saltwater intrusion into groundwater the geospatial method was used to extract and combine all the hydrogeochemical parameters and ionic ratios in the gis platform durov plot was used for the interpretation of groundwater chemistry and the identification of natural processes controlling the hydrogeochemistry of the area the dominance of ca hco3 and na hco3 was confirmed in 48 and 24 of the sample respectively the equiline graph of chloride with other major ions showed the enrichment of alkali and alkaline earth metal salt in groundwater schoeller s diagram depicted the dominance of cl ca and the sum of co3 and hco3 in seawater near mayabunder the lower concentration of na with respect to cl 64 and ca 100 showed the presence of a reverse ion exchange process further the correlation matrix showed a strong relationship between cl k ca and na the analysis of x ray diffraction of the rock samples confirmed the presence of limestones such as aragonite calcite chlorite chromite dolomite magnetite and pyrite in the study area the integration of ionic ratios showed moderately affected and slightly affected saline regions in 44 and 54 of the region respectively finally the role of tectonic activities and active lineaments connected to the sea was found to play a major role in the intrusion of seawater where interconnected faults created an opening for surface water to recharge groundwater leading to the deep aquifer keywords limestone caves seawater intrusion hydrogeochemical investigation middle andaman ionic ratios data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is a prominent source of water for drinking domestic irrigation and industrial usage in villages and cities in major countries adimalla et al 2020 gill et al 2017 subramani et al 2005 the quantity and quality of groundwater are two significant aspects that sustain life on earth the insufficient availability of surface water to meet the increased water requirement has led to more dependency on groundwater to fulfil the demand for potable water supply therefore quality of groundwater quality has become an important concern in many parts of the country the source of groundwater contamination is mainly through interaction with minerals atmospheric precipitation recharging water quality along with anthropogenic pollution coming from domestic agricultural and industrial activities li et al 2021 selvakumar et al 2017 tamta 2003 srivastava et al 2012 seawater intrusion is one of the most common and widespread sources of groundwater contamination in islands and coastal region of the world akshitha et al 2021 naily 2018 abdalla et al 2015 ahmed et al 2013 allow 2012 abdollahi nasab et al 2010 lee and song 2007 post 2005 chidambaram et al 2014 the identification and assessment of seawater intrusion are very important for the prevention and mitigation of contamination in aquifers the seawater intrusion of an aquifer in island areas is a product of multiple salination processes with different sources of water climate change such as erratic rainfall accelerated sea level rise and the over extraction of groundwater increases the lateral movement of seawater into groundwater werner 2010 dragoni and sukhija 2008 natural occurring rocks containing minerals like halite and anthropogenic effluents from households agriculture and industries are other possible causes of groundwater contamination rena et al 2022 singh et al 2018 rajkumar et al 2010 milnes 2011 jones et al 1999 custodio 2010 the interaction of island aquifer with seawater is associated with several processes such as mineral dissolution or precipitation of salt s reverse ion exchange and the reduction of sulphate which indicate the intensity of salinization in groundwater rani et al 2021 sakram et al 2013 elango and kannan 2007 appelo and postma 2005 the groundwater intrusion is further controlled by several parameters like the difference in the rate of recharge and rate of discharge of freshwater in the aquifer distance from the shoreline hydraulic conductivity aquifer depth and the confining units in the aquifer which prevents the movement of saltwater vertically upward or inside the aquifer saidi et al 2013 barlow and reichard 2010 the groundwater quality can be deteriorated by mixing only 2 of saltwater studies have shown that 4 of mixing can lead to significant impairment of groundwater quality causing adverse environmental conditions if the mixing of saltwater increases to 6 it becomes unsuitable for human consumption but can be used by some industries srinivasamoorthy et al 2013 mondal et al 2011 custodio 2010 darnault and godinez 2008 since seawater intrusion is so complex and geochemically connected it further requires a combination of indicators to study its occurrences in the islands bhagat et al 2021 sajil kumar 2016 kazakis et al 2016 rajmohan and elango 2004 seawater intrusion has been investigated or monitored using approaches like geophysical geochemistry and groundwater flow models age transport pathways and seawater wedge theory can be identified through isotopes and water chemistry mohanty and rao 2019 ganyaglo et al 2017 werner and simmons 2009 vengosh 2003 louvat et al 1999 naidu et al 2013 since these above stated studies are very costly the study of ratios of major ion concentration is the only feasible way for saline water delineation studies have shown that freshwater has a dominance of major ions such as calcium magnesium bicarbonates sulphates chloride sodium and potassium while seawater majorly contains chloride and sodium ions only thus intrusion of seawater inland aquifers may be detected by analyzing the increase in these ions in the aquifers srinivasamoorthy et al 2013 mondal et al 2011 todd and mays 2004 bear et al 1999 the concentration of these ions changes from the recharging area to discharging area of aquifers connected to the sea and the ionic ratios of major ions change at the interaction of groundwater and seawater through ion exchange processes and oxidation reduction reactions naily 2018 marimuthu et al 2005 stoessell 1997 gimenez and morell 1997 as a result a lot of ionic ratios have been proposed to identify salinization in coastal areas such as na cl ca mg ca na and cl hco₃ so₄ asare et al 2021 carol and kruse 2012 marimuthu et al 2005 lee and song 2007 panno et al 2006 gimenez and morell 1997 vengosh 2003 the change in the ratio of the molar concentration of ions associated with seawater intrusion may give dissimilar results therefore an integration of their result is used to arrive at a consistent decision the current research has also included the hydrogeological assessment of aquifer spatial and statistical analysis of ionic ratios correlation analysis of major ions major hydro chemical processes x ray diffraction of rocks and finally inter correlation of seawater intrusion with active faults and groundwater level of middle andaman 1 1 study area middle andaman is part of the andaman and nicobar group of islands system in the southeast part of the indian subcontinent the study area is a part of the andaman series that lies between north andaman and south andaman connected through national highway nh 223 the geographical extent of middle andaman is 12 24 19 984 e to 12 55 38 788 e latitude and 92 48 15 417 n to 92 58 49 854 n longitude fig 1 most of the region 80 comprises a range of open to dense forests the forest of the region is classified as moist deciduous and tropical evergreen forest the vegetation of the andaman islands is similar to malaysian islands and burmese islands in comparison to the mainland of the indian subcontinent the biota species of the region belong to marine habitats the island s beaches are the nesting sites of sea snakes and sea turtles ganeshaiah et al 2019 rao 1996 1 2 geology of the area middle andaman is part of the outer arc of the arakan yoma range that formed the main chain of andaman and nicobar islands it is made of sedimentary rocks mainly from marine deposits singha et al 2019 kumar 1981 jafri et al 1993 srinivasan 1979 limestone caves are formed in lithified rocks of aggerated particulate matter sankaran 1998 the location of caves is controlled either by the source of sediments or their transformation into rocks gulam rasool et al 2022 ford and cullingford 1976 most limestone caves are formed by either underground drainage erosion or sea cliffs or sea erosion of rocks challinor 1967 out of 384 caves found on the island 61 5 are inland and 38 5 are sea shore among inland caves 86 are underground 1 are at the origin of streams and the rest are above the ground either on inland cliffs or inland hills they have very fragile ecosystems their fauna is too sensitive to humidity temperature and light fig 2 the study area lies in earthquake and tsunami prone areas which causes occasional damage to these caves the impact on caves was first documented in 2004 earthquakes in both middle andaman and north andaman it caused structural changes such as opening closing partial closing narrowing or widening of many existing caves it was found that more damage had happened to caves that were above the ground than the caves below the ground manchi and sankaran 2009 the limestone in shallow water was found to be associated with the mithakhari mélange group of the paleocene eocene age mélange itself is self explanatory in indicating that there was a mixing of the lithological units due to tectonic activities these mélanges when deposited as unconformity forms a suitable formation for groundwater exploration mithakari or baratang formation has two other members of the rock chain called tugapur limestone berma dera and karmatang sandstone limestones i e lensoid and folded structures are in contact with sandstone units between rangat and mayabandar of middle andaman berma dera sector has an area of 4000 m2 and a reservoir of approximately 10 000 tons per meter depth of limestone whereas the tugapur sector has approximately 8500 tons per meter depth in a surface area of 3000 m2 in the buddha nala a reservoir of approximately 12 000 tons per meter depth of limestone is present on the surface of 5000 m2 bandopadhyay and carter 2017 1 3 hydrology map of the area island receives abundant rainfall of approx 3000 mm per annum but the undulating terrain with steep slopes porous soil stratum and its proximity to the sea leads to a loss of 75 of the annual rainfall also the abundance of sedimentary rocks 70 and the presence of clay minerals contribute to the unfavourable condition for rainfall percolation to sub surface water fig 3 therefore we are getting aquifers unsuitable for groundwater storage in both shallow and deep horizons on the contrary the presence of 15 coral rags or limestone formation and the remaining 15 of igneous rocks provide favourable conditions for a sustainable aquifer in the region mukherjee 1986 bandopadhyay and carter 2017 the ophiolite rocks of igneous origin intruded in sandstone formation have higher aerial fracture density than sedimentary rocks the fracture density has greater control over drainage density for groundwater development and is associated with the presence of good aquifers the weathered sandstone rocks may also be a source of water but of low transmissivity roy et al 2005 2 methodology and data analyses 2 1 groundwater sampling groundwater sampling points have been chosen based on surface manifestation from satellite images as well as the accessibility of the groundwater site a total of 25 samples were collected from different parts of middle andaman of which 24 samples were from groundwater and one sample from seawater as a reference most of the samples were collected from an open well except one sample from spring water sample no 11 the samples were collected in polypropylene plastic bottles for cation and anion analysis separately the bottles were rinsed from the sampling water at least three times before the collection of samples also precautions were taken to minimize the impact of the material of the pipe and biases on the representative sample the groundwater samples were geolocated using garmin gps global positioning system the parameters like ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were recorded using handheld probes the water samples collected for cations were preserved by adding a few drops of concentrated hno3 and stored at a cool temperature 4 c further samples were filtered through 0 45 m pore filter paper before analysis 2 2 groundwater parameter analysis major anions and major cations analysis were done in the laboratory using standard methods given by the american public health association apha 2005 and diatloff and rengel 2001 sodium potassium and calcium were measured using the elico flame photometer elico cl 378 and magnesium was measured using icp oes agilent 5110 major anions such as carbonate bicarbonate and chloride were analysed by using the titrimetric method whereas nitrate phosphate and sulphate were analysed using uv vis spectrophotometer perkin elmer lambda 35 with tri method malachite green method and barium sulphate method respectively apha 2005 ph ec and tds were measured on the sampling site using a probe multiparameter test 35 series the accuracy of groundwater parameters was calculated using charge balance error cbe it assumes the neutrality of charge in natural water domenico and schwartz 1997 cbe c a c a where c and a are the sums of cations and anions meq l respectively the value of charge balance error cbe was found in the range of 5 in all the water samples the average minimum maximum and standard deviation of cbe of all the samples was found to be 0 02 0 42 0 24 and 0 19 respectively as all the samples were within the acceptable limit water parameters were assumed to be good for further analysis firstly major cations and major anions were converted from mg l to meq l to remove the effect of charge in the calculation a total of ten ionic ratios were taken to estimate the seawater intrusion in the study area klassen and allen 2017 lee and song 2007 bear et al 1999 nadler et al 1980 rosenthal 1988 these groundwater chemical ionic ratios were found to be na cl na ca mg cl ca mg cl so₄ hco₃ k cl so₄ cl cl hco₃ ca mg cl and ca hco₃ so₄ further the base exchange index bex was calculated to distinguish the undergoing process of salination or recharging freshening stuyfzand 2008 a positive value of bex indicates refreshing water a negative value represents salination and a zero value means the absence of base exchange bex na k mg 1 0716 cl meq l the equiline graph is generated using ms excel 2019 whereas durov and schoeller s diagram was plotted using aqqa version 1 1 1 the earthquake data was taken from the usgs earth explorer from 1990 to 2022 with a richter scale of 5 arcgis 10 8 was used for generating the spatial map of ionic ratios using the inverse distance weightage method idw further maps were integrated using the spatial overlay technique 3 result and discussion 3 1 evaluation of water quality parameters table 1 is a summary of the water quality parameters meq l comprised of the minimum maximum mean median and standard deviation of the major ions it was observed that the electrical conductivity value of water samples varied from 100 μs cm to 1500 μs cm with an average value of 548 μs cm 60 of samples were found above 500 μs cm chloride concentration varied between 0 98 meq l to 270 55 meq l with an average value of 12 47 meq l cl and ec are two parameters that are universally accepted indicators of seawater intrusion the high value of cl and ec is indicative of seawater intrusion in our study area a high value of chloride and ec were found in the samples taken near the coast chloride is the single parameter found in seawater due to its conservative nature it shares 55 of tds in seawater and that makes it a very sensitive indicator of contamination of seawater in groundwater nadler et al 1980 moujabber et al 2006 jones et al 1999 panno et al 2006 it was found that the water sample taken from the sea near mayabunder jatti sample no 25 also shown in fig 4 had a high concentration of calcium 175 12 meq l sodium 87 45 meq l potassium 5 01 meq l chloride 270 meq l and sulphate 0 09 meq l 3 2 schoeller diagram in addition to the summarised data table 1 the schoeller diagram illustrated the relative concentrations meq l of major ions in each sample it allowed to accommodate a large number of chemical constituents for comparison and investigation as per fig 4 the pattern of ions obtained from different sources of groundwater indicated that the seawater sample sea1 showed the dominance of chloride and calcium ions while the lower concentration of sodium with respect to chloride and calcium ions showed the presence of reverse ion exchange governing between sodium from seawater and calcium from limestone minerals it was also found that bicarbonate has a higher value in all the samples except seawater whereas calcium was found dominant in all the samples including seawater the chloride value meq l was found higher value than sodium in 76 of the samples the loss of sodium ions is probably due to the replacement of the sodium ion exchange process in groundwater we may infer the possibility of seawater intrusion in the area 3 3 equiline graphs of chloride with major ions the concentrations of chloride were plotted against the major ions na ca mg k so4 no3 hco3 and ec fig 5 and the least r square value of linear regression was determined stoessell 1997 explained the good linear coefficient of determination between the cl and major ions like na ca and k showed a possible mixing of freshwater with single brine chemistry the intrusion of seawater provided the replacement of sodium with the same milliequivalent concentration of calcium and carbonate with chloride fig 5a f similarly the analysis of seawater depicted a higher concentration of potassium and chloride indicating the seawater influence in the aquifers the equiline graphs fig 5a d c of potassium calcium and sodium showed a strong relation with chloride possibly due to the interaction of seawater with limestone and aquifers of the island on the other hand the equiline graph between ec and chloride did not show any linear correlation with each other the dominance of ec over chloride and equal concentration meq l of sodium and chloride suggested enrichment evaporation nacl aerosol or direct mixing of seawater the dominance of bicarbonate over chloride shows the weathering of carbonate minerals from limestone deposition in the study area the dominance of chloride over nitrate and sulphate wipes out the possibility of anthropogenic influence in the aquifer the highest value shown in the graph is the seawater sample from the coast of mayabunder in the middle andaman umarani et al 2019 lakshmanan et al 2003 3 4 spatial map of ionic ratio the summarised table of the mean minimum maximum and standard deviation of the ionic ratios is shown in table 2 equiline graphs and schoeller showed that seawater intrusion is the major cause of low groundwater quality in most of the island s aquifers the salinity caused by seawater intrusion has been associated with a lower value of sodium than chloride in groundwater compared to seawater vengosh 2003 in the case of saltwater intrusion the ratio of na cl declines in saline groundwater and that is lower than that of marine water 0 86 schoeller 1967 this is because when seawater intrudes into groundwater a chemical exchange process takes place between rocks and seawater mercado 1985 nadler et al 1980 and calcium ions replace sodium ions resulting in depletion in sodium ion concentration but no change in chloride concentration the ratio of na cl ranges between 0 08 and 1 51 with an average value of 0 67 it was found that 68 of samples had na cl ratio 0 86 it was also observed that the contamination zone of the groundwater was higher in the 5 km spatial range from the shoreline further 24 of samples showed contamination which indicated the possibility of anthropogenic influences where the ratio of na cl was 1 vengosh 2003 when seawater intrudes the ion exchange process takes place between alkali and alkaline earth metals na ion replaces ca and mg ions in the aquifer from carbonate minerals leading to the enrichment of calcium magnesium and bicarbonate ions into aquifers the ratio of the sum of alkaline earth metal to chloride was found higher in groundwater compared to seawater the ratio ca mg cl was found in the range of 0 65 to 7 99 and an average value of 3 68 and a standard deviation of 1 83 table 2 there was an enrichment of sulphate in seawater an interaction of seawater and groundwater may have led to the dissolution of calcium sulphate into the saline water the higher concentration of ratio of calcium and sulphate indicates the seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifer fig 12 for the ratio of ca so4 ratio values varied between 54 31 and 1490 with a standard deviation of 1123 a ratio 1 indicates the intrusion of seawater into groundwater ec is also a good indicator of saltwater intrusion and 16 percent of samples have found ec value 1000 lee and song 2007 this also confirmed the possibility of calcium dissolution from limestone caves and governs calcium enrichment in the coastal aquifer through to ion exchange process fresh groundwater is usually abundant with both carbonate and bicarbonate ions and a small number of chloride ions as compared to seawater bear et al 1999 todd and mays 2004 simpson ratio cl hco₃ co₃ can also be used to delineate the seawater contamination zone as more chloride ions in groundwater contributed to the higher value of simpson s ratio value freshwater is abundant with carbonate and bicarbonate ions giving a lower value of simpson s ratio in this way the groundwater is classified into five classes a ratio value 0 5 indicates good quality fresh water 0 a value from 0 5 to 1 3 indicates slightly contaminated 36 from 1 3 to 2 8 is moderately contaminated 60 from 2 8 to 6 6 is injuriously contaminated 0 and 6 6 is highly contaminated 0 in the study area no samples have values 0 5 and 2 8 which indicated slightly to moderately contaminated groundwater in coastal aquifers the interaction of seawater freshwater causes the loss of sodium ions as it was replaced by calcium ions the enrichment of calcium is a clear indicator of seawater intrusion the source of calcium can be either leaching from surface soil or the dissolution of limestone occurring in the study area naily 2018 carol and kruse 2012 moujabber et al 2006 klassen et al 2014 the value of ca hco₃ so₄ lied between 0 15 and 111 04 with an average value of 5 80 fig 7 the variation for k cl mg cl and so4 cl was found between 0 08 and 1 51 0 01 1 96 and 0 0 07 respectively figs 13 14 15 the value of ca hco₃ so₄ 1 with low k cl mg cl and so₄ cl also demarcated seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifer jones et al 1999 72 of the samples have found the ratio of ca hco₃ so₄ 1 whereas 68 of the samples had a lower na cl ratio 0 86 not a single sample was found to have a low ratio of k cl 0 02 as seawater intrudes into groundwater the absorption of k on clay particles occurs due to silicate weathering which decreases the concentration of k in groundwater vengosh 2003 the ratio of mg cl varies from 0 01 to 1 96 both sulphate and bicarbonates have a higher concentration in groundwater than in seawater it was observed that 76 of the samples had ca hco₃ so₄ 1 and also had an mg cl ratio 1 this indicated the increase in cl concentrations in coastal aquifers similarly the ratio of so4 cl 1 also indicates the intrusion of seawater in groundwater aquifer it was observed that the samples having a ratio of ca hco3 so4 1 also had a ratio of so4 cl 1 abdalla 2016 the ratio of ca na 1 indicates the saltwater intrusion in groundwater gimenez and morell 1997 fig 10 for the study area the value of ca na is distributed between 0 48 and 40 19 with an average value of 6 36 96 of the samples may be contaminated with saltwater intrusion ca na 1 the cation exchange process between seawater and calcium rich rocks is the main cause of the enrichment of calcium ions in coastal aquifers the ca mg ratio varies from 0 27 to 80 93 with an average value of 8 92 and a standard deviation of 16 06 fig 9 the higher ratio of ca mg again indicates the enrichment of calcium ions during the interaction of aquifers with seawater 3 5 correlation matrix of major ions as per table 3 a correlation matrix of major cations and anions was generated to understand the correlation of ions with each other the green and red colors denote positive correlation and negative correlation the dark and light shades represented strong correlation or weak correlation respectively the correlation matrix has shown that total dissolved solid tds was strongly correlated with ec carbonate bicarbonate and sulphate are positively correlated to ec and tds carbonate was strongly positively correlated to magnesium and sodium potassium and calcium are strongly correlated to each other this may confirm the dissolution of limestone with the interaction of na from seawater intrusion and the release of k ions from weathering of rocks containing potassium both chloride and fluoride are strongly correlated to sodium potassium calcium and with each other this strongly advocates the interaction of seawater with limestone minerals releasing calcium potassium and fluoride in the groundwater the strongly correlated ions also revealed the same source or process seawater and limestone for their enrichment in groundwater 3 6 durov plot the durov diagram is another graph used to depict the water chemistry of water samples fig 16 in advance of the piper diagram it uses other parameters ph and tds for the water chemistry interpretation similar to the piper plot it also uses the percentage of major cations and anions meq l in the water samples it calculates the percentage of each cation group to the whole sum of the concentration of major cations calcium magnesium and the sum of sodium and potassium the percentage of each anion group is calculated with the summation of the concentration of sulphate chloride and the sum of both carbonate and bicarbonate lloyd and heathcoat 1985 classified water into three major processes ion exchange simple dissolution or mixing and reverse ion exchange these processes are represented with the arrows 7 to 1 for ion exchange 7 to 3 for simple dissolution or mixing and 3 to 9 for reverse ion exchange most of the samples depicted an ion exchange process and simple dissolution or mixing at ph above 7 and tds 200 a few samples showed weak ion exchange processes in the aquifer the dominant water type ca hco3 with significant magnesium influence was observed in 48 of the samples na hco3 indicating an ion exchange process was found in 24 and non dominating cations and anions were found in 12 of samples showing simple mixing and dissolution calcium and bicarbonate ions dominated in 56 and 76 of the samples respectively 3 7 x ray diffraction xrd data of the area the mineralogical study for the rock samples found in the area was carried out using x ray diffraction the data obtained after xrd analysis provided a d spacing value that was matched with the inventory of known minerals to confirm the presence of the minerals in the sample the parent peak and a subordinate peak of d spacing were compared with standard reference values given by lindholm 1987 for the identification of minerals present in the samples the graph in figs 17 23 was plotted using the software xpert high score version 1 0a the locations of rock samples are shown in fig 1 the carbonate minerals found in middle andaman after the analysis of rock samples were aragonite found in rock samples rs2a rs2b having common intensity peak values 3 396 2 870 2 484 2 481 2 410 calcite found only in rs4 with an intensity peak value 3 030 2 495 chlorite was identified in rs1 with an intensity peak value 7 150 2 870 2 550 2 475 2 390 chromite was observed in rs1 rs4 with a common intensity peak value 2 950 2 520 2 400 dolomite was observed in rs1 rs2a rs2b with a common intensity peak value 4 030 3 690 2 886 2 405 magnetite was found in rs1 rs4 with a common intensity peak value 2 530 2 419 pyrite was confirmed in rs2b rs3 rs4 with a common intensity peak value 2 709 2 423 2 212 these minerals confirmed the presence of limestone deposits in the area the presence of aragonite showed evidence of burial and metamorphism of the rocks of the mithakari formation 3 8 base exchange index bex the base exchange index is an index of salinization that shows the negative value for seawater intrusion and positive values for the freshwater aquifer it was observed that the bex values were between 195 30 and 2 17 with a mean value of 7 34 the negative value of bex indicated a higher concentration of na mg k relative to chloride ions a zero value of bex indicated the absence of base ion exchange in the area stuyfzand 1989 the spatial map of bex fig 24 showed the effect of saltwater intrusion a large portion in middle below numbudera a few spots in the southern region and some parts of the northern region of the study area bex index showed that about 32 of groundwater samples are under the effect of seawater intrusion 3 9 integrated seawater intrusion the integrated seawater intrusion diagram was made after the integration of all the ratio parameters on arcgis 10 8 it was classified based on the sum of the ionic ratios strongly affected 8 moderately affected 6 7 slightly affected 4 5 and not affected 4 fig 25 showed the moderately affected 44 slightly affected 54 and not affected 2 saline groundwater in the area asare et al 2021 not a single sample was found strongly affected by seawater influences the effect of seawater intrusion was found in the north and middle with a small spot in the southern part as a moderately affected area in comparison to groundwater depth fig 26 the deep aquifers of nimbudera and basantipur are less affected by seawater intrusion possibly due to groundwater recharge through interconnected fractures preventing seawater intrusion through the hydraulic gradient the shallow aquifers of mayabunder and rangat were found moderately affected by seawater intrusion the seashore extension of seawater intrusion was found above nimbudera and above basantipur the integration map of ionic ratio with earthquakes active faults fractured zone deep lineaments fig 25 as the area already falls in earthquake zone v seismic activities are very common in the study area the earthquake shockwave also triggered the structural change in limestone deposits manchi and sankaran 2009 studied the impact of the 2004 earthquakes on limestone caves and stated the impact caused the narrowing widening fractional or complete shutting of present cave openings 2 collapsed rocks inside caves and 3 advanced existing cracks and fissures the combination of active faults with earthquakes can be beneficial and disastrous for groundwater development the connected fault found in the nimbudera and basantipura is found to be a good zone for groundwater recharge the fault perpendicular to the sea provides an opening for seawater intrusion resulting in the dissolution of limestone as well the seawater sample taken from mayabunder was near the fault opening which lies perpendicular to the seashore that showed a higher amount of calcium ions than sodium generally seawater usually contains nacl dominance but the study area reported calcium chloride dominance in the sea the higher value of bicarbonate in seawater again confirmed the limestone weathering in the study area similar to mayabunder govindpur and monsdera are also having active faults perpendicular to seawater the limestone minerals were present in all the rock samples in varied quantities the middle of the study area has ophiolite group exposure overlying mithakari and bhartang formations geologically the mithakari formation has associated with a good aquifer zone with a good source of groundwater recharge zone sedimentary formation does not support the infiltration of surface water into the subsurface zone therefore the sea level rise or extraction of groundwater may have developed a hydraulic gradient to infiltrate seawater in island aquifers similar way seismic activities have created an explosion of the fracture within ophiolite that further provoked the mithakari as well as bhartang formations to develop a more interconnected fracture since some of the fractures have an opening in the sea seawater can intrude through them so a precautionary measure must be taken so that the existing quality of the groundwater of the aquifer does not deteriorate over time 4 conclusion the ionic ratio data showed the relative abundance of various constituents of water in the aquifer the intrusion of seawater in freshwater changes the relative abundance of water parameters we could successfully differentiate freshwater from seawater based on these ionic ratios the schoeller diagram aided in understanding the relative milli equivalent proportion of each ion present in water and depicted limestone dissolution higher concentration of calcium and bicarbonate with a higher concentration of chloride than sodium seawater effect the gis platform was found useful in the spatial visualization of bex ionic ratios active faults and geological formation bivariate plots have provided data on the enrichment of alkali metal salt and alkaline earth metal salts the correlation matrix has depicted the strong relationships of chloride ions with major ions such as na k ca and f strongly correlated durov plots described the major water types ca hco3 48 and na hco3 24 and the processes reverse ion exchange 56 or mixing of seawater 12 of the samples taking place in the aquifer the shallow aquifer s proximity to the sea was found to be affected by seawater intrusion the influence of seawater was found to be as follows so4 cl 100 ca so4 100 ca na 96 mg cl 76 ca hco3 so4 64 cl hco3 co3 36 cl hco3 16 ca mg cl 2 ca mg 0 k cl 0 the integrated result has shown that the study area was found to be moderately affected 44 slightly affected 54 and not affected in 2 samples only further x ray diffraction plots of rock samples confirmed the presence of limestone minerals calcite aragonite chlorite chromite dolomite magnetite and pyrite in the area the presence of limestone was indicative due to the dominance of calcium ions in coastal seawater further the tectonic metamorphic changes have been instrumental in the development of unconformity and lineament these linear features needed to be monitored with utmost care to infer the possibility of seawater intrusion especially in those areas where the openings of these fractures are associated with the coastal terrain the current research has demarcated the salt affected region of the coastal aquifer but it has not incorporated the effect of groundwater flow with an accurate hydraulic gradient even though the current research has described little about the role of earthquakes through active fault data is still limited to understanding the role of tides tsunamis and disastrous events in the movement of seawater into aquifers of islands there is a future possibility of studying groundwater modeling using geophysical data time series analysis through machine learning techniques with accurate real time weather data tides movement and groundwater flow detection using isotopes and age dating for understanding the lateral movement of seawater through the hydraulic gradient declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

1201,heavy metal pollution in surface freshwaters is prevalent globally and is an environmental issue of concern many studies have described sources concentrations in selected waterbodies and toxic effects in biological systems the purpose of the present study was to assess the status of heavy metal pollution in nigerian surface freshwaters as well as the ecological and public health risks associated with current levels of pollution a literature review of studies which assessed concentrations of heavy metals in named freshwater bodies around the country was done to gather relevant data these waterbodies included rivers lagoons and creeks the data gathered was subjected to a meta analysis using referenced heavy metal pollution indices sediment quality guidelines ecological risk indices and non carcinogenic and carcinogenic human health risk indices the result obtained showed that concentrations of cd cr mn ni and pb in nigerian surface freshwaters are higher than the maximum recommended levels in drinking water the heavy metal pollution indices calculated using drinking water quality criteria by the world health organization and the us environmental protection agency were also significantly higher than the threshold value of 100 13 672 74 and 1890 65 respectively these results indicate that the surface waters are unsafe for drinking purposes the enrichment factor contamination factor and ecological risk factor indices for cadmium 684 62 41 73 and 1251 90 respectively were all higher than the maximum threshold for each index 40 6 320 respectively these results indicate that cadmium contributes significantly to the ecological risk associated with pollution in nigerian surface waters in terms of public health risk the current levels of heavy metal pollution in nigerian surface waters pose both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to children and adults who are exposed through ingestion and dermal routes as shown by results from the present study nigeria is blessed with abundant surface freshwater resources and many coastal indigenous populations use the water resources for drinking and domestic purposes many of them are also commercial fish farmers earning their daily living from fisheries resources heavy metal pollution must be regulated to levels below which end users and aquatic life are protected from adverse impacts of pollution keywords heavy metal pollution water quality sediment quality ecological risk human health risk pollution control 1 introduction heavy metals hms are naturally occurring elements usually found in rocks soils and sediments in pre industrial times the concentrations of hms in surface freshwaters were usually governed by natural processes such as leaching from underground rocks and sediments sibal and espino 2018 however over the past several decades anthropogenic activities have resulted in a significant steady increase of hm concentrations in surface waters around the world creating a global environmental pollution problem zhou et al 2020 heavy metal pollution in surface waters constitutes an ecological and public health risk because of the high probability to induce toxic manifestations in biological systems kumar et al 2019 heavy metals are not degradable by natural processes thus remain in the environment for prolonged periods these metals can also be bioaccumulated in biological systems and biomagnified along the food chain although some hms such as zinc zn copper cu chromium cr and selenium se are classified as micronutrients and known to be vital for enzymatic processes in biological systems these metals are still toxic at high enough concentrations vareda et al 2019 others such as mercury hg cadmium cd and lead pb are not beneficial to living organisms and are highly toxic at low concentrations bolan et al 2013 the toxicity of hms in surface waters is dependent on metal speciation egorova and ananikov 2017 and the prevailing water chemistry conditions tan and wang 2011 for example the oxides of nickel ni and zn are less toxic than the chloride forms egorova and ananikov 2017 water chemistry factors such as hardness alkalinity ph salinity and inorganic and organic ions have been reported to modify hm toxicity adams et al 2020 and these factors are called toxicity modifying factors tmf brix et al 2020 heavy metals have been detected in all media in surface waters including in water sediment particulate matter and organisms vareda et al 2019 however many studies document concentrations in the water column and sediment only the average concentrations of hms cd pb cr ni al and mn detected in surface freshwaters around the world africa asia europe and south america respectively over the last five decades have exceeded safe limits prescribed by who and usepa zhou et al 2020 there has also been a marked increase in concentrations of heavy metals recorded in surface waters in the 1990s 2000s and 2010s as compared to the concentrations recorded in the 1970s and 1980s zhou et al 2020 in terms of continental variations the same study by zhou et al 2020 showed that higher concentrations of most of the hms assessed were recorded in africa asia and south america compared to concentrations recorded in europe and north america average global concentrations of some hms have peaked at mg l concentrations compared to ng l or μg l background concentrations in a study to evaluate the mean global concentrations of hms in water bodies by kumar et al 2019 they reported that co with a concentration of 3 995 mg l and as with a concentration of 3 982 mg l had the highest mean values they also observed that the mean values of all hms analysed cr mn fe co ni as cd and hg except cu and zn exceeded the who 2017 guideline for drinking water other studies that evaluated hm pollution in surface freshwaters in different countries have also reported concentrations in the μg l to mg l range for many hms and exceeding recommended national or international standards zhen et al 2016 rosca et al 2020 a study by dippong et al 2018 reported cd cu pb and zn concentrations up to 0 093 μg l 6 73 μg l 3 4 μg l and 0 106 mg l respectively in the northern part of the strimtori firiza reservoir romania gunes 2022 evaluated the metal pollution in the water and sediment of bartin river turkey he reported average concentrations 1 97 μg l and 7 2 μg l for cu and zn respectively in the surface water of the river during the rainy season in nigeria there is appreciable published data on the prevailing concentrations of hms in the water column and sediment of surface freshwaters ogunfowokan et al 2013 uzoekwe and aigberua 2019 ihunwo et al 2020 kuton et al 2021 which indicates active pollution this pollution issue like the current global situation has been attributed to the discharge of untreated and poorly treated domestic industrial agricultural and mining effluents uzairu et al 2014 anifowose and oyebode 2019 nigeria like other sub saharan african countries is vulnerable to the issues of environmental pollution due to limited capacities and resources to encourage the use of cleaner technologies and to develop and enforce effective regulatory standards pollution in freshwater ecosystems if left unchecked can have devastating effects on ecosystem health public health and biodiversity several studies including that of dippong et al 2020 have reported elevated concentrations of metals in freshwater used for drinking purposes fisheries resources from freshwater ecosystems are also a vital protein source for most of the local population and the coastal indigenous communities earn their daily living from commercial fishing activities the present study aimed to review existing literature on the prevailing concentrations of hms in nigerian surface freshwaters from isolated studies carried out in different regions of the country the data obtained were used to assess the level of pollution as well as ecological and public health risks associated with pollution risk assessment is a process that is vital in preventing catastrophic events and has been employed in understanding the problems associated with hm pollution in aquatic ecosystems qu et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 prasad et al 2020 ustaoğlu and aydın 2020 it is envisaged that data from this study will give a clear perspective on the status of hm pollution in nigerian surface waters and highlight associated risks to ecosystem health and end users of freshwater resources 2 materials and method 2 1 data collection published data on the concentrations of hms in surface waters and sediments of rivers streams creeks and lagoons in different regions of nigeria were sourced online the online search was done between february and april 2022 and was conducted using google scholar research gate web of science and sciencedirect the keywords searched included heavy metal concentration heavy metal in surface water heavy metal pollution in nigeria heavy metal in freshwater in nigeria the literature selected from the search and reviewed were those published in english language and in reputable peer review journals a prisma flow chart for the search and selection of literature is presented in supplementary fig 1 a total of 46 journal articles detailing hm concentrations from 30 rivers 4 creeks and 2 lagoons around the 6 geopolitical regions of nigeria were assessed of the 46 articles 20 described hm concentrations in surface waters located in the southwest sw region of the country 13 described the same data for surface waters located in the south south ss region 6 for the northcentral nc region 3 each for the southeast se and northwest nw regions and 1 for the northeast ne region of the country fig 1 and table s1 70 of the research reviewed were carried out and published between the year 2011 and year 2021 while 28 was between 2000 and 2010 the remaining 2 were research carried out before the year 2000 2 2 data analysis data on the concentration of nine hms cd co cr cu mn ni pb zn and fe in water and or sediment of surface freshwaters across the country were retrieved from the publications and was used for meta analysis descriptive analysis was done in microsoft excel version 2301 and graphics was used to illustrate the variation in the data on concentrations of the hms collected from the different geopolitical regions of the country 2 3 pollution assessment three pollution indices were used to assess the level of hm pollution in waters and sediment of freshwaters across the country based on prevailing data retrieved from literature 2 3 1 heavy metal pollution index hpi this index was used to assess the level of heavy metal pollution in the surface waters and determine if these waters are safe for drinking and domestic purposes the index describes the cumulative effect of individual hms in surface waters and it was calculated as prasad and bose 2001 nasrabadi 2015 kumar et al 2019 1 hpi i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where w i is the unit weighting of the ith hm which is calculated as the inverse of the recommended standard for each hm q i is the sub index for the ith hm and n is the number of hms and in the present study is nine cd co cr cu mn ni pb zn and fe the sub index q i is calculated as 2 q i i 1 n m i i i s i i i x 100 where m i is the measured concentration of the ith hm i i and s i are the ideal and standard concentrations of the ith hm μg l which was taken from who 2017 and us epa 2009 in the present study the critical value for hpi for drinking purposes is 100 according to prasad and bose 2001 nasrabadi 2015 and kumar et al 2019 an hpi 100 indicates that the water is not safe for drinking 2 3 2 heavy metal evaluation index hei this index was used to categorize the level of pollution resulting from the presence of heavy metals in surface waters the index describes the overall surface water quality concerning hm concentrations in water it is calculated according to al ani et al 1987 ameh 2013 and kumar et al 2019 as 3 hei i 1 n mi maci where m i is the measured concentration of the ith hm and mac i is the monitored value and maximum admissible concentration of ith hm in water adapted from siegel 2002 and kumar et al 2019 classifications of surface water quality based on calculated hei are 10 for low 10 20 for moderate and 20 for high pollution kumar et al 2019 2 3 3 sediment quality evaluation using consensus based sediment quality guidelines sqgs this index was used to evaluate the quality of surface water sediments in relation to prevailing sediment concentrations of heavy metals sediments with poor quality will be toxic to sediment dwelling organisms consensus based sqgs macdonald et al 2000 are used to evaluate the degree of pollution of sediments the consensus based threshold effect concentration tecs and probable effect concentration pecs developed by macdonald et al 2000 were used to assess the degree of pollution of surface water sediments in the present study the tecs are the concentrations below which adverse effect to sediment organisms is not expected to occur and pecs are concentrations above which adverse effects to sediment organisms are expected to occur the pec quotient niu et al 2009 which describes the potential toxicity of sediments was also employed in the present study and is calculated as 4 mean pec quotient n 1 i c i p e c i n where ci is the concentration of the ith metal and peci is the respective pec for the metal sediments with a pec quotient 0 5 are non toxic while sediments with a pec quotient 0 5 are toxic niu et al 2009 2 4 ecological and human health risk assessment several indices were used to assess ecological risk associated with hms in sediments non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk indices were used to assess human health risk associated with hms in surface waters 2 4 1 ecological risk assessment of heavy metal pollution in sediments the ecological risk associated with prevailing concentrations of heavy metals in sediments of the surface waters was assessed to ascertain the level of enrichment since pre industrial times source of enrichment degree of contamination and potential ecological risk to the aquatic ecosystem particularly sediment dwelling organisms the following indices were used to assess these parameters i geo accumulation index muller 1969 this index compares measured hm concentrations in sediments to pre industrial values it is calculated as 5 geo accumulation index igeo log 2 ci 1 5 cri where ci is the concentration of metal i in the sediment and cri is the pre industrial concentration of metal i factor 1 5 is used to normalize possible variations in background values for a given metal in the environment muller 1969 banat et al 2005 ii enrichment factor reimann and de caritat 2005 this index is used to determine the source of metals in sediments soils and other environmental materials it is calculated as 6 enrichment factor ef ci cie s ci cie rs where ci is the measured concentration of metal i and cie is the concentration of the immobile metal ie in the present study iron fe was used as the immobile metal zhang et al 2007 ci cie s is the ratio of metal i to the immobile metal in the sample while ci cie rs is the ratio of the metal i to the immobile metal in the reference sample pre industrial values the criteria used to interpret calculated values for igeo and ef muller 1969 sutherland 2000 buccolieri et al 2006 are described in supplementary table 2 iii contamination factor and degree of contamination hakanson 1980 these indices describe the degree of contamination of a waterbody by hms present in the water or sediment 7 contamination factor cif ci cri where ci is the measured concentration of metal i and cri is the pre industrial value of metal i 8 degree of contamination cd i 1 m c f i where c f i is the index of contamination factor for each metal and m is the total number of metals assessed the criteria used to interpret the values of cif and cd are described in supplementary table 3 pekey et al 2004 caeiro et al 2005 iv ecological risk factor and potential ecological risk factor hakanson 1980 the ecological risk factor assesses the risk of metal in the environment while the potential ecological risk factor is the sum of the ecological risk of all metals assessed 9 ecological risk factor eri tri cif where tri is the toxic response factor of respective metals hakanson 1980 and cif is the contamination factor of respective metals 10 potential ecological risk factor ri i 1 m er i where er i is the single index of ecological risk factor and m is the total number of metals assessed the criteria to interpret the calculated values of eri and ri are described in supplementary table 4 hakanson 1980 2 4 2 human health risk assessment since surface freshwaters are commonly employed for drinking and domestic purposes by local coastal populations it was pertinent to assess human health risk associated with prevailing concentrations of heavy metals in the surface waters the risk of hm pollution in water to human health was assessed by evaluating the risk of exposure through ingestion and dermal routes us epa 2004 kumar et al 2019 to children and adults respectively the risk of exposure was calculated as us epa 2004 11 adding ci x ir x absg x ef x ed bw x at 12 addderm ci x sa x kp x et x ef x ed x ev x cf bw x at where adding μg kg day and addderm μg kg day are average daily doses through ingestion and dermal routes from water respectively c i is the concentration of heavy metal i μg l the definitions and values of the other parameters in eqns 11 and 12 are presented in supplementary table 5 subsequently the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks from exposure through ingestion and dermal routes were also evaluated the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi were employed to assess non carcinogenic risk us epa 2013 and was calculated as 13 hqing adding rfding 14 hqderm addderm rfdderm 15 hi hqing hqderm where rfding and rfdderm are the ingestion and dermal daily reference dose respectively μg kg day hqing and hqderm are the hazard quotient through ingestion and dermal exposures respectively hi is the hazard index and can be categorized into two hi 1 indicates a low non carcinogenic risk of heavy metals to human health and hi 1 indicates a possible non carcinogenic risk of heavy metals to human health kumar et al 2019 the carcinogenic risk which assesses the possible risk of cancer due to exposure to hms was evaluated by employing the cancer index ci and carcinogenic risk from ingestion and dermal exposures cring and crderm according to us epa 2004 2005 16 cring adding x sf 17 crderm addderm x sf 18 ci cring crderm where sf is the slope factor a toxicity value which describes the relationship between dose and response us epa 2005 the safe range for ci us epa united states environmental protection agency 1989 us epa 2004 kumar et al 2019 is 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 3 results 3 1 heavy metal concentrations in water of nigerian freshwaters the analysis of reviewed data on water according to geopolitical regions showed that the mean concentration of fe was highest compared to other heavy metals in the nw nw sw and ss regions in the se region the mean concentration of zn was highest compared to the other heavy metals fig 2 analysis of data for the country showed that the mean concentrations of zn and fe were highest in water 1 10 mg l and 2 31 mg l respectively and the mean concentration of cd was lowest with a value of 0 09 mg compared to the other hms table 1 the mean concentrations of cd cr mn ni pb and fe were higher than standards for concentrations of hms in drinking water prescribed by who 2017 us epa 2009 and nigerian industrial standard nis 2015 3 2 heavy metal concentrations in the sediment of nigerian freshwaters the analysis of reviewed data on sediment according to geopolitical regions showed that the mean concentration of fe in sediment was highest compared to other hms in all regions nw nc sw and ss expect for the ne region in the ne region the mean concentration of zn was highest compared to other hms fig 3 analysis of data for the country showed that the mean concentration of fe was highest 3526 02 mg kg while the mean concentration of cd was lowest 6 26 mg kg compared to other hms in sediments of nigerian freshwaters table 2 the mean concentrations of all the hms reviewed except mn and fe were higher than background concentrations in unpolluted sediments 3 3 assessment of pollution using heavy metal pollution indices 3 3 1 heavy metal pollution index hpi the assessment of the level of pollution resulting from heavy metal concentrations in surface water using the hpi showed that freshwaters in nigeria are polluted with hms and unsuitable for domestic purposes the hpi in nigerian surface freshwaters based on who 2017 drinking water guidelines is 13 672 74 table 3 while the hpi based on us epa 2009 drinking water guidelines is 1890 65 table 4 according to prasad and bose 2001 nasrabadi 2015 and kumar et al 2019 water with hpi 100 is unsuitable for drinking 3 3 2 heavy metal evaluation index hei assessment of pollution using the hei showed that nigerian surface freshwaters are highly polluted the hei obtained is 120 67 table 5 according to kumar et al 2019 surface waters with hei 20 can be termed highly polluted and water unfit for domestic or drinking purposes 3 3 3 assessment of sediment quality using consensus based sediment quality guidelines sqgs assessment of sediment quality using the consensus based sqgs showed that sediments of nigerian freshwaters are potentially toxic with a pec quotient of 0 72 according to niu et al 2009 sediments with a pec quotient 0 5 are non toxic while sediments with a pec quotient 0 5 are toxic table 6 3 4 assessment of the ecological risks associated with heavy metal pollution in sediments the assessment of the level of heavy metal pollution in sediments compared to pre industrial concentrations using the geo accumulation index i geo showed that cd has an extreme level of pollution in the sediments with i geo 8 37 which is higher than the maximum threshold value of 5 table s2 the i geo for pb is 1 22 which indicates moderate pollution the i geo for the other hms co cr ni zn and fe ranged from 0 05 to 0 50 indicating minimal pollution the enrichment factor was used to determine the source of hm enrichment in the sediments results showed that cd and pb have extremely high enrichment in the sediments with ef values of 648 62 and 64 36 respectively which are higher than maximum threshold value of 40 table s2 cobalt has a high enrichment with an ef value of 40 41 while zn ni and cu have significant enrichment with ef values of 27 26 16 08 and 15 51 respectively the ef value for cr is 3 93 indicating moderate enrichment the assessment of the contamination factor and the degree of contamination which is used to describe the degree of contamination of a water body based on hm concentrations in the sediment revealed that nigerian freshwaters have a very high degree of contamination from hms with a c d value of 52 21 which is higher than the maximum threshold value of 36 for the present study table s3 the hms contributing significantly to the degree of contamination are cd and pb with c i f values of 41 73 and 4 05 respectively the assessment of the ecological risk factor which describes the ecological risk associated with hms in sediments showed that cd poses a very high ecological risk with an er i value of 1251 90 which is higher than the maximum threshold value of 320 table s4 the er i values for all the other hms co cr cu ni pb zn and fe indicate a low ecological risk the potential ecological risk index ri which specifies the cumulative risk from all hms assessed is 1296 78 which is higher than the maximum threshold value of 600 table s4 indicating that there is a high ecological risk associated with hms in sediments of nigerian freshwaters table 7 3 5 assessment of human health risk associated with heavy metal pollution in nigerian freshwaters the non carcinogenic health risk to children and adults associated with hm pollution in nigerian freshwaters was calculated using the ingestion and dermal routes these routes are the major routes of exposure to hms present in surface waters for populations who use the water for drinking and other domestic purposes the hazard index hi which describes the cumulative hazard quotients hq through the ingestion and dermal routes showed that cd co cr and pb having his 1 pose non carcinogenic health risks to children and adults using surface waters for domestic purposes the other hms cu mn ni zn and fe have his 1 indicating that the prevailing concentrations of these metals do not pose non carcinogenic health risk to users of the surface waters table 8 the threshold value for determine possible non carcinogenic risk is 1 kumar et al 2019 the carcinogenic health risk associated with hms having potential carcinogenic toxicity was also assessed results showed that the cancer index cis for children and adults respectively for all the hms assessed cd cr ni and pb were 10 4 indicating potential carcinogenic risk if the surface waters are used for domestic and drinking purposes table 9 4 discussion data gathered from an extensive literature review done in the present study has shown that average concentrations of hms such as cd cr mn ni pb and fe in nigerian surface freshwaters exceed maximum desirable concentrations in drinking water as prescribed by us epa 2009 nigerian industrial standard nis 2015 and who 2017 respectively most of the research in the published literature reviewed were carried out in the sw region of the country and between the year 2011 and year 2021 the findings from the present study are similar to findings from a previous review study that assessed the mean global concentrations of hms in surface waters kumar et al 2019 and another that assessed the total concentrations of hms in global lakes and rivers over five decades and across five continents zhou et al 2020 in the study by kumar et al 2019 eight out of the ten hms assessed cr mn fe co ni as cd and hg had average concentrations above maximum permissible limits in drinking water according to who 2017 in the study by zhou et al 2020 many of the hms they assessed in the surface waters had higher mean concentrations in the 1990s 2000s and 2010s compared to the 1970s and 1980s like results obtained for water results from the present study also showed that the concentrations of the hms in the sediment of the surface freshwaters were also higher than background concentrations in unpolluted sediments other studies that have assessed heavy metal pollution in designated freshwater ecosystems around the world have also documented elevated concentrations of heavy metals in both surface water and sediment abdel satar et al 2017 dippong et al 2018 2020 gunes 2022 it is generally accepted that the increased concentrations of hms detected in surface waters and other aspects of the environment including land and air over the past few decades can be attributed majorly to anthropogenic activities including but not limited to fossil fuel burning industrial activities mining activities agricultural activities among others the study by zhou et al 2020 also revealed that higher concentrations of hms were recorded in rivers and lakes of africa compared to europe and north america and the sources were attributed to fertilizer and pesticide usage the aggravated situation of hm pollution in aquatic ecosystems of africa is not unrelated to the non existing or ineffective pollution control and environmental regulation measures many african countries including nigeria adopt environmental standards set by international organizations such as who and usepa however regulations and standards for heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems should be site specific and based on prevailing water chemistry parameters to be maximally effective in protecting aquatic life and users of water resources schlekat et al 2020 the hpi and hei were used to assess surface water quality concerning hm pollution in the present study these indices have been employed by several scholars to assess the impact of hm pollution on the use of surface waters particularly for drinking and domestic purposes abdel satar et al 2017 cengiz et al 2017 al hussaini et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 in the present study it was shown that the current levels of hm pollution have rendered nigerian surface waters unsafe for drinking purposes according to guidelines by who 2017 and us epa 2009 respectively this finding is like that of kumar et al 2019 who did a global evaluation of hm pollution in surface water bodies they reported that the aggregation of water bodies assessed in their study had hpi 100 and thus are unsafe for drinking purposes according to who 2017 guidelines other studies that have assessed the water quality of individual waterbodies as opposed to an aggregation of waterbodies in a region or country as done in the present study have also reported similar findings giri and singh 2014 kumar et al 2020 however the impact of hm pollution in many individual waterbodies is significant but not yet critical hpi 100 as shown in studies by nasrabadi 2015 abdel satar et al 2017 cengiz et al 2017 al hussaini et al 2018 and prasad et al 2020 in these waterbodies the impacts of hm pollution may become critical if effective pollution control measures are not deployed the consensus based sediment quality guideline sqgs was employed to assess the quality of freshwater sediments in the present study the guideline was developed by macdonald et al 2000 and parameters in the guideline such as the pec was derived from the geometric mean of previously determined pec type sqgs which were selected based on pre determined criteria the advantage of the consensus based sqg is that it has harmonized sqgs proposed from previous studies and provides an easy approach to assessing sediment quality results from the present study showed that sediments of nigerian surface waters are potentially toxic to aquatic organisms due to hm pollution the mean pec quotient derived from the pecs of the heavy metals analysed cd cr cu ni pb and zn was 0 5 which is the threshold value for potential toxicity the finding from the present study is similar to findings from other studies that have employed the consensus based sqg to assess sediment quality due to hm pollution islam et al 2018 employed the consensus based sqg to assess hm pollution in the sediment of the feni river estuary in bangladesh their research showed that ni and cr will exhibit toxicity in the ecosystem hongyi et al 2009 assessed the potential risk of hms from sediment of the pearl river in south china also using the consensus based sqg and reported that the sediments of most of the sites they assessed are potentially toxic due to hm pollution in addition to sediment quality the ecological risks associated with hm pollution in the sediments were also assessed in the present study ecological risks were assessed using different indices including the geo accumulation index i geo enrichment factor ef contamination factor c i f and ecological risk factor er i these indices have been employed by many researchers to assess hm pollution in sediments and associated risks ogunfowokan et al 2013 uzoekwe and aigberua 2019 chen et al 2019 olayinka olagunju 2021 usman et al 2021 the level of cd pollution in the sediments of nigerian surface waters is extreme as revealed by the assessment using the i geo the level of pb pollution is moderate while other hms co cr ni zn and fe have a minimal level of pollution with regards to enrichment an assessment done using the ef index showed that all hms analysed except cr have significant to extremely high enrichment in the sediments cadmium and pb have the highest level of enrichment compared to the other hms co cu ni and zn assessment of contamination using the degree of contamination index c d showed that the surface waters have a high degree of contamination with cd and pb being the main contributors to contamination the er i which is used to assess ecological risk associated with individual hms showed that present levels of cd pose a very high ecological risk to the freshwater ecosystems the cumulative potential ecological risk of all the hms assessed using ri also indicates that there is a high ecological risk associated with hm pollution in nigerian surface waters from the results described above the potential toxicity and ecological risk associated with hm pollution in nigerian surface freshwaters can be attributed to high levels of cd and pb pollution in the water bodies in the present study the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic human health risk to children and adults associated with current levels of hm pollution in nigerian surface freshwaters was also assessed the results showed that the levels of cd cr ni and pb in the waterbodies pose a non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risk respectively to children and adults using these waters for domestic purposes the risk is particularly associated with exposure to the hms through the ingestion route results of average concentrations of hms in surface waters compared to drinking water standards earlier discussed showed that concentrations of these hms cd cr ni and pb are beyond permissible limits who 2017 and could account for the associated human health risk observed similar observations were reported by kumar et al 2019 who did a global evaluation of hm content in surface water bodies they reported that health risk to children and adults associated with cd cr co and ni respectively in surface water bodies was significant 5 conclusion nigeria is a coastal country bordering the atlantic ocean it has abundant inland freshwater resources which are tributaries of the rivers niger and benue which flow through the country many coastal indigenous populations depend on these inland freshwater resources for drinking and other domestic purposes many individuals in the population are also commercial fish farmers who earn their daily living from fisheries resources the need to minimize and control pollution in surface freshwaters cannot be over emphasized the present study is a novel contribution to the subject area it involved a comprehensive review data and risk analysis of hm pollution in nigerian freshwaters it is anticipated that the findings from the present study will buttress the need for the government and concerned regulatory agencies to harmonize efforts on the effective control and management of hm pollution in freshwater ecosystems surveillance and monitoring systems are essential to track and mitigate pollution levels to prevent public health and ecological disasters funding this research

1201,heavy metal pollution in surface freshwaters is prevalent globally and is an environmental issue of concern many studies have described sources concentrations in selected waterbodies and toxic effects in biological systems the purpose of the present study was to assess the status of heavy metal pollution in nigerian surface freshwaters as well as the ecological and public health risks associated with current levels of pollution a literature review of studies which assessed concentrations of heavy metals in named freshwater bodies around the country was done to gather relevant data these waterbodies included rivers lagoons and creeks the data gathered was subjected to a meta analysis using referenced heavy metal pollution indices sediment quality guidelines ecological risk indices and non carcinogenic and carcinogenic human health risk indices the result obtained showed that concentrations of cd cr mn ni and pb in nigerian surface freshwaters are higher than the maximum recommended levels in drinking water the heavy metal pollution indices calculated using drinking water quality criteria by the world health organization and the us environmental protection agency were also significantly higher than the threshold value of 100 13 672 74 and 1890 65 respectively these results indicate that the surface waters are unsafe for drinking purposes the enrichment factor contamination factor and ecological risk factor indices for cadmium 684 62 41 73 and 1251 90 respectively were all higher than the maximum threshold for each index 40 6 320 respectively these results indicate that cadmium contributes significantly to the ecological risk associated with pollution in nigerian surface waters in terms of public health risk the current levels of heavy metal pollution in nigerian surface waters pose both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to children and adults who are exposed through ingestion and dermal routes as shown by results from the present study nigeria is blessed with abundant surface freshwater resources and many coastal indigenous populations use the water resources for drinking and domestic purposes many of them are also commercial fish farmers earning their daily living from fisheries resources heavy metal pollution must be regulated to levels below which end users and aquatic life are protected from adverse impacts of pollution keywords heavy metal pollution water quality sediment quality ecological risk human health risk pollution control 1 introduction heavy metals hms are naturally occurring elements usually found in rocks soils and sediments in pre industrial times the concentrations of hms in surface freshwaters were usually governed by natural processes such as leaching from underground rocks and sediments sibal and espino 2018 however over the past several decades anthropogenic activities have resulted in a significant steady increase of hm concentrations in surface waters around the world creating a global environmental pollution problem zhou et al 2020 heavy metal pollution in surface waters constitutes an ecological and public health risk because of the high probability to induce toxic manifestations in biological systems kumar et al 2019 heavy metals are not degradable by natural processes thus remain in the environment for prolonged periods these metals can also be bioaccumulated in biological systems and biomagnified along the food chain although some hms such as zinc zn copper cu chromium cr and selenium se are classified as micronutrients and known to be vital for enzymatic processes in biological systems these metals are still toxic at high enough concentrations vareda et al 2019 others such as mercury hg cadmium cd and lead pb are not beneficial to living organisms and are highly toxic at low concentrations bolan et al 2013 the toxicity of hms in surface waters is dependent on metal speciation egorova and ananikov 2017 and the prevailing water chemistry conditions tan and wang 2011 for example the oxides of nickel ni and zn are less toxic than the chloride forms egorova and ananikov 2017 water chemistry factors such as hardness alkalinity ph salinity and inorganic and organic ions have been reported to modify hm toxicity adams et al 2020 and these factors are called toxicity modifying factors tmf brix et al 2020 heavy metals have been detected in all media in surface waters including in water sediment particulate matter and organisms vareda et al 2019 however many studies document concentrations in the water column and sediment only the average concentrations of hms cd pb cr ni al and mn detected in surface freshwaters around the world africa asia europe and south america respectively over the last five decades have exceeded safe limits prescribed by who and usepa zhou et al 2020 there has also been a marked increase in concentrations of heavy metals recorded in surface waters in the 1990s 2000s and 2010s as compared to the concentrations recorded in the 1970s and 1980s zhou et al 2020 in terms of continental variations the same study by zhou et al 2020 showed that higher concentrations of most of the hms assessed were recorded in africa asia and south america compared to concentrations recorded in europe and north america average global concentrations of some hms have peaked at mg l concentrations compared to ng l or μg l background concentrations in a study to evaluate the mean global concentrations of hms in water bodies by kumar et al 2019 they reported that co with a concentration of 3 995 mg l and as with a concentration of 3 982 mg l had the highest mean values they also observed that the mean values of all hms analysed cr mn fe co ni as cd and hg except cu and zn exceeded the who 2017 guideline for drinking water other studies that evaluated hm pollution in surface freshwaters in different countries have also reported concentrations in the μg l to mg l range for many hms and exceeding recommended national or international standards zhen et al 2016 rosca et al 2020 a study by dippong et al 2018 reported cd cu pb and zn concentrations up to 0 093 μg l 6 73 μg l 3 4 μg l and 0 106 mg l respectively in the northern part of the strimtori firiza reservoir romania gunes 2022 evaluated the metal pollution in the water and sediment of bartin river turkey he reported average concentrations 1 97 μg l and 7 2 μg l for cu and zn respectively in the surface water of the river during the rainy season in nigeria there is appreciable published data on the prevailing concentrations of hms in the water column and sediment of surface freshwaters ogunfowokan et al 2013 uzoekwe and aigberua 2019 ihunwo et al 2020 kuton et al 2021 which indicates active pollution this pollution issue like the current global situation has been attributed to the discharge of untreated and poorly treated domestic industrial agricultural and mining effluents uzairu et al 2014 anifowose and oyebode 2019 nigeria like other sub saharan african countries is vulnerable to the issues of environmental pollution due to limited capacities and resources to encourage the use of cleaner technologies and to develop and enforce effective regulatory standards pollution in freshwater ecosystems if left unchecked can have devastating effects on ecosystem health public health and biodiversity several studies including that of dippong et al 2020 have reported elevated concentrations of metals in freshwater used for drinking purposes fisheries resources from freshwater ecosystems are also a vital protein source for most of the local population and the coastal indigenous communities earn their daily living from commercial fishing activities the present study aimed to review existing literature on the prevailing concentrations of hms in nigerian surface freshwaters from isolated studies carried out in different regions of the country the data obtained were used to assess the level of pollution as well as ecological and public health risks associated with pollution risk assessment is a process that is vital in preventing catastrophic events and has been employed in understanding the problems associated with hm pollution in aquatic ecosystems qu et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 prasad et al 2020 ustaoğlu and aydın 2020 it is envisaged that data from this study will give a clear perspective on the status of hm pollution in nigerian surface waters and highlight associated risks to ecosystem health and end users of freshwater resources 2 materials and method 2 1 data collection published data on the concentrations of hms in surface waters and sediments of rivers streams creeks and lagoons in different regions of nigeria were sourced online the online search was done between february and april 2022 and was conducted using google scholar research gate web of science and sciencedirect the keywords searched included heavy metal concentration heavy metal in surface water heavy metal pollution in nigeria heavy metal in freshwater in nigeria the literature selected from the search and reviewed were those published in english language and in reputable peer review journals a prisma flow chart for the search and selection of literature is presented in supplementary fig 1 a total of 46 journal articles detailing hm concentrations from 30 rivers 4 creeks and 2 lagoons around the 6 geopolitical regions of nigeria were assessed of the 46 articles 20 described hm concentrations in surface waters located in the southwest sw region of the country 13 described the same data for surface waters located in the south south ss region 6 for the northcentral nc region 3 each for the southeast se and northwest nw regions and 1 for the northeast ne region of the country fig 1 and table s1 70 of the research reviewed were carried out and published between the year 2011 and year 2021 while 28 was between 2000 and 2010 the remaining 2 were research carried out before the year 2000 2 2 data analysis data on the concentration of nine hms cd co cr cu mn ni pb zn and fe in water and or sediment of surface freshwaters across the country were retrieved from the publications and was used for meta analysis descriptive analysis was done in microsoft excel version 2301 and graphics was used to illustrate the variation in the data on concentrations of the hms collected from the different geopolitical regions of the country 2 3 pollution assessment three pollution indices were used to assess the level of hm pollution in waters and sediment of freshwaters across the country based on prevailing data retrieved from literature 2 3 1 heavy metal pollution index hpi this index was used to assess the level of heavy metal pollution in the surface waters and determine if these waters are safe for drinking and domestic purposes the index describes the cumulative effect of individual hms in surface waters and it was calculated as prasad and bose 2001 nasrabadi 2015 kumar et al 2019 1 hpi i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where w i is the unit weighting of the ith hm which is calculated as the inverse of the recommended standard for each hm q i is the sub index for the ith hm and n is the number of hms and in the present study is nine cd co cr cu mn ni pb zn and fe the sub index q i is calculated as 2 q i i 1 n m i i i s i i i x 100 where m i is the measured concentration of the ith hm i i and s i are the ideal and standard concentrations of the ith hm μg l which was taken from who 2017 and us epa 2009 in the present study the critical value for hpi for drinking purposes is 100 according to prasad and bose 2001 nasrabadi 2015 and kumar et al 2019 an hpi 100 indicates that the water is not safe for drinking 2 3 2 heavy metal evaluation index hei this index was used to categorize the level of pollution resulting from the presence of heavy metals in surface waters the index describes the overall surface water quality concerning hm concentrations in water it is calculated according to al ani et al 1987 ameh 2013 and kumar et al 2019 as 3 hei i 1 n mi maci where m i is the measured concentration of the ith hm and mac i is the monitored value and maximum admissible concentration of ith hm in water adapted from siegel 2002 and kumar et al 2019 classifications of surface water quality based on calculated hei are 10 for low 10 20 for moderate and 20 for high pollution kumar et al 2019 2 3 3 sediment quality evaluation using consensus based sediment quality guidelines sqgs this index was used to evaluate the quality of surface water sediments in relation to prevailing sediment concentrations of heavy metals sediments with poor quality will be toxic to sediment dwelling organisms consensus based sqgs macdonald et al 2000 are used to evaluate the degree of pollution of sediments the consensus based threshold effect concentration tecs and probable effect concentration pecs developed by macdonald et al 2000 were used to assess the degree of pollution of surface water sediments in the present study the tecs are the concentrations below which adverse effect to sediment organisms is not expected to occur and pecs are concentrations above which adverse effects to sediment organisms are expected to occur the pec quotient niu et al 2009 which describes the potential toxicity of sediments was also employed in the present study and is calculated as 4 mean pec quotient n 1 i c i p e c i n where ci is the concentration of the ith metal and peci is the respective pec for the metal sediments with a pec quotient 0 5 are non toxic while sediments with a pec quotient 0 5 are toxic niu et al 2009 2 4 ecological and human health risk assessment several indices were used to assess ecological risk associated with hms in sediments non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk indices were used to assess human health risk associated with hms in surface waters 2 4 1 ecological risk assessment of heavy metal pollution in sediments the ecological risk associated with prevailing concentrations of heavy metals in sediments of the surface waters was assessed to ascertain the level of enrichment since pre industrial times source of enrichment degree of contamination and potential ecological risk to the aquatic ecosystem particularly sediment dwelling organisms the following indices were used to assess these parameters i geo accumulation index muller 1969 this index compares measured hm concentrations in sediments to pre industrial values it is calculated as 5 geo accumulation index igeo log 2 ci 1 5 cri where ci is the concentration of metal i in the sediment and cri is the pre industrial concentration of metal i factor 1 5 is used to normalize possible variations in background values for a given metal in the environment muller 1969 banat et al 2005 ii enrichment factor reimann and de caritat 2005 this index is used to determine the source of metals in sediments soils and other environmental materials it is calculated as 6 enrichment factor ef ci cie s ci cie rs where ci is the measured concentration of metal i and cie is the concentration of the immobile metal ie in the present study iron fe was used as the immobile metal zhang et al 2007 ci cie s is the ratio of metal i to the immobile metal in the sample while ci cie rs is the ratio of the metal i to the immobile metal in the reference sample pre industrial values the criteria used to interpret calculated values for igeo and ef muller 1969 sutherland 2000 buccolieri et al 2006 are described in supplementary table 2 iii contamination factor and degree of contamination hakanson 1980 these indices describe the degree of contamination of a waterbody by hms present in the water or sediment 7 contamination factor cif ci cri where ci is the measured concentration of metal i and cri is the pre industrial value of metal i 8 degree of contamination cd i 1 m c f i where c f i is the index of contamination factor for each metal and m is the total number of metals assessed the criteria used to interpret the values of cif and cd are described in supplementary table 3 pekey et al 2004 caeiro et al 2005 iv ecological risk factor and potential ecological risk factor hakanson 1980 the ecological risk factor assesses the risk of metal in the environment while the potential ecological risk factor is the sum of the ecological risk of all metals assessed 9 ecological risk factor eri tri cif where tri is the toxic response factor of respective metals hakanson 1980 and cif is the contamination factor of respective metals 10 potential ecological risk factor ri i 1 m er i where er i is the single index of ecological risk factor and m is the total number of metals assessed the criteria to interpret the calculated values of eri and ri are described in supplementary table 4 hakanson 1980 2 4 2 human health risk assessment since surface freshwaters are commonly employed for drinking and domestic purposes by local coastal populations it was pertinent to assess human health risk associated with prevailing concentrations of heavy metals in the surface waters the risk of hm pollution in water to human health was assessed by evaluating the risk of exposure through ingestion and dermal routes us epa 2004 kumar et al 2019 to children and adults respectively the risk of exposure was calculated as us epa 2004 11 adding ci x ir x absg x ef x ed bw x at 12 addderm ci x sa x kp x et x ef x ed x ev x cf bw x at where adding μg kg day and addderm μg kg day are average daily doses through ingestion and dermal routes from water respectively c i is the concentration of heavy metal i μg l the definitions and values of the other parameters in eqns 11 and 12 are presented in supplementary table 5 subsequently the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks from exposure through ingestion and dermal routes were also evaluated the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi were employed to assess non carcinogenic risk us epa 2013 and was calculated as 13 hqing adding rfding 14 hqderm addderm rfdderm 15 hi hqing hqderm where rfding and rfdderm are the ingestion and dermal daily reference dose respectively μg kg day hqing and hqderm are the hazard quotient through ingestion and dermal exposures respectively hi is the hazard index and can be categorized into two hi 1 indicates a low non carcinogenic risk of heavy metals to human health and hi 1 indicates a possible non carcinogenic risk of heavy metals to human health kumar et al 2019 the carcinogenic risk which assesses the possible risk of cancer due to exposure to hms was evaluated by employing the cancer index ci and carcinogenic risk from ingestion and dermal exposures cring and crderm according to us epa 2004 2005 16 cring adding x sf 17 crderm addderm x sf 18 ci cring crderm where sf is the slope factor a toxicity value which describes the relationship between dose and response us epa 2005 the safe range for ci us epa united states environmental protection agency 1989 us epa 2004 kumar et al 2019 is 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 3 results 3 1 heavy metal concentrations in water of nigerian freshwaters the analysis of reviewed data on water according to geopolitical regions showed that the mean concentration of fe was highest compared to other heavy metals in the nw nw sw and ss regions in the se region the mean concentration of zn was highest compared to the other heavy metals fig 2 analysis of data for the country showed that the mean concentrations of zn and fe were highest in water 1 10 mg l and 2 31 mg l respectively and the mean concentration of cd was lowest with a value of 0 09 mg compared to the other hms table 1 the mean concentrations of cd cr mn ni pb and fe were higher than standards for concentrations of hms in drinking water prescribed by who 2017 us epa 2009 and nigerian industrial standard nis 2015 3 2 heavy metal concentrations in the sediment of nigerian freshwaters the analysis of reviewed data on sediment according to geopolitical regions showed that the mean concentration of fe in sediment was highest compared to other hms in all regions nw nc sw and ss expect for the ne region in the ne region the mean concentration of zn was highest compared to other hms fig 3 analysis of data for the country showed that the mean concentration of fe was highest 3526 02 mg kg while the mean concentration of cd was lowest 6 26 mg kg compared to other hms in sediments of nigerian freshwaters table 2 the mean concentrations of all the hms reviewed except mn and fe were higher than background concentrations in unpolluted sediments 3 3 assessment of pollution using heavy metal pollution indices 3 3 1 heavy metal pollution index hpi the assessment of the level of pollution resulting from heavy metal concentrations in surface water using the hpi showed that freshwaters in nigeria are polluted with hms and unsuitable for domestic purposes the hpi in nigerian surface freshwaters based on who 2017 drinking water guidelines is 13 672 74 table 3 while the hpi based on us epa 2009 drinking water guidelines is 1890 65 table 4 according to prasad and bose 2001 nasrabadi 2015 and kumar et al 2019 water with hpi 100 is unsuitable for drinking 3 3 2 heavy metal evaluation index hei assessment of pollution using the hei showed that nigerian surface freshwaters are highly polluted the hei obtained is 120 67 table 5 according to kumar et al 2019 surface waters with hei 20 can be termed highly polluted and water unfit for domestic or drinking purposes 3 3 3 assessment of sediment quality using consensus based sediment quality guidelines sqgs assessment of sediment quality using the consensus based sqgs showed that sediments of nigerian freshwaters are potentially toxic with a pec quotient of 0 72 according to niu et al 2009 sediments with a pec quotient 0 5 are non toxic while sediments with a pec quotient 0 5 are toxic table 6 3 4 assessment of the ecological risks associated with heavy metal pollution in sediments the assessment of the level of heavy metal pollution in sediments compared to pre industrial concentrations using the geo accumulation index i geo showed that cd has an extreme level of pollution in the sediments with i geo 8 37 which is higher than the maximum threshold value of 5 table s2 the i geo for pb is 1 22 which indicates moderate pollution the i geo for the other hms co cr ni zn and fe ranged from 0 05 to 0 50 indicating minimal pollution the enrichment factor was used to determine the source of hm enrichment in the sediments results showed that cd and pb have extremely high enrichment in the sediments with ef values of 648 62 and 64 36 respectively which are higher than maximum threshold value of 40 table s2 cobalt has a high enrichment with an ef value of 40 41 while zn ni and cu have significant enrichment with ef values of 27 26 16 08 and 15 51 respectively the ef value for cr is 3 93 indicating moderate enrichment the assessment of the contamination factor and the degree of contamination which is used to describe the degree of contamination of a water body based on hm concentrations in the sediment revealed that nigerian freshwaters have a very high degree of contamination from hms with a c d value of 52 21 which is higher than the maximum threshold value of 36 for the present study table s3 the hms contributing significantly to the degree of contamination are cd and pb with c i f values of 41 73 and 4 05 respectively the assessment of the ecological risk factor which describes the ecological risk associated with hms in sediments showed that cd poses a very high ecological risk with an er i value of 1251 90 which is higher than the maximum threshold value of 320 table s4 the er i values for all the other hms co cr cu ni pb zn and fe indicate a low ecological risk the potential ecological risk index ri which specifies the cumulative risk from all hms assessed is 1296 78 which is higher than the maximum threshold value of 600 table s4 indicating that there is a high ecological risk associated with hms in sediments of nigerian freshwaters table 7 3 5 assessment of human health risk associated with heavy metal pollution in nigerian freshwaters the non carcinogenic health risk to children and adults associated with hm pollution in nigerian freshwaters was calculated using the ingestion and dermal routes these routes are the major routes of exposure to hms present in surface waters for populations who use the water for drinking and other domestic purposes the hazard index hi which describes the cumulative hazard quotients hq through the ingestion and dermal routes showed that cd co cr and pb having his 1 pose non carcinogenic health risks to children and adults using surface waters for domestic purposes the other hms cu mn ni zn and fe have his 1 indicating that the prevailing concentrations of these metals do not pose non carcinogenic health risk to users of the surface waters table 8 the threshold value for determine possible non carcinogenic risk is 1 kumar et al 2019 the carcinogenic health risk associated with hms having potential carcinogenic toxicity was also assessed results showed that the cancer index cis for children and adults respectively for all the hms assessed cd cr ni and pb were 10 4 indicating potential carcinogenic risk if the surface waters are used for domestic and drinking purposes table 9 4 discussion data gathered from an extensive literature review done in the present study has shown that average concentrations of hms such as cd cr mn ni pb and fe in nigerian surface freshwaters exceed maximum desirable concentrations in drinking water as prescribed by us epa 2009 nigerian industrial standard nis 2015 and who 2017 respectively most of the research in the published literature reviewed were carried out in the sw region of the country and between the year 2011 and year 2021 the findings from the present study are similar to findings from a previous review study that assessed the mean global concentrations of hms in surface waters kumar et al 2019 and another that assessed the total concentrations of hms in global lakes and rivers over five decades and across five continents zhou et al 2020 in the study by kumar et al 2019 eight out of the ten hms assessed cr mn fe co ni as cd and hg had average concentrations above maximum permissible limits in drinking water according to who 2017 in the study by zhou et al 2020 many of the hms they assessed in the surface waters had higher mean concentrations in the 1990s 2000s and 2010s compared to the 1970s and 1980s like results obtained for water results from the present study also showed that the concentrations of the hms in the sediment of the surface freshwaters were also higher than background concentrations in unpolluted sediments other studies that have assessed heavy metal pollution in designated freshwater ecosystems around the world have also documented elevated concentrations of heavy metals in both surface water and sediment abdel satar et al 2017 dippong et al 2018 2020 gunes 2022 it is generally accepted that the increased concentrations of hms detected in surface waters and other aspects of the environment including land and air over the past few decades can be attributed majorly to anthropogenic activities including but not limited to fossil fuel burning industrial activities mining activities agricultural activities among others the study by zhou et al 2020 also revealed that higher concentrations of hms were recorded in rivers and lakes of africa compared to europe and north america and the sources were attributed to fertilizer and pesticide usage the aggravated situation of hm pollution in aquatic ecosystems of africa is not unrelated to the non existing or ineffective pollution control and environmental regulation measures many african countries including nigeria adopt environmental standards set by international organizations such as who and usepa however regulations and standards for heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems should be site specific and based on prevailing water chemistry parameters to be maximally effective in protecting aquatic life and users of water resources schlekat et al 2020 the hpi and hei were used to assess surface water quality concerning hm pollution in the present study these indices have been employed by several scholars to assess the impact of hm pollution on the use of surface waters particularly for drinking and domestic purposes abdel satar et al 2017 cengiz et al 2017 al hussaini et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 in the present study it was shown that the current levels of hm pollution have rendered nigerian surface waters unsafe for drinking purposes according to guidelines by who 2017 and us epa 2009 respectively this finding is like that of kumar et al 2019 who did a global evaluation of hm pollution in surface water bodies they reported that the aggregation of water bodies assessed in their study had hpi 100 and thus are unsafe for drinking purposes according to who 2017 guidelines other studies that have assessed the water quality of individual waterbodies as opposed to an aggregation of waterbodies in a region or country as done in the present study have also reported similar findings giri and singh 2014 kumar et al 2020 however the impact of hm pollution in many individual waterbodies is significant but not yet critical hpi 100 as shown in studies by nasrabadi 2015 abdel satar et al 2017 cengiz et al 2017 al hussaini et al 2018 and prasad et al 2020 in these waterbodies the impacts of hm pollution may become critical if effective pollution control measures are not deployed the consensus based sediment quality guideline sqgs was employed to assess the quality of freshwater sediments in the present study the guideline was developed by macdonald et al 2000 and parameters in the guideline such as the pec was derived from the geometric mean of previously determined pec type sqgs which were selected based on pre determined criteria the advantage of the consensus based sqg is that it has harmonized sqgs proposed from previous studies and provides an easy approach to assessing sediment quality results from the present study showed that sediments of nigerian surface waters are potentially toxic to aquatic organisms due to hm pollution the mean pec quotient derived from the pecs of the heavy metals analysed cd cr cu ni pb and zn was 0 5 which is the threshold value for potential toxicity the finding from the present study is similar to findings from other studies that have employed the consensus based sqg to assess sediment quality due to hm pollution islam et al 2018 employed the consensus based sqg to assess hm pollution in the sediment of the feni river estuary in bangladesh their research showed that ni and cr will exhibit toxicity in the ecosystem hongyi et al 2009 assessed the potential risk of hms from sediment of the pearl river in south china also using the consensus based sqg and reported that the sediments of most of the sites they assessed are potentially toxic due to hm pollution in addition to sediment quality the ecological risks associated with hm pollution in the sediments were also assessed in the present study ecological risks were assessed using different indices including the geo accumulation index i geo enrichment factor ef contamination factor c i f and ecological risk factor er i these indices have been employed by many researchers to assess hm pollution in sediments and associated risks ogunfowokan et al 2013 uzoekwe and aigberua 2019 chen et al 2019 olayinka olagunju 2021 usman et al 2021 the level of cd pollution in the sediments of nigerian surface waters is extreme as revealed by the assessment using the i geo the level of pb pollution is moderate while other hms co cr ni zn and fe have a minimal level of pollution with regards to enrichment an assessment done using the ef index showed that all hms analysed except cr have significant to extremely high enrichment in the sediments cadmium and pb have the highest level of enrichment compared to the other hms co cu ni and zn assessment of contamination using the degree of contamination index c d showed that the surface waters have a high degree of contamination with cd and pb being the main contributors to contamination the er i which is used to assess ecological risk associated with individual hms showed that present levels of cd pose a very high ecological risk to the freshwater ecosystems the cumulative potential ecological risk of all the hms assessed using ri also indicates that there is a high ecological risk associated with hm pollution in nigerian surface waters from the results described above the potential toxicity and ecological risk associated with hm pollution in nigerian surface freshwaters can be attributed to high levels of cd and pb pollution in the water bodies in the present study the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic human health risk to children and adults associated with current levels of hm pollution in nigerian surface freshwaters was also assessed the results showed that the levels of cd cr ni and pb in the waterbodies pose a non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risk respectively to children and adults using these waters for domestic purposes the risk is particularly associated with exposure to the hms through the ingestion route results of average concentrations of hms in surface waters compared to drinking water standards earlier discussed showed that concentrations of these hms cd cr ni and pb are beyond permissible limits who 2017 and could account for the associated human health risk observed similar observations were reported by kumar et al 2019 who did a global evaluation of hm content in surface water bodies they reported that health risk to children and adults associated with cd cr co and ni respectively in surface water bodies was significant 5 conclusion nigeria is a coastal country bordering the atlantic ocean it has abundant inland freshwater resources which are tributaries of the rivers niger and benue which flow through the country many coastal indigenous populations depend on these inland freshwater resources for drinking and other domestic purposes many individuals in the population are also commercial fish farmers who earn their daily living from fisheries resources the need to minimize and control pollution in surface freshwaters cannot be over emphasized the present study is a novel contribution to the subject area it involved a comprehensive review data and risk analysis of hm pollution in nigerian freshwaters it is anticipated that the findings from the present study will buttress the need for the government and concerned regulatory agencies to harmonize efforts on the effective control and management of hm pollution in freshwater ecosystems surveillance and monitoring systems are essential to track and mitigate pollution levels to prevent public health and ecological disasters funding this research

1202,elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations have been linked to deleterious health and environmental effects a significant source of the nitrate is nitrogen fertilizers applied to agricultural landscapes beneficial management practices bmps including the optimization of fertilizer use and selective crop rotations have proven to be effective in some cases the city of woodstock in southern ontario relies on public wells for all of its municipal supply several of the wells have experienced chronic increases in nitrate concentrations exceeding the maximum allowable limit of 10 mg l n no3 while bmps are established an interim reduction plan based on enhanced in situ denitrification cross injection system cis in a 15 m thick zone of high nitrate mass flux within the aquifer zone was evaluated based in the results of preliminary acetate injection experiments a c n ratio of 2 35 approximately 260 mg acetate l was selected to optimize the denitrification reaction injections were performed for six hours a day every day for a period of approximately two months dissolved oxygen do and nitrate concentrations recorded over time indicated that reduction of both commenced within a few days of the beginning of the acetate injections and reduced levels were maintained for the remainder of the two month injection period denitrification occurred throughout the profile although nitrate reduction was the highest in the lower groundwater velocity zones an overall reduction of nitrate of 50 was achieved through the treated section of the aquifer it is estimated that an upscaled treatment system utilizing a treatment width of only 70 m would be sufficient to reduce the nitrate concentrations to below the drinking water limit demonstrating the potential for the cis method to functions as an interim groundwater nitrate reduction strategy keywords groundwater nitrate public supply wells beneficial management practices enhanced denitrification interim treatment cross injection system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrate is regulated in drinking water due to suspected links between human consumption and adverse health effects including methaemoglobinaemia johnson et al 1987 gelberg et al 1999 knobeloch et al 2000 and adult cancers ward et al 2010 rising trends in nitrate contamination in groundwater supplies have been attributed in part to diffuse pollution from farming and changes in land use since the mid twentieth century which has involved the long term land application of fertilizers canter 1997 with an increasing global demand for food maximizing crop production through the extensive use of fertilizers including nitrogen is anticipated to remain a common worldwide issue these sources of groundwater contamination have proven very challenging to address in part because the non point source nature of the source confounds treatment focused on a well defined and manageable site the preferred long term option for overcoming the above challenge is the adoption of so called best management practices bmp which aim to change agricultural practices such as increasing the efficiency of fertilizer application and crop choices world health organization 2007 crop nutrients council 2009 however the legacy of decades of excess nitrate loadings to the ground is a reservoir of nitrate in the subsurface above and below the water table that will likely take decades to deplete regardless of when and where nutrient bmps are implemented cole 2008 honisch et al 2002 meissner et al 2002 tomer and burkart 2003 wassenaar et al 2006 kim et al 2021 in the meantime the nitrate reservoir in soil and aquifers poses a threat to drinking water supplies that rely upon groundwater one alternative for resolving this problem is to treat the nitrate in the groundwater at surface when it is pumped from ground in general this alternative is limited by the expense of building and maintaining treatment facilities when the affected communities served are small for example the groundwater at hyawatha ks a town of about 3300 people exceeded the regulatory limit of 10 mg l n no3 in 2017 that town installed a water treatment plant at a cost of 3 5 m clay 2018 a second alternative is to treat the water in situ before it is pumped for this option to be viable one strategy is to treat the water relatively close to the supply wells where the convergence of flow reduces the volume of aquifer note the distinction with the volume of groundwater needing treatment the literature presents several schemes for achieving this objective including single well injection of amendments dual well injection systems daisy well systems and permeable reactive barriers gierczak et al 2007 hiscock et al 1991 khan and spalding 2004 schipper and vojvodić vuković 2001 mercado et al 1988 zhao et al 2022 another scheme the cis was designed to establish a curtain of an injectate spiked water between a system of pumping and extraction wells devlin and barker 1994 the injected water is then permitted to migrate under natural gradient conditions downflow from the injection location to support a groundwater treatment zone this method of biostimulation is hydrogeologically driven it places emphasis on knowledge of the ambient flow system and takes advantage of subsurface solution mixing by dispersive mechanisms devlin and barker 1996 devlin et al 2004 gierczak et al 2007 critchley et al 2014 the approach was also independently developed by dybas et al 1998 2002 for the treatment of carbon tetrachloride they explicitly commented on its utility for nitrate removal summarizing work near the town of woodstock ontario canada rudolph et al 2015 noted that in situ denitrification could compliment crop nutrient bmps to solve the problem of elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations in public supply wells over both the short and long terms critchley et al 2014 set out to demonstrate the viability of stimulating enhanced bioremediation of nitrate immediately up gradient of the town s municipal wells a reactive zone was created over an 11 day period of daily injections using the cis to introduce acetate to the aquifer as an amendment to enhance nitrate reduction followed by a 15 day period of bi daily acetate injections critchley et al 2014 schillig et al 2016 based on previous work at a nearby site in the same physiographic region of ontario which used acetylene block experiments to show that denitrification was the principle mechanism of nitrate removal in the presence of acetate devlin et al 2000 nitrate reduction at the current site was accepted as occurring via denitrification in these experiments nitrite production was found to be small in both the laboratory and field tests and limited to the first few days following the onset of nitrate treatment i e the addition of acetate to the systems no ammonium was detected in any of the actively denitrifying sediments in either the laboratory tests or in field samples devlin et al 2000 critchley et al 2014 in addition isotopic evidence that found a fractionation ratio of δ15n o oo δ18o o oo equal to 2 1 1 critchley et al 2014 which has previously been associated with denitrification aravena and robertson 1998 provided further evidence in support of denitrification as the principal process of subsurface nitrate reduction in this type of natural environment the above demonstration established the viability of the cis in this application but also established limitations imposed by the highly heterogeneous nature of the glacial outwash aquifer at the woodstock site the average groundwater velocity was determined to be about 2 m d based on conventional water level surveys but direct velocity measurements and tracer testing revealed a stratum in which velocities reached or exceeded 30 m d at intermediate depths within the injection site which was located within a few hundred meters of the active public supply wells schillig et al 2016 denitrification was not adequately stimulated in the high velocity strata of the treatment zone to remove nitrate from the groundwater as mentioned previously the experiment was about one month long in duration in which daily injections of acetate were maintained for 11 days and bi daily injections for the remainder of the time the period of daily injections produced the strongest denitrification response and a sustained zone of bioremediation was achieved nevertheless questions remained whether or not a longer stimulation period would have achieved denitrification more uniformly throughout the aquifer the possibility that enhanced levels of acetate delivered to the high velocity zones might improve the treatment performance was also suggested by critchley et al 2014 the current study was designed to evaluate the performance of the csi method over an extended time period 55 days of sustained biostimulation and to assess any subsequent improvements in the uniformity of stimulated denitrification in the aquifer following the suggestion of critchley et al 2014 it was also hypothesized that increasing the frequency and concentration of carbon injections as acetate would result in more complete nitrate removal from the aquifer related requirements for the system were that no undesirable levels of biofouling or other types of clogging due to the acetate loadings should be promoted and no production of secondary substances of concern for health such as nitrite or negative aesthetics such as those related to high levels of dissolved iron should occur 2 background denitrification is a natural process in the subsurface that converts nitrate to dinitrogen gas n2 g where acetate is the electron donor supplied to drive the process the sequence of reactions from nitrate to dinitrogen gas is as follows andre et al 2011 1 n o 3 aq 0 25 c h 3 co o aq 0 25 h aq n o 2 aq 0 5 c o 2 aq 0 5 h 2 o 2 n o 2 aq 0 25 c h 3 co o aq 1 25 h aq 0 5 n 2 o g 0 5 c o 2 aq h 2 o 3 0 5 n 2 o g 0 125 c h 3 co o aq 0 125 h aq 0 5 n 2 g 0 25 c o 2 aq 0 25 h 2 o in situ denitrification takes place without intervention under the correct conditions bacteria capable of mediating this process have been reported to be ubiquitous in the subsurface soares 2000 these conditions include low do near neutral ph an active population of denitrifying bacteria and a source of electrons e g organic carbon dissolved hydrogen sulfide minerals robertson and cherry 1992 starr and gillham 1993 rivett et al 2008 singleton et al 2007 knowles 1982 devlin et al 2000 reviewed various electron donors in aquifers that could enable denitrification compared to inorganic sources of electrons acetate was found to be a highly favourable electron donor and was less likely to promote biofouling than other organic substances they summarized the reaction with acetate as 4 5 c h 3 co o aq 8 n o 3 aq 3 h aq 4 n 2 g 10 hc o 3 aq 4 h 2 o l this stoichiometry was the basis for designing the in situ denitrification systems reported by gierczak et al 2007 and critchley et al 2014 in the latter case an elemental molar carbon to nitrogen ratio of c n 1 25 1 was calculated to be necessary for complete denitrification assuming all the carbon was consumed for nitrate reduction expressing the carbon as acetate for convenience the ideal molar ratio becomes cac n 0 62 1 in practice the necessary cac n ratio for nitrate removal has been reported to be in the range of 1 3 to 1 8 gierczak et al 2007 because acetate may be consumed in processes other than nitrate reduction critchley et al 2014 conservatively adjusted the ratio upward to as much as cac n 2 8 another factor governing the effectiveness of the cis is the velocity of the groundwater gierczak et al 2007 reported this dependency following variations in municipal well pumping rates near a cis operation critchley et al 2014 observed a similar effect caused by variations in ambient groundwater velocities exacerbated by sediment heterogeneity in portions of the aquifer where seepage velocities were less than 1 m d denitrification led to essentially complete nitrate removal in portions of the aquifer where the velocity exceeded 10 m d nitrate removal was minimal over a downgradient distance of 5 m from the injection wells a likely contributing reason for the dependency of denitrification on groundwater velocity is the inhibiting influence of do which increases in flux with increasing groundwater velocity these do fluxes could also have depressed the initial denitrification activity in the high velocity portions of the treatment zone causing a lag time before nitrate reduction rates were measurable in addition reduced residence times within the monitored portion of the reaction zone may also have limited nitrate reduction rate within the treatment zone though microbially induced aerobic transformations of acetate are expected to be rapid half lives in the range of minutes to hours van beelen et al 2011 from the above discussion the possibility of inducing in situ denitrification in an aquifer depends on three primary factors 1 the presence of denitrifying bacteria 2 the availability of a suitable electron donor 3 a flow regime that permits microbial growth and the development of an anaerobic environment an enormous body of research has focused on aspects of the first two challenges and has established that denitrifiers are commonly present and able to use a variety of electron donors for denitrification soares 2000 devlin et al 2000 where electron donors are absent or scarce they can be provided as part of a remediation scheme of particular difficulty is the delivery of the electron donor s to the denitrifying bacteria well mixed with the nitrate contamination this requirement relies on subsurface mixing that is a generally weak phenomenon in this work the cis was selected to address the third criterion on the strength of its performance in four previous field tests devlin and barker 1996 devlin et al 2004 gierczak et al 2007 critchley et al 2014 3 site description the field study site is located within county of oxford ontario approximately six kilometers south of the city of woodstock fig 1 the field area sits within 111 ha of farmland purchased by the county of oxford in 2003 this land was acquired as part of an overall program to manage nitrate concentrations in the municipal supply wells the land is currently rented back to farmers with restrictions placed on the amount of fertilizer that can be applied and the cropping practices in order to reduce excess nitrogen leaching to groundwater near this well field bekeris 2007 the county of oxford manages the woodstock water system which consists of ten wells situated in several well fields the largest of these well fields is referred to as the thornton well field and is situated several kilometers south of the city of woodstock within an active agricultural landscape fig 1 several of the public supply wells within the thornton well field have exhibited nitrate concentrations close to or above the canadian water quality guidelines 10 mg l n no3 the nitrate concentrations in these wells have shown a chronic rise since the 1970s which is considered to be due to continuous crop farming in the area bekeris 2007 rudolph et al 2015 the geological materials underlying the site comprise up to 70 m of quaternary aged glacial sediments deposited in an interlobate zone between the broadly nw trending ontario basin lobe and se trending huron georgian bay lobe in the winsconsinan glacial episode krzyszkowski and karrow 2001 the interlobate zone is characterized by an overall mixing of sediments and the production of mixed and discontinuous sedimentary units glaciofluvial outwash deposits make up a relatively small percentage of the surficial geology in the study area cowan 1975 but are critical to this investigation because they may represent a major pathway for nitrate migration in the subsurface haslauer 2005 this is due to their permeable nature and their close proximity to and connection with the main production aquifer units where the municipal wells of the thornton well field are installed the glaciofluvial sediments can be highly heterogeneous and discontinuous in nature the field study site is situated within the glaciofluvial sediments approximately 300 m northwest of the thornton well field fig 1 the hydrostratigraphic sequence at the study area comprises four distinguishable aquifers overlying bedrock which is also used as an aquifer within the region fig 2a the current study was conducted in the upper three aquifers where the public supply wells have been completed these aquifer units were found to consist of a stratified sequence of sand and gravel layers underlain by a clay aquitard at approximately 283 masl total depth of approximately 18 m that effectively confines the lower two aquifers fig 2b detailed hydraulic analysis of the aquifer materials below the water table completed by critchley 2010 and presented in critchley et al 2014 revealed a permeable six layer system with hydraulic conductivity values varying by several orders of magnitude between them a thin gravel layer at about 290 masl represents the most permeable stratum in the sequence fig 2b in the area of the study the three overburden aquifers are hydraulically connected however within a few hundred meters up gradient and down gradient of the study site the aquifers become isolated from each other by clay strata fig 2a background nitrate levels throughout the 18 m thickness of unconfined aquifer are near or in excess of the maximum concentration limits mcls except in the top few meters of aquifer 1 fig 2 for example background nitrate concentrations were found to average 4 7 mg n l within layers 1 and 2 fig 2b but had an average concentration of 13 1 mg n l in layer 6 4 methods the cis system was established with the installation of two screened wells to serve as an injection extraction well pair the extraction well ew wo78 and the injection well iw wo79 were located 5 m apart on a line perpendicular to the regional groundwater flow direction fig 1 these wells were constructed using 50 8 mm diameter 10 slot pvc screens and schedule 40 pvc riser pipe the screens were 10 67 m wo78 and 9 14 m long wo79 and terminated at a depth of about 3 m below the water table it should be noted that due to the broad nature of the injected tracer cloud and the use of monitoring locations aligned along only one flow path downstream of the cis system it was not possible to calculate a complete mass balance of the species of interest within the treatment zone acetate as sodium acetate ch3coona and a tracer sodium bromide were introduced to the aquifer from the cis and monitored at several multilevel bundles aligned parallel to the regional flow direction between one and five meters down gradient fig 1 the acetate solution was introduced to the aquifer over 6 h injection periods at 0 2 l min on a daily basis for 55 days well wo78 was equipped with 8 slot insert screens to ensure sufficient back pressure to cause an even distribution of acetate solution over the length of the well which was constructed with a 10 slot screen as mentioned above see results and shaw 2012 extraction well wo79 was pumped at 0 2 l min to match the injection rate at wo778 acetate was injected at 260 mg l cac n 4 5 1 multilevel ml5 was located 1 m from the cis well pair wo78 and wo79 and ml7 was located 5 m from the cis each bundle consisted of seven individual 10 cm screens located at 1 7 m intervals with the deepest points at elevations of 287 masl ml5 and 288 masl ml7 the screen tips were located at the end of 9 5 mm internal diameter id polyethylene tubes tied to a central 12 7 mm id pvc pipe and were fabricated from slotted 9 5 mm id polyethylene tubing wrapped in fine nitex screen samples for laboratory analysis were collected in 25 ml scintillation vials and frozen to inhibit biological activity analyses of nitrate nitrite acetate and bromide were performed on thawed stirred samples using a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatograph with a dionex ionpac as18 analytical column duplicate samples or field blanks were collected and analyzed approximately every thirty samples do levels were measured in the field during each groundwater sampling campaign using a digital vwr symphony sp70d meter with a do probe measurements were made after purging of the sampling line at least three line volumes to ensure do associated with standing water in the lines was removed prior to the measurements groundwater velocity v estimates were obtained in four ways first site wide seepage velocities were calculated using average porosity θ regional gradient values i and hydraulic conductivity values k from slug tests darcy s law was applied to obtain a specific discharge for the site q 5 q ki θ 6 v q θ second velocities were obtained from depth specific tracer testing the bromide tracer tests were conducted by including sodium bromide salt in the acetate injection water two tracer tests were conducted one in july 2011 and the second in september 2011 the first introduced 314 mg l bromide ion and the second 340 mg l bromide ion the two tests yielded comparable results in the form of similar breakthrough curves at the ml5 and ml7 monitoring points so only the first tracer test is discussed in the following section the bromide breakthrough curves were fit at each multilevel monitoring point on ml5 and ml7 with a 1d solution to the advection dispersion equation as described by critchley et al 2014 from these fits the effective seepage velocity from the cis transect between the injection and pumping wells to the monitoring point were determined third depth specific hydraulic conductivity values fig 2b back calculated from the bromide tracer velocity data combined with average porosity and gradient values were used to estimate depth specific velocities this was the approach used by critchley et al 2014 to create the 6 layer hydrostratigraphic model for the site fourth seepage velocities were measured with point velocity probes pvps at selected depths using pvps pvp3 pvp4 installed as multilevel stands adjacent to the water sampling multilevel ml bundles ml5 and ml7 respectively see fig 1 devlin et al 2009 a pvp is a device placed between lengths of plastic well casing that dispenses small volumes of either saline or deionized water tracer on its outer surface groundwater carries the tracer over wire detectors connected to a datalogger the detector signals record breakthrough curves from which groundwater velocity can be determined labaky et al 2007 the pvps used in this work were previously used by schillig et al 2016 they were installed as multilevel arrays of seven probes per stand the probes were positioned on the stands to permit them to measure velocities across the 16 m deep section of aquifer spanning the 6 hydrostratigraphic units described by critchley et al 2014 with particular focus on layer 4 which had previously been identified as a stratum characterized by high flow rates fig 2 the pvps were fabricated from 3d printed plastic bodies and stainless steel detector wires connected to the surface via cat5 cable devlin et al 2009 walter and devlin 2017 the tracer solution used in the pvp tests consisted of solutions ranging from deionized water to a 0 07 g l nacl solution in site groundwater establishing a tracer specific conductance measurably different from the ambient groundwater and a similar solution density injected tracer volumes ranged from 1 ml to 10 mls depending on the observed responses the great majority of tests were conducted at the lower end of this range the probes were designed to sense both horizontal and vertical flow gibson and devlin 2018 data were collected from all pvps daily for one month prior to the acetate injection phase to document the background flow conditions after acetate additions were underway velocity data were gathered from about half the pvps and limited to times between acetate injections to prevent biases introduced by pumping the data were analyzed with the open source software velprobepe schillig 2012 https www people ku edu jfdevlin software html velprobepe 5 results and discussion 5 1 hydrogeology the most comprehensive water level dataset from the woodstock site was presented by critchley 2010 appendix d for the year 2008 water levels were gathered every month over a period of a year from which it was possible to determine that the hydraulic gradient ranged between 2 07 10 3 and 8 62 10 3 and flow directions varied between southward and northeastward see fig 3b with the predominant flow direction to the east southeast devlin and schillig 2017 found that the water level data from the w075s well may have been influenced by a slow response time or a poor hydraulic connection and that without these data the water flow direction was more uniformly to the southeast schillig et al 2016 reported a representative k for the site of 1 54 10 3 m s based on slug testing in wells wo75s wo74s and wo74d using this value and an average gradient of 0 0045 assuming n 0 3 the overall seepage velocity across the site is estimated to be 2 m d using an average k of 7 5 10 3 m s estimated using the depth discrete 6 layer model of critchley 2010 note all k values in that model were back calculated from velocities estimated from bromide tracer test results the seepage velocity across the site is calculated to be 9 7 m d this higher estimate of velocity is representative of the local area where treatment was occurring where the bromide tracer test was conducted ambient groundwater seepage velocities were also determined with pvps in june and july 2011 schillig 2012 and in november 2011 fig 4a b the summer 2011 survey revealed flow predominantly to the southeast with an average flow that was essentially horizontal mean and median angles were 4o downward and 0o respectively though local flows could deviate from this bulk behavior the november 2011 data were collected in late fall and revealed an eastward shift in the ambient flow direction flow was again near horizontal on average mean and median angles were 9o upward and 0o respectively with locally variable vertical components the minor upward shift in mean flow direction was not significant at the 0 05 level p value 0 163 the distributions of velocity magnitudes were similarly skewed in 2010 and 2011 though the range was somewhat larger in the later dataset with medians shifting upward from about 2 7 m d to 4 7 m d the point measurements pvps indicated that in the area of testing flow was predominantly to the southeast and overall occurring at a rate about half the 6 layer darcy estimate fig 4 despite the differences and considering that typical uncertainties in darcy based velocity values may be up to an order of magnitude the estimated velocities determined here are considered to be reasonably consistent between methods especially at elevation 290 masl where a high permeability stratum is consistently present as discussed below the depth specific patterns of local flow in the treatment zone was first elucidated with the pvps and later confirmed with an independent bromide tracer test critchley 2010 critchley et al 2014 schillig et al 2016 fig 5 the aquifer was found to contain a stratum at elevations in the range of 288 to 290 m above sea level masl in which the seepage velocity was anomalously high i e 10 m d the pvp measurements conducted in november 2011 returned very similar spatial trends with depth compared to the summer months 2011 demonstrating reproducibility though the flow at the pvp4 location was higher by a factor of about 2 in the later survey factors including variations in background flow or variations in the rates of pumping at the nearby municipal wells might have contributed to these differences although the bromide tracer test conducted in 2011 independently confirmed the presence of the high flow stratum the horizontal separations of the pvps and multilevel monitoring wells did reveal some minor variations in the depths of the high velocity strata fig 5 the velocity data presented in fig 5 are important for two reasons first they demonstrate reproducibility of point velocity measurement trends over time and independent measurement methods second they establish zones in the aquifer where water flux is higher than expected using more conventional approaches both of these reasons attest to the importance of the heterogeneity and flow variability at the site the significance of this finding for designing and executing an in situ treatment program is discussed in detail in the sections that follow 5 2 geochemistry and effect of acetate injections the groundwater at the study site can be categorized as freshwater with total dissolved solids of about 600 mg l dominated by calcium and bicarbonate ions the average ph of the groundwater was found to be 7 35 prior to the introduction of acetate the aquifer was aerobic throughout its depth dissolved oxygen in the range of 8 to 13 mg l with a nitrate concentration of about 14 mg l n no3 everywhere except the shallowest depths elev 297 masl where the concentrations were about 5 mg l n no3 figs 2 and 6 daily samples were collected for the analysis of do nitrate and nitrate transformations products and acetate prior to turning the system on and after the nitrate treatment was in progress occasional samples were also collected for major ions as well as iron and manganese no notable changes from background were observed in any of these additional ionic parameters so the following analysis focusses on the daily sampled species as discussed in the introduction section denitrification is the process of transforming nitrate to dinitrogen gas and is mediated by ubiquitous microorganisms called denitrifiers prior work at this site critchley et al 2014 and a nearby site devlin et al 2000 found strong evidence that the dominant mechanism for nitrate reduction was denitrification therefore the geochemical characterization performed here was aimed at tracking denitrification through the primary active species nitrate nitrite for risk evaluation purposes and the electron donor supplied to the aquifer acetate within natural groundwater systems other nitrate transformation processes can influence the fate of nitrate including but not limited to autotrophic denitrification dnra or anammox due to the considerable previous laboratory and field evidence that denitrification was the dominant transformation process in the current study environment the other processes were not considered or tracked throughout the field experiments reported here denitrifiers are facultative anaerobes i e they can thrive in either aerobic or anaerobic environments in anaerobic environments they switch their preferred electron acceptor from do to nitrate thereby initiating denitrification it is commonly held that do concentrations should be less than 0 5 mg l for denitrification to proceed e g tesoriero and puckett 2011 trudell et al 1986 bradley et al 1992 however wolters et al 2022 cited several studies showing denitrification in sediments where the do concentrations were in the range of 1 to 2 mg l or greater therefore in addition to the primary species listed above do was monitored regularly to verify the expected association between oxygen and nitrate disappearances to establish the redox conditions for denitrification acetate was repeatedly introduced to the aquifer over 6 h injection periods at 0 2 l min in accordance with the pulsed nature of a cis the spiked groundwater was introduced into well wo79 while water was being extracted from w078 at the same rate critchley et al 2014 performed similar injections with 135 mg l acetate establishing a cac n ratio in the treatment zone of 2 8 1 they found that in all but three monitored elevations nitrate could be removed to levels below the regulatory limit of 10 mg l n no3 if the injections were repeated on a daily basis the depths where nitrate remained above the regulatory limits elev 290 to 202 masl at ml5 all corresponded to depths where the seepage velocities exceeded 10 m d based on the bromide tracer test and point velocity measured values exceeded about 7 m d schillig et al 2016 this established the importance of hydrogeology as a third factor after acetate presence and nitrate disappearance for the success of the cis to address the problem of uneven flow the acetate source concentration in the current work was increased to 260 mg l cac n 4 5 1 to more aggressively promote nitrate reduction in the strata with the highest seepage velocities an examination of the profiles of nitrate and do after the onset of the acetate injections reveals noteworthy declines in both substances throughout the aquifer at ml5 and ml7 notably the nitrate concentrations fell consistently below the regulatory limit at ml7 with minimal appearance of nitrite fig 6 the concentration profiles show a good positive correlation between do and nitrate both are depleted but display relative maxima at similar depths consistent with expectations for a denitrifying system moreover the highest concentrations of do and nitrate correspond to either depths were seepage velocities were relatively high see bromide tracer test velocities fig 5 elev 290 to 292 masl at ml5 and elev 284 292 to 294 at ml7 or depths not reached by the acetate injections due in part to the injection and extraction well screen depth ranges e g elev 298 masl at ml5 and 284 masl at ml7 see also fig 2b these results further support the conclusions that declines in nitrate concentration were due to nitrate reduction likely denitrification and that groundwater velocity was a primary factor controlling nitrate treatment within the treatment zone i e from the cis well pair to ml7 the prior work reported by critchley et al 2014 demonstrated the effectiveness of the cis at removing nitrate from groundwater with acetate injections over a 26 day period first 11 days on a 24 h cycle of injections and the following 15 days on a 48 h cycle in addition critchley et al 2014 showed that at the woodstock site bi daily injections of acetate were insufficient to drive nitrate below regulatory limits over the full vertical extent of the treatment zone in the current study daily injections were maintained for 55 days to demonstrate a longer term of treatment that would sustain the desired amounts of nitrate removal from the groundwater the success of this endeavor is demonstrated in the time series of acetate do and nitrate at ml5 and ml7 figs 7 8 9 nitrate was reduced to levels below the target of 10 mg l n no3 at all monitored depths where acetate was delivered above 50 mg l in a sustained way the delivery of acetate to the aquifer is the first step in creating the do depletion necessary for denitrification the cis sustained concentrations between 20 mg l and 200 mg l everywhere in the treatment zone except the shallowest and deepest monitored locations ml5 1 and ml7 7 respectively fig 7 the highest concentrations of acetate were observed at ml5 3 ml5 4 and ml5 5 150 to 200 mg l corresponding to elevations near the middle of the injection screen and zones of relatively high seepage velocities the contrast in acetate concentrations with depth was more muted at ml7 but the highest concentrations occurred at about the same elevations at ml7 1 ml7 2 ml7 3 and ml7 4 the lowest acetate concentrations occurred at ml5 1 because this location was above the elevation of the top of the injection and extraction well screens fig 2b in response to the above perturbations do concentrations declined from background levels 8 to 13 mg l to 5 mg l as acetate was aerobically consumed everywhere except ml5 1 and ml7 7 with the majority of samples exhibiting do concentrations 2 mg l by day 55 day zero being the onset of acetate injections fig 8 this evidence strongly supports the association of acetate delivery and stimulated microbial activity in the aquifer although the aquifer was not taken to a complete and uniform anaerobic condition it was likely rendered locally anoxic since notable declines in nitrate occurred contemporaneously with the acetate and do concentration changes discussed in detail below fig 9 this redox environment is beneficial for two reasons first it is evidently sufficient to promote and sustain denitrification second it is not so anaerobic that iron and manganese in the aquifer sediments will be reduced and dissolved in the groundwater this helps avoid the possibility of iron and manganese oxide precipitation on well screens in the treatment zone or in the municipal wells it is noted that the increased supply of acetate in this work compared to the work of critchley et al 2014 to address the high nitrate fluxes in the strata between 288 and 292 masl resulted in acetate persisting through the treatment zone at concentrations nominally between 50 mg l and 100 mg l this carbon flux is in excess of the do and nitrate fluxes and raises the possibility that a more reducing environment could develop further down gradient from the treatment zone however in this system much of the excess acetate is expected to be consumed as treated groundwater mixes with ambient groundwater before reaching the municipal wells several hundred meters down gradient in a full scale system the delivery of acetate would not have to be as uniformly delivered through the section as was done in this study higher acetate fluxes would be established in the higher permeability strata and lower acetate fluxes established in the less permeable strata thus in a full scale system the excess acetate could be minimized monitoring of nitrate in the treatment zone groundwater revealed a decline to levels below the regulatory limit of 10 mg l n no3 by day 20 at most monitored locations as previously mentioned the locations where nitrate persisted were ml5 1 ml5 4 ml5 5 and ml7 7 in the cases of ml5 4 and ml5 5 both acetate delivery and do depletion were observed therefore it is concluded that at those locations the controlling factor for denitrification was hydrogeological this conclusion is strengthened since these depths corresponded to seepage velocities in excess of 10 m d at ml7 7 groundwater velocities approached 20 m d fig 5 and acetate delivery was variable fig 7 both of these factors likely contributed to the sustained n no3 concentrations 10 mg l the occurrence of n no3 at high concentrations at ml5 1 was remarkable because the background levels of nitrate at that location were undetectable prior to the acetate injections nitrate concentrations rose steadily over the test period until by day 36 the concentrations exceeded 10 mg l the possibility of chemical or microbial sources of the observed nitrate at ml5 1 can be ruled out since there was no source of reduced nitrogen that could have been oxidized to nitrate at that depth upgradient of the sampling point therefore once again the change in nitrate concentration is likely attributable to hydrogeological causes in this case it is hypothesized that the nitrate was transported untransformed from deeper locations due to an altered hydraulic conductivity distribution following biostimulation and subsequent vertical flow redirection pvp3 was located proximal to ml5 an examination of the vertical flow direction at pvp3 reveals an overall shift upward following the acetate injections prior to biostimulation the average aggregate vertical flow angle at pvp3 was 9o upward and afterwards it changed to 45o upward fig 10 this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that nitrate at ml5 1 was driven by flow redirection however the changes in flow are more complex at the scale of the individual probes the depths associated with upward flow redirection corresponded to probes pvp3 3 pvp3 5 and pvp3 7 pvp3 1 exhibited upward flow both before and after biostimulation these probes were located at depths considerably below ml5 1 the heterogeneity of the aquifer the offset in locations between pvp3 and ml5 and the possibility of local horizontal flow redirection between pvp3 and ml5 all confound the interpretation of flow sensed by the individual probes the aggregate behavior may therefore be the best indicator of the flow changes responsible for the nitrate transport to ml5 1 albeit indirect 5 3 assessment of treatment performance critchley et al 2014 and critchley 2010 recommended that a longer term test be conducted with daily injections to replicate their findings and demonstrate the viability of longer term treatment they reported a 21 mass removal of nitrate from the groundwater flowing through the treatment zone which they considered unexpectedly high considering the high groundwater velocities encountered in the current work daily injections were performed continuously for 55 days nitrate fluxes were estimated at ml7 which is the furthest monitor downgradient of the injection extraction well pair of the cis table 1 for the purposes of these calculations direct velocity measurements made with pvps and darcy estimates of seepage velocity based on the critchley et al 6 layer model were used to estimate nitrate removal rates the pvp velocities were collected from selected depths and did not extend vertically over the entire treated portion of aquifer so the darcy calculations were performed to provide a complete vertical representation of the aquifer the darcy derived seepage velocities were calculated using the k values reported by critchley et al 2014 eq 7 an average site hydraulic gradient of 3 33 10 3 i and an estimated porosity of θ 0 33 based on the dominantly sandy and gravelly components of the sediments were used in the calculations the darcy derived velocities were calculated through 7 v ki θ where k is hydraulic conductivity ml 1 θ is porosity the velocity values determined this way were compared with the direct velocity measurements at nearby pvp4 and also with the nitrate concentrations measured at ml7 tables 1 and 2 nitrate flux was calculated according to eq 8 8 j q c aq where j is the mass flux of nitrate and c aq is the aqueous concentration of nitrate ml3 q is the water flux q ki for the darcy estimates and q vθ for the pvp based estimates the flux values for each layer can be combined to determine the mass discharge of nitrate through an area a l2 corresponding to the 6 layers 14 6 m vertically and the 5 m separation distance δy between the cis wells w078 and w079 eq 9 9 md i 1 n q i a i c aq i using previously unpublished data from critchley 2010 it was estimated that the mass discharge of nitrate through the treatment zone was 1145 g n d prior to the 11 day acetate injection period after the injection period the mass discharge rate declined to 902 g n d a 21 decline table 2 the calculations were repeated using data collected in the current work before and after the 55 day period of daily acetate injections the mass discharge before treatment began was calculated to be 1063 g n d the post treatment mass discharge was found to be 392 g n d a 63 decline table 2 the decline was similarly estimated to be 43 using the pvp derived velocities the lack of complete vertical coverage by the pvps no doubt contributed to the lower nitrate reduction estimate but given the low nitrate attenuation at the shallowest depths as indicated by the darcy calculations in table 2 the difference may indicate that the darcy calculations somewhat overestimated the treatment rate paradoxically the pvp calculations indicate greater absolute nitrate mass discharges and nitrate mass treated despite the lower removal percentages this unintuitive outcome is a direct result of the flow rates used in the calculations and emphasizes the importance of making velocity determinations as accurately as possible also in both cases the nitrate removal rate was notably improved in this work compared to the earlier trials by critchley et al 2014 critchley 2010 considered the 21 nitrate removal that was observed in the 11 day test was a near best case result for practical purposes the range of depths exhibiting high groundwater flow in the treatment zone was a major limiting factor on performance in the current work the duration of the acetate injections was extended from 11 to 55 days affording the microbial populations additional time to stabilize also the c ac n ratio targeted for the treatment zone was increased from 2 8 to 4 5 to ensure adequate delivery of the acetate to the high velocity strata these measures led to the 43 to 63 level of nitrate removal from the groundwater adding support to the findings of critchley 2010 and demonstrating the viability of the in situ method of nitrate reduction in aquifers a final concern raised in critchley et al 2014 was that nitrite or iron production could accompany the reduction of nitrate the occurrence of nitrite was found to be potentially problematic in locations where groundwater velocities were fastest in the current work nitrite production was only observed above the regulatory limit of 1 mg l n no2 prior to day 10 of the treatment after that time nitrite remained below the maximum allowable concentrations in all monitored locations including those where groundwater velocities were in excess of 10 m d fig 11 neither iron nor manganese concentrations were found to increase notably above background levels probably because do levels remained above 0 5 mg l see chapelle et al 1995 at all monitored multilevel locations throughout most of the experiment with the exceptions of four isolated samples between days 26 and 42 at ml5 6 7 and ml7 1 7 6 implications critchley et al 2014 demonstrated the viability of the cis for in situ treatment of nitrate near a municipal water supply however they noted that the treatment was not complete in zones where the groundwater exhibited seepage velocities of several meters per day the current work demonstrates that nitrate can be treated in these problematic zones by increasing the supply of electron donor in the form of acetate this was achieved without driving the aquifer to a completely anaerobic condition and chemically reducing secondary species such as iron manganese or sulfate within the treatment zone it is noted that acetate was delivered in excess throughout the aquifer section and migrated out of the treatment zone at concentrations that could cause secondary water quality problems down gradient therefore in full scale systems a more targeted acetate delivery system is recommended in such a scheme higher acetate concentrations could be delivered to the strata experiencing the highest nitrate fluxes and lower acetate concentrations delivered to other portions of the aquifer these findings justify a scaled up test with the capability of meaningfully altering the nitrate flux to a municipal well the challenges of such a scale up will be to design the cis to treat enough of the municipal well capture zone to affect a decline in nitrate concentrations in the well as demonstrated in this work a major concern in that scaled up design will be to characterize the flow system adequately so that all major pathways for nitrate mass in the capture zone are taken into account when the cis design is prepared 7 conclusions an important conclusion of this work is that the hydrogeology of the site is a primary factor in determining the success or failure of in situ denitrification in aquifers where denitrifying bacteria are naturally present the importance of high definition aquifer characterization cannot be understated as exemplified at this site this insight was strongly suggested in prior work but the extended treatment time in the current work showed with no ambiguity that the high velocity zones of the aquifer were the ones that posed the greatest challenges for nitrate removal and nitrite accumulation direct velocity measurements using the pvps were applied in a complimentary fashion with a bromide tracer test and later darcy calculations were necessary to provide independent and conclusive evidence for the magnitudes and depths of strata exhibiting problematic flow rates as was noted by schillig 2012 a combination of characterization methods was essential for the successful design of the in situ treatment system it is further noted that the nitrate removal rates indicated by the direct velocity measurements was lower than those calculated from the darcy estimates of velocity but paradoxically the total masses of nitrate removed were higher this finding highlights the potential importance of obtaining the most reliable seepage velocity measurements possible when assessing treatment performance it is further concluded from this work that with proper characterization of the aquifer the cis is a viable in situ treatment method for groundwater contaminated with nitrate it was shown here that even in highly heterogeneous sediments with groundwater velocities varying over an order of magnitude sustained nitrate removal rates near 50 are possible to achieve higher levels of treatment might reasonably be expected in less heterogeneous aquifers moreover with lateral expansion of the well pair system it may be possible to remove a greater mass of nitrate from the groundwater supplying the municipal wells related to the heterogeneity is the wide range of oxygen flux throughout the treatment zone profile oxygen can interfere with denitrification so high oxygen fluxes can limit an in situ denitrification system s performance this was shown to be the case in the work of critchley et al 2014 at the woodstock site the sustained daily injections of acetate 55 days at an enhanced concentration 260 mg l up from 135 mg l were shown to be sufficient to treat nitrate to below regulatory limits with no adverse effects of nitrite production within the treatment zone this extends the work of critchley et al 2014 and demonstrates the robustness and flexibility of the cis method it is also concluded that a cis program can be designed for high rates of nitrate removal without nitrite accumulation with carbon to nitrogen ratios c ac n up to 4 5 which is about seven times the stoichiometric requirement assuming all carbon is used for nitrogen reduction lower ratios might be possible to use in less heterogeneous aquifers the excess carbon supplied in this project did not take the aquifer to fully anoxic conditions nevertheless denitrification was apparently stimulated with minimal nitrite accumulation a side benefit of the redox conditions achieved was that excess reduced manganese and iron were not produced this should minimize well maintenance within the cis wells due to metal oxide precipitation on screens based on prior work at this site and nearby this study was undertaken on the premise that nitrate reduction in response to acetate injections to the aquifer occurred primarily by denitrification although this premise is well supported by earlier research additional work to test the premise at this site is recommended credit authorship contribution statement j shaw formal

1202,elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations have been linked to deleterious health and environmental effects a significant source of the nitrate is nitrogen fertilizers applied to agricultural landscapes beneficial management practices bmps including the optimization of fertilizer use and selective crop rotations have proven to be effective in some cases the city of woodstock in southern ontario relies on public wells for all of its municipal supply several of the wells have experienced chronic increases in nitrate concentrations exceeding the maximum allowable limit of 10 mg l n no3 while bmps are established an interim reduction plan based on enhanced in situ denitrification cross injection system cis in a 15 m thick zone of high nitrate mass flux within the aquifer zone was evaluated based in the results of preliminary acetate injection experiments a c n ratio of 2 35 approximately 260 mg acetate l was selected to optimize the denitrification reaction injections were performed for six hours a day every day for a period of approximately two months dissolved oxygen do and nitrate concentrations recorded over time indicated that reduction of both commenced within a few days of the beginning of the acetate injections and reduced levels were maintained for the remainder of the two month injection period denitrification occurred throughout the profile although nitrate reduction was the highest in the lower groundwater velocity zones an overall reduction of nitrate of 50 was achieved through the treated section of the aquifer it is estimated that an upscaled treatment system utilizing a treatment width of only 70 m would be sufficient to reduce the nitrate concentrations to below the drinking water limit demonstrating the potential for the cis method to functions as an interim groundwater nitrate reduction strategy keywords groundwater nitrate public supply wells beneficial management practices enhanced denitrification interim treatment cross injection system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrate is regulated in drinking water due to suspected links between human consumption and adverse health effects including methaemoglobinaemia johnson et al 1987 gelberg et al 1999 knobeloch et al 2000 and adult cancers ward et al 2010 rising trends in nitrate contamination in groundwater supplies have been attributed in part to diffuse pollution from farming and changes in land use since the mid twentieth century which has involved the long term land application of fertilizers canter 1997 with an increasing global demand for food maximizing crop production through the extensive use of fertilizers including nitrogen is anticipated to remain a common worldwide issue these sources of groundwater contamination have proven very challenging to address in part because the non point source nature of the source confounds treatment focused on a well defined and manageable site the preferred long term option for overcoming the above challenge is the adoption of so called best management practices bmp which aim to change agricultural practices such as increasing the efficiency of fertilizer application and crop choices world health organization 2007 crop nutrients council 2009 however the legacy of decades of excess nitrate loadings to the ground is a reservoir of nitrate in the subsurface above and below the water table that will likely take decades to deplete regardless of when and where nutrient bmps are implemented cole 2008 honisch et al 2002 meissner et al 2002 tomer and burkart 2003 wassenaar et al 2006 kim et al 2021 in the meantime the nitrate reservoir in soil and aquifers poses a threat to drinking water supplies that rely upon groundwater one alternative for resolving this problem is to treat the nitrate in the groundwater at surface when it is pumped from ground in general this alternative is limited by the expense of building and maintaining treatment facilities when the affected communities served are small for example the groundwater at hyawatha ks a town of about 3300 people exceeded the regulatory limit of 10 mg l n no3 in 2017 that town installed a water treatment plant at a cost of 3 5 m clay 2018 a second alternative is to treat the water in situ before it is pumped for this option to be viable one strategy is to treat the water relatively close to the supply wells where the convergence of flow reduces the volume of aquifer note the distinction with the volume of groundwater needing treatment the literature presents several schemes for achieving this objective including single well injection of amendments dual well injection systems daisy well systems and permeable reactive barriers gierczak et al 2007 hiscock et al 1991 khan and spalding 2004 schipper and vojvodić vuković 2001 mercado et al 1988 zhao et al 2022 another scheme the cis was designed to establish a curtain of an injectate spiked water between a system of pumping and extraction wells devlin and barker 1994 the injected water is then permitted to migrate under natural gradient conditions downflow from the injection location to support a groundwater treatment zone this method of biostimulation is hydrogeologically driven it places emphasis on knowledge of the ambient flow system and takes advantage of subsurface solution mixing by dispersive mechanisms devlin and barker 1996 devlin et al 2004 gierczak et al 2007 critchley et al 2014 the approach was also independently developed by dybas et al 1998 2002 for the treatment of carbon tetrachloride they explicitly commented on its utility for nitrate removal summarizing work near the town of woodstock ontario canada rudolph et al 2015 noted that in situ denitrification could compliment crop nutrient bmps to solve the problem of elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations in public supply wells over both the short and long terms critchley et al 2014 set out to demonstrate the viability of stimulating enhanced bioremediation of nitrate immediately up gradient of the town s municipal wells a reactive zone was created over an 11 day period of daily injections using the cis to introduce acetate to the aquifer as an amendment to enhance nitrate reduction followed by a 15 day period of bi daily acetate injections critchley et al 2014 schillig et al 2016 based on previous work at a nearby site in the same physiographic region of ontario which used acetylene block experiments to show that denitrification was the principle mechanism of nitrate removal in the presence of acetate devlin et al 2000 nitrate reduction at the current site was accepted as occurring via denitrification in these experiments nitrite production was found to be small in both the laboratory and field tests and limited to the first few days following the onset of nitrate treatment i e the addition of acetate to the systems no ammonium was detected in any of the actively denitrifying sediments in either the laboratory tests or in field samples devlin et al 2000 critchley et al 2014 in addition isotopic evidence that found a fractionation ratio of δ15n o oo δ18o o oo equal to 2 1 1 critchley et al 2014 which has previously been associated with denitrification aravena and robertson 1998 provided further evidence in support of denitrification as the principal process of subsurface nitrate reduction in this type of natural environment the above demonstration established the viability of the cis in this application but also established limitations imposed by the highly heterogeneous nature of the glacial outwash aquifer at the woodstock site the average groundwater velocity was determined to be about 2 m d based on conventional water level surveys but direct velocity measurements and tracer testing revealed a stratum in which velocities reached or exceeded 30 m d at intermediate depths within the injection site which was located within a few hundred meters of the active public supply wells schillig et al 2016 denitrification was not adequately stimulated in the high velocity strata of the treatment zone to remove nitrate from the groundwater as mentioned previously the experiment was about one month long in duration in which daily injections of acetate were maintained for 11 days and bi daily injections for the remainder of the time the period of daily injections produced the strongest denitrification response and a sustained zone of bioremediation was achieved nevertheless questions remained whether or not a longer stimulation period would have achieved denitrification more uniformly throughout the aquifer the possibility that enhanced levels of acetate delivered to the high velocity zones might improve the treatment performance was also suggested by critchley et al 2014 the current study was designed to evaluate the performance of the csi method over an extended time period 55 days of sustained biostimulation and to assess any subsequent improvements in the uniformity of stimulated denitrification in the aquifer following the suggestion of critchley et al 2014 it was also hypothesized that increasing the frequency and concentration of carbon injections as acetate would result in more complete nitrate removal from the aquifer related requirements for the system were that no undesirable levels of biofouling or other types of clogging due to the acetate loadings should be promoted and no production of secondary substances of concern for health such as nitrite or negative aesthetics such as those related to high levels of dissolved iron should occur 2 background denitrification is a natural process in the subsurface that converts nitrate to dinitrogen gas n2 g where acetate is the electron donor supplied to drive the process the sequence of reactions from nitrate to dinitrogen gas is as follows andre et al 2011 1 n o 3 aq 0 25 c h 3 co o aq 0 25 h aq n o 2 aq 0 5 c o 2 aq 0 5 h 2 o 2 n o 2 aq 0 25 c h 3 co o aq 1 25 h aq 0 5 n 2 o g 0 5 c o 2 aq h 2 o 3 0 5 n 2 o g 0 125 c h 3 co o aq 0 125 h aq 0 5 n 2 g 0 25 c o 2 aq 0 25 h 2 o in situ denitrification takes place without intervention under the correct conditions bacteria capable of mediating this process have been reported to be ubiquitous in the subsurface soares 2000 these conditions include low do near neutral ph an active population of denitrifying bacteria and a source of electrons e g organic carbon dissolved hydrogen sulfide minerals robertson and cherry 1992 starr and gillham 1993 rivett et al 2008 singleton et al 2007 knowles 1982 devlin et al 2000 reviewed various electron donors in aquifers that could enable denitrification compared to inorganic sources of electrons acetate was found to be a highly favourable electron donor and was less likely to promote biofouling than other organic substances they summarized the reaction with acetate as 4 5 c h 3 co o aq 8 n o 3 aq 3 h aq 4 n 2 g 10 hc o 3 aq 4 h 2 o l this stoichiometry was the basis for designing the in situ denitrification systems reported by gierczak et al 2007 and critchley et al 2014 in the latter case an elemental molar carbon to nitrogen ratio of c n 1 25 1 was calculated to be necessary for complete denitrification assuming all the carbon was consumed for nitrate reduction expressing the carbon as acetate for convenience the ideal molar ratio becomes cac n 0 62 1 in practice the necessary cac n ratio for nitrate removal has been reported to be in the range of 1 3 to 1 8 gierczak et al 2007 because acetate may be consumed in processes other than nitrate reduction critchley et al 2014 conservatively adjusted the ratio upward to as much as cac n 2 8 another factor governing the effectiveness of the cis is the velocity of the groundwater gierczak et al 2007 reported this dependency following variations in municipal well pumping rates near a cis operation critchley et al 2014 observed a similar effect caused by variations in ambient groundwater velocities exacerbated by sediment heterogeneity in portions of the aquifer where seepage velocities were less than 1 m d denitrification led to essentially complete nitrate removal in portions of the aquifer where the velocity exceeded 10 m d nitrate removal was minimal over a downgradient distance of 5 m from the injection wells a likely contributing reason for the dependency of denitrification on groundwater velocity is the inhibiting influence of do which increases in flux with increasing groundwater velocity these do fluxes could also have depressed the initial denitrification activity in the high velocity portions of the treatment zone causing a lag time before nitrate reduction rates were measurable in addition reduced residence times within the monitored portion of the reaction zone may also have limited nitrate reduction rate within the treatment zone though microbially induced aerobic transformations of acetate are expected to be rapid half lives in the range of minutes to hours van beelen et al 2011 from the above discussion the possibility of inducing in situ denitrification in an aquifer depends on three primary factors 1 the presence of denitrifying bacteria 2 the availability of a suitable electron donor 3 a flow regime that permits microbial growth and the development of an anaerobic environment an enormous body of research has focused on aspects of the first two challenges and has established that denitrifiers are commonly present and able to use a variety of electron donors for denitrification soares 2000 devlin et al 2000 where electron donors are absent or scarce they can be provided as part of a remediation scheme of particular difficulty is the delivery of the electron donor s to the denitrifying bacteria well mixed with the nitrate contamination this requirement relies on subsurface mixing that is a generally weak phenomenon in this work the cis was selected to address the third criterion on the strength of its performance in four previous field tests devlin and barker 1996 devlin et al 2004 gierczak et al 2007 critchley et al 2014 3 site description the field study site is located within county of oxford ontario approximately six kilometers south of the city of woodstock fig 1 the field area sits within 111 ha of farmland purchased by the county of oxford in 2003 this land was acquired as part of an overall program to manage nitrate concentrations in the municipal supply wells the land is currently rented back to farmers with restrictions placed on the amount of fertilizer that can be applied and the cropping practices in order to reduce excess nitrogen leaching to groundwater near this well field bekeris 2007 the county of oxford manages the woodstock water system which consists of ten wells situated in several well fields the largest of these well fields is referred to as the thornton well field and is situated several kilometers south of the city of woodstock within an active agricultural landscape fig 1 several of the public supply wells within the thornton well field have exhibited nitrate concentrations close to or above the canadian water quality guidelines 10 mg l n no3 the nitrate concentrations in these wells have shown a chronic rise since the 1970s which is considered to be due to continuous crop farming in the area bekeris 2007 rudolph et al 2015 the geological materials underlying the site comprise up to 70 m of quaternary aged glacial sediments deposited in an interlobate zone between the broadly nw trending ontario basin lobe and se trending huron georgian bay lobe in the winsconsinan glacial episode krzyszkowski and karrow 2001 the interlobate zone is characterized by an overall mixing of sediments and the production of mixed and discontinuous sedimentary units glaciofluvial outwash deposits make up a relatively small percentage of the surficial geology in the study area cowan 1975 but are critical to this investigation because they may represent a major pathway for nitrate migration in the subsurface haslauer 2005 this is due to their permeable nature and their close proximity to and connection with the main production aquifer units where the municipal wells of the thornton well field are installed the glaciofluvial sediments can be highly heterogeneous and discontinuous in nature the field study site is situated within the glaciofluvial sediments approximately 300 m northwest of the thornton well field fig 1 the hydrostratigraphic sequence at the study area comprises four distinguishable aquifers overlying bedrock which is also used as an aquifer within the region fig 2a the current study was conducted in the upper three aquifers where the public supply wells have been completed these aquifer units were found to consist of a stratified sequence of sand and gravel layers underlain by a clay aquitard at approximately 283 masl total depth of approximately 18 m that effectively confines the lower two aquifers fig 2b detailed hydraulic analysis of the aquifer materials below the water table completed by critchley 2010 and presented in critchley et al 2014 revealed a permeable six layer system with hydraulic conductivity values varying by several orders of magnitude between them a thin gravel layer at about 290 masl represents the most permeable stratum in the sequence fig 2b in the area of the study the three overburden aquifers are hydraulically connected however within a few hundred meters up gradient and down gradient of the study site the aquifers become isolated from each other by clay strata fig 2a background nitrate levels throughout the 18 m thickness of unconfined aquifer are near or in excess of the maximum concentration limits mcls except in the top few meters of aquifer 1 fig 2 for example background nitrate concentrations were found to average 4 7 mg n l within layers 1 and 2 fig 2b but had an average concentration of 13 1 mg n l in layer 6 4 methods the cis system was established with the installation of two screened wells to serve as an injection extraction well pair the extraction well ew wo78 and the injection well iw wo79 were located 5 m apart on a line perpendicular to the regional groundwater flow direction fig 1 these wells were constructed using 50 8 mm diameter 10 slot pvc screens and schedule 40 pvc riser pipe the screens were 10 67 m wo78 and 9 14 m long wo79 and terminated at a depth of about 3 m below the water table it should be noted that due to the broad nature of the injected tracer cloud and the use of monitoring locations aligned along only one flow path downstream of the cis system it was not possible to calculate a complete mass balance of the species of interest within the treatment zone acetate as sodium acetate ch3coona and a tracer sodium bromide were introduced to the aquifer from the cis and monitored at several multilevel bundles aligned parallel to the regional flow direction between one and five meters down gradient fig 1 the acetate solution was introduced to the aquifer over 6 h injection periods at 0 2 l min on a daily basis for 55 days well wo78 was equipped with 8 slot insert screens to ensure sufficient back pressure to cause an even distribution of acetate solution over the length of the well which was constructed with a 10 slot screen as mentioned above see results and shaw 2012 extraction well wo79 was pumped at 0 2 l min to match the injection rate at wo778 acetate was injected at 260 mg l cac n 4 5 1 multilevel ml5 was located 1 m from the cis well pair wo78 and wo79 and ml7 was located 5 m from the cis each bundle consisted of seven individual 10 cm screens located at 1 7 m intervals with the deepest points at elevations of 287 masl ml5 and 288 masl ml7 the screen tips were located at the end of 9 5 mm internal diameter id polyethylene tubes tied to a central 12 7 mm id pvc pipe and were fabricated from slotted 9 5 mm id polyethylene tubing wrapped in fine nitex screen samples for laboratory analysis were collected in 25 ml scintillation vials and frozen to inhibit biological activity analyses of nitrate nitrite acetate and bromide were performed on thawed stirred samples using a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatograph with a dionex ionpac as18 analytical column duplicate samples or field blanks were collected and analyzed approximately every thirty samples do levels were measured in the field during each groundwater sampling campaign using a digital vwr symphony sp70d meter with a do probe measurements were made after purging of the sampling line at least three line volumes to ensure do associated with standing water in the lines was removed prior to the measurements groundwater velocity v estimates were obtained in four ways first site wide seepage velocities were calculated using average porosity θ regional gradient values i and hydraulic conductivity values k from slug tests darcy s law was applied to obtain a specific discharge for the site q 5 q ki θ 6 v q θ second velocities were obtained from depth specific tracer testing the bromide tracer tests were conducted by including sodium bromide salt in the acetate injection water two tracer tests were conducted one in july 2011 and the second in september 2011 the first introduced 314 mg l bromide ion and the second 340 mg l bromide ion the two tests yielded comparable results in the form of similar breakthrough curves at the ml5 and ml7 monitoring points so only the first tracer test is discussed in the following section the bromide breakthrough curves were fit at each multilevel monitoring point on ml5 and ml7 with a 1d solution to the advection dispersion equation as described by critchley et al 2014 from these fits the effective seepage velocity from the cis transect between the injection and pumping wells to the monitoring point were determined third depth specific hydraulic conductivity values fig 2b back calculated from the bromide tracer velocity data combined with average porosity and gradient values were used to estimate depth specific velocities this was the approach used by critchley et al 2014 to create the 6 layer hydrostratigraphic model for the site fourth seepage velocities were measured with point velocity probes pvps at selected depths using pvps pvp3 pvp4 installed as multilevel stands adjacent to the water sampling multilevel ml bundles ml5 and ml7 respectively see fig 1 devlin et al 2009 a pvp is a device placed between lengths of plastic well casing that dispenses small volumes of either saline or deionized water tracer on its outer surface groundwater carries the tracer over wire detectors connected to a datalogger the detector signals record breakthrough curves from which groundwater velocity can be determined labaky et al 2007 the pvps used in this work were previously used by schillig et al 2016 they were installed as multilevel arrays of seven probes per stand the probes were positioned on the stands to permit them to measure velocities across the 16 m deep section of aquifer spanning the 6 hydrostratigraphic units described by critchley et al 2014 with particular focus on layer 4 which had previously been identified as a stratum characterized by high flow rates fig 2 the pvps were fabricated from 3d printed plastic bodies and stainless steel detector wires connected to the surface via cat5 cable devlin et al 2009 walter and devlin 2017 the tracer solution used in the pvp tests consisted of solutions ranging from deionized water to a 0 07 g l nacl solution in site groundwater establishing a tracer specific conductance measurably different from the ambient groundwater and a similar solution density injected tracer volumes ranged from 1 ml to 10 mls depending on the observed responses the great majority of tests were conducted at the lower end of this range the probes were designed to sense both horizontal and vertical flow gibson and devlin 2018 data were collected from all pvps daily for one month prior to the acetate injection phase to document the background flow conditions after acetate additions were underway velocity data were gathered from about half the pvps and limited to times between acetate injections to prevent biases introduced by pumping the data were analyzed with the open source software velprobepe schillig 2012 https www people ku edu jfdevlin software html velprobepe 5 results and discussion 5 1 hydrogeology the most comprehensive water level dataset from the woodstock site was presented by critchley 2010 appendix d for the year 2008 water levels were gathered every month over a period of a year from which it was possible to determine that the hydraulic gradient ranged between 2 07 10 3 and 8 62 10 3 and flow directions varied between southward and northeastward see fig 3b with the predominant flow direction to the east southeast devlin and schillig 2017 found that the water level data from the w075s well may have been influenced by a slow response time or a poor hydraulic connection and that without these data the water flow direction was more uniformly to the southeast schillig et al 2016 reported a representative k for the site of 1 54 10 3 m s based on slug testing in wells wo75s wo74s and wo74d using this value and an average gradient of 0 0045 assuming n 0 3 the overall seepage velocity across the site is estimated to be 2 m d using an average k of 7 5 10 3 m s estimated using the depth discrete 6 layer model of critchley 2010 note all k values in that model were back calculated from velocities estimated from bromide tracer test results the seepage velocity across the site is calculated to be 9 7 m d this higher estimate of velocity is representative of the local area where treatment was occurring where the bromide tracer test was conducted ambient groundwater seepage velocities were also determined with pvps in june and july 2011 schillig 2012 and in november 2011 fig 4a b the summer 2011 survey revealed flow predominantly to the southeast with an average flow that was essentially horizontal mean and median angles were 4o downward and 0o respectively though local flows could deviate from this bulk behavior the november 2011 data were collected in late fall and revealed an eastward shift in the ambient flow direction flow was again near horizontal on average mean and median angles were 9o upward and 0o respectively with locally variable vertical components the minor upward shift in mean flow direction was not significant at the 0 05 level p value 0 163 the distributions of velocity magnitudes were similarly skewed in 2010 and 2011 though the range was somewhat larger in the later dataset with medians shifting upward from about 2 7 m d to 4 7 m d the point measurements pvps indicated that in the area of testing flow was predominantly to the southeast and overall occurring at a rate about half the 6 layer darcy estimate fig 4 despite the differences and considering that typical uncertainties in darcy based velocity values may be up to an order of magnitude the estimated velocities determined here are considered to be reasonably consistent between methods especially at elevation 290 masl where a high permeability stratum is consistently present as discussed below the depth specific patterns of local flow in the treatment zone was first elucidated with the pvps and later confirmed with an independent bromide tracer test critchley 2010 critchley et al 2014 schillig et al 2016 fig 5 the aquifer was found to contain a stratum at elevations in the range of 288 to 290 m above sea level masl in which the seepage velocity was anomalously high i e 10 m d the pvp measurements conducted in november 2011 returned very similar spatial trends with depth compared to the summer months 2011 demonstrating reproducibility though the flow at the pvp4 location was higher by a factor of about 2 in the later survey factors including variations in background flow or variations in the rates of pumping at the nearby municipal wells might have contributed to these differences although the bromide tracer test conducted in 2011 independently confirmed the presence of the high flow stratum the horizontal separations of the pvps and multilevel monitoring wells did reveal some minor variations in the depths of the high velocity strata fig 5 the velocity data presented in fig 5 are important for two reasons first they demonstrate reproducibility of point velocity measurement trends over time and independent measurement methods second they establish zones in the aquifer where water flux is higher than expected using more conventional approaches both of these reasons attest to the importance of the heterogeneity and flow variability at the site the significance of this finding for designing and executing an in situ treatment program is discussed in detail in the sections that follow 5 2 geochemistry and effect of acetate injections the groundwater at the study site can be categorized as freshwater with total dissolved solids of about 600 mg l dominated by calcium and bicarbonate ions the average ph of the groundwater was found to be 7 35 prior to the introduction of acetate the aquifer was aerobic throughout its depth dissolved oxygen in the range of 8 to 13 mg l with a nitrate concentration of about 14 mg l n no3 everywhere except the shallowest depths elev 297 masl where the concentrations were about 5 mg l n no3 figs 2 and 6 daily samples were collected for the analysis of do nitrate and nitrate transformations products and acetate prior to turning the system on and after the nitrate treatment was in progress occasional samples were also collected for major ions as well as iron and manganese no notable changes from background were observed in any of these additional ionic parameters so the following analysis focusses on the daily sampled species as discussed in the introduction section denitrification is the process of transforming nitrate to dinitrogen gas and is mediated by ubiquitous microorganisms called denitrifiers prior work at this site critchley et al 2014 and a nearby site devlin et al 2000 found strong evidence that the dominant mechanism for nitrate reduction was denitrification therefore the geochemical characterization performed here was aimed at tracking denitrification through the primary active species nitrate nitrite for risk evaluation purposes and the electron donor supplied to the aquifer acetate within natural groundwater systems other nitrate transformation processes can influence the fate of nitrate including but not limited to autotrophic denitrification dnra or anammox due to the considerable previous laboratory and field evidence that denitrification was the dominant transformation process in the current study environment the other processes were not considered or tracked throughout the field experiments reported here denitrifiers are facultative anaerobes i e they can thrive in either aerobic or anaerobic environments in anaerobic environments they switch their preferred electron acceptor from do to nitrate thereby initiating denitrification it is commonly held that do concentrations should be less than 0 5 mg l for denitrification to proceed e g tesoriero and puckett 2011 trudell et al 1986 bradley et al 1992 however wolters et al 2022 cited several studies showing denitrification in sediments where the do concentrations were in the range of 1 to 2 mg l or greater therefore in addition to the primary species listed above do was monitored regularly to verify the expected association between oxygen and nitrate disappearances to establish the redox conditions for denitrification acetate was repeatedly introduced to the aquifer over 6 h injection periods at 0 2 l min in accordance with the pulsed nature of a cis the spiked groundwater was introduced into well wo79 while water was being extracted from w078 at the same rate critchley et al 2014 performed similar injections with 135 mg l acetate establishing a cac n ratio in the treatment zone of 2 8 1 they found that in all but three monitored elevations nitrate could be removed to levels below the regulatory limit of 10 mg l n no3 if the injections were repeated on a daily basis the depths where nitrate remained above the regulatory limits elev 290 to 202 masl at ml5 all corresponded to depths where the seepage velocities exceeded 10 m d based on the bromide tracer test and point velocity measured values exceeded about 7 m d schillig et al 2016 this established the importance of hydrogeology as a third factor after acetate presence and nitrate disappearance for the success of the cis to address the problem of uneven flow the acetate source concentration in the current work was increased to 260 mg l cac n 4 5 1 to more aggressively promote nitrate reduction in the strata with the highest seepage velocities an examination of the profiles of nitrate and do after the onset of the acetate injections reveals noteworthy declines in both substances throughout the aquifer at ml5 and ml7 notably the nitrate concentrations fell consistently below the regulatory limit at ml7 with minimal appearance of nitrite fig 6 the concentration profiles show a good positive correlation between do and nitrate both are depleted but display relative maxima at similar depths consistent with expectations for a denitrifying system moreover the highest concentrations of do and nitrate correspond to either depths were seepage velocities were relatively high see bromide tracer test velocities fig 5 elev 290 to 292 masl at ml5 and elev 284 292 to 294 at ml7 or depths not reached by the acetate injections due in part to the injection and extraction well screen depth ranges e g elev 298 masl at ml5 and 284 masl at ml7 see also fig 2b these results further support the conclusions that declines in nitrate concentration were due to nitrate reduction likely denitrification and that groundwater velocity was a primary factor controlling nitrate treatment within the treatment zone i e from the cis well pair to ml7 the prior work reported by critchley et al 2014 demonstrated the effectiveness of the cis at removing nitrate from groundwater with acetate injections over a 26 day period first 11 days on a 24 h cycle of injections and the following 15 days on a 48 h cycle in addition critchley et al 2014 showed that at the woodstock site bi daily injections of acetate were insufficient to drive nitrate below regulatory limits over the full vertical extent of the treatment zone in the current study daily injections were maintained for 55 days to demonstrate a longer term of treatment that would sustain the desired amounts of nitrate removal from the groundwater the success of this endeavor is demonstrated in the time series of acetate do and nitrate at ml5 and ml7 figs 7 8 9 nitrate was reduced to levels below the target of 10 mg l n no3 at all monitored depths where acetate was delivered above 50 mg l in a sustained way the delivery of acetate to the aquifer is the first step in creating the do depletion necessary for denitrification the cis sustained concentrations between 20 mg l and 200 mg l everywhere in the treatment zone except the shallowest and deepest monitored locations ml5 1 and ml7 7 respectively fig 7 the highest concentrations of acetate were observed at ml5 3 ml5 4 and ml5 5 150 to 200 mg l corresponding to elevations near the middle of the injection screen and zones of relatively high seepage velocities the contrast in acetate concentrations with depth was more muted at ml7 but the highest concentrations occurred at about the same elevations at ml7 1 ml7 2 ml7 3 and ml7 4 the lowest acetate concentrations occurred at ml5 1 because this location was above the elevation of the top of the injection and extraction well screens fig 2b in response to the above perturbations do concentrations declined from background levels 8 to 13 mg l to 5 mg l as acetate was aerobically consumed everywhere except ml5 1 and ml7 7 with the majority of samples exhibiting do concentrations 2 mg l by day 55 day zero being the onset of acetate injections fig 8 this evidence strongly supports the association of acetate delivery and stimulated microbial activity in the aquifer although the aquifer was not taken to a complete and uniform anaerobic condition it was likely rendered locally anoxic since notable declines in nitrate occurred contemporaneously with the acetate and do concentration changes discussed in detail below fig 9 this redox environment is beneficial for two reasons first it is evidently sufficient to promote and sustain denitrification second it is not so anaerobic that iron and manganese in the aquifer sediments will be reduced and dissolved in the groundwater this helps avoid the possibility of iron and manganese oxide precipitation on well screens in the treatment zone or in the municipal wells it is noted that the increased supply of acetate in this work compared to the work of critchley et al 2014 to address the high nitrate fluxes in the strata between 288 and 292 masl resulted in acetate persisting through the treatment zone at concentrations nominally between 50 mg l and 100 mg l this carbon flux is in excess of the do and nitrate fluxes and raises the possibility that a more reducing environment could develop further down gradient from the treatment zone however in this system much of the excess acetate is expected to be consumed as treated groundwater mixes with ambient groundwater before reaching the municipal wells several hundred meters down gradient in a full scale system the delivery of acetate would not have to be as uniformly delivered through the section as was done in this study higher acetate fluxes would be established in the higher permeability strata and lower acetate fluxes established in the less permeable strata thus in a full scale system the excess acetate could be minimized monitoring of nitrate in the treatment zone groundwater revealed a decline to levels below the regulatory limit of 10 mg l n no3 by day 20 at most monitored locations as previously mentioned the locations where nitrate persisted were ml5 1 ml5 4 ml5 5 and ml7 7 in the cases of ml5 4 and ml5 5 both acetate delivery and do depletion were observed therefore it is concluded that at those locations the controlling factor for denitrification was hydrogeological this conclusion is strengthened since these depths corresponded to seepage velocities in excess of 10 m d at ml7 7 groundwater velocities approached 20 m d fig 5 and acetate delivery was variable fig 7 both of these factors likely contributed to the sustained n no3 concentrations 10 mg l the occurrence of n no3 at high concentrations at ml5 1 was remarkable because the background levels of nitrate at that location were undetectable prior to the acetate injections nitrate concentrations rose steadily over the test period until by day 36 the concentrations exceeded 10 mg l the possibility of chemical or microbial sources of the observed nitrate at ml5 1 can be ruled out since there was no source of reduced nitrogen that could have been oxidized to nitrate at that depth upgradient of the sampling point therefore once again the change in nitrate concentration is likely attributable to hydrogeological causes in this case it is hypothesized that the nitrate was transported untransformed from deeper locations due to an altered hydraulic conductivity distribution following biostimulation and subsequent vertical flow redirection pvp3 was located proximal to ml5 an examination of the vertical flow direction at pvp3 reveals an overall shift upward following the acetate injections prior to biostimulation the average aggregate vertical flow angle at pvp3 was 9o upward and afterwards it changed to 45o upward fig 10 this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that nitrate at ml5 1 was driven by flow redirection however the changes in flow are more complex at the scale of the individual probes the depths associated with upward flow redirection corresponded to probes pvp3 3 pvp3 5 and pvp3 7 pvp3 1 exhibited upward flow both before and after biostimulation these probes were located at depths considerably below ml5 1 the heterogeneity of the aquifer the offset in locations between pvp3 and ml5 and the possibility of local horizontal flow redirection between pvp3 and ml5 all confound the interpretation of flow sensed by the individual probes the aggregate behavior may therefore be the best indicator of the flow changes responsible for the nitrate transport to ml5 1 albeit indirect 5 3 assessment of treatment performance critchley et al 2014 and critchley 2010 recommended that a longer term test be conducted with daily injections to replicate their findings and demonstrate the viability of longer term treatment they reported a 21 mass removal of nitrate from the groundwater flowing through the treatment zone which they considered unexpectedly high considering the high groundwater velocities encountered in the current work daily injections were performed continuously for 55 days nitrate fluxes were estimated at ml7 which is the furthest monitor downgradient of the injection extraction well pair of the cis table 1 for the purposes of these calculations direct velocity measurements made with pvps and darcy estimates of seepage velocity based on the critchley et al 6 layer model were used to estimate nitrate removal rates the pvp velocities were collected from selected depths and did not extend vertically over the entire treated portion of aquifer so the darcy calculations were performed to provide a complete vertical representation of the aquifer the darcy derived seepage velocities were calculated using the k values reported by critchley et al 2014 eq 7 an average site hydraulic gradient of 3 33 10 3 i and an estimated porosity of θ 0 33 based on the dominantly sandy and gravelly components of the sediments were used in the calculations the darcy derived velocities were calculated through 7 v ki θ where k is hydraulic conductivity ml 1 θ is porosity the velocity values determined this way were compared with the direct velocity measurements at nearby pvp4 and also with the nitrate concentrations measured at ml7 tables 1 and 2 nitrate flux was calculated according to eq 8 8 j q c aq where j is the mass flux of nitrate and c aq is the aqueous concentration of nitrate ml3 q is the water flux q ki for the darcy estimates and q vθ for the pvp based estimates the flux values for each layer can be combined to determine the mass discharge of nitrate through an area a l2 corresponding to the 6 layers 14 6 m vertically and the 5 m separation distance δy between the cis wells w078 and w079 eq 9 9 md i 1 n q i a i c aq i using previously unpublished data from critchley 2010 it was estimated that the mass discharge of nitrate through the treatment zone was 1145 g n d prior to the 11 day acetate injection period after the injection period the mass discharge rate declined to 902 g n d a 21 decline table 2 the calculations were repeated using data collected in the current work before and after the 55 day period of daily acetate injections the mass discharge before treatment began was calculated to be 1063 g n d the post treatment mass discharge was found to be 392 g n d a 63 decline table 2 the decline was similarly estimated to be 43 using the pvp derived velocities the lack of complete vertical coverage by the pvps no doubt contributed to the lower nitrate reduction estimate but given the low nitrate attenuation at the shallowest depths as indicated by the darcy calculations in table 2 the difference may indicate that the darcy calculations somewhat overestimated the treatment rate paradoxically the pvp calculations indicate greater absolute nitrate mass discharges and nitrate mass treated despite the lower removal percentages this unintuitive outcome is a direct result of the flow rates used in the calculations and emphasizes the importance of making velocity determinations as accurately as possible also in both cases the nitrate removal rate was notably improved in this work compared to the earlier trials by critchley et al 2014 critchley 2010 considered the 21 nitrate removal that was observed in the 11 day test was a near best case result for practical purposes the range of depths exhibiting high groundwater flow in the treatment zone was a major limiting factor on performance in the current work the duration of the acetate injections was extended from 11 to 55 days affording the microbial populations additional time to stabilize also the c ac n ratio targeted for the treatment zone was increased from 2 8 to 4 5 to ensure adequate delivery of the acetate to the high velocity strata these measures led to the 43 to 63 level of nitrate removal from the groundwater adding support to the findings of critchley 2010 and demonstrating the viability of the in situ method of nitrate reduction in aquifers a final concern raised in critchley et al 2014 was that nitrite or iron production could accompany the reduction of nitrate the occurrence of nitrite was found to be potentially problematic in locations where groundwater velocities were fastest in the current work nitrite production was only observed above the regulatory limit of 1 mg l n no2 prior to day 10 of the treatment after that time nitrite remained below the maximum allowable concentrations in all monitored locations including those where groundwater velocities were in excess of 10 m d fig 11 neither iron nor manganese concentrations were found to increase notably above background levels probably because do levels remained above 0 5 mg l see chapelle et al 1995 at all monitored multilevel locations throughout most of the experiment with the exceptions of four isolated samples between days 26 and 42 at ml5 6 7 and ml7 1 7 6 implications critchley et al 2014 demonstrated the viability of the cis for in situ treatment of nitrate near a municipal water supply however they noted that the treatment was not complete in zones where the groundwater exhibited seepage velocities of several meters per day the current work demonstrates that nitrate can be treated in these problematic zones by increasing the supply of electron donor in the form of acetate this was achieved without driving the aquifer to a completely anaerobic condition and chemically reducing secondary species such as iron manganese or sulfate within the treatment zone it is noted that acetate was delivered in excess throughout the aquifer section and migrated out of the treatment zone at concentrations that could cause secondary water quality problems down gradient therefore in full scale systems a more targeted acetate delivery system is recommended in such a scheme higher acetate concentrations could be delivered to the strata experiencing the highest nitrate fluxes and lower acetate concentrations delivered to other portions of the aquifer these findings justify a scaled up test with the capability of meaningfully altering the nitrate flux to a municipal well the challenges of such a scale up will be to design the cis to treat enough of the municipal well capture zone to affect a decline in nitrate concentrations in the well as demonstrated in this work a major concern in that scaled up design will be to characterize the flow system adequately so that all major pathways for nitrate mass in the capture zone are taken into account when the cis design is prepared 7 conclusions an important conclusion of this work is that the hydrogeology of the site is a primary factor in determining the success or failure of in situ denitrification in aquifers where denitrifying bacteria are naturally present the importance of high definition aquifer characterization cannot be understated as exemplified at this site this insight was strongly suggested in prior work but the extended treatment time in the current work showed with no ambiguity that the high velocity zones of the aquifer were the ones that posed the greatest challenges for nitrate removal and nitrite accumulation direct velocity measurements using the pvps were applied in a complimentary fashion with a bromide tracer test and later darcy calculations were necessary to provide independent and conclusive evidence for the magnitudes and depths of strata exhibiting problematic flow rates as was noted by schillig 2012 a combination of characterization methods was essential for the successful design of the in situ treatment system it is further noted that the nitrate removal rates indicated by the direct velocity measurements was lower than those calculated from the darcy estimates of velocity but paradoxically the total masses of nitrate removed were higher this finding highlights the potential importance of obtaining the most reliable seepage velocity measurements possible when assessing treatment performance it is further concluded from this work that with proper characterization of the aquifer the cis is a viable in situ treatment method for groundwater contaminated with nitrate it was shown here that even in highly heterogeneous sediments with groundwater velocities varying over an order of magnitude sustained nitrate removal rates near 50 are possible to achieve higher levels of treatment might reasonably be expected in less heterogeneous aquifers moreover with lateral expansion of the well pair system it may be possible to remove a greater mass of nitrate from the groundwater supplying the municipal wells related to the heterogeneity is the wide range of oxygen flux throughout the treatment zone profile oxygen can interfere with denitrification so high oxygen fluxes can limit an in situ denitrification system s performance this was shown to be the case in the work of critchley et al 2014 at the woodstock site the sustained daily injections of acetate 55 days at an enhanced concentration 260 mg l up from 135 mg l were shown to be sufficient to treat nitrate to below regulatory limits with no adverse effects of nitrite production within the treatment zone this extends the work of critchley et al 2014 and demonstrates the robustness and flexibility of the cis method it is also concluded that a cis program can be designed for high rates of nitrate removal without nitrite accumulation with carbon to nitrogen ratios c ac n up to 4 5 which is about seven times the stoichiometric requirement assuming all carbon is used for nitrogen reduction lower ratios might be possible to use in less heterogeneous aquifers the excess carbon supplied in this project did not take the aquifer to fully anoxic conditions nevertheless denitrification was apparently stimulated with minimal nitrite accumulation a side benefit of the redox conditions achieved was that excess reduced manganese and iron were not produced this should minimize well maintenance within the cis wells due to metal oxide precipitation on screens based on prior work at this site and nearby this study was undertaken on the premise that nitrate reduction in response to acetate injections to the aquifer occurred primarily by denitrification although this premise is well supported by earlier research additional work to test the premise at this site is recommended credit authorship contribution statement j shaw formal

1203,over application of manure to agricultural fields can leach nitrogen below the root zone and contaminate groundwater the goal of this study was to evaluate the factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrate in shallow groundwater following 44 years of manure application to irrigated and non irrigated long term test plots sampling of 26 wells over an 18 month period revealed high spatial variability of groundwater nitrate concentrations ranging from 0 1 mg n l to 1350 mg n l mean 118 mg n l the highest concentrations were associated with the highest manure nitrogen loads longer durations of manure application and were generally located beneath irrigated land use regression modeling confirmed that cumulative manure loading had the greatest control on the spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate a significant decreasing temporal trend was observed in selected wells downgradient of plots where manure application ceased more than a decade earlier isotopic analysis of 15n no3 and 18o no3 showed that denitrification occurred at 16 well locations with evidence for dissolved organic carbon as the electron donor the groundwater nitrate trends observed in this long term study demonstrate that historical nutrient and water management practices will affect groundwater quality for many decades to come keywords nitrate leaching groundwater

areas worldwide and has led to drinking water contamination eutrophication hypoxia aquatic toxicity and other water quality concerns holden et al 1992 spalding and exner 1993 fitzgerald et al 1997 goss et al 1998 böhlke 2002 benson et al 2006 puckett et al 2011 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 studies have shown that the majority of groundwater nitrate contamination can be linked to intensive agriculture böhlke 2002 zebarth et al 2015 with the application of synthetic fertilizers and manure considered the primary sources of nitrogen to ensure future water and food security it is important to properly manage the risks of contamination by agricultural nitrogen as well as the major costs required to address these issues zebarth et al 2015 basu et al 2022 many factors affect the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrate in groundwater in agricultural areas burow et al 2010 liao et al 2012 baily et al 2011 for nitrate to leach below the root zone elevated soil nitrate concentrations are needed along with groundwater recharge meisinger and delgado 2002 for this reason studies have found correlations between the degree of groundwater contamination and both the extent of agricultural nitrogen loading nolan 2001 rupert 2008 liao et al 2012 hallberg and keeney 1993 and high groundwater recharge rates nolan and hitt 2006 debernardi et al 2008 böhlke 2002 in contrast some studies have found that lower recharge rates were associated with higher nitrate concentrations green et al 2008 rupert 2008 other factors controlling the distribution of nitrate in groundwater include dissolved oxygen

these relations arise largely because the above mentioned factors are important controls on groundwater recharge and denitrification potential böhlke 2002 contamination of groundwater by anthropogenic nitrogen is a widespread and potentially long lasting issue burow et al 2010 wassenaar et al 2006 tomer and burkart 2003 to prevent or reduce long term contamination beneficial management practices bmps which have the goal of balancing nutrient inputs with crop requirements to reduce leaching potential have been implemented over the past few decades in many agricultural regions wassenaar et al 2006 the few studies examining the effectiveness of bmps have reported inconsistent results stites and kraft 2001 boyer 2007 tomer and burkart 2003 exner et al 2010 wassenaar et al 2006 zebarth et al 2015 for example the abbotsford sumas aquifer saw no improvement in groundwater nitrate concentrations for decades following the implementation of bmps wassenaar et al 2006 zebarth et al 2015 while exner et al 2010 found that groundwater quality improved following 16 years of improved management practices in nebraska s platte river valley recent research suggests the long residence times for solutes in the vadose zone can result in the storage of nitrogen for many decades sebilo et al 2013 worrall et al 2015 meter et al 2016 ascott et al 2017 for example sebilo et al 2013 showed that it will take around 100 years for applied 15n labeled fertilizer to completely leave the 2 m deep soil zone and that only 12 to 17 of that mass will slowly leach toward the saturated zone over eight decades the long legacy of anthropogenic nitrogen in the vadose zone and groundwater demonstrates the failure of current bmps at improving water quality wassenaar et al 2006 basu et al 2022 for this reason more long term studies of the fate and lag time of nitrate under long term nutrient application are imperative for effective watershed management the main goal of this study was to examine the impacts of ongoing long term manure application on the distribution and fate of nitrate in shallow groundwater at an experimental field site in lethbridge alberta canada this was achieved through regular sampling of 26 monitoring wells over an 18 month period followed by detailed analysis of the hydraulic and geochemical data specific objectives included investigation of i key factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrate in groundwater ii the combined influence of precipitation p and irrigation i regime on vadose zone leaching and groundwater flow and transport and iii the role of denitrification in groundwater nitrate attenuation 2 study site this study was conducted between may 2016 and december 2017 at the site of long term manure ltm plots at lethbridge research center in lethbridge alberta fig 1 the study was initiated by agriculture and agri food canada aafc in 1973 to examine the effects of long term manure application on soil quality focusing on soil nitrogen and phosphorus balance and salinity increases hao and benke 2012 the initial setup involved a random block split plot field experiment on a 150 m by 60 m region divided into irrigated and non irrigated halves fig 1 beef cattle manure from a commercial feedlot about 13 km from the site was applied to a series of 7 6 15 2 m plots at rates of 0 30 60 and 90 t ha wet weight on the non irrigated field and 0 60 120 and 180 t ha on the irrigated field chang and entz 1996 these application rates correspond to 0 1 2 and 3 times the recommended rates by alberta agriculture in 1973 which were based largely on manure land disposal needs at the time according to modern standards based on crop nutrient requirements these applications rates are considered relatively high but were maintained over the years for continuity manure was consistently applied after crop harvest in the fall and long term average manure characteristics are compiled in table s1 the cumulative nitrogen loading since 1973 on each plot is shown in fig 2 to investigate soil nutrient persistence over time manure application on specific plots was gradually discontinued prior to the 1987 1990 and 2003 growing seasons while some plots are continuing to receive manure applications fig 2 furthermore as part of a separate study the top 15 cm of the soil profile was removed from seven of the eight

year via a semi stationary sprinkler pipe system in 2016 a total of 222 mm of irrigation water was applied on three separate dates between june 20 and july 6 while 127 mm total irrigation was applied

monitoring was conducted using the existing aafc network of 32 monitoring wells designated mw 1 to mw 32 and 10 piezometers designated p22 1 to p22 8 the wells were installed between 1973 and 1990 and are fully screened across the water table to the base of each well well depths ranged from 3 0 to 6 0 m below ground surface mbgs with the majority ranging between 5 and 6 mbgs the 10 piezometers were installed on the irrigated field in 2002 fig 1 as a vertical nest with 0 4 m screened intervals bottoming out at depths ranging from 0 9 to 4 8 mbgs i e spaced every 0 5 m vertically six of the original 32 wells and one piezometer p22 8 were either missing or too damaged to be used and were therefore omitted from this study groundwater elevations were monitored at 2 h intervals using pressure transducers 13 onset hobo 4 solinst levelogger installed in select monitoring wells fig 1 and later corrected for barometric pressure effects using barometric and earth tide correction betco software toll and rasmussen 2007 horizontal groundwater flow directions were estimated by kriging measured groundwater elevation data using surfer 8 golden software to assist with subsequent nitrogen loading estimates see section 3 4 horizontal groundwater flow vectors were calculated monthly june 2016 to june 2017 on the day prior to groundwater sampling field saturated hydraulic conductivity k estimates were obtained from single well response slug bail tests on all suitable monitoring wells i e 20 of 26 wells where slug insertion was feasible water levels during the slug bail tests were recorded at one minute intervals using pressure transducers and data were analyzed using aqtesolv software following the method of hvorslev 1951 and butler 1998 groundwater samples were regularly collected in 13 sampling events from june 2016 to december 2017 prior to sampling all wells and piezometers were either purged of approximately three well volumes or were purged dry for slowly recovering wells sampled the following day groundwater samples were collected with a peristaltic pump placed in clean 500 ml polyethylene bottles and stored in a cooler on ice for transport samples

technique isotope ratios expressed in delta notation δ were calculated relative to the international n2 and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standards for 15n and 18o respectively the expected analytical accuracies were 0 5 for δ15n no3 and 1 0 for δ18o no3 additional details regarding the groundwater monitoring including well construction water levels hydraulic conductivity estimates and analysis procedures are available in kyte 2018 3 2 soil sampling and testing on august 29 2016 six vertical soil cores were collected to 1 5 m depth at borehole locations denoted bh 01 to bh 06 adjacent to wells mw 18 22 16 08 02 and 05 using a truck mounted direct push rig fig 1 soil samples were collected at depth intervals of 0 15 15 30 30 45 45 60 60 90 90 120 and 120 150 cm bgs for each location selected samples were analyzed for particle size malvern mastersizer2000 soil bulk density hao et al 2008 and soil water retention characteristics reynolds and topp 2008 soil properties are listed in table 1 with the soil water retention data fitted to the model of van genuchten 1980 3 3 groundwater recharge estimation the water table fluctuation wtf method which links changes in groundwater storage to water table fluctuations healy and cook 2002 was used to estimate recharge on the study site the wtf method is suitable for unconfined aquifers that show sharp water table rises following precipitation and irrigation events healy and cook 2002 such as the current study site more importantly consideration of vadose zone flow mechanisms is not required for applying the method recharge r m for each water table rise event was calculated at all 17 well locations where pressure transducers were installed fig 1 using 1 r s y h where sy is the specific yield unitless and δh is the change in water table elevation m over the event period corrected for any observed long term water table recession due to the dependence of specific yield on water table depth which is particularly relevant for the fine grained sediments at this study site specific yield was calculated from the cheng et al 2015 method as 2 s y θ s h 1 h 2 θdh h 2 h 1 where θs m3 m3 is the saturated soil water content θ m3 m3 is soil water content under steady state conditions h1 m is the initial ground height above the water table i e initial water table depth and h2 m is the new equilibrium ground height above the water table i e final water table depth specific yield was estimated based on site water table conditions and measured soil water retention data fitted to the van genuchten 1980 model table 1 yielding values ranging from 0 050 to 0 083 3 4 cumulative nitrogen loading cumulative mass of nitrogen applied mt kg n to each field plot from 1973 to 2017 was calculated using the following equation 3 m t j m a p t where jm kg n m2 yr is the annual nitrogen loading rate to the plot ap m2 is the plot area and t is the length of time yr manure has been applied to each plot jm was calculated as the product of the reported total nitrogen composition of manure table s1 and the annual manure loading rate kg m2 yr of each respective plot in these calculations the nitrogen composition of manure was converted from dry weight basis to wet weight basis using the reported average water content of manure the original ltm experiment included termination of manure loading on selected plots at years 1987 1990 and 2003 fig 2 thus reducing the total n load on certain plots with time when some fraction of the nitrogen applied to or present in the soil zone is leached down to the water table it is often transported laterally in groundwater to downgradient monitoring wells which can be used under the right conditions to quantify nitrate loading to groundwater malekani et al 2018 as such soil manure loading can influence nitrate levels in downgradient monitoring wells and we attempted to use groundwater flow information to evaluate the impact of historical manure loading on groundwater nitrate levels to link manure loading to specific wells horizontal groundwater flow vectors were calculated monthly throughout the study period to determine which upgradient manure loading plot most directly contributed to each groundwater monitoring well fig 2 the manure loading from the nearest plot hydraulically upgradient of the well was assigned to each well in cases where the groundwater flow direction varied throughout the study period a weighted average of the manure application rate on the different upgradient plots was used for the cumulative nitrogen loading calculations 3 5 nitrogen leaching the mass of nitrogen leaching at each monitoring well location beneath the ltm plots was determined between june 9 2016 and december 14 2017 from the time varying groundwater recharge estimates and the corresponding measured nitrate concentrations for each discrete groundwater recharge event mass of nitrogen leached expressed as g n m2 was calculated by multiplying the groundwater recharge estimated from the wtf method by the measured groundwater nitrate concentration from the nearest sampling date cumulative n leaching was obtained by summing the discrete event values over specific seasons or the full study period monitoring wells mw 06 09 and 14 went dry on occasion and were excluded from the calculations due to missing sampling events 3 6 generalized additive mixed model analysis generalized additive mixed models gamms are regression models that use non linear smooth functions of select predictor variables or covariates to assess relationships with a chosen response variable woods 2006 mellor and cey 2015 in the gamm analysis for this study groundwater nitrate concentration was the response variable while chosen covariates included water table depth groundwater temperature recharge amount spatial location elapsed time since the beginning of study doc c n ratio doc no3 n average 15n at each well location and cumulative nitrogen loading since 1973 the gamm analysis was also repeated with chloride concentrations as the response variable gamms were chosen for this study because they allow for random effects that can help correct for the lack of independence between covariates first order autoregressive correlation structure ar1 was used to model the spatial and temporal autocorrelations and individual well locations were used as random effects to remove any influence that spatial effects between wells or the repeated sampling of a specific well had on the data 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater levels and flow over the two growing seasons groundwater elevations were generally highest in the northern portion of the site and lowest in the south yielding a general groundwater flow direction from north to south fig 3 seasonal and annual changes in water table elevations resulted in changes in horizontal groundwater flow directions across the field site specific to the ltm site and study duration were high groundwater elevations in mw1 influenced and maintained by the close proximity of a water filled dugout which unintendedly affected local groundwater flow as a result on the western non irrigated field the average groundwater flow direction remained steady toward the southeast fig 3 on the eastern irrigated field however groundwater mounding due to irrigation considerably affected the flow direction most notably during the 2016 growing season following the onset of monitoring early june 2016 not shown groundwater elevations rose significantly underneath the irrigated side within a month fig s1c and d in response to a total of 222 mm of irrigation jun 20 jul 6 and additional 63 mm jul 13 28 of precipitation that followed out of 120 mm from jun aug for the same period groundwater levels increased under the non irrigated side in response to precipitation although to lesser heights than observed under irrigation fig s1b the localized mounding resulted in a flow divide beneath the irrigated field such that part of the flow was directed west toward the non irrigated field while the remaining flow was directed westbound outside the treatment zone boundary fig 3a mounding was sufficient to induce a horizontal hydraulic gradient reversal on the northwestern portion of the irrigated area groundwater levels declined during the 2016 2017 winter period and mounding slowly subsided fig 3b similar groundwater flow patterns and mounding under the irrigated side were observed in the 2017 growing season fig 3c however mound heights and extent were lessened because both growing season precipitation 79 mm jun aug and irrigation 127 mm jun 20 jul 19 were lower in 2017 hydraulic conductivity values estimated from single well tests ranged from 8 10 8 to 1 10 10 m s fig s2 the smallest k values were measured near wells mw 03 04 and 19 beneath the non irrigated field while the largest k values wells mw 29 27 22 23 and 14 were generally located beneath irrigated plots and the buffer area south of the ltm plots fig s2 horizontal hydraulic gradients were consistently largest near the northwestern boundary of the study area 0 030 while gradients were lowest near mw 19 0 002 the area with the lowest hydraulic conductivity fig s2 similarly specific discharge darcy flux ranged from 1 10 9 m s near mw 01 to 2 10 12 m s near mw 19 across the site the maximum and minimum horizontal groundwater flow velocities for the site calculated using the site average porosity of 0 50 table 1 were 2 10 9 m s 0 06 m year and 4 10 12 m s 0 0001 m year the average vertical gradient of 0 26 was measured in the piezometer nest on the irrigated field vertical k was not calculated in this study so the horizontal k estimated from slug tests was used to calculate specific discharge vertical specific discharge was estimated to be 8 10 9 m s resulting in a vertical average groundwater flow velocity of 2 10 8 m s 0 5 m year the total magnitude of groundwater recharge calculated using the wtf method from june 2016 to october 2017 averaged 288 mm for the irrigated wells n 6 and 125 mm for the non irrigated wells n 8 table 2 for comparison a simple water balance p et0 technique yielded similar results with recharge values of 225 mm beneath the irrigated plots and 96 mm beneath the non irrigated plots over the same period data not shown see kyte 2018 seasonal groundwater recharge was greatest during the summer months jun aug in both irrigation and non irrigated locations for the entire 2016 2017 study period 97 of irrigated area recharge and 75 of the non irrigated area recharge collectively occurred during the growing season periods table 2 olson et al 2009 found a similar result studying nitrate leaching in two irrigated field sites about 30 km northeast of the current study site with annual peak water table levels occurring from late june to august for the small fraction of remaining recharge the majority was associated with spring snowmelt events late mar early apr 2017 for both the irrigated and non irrigated wells growing season jun aug recharge was driven by precipitation and irrigation conditions particularly their temporal rate and distribution table 2 for the two growing seasons estimated recharge on the non irrigated field was 60 7 mm in 2016 and 33 6 mm in 2017 table 2 representing 51 and 43 of each seasons precipitation recharge was much greater for the irrigated field with 227 5 mm in jun aug 2016 67 of p i due to large and closely distributed irrigations applied in early summer precipitation and irrigation were both considerably reduced in the 2017 growing season resulting in recharge of 52 6 mm 26 of p i below the irrigated field multiple year observations would be needed for assessing the effects of annual climate variability on recharge and other processes influencing recharge at this site 4 2 groundwater quality groundwater nitrate and chloride concentrations are presented in fig 4 and mapped in fig 5 across all 26 long screened wells mean nitrate n was 118 mg n l and ranged from below the detection limit 0 1 mg n l to 1350 mg n l while mean chloride was 237 mg l and ranged from 1 7 mg l to 1932 mg l fig 4a from the same 26 wells 18 had nitrate concentrations greater than the drinking water guideline of 10 mg n l health canada 2012 within the nine vertically nested piezometers on the irrigated field concentrations ranged between 236 and 708 mg n l for nitrate and between 289 and 1423 mg l for chloride fig 4a concentrations in the piezometer nest were generally higher than the long screen monitoring wells fig 4a however the piezometer concentrations were consistent with the closest individual monitoring well mw 22 fig 1 the spatial distributions of nitrate n and chloride average over all events concentrations exhibited similar patterns fig 5 with the highest concentrations beneath the irrigated field toward the boundary with the non irrigated field mw12 no3 n 706 mg l cl 1139 mg l and along the southern boundary mw22 no3 n 618 mg l cl 1123 mg l similarly concentrations were higher on average beneath irrigated plots no3 n 240 mg l cl 434 mg l than non irrigated plots no3 n 89 mg l cl 191 mg l figs 4b and 5 concentrations in the sentinel wells defined here as wells located outside the ltm experiment area boundaries were lowest with mean values of 11 mg n l for nitrate and 65 mg l for chloride fig 4b the differences between means for all three data groups irrigated non irrigated and sentinel wells were found to be significantly different based on the kruskal wallis test p 10 16 while groundwater nitrate contamination in agricultural areas around the world is common few studies have reported nitrate concentrations as high as this study site as a comparator 5100 groundwater wells in the united states were tested for nitrate from 1991 to 2003 and those samples collected from shallow groundwater beneath agricultural land had a median groundwater nitrate concentration of 3 1 mg n l burow et al 2010 similarly in prince edward island canada where agricultural activities occur on almost half of the island s land area mean groundwater nitrate concentrations were 3 99 mg n l benson et al 2006 another study in the battersea area of southern alberta which has the highest density of livestock in alberta reported 583 groundwater samples having an overall mean concentration of 18 mg n l kohn et al 2016 the ltm study is unique in that it shows shallow groundwater nitrate concentrations immediately beneath a long term source of nitrate contamination with relatively high rates of manure application which were based largely on historical manure land disposal practices rather than current practices where manure n loading is matched to crop nutrient requirements when combined with irrigation induced leaching and low permeability sediments the result is higher than typical groundwater nitrate concentrations nevertheless the ltm plots are still relevant for assessing factors affecting groundwater contamination notably the long term accumulation of excess soil nitrogen whether from manure or inorganic fertilizers common in many regions and impacts from any reductions in nitrogen loading the distribution of groundwater nitrate contamination corresponded directly with the cumulative nitrogen loading from manure as applied on plots upgradient of each well fig 6 this relationship between manure loading and elevated nitrate in groundwater is supported by several studies in the region riddell and rodvang 1992 rodvang et al 2004 olson et al 2009 riddell and rodvang 1992 reported that manure application rates between 60 and 155 t ha increased the frequency of nitrate in groundwater above the drinking water standard and rodvang et al 2004 showed that agricultural intensity including manure usage affected shallow groundwater nitrate levels in southern alberta examining the groundwater nitrate and chloride plumes fig 5 there has been relatively little lateral migration of the plumes from where the manure loading initially occurred this is expected due to the low hydraulic conductivity sediments at the site fig s2 which allow for a maximum of approximately 2 m of lateral nitrate or chloride transport over the 44 years since the manure loading began when accounting for advection alone while the effects of diffusion were not quantified it is important to note that diffusion can be an important transport mechanism in low permeability sediments like those found at this site sulphate and doc were also analyzed in this study mainly to assess potential electron donors in relevant redox reactions which will be discussed in later sections the average doc mg l in the 278 samples collected throughout the study period was 30 mg l with a range from 6 4 to 94 mg l sulphate concentrations at the site are naturally elevated in the glacial sediments of the region with mean value of 3609 mg l range from 419 to 10 490 mg l over 283 samples 4 3 nitrogen leaching nitrogen no3 n mass leached to groundwater during this study is presented in table 2 and showed considerable seasonal variability driven largely by the observed groundwater recharge variability the vast majority of nitrate leaching occurred during the growing season jun aug with 98 of nitrogen leached during the combined 2016 and 2017 growing seasons non growing season nitrogen leaching was limited due to lower groundwater recharge during winter of 2017 sep 2016 to may 2017 resulting in an estimated 2 of nitrogen leached from the irrigated field during this period 0 below the non irrigated field predictably over the full study period 23 times greater total nitrogen mass was leached beneath the irrigated area 119 9 mg n m2 than the non irrigated areas 5 0 mg n m2 owing to the greater recharge rates table 2 arising from irrigation combined with relatively high nitrate concentrations fig 5a calculations indicated considerable variability in nitrogen mass leached at different well locations which can generally be explained by spatial variability of manure loading rates as well as manure application duration in the ltm experiment see fig 2 in areas where manure was still being applied seasonal leaching was evident in wells notably mw 05 90 mg n m2 mw 11 high nitrate but recharge not available for full period mw 18 36 mg n m2 and mw 22 185 mg n m2 nitrate and chloride concentrations generally increased following recharge events in these areas fig s1b indicating leaching of excess nitrogen stored in the vadose zone and resulting in an inverse relation between water table depths and nitrate concentrations fig 7 for other wells with ongoing manure application nearby leaching was low e g mw 03 or could not be quantified e g mw 06 14 19 wells located in areas downgradient of the manure plots where manure application ceased in 2003 i e mw 04 12 and 20 also showed substantial amounts of nitrogen leaching despite no current manure application mw 12 289 mg n m2 and mw 20 118 mg n m2 had some of the highest leaching while mw 04 7 mg n m2 showed less leaching likely due to being situated near the upgradient boundary in an area of lower hydraulic conductivity fig s2 evidence of nitrate leaching in locations where manure is no longer being applied supports the idea that nitrogen stored in the soil from past manure applications can sustain elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations due to continued n mineralization and leaching these results are similar to sebilo et al 2013 who observed that only 8 12 of 15n labeled tracer applied to agricultural soils leached toward the hydrosphere in their 30 year observation period while 12 15 remained available for future leaching similarly tomer and burkart 2003 concluded that heavy nitrogen loading between 1969 and 1974 affected groundwater nitrate concentrations in the watershed for another three decades inverse relations between water table depth i e measured as depth below ground surface immediately prior to sampling and nitrate concentrations were also observed at well locations mw 04 12 and 20 where manure application ceased in 2003 fig 7 but some temporal variability was noted for example mw 12 showed an increase in groundwater nitrate following a recharge event in july 2016 but concentrations decreased following smaller recharge events in summer of 2017 fig s1c in general water levels at this well location rose rapidly following precipitation and irrigation events indicating that preferential flow along macropores was likely a factor macropore flow can either a increase nitrogen leaching by allowing rapid transport to depth or b decrease nitrogen leaching by protecting nutrients in smaller matrix pores from being mobilized by recharge concentrated along macropores lehmann and schroth 2003 this apparently divergent behavior could explain why some recharge events decreased nitrate concentrations and other events resulted in increased nitrate but the exact cause cannot be determined and other factors such as seasonal groundwater mounding recession near the boundary between irrigated and non irrigated fields may have also played a role the relation between water table depth and nitrate concentration was less prevalent in well locations where manure application stopped prior to 1990 data not shown see kyte 2018 indicating less leaching of nitrate in recharge waters for example in mw 23 where manure application ceased and the top 15 cm soil was removed in 1990 recharge events resulted in a decrease in nitrate concentrations fig s1d due to dilution of the nitrate already present in groundwater this suggests that improvements in groundwater quality can be achieved in agricultural areas following reductions in fertilizer n or manure n inputs mann kendall tests were applied to site averaged nitrate and chloride concentrations to evaluate temporal trends throughout the study period fig 8 a negative mann kendall score p 0 003 indicated that nitrate n concentrations decreased significantly with time from the first sampling event on june 23 2016 136 mg n l to the final sampling event on december 13 2017 67 mg n l fig 8 similarly chloride concentrations decreased significantly throughout the study period p 0 005 these decreases in nitrate and chloride concentrations could be due to either a net decrease in the amount of leaching throughout the study period or a longer term trend associated with the reduction of manure loading across the site over decadal time scales the first explanation is plausible since the largest groundwater recharge and nitrogen leaching events occurred near the beginning of the study period july 2016 and nitrate concentrations may be expected to decline over time due to the relative lack of further large leaching events combined with the presence of natural dilution and attenuation processes a second explanation for the decreasing groundwater nitrate and chloride concentrations is the reduced manure loads due to the cessation of manure application on selected plots over time in 1987 manure application ceased on one third of all plots with further cessations of applied manure on selected plots in 1990 and 2003 fig 2 trend analyses were completed on individual wells and the results showed a significantly p 0 05 or lower decreasing trend for nitrate concentrations in wells mw 04 12 and 20 where manure application ceased in 2003 similarly the decreasing trend was also significant in well locations mw 07 and mw 23 where manure loading ceased prior to 1990 but where loading rates were initially high 180 kg ha and 120 kg ha respectively fig 1 wells under ongoing manure treatment namely mw 02 05 18 19 and 22 did not show a significant decreasing trend through time with the exception of mw 11 these results suggest that the decreasing trend in site averaged groundwater nitrate concentrations is most likely controlled by the cessation of manure application on select ltm plots the evidence shows that reducing manure loading can have a positive effect on groundwater quality but for the site flow conditions and loading history the benefits will be slow to materialize with adverse effects to shallow groundwater quality for many years or decades following application data shows high nitrate concentrations were maintained in locations where manure has not been applied for decades i e 2003 or earlier several locations where the top 15 cm of soil was stripped and annual manure applications stopped as early as 1990 e g mw 7 and mw 23 had relatively modest nitrogen leaching owing to the increased time since the last manure application yet nitrate concentrations remain elevated above the acceptable drinking water guideline since cumulative nitrogen loading has a strong relationship with current groundwater nitrate concentrations fig 6 it will be a critical factor in controlling long term nitrogen leaching continuing observations from long term experiments such as the ltm plot study will be helpful when establishing bmps for similar agricultural areas in the future 4 4 isotopic analysis of nitrate isotopic δ15n composition of groundwater nitrate ranged between 9 1 and 81 9 with an average of 28 5 n 72 the δ18o of nitrate ranged between 5 5 and 30 5 with the average being 5 2 n 61 a dual isotope plot fig 9a confirms the primary source of nitrate in shallow groundwater at the ltm site was manure since most samples either plotted within or to the right of the sewage manure signature region nikolenko et al 2017 apart from the distinct source signature fig 9a also indicates a likely denitrification process for well data where an increase in both δ18o and δ15n are evident marked with an arrow and δ15n no3 enrichment extends beyond the typical 10 25 manure signature fig 9a denitrification is inferred to potentially occur in 16 of 26 well locations where δ15n no3 values were 25 during at least one of the four sampling events from february to october 2017 fig 9b seven wells had δ15n no3 values exceeding 25 during all sampling events mw 02 08 16 19 26 28 29 and were largely situated on the perimeter of the ltm experiment site surrounding regions with the highest nitrate levels when comparing δ15n no3 and the no3 n values for all samples fig 9b elevated δ15n no3 values 25 occur at lower nitrate n concentrations while higher nitrate n concentrations do not display elevated δ15n no3 values suggesting denitrification may be effective at this site for limiting the spatial extent of nitrate contamination controls on groundwater nitrate and the role of denitrification can also be evaluated using the combined nitrate and chloride data sets mariotti et al 1988 bourke et al 2019 given that groundwater chloride and nitrate were derived from manure in this case we would expect to see a consistent no3 n cl ratio both spatially and temporally if no attenuation were occurring alternately denitrification causes a decrease in both nitrate concentrations and no3 n cl ratios together with a corresponding theoretical exponential increase in 15n of residual nitrate mariotti et al 1988 thus the inverse linear relationship between log no3 n cl and δ15n no3 in samples collected from mar oct 2017 fig 10 points to denitrification at certain locations across the site those wells with the highest no3 n cl ratios e g mw 18 22 represent the source of the nitrate plume where n leaching was greatest whereas wells with lower no3 n cl ratios e g mw 29 32 located on the perimeter were the product of nitrate attenuation by denitrification as expected the relationship is not perfectly linear and some wells such as mw 08 and mw 32 diverged slightly from this trend at times likely due to their peripheral location and therefore being affected by mixing with lower nitrate waters from surrounding areas the obvious exceptions to this relationship were wells mw 01 03 09 and 17 located in areas hydraulically upgradient of the ltm plots fig 10 which have therefore not been affected by manure application to the same degree and are considered zones of limited nitrate leaching mw 02 despite being located in the same general area as these upgradient wells fig 2 behaves differently as a result of the manure loading plot immediately to the west which still receives manure applications and the groundwater flow vectors follow a principally eastern flow direction consequently mw 02 has relatively high 15n values indicating some potential for denitrification despite relatively low nitrate concentrations the carbon nitrogen c n ratio in groundwater at this site can explain the controls on denitrification a positive correlation between groundwater c n ratios and 15n enrichment was observed fig 11 indicating that carbon was likely an electron donor for denitrification the four upgradient wells noted earlier mw 01 03 09 and 17 see fig 10 were again the exceptions due to very low nitrate concentrations meaning denitrification was nitrate limited the wells with the highest c n ratios and 15n enrichment namely mw 02 08 16 28 and 29 were predominantly outside the manure application area fig 1 the increased doc relative to nitrate at these locations could be due to the mixing with higher c n waters from outside the ltm plots emphasizing that carbon availability is likely an important control on denitrification potential while the relationship between 15n enrichment and c n supports the importance of organic carbon as an electron donor in this study more comprehensive analysis of carbon and sulphur isotopes vitòria et al 2008 could elucidate if other electron donors were involved in denitrification in the site groundwater including pyrite fes2 which is an effective electron donor in reduced glacial deposits in southern alberta rodvang et al 2014 rodvang and ryan 2011 4 5 generalized additive mixed models not surprisingly results from the gamm analysis showed that cumulative nitrogen loading from manure was the most dominant control on groundwater nitrate concentrations p 10 12 fig 12a table 3 nitrogen loading also showed a significant effect p 10 12 on chloride concentrations table 3 since both nitrate and chloride were sourced from manure application the non linear shape of the smooth function for nitrogen loading fig 12a shows that a threshold nitrogen loading value exists below which there is little influence on groundwater nitrate concentrations above about 20 000 kg n ha the steeper slope of fig 12a indicates that cumulative nitrogen loading beyond this level resulted in increased groundwater nitrate concentrations note that the gamm analysis did not explicitly consider any time varying component to n loading rates such as manure application on selected plots ceasing at different times but longer manure loading durations are nevertheless reflected in increased cumulative n loading rates alberta agriculture and forestry aaf reported the upper limit for the recommended nitrogen application rate to barley crops under irrigated conditions to be 146 kg ha alberta agriculture and forestry 2004 which corresponds to a cumulative total of 6380 kg ha for the entire 44 year study period cumulative manure loading of 20 000 kg ha is over three times the aaf recommended rate and this excessive manure loading clearly leads to increased nitrate leaching and groundwater contamination doc and sulphate were investigated with the goal to better understand the controls on denitrification at the ltm plots in the gamm analysis doc had a significant positive relationship with nitrate concentrations in groundwater p 1 8 10 4 fig 12b table 3 which is consistent with organic carbon as an electron donor during denitrification korom 1992 a positive correlation however was also observed between doc and chloride in groundwater p 1 1 10 3 table 3 although this relationship was weaker than that between nitrate and doc it indicates that the correlations between carbon nitrate and chloride are likely due to all three being sourced from manure reduced sulphur such as pyrite has previously been reported as a common electron donor for denitrification in southern alberta rodvang et al 2014 rodvang and ryan 2011 and results in an increase in sulphate while nitrate is consumed the gamm analysis revealed however there was no significant relationship between nitrate and sulphate concentrations fig 12d but such a relation could be masked by the naturally high sulphate concentrations in glacial till of southern alberta hendry et al 1986 the gamm analysis confirmed the trend of decreasing nitrate and chloride concentrations over the study period time measured in days since the beginning of the study had a significant negative effect on nitrate p 2 10 3 and chloride p 4 10 4 in groundwater even when other key covariates like nitrogen loading and spatial location were considered nitrate concentrations tended to increase slightly with reductions in water table depth data not shown which is consistent with leaching of nitrogen from the root zone above but the gamm analysis indicated that the effect was not significant for nitrate or chloride concentrations in groundwater table 3 5 conclusions the long term 44 yr nature of manure nitrogen loading in this study is unprecedented in the literature yielding crucial insights into groundwater pollution risks and mitigating factors regular groundwater monitoring over an 18 month period revealed nitrate concentrations were much higher beneath irrigated plots 240 mg n l than non irrigated plots 89 mg n l and sentinel well locations 11 mg n l due to the differing manure loading regimes and increased leaching potential under irrigation more than 20 times greater nitrate leaching beneath the irrigated field points to the critical importance of irrigation and crop water management practices cumulative manure loading was the most important control on groundwater nitrate contamination but this study was also unique in demonstrating how ceasing manure application can influence groundwater nitrate potentially lowering concentrations over the longer term a key implication is that soil management practices need to consider long term n mineralization potential along with total nitrogen loading to protect groundwater quality site averaged nitrate concentrations trended significantly downward due in part to reductions in manure loading and similarly nitrate concentrations in individual wells often reflected the cessation or continued application of manure in upgradient plots collectively the data suggest that where a long legacy of n loading is present improvements in water quality from reduced n loading are achievable but the improvements may take decades to materialize due to the long lag times involved while nitrogen loading was the primary control on groundwater nitrate distributions natural attenuation of nitrate was also important at this site denitrification was inferred to occur in 16 of 26 wells based on 15n no3 isotope values as well as no3 n cl ratios with the strongest denitrification signals recorded in sentinel wells near the perimeter of the field site where manure was never applied denitrification in these locations was likely related to the increase in doc from mixing with carbon rich waters coming from outside the ltm plots increasing 15n no3 with increasing c n ratios revealed that organic carbon was likely the dominant electron donor for denitrification therefore management strategies that increase doc in groundwater may help mitigate nitrate contamination in agricultural areas with similar environmental geochemical and hydrogeological conditions

1203,over application of manure to agricultural fields can leach nitrogen below the root zone and contaminate groundwater the goal of this study was to evaluate the factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrate in shallow groundwater following 44 years of manure application to irrigated and non irrigated long term test plots sampling of 26 wells over an 18 month period revealed high spatial variability of groundwater nitrate concentrations ranging from 0 1 mg n l to 1350 mg n l mean 118 mg n l the highest concentrations were associated with the highest manure nitrogen loads longer durations of manure application and were generally located beneath irrigated land use regression modeling confirmed that cumulative manure loading had the greatest control on the spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate a significant decreasing temporal trend was observed in selected wells downgradient of plots where manure application ceased more than a decade earlier isotopic analysis of 15n no3 and 18o no3 showed that denitrification occurred at 16 well locations with evidence for dissolved organic carbon as the electron donor the groundwater nitrate trends observed in this long term study demonstrate that historical nutrient and water management practices will affect groundwater quality for many decades to come keywords nitrate leaching groundwater quality manure application irrigation denitrification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater nitrate contamination is a common problem in many agricultural areas worldwide and has led to drinking water contamination eutrophication hypoxia aquatic toxicity and other water quality concerns holden et al 1992 spalding and exner 1993 fitzgerald et al 1997 goss et al 1998 böhlke 2002 benson et al 2006 puckett et al 2011 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 studies have shown that the majority of groundwater nitrate contamination can be linked to intensive agriculture böhlke 2002 zebarth et al 2015 with the application of synthetic fertilizers and manure considered the primary sources of nitrogen to ensure future water and food security it is important to properly manage the risks of contamination by agricultural nitrogen as well as the major costs required to address these issues zebarth et al 2015 basu et al 2022 many factors affect the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrate in groundwater in agricultural areas burow et al 2010 liao et al 2012 baily et al 2011 for nitrate to leach below the root zone elevated soil nitrate concentrations are needed along with groundwater recharge meisinger and delgado 2002 for this reason studies have found correlations between the degree of groundwater contamination and both the extent of agricultural nitrogen loading nolan 2001 rupert 2008 liao et al 2012 hallberg and keeney 1993 and high groundwater recharge rates nolan and hitt 2006 debernardi et al 2008 böhlke 2002 in contrast some studies have found that lower recharge rates were associated with higher nitrate concentrations green et al 2008 rupert 2008 other factors controlling the distribution of nitrate in groundwater include dissolved oxygen nolan 1999 dissolved organic carbon nolan 1999 irrigation böhlke 2002 hydrogeology mellor and cey 2015 kohn et al 2016 soil drainage nolan 2001 böhlke 2002 and unsaturated zone thickness böhlke 2002 these relations arise largely because the above mentioned factors are important controls on groundwater recharge and denitrification potential böhlke 2002 contamination of groundwater by anthropogenic nitrogen is a widespread and potentially long lasting issue burow et al 2010 wassenaar et al 2006 tomer and burkart 2003 to prevent or reduce long term contamination beneficial management practices bmps which have the goal of balancing nutrient inputs with crop requirements to reduce leaching potential have been implemented over the past few decades in many agricultural regions wassenaar et al 2006 the few studies examining the effectiveness of bmps have reported inconsistent results stites and kraft 2001 boyer 2007 tomer and burkart 2003 exner et al 2010 wassenaar et al 2006 zebarth et al 2015 for example the abbotsford sumas aquifer saw no improvement in groundwater nitrate concentrations for decades following the implementation of bmps wassenaar et al 2006 zebarth et al 2015 while exner et al 2010 found that groundwater quality improved following 16 years of improved management practices in nebraska s platte river valley recent research suggests the long residence times for solutes in the vadose zone can result in the storage of nitrogen for many decades sebilo et al 2013 worrall et al 2015 meter et al 2016 ascott et al 2017 for example sebilo et al 2013 showed that it will take around 100 years for applied 15n labeled fertilizer to completely leave the 2 m deep soil zone and that only 12 to 17 of that mass will slowly leach toward the saturated zone over eight decades the long legacy of anthropogenic nitrogen in the vadose zone and groundwater demonstrates the failure of current bmps at improving water quality wassenaar et al 2006 basu et al 2022 for this reason more long term studies of the fate and lag time of nitrate under long term nutrient application are imperative for effective watershed management the main goal of this study was to examine the impacts of ongoing long term manure application on the distribution and fate of nitrate in shallow groundwater at an experimental field site in lethbridge alberta canada this was achieved through regular sampling of 26 monitoring wells over an 18 month period followed by detailed analysis of the hydraulic and geochemical data specific objectives included investigation of i key factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrate in groundwater ii the combined influence of precipitation p and irrigation i regime on vadose zone leaching and groundwater flow and transport and iii the role of denitrification in groundwater nitrate attenuation 2 study site this study was conducted between may 2016 and december 2017 at the site of long term manure ltm plots at lethbridge research center in lethbridge alberta fig 1 the study was initiated by agriculture and agri food canada aafc in 1973 to examine the effects of long term manure application on soil quality focusing on soil nitrogen and phosphorus balance and salinity increases hao and benke 2012 the initial setup involved a random block split plot field experiment on a 150 m by 60 m region divided into irrigated and non irrigated halves fig 1 beef cattle manure from a commercial feedlot about 13 km from the site was applied to a series of 7 6 15 2 m plots at rates of 0 30 60 and 90 t ha wet weight on the non irrigated field and 0 60 120 and 180 t ha on the irrigated field chang and entz 1996 these application rates correspond to 0 1 2 and 3 times the recommended rates by alberta agriculture in 1973 which were based largely on manure land disposal needs at the time according to modern standards based on crop nutrient requirements these applications rates are considered relatively high but were maintained over the years for continuity manure was consistently applied after crop harvest in the fall and long term average manure characteristics are compiled in table s1 the cumulative nitrogen loading since 1973 on each plot is shown in fig 2 to investigate soil nutrient persistence over time manure application on specific plots was gradually discontinued prior to the 1987 1990 and 2003 growing seasons while some plots are continuing to receive manure applications fig 2 furthermore as part of a separate study the top 15 cm of the soil profile was removed from seven of the eight plots 4 on the extreme west non irrigated and 3 on the extreme east end irrigated that ceased manure application in 1990 fig 2 soil at the site has been described as a well drained dark brown chernozemic clay loam soil chang and entz 1996 miller et al 2002 or haplic kastanozem in the food and agriculture organization fao soil classification system geologic mapping indicates that the uppermost bedrock near the site is the belly river group consisting of oldman and foremost formations mossop and shetsen 1994 in much of southern alberta quaternary till overlies the upper cretaceous bedrock hendry et al 1986 and in the region of the site maps show quaternary sediment thickness of 40 50 m atkinson and lyster 2010 the field site is relatively flat with a slight slope 0 008 toward the southeast local climate data 1981 2010 measured at the aafc lethbridge station show annual average precipitation of 380 mm of which 112 mm is snowfall environment and climate change canada climate normals 2017 regional climate is classified as cold semi arid with important water deficit during the growing season at lethbridge average barley crop evapotranspiration etc of 365 mm greatly exceeds the average growing season precipitation of 182 mm for barley bennett et al 2014 since the beginning of the ltm study in 1973 the irrigated field has received approximately 150 mm of irrigation each year via a semi stationary sprinkler pipe system in 2016 a total of 222 mm of irrigation water was applied on three separate dates between june 20 and july 6 while 127 mm total irrigation was applied in 2017 on four dates between june 20 and july 19 the crops grown during the 2016 and 2017 field seasons were soybean and barley respectively 3 methods 3 1 groundwater monitoring groundwater monitoring was conducted using the existing aafc network of 32 monitoring wells designated mw 1 to mw 32 and 10 piezometers designated p22 1 to p22 8 the wells were installed between 1973 and 1990 and are fully screened across the water table to the base of each well well depths ranged from 3 0 to 6 0 m below ground surface mbgs with the majority ranging between 5 and 6 mbgs the 10 piezometers were installed on the irrigated field in 2002 fig 1 as a vertical nest with 0 4 m screened intervals bottoming out at depths ranging from 0 9 to 4 8 mbgs i e spaced every 0 5 m vertically six of the original 32 wells and one piezometer p22 8 were either missing or too damaged to be used and were therefore omitted from this study groundwater elevations were monitored at 2 h intervals using pressure transducers 13 onset hobo 4 solinst levelogger installed in select monitoring wells fig 1 and later corrected for barometric pressure effects using barometric and earth tide correction betco software toll and rasmussen 2007 horizontal groundwater flow directions were estimated by kriging measured groundwater elevation data using surfer 8 golden software to assist with subsequent nitrogen loading estimates see section 3 4 horizontal groundwater flow vectors were calculated monthly june 2016 to june 2017 on the day prior to groundwater sampling field saturated hydraulic conductivity k estimates were obtained from single well response slug bail tests on all suitable monitoring wells i e 20 of 26 wells where slug insertion was feasible water levels during the slug bail tests were recorded at one minute intervals using pressure transducers and data were analyzed using aqtesolv software following the method of hvorslev 1951 and butler 1998 groundwater samples were regularly collected in 13 sampling events from june 2016 to december 2017 prior to sampling all wells and piezometers were either purged of approximately three well volumes or were purged dry for slowly recovering wells sampled the following day groundwater samples were collected with a peristaltic pump placed in clean 500 ml polyethylene bottles and stored in a cooler on ice for transport samples were filtered to 0 45 μm in the laboratory immediately after collection samples were analyzed for selected anions nitrate chloride sulphate using a dionex ics 1000 ion chromatography system and total nitrogen tn and dissolved organic carbon doc analysis was performed on shimadzu tn and toc analyzers additional groundwater samples were collected on four dates feb 13 mar 20 jun 29 and oct 13 2017 for stable isotope analysis samples were submitted to the university of calgary isotope science laboratory for analysis of δ15n 78 samples and δ18o 64 samples in nitrate using the denitrifier technique isotope ratios expressed in delta notation δ were calculated relative to the international n2 and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standards for 15n and 18o respectively the expected analytical accuracies were 0 5 for δ15n no3 and 1 0 for δ18o no3 additional details regarding the groundwater monitoring including well construction water levels hydraulic conductivity estimates and analysis procedures are available in kyte 2018 3 2 soil sampling and testing on august 29 2016 six vertical soil cores were collected to 1 5 m depth at borehole locations denoted bh 01 to bh 06 adjacent to wells mw 18 22 16 08 02 and 05 using a truck mounted direct push rig fig 1 soil samples were collected at depth intervals of 0 15 15 30 30 45 45 60 60 90 90 120 and 120 150 cm bgs for each location selected samples were analyzed for particle size malvern mastersizer2000 soil bulk density hao et al 2008 and soil water retention characteristics reynolds and topp 2008 soil properties are listed in table 1 with the soil water retention data fitted to the model of van genuchten 1980 3 3 groundwater recharge estimation the water table fluctuation wtf method which links changes in groundwater storage to water table fluctuations healy and cook 2002 was used to estimate recharge on the study site the wtf method is suitable for unconfined aquifers that show sharp water table rises following precipitation and irrigation events healy and cook 2002 such as the current study site more importantly consideration of vadose zone flow mechanisms is not required for applying the method recharge r m for each water table rise event was calculated at all 17 well locations where pressure transducers were installed fig 1 using 1 r s y h where sy is the specific yield unitless and δh is the change in water table elevation m over the event period corrected for any observed long term water table recession due to the dependence of specific yield on water table depth which is particularly relevant for the fine grained sediments at this study site specific yield was calculated from the cheng et al 2015 method as 2 s y θ s h 1 h 2 θdh h 2 h 1 where θs m3 m3 is the saturated soil water content θ m3 m3 is soil water content under steady state conditions h1 m is the initial ground height above the water table i e initial water table depth and h2 m is the new equilibrium ground height above the water table i e final water table depth specific yield was estimated based on site water table conditions and measured soil water retention data fitted to the van genuchten 1980 model table 1 yielding values ranging from 0 050 to 0 083 3 4 cumulative nitrogen loading cumulative mass of nitrogen applied mt kg n to each field plot from 1973 to 2017 was calculated using the following equation 3 m t j m a p t where jm kg n m2 yr is the annual nitrogen loading rate to the plot ap m2 is the plot area and t is the length of time yr manure has been applied to each plot jm was calculated as the product of the reported total nitrogen composition of manure table s1 and the annual manure loading rate kg m2 yr of each respective plot in these calculations the nitrogen composition of manure was converted from dry weight basis to wet weight basis using the reported average water content of manure the original ltm experiment included termination of manure loading on selected plots at years 1987 1990 and 2003 fig 2 thus reducing the total n load on certain plots with time when some fraction of the nitrogen applied to or present in the soil zone is leached down to the water table it is often transported laterally in groundwater to downgradient monitoring wells which can be used under the right conditions to quantify nitrate loading to groundwater malekani et al 2018 as such soil manure loading can influence nitrate levels in downgradient monitoring wells and we attempted to use groundwater flow information to evaluate the impact of historical manure loading on groundwater nitrate levels to link manure loading to specific wells horizontal groundwater flow vectors were calculated monthly throughout the study period to determine which upgradient manure loading plot most directly contributed to each groundwater monitoring well fig 2 the manure loading from the nearest plot hydraulically upgradient of the well was assigned to each well in cases where the groundwater flow direction varied throughout the study period a weighted average of the manure application rate on the different upgradient plots was used for the cumulative nitrogen loading calculations 3 5 nitrogen leaching the mass of nitrogen leaching at each monitoring well location beneath the ltm plots was determined between june 9 2016 and december 14 2017 from the time varying groundwater recharge estimates and the corresponding measured nitrate concentrations for each discrete groundwater recharge event mass of nitrogen leached expressed as g n m2 was calculated by multiplying the groundwater recharge estimated from the wtf method by the measured groundwater nitrate concentration from the nearest sampling date cumulative n leaching was obtained by summing the discrete event values over specific seasons or the full study period monitoring wells mw 06 09 and 14 went dry on occasion and were excluded from the calculations due to missing sampling events 3 6 generalized additive mixed model analysis generalized additive mixed models gamms are regression models that use non linear smooth functions of select predictor variables or covariates to assess relationships with a chosen response variable woods 2006 mellor and cey 2015 in the gamm analysis for this study groundwater nitrate concentration was the response variable while chosen covariates included water table depth groundwater temperature recharge amount spatial location elapsed time since the beginning of study doc c n ratio doc no3 n average 15n at each well location and cumulative nitrogen loading since 1973 the gamm analysis was also repeated with chloride concentrations as the response variable gamms were chosen for this study because they allow for random effects that can help correct for the lack of independence between covariates first order autoregressive correlation structure ar1 was used to model the spatial and temporal autocorrelations and individual well locations were used as random effects to remove any influence that spatial effects between wells or the repeated sampling of a specific well had on the data 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater levels and flow over the two growing seasons groundwater elevations were generally highest in the northern portion of the site and lowest in the south yielding a general groundwater flow direction from north to south fig 3 seasonal and annual changes in water table elevations resulted in changes in horizontal groundwater flow directions across the field site specific to the ltm site and study duration were high groundwater elevations in mw1 influenced and maintained by the close proximity of a water filled dugout which unintendedly affected local groundwater flow as a result on the western non irrigated field the average groundwater flow direction remained steady toward the southeast fig 3 on the eastern irrigated field however groundwater mounding due to irrigation considerably affected the flow direction most notably during the 2016 growing season following the onset of monitoring early june 2016 not shown groundwater elevations rose significantly underneath the irrigated side within a month fig s1c and d in response to a total of 222 mm of irrigation jun 20 jul 6 and additional 63 mm jul 13 28 of precipitation that followed out of 120 mm from jun aug for the same period groundwater levels increased under the non irrigated side in response to precipitation although to lesser heights than observed under irrigation fig s1b the localized mounding resulted in a flow divide beneath the irrigated field such that part of the flow was directed west toward the non irrigated field while the remaining flow was directed westbound outside the treatment zone boundary fig 3a mounding was sufficient to induce a horizontal hydraulic gradient reversal on the northwestern portion of the irrigated area groundwater levels declined during the 2016 2017 winter period and mounding slowly subsided fig 3b similar groundwater flow patterns and mounding under the irrigated side were observed in the 2017 growing season fig 3c however mound heights and extent were lessened because both growing season precipitation 79 mm jun aug and irrigation 127 mm jun 20 jul 19 were lower in 2017 hydraulic conductivity values estimated from single well tests ranged from 8 10 8 to 1 10 10 m s fig s2 the smallest k values were measured near wells mw 03 04 and 19 beneath the non irrigated field while the largest k values wells mw 29 27 22 23 and 14 were generally located beneath irrigated plots and the buffer area south of the ltm plots fig s2 horizontal hydraulic gradients were consistently largest near the northwestern boundary of the study area 0 030 while gradients were lowest near mw 19 0 002 the area with the lowest hydraulic conductivity fig s2 similarly specific discharge darcy flux ranged from 1 10 9 m s near mw 01 to 2 10 12 m s near mw 19 across the site the maximum and minimum horizontal groundwater flow velocities for the site calculated using the site average porosity of 0 50 table 1 were 2 10 9 m s 0 06 m year and 4 10 12 m s 0 0001 m year the average vertical gradient of 0 26 was measured in the piezometer nest on the irrigated field vertical k was not calculated in this study so the horizontal k estimated from slug tests was used to calculate specific discharge vertical specific discharge was estimated to be 8 10 9 m s resulting in a vertical average groundwater flow velocity of 2 10 8 m s 0 5 m year the total magnitude of groundwater recharge calculated using the wtf method from june 2016 to october 2017 averaged 288 mm for the irrigated wells n 6 and 125 mm for the non irrigated wells n 8 table 2 for comparison a simple water balance p et0 technique yielded similar results with recharge values of 225 mm beneath the irrigated plots and 96 mm beneath the non irrigated plots over the same period data not shown see kyte 2018 seasonal groundwater recharge was greatest during the summer months jun aug in both irrigation and non irrigated locations for the entire 2016 2017 study period 97 of irrigated area recharge and 75 of the non irrigated area recharge collectively occurred during the growing season periods table 2 olson et al 2009 found a similar result studying nitrate leaching in two irrigated field sites about 30 km northeast of the current study site with annual peak water table levels occurring from late june to august for the small fraction of remaining recharge the majority was associated with spring snowmelt events late mar early apr 2017 for both the irrigated and non irrigated wells growing season jun aug recharge was driven by precipitation and irrigation conditions particularly their temporal rate and distribution table 2 for the two growing seasons estimated recharge on the non irrigated field was 60 7 mm in 2016 and 33 6 mm in 2017 table 2 representing 51 and 43 of each seasons precipitation recharge was much greater for the irrigated field with 227 5 mm in jun aug 2016 67 of p i due to large and closely distributed irrigations applied in early summer precipitation and irrigation were both considerably reduced in the 2017 growing season resulting in recharge of 52 6 mm 26 of p i below the irrigated field multiple year observations would be needed for assessing the effects of annual climate variability on recharge and other processes influencing recharge at this site 4 2 groundwater quality groundwater nitrate and chloride concentrations are presented in fig 4 and mapped in fig 5 across all 26 long screened wells mean nitrate n was 118 mg n l and ranged from below the detection limit 0 1 mg n l to 1350 mg n l while mean chloride was 237 mg l and ranged from 1 7 mg l to 1932 mg l fig 4a from the same 26 wells 18 had nitrate concentrations greater than the drinking water guideline of 10 mg n l health canada 2012 within the nine vertically nested piezometers on the irrigated field concentrations ranged between 236 and 708 mg n l for nitrate and between 289 and 1423 mg l for chloride fig 4a concentrations in the piezometer nest were generally higher than the long screen monitoring wells fig 4a however the piezometer concentrations were consistent with the closest individual monitoring well mw 22 fig 1 the spatial distributions of nitrate n and chloride average over all events concentrations exhibited similar patterns fig 5 with the highest concentrations beneath the irrigated field toward the boundary with the non irrigated field mw12 no3 n 706 mg l cl 1139 mg l and along the southern boundary mw22 no3 n 618 mg l cl 1123 mg l similarly concentrations were higher on average beneath irrigated plots no3 n 240 mg l cl 434 mg l than non irrigated plots no3 n 89 mg l cl 191 mg l figs 4b and 5 concentrations in the sentinel wells defined here as wells located outside the ltm experiment area boundaries were lowest with mean values of 11 mg n l for nitrate and 65 mg l for chloride fig 4b the differences between means for all three data groups irrigated non irrigated and sentinel wells were found to be significantly different based on the kruskal wallis test p 10 16 while groundwater nitrate contamination in agricultural areas around the world is common few studies have reported nitrate concentrations as high as this study site as a comparator 5100 groundwater wells in the united states were tested for nitrate from 1991 to 2003 and those samples collected from shallow groundwater beneath agricultural land had a median groundwater nitrate concentration of 3 1 mg n l burow et al 2010 similarly in prince edward island canada where agricultural activities occur on almost half of the island s land area mean groundwater nitrate concentrations were 3 99 mg n l benson et al 2006 another study in the battersea area of southern alberta which has the highest density of livestock in alberta reported 583 groundwater samples having an overall mean concentration of 18 mg n l kohn et al 2016 the ltm study is unique in that it shows shallow groundwater nitrate concentrations immediately beneath a long term source of nitrate contamination with relatively high rates of manure application which were based largely on historical manure land disposal practices rather than current practices where manure n loading is matched to crop nutrient requirements when combined with irrigation induced leaching and low permeability sediments the result is higher than typical groundwater nitrate concentrations nevertheless the ltm plots are still relevant for assessing factors affecting groundwater contamination notably the long term accumulation of excess soil nitrogen whether from manure or inorganic fertilizers common in many regions and impacts from any reductions in nitrogen loading the distribution of groundwater nitrate contamination corresponded directly with the cumulative nitrogen loading from manure as applied on plots upgradient of each well fig 6 this relationship between manure loading and elevated nitrate in groundwater is supported by several studies in the region riddell and rodvang 1992 rodvang et al 2004 olson et al 2009 riddell and rodvang 1992 reported that manure application rates between 60 and 155 t ha increased the frequency of nitrate in groundwater above the drinking water standard and rodvang et al 2004 showed that agricultural intensity including manure usage affected shallow groundwater nitrate levels in southern alberta examining the groundwater nitrate and chloride plumes fig 5 there has been relatively little lateral migration of the plumes from where the manure loading initially occurred this is expected due to the low hydraulic conductivity sediments at the site fig s2 which allow for a maximum of approximately 2 m of lateral nitrate or chloride transport over the 44 years since the manure loading began when accounting for advection alone while the effects of diffusion were not quantified it is important to note that diffusion can be an important transport mechanism in low permeability sediments like those found at this site sulphate and doc were also analyzed in this study mainly to assess potential electron donors in relevant redox reactions which will be discussed in later sections the average doc mg l in the 278 samples collected throughout the study period was 30 mg l with a range from 6 4 to 94 mg l sulphate concentrations at the site are naturally elevated in the glacial sediments of the region with mean value of 3609 mg l range from 419 to 10 490 mg l over 283 samples 4 3 nitrogen leaching nitrogen no3 n mass leached to groundwater during this study is presented in table 2 and showed considerable seasonal variability driven largely by the observed groundwater recharge variability the vast majority of nitrate leaching occurred during the growing season jun aug with 98 of nitrogen leached during the combined 2016 and 2017 growing seasons non growing season nitrogen leaching was limited due to lower groundwater recharge during winter of 2017 sep 2016 to may 2017 resulting in an estimated 2 of nitrogen leached from the irrigated field during this period 0 below the non irrigated field predictably over the full study period 23 times greater total nitrogen mass was leached beneath the irrigated area 119 9 mg n m2 than the non irrigated areas 5 0 mg n m2 owing to the greater recharge rates table 2 arising from irrigation combined with relatively high nitrate concentrations fig 5a calculations indicated considerable variability in nitrogen mass leached at different well locations which can generally be explained by spatial variability of manure loading rates as well as manure application duration in the ltm experiment see fig 2 in areas where manure was still being applied seasonal leaching was evident in wells notably mw 05 90 mg n m2 mw 11 high nitrate but recharge not available for full period mw 18 36 mg n m2 and mw 22 185 mg n m2 nitrate and chloride concentrations generally increased following recharge events in these areas fig s1b indicating leaching of excess nitrogen stored in the vadose zone and resulting in an inverse relation between water table depths and nitrate concentrations fig 7 for other wells with ongoing manure application nearby leaching was low e g mw 03 or could not be quantified e g mw 06 14 19 wells located in areas downgradient of the manure plots where manure application ceased in 2003 i e mw 04 12 and 20 also showed substantial amounts of nitrogen leaching despite no current manure application mw 12 289 mg n m2 and mw 20 118 mg n m2 had some of the highest leaching while mw 04 7 mg n m2 showed less leaching likely due to being situated near the upgradient boundary in an area of lower hydraulic conductivity fig s2 evidence of nitrate leaching in locations where manure is no longer being applied supports the idea that nitrogen stored in the soil from past manure applications can sustain elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations due to continued n mineralization and leaching these results are similar to sebilo et al 2013 who observed that only 8 12 of 15n labeled tracer applied to agricultural soils leached toward the hydrosphere in their 30 year observation period while 12 15 remained available for future leaching similarly tomer and burkart 2003 concluded that heavy nitrogen loading between 1969 and 1974 affected groundwater nitrate concentrations in the watershed for another three decades inverse relations between water table depth i e measured as depth below ground surface immediately prior to sampling and nitrate concentrations were also observed at well locations mw 04 12 and 20 where manure application ceased in 2003 fig 7 but some temporal variability was noted for example mw 12 showed an increase in groundwater nitrate following a recharge event in july 2016 but concentrations decreased following smaller recharge events in summer of 2017 fig s1c in general water levels at this well location rose rapidly following precipitation and irrigation events indicating that preferential flow along macropores was likely a factor macropore flow can either a increase nitrogen leaching by allowing rapid transport to depth or b decrease nitrogen leaching by protecting nutrients in smaller matrix pores from being mobilized by recharge concentrated along macropores lehmann and schroth 2003 this apparently divergent behavior could explain why some recharge events decreased nitrate concentrations and other events resulted in increased nitrate but the exact cause cannot be determined and other factors such as seasonal groundwater mounding recession near the boundary between irrigated and non irrigated fields may have also played a role the relation between water table depth and nitrate concentration was less prevalent in well locations where manure application stopped prior to 1990 data not shown see kyte 2018 indicating less leaching of nitrate in recharge waters for example in mw 23 where manure application ceased and the top 15 cm soil was removed in 1990 recharge events resulted in a decrease in nitrate concentrations fig s1d due to dilution of the nitrate already present in groundwater this suggests that improvements in groundwater quality can be achieved in agricultural areas following reductions in fertilizer n or manure n inputs mann kendall tests were applied to site averaged nitrate and chloride concentrations to evaluate temporal trends throughout the study period fig 8 a negative mann kendall score p 0 003 indicated that nitrate n concentrations decreased significantly with time from the first sampling event on june 23 2016 136 mg n l to the final sampling event on december 13 2017 67 mg n l fig 8 similarly chloride concentrations decreased significantly throughout the study period p 0 005 these decreases in nitrate and chloride concentrations could be due to either a net decrease in the amount of leaching throughout the study period or a longer term trend associated with the reduction of manure loading across the site over decadal time scales the first explanation is plausible since the largest groundwater recharge and nitrogen leaching events occurred near the beginning of the study period july 2016 and nitrate concentrations may be expected to decline over time due to the relative lack of further large leaching events combined with the presence of natural dilution and attenuation processes a second explanation for the decreasing groundwater nitrate and chloride concentrations is the reduced manure loads due to the cessation of manure application on selected plots over time in 1987 manure application ceased on one third of all plots with further cessations of applied manure on selected plots in 1990 and 2003 fig 2 trend analyses were completed on individual wells and the results showed a significantly p 0 05 or lower decreasing trend for nitrate concentrations in wells mw 04 12 and 20 where manure application ceased in 2003 similarly the decreasing trend was also significant in well locations mw 07 and mw 23 where manure loading ceased prior to 1990 but where loading rates were initially high 180 kg ha and 120 kg ha respectively fig 1 wells under ongoing manure treatment namely mw 02 05 18 19 and 22 did not show a significant decreasing trend through time with the exception of mw 11 these results suggest that the decreasing trend in site averaged groundwater nitrate concentrations is most likely controlled by the cessation of manure application on select ltm plots the evidence shows that reducing manure loading can have a positive effect on groundwater quality but for the site flow conditions and loading history the benefits will be slow to materialize with adverse effects to shallow groundwater quality for many years or decades following application data shows high nitrate concentrations were maintained in locations where manure has not been applied for decades i e 2003 or earlier several locations where the top 15 cm of soil was stripped and annual manure applications stopped as early as 1990 e g mw 7 and mw 23 had relatively modest nitrogen leaching owing to the increased time since the last manure application yet nitrate concentrations remain elevated above the acceptable drinking water guideline since cumulative nitrogen loading has a strong relationship with current groundwater nitrate concentrations fig 6 it will be a critical factor in controlling long term nitrogen leaching continuing observations from long term experiments such as the ltm plot study will be helpful when establishing bmps for similar agricultural areas in the future 4 4 isotopic analysis of nitrate isotopic δ15n composition of groundwater nitrate ranged between 9 1 and 81 9 with an average of 28 5 n 72 the δ18o of nitrate ranged between 5 5 and 30 5 with the average being 5 2 n 61 a dual isotope plot fig 9a confirms the primary source of nitrate in shallow groundwater at the ltm site was manure since most samples either plotted within or to the right of the sewage manure signature region nikolenko et al 2017 apart from the distinct source signature fig 9a also indicates a likely denitrification process for well data where an increase in both δ18o and δ15n are evident marked with an arrow and δ15n no3 enrichment extends beyond the typical 10 25 manure signature fig 9a denitrification is inferred to potentially occur in 16 of 26 well locations where δ15n no3 values were 25 during at least one of the four sampling events from february to october 2017 fig 9b seven wells had δ15n no3 values exceeding 25 during all sampling events mw 02 08 16 19 26 28 29 and were largely situated on the perimeter of the ltm experiment site surrounding regions with the highest nitrate levels when comparing δ15n no3 and the no3 n values for all samples fig 9b elevated δ15n no3 values 25 occur at lower nitrate n concentrations while higher nitrate n concentrations do not display elevated δ15n no3 values suggesting denitrification may be effective at this site for limiting the spatial extent of nitrate contamination controls on groundwater nitrate and the role of denitrification can also be evaluated using the combined nitrate and chloride data sets mariotti et al 1988 bourke et al 2019 given that groundwater chloride and nitrate were derived from manure in this case we would expect to see a consistent no3 n cl ratio both spatially and temporally if no attenuation were occurring alternately denitrification causes a decrease in both nitrate concentrations and no3 n cl ratios together with a corresponding theoretical exponential increase in 15n of residual nitrate mariotti et al 1988 thus the inverse linear relationship between log no3 n cl and δ15n no3 in samples collected from mar oct 2017 fig 10 points to denitrification at certain locations across the site those wells with the highest no3 n cl ratios e g mw 18 22 represent the source of the nitrate plume where n leaching was greatest whereas wells with lower no3 n cl ratios e g mw 29 32 located on the perimeter were the product of nitrate attenuation by denitrification as expected the relationship is not perfectly linear and some wells such as mw 08 and mw 32 diverged slightly from this trend at times likely due to their peripheral location and therefore being affected by mixing with lower nitrate waters from surrounding areas the obvious exceptions to this relationship were wells mw 01 03 09 and 17 located in areas hydraulically upgradient of the ltm plots fig 10 which have therefore not been affected by manure application to the same degree and are considered zones of limited nitrate leaching mw 02 despite being located in the same general area as these upgradient wells fig 2 behaves differently as a result of the manure loading plot immediately to the west which still receives manure applications and the groundwater flow vectors follow a principally eastern flow direction consequently mw 02 has relatively high 15n values indicating some potential for denitrification despite relatively low nitrate concentrations the carbon nitrogen c n ratio in groundwater at this site can explain the controls on denitrification a positive correlation between groundwater c n ratios and 15n enrichment was observed fig 11 indicating that carbon was likely an electron donor for denitrification the four upgradient wells noted earlier mw 01 03 09 and 17 see fig 10 were again the exceptions due to very low nitrate concentrations meaning denitrification was nitrate limited the wells with the highest c n ratios and 15n enrichment namely mw 02 08 16 28 and 29 were predominantly outside the manure application area fig 1 the increased doc relative to nitrate at these locations could be due to the mixing with higher c n waters from outside the ltm plots emphasizing that carbon availability is likely an important control on denitrification potential while the relationship between 15n enrichment and c n supports the importance of organic carbon as an electron donor in this study more comprehensive analysis of carbon and sulphur isotopes vitòria et al 2008 could elucidate if other electron donors were involved in denitrification in the site groundwater including pyrite fes2 which is an effective electron donor in reduced glacial deposits in southern alberta rodvang et al 2014 rodvang and ryan 2011 4 5 generalized additive mixed models not surprisingly results from the gamm analysis showed that cumulative nitrogen loading from manure was the most dominant control on groundwater nitrate concentrations p 10 12 fig 12a table 3 nitrogen loading also showed a significant effect p 10 12 on chloride concentrations table 3 since both nitrate and chloride were sourced from manure application the non linear shape of the smooth function for nitrogen loading fig 12a shows that a threshold nitrogen loading value exists below which there is little influence on groundwater nitrate concentrations above about 20 000 kg n ha the steeper slope of fig 12a indicates that cumulative nitrogen loading beyond this level resulted in increased groundwater nitrate concentrations note that the gamm analysis did not explicitly consider any time varying component to n loading rates such as manure application on selected plots ceasing at different times but longer manure loading durations are nevertheless reflected in increased cumulative n loading rates alberta agriculture and forestry aaf reported the upper limit for the recommended nitrogen application rate to barley crops under irrigated conditions to be 146 kg ha alberta agriculture and forestry 2004 which corresponds to a cumulative total of 6380 kg ha for the entire 44 year study period cumulative manure loading of 20 000 kg ha is over three times the aaf recommended rate and this excessive manure loading clearly leads to increased nitrate leaching and groundwater contamination doc and sulphate were investigated with the goal to better understand the controls on denitrification at the ltm plots in the gamm analysis doc had a significant positive relationship with nitrate concentrations in groundwater p 1 8 10 4 fig 12b table 3 which is consistent with organic carbon as an electron donor during denitrification korom 1992 a positive correlation however was also observed between doc and chloride in groundwater p 1 1 10 3 table 3 although this relationship was weaker than that between nitrate and doc it indicates that the correlations between carbon nitrate and chloride are likely due to all three being sourced from manure reduced sulphur such as pyrite has previously been reported as a common electron donor for denitrification in southern alberta rodvang et al 2014 rodvang and ryan 2011 and results in an increase in sulphate while nitrate is consumed the gamm analysis revealed however there was no significant relationship between nitrate and sulphate concentrations fig 12d but such a relation could be masked by the naturally high sulphate concentrations in glacial till of southern alberta hendry et al 1986 the gamm analysis confirmed the trend of decreasing nitrate and chloride concentrations over the study period time measured in days since the beginning of the study had a significant negative effect on nitrate p 2 10 3 and chloride p 4 10 4 in groundwater even when other key covariates like nitrogen loading and spatial location were considered nitrate concentrations tended to increase slightly with reductions in water table depth data not shown which is consistent with leaching of nitrogen from the root zone above but the gamm analysis indicated that the effect was not significant for nitrate or chloride concentrations in groundwater table 3 5 conclusions the long term 44 yr nature of manure nitrogen loading in this study is unprecedented in the literature yielding crucial insights into groundwater pollution risks and mitigating factors regular groundwater monitoring over an 18 month period revealed nitrate concentrations were much higher beneath irrigated plots 240 mg n l than non irrigated plots 89 mg n l and sentinel well locations 11 mg n l due to the differing manure loading regimes and increased leaching potential under irrigation more than 20 times greater nitrate leaching beneath the irrigated field points to the critical importance of irrigation and crop water management practices cumulative manure loading was the most important control on groundwater nitrate contamination but this study was also unique in demonstrating how ceasing manure application can influence groundwater nitrate potentially lowering concentrations over the longer term a key implication is that soil management practices need to consider long term n mineralization potential along with total nitrogen loading to protect groundwater quality site averaged nitrate concentrations trended significantly downward due in part to reductions in manure loading and similarly nitrate concentrations in individual wells often reflected the cessation or continued application of manure in upgradient plots collectively the data suggest that where a long legacy of n loading is present improvements in water quality from reduced n loading are achievable but the improvements may take decades to materialize due to the long lag times involved while nitrogen loading was the primary control on groundwater nitrate distributions natural attenuation of nitrate was also important at this site denitrification was inferred to occur in 16 of 26 wells based on 15n no3 isotope values as well as no3 n cl ratios with the strongest denitrification signals recorded in sentinel wells near the perimeter of the field site where manure was never applied denitrification in these locations was likely related to the increase in doc from mixing with carbon rich waters coming from outside the ltm plots increasing 15n no3 with increasing c n ratios revealed that organic carbon was likely the dominant electron donor for denitrification therefore management strategies that increase doc in groundwater may help mitigate nitrate contamination in agricultural areas with similar environmental geochemical and hydrogeological conditions

1204,we here propose a two step approach based simulation optimization model for multi objective groundwater remediation using enhanced random vector functional link ervfl and evolutionary marine predator algorithm empa in this study groundwater flow and solute transport models are developed using modflow and mt3dms the ervfl network is used to approximate the flow and transport models enhancing the computational performance this study also improves the robustness of the ervfl network using a kernel density estimator kde based weighted least square approach we further develop the empa by modifying the marine predator algorithm mpa using elite opposition based learning biological evolution operators and elimination mechanisms in the multi objective version of empa the non dominated pareto optimal solutions are stored in an external repository using an archive controller and adaptive grid mechanism to promote better convergence and diversity of the pareto front the proposed methodologies are applied for multi objective groundwater remediation of a hypothetical unconfined aquifer based on the two step method the first step directly integrates flow and transport models with empa and finds the optimal locations of pumping wells by minimizing the percent of contaminant mass remaining in the aquifer in the second step the ervl based proxy model is integrated with empa and used for multi objective optimization while explicitly using the pumping well locations obtained in the first step the multi objective optimization generates a pareto optimal solution representing the relationship between the rate of pumping and the amount of contaminant mass in the aquifer further analyses show a significant advantage of the two step approach over a traditional method for multi objective groundwater remediation keywords groundwater remediation multi objective optimization enhanced random vector functional link ervfl evolutionary marine predator algorithm empa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the pump and treat pat is a physical method of extracting contaminated groundwater to the earth s surface and treating the water with a filtering system to remove harmful contaminants in the last several decades the simulation optimization so models have been extensively used for designing pat based systems to remediate groundwater bear and sun 1998 erickson et al 2002 guan and aral 1999 majumder and lu 2021 mckinney and lin 1994 pang and shoemaker 2023 seyedpour 2019 yang et al 2022 2013 simulation models are generally developed by using the finite difference method fdm or finite element method fem to solve flow and transport equations fitts 2002 in an so model the simulation model is executed by the optimization model repeatedly many thousands of times to find optimal values of the control parameters i e pumping locations extraction rates injection rates of the pat system jiang and na 2020 majumder and eldho 2020 majumder and lu 2021 mckinney and lin 1996 1994 however the repeated execution of a computationally expensive simulation model in the so approach often leads to enormous computational costs majumder and lu 2021 zhao et al 2020 therefore many prior studies constructed a data driven surrogate proxy simulator of a computationally costly simulation model to enhance computational performance jiang and na 2020 the most common surrogates applied in the field of groundwater studies are polynomial regression he et al 2008 huang et al 2003 qin et al 2007 kriging hemker et al 2008 zhang et al 2022 artificial neural network majumder and eldho 2020 qaderi and babanezhad 2017 rogers and dowla 1994 yan and minsker 2006 support vector machine ch et al 2013 and extreme learning machine jiang et al 2015 majumder and lu 2021 yadav et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 in the kriging surrogate the solution may get stuck in the local optima when the values of the distance constraints are small zhao et al 2020 for the support vector machine the accuracy of the solutions largely depends on the selection of an appropriate kernel function and several other hyperparameters raghavendra and deka 2014 however finding the values of hyperparameters for the support vector machine is a trial and error process that is often time consuming raghavendra and deka 2014 a recent study on groundwater remediation also claimed that the generalization ability of elm is better than svm in approximating flow and transport models yadav et al 2016 furthermore elm is computationally more efficient than the support vector machine and artificial neural network yadav et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 alternatively the random vector functional link rvfl network can be used as a proxy simulator due to its universal approximation ability of any continuous function with compact input output datasets and high computational performance elaziz et al 2020 scardapane et al 2015 zhang and suganthan 2016 the network structure of rvfl is quite similar to the extreme learning machine elm and single layer ffnn except for a direct link between the input layer and the output layer pao et al 1994 such direct links between the input and output layers are standard practice in neural networks to avoid over fitting issues during the training phase pao et al 1994 in rvfl the hidden layer thresholds and input weights are randomly sampled from a uniform distribution and the output weights are computed by minimizing a loss function using moore penrose pseudo inverse or ridge regression zhang and suganthan 2016 the rvfl network shows better generalization ability and superior computational efficiency than the svm and single layer ffnn zhang and suganthan 2016 nevertheless the training dataset with outliers may reduce the generalization ability of the rvfl network this issue can be resolved by incorporating the weighted least square wls approach in the rvfl network where weights can be computed using the kernel density estimator kde dai et al 2015 some of the popular single objective optimization methods for groundwater management and remediation are cat swarm optimization cso majumder and eldho 2016 genetic algorithm ga mckinney and lin 1994 particle swarm optimization pso ch et al 2013 grey wolf optimizer gwo majumder and eldho 2020 simulated annealing sa kuo et al 1992 differential evolution de redoloza and li 2021 harmony search hs tamer ayvaz 2009 and covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy cma es smaoui et al 2018 nevertheless for real field groundwater remediation the decision makers may encounter multiple conflicting objectives such as minimizing cleanup time minimizing health risks minimizing the cost of remediation minimizing pumping rates minimizing the quantity of contaminant in the aquifer and maximizing reliability erickson et al 2002 majumder and lu 2021 yang et al 2013 in the traditional groundwater remediation approach multiple objectives are lumped together with user defined weights to form a single objective optimization problem erickson et al 2002 yang et al 2017 another standard method of dealing with multiple objectives is to minimize maximize one of the objectives while keeping other objectives as constraints erickson et al 2002 yang et al 2017 however a multi objective optimization problem with such over simplification only generates a single optimal solution instead of the trade off non dominated solutions between conflicting objectives erickson et al 2002 alternatively multi objective metaheuristics can be used for groundwater remediation to generate pareto optimal solutions for several conflicting objectives some of the most common multi objective metaheuristics for groundwater resources management and remediation are the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii kollat and reed 2006 mondal et al 2010 rezaei et al 2020 niched pareto tabu search npts yang et al 2017 2013 multi objective evolutionary algorithm piscopo et al 2015 multi objective particle swarm optimization jiang and na 2020 multi objective harmony search luo et al 2014 and shuffled complex evolution schaerlaekens et al 2006 2005 kollat and reed 2006 compared several multi objective metaheuristics for groundwater monitoring system design the comparative analysis showed the superiority of a modified nsga ii over moea for groundwater monitoring design recently a metaheuristic namely the marine predator algorithm mpa has been developed by emulating the cooperative hunting strategy of marine predators to capture prey faramarzi et al 2020 several unimodal multimodal and composite test functions were considered to evaluate the performances of mpa faramarzi et al 2020 liang et al 2005 for the selected test functions the performances of mpa were superior to various metaheuristics ga de sa and pso in terms of exploration and exploitation abilities faramarzi et al 2020 since its invention mpa has been getting much attention in many fields such as structural engineering electrical and power engineering and energy elaziz et al 2020 ridha 2020 sun et al 2020 the performance of mpa can be further improved by various strategies such as incorporating elite opposition based learning using biological evolution operators and applying elimination mechanisms majumder and lu 2021 wang and li 2019 determining the optimal pumping locations is crucial in designing an effective pat based groundwater remediation system huang and mayer 1997 wang and ahlfeld 1994 in many studies a fixed number of pumping wells are guessed along the centreline of the plume for groundwater remediation erickson et al 2002 jiang and na 2020 luo et al 2014 yang et al 2022 2017 2013 however determining optimal pumping location is not straightforward for highly heterogeneous aquifers guan and aral 1999 huang and mayer 1997 wang and ahlfeld 1994 many studies on groundwater remediation also considered the pumping well locations as decision variables in the optimization model bayer and finkel 2007 2004 guan and aral 1999 huang and mayer 1997 verardo et al 2021 wang and ahlfeld 1994 wang and ahlfeld 1994 and huang and mayer 1997 used a moving well approach where the pumping locations and pumping rates were explicitly considered as the decision variables in the optimization model wang and ahlfeld 1994 identified optimal pumping location by moving each pumping well within the aquifer domain as a continuous function of space as the pumping well moves in the aquifer domain the pumping rate is distributed as a continuous function of the spatial domain using hermite interpolation functions wang and ahlfeld 1994 rizzo and dougherty 1996 used a combinatorial optimization method to find optimal pumping locations from a large number of discrete candidate pumping locations in the aquifer domain recently a two step method was proposed for the remediation of contaminated groundwater that segregates a single objective optimization problem into two management models majumder and lu 2021 in the first management model a combinatorial optimization method is used to find optimal locations by minimizing the quantity of pollutant mass in the aquifer domain the first management model used a predefined pumping rate 150 m3 day which is the same for all pumping wells the optimal pumping locations found in the first step were used explicitly in the second step for finding optimal extraction rates for the remediation of groundwater majumder and lu 2021 also found that the two step approach is computationally very efficient and highly accurate for single objective groundwater remediation however the effectiveness of the two step method was not evaluated for multi objective groundwater remediation motivated by this the present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the two step method for multi objective groundwater remediation this study also methodologically modified the random vector functional link rvfl and marine predator algorithm mpa which is in an attempt to develop a better so model for the remediation of groundwater both the rvfl and mpa have never been used in the past for groundwater remediation in this study the modified algorithms are named as the enhanced random vector functional link ervfl and evolutionary marine predator algorithm empa the ervfl network uses the weighted least squares wls method based on the kernel density estimator to improve the algorithm s robustness the empa is the modified version of mpa with elite opposition based learning biological evolution operator and elimination mechanism in the multi objective version of empa the non dominated solutions are stored in a repository using the archive controller and adaptive grid mechanism the proposed methodologies are applied for multi objective groundwater remediation using the two step method 2 methodology this study uses the modflow and mt3dms codes for solving the subsurface flow and transport equations harbaugh and arlen 2005 zheng and wang 1999 further a proxy model based on the ervfl network is developed for approximating flow and transport models this study also proposes empa for designing groundwater remediation strategies the detailed methodologies of ervfl and empa are discussed below 2 1 random vector functional link rvfl the rvfl is a feed forward network having a single hidden layer connecting the input and output layers fig 1 additionally the output layer and input layer are also directly connected to help avoid overfitting issues and improve performance during the training phase pao et al 1994 vuković et al 2018 let us consider a distinct input output dataset of dimensions n d and can be represented as eq 1 1 x j y j ℜ n ℜ m j 1 2 n d where x j and y j are the input and output datasets and can be represented as 2a x j x j 1 x j 2 x j 3 x j 4 x jn n t r n 2b y j y j 1 y j 2 y j 3 y j 4 y jm m t r m in rvfl one fraction of the output is predicted by functional mapping of generic input x j to a linear combination of a fixed number l of nonlinear transformations of the input itself the other fraction of the output is predicted using the direct link between the input and the output layer eq 3 vuković et al 2018 3 o j i 1 l β i f w i x j b i k 1 n β k x j j 1 2 n d where l is the total hidden

the norm of output weights and the norm of the loss function eq 5 5 minimize h β y 2 and β the eq 5 can be expressed as a regularized least square ridge regression problem in the following form eq 6 vuković et al 2018 6 min β ℜ l j β 1 2 h β y 2 2 1 2 λ β 2 2 where λ is known as the regularization factor which helps to minimize the variance in the prediction of output weights β gao et al 2022 by

lévy movements faramarzi et al 2020 using the velocity ratios between predator and prey the search processes of the mpa are divided into three phases elaziz et al 2020 2 3 1 exploration phase in the exploration phase predators explore the search space using high velocity brownian motion to find suitable prey eq 15 faramarzi et al 2020 15 x i t 1 x i t p c r r b x g t r b x i t 0 t 1 3 t max where t max is the maximum number of iterations x i t is the location of a candidate marine predator x i t 1 is the new location of a candidate marine predator x g t is the location of the best marine predator p c is the predator constant having value 0 5 r u 0 1 and r b n 0 1 2 3 2 transition phase in this phase the velocities of half of the marine predators are reduced using a parameter c f to exploit the search space the other half of the predators with higher velocities explore the search space a distribution factor p f u 0 1 is used to distribute the population for exploration and exploitation the position of a candidate predator is updated as faramarzi et al 2020 16a x i t 1 x i t p c r r l x g t 1 r l x i t if p f 0 5 1 3 t max t 2 3 t max 16b x i t 1 x g t p c c f r b r b x

predators are low due to using the parameter cf the position of a marine predator is updated using the equation below faramarzi et al 2020 17 x i t 1 x g t p c c f r l x g t 1 r l x i t where 2 3 t

marine predators faramarzi et al 2020 in a previous study it was reported that 80 of the time sharks spend in the surrounding area of fads and the rest of the time sharks make many long jumps in various directions to search for prey such behavior of sharks can be incorporated into the mpa algorithm to avoid entrapment in the local minima by considering eddy formation and fad the positions of a candidate marine predator are updated as faramarzi et al 2020 18a x i t 1 x i t c f x min r x max x min w if r f a d 18b x i t 1 x i t f ad 1 r r x r 1 x r 2 if r f a d where x min and x max are

mirjalili et al 2016 2 4 6 archive controller the archive controller controls the entry of non dominated solutions into the repository during the iteration process based on several conditions mirjalili et al 2016 a pictorial representation of several conditions of the archive controller is shown in fig 2 let us consider a non dominated solution n s willing to enter into the repository case 1 add n s into the external repository if the archive is empty case 2 if n s is dominated by one or more members in the external repository then discard n s case 3 if n s is not dominated by any member in the external repository then directly add it to the repository case 4 if one or more members in the external repository are dominated by n s then remove the dominated members and add n s to the repository 2 4 7 adaptive grid mechanism the purpose of the adaptive grid mechanism is to maintain diversity among non dominated solutions mirjalili et al 2016 case 5 if n s fulfill the criterion neither n s nor any individual in the repository dominates each other to enter into the external repository but the repository is full then invoke the adaptive grid mechanism to make space for the n s remove an individual from the most crowded repository segment using the roulette wheel selection method if n s lies outside the current bound of the grid then recalculate the grid and relocate each individual of the grid repository to accommodate n s removing individuals from the most crowded space of the repository helps improve the diversity of the pareto optimal solutions various parameters are used to implement the adaptive grid mechanism such as the grid inflation parameter α 0 1 the number of grids per each dimension n grid 20 the best individual selection pressure parameter β 4 and the repository individual selection parameter γ 2 liu et al 2020 2 4 8 selection of best individual the best individual selection mechanism chooses the least crowded segment of the search space using the roulette wheel selection method to emphasize better exploration mirjalili et al 2016 2 4 9 performance metrics in multi objective optimization performance metrics such as inverted generational distance igd spacing sp and maximum spread ms are used to check the convergence and diversity of the non dominated solutions with respect to the true pareto optimal solutions deb 2012 3 formulation of management models for groundwater remediation let us assume that the mass of contaminant in an aquifer before and after pumping are m 0 and m r respectively we can express the contaminant mass that is extracted from the aquifer as 25 m e m 0 m r mathematically m 0 and m r can be expressed as majumder and lu 2021 26a m 0 i 1 n g η δ x i δ y i ϕ i 0 c i 0 26b m r i 1 n g η δ x i δ y i ϕ i c i where n g is the total number of spatial grids in the numerical model approximating the aquifer domain η is the aquifer porosity δx i δy i is the area of the rectangular grid i l2 ϕ i0 is the saturated thickness at grid i prior to pumping l c i0 is the concentration of a contaminant at grid i prior to pumping ml 3 ϕ i is the saturated thickness at grid i after pumping l c i is the concentration of a contaminant at grid i after pumping following previous research the objective function for finding optimal pumping locations can be expressed in the following form majumder and lu 2021 27 min of 0 m r m 0 100 the objective function minimizes the quantity of the contaminant in the aquifer domain with a priori defined pumping strategy for finding optimal pumping locations detailed descriptions of the objective function and associated constraints can be found in previous research majumder and lu 2021 the optimal pumping locations obtained by eq 27 are directly used as input in the multi objective optimization problem eq 28 the first objective is to minimize water extraction rates and the second objective is to minimize the percentage of contaminant mass in the aquifer 28a minimize of 1 t 1 t i 1 d q i t 28b minimize of 2 m r m 0 100 28c q i min q i t q i max 28d d i t d max i 1 2 3 d 28e c i t c max i 1 2 3 d where t is the total stress periods q i t represent extraction rate from the ith well in the stress period t q i min and q i max are the upper and lower bounds of pumping rates for the ith well d i t is the hydraulic drawdown in the location of ith extraction well c it is the concentration of contaminant in the location of ith extraction well d max is the maximum permissible hydraulic drawdown c max is the permissible limit of concentration of contaminant and f c is a constant factor which gives similar weightage to both objective function 4 model development in the two step method the first step is to identify the optimal locations for pumping with a priori defined extraction rate by minimizing the quantity of contaminant mass in the aquifer domain the optimal locations of extraction wells found in the first step are directly used in the second step for multi objective groundwater remediation here a proxy simulator is developed by approximating the simulation models using the ervfl network the proxy simulator is integrated with the multi objective version of empa to generate pareto optimal solutions for groundwater remediation the following are the steps i in the simulation model select the optimal locations of extraction wells as obtained in the 1st step ii repetitively execute the simulation model to generate the input output datasets to train evrvl based proxy model the input dataset is the extraction rate q lb ub within predefined upper and lower bounds the output dataset is the corresponding drawdown d the percent of contaminant mass in the aquifer with respect to initial contaminant mass m r m 0 and the contaminant concentration c iii with the input output datasets train and validate an ervfl network iv develop an so model by integrating the ervfl with empa v use the so model to minimize eq 28 and obtain the pareto optimal front representing the relationship between extraction rates of pumping wells and the percent of remaining contaminant mass in the aquifer 5 numerical experiments we here evaluate the performances of empa and mo empa for single objective and multi objective optimization respectively the other metaheuristics considered for single objective optimization are grey wolf optimizer gwo marine predator algorithm mpa particle swarm optimization pso differential evolution de and cat swarm optimization cso in the past these metaheuristics were used for various groundwater management and remediation studies the default parameter values of different metaheuristics are given in table s1 supplementary six composite test functions are considered here for checking the performances of the metaheuristics the results of composite test functions are given in table s2 supplementary results show that the performance of empa is better than the other metaheuristics the optimal parameter values of the metaheuristics obtained by parameter turning sensitivity analysis are given in table s3 supplementary we further compared the performances of mo empa with three multi objective metaheuristics nsga ii mo cma es and mo scem nine test problems are considered from the literature for performance evaluation of the multi objective metaheuristics deb 2012 zhang et al 2009 the test problems are zdt1 convex zdt2 convex zdt3 discontinuous uf 1 convex uf 4 non convex uf 5 discontinuous uf 6 discontinuous uf 9 multimodal and uf 10 multimodal the zdt test problems are relatively easier to solve however the uf test functions are very difficult problems in multi objective optimization research the default parameter settings of mo empa nsga ii mo cma es and mo scem are given in table s4 based on the population size the mo cma es and mo scem can automatically compute the required parameters during the optimization process igel et al 2007 janža 2022 naeini et al 2019 voß et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 however for mo empa and nsga ii rigorous parameter tunings are often required to get the best results the optimal parameter settings of various metaheuristics obtained by sensitivity analysis are given in table s5 the pareto optimal fronts obtained by mo empa are shown in fig 3 following got et al 2020 two performance metrics namely inverted generational distance igd and spacing sp are considered here for comparing the optimal solutions of multi objective metaheuristics the igd quantitatively measures the convergence of the approximate pareto optimal front with respect to the true pareto optimal front on the contrary the sp is used to quantitatively measure the diversity of the non dominated solutions in the approximate pareto optimal front usually the smaller value of igd and sp indicates better convergence and better diversity of the pareto optimal solution all multi objective metaheuristics are evaluated twenty times for each test function to generate different realizations of pareto optimal solutions using the pareto optimal solutions and true pareto front the igd and sp values are further computed the statistical results in the form of box plots for both igd and sp metrics are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively in terms of the median igd value mo empa is best for test functions zdt1 zdt2 uf1 uf5 and uf6 the solutions of mo empa are best for test functions zdt1 zdt2 uf1 uf5 and uf9 based on the median sp value hence the results indicate the superiority of mo empa over other metaheuristics for most of the selected test functions 6 case study 6 1 model domain and problem statement this study considers a hypothetical unconfined aquifer whose domain and boundary conditions are identical to the east texas study area aquaveo 2018 the aquifer domain and boundary conditions are given in fig 6a a no flow boundary ab bound the aquifer from the north two specified head boundaries ac and bc bound the aquifer from the other directions the hydraulic head decreases linearly from 220 m to 206 m along the specified head boundary ac along the boundary bc the hydraulic head decreases linearly from 218 m to 206 m the hydraulic conductivity field of the aquifer is generated using the truncated normal distribution within the range 5 21 m day the mean and variance of the hydraulic conductivity field are 12 98 m day and 5 58 m day respectively details of other aquifer parameters can be found in majumder and lu 2021 here we create a hypothetical scenario of groundwater contamination from five injection wells fig 6a the injection wells inject contaminated water continuously into the aquifer at a rate of 75 m3 day for five years also the concentration of contaminant in the injected water is 75 000 μg l all the contaminant sources are removed from the aquifer after five years of contamination it is assumed that the transport of the contaminant is taking place only due to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion the sorption or other type of chemical reactions are not considered here for contaminant transport simulation fig 6a also shows a recharge zone area 720 231 76 m2 artificially created to dispose of the extracted contaminated water during remediation fig 6a in this study simulation models depicting the flow and transport processes in the aquifer are developed using modflow and mt3dms fig 6b shows the concentration distribution due to five years of contamination here the objective is to design strategies for groundwater remediation in the next ten years using simulation optimization models the following subsection discusses the application of the simulation optimization models based on a two step method for multi objective groundwater remediation 6 2 determination of optimal locations of pumping wells for groundwater remediation in modflow the locations of pumping wells are denoted by an integer making it a combinatorial optimization problem here two hundred thirty one grid points are identified as the candidate locations for pumping fig 6b the candidate locations are selected so that they cover the whole contaminated region of the aquifer domain fig 6b in this study the total number of pumping wells required for designing groundwater remediation systems is arbitrarily assumed as fifteen we also need to specify the pumping rate which is the same for all fifteen pumping wells for this problem the pumping rate is assumed as 70 m3 day considering the above assumptions we aim to identify fifteen pumping well locations out of 231 by minimizing eq 27 due to such a massive number of possible combinations 231 c 15 the simulation model cannot be trained accurately with the limited input and output datasets majumder and lu 2021 hence the simulation model is directly integrated with the single objective version of empa for finding optimal locations of pumping wells the simulation model is also integrated with other metaheuristics for comparative analysis we executed the empa and other metaheuristics ten times to generate datasets for statistical comparison optimal parameter values of the metaheuristics are shown in table s6 the best optimal pumping locations identified by empa and other optimization algorithms are given in fig 7 fitness values corresponding to the best optimal pumping locations are also listed in table 1 results show that the performance of empa is superior to the rest of the metaheuristics in obtaining optimal locations of extraction wells we further used violin plots to check the performances of the metaheuristics a violin plot is very similar to a box plot except it also shows the probability distribution of numeric data in a violin plot the box and marker represent the interquartile range and median of the dataset the whiskers represent the extreme values of the dataset excluding outliers the probability distribution plot also helps to assess whether the numeric dataset is sparse or multimodal the violin plots obtained by empa and other metaheuristics are shown in fig 8 as shown in the figure the maiden value is the least minimum for empa and maximum for pso the finding suggests the superior capability of empa in obtaining the median average fitness value compared to other metaheuristics the pso is more prone to get entrapped in the local minima which is the reason for its poor performance we also performed the dunn and sidák s test to compare the metaheuristics results statistically fig 9a the horizontal lines in the figure show the range of the data the marker in each line shows the mean value two datasets will be significantly different if the lines representing the datasets are disjoint the figure shows that the solution computed by empa is significantly different and better than the other metaheuristics furthermore the convergence behaviors of the three best algorithms gwo mpa and empa are shown in fig 9b in the first step of the two step approach discussed above the pumping rate was assumed as 70 m3 day here we conducted a rigorous study to assess the effect of the different pumping rates on the performance of the first step of the two step approach for analysis three different pumping rates are considered here 5 m3 day 10 m3 day and 70 m3 day the different pumping rates are used to generate three realizations of optimal pumping locations using the first step of the two step approach fig s1 the results indicate no significant difference among the three realizations of optimal pumping locations table s8 a detailed discussion of the analysis can be found in the supplementary hence the pumping rate can be any value within its range excluding very low and very high pumping rates a very high pumping rate may cause dry cell problems in the modflow simulation and a very low pumping rate may not be able to initiate the movement of contaminants toward the direction of pumping wells we propose to select a pumping rate in such a way that it can extract a considerable amount of contaminant mass from the aquifer for this study the pumping rate of 70 m3 day is an appropriate choice as it can remove more than 80 of the contaminant mass from the aquifer 6 3 ervfl network to approximate the flow and transport models here the aim is to approximate the flow and transport models using the ervfl network the input dataset is the pumping rates which vary in the range 300 0 m3 day and the output datasets are the drawdown the concentration of the contaminant and the quantity of the contaminant mass removed by pumping the optimal pumping locations identified by the first step are directly used as input in the flow and transport models the input output datasets for training the ervfl network are generated by repetitively executing the flow and transport models by 20 000 times the number of hidden neurons in the ervfl network is assumed as 1000 regularization parameters c r are computed by cross validation deng et al 2009 majumder and lu 2021 scardapane et al 2015 after training the accuracy of the ervfl network is further tested using the correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse in fig 10 a b c the coefficient of correlations in estimating hydraulic drawdown the concentration of contaminant and the percentage of the extracted mass of contaminant using ervfl are found to be 0 99 0 989 and 0 99 respectively also the rmse values are small positive numbers for all three cases fig 10 a b c the results indicate a very good generalization ability of the ervfl model to train the simulation model in this study we also want to evaluate the performance of the ervfl network with the original rvfl for training datasets that are noisy or corrupted with outliers however the training datasets in the above analysis have no outliers noises hence we artificially added five hundred noisy data to the training datasets fig 10 d shows very poor performance r 0 871 and rmse 782 39 of the original rvfl while computing the contaminant concentration in comparison the performance of ervfl is better than the original rvfl in approximating dataset having noises r 0 95 and rmse 114 76 fig 10 e one may also encounter noises in the datasets for real field groundwater modeling for example the training datasets generated by the groundwater flow model may be combined with actual field data observed hydraulic head values leading to noise outliers in the dataset the ervfl network may be used for such real field groundwater studies in the future 6 4 multi objective optimization the proxy model based on ervfl is integrated with mo empa to find the pareto front of two conflicting objectives minimization of the total pumping rate and the minimization of the contaminant mass percentage in the aquifer decision variables are the pumping rates that vary across the fifteen pumping locations the constraints eq 28d eq 28e are also relaxed to generate the whole pareto front four metaheuristics are considered here mo empa nsga ii mo cma es and mo scem the pareto fronts are obtained for various generations iterations shown in fig 11 figure indicates that the mo empa generates the whole pareto front with fewer generations than nsga ii and mo cma es the non dominated pareto optimal solutions of various metaheuristics are also statistically compared with respect to two performance metrics spacing sp and inverted generational distance igd each metaheuristic is executed ten times to generate different realizations of pareto optimal solutions for computing performance metrics the true pareto front is also required all the pareto optimal solutions obtained by different metaheuristics are collected and combined to generate the true pareto front previous studies also reported a similar mechanism to generate a true pareto front guo et al 2013 usually a smaller igd and sp indicate better convergence and diversity of the pareto optimal solutions in fig 12 the values of igd and sp are the minimum for mo empa among all the metaheuristics hence mo empa is superior to other metaheuristics in obtaining the pareto optimal solutions for the groundwater remediation problem the pareto front discussed above can be used to generate different scenarios for groundwater remediation each point in the pareto front is a solution to the optimization problem here two points a and b are selected in the pareto front obtained by mo empa fig 11 m the objective function values and pumping rates corresponding to points a and b are listed in table 2 fig 13 also shows the locations of the pumping wells found using empa in the first step of the two step method we here compare the efficacy of the two step method for multi objective groundwater remediation with respect to a traditional technique where pumping wells are placed along the contaminant plume centreline the details of the traditional method for groundwater remediation can be found in previous research erickson et al 2002 jiang and na 2020 yang et al 2013 fig 10f also shows the pumping well locations selected manually along the contaminant plume centreline by the traditional approach fig 14 compares the non dominated solutions obtained by the traditional and two step methods here we consider four scenarios by varying the range of decision variables pumping rates a 55 q 45 b 60 q 30 c 80 q 20 d 300 q 0 the figure shows that the percent of contaminant mass in the aquifer using the two step approach is far less than the traditional one for the same pumping rate the difference in the percent of contaminant mass for the same pumping rates is almost 15 for cases a and b further comparing the four scenarios we also observed that the difference between the two pareto optimal fronts is less prominent when the ranges of decision variables pumping rates are more by increasing the range of pumping rates we give it more weightage in the optimization model than the pumping locations this is the main reason for such behavior of the pareto front 7 sensitivity analysis of the multi objective optimization algorithms the performance of optimization algorithms highly depends on various control parameters generally the optimal values of the control parameters of an optimization algorithm can be obtained using rigorous sensitivity analysis however sensitivity analyses of the control parameters are often not required for mo cma es and mo scem both algorithms can automatically find the optimal values of the control parameters based on the population size and dimensions of the optimization problem table s4 the optimal values of the various control parameters of mo empa and nsga ii must be found using sensitivity analyses this section evaluates the sensitivities for various control parameters of mo empa and nsga ii for the groundwater remediation problem 7 1 sensitivity analysis of mo empa the parameters considered for sensitivity analysis of mo empa are the population size n distribution factor p f fish aggregating device fad mutation scaling factor m crossover operator cr and number of divisions of the adaptive grid n grid the ranges of various parameters and their default values are shown in table s4 a candidate parameter is varied within its range by keeping the other parameters to their default values for generating non dominated solutions the mo empa is executed ten times for each realization of a candidate parameter and the respective igd and sp values are computed from the non dominated solutions further the average values of igd and sp are calculated for statistical comparisons it should be noted that the least values of igd and sp indicate better solutions 7 1 1 population size n the figure shows that the igd and sp values keep decreasing with an increase in the population size n fig 15a and fig 15b however there are no significant changes in igd and sp values for a population above 100 hence an appropriate choice of population size for the problem is 100 7 1 2 distribution factor p f the values of igd and sp are minimum for the distribution factor having values of 0 6 and 0 4 respectively fig 15c and fig 15d by averaging we can choose the value of the distribution factors as 0 5 for the problem previous research also found the appropriate value of the distribution factors as 0 5 for finding minimum values of several benchmark functions 7 1 3 fish aggregating device fad in fig 15e and fig 15f the minimum values of igd and sp are obtained for fad having values of 0 3 and 0 2 respectively by averaging the fad can be set to 0 25 for the problem 7 1 4 mutation scaling factor m as shown in the figure the values of igd and sp are minimum for the mutation scaling factor of 0 045 and 0 05 respectively fig 15g and fig 15h we may select a value close to 0 0475 for the mutation scaling factor by taking an average 7 1 5 crossover operator cr in fig 15i and fig 15j the minimum values of igd and sp are obtained for crossover operators of 0 7 and 0 8 respectively hence it is appropriate to set the value of cr to 0 75 7 1 6 number of divisions of the adaptive grid n grid as shown in fig 15k there is no significant improvement in the igd for n grid greater than 30 there is also no substantial improvement in the sp for the n grid greater than 20 fig 15l hence we can select n grid close to 25 for the problem considering the above analysis the optimal control parameters of mo empa for groundwater remediation problem is n 100 p f 0 5 fad 0 25 m 0 0475 cr 0 75 n grid 25 7 2 sensitivity analysis of nsga ii this section evaluates the sensitivities of the various control parameters of nsga ii for groundwater remediation the parameters of nsga ii are the population size n crossover operator cr and mutation scaling factor m the default values of the parameters and ranges are shown in table s4 7 2 1 population size n as shown in fig 16 a b the igd and sp decrease with increasing population size n however there are no significant changes in the igd and sp for population size n above 100 hence the population size n of 100 is appropriate for the problem 7 2 2 mutation scaling factor m in fig 16 c d the igd and sp are minimum when the values of the mutation scaling factor m are 0 045 and 0 05 respectively averaging both the values the mutation scaling factor can be set to 0 0775 7 2 3 crossover operator cr in fig 16 e f the values of igd and sp are minimum for the crossover operator cr 0 8 and 0 85 respectively averaging both the values the crossover operator cr can be set to 0 825 for this problem considering the above analysis the optimal control parameters of mo empa for groundwater remediation problem is n 100 m 0 0475 cr 0 825 8 discussion the present study evaluated the effectiveness of the two step approach for multi objective groundwater remediation for the first time it should be noted that this study is significantly different from a previous study where the two step method was used for single objective groundwater remediation this study found that the two step approach is more accurate than a traditional method for the multi objective groundwater remediation design of a hypothetical unconfined aquifer in this study we also modified the random vector functional link rvfl and the marine predator algorithm mpa before applying them for groundwater remediation the methodological improvements of both algorithms are also novelties of the present study moreover the use of both algorithms for groundwater remediation is the first ever application in the field of groundwater studies it is worth mentioning that the extreme learning machine elm which is architecturally quite identical to the rvfl has already been used for groundwater remediation the main difference between rvfl and elm is that the elm does not use direct links between the input and output layers to avoid overfitting issues the present study has several limitations that should be considered to apply the two step method for real field groundwater remediation this study deliberately disregarded the uncertainties in aquifer parameters and contaminant source characterization for groundwater remediation design however these uncertainties cannot be discarded for a real field groundwater remediation design this study also assumes a static pumping policy with a single operation period in which the pumping rate of an individual pumping well remains unaltered generally a dynamic pumping policy with multiple operation periods is often more appropriate for real field groundwater remediation design a two step approach involving uncertainties in aquifer parameters contaminant sources characterization and dynamic pumping policy will be an exciting area for future research on multi objective groundwater remediation this study also found that the performances of the first step of the two step approach in obtaining optimal pumping locations do not depend significantly on the predefined pumping rate for this study the predefined pumping rate can be any value within its range excluding very high and very low pumping rates however the predefined pumping rate may impact the performance of the first step of the two step approach for more complex aquifer systems involving uncertainties in aquifer parameters and dynamic pumping policy for future applications the researcher should independently check for any possible relationship between predefined pumping rates and optimal pumping locations we recommend selecting a pumping rate capable of extracting a significant percentage of total contaminant mass from the aquifer 9 conclusion this study proposes so models based on a two step method for groundwater remediation using enhanced random vector functional link ervfl and evolutionary marine predator algorithm empa the ervfl is used as a proxy simulator of the flow and transport models enhancing computational performance in this study the weighted least square method is used to improve the generalization ability of the ervfl network where weights are computed using the kernel density estimator kde the empa is developed by modifying mpa with elimination mechanisms evolution operators and elite opposition based learning in the multi objective version of empa an archive controller and adaptive grid mechanism are used to store pareto optimal solutions in an external repository the so models are applied to a hypothetical unconfined aquifer in the first step the empa is directly integrated with the flow and transport models and used to obtain the optimal locations of extraction wells by minimizing the contaminant mass percentage in the aquifer the results violin plots and dunn and sidák s test showed the superior performance of empa over other metaheuristics in obtaining optimal locations of extraction wells in the second step the ervfl based proxy model which approximates the flow and transport models is integrated with mo empa to design multi objective groundwater remediation strategies the second step utilizes the optimal locations of extraction wells computed in the first step as input the pareto optimal solutions trade off between optimal total pumping rates and contaminant mass percentage in the aquifer obtained using the mo empa are compared with nsga ii mo cma es and mo scem from the results mo empa is better than other metaheuristics for multi objective groundwater remediation the two step approach is also compared to a traditional method of manually fixing pumping locations along the plume centreline results

1204,we here propose a two step approach based simulation optimization model for multi objective groundwater remediation using enhanced random vector functional link ervfl and evolutionary marine predator algorithm empa in this study groundwater flow and solute transport models are developed using modflow and mt3dms the ervfl network is used to approximate the flow and transport models enhancing the computational performance this study also improves the robustness of the ervfl network using a kernel density estimator kde based weighted least square approach we further develop the empa by modifying the marine predator algorithm mpa using elite opposition based learning biological evolution operators and elimination mechanisms in the multi objective version of empa the non dominated pareto optimal solutions are stored in an external repository using an archive controller and adaptive grid mechanism to promote better convergence and diversity of the pareto front the proposed methodologies are applied for multi objective groundwater remediation of a hypothetical unconfined aquifer based on the two step method the first step directly integrates flow and transport models with empa and finds the optimal locations of pumping wells by minimizing the percent of contaminant mass remaining in the aquifer in the second step the ervl based proxy model is integrated with empa and used for multi objective optimization while explicitly using the pumping well locations obtained in the first step the multi objective optimization generates a pareto optimal solution representing the relationship between the rate of pumping and the amount of contaminant mass in the aquifer further analyses show a significant advantage of the two step approach over a traditional method for multi objective groundwater remediation keywords groundwater remediation multi objective optimization enhanced random vector functional link ervfl evolutionary marine predator algorithm empa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the pump and treat pat is a physical method of extracting contaminated groundwater to the earth s surface and treating the water with a filtering system to remove harmful contaminants in the last several decades the simulation optimization so models have been extensively used for designing pat based systems to remediate groundwater bear and sun 1998 erickson et al 2002 guan and aral 1999 majumder and lu 2021 mckinney and lin 1994 pang and shoemaker 2023 seyedpour 2019 yang et al 2022 2013 simulation models are generally developed by using the finite difference method fdm or finite element method fem to solve flow and transport equations fitts 2002 in an so model the simulation model is executed by the optimization model repeatedly many thousands of times to find optimal values of the control parameters i e pumping locations extraction rates injection rates of the pat system jiang and na 2020 majumder and eldho 2020 majumder and lu 2021 mckinney and lin 1996 1994 however the repeated execution of a computationally expensive simulation model in the so approach often leads to enormous computational costs majumder and lu 2021 zhao et al 2020 therefore many prior studies constructed a data driven surrogate proxy simulator of a computationally costly simulation model to enhance computational performance jiang and na 2020 the most common surrogates applied in the field of groundwater studies are polynomial regression he et al 2008 huang et al 2003 qin et al 2007 kriging hemker et al 2008 zhang et al 2022 artificial neural network majumder and eldho 2020 qaderi and babanezhad 2017 rogers and dowla 1994 yan and minsker 2006 support vector machine ch et al 2013 and extreme learning machine jiang et al 2015 majumder and lu 2021 yadav et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 in the kriging surrogate the solution may get stuck in the local optima when the values of the distance constraints are small zhao et al 2020 for the support vector machine the accuracy of the solutions largely depends on the selection of an appropriate kernel function and several other hyperparameters raghavendra and deka 2014 however finding the values of hyperparameters for the support vector machine is a trial and error process that is often time consuming raghavendra and deka 2014 a recent study on groundwater remediation also claimed that the generalization ability of elm is better than svm in approximating flow and transport models yadav et al 2016 furthermore elm is computationally more efficient than the support vector machine and artificial neural network yadav et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 alternatively the random vector functional link rvfl network can be used as a proxy simulator due to its universal approximation ability of any continuous function with compact input output datasets and high computational performance elaziz et al 2020 scardapane et al 2015 zhang and suganthan 2016 the network structure of rvfl is quite similar to the extreme learning machine elm and single layer ffnn except for a direct link between the input layer and the output layer pao et al 1994 such direct links between the input and output layers are standard practice in neural networks to avoid over fitting issues during the training phase pao et al 1994 in rvfl the hidden layer thresholds and input weights are randomly sampled from a uniform distribution and the output weights are computed by minimizing a loss function using moore penrose pseudo inverse or ridge regression zhang and suganthan 2016 the rvfl network shows better generalization ability and superior computational efficiency than the svm and single layer ffnn zhang and suganthan 2016 nevertheless the training dataset with outliers may reduce the generalization ability of the rvfl network this issue can be resolved by incorporating the weighted least square wls approach in the rvfl network where weights can be computed using the kernel density estimator kde dai et al 2015 some of the popular single objective optimization methods for groundwater management and remediation are cat swarm

field groundwater remediation the decision makers may encounter multiple conflicting objectives such as minimizing cleanup time minimizing health risks minimizing the cost of remediation minimizing pumping rates minimizing the quantity of contaminant in the aquifer and maximizing reliability erickson et al 2002 majumder and lu 2021 yang et al 2013 in the traditional groundwater remediation approach multiple objectives are lumped together with user defined weights to form a single objective optimization problem erickson et al 2002 yang et al 2017 another standard method of dealing with multiple objectives is to minimize maximize one of the objectives while keeping other objectives as constraints erickson et al 2002 yang et al 2017 however a multi objective optimization problem with such over simplification only generates a single optimal solution instead of the trade off non dominated solutions between conflicting objectives erickson et al 2002 alternatively multi objective metaheuristics can be used for groundwater remediation to generate pareto optimal solutions for several conflicting objectives some of the most common multi objective metaheuristics for groundwater resources management and remediation are the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii kollat and reed 2006 mondal et al 2010 rezaei et al 2020 niched pareto tabu search npts yang et al 2017

a modified nsga ii over moea for groundwater monitoring design recently a metaheuristic namely the marine predator algorithm mpa has been developed by emulating the cooperative hunting strategy of marine predators to capture prey faramarzi et al 2020 several unimodal multimodal and composite test functions were considered to evaluate the performances of mpa faramarzi et al 2020 liang et al 2005 for the selected test functions the performances of mpa were superior to various metaheuristics ga de sa and pso in terms of exploration and exploitation abilities faramarzi et al 2020 since its invention mpa has been getting much attention in many fields such as structural engineering electrical and power engineering and energy elaziz et al 2020 ridha 2020 sun et al 2020 the performance of mpa can be further improved by various strategies such as incorporating elite opposition based learning using biological evolution operators and applying elimination mechanisms majumder and lu 2021 wang and li 2019 determining the optimal pumping locations is crucial in designing an effective pat based groundwater remediation system huang and mayer 1997 wang and ahlfeld 1994 in many studies a fixed number of pumping wells are guessed along the centreline of the plume for groundwater remediation erickson et al 2002 jiang and na 2020 luo et al 2014 yang et al 2022 2017 2013 however determining optimal pumping location is not straightforward for highly heterogeneous aquifers guan and aral 1999 huang and mayer 1997 wang and ahlfeld 1994 many studies on groundwater remediation also considered the pumping well locations as decision variables in the optimization model bayer and finkel 2007 2004 guan and aral 1999 huang and mayer 1997 verardo et al 2021 wang and ahlfeld 1994 wang and ahlfeld 1994 and huang and mayer 1997 used a moving well approach where the pumping locations and pumping rates were explicitly considered as the decision variables in the optimization model wang and ahlfeld 1994 identified optimal pumping location by moving each pumping well within the aquifer domain as a continuous function of space as the pumping well moves in the aquifer domain the pumping rate is distributed as a continuous function of the spatial domain using hermite interpolation functions wang and ahlfeld 1994 rizzo and dougherty 1996 used a combinatorial optimization method to find optimal pumping locations from a large number of discrete candidate pumping locations in the aquifer domain recently a two step method was proposed for the remediation of contaminated groundwater that segregates a single objective optimization problem into two management models majumder and lu 2021 in the first management model a combinatorial optimization method is used to find optimal locations by minimizing the quantity of pollutant mass in the aquifer domain the first management model used a predefined pumping rate 150 m3 day which is the same for all pumping wells the optimal pumping locations found in the first step were used explicitly in the second step for finding optimal extraction rates for the remediation of groundwater majumder and lu 2021 also found that the two step approach is computationally very efficient and highly accurate for single objective groundwater remediation however the effectiveness of the two step method was not evaluated for multi objective groundwater remediation motivated by this the present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the two step method for multi objective groundwater remediation this study also methodologically modified the random vector functional link rvfl and marine predator algorithm mpa which is in an attempt to develop a better so model for the remediation of groundwater both the rvfl and mpa have never been used in the past for groundwater remediation in this study the modified algorithms are named as the enhanced random vector functional link ervfl and evolutionary marine predator algorithm empa the ervfl network uses the weighted least squares wls method based on the kernel density estimator to improve the algorithm s robustness the empa is the modified version of mpa with elite opposition based learning biological evolution operator and elimination mechanism in the multi objective version of empa the non dominated solutions are stored in a repository using the archive controller and adaptive grid mechanism the proposed methodologies are applied for multi objective groundwater remediation using the two step method 2 methodology this study uses the modflow and mt3dms codes for solving the subsurface flow and transport equations harbaugh and arlen 2005 zheng and wang 1999 further a proxy model based on the ervfl network is developed for approximating flow and transport models this study also proposes empa for designing groundwater remediation strategies the detailed methodologies of ervfl and empa are discussed below 2 1 random vector functional link rvfl the rvfl is a feed forward network having a single hidden layer connecting the input and output layers fig 1 additionally the output layer and input layer are also directly connected to help avoid overfitting issues and improve performance during the training phase pao et al 1994 vuković et al 2018 let us consider a distinct input output dataset of dimensions n d and can be represented as eq 1

lévy movements faramarzi et al 2020 using the velocity ratios between predator and prey the search processes of the mpa are divided into three phases elaziz et al 2020 2 3 1 exploration phase in the

marine predators faramarzi et al 2020 in a previous study it was reported that 80 of the time sharks spend in the surrounding area of fads and the rest of the time sharks make many long jumps in various directions to search for prey such behavior of sharks can be incorporated into the mpa algorithm to avoid entrapment in the local minima by considering eddy formation and fad the positions of a candidate marine predator are updated as faramarzi et al 2020 18a x i t 1 x i t c f x min r x max x min w if r f a d 18b x i t 1 x i t f ad 1 r r x r 1 x r 2 if r f a d where x min and x max are

if no other solution in the search space dominates it mirjalili et al 2016 22 y r d y x 2 4 3 pareto optimal set the pareto optimal set represents the collections of all pareto optimal solutions mirjalili et al 2016 23 p s x r d y r d y x 2 4 4 pareto optimal front the pareto optimal front is the projection of the non dominated solutions in the objective functions space mirjalili et al 2016 24 p f f x x p s 2 4 5 external repository this study used an external repository archive for storing pareto optimal solutions using an archive controller and adaptive grid mechanism coello et al 2004 mirjalili et al 2016 2 4 6 archive controller the archive controller controls the entry of non dominated solutions into the repository during the iteration process based on several conditions mirjalili et al 2016 a pictorial representation of several conditions of the archive controller is shown in fig 2 let us consider a non dominated solution n s willing to enter into the repository case 1 add n s into the external repository if the archive is empty case 2 if n s is dominated by one or more members in the external repository then discard n s case 3 if n s is not dominated by any member in the external repository then directly add it to the repository case 4 if one or more members in the external repository are dominated by n s then remove the dominated members and add n s to the repository 2 4 7 adaptive grid mechanism the purpose of the adaptive grid mechanism is to maintain diversity among non dominated solutions mirjalili et al 2016 case 5 if n s fulfill the criterion neither n s nor any individual in the repository dominates each other to enter into the external repository but the repository is full then invoke the adaptive grid mechanism to make space for the n s remove an individual from the most crowded repository segment using the roulette wheel selection method if n s lies outside the current bound of the grid then recalculate the grid and relocate each individual of the grid repository to accommodate n s removing individuals from the most crowded space of the repository helps improve the diversity of the pareto optimal solutions various parameters are used to implement the adaptive grid mechanism such as the grid inflation parameter α 0 1 the number of grids per each dimension n grid 20 the best individual selection pressure parameter β 4 and the repository individual selection parameter γ 2 liu et al 2020 2 4 8 selection of best individual the best individual selection mechanism chooses the least crowded segment of the search space using the roulette wheel selection method to emphasize better exploration mirjalili et al 2016 2 4 9 performance metrics in multi objective optimization performance metrics such as inverted generational distance igd spacing sp and maximum spread ms are used to check the convergence and diversity of the non dominated solutions with respect to the true pareto optimal solutions deb 2012 3 formulation of management models for groundwater remediation let us assume that the mass of contaminant in an aquifer before and after pumping are m 0 and m r respectively we can express the contaminant mass that is extracted from the aquifer as 25 m e m 0 m r mathematically m 0 and m r can be expressed as majumder and lu 2021 26a m 0 i 1 n g η δ x i δ y i ϕ i 0 c i 0 26b m r i 1 n g η δ x i δ y i ϕ i c i where n g is the total number of spatial grids in the numerical model approximating the aquifer domain η is the aquifer porosity δx i δy i is the area of the rectangular grid i l2 ϕ i0 is the saturated thickness at grid i prior to pumping l c i0 is the concentration of a contaminant at grid i prior to pumping ml 3 ϕ i is the saturated thickness at grid i after pumping l c i is the concentration of a contaminant at grid i after pumping following previous research the objective function for finding optimal pumping locations can be expressed in the following form majumder and lu 2021 27 min of 0 m r m 0 100 the objective function minimizes the quantity of the contaminant in the aquifer domain with a priori defined pumping strategy for finding optimal pumping locations detailed descriptions of the objective function and associated constraints can be found in previous research majumder and lu 2021 the optimal pumping locations obtained by eq 27 are directly used as input in the multi objective optimization problem eq 28 the first objective is to minimize water extraction rates and the second objective is to minimize the percentage of contaminant mass in the aquifer 28a minimize of 1 t 1 t i 1 d q i t 28b minimize of 2 m r m 0 100 28c q i min q i t q i max 28d d i t d max i 1 2 3 d 28e c i t c max i 1 2 3 d where t is the total stress periods q i t represent extraction rate from the ith well in the stress period t q i min and q i max are the upper and lower bounds of pumping rates for the ith well d i t is the hydraulic drawdown in the location of ith extraction well c it is the concentration of contaminant in the location of ith extraction well d max is the maximum permissible hydraulic drawdown c max is the permissible limit of concentration of contaminant and f c is a constant factor which gives similar weightage to both objective function 4 model development in the two step method the first step is to identify the optimal locations for pumping with a priori defined extraction rate by minimizing the quantity of contaminant mass in the aquifer domain the optimal locations of extraction wells found in the first step are directly used in the second step for multi objective groundwater remediation here a proxy simulator is developed by approximating the simulation models using the ervfl network the proxy simulator is integrated with the multi objective version of empa to generate pareto optimal solutions for groundwater remediation the following are the steps i in the simulation model select the optimal locations of extraction wells as obtained in the 1st step ii repetitively execute the simulation model to generate the input output datasets to train evrvl based proxy model the input dataset is the extraction rate q lb ub within predefined upper and lower bounds the output dataset is the corresponding drawdown d the percent of contaminant mass in the aquifer with respect to initial contaminant mass m r m 0 and the contaminant concentration c iii with the input output datasets train and validate an ervfl network iv develop an so model by integrating the ervfl with empa v use the so model to minimize eq 28 and obtain the pareto optimal front representing the relationship between extraction rates of pumping wells and the percent of remaining contaminant mass in the aquifer 5 numerical experiments we here evaluate the performances of empa and mo empa for single objective and multi objective optimization respectively the other metaheuristics considered for single objective optimization are grey wolf optimizer gwo marine predator algorithm mpa particle swarm optimization pso differential evolution de and cat swarm optimization cso in the past these metaheuristics were used for various groundwater management and remediation studies the default parameter values of different metaheuristics are given in table s1 supplementary six composite test functions are considered here for checking the performances of the metaheuristics the results of composite test functions are given in table s2 supplementary results show that the performance of empa is better than the other metaheuristics the optimal parameter values of the metaheuristics obtained by parameter turning sensitivity analysis are given in table s3 supplementary we further compared the performances of mo empa with three multi objective metaheuristics nsga ii mo cma es and mo scem nine test problems are considered from the literature for performance evaluation of the multi objective metaheuristics deb 2012 zhang et al 2009 the test problems are zdt1 convex zdt2 convex zdt3 discontinuous uf 1 convex uf 4 non convex uf 5 discontinuous uf 6 discontinuous uf 9 multimodal and uf 10 multimodal the zdt test problems are relatively easier to solve however the uf test functions are very difficult problems in multi objective optimization research the default parameter settings of mo empa nsga ii mo cma es and mo scem are given in table s4 based on the population size the mo cma es and mo scem can automatically compute the required parameters during the optimization process igel et al 2007 janža 2022 naeini et al 2019 voß et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 however for mo empa and nsga ii rigorous parameter tunings are often required to get the best results the optimal parameter settings of various metaheuristics obtained by sensitivity analysis are given in table s5 the pareto optimal fronts obtained by mo empa are shown in fig 3 following got et al 2020 two performance metrics namely inverted generational distance igd and spacing sp are considered here for comparing the optimal solutions of multi objective metaheuristics the igd quantitatively measures the convergence of the approximate pareto optimal front with respect to the true pareto optimal front on the contrary the sp is used to quantitatively measure the diversity of the non dominated solutions in the approximate pareto optimal front usually the smaller value of igd and sp indicates better convergence and better diversity of the pareto optimal solution all multi objective metaheuristics are evaluated twenty times for each test function to generate different realizations of pareto optimal solutions using the pareto optimal solutions and true pareto front the igd and sp values are further computed the statistical results in the form of box plots for both igd and sp metrics are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively in terms of the median igd value mo empa is best for test functions zdt1 zdt2 uf1 uf5 and uf6 the solutions of mo empa are best for test functions zdt1 zdt2 uf1 uf5 and uf9 based on the median sp value hence the results indicate the superiority of mo empa over other metaheuristics for most of the selected test functions 6 case study 6 1 model domain and problem statement this study considers a hypothetical unconfined aquifer whose domain and boundary conditions are identical to the east texas study area aquaveo 2018 the aquifer domain and boundary conditions are given in fig 6a a no flow boundary ab bound the aquifer from the north two specified head boundaries ac and bc bound the aquifer from the other directions the hydraulic head decreases linearly from 220 m to 206 m along the specified head boundary ac along the boundary bc the hydraulic head decreases linearly from 218 m to 206 m the hydraulic conductivity field of the aquifer is generated using the truncated normal distribution within the range 5 21 m day the mean and variance of the hydraulic conductivity field are 12 98 m day and 5 58 m day respectively details of other aquifer parameters can be found in majumder and lu 2021 here we create a hypothetical scenario of groundwater contamination from five injection wells fig 6a the injection wells inject contaminated water continuously into the aquifer at a rate of 75 m3 day for five years also the concentration of contaminant in the injected water is 75 000 μg l all the contaminant sources are removed from the aquifer after five years of contamination it is assumed that the transport of the contaminant is taking place only due to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion the sorption or other type of chemical reactions are not considered here for contaminant transport simulation fig 6a also shows a recharge zone area 720 231 76 m2 artificially created to dispose of the extracted contaminated water during remediation fig 6a in this study simulation models depicting the flow and transport processes in the aquifer are developed using modflow and mt3dms fig 6b shows the concentration distribution due to five years of contamination here the objective is to design strategies for groundwater remediation in the next ten years using simulation optimization models the following subsection discusses the application of the simulation optimization models based on a two step method for multi objective groundwater remediation 6 2 determination of optimal locations of pumping wells for groundwater remediation in modflow the locations of pumping wells are denoted by an integer making it a combinatorial optimization problem here two hundred thirty one grid points are identified as the candidate locations for pumping fig 6b the candidate locations are selected so that they cover the whole contaminated region of the aquifer domain fig 6b in this study the total number of pumping wells required for designing groundwater remediation systems is arbitrarily assumed as fifteen we also need to specify the pumping rate which is the same for all fifteen pumping wells for this problem the pumping rate is assumed as 70 m3 day considering the above assumptions we aim to identify fifteen pumping well locations out of 231 by minimizing eq 27 due to such a massive number of possible combinations 231 c 15 the simulation model cannot be trained accurately with the limited input and output datasets majumder and lu 2021 hence the simulation model is directly integrated with the single objective version of empa for finding optimal locations of pumping wells the simulation model is also integrated with other metaheuristics for comparative analysis we executed the empa and other metaheuristics ten times to generate datasets for statistical comparison optimal parameter values of the metaheuristics are shown in table s6 the best optimal pumping locations identified by empa and other optimization algorithms are given in fig 7 fitness values corresponding to the best optimal pumping locations are also listed in table 1 results show that the performance of empa is superior to the rest of the metaheuristics in obtaining optimal locations of extraction wells we further used violin plots to check the performances of the metaheuristics a violin plot is very similar to a box plot except it also shows the probability distribution of numeric data in a violin plot the box and marker represent the interquartile range and median of the dataset the whiskers represent the extreme values of the dataset excluding outliers the probability distribution plot also helps to assess whether the numeric dataset is sparse or multimodal the violin plots obtained by empa and other metaheuristics are shown in fig 8 as shown in the figure the maiden value is the least minimum for empa and maximum for pso the finding suggests the superior capability of empa in obtaining the median average fitness value compared to other metaheuristics the pso is more prone to get entrapped in the local minima which is the reason for its poor performance we also performed the dunn and sidák s test to compare the metaheuristics results statistically fig 9a the horizontal lines in the figure show the range of the data the marker in each line shows the mean value two datasets will be significantly different if the lines representing the datasets are disjoint the figure shows that the solution computed by empa is significantly different and better than the other metaheuristics furthermore the convergence behaviors of the three best algorithms gwo mpa and empa are shown in fig 9b in the first step of the two step approach discussed above the pumping rate was assumed as 70 m3 day here we conducted a rigorous study to assess the effect of the different pumping rates on the performance of the first step of the two step approach for analysis three different pumping rates are considered here 5 m3 day 10 m3 day and 70 m3 day the different pumping rates are used to generate three realizations of optimal pumping locations using the first step of the two step approach fig s1 the results indicate no significant difference among the three realizations of optimal pumping locations table s8 a detailed discussion of the analysis can be found in the supplementary hence the pumping rate can be any value within its range excluding very low and very high pumping rates a very high pumping rate may cause dry cell problems in the modflow simulation and a very low pumping rate may not be able to initiate the movement of contaminants toward the direction of pumping wells we propose to select a pumping rate in such a way that it can extract a considerable amount of contaminant mass from the aquifer for this study the pumping rate of 70 m3 day is an appropriate choice as it can remove more than 80 of the contaminant mass from the aquifer 6 3 ervfl network to approximate the flow and transport models here the aim is to approximate the flow and transport models using the ervfl network the input dataset is the pumping rates which vary in the range 300 0 m3 day and the output datasets are the drawdown the concentration of the contaminant and the quantity of the contaminant mass removed by pumping the optimal pumping locations identified by the first step are directly used as input in the flow and transport models the input output datasets for training the ervfl network are generated by repetitively executing the flow and transport models by 20 000 times the number of hidden neurons in the ervfl network is assumed as 1000 regularization parameters c r are computed by cross validation deng et al 2009 majumder and lu 2021 scardapane et al 2015 after training the accuracy of the ervfl network is further tested using the correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse in fig 10 a b c the coefficient of correlations in estimating hydraulic drawdown the concentration of contaminant and the percentage of the extracted mass of contaminant using ervfl are found to be 0 99 0 989 and 0 99 respectively also the rmse values are small positive numbers for all three cases fig 10 a b c the results indicate a very good generalization ability of the ervfl model to train the simulation model in this study we also want to evaluate the performance of the ervfl network with the original rvfl for training datasets that are noisy or corrupted with outliers however the training datasets in the above analysis have no outliers noises hence we artificially added five hundred noisy data to the training datasets fig 10 d shows very poor performance r 0 871 and rmse 782 39 of the original rvfl while computing the contaminant concentration in comparison the performance of ervfl is better than the original rvfl in approximating dataset having noises r 0 95 and rmse 114 76 fig 10 e one may also encounter noises in the datasets for real field groundwater modeling for example the training datasets generated by the groundwater flow model may be combined with actual field data observed hydraulic head values leading to noise outliers in the dataset the ervfl network may be used for such real field groundwater studies in the future 6 4 multi objective optimization the proxy model based on ervfl is integrated with mo empa to find the pareto front of two conflicting objectives minimization of the total pumping rate and the minimization of the contaminant mass percentage in the aquifer decision variables are the pumping rates that vary across the fifteen pumping locations the constraints eq 28d eq 28e are also relaxed to generate the whole pareto front four metaheuristics are considered here mo empa nsga ii mo cma es and mo scem the pareto fronts are obtained for various generations iterations shown in fig 11 figure indicates that the mo empa generates the whole pareto front with fewer generations than nsga ii and mo cma es the non dominated pareto optimal solutions of various metaheuristics are also statistically compared with respect to two performance metrics spacing sp and inverted generational distance igd each metaheuristic is executed ten times to generate different realizations of pareto optimal solutions for computing performance metrics the true pareto front is also required all the pareto optimal solutions obtained by different metaheuristics are collected and combined to generate the true pareto front previous studies also reported a similar mechanism to generate a true pareto front guo et al 2013 usually a smaller igd and sp indicate better convergence and diversity of the pareto optimal solutions in fig 12 the values of igd and sp are the minimum for mo empa among all the metaheuristics hence mo empa is superior to other metaheuristics in obtaining the pareto optimal solutions for the groundwater remediation problem the pareto front discussed above can be used to generate different scenarios for groundwater remediation each point in the pareto front is a solution to the optimization problem here two points a and b are selected in the pareto front obtained by mo empa fig 11 m the objective function values and pumping rates corresponding to points a and b are listed in table 2 fig 13 also shows the locations of the pumping wells found using empa in the first step of the two step method we here compare the efficacy of the two step method for multi objective groundwater remediation with respect to a traditional technique where pumping wells are placed along the contaminant plume centreline the details of the traditional method for groundwater remediation can be found in previous research erickson et al 2002 jiang and na 2020 yang et al 2013 fig 10f also shows the pumping well locations selected manually along the contaminant plume centreline by the traditional approach fig 14 compares the non dominated solutions obtained by the traditional and two step methods here we consider four scenarios by varying the range of decision variables pumping rates a 55 q 45 b 60 q 30 c 80 q 20 d 300 q 0 the figure shows that the percent of contaminant mass in the aquifer using the two step approach is far less than the traditional one for the same pumping rate the difference in the percent of contaminant mass for the same pumping rates is almost 15 for cases a and b further comparing the four scenarios we also observed that the difference between the two pareto optimal fronts is less prominent when the ranges of decision variables pumping rates are more by increasing the range of pumping rates we give it more weightage in the optimization model than the pumping locations this is the main reason for such behavior of the pareto front 7 sensitivity analysis of the multi objective optimization algorithms the performance of optimization algorithms highly depends on various control parameters generally the optimal values of the control parameters of an optimization algorithm can be obtained using rigorous sensitivity analysis however sensitivity analyses of the control parameters are often not required for mo cma es and mo scem both algorithms can automatically find the optimal values of the control parameters based on the population size and dimensions of the optimization problem table s4 the optimal values of the various control parameters of mo empa and nsga ii must be found using sensitivity analyses this section evaluates the sensitivities for various control parameters of mo empa and nsga ii for the groundwater remediation problem 7 1 sensitivity analysis of mo empa the parameters considered for sensitivity analysis of mo empa are the population size n distribution factor p f fish aggregating device fad mutation scaling factor m crossover operator cr and number of divisions of the adaptive grid n grid the ranges of various parameters and their default values are shown in table s4 a candidate parameter is varied within its range by keeping the other parameters to their default values for generating non dominated solutions the mo empa is executed ten times for each realization of a candidate parameter and the respective igd and sp values are computed from the non dominated solutions further the average values of igd and sp are calculated for statistical comparisons it should be noted that the least values of igd and sp indicate better solutions 7 1 1 population size n the figure shows that the igd and sp values keep decreasing with an increase in the population size n fig 15a and fig 15b however there are no significant changes in igd and sp values for a population above 100 hence an appropriate choice of population size for the problem is 100 7 1 2 distribution factor p f the values of igd and sp are minimum for the distribution factor having values of 0 6 and 0 4 respectively fig 15c and fig 15d by averaging we can choose the value of the distribution factors as 0 5 for the problem previous research also found the appropriate value of the distribution factors as 0 5 for finding minimum values of several benchmark functions 7 1 3 fish aggregating device fad in fig 15e and fig 15f the minimum values of igd and sp are obtained for fad having values of 0 3 and 0 2 respectively by averaging the fad can be set to 0 25 for the problem 7 1 4 mutation scaling factor m as shown in the figure the values of igd and sp are minimum for the mutation scaling factor of 0 045 and 0 05 respectively fig 15g and fig 15h we may select a value close to 0 0475 for the mutation scaling factor by taking an average 7 1 5 crossover operator cr in fig 15i and fig 15j the minimum values of igd and sp are obtained for crossover operators of 0 7 and 0 8 respectively hence it is appropriate to set the value of cr to 0 75 7 1 6 number of divisions of the adaptive grid n grid as shown in fig 15k there is no significant improvement in the igd for n grid greater than 30 there is also no substantial improvement in the sp for the n grid greater than 20 fig 15l hence we can select n grid close to 25 for the problem considering the above analysis the optimal control parameters of mo empa for groundwater remediation problem is n 100 p f 0 5 fad 0 25 m 0 0475 cr 0 75 n grid 25 7 2 sensitivity analysis of nsga ii this section evaluates the sensitivities of the various control parameters of nsga ii for groundwater remediation the parameters of nsga ii are the population size n crossover operator cr and mutation scaling factor m the default values of the parameters and ranges are shown in table s4 7 2 1 population size n as shown in fig 16 a b the igd and sp decrease with increasing population size n however there are no significant changes in the igd and sp for population size n above 100 hence the population size n of 100 is appropriate for the problem 7 2 2 mutation scaling factor m in fig 16 c d the igd and sp are minimum when the values of the mutation scaling factor m are 0 045 and 0 05 respectively averaging both the values the mutation scaling factor can be set to 0 0775 7 2 3 crossover operator cr in fig 16 e f the values of igd and sp are minimum for the crossover operator cr 0 8 and 0 85 respectively averaging both the values the crossover operator cr can be set to 0 825 for this problem considering the above analysis the optimal control parameters of mo empa for groundwater remediation problem is n 100 m 0 0475 cr 0 825 8 discussion the present study evaluated the effectiveness of the two step approach for multi objective groundwater remediation for the first time it should be noted that this study is significantly different from a previous study where the two step method was used for single objective groundwater remediation this study found that the two step approach is more accurate than a traditional method for the multi objective groundwater remediation design of a hypothetical unconfined aquifer in this study we also modified the random vector functional link rvfl and the marine predator algorithm mpa before applying them for groundwater remediation the methodological improvements of both algorithms are also novelties of the present study moreover the use of both algorithms for groundwater remediation is the first ever application in the field of groundwater studies it is worth mentioning that the extreme learning machine elm which is architecturally quite identical to the rvfl has already been used for groundwater remediation the main difference between rvfl and elm is that the elm does not use direct links between the input and output layers to avoid overfitting issues the present study has several limitations that should be considered to apply the two step method for real field groundwater remediation this study deliberately disregarded the uncertainties in aquifer parameters and contaminant source characterization for groundwater remediation design however these uncertainties cannot be discarded for a real field groundwater remediation design this study also assumes a static pumping policy with a single operation period in which the pumping rate of an individual pumping well remains unaltered generally a dynamic pumping policy with multiple operation periods is often more appropriate for real field groundwater remediation design a two step approach involving uncertainties in aquifer parameters contaminant sources characterization and dynamic pumping policy will be an exciting area for future research on multi objective groundwater remediation this study also found that the performances of the first step of the two step approach in obtaining optimal pumping locations do not depend significantly on the predefined pumping rate for this study the predefined pumping rate can be any value within its range excluding very high and very low pumping rates however the predefined pumping rate may impact the performance of the first step of the two step approach for more complex aquifer systems involving uncertainties in aquifer parameters and dynamic pumping policy for future applications the researcher should independently check for any possible relationship between predefined pumping rates and optimal pumping locations we recommend selecting a pumping rate capable of extracting a significant percentage of total contaminant mass from the aquifer 9 conclusion this study proposes so models based on a two step method for groundwater remediation using enhanced random vector functional link ervfl and evolutionary marine predator algorithm empa the ervfl is used as a proxy simulator of the flow and transport models enhancing computational performance in this study the weighted least square method is used to improve the generalization ability of the ervfl network where weights are computed using the kernel density estimator kde the empa is developed by modifying mpa with elimination mechanisms evolution operators and elite opposition based learning in the multi objective version of empa an archive controller and adaptive grid mechanism are used to store pareto optimal solutions in an external repository the so models are applied to a hypothetical unconfined aquifer in the first step the empa is directly integrated with the flow and transport models and used to obtain the optimal locations of extraction wells by minimizing the contaminant mass percentage in the aquifer the results violin plots and dunn and sidák s test showed the superior performance of empa over other metaheuristics in obtaining optimal locations of extraction wells in the second step the ervfl based proxy model which approximates the flow and transport models is integrated with mo empa to design multi objective groundwater remediation strategies the second step utilizes the optimal locations of extraction wells computed in the first step as input the pareto optimal solutions trade off between optimal total pumping rates and contaminant mass percentage in the aquifer obtained using the mo empa are compared with nsga ii mo cma es and mo scem from the results mo empa is better than other metaheuristics for multi objective groundwater remediation the two step approach is also compared to a traditional method of manually fixing pumping locations along the plume centreline results indicate the superiority of the two step approach over the traditional method for multi objective groundwater remediation credit authorship contribution statement partha majumder conceptualization
