15485,the treatment and disposal of sludge is a complex environmental problem because of the high moisture content herein we reported the process of fe ii activating urea hydrogen peroxide uhp to improve waste activated sludge was dewaterability for the first time fe ii uhp was proven to significantly improve was dewaterability specifically under the optimal conditions with 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss the cst srf and wcsc of was reduced from 215 3 7 5s 9 2 0 32 1012 m kg and 92 2 0 7 control to 62 3 4 3s 2 8 0 09 1012m kg and 70 4 0 4 respectively further analysis revealed that oh was generated in the fe ii uhp system and played the dominant role in enhancing was dewaterability oh was found to attack extracellular polymeric substances epss and cells causing epss fragmentation and decomposition part of epss into micro molecule organics or even inorganics and leading to cell destruction thus liberating the epss bound and cells bound water oh also degraded the protein in centrifugal liquor cl into micro molecule organics such as amino acids which could reduce the viscosity and electronegativity of cl the above facts ultimately reduced solid liquid interface interaction but increased hydrophobicity flocculation and flowability of was meanwhile the broken was flocs were then re flocculated via adsorption bridging and charge neutralization induced by fe ii and fe iii moreover fe ii uhp treatment achieved the reduction and stabilization of heavy metals of dewatered sludge which further enabled its land application finally the fe ii uhp process was found to be more attractive than the fe ii persulfate classical fenton processes and cpam in terms of cost savings and practical implementation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge dewatering fe ii urea hydrogen peroxide extracellular polymeric substances solid liquid interfacial interactions data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction waste activated sludge was management is an enormous challenge during biological wastewater treatment processes since 2008 the daily wastewater treatment capacity in china has significantly increased as a result the output of sewage sludge had grown by an average of 10 7 per year reaching more than 12 million tons of dry matter in 2020 mohurd c 2020 given that was has a high moisture content with poor dewaterability and contains infections toxic metals and persistent organic pollutants du et al 2022 feng et al 2015 luo et al 2022 its disposal has been viewed as a tough challenge for a significant economic and environmental burden gao et al 2022 due to its function in reducing sludge volume facilitating transport and even lowering leachate production from sludge dump sites dewatering is a crucial step in safe disposal of was wu et al 2020 therefore it is urgent to develop an efficient and economical conditioning technique to enhance was dewaterability many efforts have recently been made to improve was dewaterability by a range of techniques such as sonication liu et al 2021 freezing thawing she et al 2021 thermal sun et al 2022 coagulation flocculation guo et al 2017 and advanced oxidation processes aops xiao et al 2018 among these strategies aops are widely accepted due to their efficient destructiveness for extracellular polymeric substances epss and floc structures of was by generating oxidative radicals li et al 2021b liu et al 2020 wei et al 2019 and fenton process is the most widely applied aops to strengthen was dewaterability liang et al 2020 found that wcsc reduced from 89 48 to 71 98 with was being treated by1 5 mmol g tss zero valent iron and 0 6 mmol g tss h2o2 before dewetering the fundamental reason for the improvement in sludge dewatering was that oxidizing radicals generated in the system caused cell lysis and the disintegration of proteins and polysaccharides in sludge epss which released the bound water inside the net like sludge flocs unfortunately h2o2 on which the fenton method relied is considered a hazardous and unstable chemical that adversely affects its transportation and usage furthermore the requirement for extremely acidic condition i e ph 2 0 3 0 also limits the application of this method zhang et al 2015 urea hydrogen peroxide uhp ch4n2o h2o2 is a relatively inexpensive effective and environmentally friendly solid peroxide based oxidant in hydrous media uhp is decomposed slowly to form ch4n2o and h2o2 eq 1 at a controlled rate which therefore exhibit a certain level of oxidizability due to this property uhp is widely applied in organic synthesis as an oxidant gupta et al 2016 jin et al 2009 and persistent organic matter removal cheng et al 2022 compared to h2o2 the solid form of uhp is not only convenient to be handled in real world situations but also safe in transportation and storage processes besides a high h2o2 content of uhp 36 for uhp vs 30 for oxydol ensures that it exhibits better oxidation potential in same dosages cravotto et al 2007 compared to persulfate another highly effective oxidant uhp could reduce the reaction time from 60 to 15 min and there is no potential sulfur escape during application processes which has been proven to threaten the service time of equipment pipelines thus uhp was recognized to be efficient and eco friendly in practice maqbool et al 2019 1 c h 4 n 2 o h 2 o 2 c h 4 n 2 o h 2 o 2 apart from the applications mentioned above cravotto et al 2007 attempted another new direction being an additive for soil decontamination to enhance the degradation of 4 chloronaphthol it was found that when 20 30 mg feso4 was used to aid uhp treatment the degradation percent of 4 chloronaphthol increased from 10 to 99 the underlying mechanism was that the presence of fe ii catalyzed uhp to produce the strongly oxidizing and non selective hydroxyl radical oh via eq 2 this valuable finding not only improved the application field of uhp but also enlightened us to raise such a hypothesis that fe ii uhp treatment might be effective in promoting was dewaterability the price of uhp is about 485 t which is lower than that of several common oxidants such as oxone 9400 t and permanganate 13500 t li et al 2020b the added fe ii salt which is cheaper than fe iii salt 1150 t for fe iii vs 600 t for fe ii has dual functions i e as a catalyst to initiate fenton reaction in the fe ii uhp process and as a coagulant in was dewatering process in addition no toxic intermediates or products were produced in this process eqs 1 and 2 thus fe ii uhp treatment will be economically attractive and environment friendly for practical applications if it is proven to be effective to date however no information is available to whether and how fe ii uhp treatment enhances was dewatering 2 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh o h therefore the objective of this research is to evaluate the potential of the fe ii uhp technique for improving was dewaterability capillary suction time cst specific resistance of sludge srf water content of sludge cake wcsc and bound water are the primary indicators of dewaterability which were measured in this work to obtain a complete understanding of the dewatering principles solid liquid phase properties of was solid liquid interfacial interactions and radical identification were conducted to uncover their respective effect on sludge dewatering finally the practicability of fe ii uhp process was investigated using a desktop scaling up cost benefit analysis in comparison to the other common techniques of was dewatering 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the was samples were collected from the thickener of a typical municipal wastewater treatment plant located in changsha china the fundamental parameters of raw was were given in table 1 the ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o 99 uhp ch6n2o3 97 and other reagents used in this study are an analytical grade and purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd 2 2 sludge conditioning and dewatering during the conditioning tests 1 mol l of h2so4 was added to each sludge sample 600ml to adjust the solution ph to 3 5 various amount of feso4 7h2o was added to the mixture after mixing with a mechanical stirrer at 300 r min for 5 min at room temperature then various dosages of uhp were dosed to the reaction with a summary of the specifics in table 2 and the mixtures were stirred at 150 r min for 15 min after the conditioning process 250 ml of sludge samples from each reaction were removed for cst srf wcsc vacuum filtration and bound water measurements to evaluate sludge dewatering performance respectively he et al 2016 besides particle size distribution microstructure and mesoporous structure distribution of was before and after fe ii uhp conditioning were also determined another 150 ml sample was utilized for determining the membrane fluidity of microbial cells and extracting epss fractions to identify the effect of fe ii uhp on the solid phase properties of was in addition the centrifugal liquor before epss extraction was utilized for identifying the effects of fe ii uhp on the liquid phase properties of was furthermore the contact angle relative hydrophobicity and zeta potential were determined as well the flow enhancement was calculated by contact angle and average pore size of sludge wu et al 2018 these indicators could be applied to explore the effect of fe ii uhp on solid liquid interfacial interactions at last the total concentrations of heavy metals and chemical speciation of heavy metals were also determined to estimate the suitability of land application of dewatered sludge the loosely bound extracellular polymeric substance lb eps and tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance tb eps were extracted using a modified heat extraction technique li and yang 2007 in this procedure sludge was first centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min in a 50 ml tube the sludge pellet was used for the extraction of epss please see text s1 for details and the centrifugal liquor cl was recovered for analysis zhang et al 2014 after passing through a 0 45 mm membrane filter all cl lb eps and tb eps samples were tested for total organic carbon toc protein and polysaccharide in addition cl was also utilized to determine amino acids 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra and potassium k while the extracted epss were applied for the measurement of the fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum 2 3 investigations of the conditioning mechanism using tert butyl alcohol tba as the scavenger for oh radical quenching studies were carried out to identify the generation of hydroxyl radical in the process where individual uhp was added or fe ii combined with uhp liu et al 2017 six experimental groups were performed one was set as the control without reagents addition while the other five added 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss 0 01 m

values of cst and wcsc after the reaction were measured 2 4 comparison of dewatering performance among fe ii uhp fenton fe ii sps and cpam the experimental conditions in the experiment were the same as described in section 2 2 except that initial ph of was in the fe ii sps and cpam systems was not adjusted the optimal doses for fenton fe ii sps and cpam were respectively 62 5 50 fe ii h2o2 mg g tss 0 6 0 6 fe ii sps mmol g tss and 10 mg g tss according to the previous studies ge et al 2021 li et al 2022 tao et al 2022 2 5 analytical methods cst was determined by a cst instrument model 304b

details chen et al 2020 the identification of oh was performed using an electron paramagnetic resonance epr technology bruker emxplus 6 1 usa a modified hagen poiseuille equation which connects the surface wettability contact angle and nanoconfined water flow resistance in combination with the conventional hagen poiseuille equation in eq 3 was used to analyze the influences of interfacial and viscous resistances of single nanopore on water release and the water release was regarded as an enhancement process of nanoconfined water flow in the pores of sludge flocs 3 w q s t ξ d q n t d 1 8 l s t t ξ d μ t μ t ξ d where w is the flow enhancement the ratio of the actual water flux to that predicted by the conventional hagen poiseuille equation q n is the water flux obtained by the conventional hagen poiseuille equation with a true slip length of zero and bulk water viscosity q s is the water flux calculated by the corrected haagen poiseuille equation introducing an intermediate parameter ξ which is the ratio of a surface water molecule interaction to a water intermolecular interaction to simultaneously take into account the interfacial resistances indicated by l s t t ξ and viscous resistances denoted by μ wu et al 2018 wu et al 2017 therefore 1 8 l s t t ξ d is defined as the flow enhancement from the interfacial resistance and expressed as wi μ t μ t ξ d is the flow enhancement from viscous resistance and expressed as wv w wi and wv are calculated by pore size and the contact angle and the detailed information is shown in text s8 2 6 statistical analysis in this study all the tests were conducted in triplicate and the results were shown as mean standard deviation the significance of the results was evaluated by an analysis of variance and p 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant 3 result and discussion 3 1 effects of fe ii uhp treatment on sludge dewaterability the effects of fe ii uhp treatments on was dewatering performance were evaluated fig 1 individual fe ii was found to barely improve the dewatering of was with fe ii addition increasing from 0 to 60 mg g tss srf slightly reduced from 9 2 0 21 1012m kg to 8 8 0 14 1012m kg in the absence of uhp in addition individual uhp addition was observed to exert a positive effect on sludge dewatering as uhp addition increased from 0 to 60 mg g tss srf reduced from 9 2 0 21 1012m kg to 4 5 0 15 1012m kg in the absence of fe ii however it was noted that fe ii uhp was found to greatly elevate the dewaterability of was with the uhp addition increasing from 10 to 60 mg g tss srf decreased from 5 7 0 17 1012m kg to 3 9 0 12 1012m kg in the presence of 20 mg g tss fe ii and from 5 9 0 18 1012m kg to 2 6 0 08 1012m kg in the presence of 60 mg g tss fe ii the analogous tendency was also observed in the values of cst fig s1 and wcsc fig 1b however further increase of fe ii in the presence of 10 mg g tss uhp deteriorated the was dewatering performance which was likely due to that excessive addition of fe ii caused a so called scavenging effect of oh xu et al 2016 the main contributor to the improvement of sludge dewatering performance in this experiment the findings revealed that the ideal dosages were 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss and its srf cst wcsc decreased from 9 2 0 21 1012m kg 215 3 7 5s and 92 2 0 7 control to 2 8 0 09 1012m kg 62 3 4 3s and 70 4 0 4 respectively therefore this combination of dosages was employed to condition was in the following test ch4n2o from uhp disassociation is in a relatively stable state at room temperature because the heating is required to hydrolyze ch4n2o it was reported that urea could cause protein denaturation and was a protein denaturant ferreira et al 2017 therefore we speculated that urea may have a certain effect on sludge dewatering however according to our experimental result urea released by uhp was found to barely affect the dewatering of was fig s2 this might be due to the relatively low concentration of urea released from uhp in this experiment which has little impact on proteins and the efficiency of sludge dewatering free water and bound water are the two major classifications of water in sludge bound water is considered a gross estimate of three states of water including vicinal water hydration water and interstitial water vaxelaire and cezac 2004 which is hard to remove by mechanical dewatering techniques because of obstructions like colloidal microbial aggregates and the solid water affinity of highly hydrated solid compositions chen et al 2021 as determined by the endothermic curve of the dsc thermograms fig 1d the variation in the bound water content of was was shown in fig 1c it could be seen that the bound water content of sludge reduced from 2 0 0 03 g g tss to 1 6 0 03 g g tss 1 7 0 02g g tss and 1 9 0 02 g g tss after fe ii uhp uhp and fe ii treatments respectively according to the results fe ii uhp system had a better removal impact on the bound water of was than other treatments which was in favor of lowering the water holding capacity of was flocs and further increasing the dewaterability of was the change of aggregation states of bio flocs which could be reflected by particle size distribution surface area mesoporous structure distribution and microstructure inevitably influenced the sludge dewaterability wu et al 2020 according to fig 2 a the sludge sample treated with fe ii uhp had a reduced median particle size d50 than the untreated sample this might be a result of oxidation degrading the epss composition and fragmenting dense sludge flocs yu et al 2016 also discovered that the organic compounds were successfully changed from large to tiny biomolecules by the extremely reactive hydroxyl radicals produced in the fenton which successfully reduced the particle size of the sludge corresponding with the smaller particle size bet brunner emmet teller surface area increased from 3 4663 m2 g to 7 7074 m2 g and pore volume rose from 0 010738 cm³ g to 0 024204 cm³ g but the average pore diameter diminished from 24 1653 nm to 20 1598 nm after fe ii uhp treatment fig 2b the results indicated that fe ii uhp treatment reduced particle size and increased specific surface area of sludge which was reported to be detrimental to sludge dewatering however it was worth noting that sludge dewatering performance was a comprehensive performance being affected by various factors such as viscosity zeta potential and slip length thus the role of fe ii uhp in sludge dewatering was further explored these parameters in the following text obvious differences in morphologies of was between the control group and fe ii uhp were observed in fig 2c the construction of control group was platy and compact without any voids or channels in its surface the intact and tiny epss cells imbedded on the surface were grouped together and impeded water removal which caused the poor dewatering performance of was after fe ii uhp treatment however the surface of sludge presented a coarse surface a discontinuous developed porous structure and numerous small cracks traits because the complex and variable pore structures offer a variety of paths for the release of water the loose structures and specific pores in flocs conditioned by fe ii uhp had a favorable impact on the water permeability and dewaterability chen et al 2021 3 2 effects of fe ii uhp treatment on centrifugal liquor properties it could be found from fig 3 a that cl of fe ii uhp treated and uhp treated samples contained more toc than that of the control this fact suggested that both fe ii uhp and uhp treatments could enhance sludge disintegration which was further supported by the increase of polysaccharides in cl fig 3b in addition cl of fe ii uhp treated sample contained less toc than that of the uhp treated sample which may be due to the higher mineralization of organics in fe ii uhp treated sample however a decreased trend was found in protein content after various treatments the content of protein in cl was 18 5 0 23 mg g tss in the blank while the corresponding value decreased to 10 3 0 25 mg g tss in fe ii uhp pretreated sample which was lower than the values in uhp pretreated sample 15 7 0 28 mg g tss and in the fe ii pretreated sample 19 6 0 31 mg g tss this finding demonstrated that fe ii uhp treatment could effectively degrade or even mineralize sludge proteins with the protein degradation rate being greater than the protein solubilization rate from the solid phase of sludge as confirmed by the response of 3d eem spectra of cl fig s3 proteins have high water retention capacities because the nitrogen and oxygen functional groups of their molecules form hydrogen bonds trapping the water molecules in the gap between the chain macromolecules wu et al 2016 the decrease of proteins with electronegative functional groups in cl could reduce cl viscosity but increase the zeta potential liu et al 2021 additionally it was found that proteins in cl had a substantial impact on the sludge dewaterability whereas the presence of polysaccharides in cl had little bearing on the dewatering rate novak et al 2003 therefore the reduction of protein concentration in cl after fe ii uhp treatment may be one of its potential mechanisms for sludge dewatering amino acids are the main components of proteins and by products of protein decomposition after sludge oxidation treatment hou et al 2015 as shown in fig 3c we identified the effect of fe ii uhp treatment on the contents of 17 types of amino acids table s1 which consist of 8 kinds of hydrophilic amino acids and 9 kinds of hydrophobic amino acids after fe ii uhp treatment the main types of hydrophobic hydrophilic amino acids including val met lle leu phe and cys were found to be consistent with the control however an increasing trend was noted in the concentration of the total amino acids which demonstrated the degradation of proteins in cl by fe ii uhp treatment additionally proteins with high hydrophilic amino acid contents migrated with the outflow of water more readily than those with high hydrophobic ones li et al 2021 as a result after fe ii uhp treatment the proportion of total hydrophobic amino acids dropped while the fraction of hydrophilic amino acids increased in cl among them leu pro glu and lys concentrations in the control were respectively 96 27 26 67 15 83 and 6 07 μg g tss while the corresponding concentrations in the fe ii uhp treated sample were 90 60 12 97 35 60 and 22 47 μg g tss respectively fig 3c this indicated that fe ii uhp treatment decreased the proportions of hydrophobic amino acids leu and pro by 2 9 and 2 4 respectively but increased the hydrophilic amino acids glu and lys by 2 3 and 2 1 respectively the facts suggested that under the influence of fe ii uhp treatment the migration of hydrophilic proteins from the solid phase to cl led to the increase of hydrophobicity of the solid phase such as epss thus reducing its water holding capacity and enhancing the sludge dewaterability 3 3 effects of fe ii uhp treatment on solid phase properties 3 3 1 quantification and visualization of the spatial extension of epss one of the key elements determining sludge dewatering performance is assumed to be extracellular polymeric substances epss which are primarily composed of proteins and polysaccharides wang et al 2019 toc proteins and polysaccharides were measured for two kinds of epss it was observed from fig 4 a that the toc concentration of lb eps increased from 3 3 0 13 mg g tss the control to 4 3 0 16 mg g tss after fe ii uhp treatment while the corresponding datum of tb eps decreased from 3 0 0 13 mg g tss to 2 6 0 10 mg g tss this fact implied that through oxidation effects fe ii uhp induced the degradation of tb eps and part of which was further dissolved into lb eps moreover the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides in total epss after fe ii uhp pretreatment were found to decrease from 12 4 0 24 mg g tss and 2 2 0 09 mg g tss to 8 1 0 22 mg g tss and 2 0 0 09 mg g tss respectively according to the reports the hydrophilic polymers in epss could effectively trap the bound water in the flocs hence the breakdown of the polymers in epss could improve sludge dewatering performance liang et al 2020 therefore after fe ii uhp treatment effective polymer removal might significantly increase sludge floc hydrophobicity and induced the release of bound water hence improving sludge dewatering performance samples of extracted lb eps and tb eps before and after fe ii uhp treatment were analyzed using ft ir to examine functional groups as shown in fig 4c several distinct functional group peaks were observed on the ftir spectrum of the samples including stretching vibrations of the o h groups associated with hydrocarbons deformation and stretching vibrations of the c o bond amide i and n h bond amide ii of proteins vibrations of the c c c o c and o h bonds associated with polysaccharides or carbohydrates and ring vibrations of the c c and c o h bonds from aromatic amino acids and nucleotides the summary of peak assignments was presented in table s2 after fe ii uhp treatment the characteristic peak transmittance of tb eps in the 1620 cm 1 1418 1394 cm 1 and 1124 1049 cm 1 regions increased indicating the degradation of protein and polysaccharide substances in tb eps besides the transmittance of lb eps increased in 1620 cm 1 and 1418 1394 cm 1 but decreased in 1124 1049 cm 1 after fe ii uhp treatment demonstrating the reduction of proteins and the increase of polysaccharides in lb eps this was consistent with the variations of protein and polysaccharide contents in lb eps measured above epss which are found both on the outside of cells and within microbial aggregates always act as the most exterior layers of solid phase interacting with water molecules wu et al 2021 we used clsm to visualize the internal structure and epss distribution of sludge flocs before and after fe ii uhp treatment fig 4d in line with the earlier work it was found that epss were encased in the outer layer of cells and also present inside the microbial aggregates in both sludge samples the sludge sample of control group was compact and intact however after fe ii uhp treatment the sludge flocs loosened and clear floc fragmentation was noticed additionally the decreased fluorescence intensity was consistent with the variations in protein and polysaccharide contents in epss that had previously been measured the blue hue of the stained samples also became more noticeable in sludge processed with fe ii uhp indicating that more polysaccharides in the inner center of sludge flocs were exposed to the surface of the sludge flocs as the result of oxidative degradation of surface organics the above results illustrated that after fe ii uhp treatment the substances in sludge epss were greatly degraded and their spatial distribution became loose and fragmented thus improving the sludge dewaterability 3 3 2 changes in sludge cell viability the flow cytometry measurements of the fluidity of microbial cell membranes and potassium k release could be used to assess the change in cell viability flow cytometry is usually used to reflect the cell functional state and the physiological status of microorganism cells can be segmented into four regions live cells are shown in av pi q4 early apoptotic cells are shown in av pi q3 necrotic or late apoptotic cells are shown in av pi q2 and debris and damaged cells are shown in av pi q1 du et al 2021 as shown in fig 5 the fluorescence percentage of live cells was 96 3 in the blank but it dropped to 88 9 in the fe ii uhp pretreated sample which was less than that in the fe ii pretreated sample 96 7 and in the uhp pretreated sample 90 3 in addition after fe ii uhp treatment and individual uhp treatment the fluorescence percentage of early apoptotic cells increased from 1 08 to 4 02 and 3 53 respectively moreover the fluorescence percentage of debris and damaged cells of the uhp treated sample increased from 1 19 the control to 1 52 but this parameter decreased to 0 76 of the fe ii uhp treated sample this fact may be related to the flocculation of iron since the fluorescence percentage of debris and damaged cells of the fe ii treated sample decreased from 1 19 to 0 95 the above results indicated that fe ii uhp treatment could effectively induce damage to was cells and thus caused cell apoptosis or even rupture which were further confirmed by the release of potassium k the intracellular fluid of bacteria contains a significant amount of potassium and the potassium concentration released into the bulk liquid can be used to indirectly determine how well built microbial cell walls are sun et al 2018 as illustrated in fig s4 k concentration increased from 89 8 1 4 mg l the control to 104 1 1 5 mg l after fe ii uhp treatment confirming the cell damage and rupture the water in sludge is mainly divided into two categories free water and bound water bound water cannot be removed directly by mechanical force therefore the presence of bound water greatly affects the dewaterability of sludge bound water exists in epss and cells thus the destruction of the cell favors the release of bound water in the cell li et al 2022 therefore the damage of was cells after fe ii uhp treatment caused more intracellular bound water to be released which increased the free water content and enhanced the separation of sludge particles and water 3 4 effects of fe ii uhp treatment on solid liquid interfacial interactions in bio flocs of was there was typically no absolute free water and the aggregation states of sludge particles or water solid interactions could also affect the mobility of the most mobile water fractions wu et al 2018 the changes of fe ii uhp treatment on the aggregation state of sludge particles and the steric resistance of solids to water inevitably influenced the solid liquid interfacial interactions of was which could be reflected by the interfacial and viscous resistances of a single nanopore within flocs the contact angle relative hydrophobicity and zeta potential the contact angle is a crucial indicator to a solid surface wettability strongly polarized water can expand readily on a hydrophilic surface resulting in a small contact angle liu et al 2016 as could be seen in fig 6 a the contact angle of the control was 65 7 1 2 whereas the corresponding value was respectively 77 8 1 4 73 7 1 4 and 68 8 0 7 after fe ii uhp uhp and fe ii treatment this fact showed that was hydrophobicity increased after fe ii uhp treatment in line with the increased relative hydrophobicity of was fig s5 the extracellular protein structural conformations were altered as a result of flocs structure destruction after fe ii uhp treatment exposing the hidden hydrophobic sites of proteins thus increasing their hydrophobicity li et al 2020a the increase of hydrophobicity of sludge floc is beneficial to increase the content of water that does not adhere to the sludge particles that is the increase of free water content facilitates the separation of sludge and water therefore sludge treated by fe ii uhp obtained a better dewatering performance to a certain extent the hydrophobic effect electrostatic interactions and polymer bridging regulate the aggregation of was collectively wilén et al 2003 zeta potential was found to increase from 4 63 0 31 mv the control to 4 32 0 28 mv 1 17 0 02 mv and 1 06 0 02 mv after fe ii uhp and fe ii uhp treatments respectively fig 6b the fe ii uhp treatment might be able to partially release the negatively charged intracellular polymers and remove the anionic groups from the epss fractions additionally some negatively charged sludge particles were electrically neutralized by fe iii and fe ii which lowered the negative charge of sludge flocs this was confirmed by the lower ph test in the fe ii uhp after the reaction fig s6 the assuagement of electrostatic repellent interactions between particles and the flocculation and precipitation of colloidal particles were both sped up by a reduction in negative charge therefore fe ii uhp treatment could positively affect the dewatering performance of was sludge viscosity indicating the deformation of flocs as another valuable factor influencing was dewatering was observed to be negatively correlated with sludge dewaterability in the previous report liu et al 2016 it could be observed that the viscosity declined with different treatments fig s7 which suggests the improvement of sludge dewatering the pore size of sludge flocs is typically nanoscale and viscous resistance resulting from chemical bindings at the contact interface and interfacial resistance resulting from pore wall morphology are the main factors affecting the flow behavior of water in a single nanopore the interfacial resistance was reflected by the true slip characterizing the direct movement of water molecules along walls while the viscous resistance was quantified by the effective viscosity reflecting the changes in structure and dynamics of water near walls caused by the wall force wu et al 2018 wu et al 2017 the wettability of the surface plays a critical role in determining the true slip length of water at solid surfaces it was reported that hydrophilic surfaces slip longer than hydrophobic ones bocquet and charlaix 2010 as illustrated in fig 6c the true slip length increased from 0 207 nm to 0 280 nm after fe ii uhp treatment as the contact angle increased from 65 7 to 77 8 implying that a decrease in interfacial resistance occurred with an increase in interfacial hydrophobicity effective viscosity was affected by wettability and pore size whitby et al 2008 a decrease in effective viscosity after fe ii uhp treatment indicated a decrease in viscous resistance further the contribution of interfacial and viscous resistances to flow enhancement was estimated in fig 6d fe ii uhp treatment was found to enhance flow possibly resulting from the decline of interfacial resistance which was beneficial to flow enhancement of single pores of flocs a greater flow enhancement after fe ii uhp treatment indicated a better dewaterability of was fe ii uhp treatment increased the contact angle sludge relatively hydrophobic and zeta potential but reduced viscous resistance and interfacial resistance in a nanoscale pore and sludge viscosity all these analyses indicated that the aggregation state of sludge particles and the steric resistance of solids to water changed after fe ii uhp treatment which affected the hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics of the sludge surface and weakened the solid liquid interface interaction the weakening of solid liquid interface interaction reduced the water holding capacity of sludge which was conducive to the separation of sludge particles and water and improved the dewatering capacity 3 5 radicals identification to further analyze the contribution of oh to the dewaterability improvement of was classical quenching tests were carried out as illustrated in fig 7 a cst and wcsc reduction rate declined from 74 7 1 6 and 23 1 1 0 fe ii uhp to 9 2 0 5 and 2 6 0 5 in the fe ii uhp tba system and from 66 8 1 4 and 15 7 0 8 uhp to 6 4 0 5 and 1 7 0 4 in the uhp tba system the improvement of sludge dewatering performance was severely hampered by the scavenging of oh demonstrating that oh was crucial to both the fe ii uhp and individual uhp processes in addition there was more oh generated in fe ii uhp process than that in the uhp process according to the above results because oh was nearly scavenged in the presence of tba cst and wcsc reduction should reasonably come from the other processes such as the oxidation effect i e o2 and o2 and the flocculation effect of dissolved iron to further detect the generation of oh in the conditioning process electron paramagnetic resonance technology was employed and dmpo oh was detected in the fe ii uhp fe ii and uhp processes it could be seen in fig 7b that the dmpo oh signal in the uhp process was weak and completely absent in the fe ii process but it was quite strong in the fe ii uhp system this indicated that the uhp process could produce a small amount of oh and the addition of fe ii could catalyze uhp to produce more oh greatly boosting the system capacity for oxidation and enhancing sludge dewatering performance 3 6 environmental implication of fe ii uhp pretreatment for was the total concentrations of heavy metals and the chemical speciation of heavy metals were estimated the stability of acid soluble exchangeable state f1 reducible state f2 oxidizable state f3 and residual state f4 is ranked as f4 f3 f2 f1 the summation of the f1 fraction and f2 fraction can be used to characterize the sludge toxicity and bioavailability as demonstrated in fig s8 after fe ii uhp treatment the sum of f1 and f2 fractions of zn cd cr pb as and ni in the dewatered sludge cake decreased from 65 9 50 0 4 2 4 0 35 9 and 24 6 to 62 5 48 7 2 4 2 4 18 8 and 17 1 respectively on the contrary the sum of f1 and f2 fractions of cu increased from 0 9 to 10 1 which was probably due to the chelating ability of active groups to soluble cu being weakened in presence of other metals the above facts indicated that fe ii uhp treatment decreased the toxicity and bioavailability of the dewatered sludge which was inconsistent with several previous reports that advanced oxidation reduced the stability of heavy metals in sludge cake and this difference might be attributed to different operating conditions e g the structure composition and combination of heavy metals of the tested sludge and the characteristics of the researched treatment itself e g oxidative capacity and active ingredients ge et al 2019 the wcsc of sludge after the fe ii uhp treatment by 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss reduced to 70 4 which was lower than that of fenton 73 2 fe ii persulfate 74 1 and cpam 79 7 fig s9 widely used in the dewatering process the information presented above demonstrated that fe ii uhp treatment seemed to be a feasible and efficient method for improving sludge dewaterability to further evaluate the engineering applicability of fe ii uhp a preliminary cost benefit analysis was performed under a sewage treatment plant taking a monthly production of 100000 m3 was water content 99 as an example table s3 the monthly cost of the fe ii uhp process in the conditioning and disposal processes was 1 181 680 which was lower than that of the fe ii persulfate process 1 972 380 fenton process 1 266 550 and cpam 1 640 830 according to this result fe ii uhp process might be a promising technique for sludge dewatering in the future however it should be noted that in addition to the cost of conditioning chemicals accurate calculations should be also taken into account the present value equivalent annual worth the market for renewable energy exchange local labor conditions device maintenance frequency and the cost for mechanical dewatering wang et al 2019 more importantly in real world scenarios the results can vary widely depending on operator skills land prices and discharge standards as a result a full scale investigation is still required to legitimately assess the economic and environmental benefits of the fe ii uhp process 4 conclusion in this work fe ii uhp treatment was proposed and the relevant dewatering mechanism was also revealed results showed that cst srf wcsc and bound water of sludge treated in the presence of 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss decreased substantially radical determination and scavenging experiments indicated that oh was produced in the fe ii uhp process and played the dominant role in protein degradation in cl cell destruction sludge disruption and water liberation which resulted in the conversion of bound water into free water and change of surface characteristics of the sludge additionally the fe ii uhp conditioned sludge displayed a porous structure that allowed the outflow of free water under high pressure meanwhile fe ii and fe iii improved the flocculation by neutralizing negative charges and compressing double electric layers of sludge flocs it was also found that the fe ii uhp based sludge dewatering process reduced and stabilized the heavy metal content of the dewatered sludge the economic study demonstrated that the fe ii uhp was a promising process for sludge dewatering enhancement and subsequent

15485,the treatment and disposal of sludge is a complex environmental problem because of the high moisture content herein we reported the process of fe ii activating urea hydrogen peroxide uhp to improve waste activated sludge was dewaterability for the first time fe ii uhp was proven to significantly improve was dewaterability specifically under the optimal conditions with 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss the cst srf and wcsc of was reduced from 215 3 7 5s 9 2 0 32 1012 m kg and 92 2 0 7 control to 62 3 4 3s 2 8 0 09 1012m kg and 70 4 0 4 respectively further analysis revealed that oh was generated in the fe ii uhp system and played the dominant role in enhancing was dewaterability oh was found to attack extracellular polymeric substances epss and cells causing epss fragmentation and decomposition part of epss into micro molecule organics or even inorganics and leading to cell destruction thus liberating the epss bound and cells bound water oh also degraded the protein in centrifugal liquor cl into micro molecule organics such as amino acids which could reduce the viscosity and electronegativity of cl the above facts ultimately reduced solid liquid interface interaction but increased hydrophobicity flocculation and flowability of was meanwhile the broken was flocs were then re flocculated via adsorption bridging and charge neutralization induced by fe ii and fe iii moreover fe ii uhp treatment achieved the reduction and stabilization of heavy metals of dewatered sludge which further enabled its land application finally the fe ii uhp process was found to be more attractive than the fe ii persulfate classical fenton processes and cpam in terms of cost savings and practical implementation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge dewatering fe ii urea hydrogen peroxide extracellular polymeric substances solid liquid interfacial interactions data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction waste activated sludge was management is an enormous challenge during biological wastewater treatment processes since 2008 the daily wastewater treatment capacity in china has significantly increased as a result the output of sewage sludge had grown by an average of 10 7 per year reaching more than 12 million tons of dry matter in 2020 mohurd c 2020 given that was has a high moisture content with poor dewaterability and contains infections toxic metals and persistent organic pollutants du et al 2022 feng et al 2015 luo et al 2022 its disposal has been viewed as a tough challenge for a significant economic and environmental burden gao et al 2022 due to its function in reducing sludge volume facilitating transport and even lowering leachate production from sludge dump sites dewatering is a crucial step in safe disposal of was wu et al 2020 therefore it is urgent to develop an efficient and economical conditioning technique to enhance was dewaterability many efforts have recently been made to improve was dewaterability by a range of techniques such as sonication liu et al 2021 freezing thawing she et al 2021 thermal sun et al 2022 coagulation flocculation guo et al 2017 and advanced oxidation processes aops xiao et al 2018 among these strategies aops are widely accepted due to their efficient destructiveness for extracellular polymeric substances epss and floc structures of was by generating oxidative radicals li et al 2021b liu et al 2020 wei et al 2019 and fenton process is the most widely applied aops to strengthen was dewaterability liang et al 2020 found that wcsc reduced from 89 48 to 71 98 with was being treated by1 5 mmol g tss zero valent iron and 0 6 mmol g tss h2o2 before dewetering the fundamental reason for the improvement in sludge dewatering was that oxidizing radicals generated in the system caused cell lysis and the disintegration of proteins and polysaccharides in sludge epss which released the bound water inside the net like sludge flocs unfortunately h2o2 on which the fenton method relied is considered a hazardous and unstable chemical that adversely affects its transportation and usage furthermore the requirement for extremely acidic condition i e ph 2 0 3 0 also limits the application of this method zhang et al 2015 urea hydrogen peroxide uhp ch4n2o h2o2 is a relatively inexpensive effective and environmentally friendly solid peroxide based oxidant in hydrous media uhp is decomposed slowly to form ch4n2o and h2o2 eq 1 at a controlled rate which therefore exhibit a certain level of oxidizability due to this property uhp is widely applied in organic synthesis as an oxidant gupta et al 2016 jin et al 2009 and persistent organic matter removal cheng et al 2022 compared to h2o2 the solid form of uhp is not only convenient to be handled in real world situations but also safe in transportation and storage processes besides a high h2o2 content of uhp 36 for uhp vs 30 for oxydol ensures that it exhibits better oxidation potential in same dosages cravotto et al 2007 compared to persulfate another highly effective oxidant uhp could reduce the reaction time from 60 to 15 min and there is no potential sulfur escape during application processes which has been proven to threaten the service time of equipment pipelines thus uhp was recognized to be efficient and eco friendly in practice maqbool et al 2019 1 c h 4 n 2 o h 2 o 2 c h 4 n 2 o h 2 o 2 apart from the applications mentioned above cravotto et al 2007 attempted another new direction being an additive for soil decontamination to enhance the degradation of 4 chloronaphthol it was found that when 20 30 mg feso4 was used to aid uhp treatment the degradation percent of 4 chloronaphthol increased from 10 to 99 the underlying mechanism was that the presence of fe ii catalyzed uhp to produce the strongly oxidizing and non selective hydroxyl radical oh via eq 2 this valuable finding not only improved the application field of uhp but also enlightened us to raise such a hypothesis that fe ii uhp treatment might be effective in promoting was dewaterability the price of uhp is about 485 t which is lower than that of several common oxidants such as oxone 9400 t and permanganate 13500 t li et al 2020b the added fe ii salt which is cheaper than fe iii salt 1150 t for fe iii vs 600 t for fe ii has dual functions i e as a catalyst to initiate fenton reaction in the fe ii uhp process and as a coagulant in was dewatering process in addition no toxic intermediates or products were produced in this process eqs 1 and 2 thus fe ii uhp treatment will be economically attractive and environment friendly for practical applications if it is proven to be effective to date however no information is available to whether and how fe ii uhp treatment enhances was dewatering 2 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh o h therefore the objective of this research is to evaluate the potential of the fe ii uhp technique for improving was dewaterability capillary suction time cst specific resistance of sludge srf water content of sludge cake wcsc and bound water are the primary indicators of dewaterability which were measured in this work to obtain a complete understanding of the dewatering principles solid liquid phase properties of was solid liquid interfacial interactions and radical identification were conducted to uncover their respective effect on sludge dewatering finally the practicability of fe ii uhp process was investigated using a desktop scaling up cost benefit analysis in comparison to the other common techniques of was dewatering 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the was samples were collected from the thickener of a typical municipal wastewater treatment plant located in changsha china the fundamental parameters of raw was were given in table 1 the ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o 99 uhp ch6n2o3 97 and other reagents used in this study are an analytical grade and purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd 2 2 sludge conditioning and dewatering during the conditioning tests 1 mol l of h2so4 was added to each sludge sample 600ml to adjust the solution ph to 3 5 various amount of feso4 7h2o was added to the mixture after mixing with a mechanical stirrer at 300 r min for 5 min at room temperature then various dosages of uhp were dosed to the reaction with a summary of the specifics in table 2 and the mixtures were stirred at 150 r min for 15 min after the conditioning process 250 ml of sludge samples from each reaction were removed for cst srf wcsc vacuum filtration and bound water measurements to evaluate sludge dewatering performance respectively he et al 2016 besides particle size distribution microstructure and mesoporous structure distribution of was before and after fe ii uhp conditioning were also determined another 150 ml sample was utilized for determining the membrane fluidity of microbial cells and extracting epss fractions to identify the effect of fe ii uhp on the solid phase properties of was in addition the centrifugal liquor before epss extraction was utilized for identifying the effects of fe ii uhp on the liquid phase properties of was furthermore the contact angle relative hydrophobicity and zeta potential were determined as well the flow enhancement was calculated by contact angle and average pore size of sludge wu et al 2018 these indicators could be applied to explore the effect of fe ii uhp on solid liquid interfacial interactions at last the total concentrations of heavy metals and chemical speciation of heavy metals were also determined to estimate the suitability of land application of dewatered sludge the loosely bound extracellular polymeric substance lb eps and tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance tb eps were extracted using a modified heat extraction technique li and yang 2007 in this procedure sludge was first centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min in a 50 ml tube the sludge pellet was used for the extraction of epss please see text s1 for details and the centrifugal liquor cl was recovered for analysis zhang et al 2014 after passing through a 0 45 mm membrane filter all cl lb eps and tb eps samples were tested for total organic carbon toc protein and polysaccharide in addition cl was also utilized to determine amino acids 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra and potassium k while the extracted epss were applied for the measurement of the fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum 2 3 investigations of the conditioning mechanism using tert butyl alcohol tba as the scavenger for oh radical quenching studies were carried out to identify the generation of hydroxyl radical in the process where individual uhp was added or fe ii combined with uhp liu et al 2017 six experimental groups were performed one was set as the control without reagents addition while the other five added 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss 0 01 m tba 35 mg g tss uhp 35 mg g tss uhp 0 01 m tba 0 01 m tba the experimental conditions in the radical quenching experiment were set in the same way as those for the reactions adjusted in this work the values of cst and wcsc after the reaction were measured 2 4 comparison of dewatering performance among fe ii uhp fenton fe ii sps and cpam the experimental conditions in the experiment were the same as described in section 2 2 except that initial ph of was in the fe ii sps and cpam systems was not adjusted the optimal doses for fenton fe ii sps and cpam were respectively 62 5 50 fe ii h2o2 mg g tss 0 6 0 6 fe ii sps mmol g tss and 10 mg g tss according to the previous studies ge et al 2021 li et al 2022 tao et al 2022 2 5 analytical methods cst was determined by a cst instrument model 304b

surface wettability contact angle and nanoconfined water flow resistance in combination with the conventional hagen poiseuille equation in eq 3 was used to analyze the influences of interfacial and viscous resistances of single nanopore on water release and the water release was regarded as an enhancement process of nanoconfined water flow in the pores of sludge flocs 3 w q s t ξ d q n t d 1 8 l s t t ξ d μ t μ t ξ d where w is the flow enhancement the ratio of the actual water flux to that predicted by the conventional hagen poiseuille equation q n is the water flux obtained by the conventional hagen poiseuille equation with a true slip length of zero and bulk water viscosity q s is the water flux calculated by the corrected haagen poiseuille equation introducing an intermediate parameter ξ which is the ratio of a surface water molecule interaction to a water intermolecular interaction to simultaneously take into account the interfacial resistances indicated by l s t t ξ and viscous resistances denoted by μ wu et al 2018 wu et al 2017 therefore 1 8 l s t t ξ d is defined as the flow enhancement from the interfacial resistance and expressed as wi μ t μ t ξ d is the flow enhancement from viscous resistance and expressed as wv w wi and wv are calculated by pore size and the contact angle and the detailed information is shown in text s8 2 6 statistical analysis in this study all the tests were conducted in triplicate and the results were shown as mean standard deviation the significance of the results was evaluated by an analysis of variance and p 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant 3 result and discussion 3 1 effects of fe ii uhp treatment on sludge dewaterability the effects of fe ii uhp treatments on was dewatering performance were evaluated fig 1 individual fe ii was found to barely improve the dewatering of was with fe ii addition increasing from 0 to 60 mg g tss srf slightly reduced from 9 2 0 21 1012m kg to 8 8 0 14 1012m kg in the absence of uhp in addition individual uhp addition was observed to exert a positive effect on sludge dewatering as uhp addition increased from 0 to 60 mg g tss srf reduced from 9 2 0 21 1012m kg to 4 5 0 15 1012m kg in the absence of fe ii however it was noted that fe ii uhp was found to greatly elevate the dewaterability of was with the uhp addition increasing from 10 to 60 mg g tss srf decreased from 5 7 0 17 1012m kg to 3 9 0 12 1012m kg in the presence of 20 mg g tss fe ii and from 5 9 0 18 1012m kg to 2 6 0 08 1012m kg in the presence of 60 mg g tss fe ii the analogous tendency was also observed in the values of cst fig s1 and wcsc fig 1b however further increase of fe ii in the presence of 10 mg g tss uhp deteriorated the was dewatering performance which was likely due to that excessive addition of fe ii caused a so called scavenging effect of oh xu et al 2016 the main contributor to the improvement of sludge dewatering performance in this experiment the findings revealed that the ideal dosages were 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss and its srf cst wcsc decreased from 9 2 0 21 1012m kg 215 3 7 5s and 92 2 0 7 control to 2 8 0 09 1012m kg 62 3 4 3s and 70 4 0 4 respectively therefore this combination of dosages was employed to condition was in the following test ch4n2o from uhp disassociation is in a relatively stable state at room temperature because the heating is required to hydrolyze ch4n2o it was reported that urea could cause protein denaturation and was a protein denaturant ferreira et al 2017 therefore we speculated that urea may have a certain effect on sludge dewatering however according to our experimental result urea released by uhp was found to barely affect the dewatering of was fig s2 this might be due to the relatively low concentration of urea released from uhp in this experiment which has little impact on proteins and the efficiency of sludge dewatering free water and bound water are the two major classifications of water in sludge bound water is considered a gross estimate of three states of water including vicinal water hydration water and interstitial water vaxelaire and cezac 2004 which is hard to remove by mechanical dewatering techniques because of obstructions like colloidal microbial aggregates and the solid water affinity of highly hydrated solid compositions chen et al 2021 as determined by the endothermic curve of the dsc thermograms fig 1d the variation in the bound water content of was was shown in fig 1c it could be seen that the bound water content of sludge reduced from 2 0 0 03 g g tss to 1 6 0 03 g g tss 1 7 0 02g g tss and 1 9 0 02 g g tss after fe ii uhp uhp and fe ii treatments respectively according to the results fe ii uhp system had a better removal impact on the bound water of was than other treatments which was in favor of lowering the water holding capacity of was flocs and further increasing the dewaterability of was the change of aggregation states of bio flocs which could be reflected by particle size distribution surface area mesoporous structure distribution and microstructure inevitably influenced the sludge dewaterability wu et al 2020 according to fig 2 a the sludge sample treated with fe ii uhp had a reduced median particle size d50 than the untreated sample this might be a result of oxidation degrading the epss composition and fragmenting dense sludge flocs yu et al 2016 also discovered that the organic compounds were successfully changed from large to tiny biomolecules by the extremely reactive hydroxyl radicals produced in the fenton which successfully reduced the particle size of the sludge corresponding with the smaller particle size bet brunner emmet teller surface area increased from 3 4663 m2 g to 7 7074 m2 g and pore volume rose from 0 010738 cm³ g to 0 024204 cm³ g but the average pore diameter diminished from 24 1653 nm to 20 1598 nm after fe ii uhp treatment fig 2b the results indicated that fe ii uhp treatment reduced particle size and increased specific surface area of sludge which was reported to be detrimental to sludge dewatering however it was worth noting that sludge dewatering performance was a comprehensive performance being affected by various factors such as viscosity zeta potential and slip length thus the role of fe ii uhp in sludge dewatering was further explored these parameters in the following text obvious differences in morphologies of was between the control group and fe ii uhp were observed in fig 2c the construction of control group was platy and compact without any voids or channels in its surface the intact and tiny epss cells imbedded on the surface were grouped together and impeded water removal which caused the poor dewatering performance of was after fe ii uhp treatment however the surface of sludge presented a coarse surface a discontinuous developed porous structure and numerous small cracks traits because the complex and variable pore structures offer a variety of paths for the release of water the loose structures and specific pores in flocs conditioned by fe ii uhp had a favorable impact on the water permeability and dewaterability chen et al 2021 3 2 effects of fe ii uhp treatment on centrifugal liquor properties it could be found from fig 3 a that cl of fe ii uhp treated and uhp treated samples contained more toc than that of the control this fact suggested that both fe ii uhp and uhp treatments could enhance sludge disintegration which was further supported by the increase of polysaccharides in cl fig 3b in addition cl of fe ii uhp treated sample contained less toc than that of the uhp treated sample which may be due to the higher mineralization of organics in fe ii uhp treated sample however a decreased trend was found in protein content after various treatments the content of protein in cl was 18 5 0 23 mg g tss in the blank while the corresponding value decreased to 10 3 0 25 mg g tss in fe ii uhp pretreated sample which was lower than the values in uhp pretreated sample 15 7 0 28 mg g tss and in the fe ii pretreated sample 19 6 0 31 mg g tss this finding demonstrated that fe ii uhp treatment could effectively degrade or even mineralize sludge proteins with the protein degradation rate being greater than the protein solubilization rate from the solid phase of sludge as confirmed by the response of 3d eem spectra of cl fig s3 proteins have high water retention capacities because the nitrogen and oxygen functional groups of their molecules form hydrogen bonds trapping the water molecules in the gap between the chain macromolecules wu et al 2016 the decrease of proteins with electronegative functional groups in cl could reduce cl viscosity but increase the zeta potential liu et al 2021 additionally it was found that proteins in cl had a substantial impact on the sludge dewaterability whereas the presence of polysaccharides in cl had little bearing on the dewatering rate novak et al 2003 therefore the reduction of protein concentration in cl after fe ii uhp treatment may be one of its potential mechanisms for sludge dewatering amino acids are the main components of proteins and by products of protein decomposition after sludge oxidation treatment hou et al 2015 as shown in fig 3c we identified the effect of fe ii uhp treatment on the contents of 17 types of amino acids table s1 which consist of 8 kinds of hydrophilic amino acids and 9 kinds of hydrophobic amino acids after fe ii uhp treatment the main types of hydrophobic hydrophilic amino acids including val met lle leu phe and cys were found to be consistent with the control however an increasing trend was noted in the concentration of the total amino acids which demonstrated the degradation of proteins in cl by fe ii uhp treatment additionally proteins with high hydrophilic amino acid contents migrated with the outflow of water more readily than those with high hydrophobic ones li et al 2021 as a result after fe ii uhp treatment the proportion of total hydrophobic amino acids dropped while the fraction of hydrophilic amino acids increased in cl among them leu pro glu and lys concentrations in the control were respectively 96 27 26 67 15 83 and 6 07 μg g tss while the corresponding concentrations in the fe ii uhp treated sample were 90 60 12 97 35 60 and 22 47 μg g tss respectively fig 3c this indicated that fe ii uhp treatment decreased the proportions of hydrophobic amino acids leu and pro by 2 9 and 2 4 respectively but increased the hydrophilic amino acids glu and lys by 2 3 and 2 1 respectively the facts suggested that under the influence of fe ii uhp treatment the migration of hydrophilic proteins from the solid phase to cl led to the increase of hydrophobicity of the solid phase such as epss thus reducing its water holding capacity and enhancing the sludge dewaterability 3 3 effects of fe ii uhp treatment on solid phase properties 3 3 1 quantification and visualization of the spatial extension of epss one of the key elements determining sludge dewatering performance is assumed to be extracellular polymeric substances epss which are primarily composed of proteins and polysaccharides wang et al 2019 toc proteins and polysaccharides were measured for two kinds of epss it was observed from fig 4 a that the toc concentration of lb eps increased from 3 3 0 13 mg g tss the control to 4 3 0 16 mg g tss after fe ii uhp treatment while the corresponding datum of tb eps decreased from 3 0 0 13 mg g tss to 2 6 0 10 mg g tss this fact implied that through oxidation effects fe ii uhp induced the degradation of tb eps and part of which was further dissolved into lb eps moreover the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides in total epss after fe ii uhp pretreatment were found to decrease from 12 4 0 24 mg g tss and 2 2 0 09 mg g tss to 8 1 0 22 mg g tss and 2 0 0 09 mg g tss respectively according to the reports the hydrophilic polymers in epss could effectively trap the bound water in the flocs hence the breakdown of the polymers in epss could improve sludge dewatering performance liang et al 2020 therefore after fe ii uhp treatment effective polymer removal might significantly increase sludge floc hydrophobicity and induced the release of bound water hence improving sludge dewatering performance samples of extracted lb eps and tb eps before and after fe ii uhp treatment were analyzed using ft ir to examine functional groups as shown in fig 4c several distinct functional group peaks were observed on the ftir spectrum of the samples including stretching vibrations of the o h groups associated with hydrocarbons deformation and stretching vibrations of the c o bond amide i and n h bond amide ii of proteins vibrations of the c c c o c and o h bonds associated with polysaccharides or carbohydrates and ring vibrations of the c c and c o h bonds from aromatic amino acids and nucleotides the summary of peak assignments was presented in table s2 after fe ii uhp treatment the characteristic peak transmittance of tb eps in the 1620 cm 1 1418 1394 cm 1 and 1124 1049 cm 1 regions increased indicating the degradation of protein and polysaccharide substances in tb eps besides the transmittance of lb eps increased in 1620 cm 1 and 1418 1394 cm 1 but decreased in 1124 1049 cm 1 after fe ii uhp treatment demonstrating the reduction of proteins and the increase of polysaccharides in lb eps this was consistent with the variations of protein and polysaccharide contents in lb eps measured above epss which are found both on the outside of cells and within microbial aggregates always act as the most exterior layers of solid phase interacting with water molecules wu et al 2021 we used clsm to visualize the internal structure and epss distribution of sludge flocs before and after fe ii uhp treatment fig 4d in line with the earlier work it was found that epss were encased in the outer layer of cells and also present inside the microbial aggregates in both sludge samples the sludge sample of control group was compact and intact however after fe ii uhp treatment the sludge flocs loosened and clear floc fragmentation was noticed additionally the decreased fluorescence intensity was consistent with the variations in protein and polysaccharide contents in epss that had previously been measured the blue hue of the stained samples also became more noticeable in sludge processed with fe ii uhp indicating that more polysaccharides in the inner center of sludge flocs were exposed to the surface of the sludge flocs as the result of oxidative degradation of surface organics the above results illustrated that after fe ii uhp treatment the substances in sludge epss were greatly degraded and their spatial distribution became loose and fragmented thus improving the sludge dewaterability 3 3 2 changes in sludge cell viability the flow cytometry measurements of the fluidity of microbial cell membranes and potassium k release could be used to assess the change in cell viability flow cytometry is usually used to reflect the cell functional state and the physiological status of microorganism cells can be segmented into four regions live cells are shown in av pi q4 early apoptotic cells are shown in av pi q3 necrotic or late apoptotic cells are shown in av pi q2 and debris and damaged cells are shown in av pi q1 du et al 2021 as shown in fig 5 the fluorescence percentage of live cells was 96 3 in the blank but it dropped to 88 9 in the fe ii uhp pretreated sample which was less than that in the fe ii pretreated sample 96 7 and in the uhp pretreated sample 90 3 in addition after fe ii uhp treatment and individual uhp treatment the fluorescence percentage of early apoptotic cells increased from 1 08 to 4 02 and 3 53 respectively moreover the fluorescence percentage of debris and damaged cells of the uhp treated sample increased from 1 19 the control to 1 52 but this parameter decreased to 0 76 of the fe ii uhp treated sample this fact may be related to the flocculation of iron since the fluorescence percentage of debris and damaged cells of the fe ii treated sample decreased from 1 19 to 0 95 the above results indicated that fe ii uhp treatment could effectively induce damage to was cells and thus caused cell apoptosis or even rupture which were further confirmed by the release of potassium k the intracellular fluid of bacteria contains a significant amount of potassium and the potassium concentration released into the bulk liquid can be used to indirectly determine how well built microbial cell walls are sun et al 2018 as illustrated in fig s4 k concentration increased from 89 8 1 4 mg l the control to 104 1 1 5 mg l after fe ii uhp treatment confirming the cell damage and rupture the water in sludge is mainly divided into two categories free water and bound water bound water cannot be removed directly by mechanical force therefore the presence of bound water greatly affects the dewaterability of sludge bound water exists in epss and cells thus the destruction of the cell favors the release of bound water in the cell li et al 2022 therefore the damage of was cells after fe ii uhp treatment caused more intracellular bound water to be released which increased the free water content and enhanced the separation of sludge particles and water 3 4 effects of fe ii uhp treatment on solid liquid interfacial interactions in bio flocs of was there was typically no absolute free water and the aggregation states of sludge particles or water solid interactions could also affect the mobility of the most mobile water fractions wu et al 2018 the changes of fe ii uhp treatment on the aggregation state of sludge particles and the steric resistance of solids to water inevitably influenced the solid liquid interfacial interactions of was which could be reflected by the interfacial and viscous resistances of a single nanopore within flocs the contact angle relative hydrophobicity and zeta potential the contact angle is a crucial indicator to a solid surface wettability strongly polarized water can expand readily on a hydrophilic surface resulting in a small contact angle liu et al 2016 as could be seen in fig 6 a the contact angle of the control was 65 7 1 2 whereas the corresponding value was respectively 77 8 1 4 73 7 1 4 and 68 8 0 7 after fe ii uhp uhp and fe ii treatment this fact showed that was hydrophobicity increased after fe ii uhp treatment in line with the increased relative hydrophobicity of was fig s5 the extracellular protein structural conformations were altered as a result of flocs structure destruction after fe ii uhp treatment exposing the hidden hydrophobic sites of proteins thus increasing their hydrophobicity li et al 2020a the increase of hydrophobicity of sludge floc is beneficial to increase the content of water that does not adhere to the sludge particles that is the increase of free water content facilitates the separation of sludge and water therefore sludge treated by fe ii uhp obtained a better dewatering performance to a certain extent the hydrophobic effect electrostatic interactions and polymer bridging regulate the aggregation of was collectively wilén et al 2003 zeta potential was found to increase from 4 63 0 31 mv the control to 4 32 0 28 mv 1 17 0 02 mv and 1 06 0 02 mv after fe ii uhp and fe ii uhp treatments respectively fig 6b the fe ii uhp treatment might be able to partially release the negatively charged intracellular polymers and remove the anionic groups from the epss fractions additionally some negatively charged sludge particles were electrically neutralized by fe iii and fe ii which lowered the negative charge of sludge flocs this was confirmed by the lower ph test in the fe ii uhp after the reaction fig s6 the assuagement of electrostatic repellent interactions between particles and the flocculation and precipitation of colloidal particles were both sped up by a reduction in negative charge therefore fe ii uhp treatment could positively affect the dewatering performance of was sludge viscosity indicating the deformation of flocs as another valuable factor influencing was dewatering was observed to be negatively correlated with sludge dewaterability in the previous report liu et al 2016 it could be observed that the viscosity declined with different treatments fig s7 which suggests the improvement of sludge dewatering the pore size of sludge flocs is typically nanoscale and viscous resistance resulting from chemical bindings at the contact interface and interfacial resistance resulting from pore wall morphology are the main factors affecting the flow behavior of water in a single nanopore the interfacial resistance was reflected by the true slip characterizing the direct movement of water molecules along walls while the viscous resistance was quantified by the effective viscosity reflecting the changes in structure and dynamics of water near walls caused by the wall force wu et al 2018 wu et al 2017 the wettability of the surface plays a critical role in determining the true slip length of water at solid surfaces it was reported that hydrophilic surfaces slip longer than hydrophobic ones bocquet and charlaix 2010 as illustrated in fig 6c the true slip length increased from 0 207 nm to 0 280 nm after fe ii uhp treatment as the contact angle increased from 65 7 to 77 8 implying that a decrease in interfacial resistance occurred with an increase in interfacial hydrophobicity effective viscosity was affected by wettability and pore size whitby et al 2008 a decrease in effective viscosity after fe ii uhp treatment indicated a decrease in viscous resistance further the contribution of interfacial and viscous resistances to flow enhancement was estimated in fig 6d fe ii uhp treatment was found to enhance flow possibly resulting from the decline of interfacial resistance which was beneficial to flow enhancement of single pores of flocs a greater flow enhancement after fe ii uhp treatment indicated a better dewaterability of was fe ii uhp treatment increased the contact angle sludge relatively hydrophobic and zeta potential but reduced viscous resistance and interfacial resistance in a nanoscale pore and sludge viscosity all these analyses indicated that the aggregation state of sludge particles and the steric resistance of solids to water changed after fe ii uhp treatment which affected the hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics of the sludge surface and weakened the solid liquid interface interaction the weakening of solid liquid interface interaction reduced the water holding capacity of sludge which was conducive to the separation of sludge particles and water and improved the dewatering capacity 3 5 radicals identification to further analyze the contribution of oh to the dewaterability improvement of was classical quenching tests were carried out as illustrated in fig 7 a cst and wcsc reduction rate declined from 74 7 1 6 and 23 1 1 0 fe ii uhp to 9 2 0 5 and 2 6 0 5 in the fe ii uhp tba system and from 66 8 1 4 and 15 7 0 8 uhp to 6 4 0 5 and 1 7 0 4 in the uhp tba system the improvement of sludge dewatering performance was severely hampered by the scavenging of oh demonstrating that oh was crucial to both the fe ii uhp and individual uhp processes in addition there was more oh generated in fe ii uhp process than that in the uhp process according to the above results because oh was nearly scavenged in the presence of tba cst and wcsc reduction should reasonably come from the other processes such as the oxidation effect i e o2 and o2 and the flocculation effect of dissolved iron to further detect the generation of oh in the conditioning process electron paramagnetic resonance technology was employed and dmpo oh was detected in the fe ii uhp fe ii and uhp processes it could be seen in fig 7b that the dmpo oh signal in the uhp process was weak and completely absent in the fe ii process but it was quite strong in the fe ii uhp system this indicated that the uhp process could produce a small amount of oh and the addition of fe ii could catalyze uhp to produce more oh greatly boosting the system capacity for oxidation and enhancing sludge dewatering performance 3 6 environmental implication of fe ii uhp pretreatment for was the total concentrations of heavy metals and the chemical speciation of heavy metals were estimated the stability of acid soluble exchangeable state f1 reducible state f2 oxidizable state f3 and residual state f4 is ranked as f4 f3 f2 f1 the summation of the f1 fraction and f2 fraction can be used to characterize the sludge toxicity and bioavailability as demonstrated in fig s8 after fe ii uhp treatment the sum of f1 and f2 fractions of zn cd cr pb as and ni in the dewatered sludge cake decreased from 65 9 50 0 4 2 4 0 35 9 and 24 6 to 62 5 48 7 2 4 2 4 18 8 and 17 1 respectively on the contrary the sum of f1 and f2 fractions of cu increased from 0 9 to 10 1 which was probably due to the chelating ability of active groups to soluble cu being weakened in presence of other metals the above facts indicated that fe ii uhp treatment decreased the toxicity and bioavailability of the dewatered sludge which was inconsistent with several previous reports that advanced oxidation reduced the stability of heavy metals in sludge cake and this difference might be attributed to different operating conditions e g the structure composition and combination of heavy metals of the tested sludge and the characteristics of the researched treatment itself e g oxidative capacity and active ingredients ge et al 2019 the wcsc of sludge after the fe ii uhp treatment by 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss reduced to 70 4 which was lower than that of fenton 73 2 fe ii persulfate 74 1 and cpam 79 7 fig s9 widely used in the dewatering process the information presented above demonstrated that fe ii uhp treatment seemed to be a feasible and efficient method for improving sludge dewaterability to further evaluate the engineering applicability of fe ii uhp a preliminary cost benefit analysis was performed under a sewage treatment plant taking a monthly production of 100000 m3 was water content 99 as an example table s3 the monthly cost of the fe ii uhp process in the conditioning and disposal processes was 1 181 680 which was lower than that of the fe ii persulfate process 1 972 380 fenton process 1 266 550 and cpam 1 640 830 according to this result fe ii uhp process might be a promising technique for sludge dewatering in the future however it should be noted that in addition to the cost of conditioning chemicals accurate calculations should be also taken into account the present value equivalent annual worth the market for renewable energy exchange local labor conditions device maintenance frequency and the cost for mechanical dewatering wang et al 2019 more importantly in real world scenarios the results can vary widely depending on operator skills land prices and discharge standards as a result a full scale investigation is still required to legitimately assess the economic and environmental benefits of the fe ii uhp process 4 conclusion in this work fe ii uhp treatment was proposed and the relevant dewatering mechanism was also revealed results showed that cst srf wcsc and bound water of sludge treated in the presence of 60 35 fe ii uhp mg g tss decreased substantially radical determination and scavenging experiments indicated that oh was produced in the fe ii uhp process and played the dominant role in protein degradation in cl cell destruction sludge disruption and water liberation which resulted in the conversion of bound water into free water and change of surface characteristics of the sludge additionally the fe ii uhp conditioned sludge displayed a porous structure that allowed the outflow of free water under high pressure meanwhile fe ii and fe iii improved the flocculation by neutralizing negative charges and compressing double electric layers of sludge flocs it was also found that the fe ii uhp based sludge dewatering process reduced and stabilized the heavy metal content of the dewatered sludge the economic study demonstrated that the fe ii uhp was a promising process for sludge dewatering enhancement and subsequent

15486,consumption of amphetamine and methamphetamine two common illicit drugs has been monitored by wastewater based epidemiology wbe in many countries over the past decade there is potential for the estimated amount of amphetamine used to be skewed at locations where methamphetamine is also consumed because amphetamine is also excreted to wastewater following methamphetamine consumption the present study aims to review the available data in the literature to identify an average ratio of amphetamine methamphetamine amp meth that is excreted to wastewater after methamphetamine consumption this ratio could then be used to refine the estimation of amphetamine consumption in catchments where there is both amphetamine and methamphetamine use using data from more than 6000 wastewater samples from australia where methamphetamine is the dominant illicit amphetamine type substance on the market we were able to subtract the contribution of legal sources of amphetamine contribution and obtain the median amp meth ratio in wastewater of 0 09 using this value the amphetamine derived from methamphetamine consumption can be calculated and subtracted from the total amphetamine mass loads in wastewater samples without considering the contribution of amphetamine from methamphetamine use selected european catchments with comparable consumption of amphetamine and methamphetamine showed up to 83 overestimation of amphetamine use for catchments with amp meth ratio greater than 1 00 the impact of amphetamine from methamphetamine would be negligible for catchments with amp meth ratio in the range of 0 04 0 19 it will be difficult to accurately estimate amphetamine consumption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords amphetamine like substances chemical ratios drug consumption wastewater analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been used in many large scale programs for monitoring illicit drug consumption around the world the most notable wbe programs for illicit drug monitoring are the sewage analyses core group europe score in europe that currently involves more than 20 countries gonzalez mariño et al 2020 ort et al 2019 thomas et al 2012 and the national wastewater drug monitoring program nwdmp in australia that covers up to 70 of the total population acic 2021 back estimation of drug consumption by wbe involves the measurement of concentrations of consumption biomarkers in wastewater samples ideally the biomarkers should be unique to the consumption of the parent drug and stable in wastewater e g the metabolite benzoylecgonine is unique to cocaine consumption and meets the criteria of a suitable biomarker choi et al 2018 daughton 2012 gracia lor et al 2017 however in wbe studies amphetamine consumption has been estimated by amphetamine itself which is not unique but easy to measure in wastewater because it is one of the main excretion products following ingestion cody and schwarzhoff 1993 and is relatively stable in sewers li et al 2021 thai et al 2014 since amphetamine is also a metabolite of methamphetamine the consumption of methamphetamine would contribute to the total amphetamine mass load in the wastewater sample gonzalez mariño et al 2020 amphetamine in wastewater can also originate from the legal consumption of pharmaceuticals such as lisdexamfetamine and dexamfetamine khan and nicell 2012 both types of contribution should be subtracted from the total amphetamine mass load in wastewater to avoid overestimations of illicit consumption while the legal source of amphetamine can be estimated from prescription data the amount of amphetamine generated by illicit methamphetamine consumption can only be derived directly from wastewater samples due to its illicit nature it has been suggested that enantiomeric profiling could be used to differentiate whether amphetamine in wastewater is from methamphetamine or amphetamine consumption since illicit amphetamine is often used in racemic form while methamphetamine is often used in its s enantiomer and it only produces s amphetamine castrignano et al 2018 estévez danta et al 2021 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 xu et al 2017 however enantiomeric analysis is costly because it requires analysis using specific chiral column and longer run time meanwhile a simpler approach has been proposed by gao et al to use the amp meth ratio as an indicator of sporadic amphetamine consumption because the ratio is relatively constant 0 18 0 05 in a regional catchment and 0 16 0 03 in an urban catchment where methamphetamine is predominantly used over seven years gao et al 2018 gao et al suggested that in catchments where there was occasional illicit amphetamine use the ratio of amp meth would increase in agreement with the detection of r amphetamine the use of an amp meth ratio to estimate amphetamine consumption by wbe in areas where both amphetamine and methamphetamine are used if determined would be helpful since no additional resources are needed to use the ratio while amp meth ratio from methamphetamine use can be derived from traditional pharmacokinetic studies using urine analysis results it has been found that wastewater derived values can provide estimates that matched better with other data sources such as sales or prescription data gao et al 2021 thai et al 2019 2021 therefore the aim of the present study was to estimate a factor that reflects the amount of amphetamine excreted following the consumption of methamphetamine by both urine and wastewater data this ampmeth methmeth factor was then used to calculate the amphetamine mass load produced by methamphetamine consumption the amphetamine mass load derived from methamphetamine consumption was subtracted from the total amphetamine mass loads to estimate amphetamine consumption the new factor was then be used to refine the amphetamine consumption estimates in selected european catchments where the calculated amp meth ratios in wastewater were high and both amphetamine and methamphetamine were likely being used 2 materials and methods 2 1 amp meth in urine after meth consumption before compiling the wbe data we conducted a literature search of clinical urine studies reporting amp and meth urine levels from meth users using google scholar and web of science portal key words of methamphetamine amphetamine and urine were used and results were screened to get amphetamine in human urine samples after methamphetamine use we excluded studies focused on method development and those that reported concentrations of spiked urine samples in total 17 journal articles were found and the amp meth ratio in urine samples was calculated and shown in table 1 additionally the information about the administration route dosages age of participants duration of urine samples and the enantiomeric profile are listed when available we also compared our search results with a previous review on the same topic khan and nicell 2012 2 2 wbe data collection wbe data either mass loads or concentrations for amphetamine and methamphetamine in wastewater were collected around the globe table s1 some of these datasets have been published in the form of journal articles and reports acic 2017 bijlsma et al 2021 cruz cruz et al 2021 du et al 2015 gonzalez mariño et al 2020 kim et al 2015 ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 the data included in this study except canada and mexico were subject to the multi year inter laboratory qa qc practice organized by the score group which ensured the high quality of the dataset van nuijs et al 2018 2 3 calculation of the amp meth ratio amp meth ratios were calculated using amphetamine and methamphetamine mass loads in wastewater the amp meth ratio in wastewater from australia was specifically examined because of its known high methamphetamine use acic 2022 aihw 2018 lai et al 2016 and the ability to exclude the contribution from legal pharmaceuticals with corresponding prescription data available gao et al 2021 the licit amphetamine consumption table s2 was subtracted from the mass load of amphetamine in wastewater to get the ampmeth methmeth which reflects only illicit consumption of methamphetamine without illicit amphetamine consumption eq 1 for catchment without data of legal amphetamine sources the mass loads of amphetamine and methamphetamine were used to calculate the amp meth and compared with the results from australia to understand the consumption of amphetamine and methamphetamine 1 ampmeth methmeth a m p w w a m p l s m e t h w w where ampww is the amphetamine mass load measured in wastewater samples mg day 1000 inh ampls is the amphetamine mass load derived from legal sources mg day 1000 inh and methww is the methamphetamine mass load in wastewater samples mg day 1000 inh dexamfetamine lisdexamfetamine and selegiline all produce amphetamine as a metabolite the detailed calculation of legal sources of amphetamine in australia is presented in table s2 based on the national data these three pharmaceuticals contributed from 9 8 to 21 9 mg day 1000 inh of amphetamine mass load in australian wastewater during 2016 2021 assuming complete use of all the prescriptions of these drugs this legal contribution was assumed to have homogenous use across the population and was subtracted when calculating ampmeth methmeth in australia due to the geographical variations of legal amphetamine sources there were some negative amp meth data points 966 out of 7099 after the subtraction these 966 negative values were excluded for the statistical analysis 2 4 refining the calculation of amphetamine consumption in selected european cities we selected a subset of catchments in the european score network where both amphetamine and methamphetamine were detected https www emcdda europa eu publications html pods waste water analysis en section1 these european cities had high amp meth ratios and have different amphetamine and methamphetamine consumption patterns these cities were used as test areas to evaluate differences of amphetamine consumption with and without considering the impact of methamphetamine consumption amphetamine consumption was calculated with eq 2 and without eq 3 the subtraction of amphetamine derived from methamphetamine and the results were compared 2 amp 1 consumption mg day 1000 inh m a m p m m e t h a m p m e t h m e t h m e t h c f a m p p o p u l a t i o n 3 amp 2

day and mmeth is the mass load of methamphetamine calculated from methamphetamine concentration mg l multiplied by the corresponding daily flow l day ampmeth methmeth is the ratio identified from the australian dataset as in section 2 3 which can be used to deduct the amphetamine mass load derived from methamphetamine consumption in the catchment with both amphetamine and methamphetamine use as in a previous study the amphetamine correction factor cfamp of 2 77 was used to account for the 36 of the consumed amphetamine excreted unchanged which translates the wastewater mass load to consumption gracia lor et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 amp meth ratio in urine the amp meth ratios in urine samples of methamphetamine users reported in the reviewed literature were 0 04 0 27 among studies conducted with different routes of administration and doses ranging between 1 and 30 mg day person table 1 the enantiomeric profiles of administered methamphetamine would affect the urinary amp meth ratios the metabolism of s methamphetamine produces considerably more amphetamine and consequently a higher amp meth ratio than the metabolism of r methamphetamine cody and schwarzhoff 1993 li et al 2010a it should be noted that illicit methamphetamine is mostly s enantiomer cody and schwarzhoff 1993 the mean value of amp meth ratio was 0 06 after consumption of r methamphetamine in four studies with both intravenous injection i v or oral administration while the amp meth ratios vary from 0 15 to 0 27 with a mean value of 0 20 when only s methamphetamine is consumed these results highlighted the variations of metabolism and excretion due to the enantiomeric differences route of administration dosages and urine ph and would lead to variation of the amp meth in wastewater it should be noted that some of the pharmacokinetic studies measured the concentration of amphetamine and methamphetamine only in periodic urine samples not pooled 24 h or 48 h samples therefore the deviations could also be attributed to the differences of amp meth in different periodic urine samples and pooled urine khan and nicell 2012 also compiled most of the studies in table 1 and shared similar conclusions about the effect of enantiomeric profiles and route of administration our analysis of the literature highlights the fact that even if s methamphetamine products were used by the same route there could be considerable variations of the amp meth ratio this variation would also complicate any back calculations of doses and care should be taken to choose an appropriate excretion factor 3 2 the amp meth ratios in wastewater 3 2 1 australian data set with more than 6000 data points the australian data provided the largest wbe dataset on amphetamine and methamphetamine mass load in wastewater after the subtraction of legal pharmaceutical contribution to the amphetamine mass load the mean value of ampmeth methmeth ratio across 2016 2021 was 0 11 0 10 mean sd and the geometric mean was 0 09 with coefficient of variation of 88 the median value was 0 09 the 10th and 90th percentile were 0 04 and 0 19 respectively and the 95 confidence interval of the mean was between 0 09 to 0 14 this ratio assumes the illicit consumption of amphetamine was negligible fig 1 the amp meth ratio was 0 13 0 11 with the median value as 0 12 without the legal sources subtraction detailed statistical analysis of the datasets are presented in text s2 the significantly higher value kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 0001 of amp meth without legal amphetamine sources subtraction indicates that when evaluating the amp meth ratios and or amphetamine consumption legal sources contribution should be considered a previous study suggested when the ratio of amp meth is high it could indicate additional consumption of amphetamine and or clandestine production and discharge of amphetamine production waste to the sewers gao et al 2018 conversely when amp meth 0 04 it could indicate extra sources of methamphetamine discharged into the wastewater stream other than consumption possibly direct disposal of methamphetamine or clandestine lab discharge since methamphetamine was the predominant amphetamine like substance used in australia during the investigated period australian criminal intelligence commission 2018 2020 and considering we subtracted the legal prescription pharmaceutical contribution to amphetamine mass load in wastewater we assume no other sources contributed to the mass load of amphetamine in wastewater apart from methamphetamine consumption afp 2021 aihw 2018 we suggest that the median value of 0 09 should be the representative ampmeth methmeth that would be expected in wastewater after methamphetamine consumption it should be noted that if the amp meth ratios fall between 0 04 0 19 due to factors as discussed in section 3 4 it would be difficult to accurately estimate amphetamine consumption 3 2 2 american and european data set the amp meth ratios in wastewater from seattle usa during 2015 2019 experienced a gradual decrease fig 2 the considerably higher amp meth ratios in seattle than australian cities can be attributed to the significant contribution from legal sources where 80 100 mg day 1000 inh are estimated from prescription use of amphetamine and lisdexamfetamine arcos 2020 accounting for as much as 90 of the total amphetamine mass load in wastewater seattle also has high methamphetamine use from 650 mg day 1000 inh in 2015 to 1660 mg day 1000 inh in 2018 and 2019 which also contributes amphetamine mass load to the wastewater table s3 these two major contributors of amphetamine account for all of the amphetamine in wastewater and suggest that illicit use of amphetamine in seattle is negligible the amp meth ratio in montreal and granby in canada 2015 was 0 08 0 20 with a median of 0 16 which is slightly lower than seattle figure s1 however another sampling campaign conducted in 2011 in two canadian wwtps found quite high amp meth ratios in one catchment 0 71 3 09 while the other catchment had no detection of methamphetamine the reason for these high ratios is unknown but indicates that the consumption of amphetamine and methamphetamine varies within canada yargeau et al 2014 the median ratio of amp meth in 15 mexican catchments was 0 18 but there were 2 catchments with very high values up to 127 indicating possible disposal of amphetamine cruz cruz et al 2021 the amp meth ratio in prague 0 11 0 01 and bratislava 0 12 0 05 with predominant methamphetamine consumption were also similar to the ratios observed in australia fig 2 s1 emcdda 2019 2020 unlike the relatively narrow range in prague and bratislava the amp meth ratios in barcelona 0 96 0 57 and oslo 3 62 2 52 indicate much higher amphetamine than methamphetamine consumption and high daily variations and yearly fluctuations were observed in the dataset the ratios in limassol 0 33 0 32 and milan 0 24 0 10 also fluctuated considerably among different years it is noteworthy for the ratios of milan because of the relatively low consumption of methamphetamine amphetamine was below the method quantification limits in some years and therefore the ratio was not available for those years table s4 s5 due to the lack of prescription data we can t exclude the amphetamine contribution from legal sources in these european cities but more accurate amphetamine consumption estimates can be achieved with ampmeth subtraction as shown in section 3 3 3 2 3 asian and african dataset the yearly mean values of amp meth ratios in beijing were 0 09 to 0 38 during 2012 2017 suggesting sporadic amphetamine consumption although there was no reported seizures of amphetamine in china during this period and survey data also indicated little amphetamine consumption unodc 2020 the amp meth ratios in south korea 0 16 0 04 kim et al 2015 were higher than australia which indicates there was some licit and or illicit amphetamine consumption along with illicit methamphetamine consumption the amp meth ratio in wastewater from vietnam was 0 13 0 03 hue et al 2022 which was similar to the observations in australia and survey and police seizure evidence also suggest methamphetamine is the predominant amphetamine like substances used unodc 2019 however the amp meth ratio in malaysia du et al 2020 and south africa archer et al 2018 were 0 07 0 01 and 0 04 0 01 these low amp meth ratios could be attributed to the consumption of racemic or r methamphetamine as has been found in seized samples hamdan et al 2015 3 3 re estimation of amphetamine consumption in selected european catchments if amphetamine consumption was derived directly from its mass loads without accounting for the contribution from methamphetamine consumption using eq 3 there could be up to 83 differences compared with estimations using the ampmeth methmeth using eq 2 table 2 large differences were observed in milan 19 83 barcelona 28 77 in 2019 and neuchetel 18 82 in 2014 where there were comparable consumptions of amphetamine and methamphetamine table s5 s6 it is noteworthy that when the amp meth ratio is greater than 1 00 which indicates much higher amphetamine consumption than methamphetamine consumption the differences were less than 10 the amp meth ratios in athens declined from 3 41 to 0 57 during 2013 2017 table s4 and the amphetamine consumption was also decreasing from 11 7 to 1 4 mg day 1000 inh in the same period table s6 in contrast the amp meth ratio increased from 0 34 to 0 68 during 2014 2015 in neuchatel and amphetamine consumption increased from 398 mg day 1000 inh to 845 mg day 1000 inh during the same period amphetamine consumption in the two finnish cities were several tens to hundreds of times higher than the other cites and the amp meth ratio in jyväskylä and savonlinna were also much higher than other european cities the fact that amphetamine is the predominant amphetamine like substance used in the nordic countries is also reflected in the seizure data table s7 therefore the use of ampmeth methmeth would most affect the accuracy of amphetamine consumption in catchments with comparable consumption of amphetamine and methamphetamine amp meth ratio between 0 20 1 00 whereas for catchments where either amphetamine or methamphetamine consumption is dominant the differences of using or not using ampmeth methmeth would be negligible 3 4 limitations and future perspective there are several factors that can affect amp meth ratios in wastewater and we acknowledge these limitations firstly the enantiomeric profile of consumed methamphetamine would affect the amp meth ratio in wastewater understanding the general enantiomeric profile of methamphetamine used in the catchment would help to improve the interpretation of amp meth ratios in wastewater secondly the median amp meth ratio of 0 09 determined from australian wastewater data assumes no significant levels of illicit amphetamine consumption and the licit source of amphetamine was homogenous across the country we acknowledge that there is probably some illicit amphetamine use as reported in the national drug strategy household survey results and the police seizure data however this would be an insignificant amount in comparison to amphetamine produced from methamphetamine consumption and have little effect on our determined ratio afp 2017 aihw 2018 therefore there would be some error for catchments with much higher or lower consumption of dexamfetamine and lisdexamfetamine than national average value thirdly prescription use of amphetamine methamphetamine and their precursor pharmaceuticals such as selegiline and lisdexamfetamine in australia spain and seattle has been found to contribute 20 to more than 100 of amphetamine mass load in wastewater therefore our estimated illicit amphetamine consumption in selected european cities may still be overestimations due to the lack of data about legal amphetamine sources cody 2002 estévez danta et al 2021 khan and nicell 2012 overall the amp meth ratios in wastewater of the catchments with predominant methamphetamine use were lower than what could be estimated from pharmacokinetic studies the reason for this discrepancy is unknown but could be attributed to the possible in sewer degradation of amphetamine mccall et al 2016 when evaluating the illicit amphetamine consumption it s important to check the legal amphetamine sources for catchments with amp meth ratios in the range of 0 20 1 00 it is recommended to use the value of 0 09 derived from this study to subtract the amphetamine mass load from methamphetamine use for catchments with amp meth ratio in the range of 0 04 0 19 the uncertainty of illicit amphetamine consumption

15486,consumption of amphetamine and methamphetamine two common illicit drugs has been monitored by wastewater based epidemiology wbe in many countries over the past decade there is potential for the estimated amount of amphetamine used to be skewed at locations where methamphetamine is also consumed because amphetamine is also excreted to wastewater following methamphetamine consumption the present study aims to review the available data in the literature to identify an average ratio of amphetamine methamphetamine amp meth that is excreted to wastewater after methamphetamine consumption this ratio could then be used to refine the estimation of amphetamine consumption in catchments where there is both amphetamine and methamphetamine use using data from more than 6000 wastewater samples from australia where methamphetamine is the dominant illicit amphetamine type substance on the market we were able to subtract the contribution of legal sources of amphetamine contribution and obtain the median amp meth ratio in wastewater of 0 09 using this value the amphetamine derived from methamphetamine consumption can be calculated and subtracted from the total amphetamine mass loads in wastewater samples without considering the contribution of amphetamine from methamphetamine use selected european catchments with comparable consumption of amphetamine and methamphetamine showed up to 83 overestimation of amphetamine use for catchments with amp meth ratio greater than 1 00 the impact of amphetamine from methamphetamine would be negligible for catchments with amp meth ratio in the range of 0 04 0 19 it will be difficult to accurately estimate amphetamine consumption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords amphetamine like substances chemical ratios drug consumption wastewater analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been used in many large scale programs for monitoring illicit drug consumption around the world the most notable wbe programs for illicit drug monitoring are the sewage analyses core group europe score in europe that currently involves more than 20 countries gonzalez mariño et al 2020 ort et al 2019 thomas et al 2012 and the national wastewater drug monitoring program nwdmp in australia that covers up to 70 of the total population acic 2021 back estimation of drug consumption by wbe involves the measurement of concentrations of consumption biomarkers in wastewater samples ideally the biomarkers should be unique to the consumption of the parent drug and stable in wastewater e g the metabolite benzoylecgonine is unique to cocaine consumption and meets the criteria of a suitable biomarker choi et al 2018 daughton 2012 gracia lor et al 2017 however in wbe studies amphetamine consumption has been estimated by amphetamine itself which is not unique but easy to measure in wastewater because it is one of the main excretion products following ingestion cody and schwarzhoff 1993 and is relatively stable in sewers li et al 2021 thai et al 2014 since amphetamine is also a metabolite of methamphetamine the consumption of methamphetamine would contribute to the total amphetamine mass load in the wastewater sample gonzalez mariño et al 2020 amphetamine in wastewater can also originate from the legal consumption of pharmaceuticals such as lisdexamfetamine and dexamfetamine khan and nicell 2012 both types of contribution should be subtracted from the total amphetamine mass load in wastewater to avoid overestimations of illicit consumption while the legal source of amphetamine can be estimated from prescription data the amount of amphetamine generated by illicit methamphetamine consumption can only be derived directly from wastewater samples due to its illicit nature it has been suggested that enantiomeric profiling could be used to differentiate whether amphetamine in wastewater is from methamphetamine or amphetamine consumption since illicit amphetamine is often used in racemic form while methamphetamine is often used in its s enantiomer and it only produces s amphetamine castrignano et al 2018 estévez danta et al 2021 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 xu et al 2017 however enantiomeric analysis is costly because it requires analysis using specific chiral column and longer run time meanwhile a simpler approach has been proposed by gao et al to use the amp meth ratio as an indicator of sporadic amphetamine consumption because the ratio is relatively constant 0 18 0 05 in a regional catchment and 0 16 0 03 in an urban catchment where methamphetamine is predominantly used over seven years gao et al 2018 gao et al suggested that in catchments where there was occasional illicit amphetamine use the ratio of amp meth would increase in agreement with the detection of r amphetamine the use of an amp meth ratio to estimate amphetamine consumption by wbe in areas where both amphetamine and methamphetamine are used if determined would be helpful since no additional resources are needed to use the ratio while amp meth ratio from methamphetamine use can be derived from traditional pharmacokinetic studies using urine analysis results it has been found that wastewater derived values can provide estimates that matched better with other data sources such as sales or prescription data gao et al 2021 thai et al 2019 2021 therefore the aim of the present study was to estimate a factor that reflects the amount of amphetamine excreted following the consumption of methamphetamine by both urine and wastewater data this ampmeth methmeth factor was then used to calculate the amphetamine mass load produced by methamphetamine consumption the amphetamine mass load derived from methamphetamine consumption was subtracted from the total amphetamine mass loads to estimate amphetamine consumption the new factor was then be used to refine the amphetamine consumption estimates in selected european catchments where the calculated amp meth ratios in wastewater were high and both amphetamine and methamphetamine were likely being used 2 materials and methods 2 1 amp meth in urine after meth consumption before compiling the wbe data we conducted a literature search of clinical urine studies reporting amp and meth urine levels from meth users using google scholar and web of science portal key words of methamphetamine amphetamine and urine were used and results were screened to get amphetamine in human urine samples after methamphetamine use we excluded studies focused on method development and those that reported concentrations of spiked urine samples in total 17 journal articles were found and the amp meth ratio in urine samples was calculated and shown in table 1 additionally the information about the administration route dosages age of participants duration of urine samples and the enantiomeric profile are listed when available we also compared our search results with a previous review on the same topic khan and nicell 2012 2 2 wbe data collection wbe data either mass loads or concentrations for amphetamine and methamphetamine in wastewater were collected around the globe table s1 some of these datasets have been published in the form of journal articles and reports acic 2017 bijlsma et al 2021 cruz cruz et al 2021 du et al 2015 gonzalez mariño et al 2020 kim et al 2015 ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 the data included in this study except canada and mexico were subject to the multi year inter laboratory qa qc practice organized by the score group which ensured the high quality of the dataset van nuijs et al 2018 2 3 calculation of the amp meth ratio amp meth ratios were calculated using amphetamine and methamphetamine mass loads in wastewater the amp meth ratio in wastewater from australia was specifically examined because of its known high methamphetamine use acic 2022 aihw 2018 lai et al 2016 and the ability to exclude the contribution from legal pharmaceuticals with corresponding prescription data available gao et al 2021 the licit amphetamine consumption table s2 was subtracted from the mass load of amphetamine in wastewater to get the ampmeth methmeth which reflects only illicit consumption of methamphetamine without illicit amphetamine consumption eq 1 for catchment without data of legal amphetamine sources the mass loads of amphetamine and methamphetamine were used to calculate the amp meth and compared with the results from australia to understand the consumption of amphetamine and methamphetamine 1 ampmeth methmeth a m p w w a m p l s m e t h w w where ampww is the amphetamine mass load measured in wastewater samples mg day 1000 inh ampls is the amphetamine mass load derived from legal sources mg day 1000 inh and methww is the methamphetamine mass load in wastewater samples mg day 1000 inh dexamfetamine lisdexamfetamine and selegiline all produce amphetamine as a metabolite the detailed calculation of legal sources of amphetamine in australia is presented in table s2 based on the national data these three pharmaceuticals contributed from 9 8 to 21 9 mg day 1000 inh of amphetamine mass load in australian wastewater during 2016 2021 assuming complete use of all the prescriptions of these drugs this legal contribution was assumed to have homogenous use across the population and was subtracted when calculating ampmeth methmeth in australia due to the geographical variations of legal amphetamine sources there were some negative amp meth data points 966 out of 7099 after the subtraction these 966 negative values were excluded for the statistical analysis 2 4 refining the calculation of amphetamine consumption in selected european cities we selected a subset of catchments in the european score network where both amphetamine and methamphetamine were detected https www emcdda europa eu publications html pods waste water analysis en section1 these european cities had high amp meth ratios and have different amphetamine and methamphetamine consumption patterns these cities were used as test areas to evaluate differences of amphetamine consumption with and without considering the impact of methamphetamine consumption amphetamine consumption was calculated with eq 2 and without eq 3 the subtraction of amphetamine derived from methamphetamine and the results were compared 2 amp 1 consumption mg day 1000 inh m a m p m m e t h a m p m e t h m e t h m e t h c f a m p p o p u l a t i o n 3 amp 2

day and mmeth is the mass load of methamphetamine calculated from methamphetamine concentration mg l multiplied by the corresponding daily flow l day ampmeth methmeth is the ratio identified from the australian dataset as in section 2 3 which can be used to deduct the amphetamine mass load derived from methamphetamine consumption in the catchment with both amphetamine and methamphetamine use as in a previous study the amphetamine correction factor cfamp of 2 77 was used to account for the 36 of the consumed amphetamine excreted unchanged which translates the wastewater mass load to consumption gracia lor et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 amp meth ratio in urine the amp meth ratios in urine samples of methamphetamine users reported in the reviewed literature were 0 04 0 27 among studies conducted with different routes of administration and doses ranging between 1 and 30 mg day person table 1 the enantiomeric profiles of administered methamphetamine would affect the urinary amp meth ratios the metabolism of s methamphetamine produces considerably more amphetamine and consequently a higher amp meth ratio than the metabolism of r methamphetamine cody and schwarzhoff 1993 li et al 2010a it should be noted that illicit methamphetamine is mostly s enantiomer cody and schwarzhoff 1993 the mean value of amp meth ratio was 0 06 after consumption of r methamphetamine in four studies with both intravenous injection i v or oral administration while the amp meth ratios vary from 0 15 to 0 27 with a mean value of 0 20 when only s methamphetamine is consumed these results highlighted the variations of metabolism and excretion due to the enantiomeric differences route of administration dosages and urine ph and would lead to variation of the amp meth in wastewater it should be noted that some of the pharmacokinetic studies measured the concentration of amphetamine and methamphetamine only in periodic urine samples not pooled 24 h or 48 h samples therefore the deviations could also be attributed to the differences of amp meth in different periodic urine samples and pooled urine khan and nicell 2012 also compiled most of the studies in table 1 and shared similar conclusions about the effect of enantiomeric profiles and route of administration our analysis of the literature highlights the fact that even if s methamphetamine products were used by the same route there could be considerable variations of the amp meth ratio this variation would also complicate any back calculations of doses and care should be taken to choose an appropriate excretion factor 3 2 the amp meth ratios in wastewater 3 2 1 australian data set with more than 6000 data points the australian data provided the largest wbe dataset on amphetamine and methamphetamine mass load in wastewater after the subtraction of legal pharmaceutical contribution to the amphetamine mass load the mean value of ampmeth methmeth ratio across 2016 2021 was 0 11 0 10 mean sd and the geometric mean was 0 09 with coefficient of variation of 88 the median value was 0 09 the 10th and 90th percentile were 0 04 and 0 19 respectively and the 95 confidence interval of the mean was between 0 09 to 0 14 this ratio assumes the illicit consumption of amphetamine was negligible fig 1 the amp meth ratio was 0 13 0 11 with the median value as 0 12 without the legal sources subtraction detailed statistical analysis of the datasets are presented in text s2 the significantly higher value kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 0001 of amp meth without legal amphetamine sources subtraction indicates that when evaluating the amp meth ratios and or amphetamine consumption legal sources contribution should be considered a previous study suggested when the ratio of amp meth is high it could indicate additional consumption of amphetamine and or clandestine production and discharge of amphetamine production waste to the sewers gao et al 2018 conversely when amp meth 0 04 it could indicate extra sources of methamphetamine discharged into the wastewater stream other than consumption possibly direct disposal of methamphetamine or clandestine lab discharge since methamphetamine was the predominant amphetamine like substance used in australia during the investigated period australian criminal intelligence commission 2018 2020 and considering we subtracted the legal prescription pharmaceutical contribution to amphetamine mass load in wastewater we assume no other sources contributed to the mass load of amphetamine in wastewater apart from methamphetamine consumption afp 2021 aihw 2018 we suggest that the median value of 0 09 should be the representative ampmeth methmeth that would be expected in wastewater after methamphetamine consumption it should be noted that if the amp meth ratios fall between 0 04 0 19 due to factors as discussed in section 3 4 it would be difficult to accurately estimate amphetamine consumption 3 2 2 american and european data set the amp meth ratios in wastewater from seattle usa during 2015 2019 experienced a gradual decrease fig 2 the considerably higher amp meth ratios in seattle than australian cities can be attributed to the significant contribution from legal sources where 80 100 mg day 1000 inh are estimated from prescription use of amphetamine and lisdexamfetamine arcos 2020 accounting for as much as 90 of the total amphetamine mass load in wastewater seattle also has high methamphetamine use from 650 mg day 1000 inh in 2015 to 1660 mg day 1000 inh in 2018 and 2019 which also contributes amphetamine mass load to the wastewater table s3 these two major contributors of amphetamine account for all of the amphetamine in wastewater and suggest that illicit use of amphetamine in seattle is negligible the amp meth ratio in montreal and granby in canada 2015 was 0 08 0 20 with a median of 0 16 which is slightly lower than seattle figure s1 however another sampling campaign conducted in 2011 in two canadian wwtps found quite high amp meth ratios in one catchment 0 71 3 09 while the other catchment had no detection of methamphetamine the reason for these high ratios is unknown but indicates that the consumption of amphetamine and methamphetamine varies within canada yargeau et al 2014 the median ratio of amp meth in 15 mexican catchments was 0 18 but there were 2 catchments with very high values up to 127 indicating possible disposal of amphetamine cruz cruz et al 2021 the amp meth ratio in prague 0 11 0 01 and bratislava 0 12 0 05 with predominant methamphetamine consumption were also similar to the ratios observed in australia fig 2 s1 emcdda 2019 2020 unlike the relatively narrow range in prague and bratislava the amp meth ratios in barcelona 0 96 0 57 and oslo 3 62 2 52 indicate much higher amphetamine than methamphetamine consumption and high daily variations and yearly fluctuations were observed in the dataset the ratios in limassol 0 33 0 32 and milan 0 24 0 10 also fluctuated considerably among different years it is noteworthy for the ratios of milan because of the relatively low consumption of methamphetamine amphetamine was below the method quantification limits in some years and therefore the ratio was not available for those years table s4 s5 due to the lack of prescription data we can t exclude the amphetamine contribution from legal sources in these european cities but more accurate amphetamine consumption estimates can be achieved with ampmeth subtraction as shown in section 3 3 3 2 3 asian and african dataset the yearly mean values of amp meth ratios in beijing were 0 09 to 0 38 during 2012 2017 suggesting sporadic amphetamine consumption although there was no reported seizures of amphetamine in china during this period and survey data also indicated little amphetamine consumption unodc 2020 the amp meth ratios in south korea 0 16 0 04 kim et al 2015 were higher than australia which indicates there was some licit and or illicit amphetamine consumption along with illicit methamphetamine consumption the amp meth ratio in wastewater from vietnam was 0 13 0 03 hue et al 2022 which was similar to the observations in australia and survey and police seizure evidence also suggest methamphetamine is the predominant amphetamine like substances used unodc 2019 however the amp meth ratio in malaysia du et al 2020 and south africa archer et al 2018 were 0 07 0 01 and 0 04 0 01 these low amp meth ratios could be attributed to the consumption of racemic or r methamphetamine as has been found in seized samples hamdan et al 2015 3 3 re estimation of amphetamine consumption in selected european catchments if amphetamine consumption was derived directly from its mass loads without accounting for the contribution from methamphetamine consumption using eq 3 there could be up to 83 differences compared with estimations using the ampmeth methmeth using eq 2 table 2 large differences were observed in milan 19 83 barcelona 28 77 in 2019 and neuchetel 18 82 in 2014 where there were comparable consumptions of amphetamine and methamphetamine table s5 s6 it is noteworthy that when the amp meth ratio is greater than 1 00 which indicates much higher amphetamine consumption than methamphetamine consumption the differences were less than 10 the amp meth ratios in athens declined from 3 41 to 0 57 during 2013 2017 table s4 and the amphetamine consumption was also decreasing from 11 7 to 1 4 mg day 1000 inh in the same period table s6 in contrast the amp meth ratio increased from 0 34 to 0 68 during 2014 2015 in neuchatel and amphetamine consumption increased from 398 mg day 1000 inh to 845 mg day 1000 inh during the same period amphetamine consumption in the two finnish cities were several tens to hundreds of times higher than the other cites and the amp meth ratio in jyväskylä and savonlinna were also much higher than other european cities the fact that amphetamine is the predominant amphetamine like substance

15487,although iron salts such as iron iii chloride fecl3 have widespread application in wastewater treatment safety concerns limit their use due to the corrosive nature of concentrated solutions this study demonstrates that local electrochemical generation of iron is a viable alternative to the use of iron salts three laboratory systems with anaerobic membrane processes were set up to treat real wastewater two systems used the production of either in situ or ex situ electrochemical iron as fe2 and fe2 fe3 2o4 respectively while the other system served as a control these systems were operated for over one year to assess the impact of electrochemically produced iron on system performance the results showed that dosing of electrochemical iron significantly reduced sulfide concentration in effluent and hydrogen sulfide content in biogas and mitigated organics based membrane fouling all of which are critical issues inherently related to sustainability of anaerobic wastewater treatment the electrochemical iron strategy can generate multiple benefits for wastewater management including increased removal efficiencies for total and volatile suspended solids chemical oxygen demand and phosphorus the rate of methane production also increased with electrochemically produced iron economic analysis revealed the viability of electrochemical iron with total cost reduced by one quarter to a third compared with using fecl3 these benefits indicate that electrochemical iron dosing can greatly enhance the overall operation and performance of anaerobic membrane processes and this particularly facilitates wastewater management in a decentralized scenario graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical iron dosing sulfide control anaerobic wastewater treatment membrane fouling control data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years energy recovery from domestic wastewater has focused on complete anaerobic treatment directly converting organic matter into methane ch4 an et al 2016 garfí et al 2017 li and yu 2016 vinardell et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a the anaerobic processes enable a wastewater treatment plant wwtp to transition from being a large energy consumer to a net energy generator mccarty et al 2011 wang et al 2022 coupled with a membrane unit the system can generate high quality effluent with low solid organic matter and pathogen concentrations smith et al 2014 szczuka et al 2021 the anaerobic membrane processes can assist safe production of reuse water in the next generation wwtp li and yu 2016 the anaerobic membrane processes combined with natural post treatment e g vegetated biofiltration have also been considered as a useful solution in a decentralized wastewater treatment scenario mccarty et al 2011 however there are still inherent issues related to the sustainability of anaerobic membrane processes firstly municipal sewage contains sulfate e g 5 10 mg s l resulting in anaerobic generation of hydrogen sulfide h2s along with ch4 leading to odour and safety concerns and corrosion of equipment vollertsen et al 2008 secondly membrane technology is prone to fouling issues guo et al 2012 stuckey 2012 meaning that membrane units have to be replaced more frequently hence increasing capital costs and more energy is consumed in order to maintain the unit at a consistent flux iron salts i e fecl3 are commonly used chemicals in wwtps which enable both sulfide control and mitigation of membrane fouling in anaerobic membrane processes lim et al 2019 meng et al 2017 dosed iron can precipitate with sulfide in wastewater liquor reducing h2s emission ganigue et al 2011 haaning nielsen et al 2005 iron salts may also coagulate bacterial cells thereby decreasing fouling on the membrane surface by improving sludge aggregation dong et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 despite these known benefits the use of iron chemicals is somewhat undesirable because concentrated iron salt solutions are corrosive with associated occupational health and safety concerns related to transport handling and on site storage werf 2007 addressing these issues is particularly important for decentralized wastewater treatment which is a flexible and sustainable mode of wastewater management designed to avoid long distance wastewater transportation and reduce the scale of the sewer network kobayashi et al 2020 leigh and lee 2019 in addition complete anaerobic treatment would require a high dosage of iron e g 60 mg fe l for conversion of all sulfate in the wastewater to sulfide and subsequent elimination such dosing significantly acidifies wastewater sludge calderon et al 2021 hu et al 2021 and likely results in process variation and instability therefore an alternative iron dosing strategy is needed for anaerobic membrane processes electrochemical production is a new method of generating iron chemicals applied in sewer systems for sulfide control lin et al 2017a lin et al 2017b pikaar et al 2019 potentially supported by solar power an on site electrochemical system with iron electrodes enables release of anodic dissolved iron species with cathodic hydroxyl anion production in contrast to using fecl3 the electrochemical approach does not decrease the sludge ph and avoids transport and storage safety issues these advantages suggest that electrochemical iron dosing would be preferable to fecl3 addition in anaerobic membrane processes it is also possible to bring additional benefit if iron can be produced in situ during anaerobic treatment here hydrogen h2 could be produced as the cathodic reaction with anodic iron oxidation and then combined with ch4 production and carbon dioxide co2 consumption via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis eq 1 1 c o 2 4 h 2 h

043 m2 was submerged inside the mft operation consisted of cycles of 25 min filtration followed by 5 min relaxation giving an average flux of 9 5 l m2 h lmh backwashing with the permeate was used to mitigate membrane fouling after day 258 specifically the permeate was backwashed for 1 min every 30 min by reversing the flow of the permeate pump at a flow rate 0 5 l h from then onwards each filtration cycle comprised 36 min including 25 min filtration 5 min relaxation 1 min backwash and 5 min relaxation throughout operation transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored using a pressure transducer and the data was automatically recorded dt80 data taker the membrane filtration process was manually interrupted when the tmp value reached 40 kpa at this stage membrane cleaning was carried out according to the standard procedure provided by the manufacturer i e the fouled membrane module was removed and immersed in a sodium hypochlorite solution 0 5 for 4 h followed by immersion in a citric acid solution 1 0 for 2 h at the same time sludge in the mfts were discharged 2 2 experimental design and monitoring procedures three systems were operated in parallel for about 350 days that was divided into two phases namely baseline and experimental phases the baseline operation day 0 164 aimed to achieve stable and consistent performances among the three systems hydraulic retention time hrt of the abrs was initially set as 3 days day 0 40 then shortened to 2 days day 41 90 and finally maintained at 1 day until the end of operation hrt of the mfts was half of that of abrs correspondingly the total hrt of the three systems were 4 5 days day 0 40 3 days day 41 90 and 1 5 days to the end biogas from the six compartments was collected using a gas bag 2 l for measurement of composition by gas chromatography and its production rate was recorded by a tipping bucket gas meter the gas meter was calibrated monthly in the experimental phase respective electrochemically generated iron was dosed into the r ferrous and r magnetite systems to investigate the impact on the performance of anaerobic membrane processes other operational conditions were maintained consistently iron dosage in both systems was controlled at 80 mg fe per litre treated wastewater according to the batch results data not shown for sulfide and phosphate removal 20 30 mg s l and 6 8 mg p l estimated in our previous studies from day 165 to day 350 ferrous iron was produced in situ in r ferrous via electrochemical oxidation of iron plates harding steel australia installed in the first compartment fig s2a iron plates with dimensions of 40 cm 3 cm 1 cm 960 g were used for both anode and cathode and were separated by 1 cm distance iron oxidation was achieved by maintaining a constant current of 32 ma via a bench power supply 72 2685 tenma china for r magnetite a magnetite nanoparticles mnps stock solution was dosed from day 184 the iron was externally prepared once a week according to the method previously described in literature lin et al 2017a in short a simple electrolysis cell was set up by placing two iron plates 15 cm 1 4 cm 0 3 cm in parallel in a glass beaker with an interelectrode distance of 0 4 cm and 2 g l nacl solution as electrolyte operation of the electrolysis cell at a high current of 100 ma produced 250 ml mnps with a concentration of 10 g fe l in 24 h a 5 ml solution of mnps was dosed into the inlet of r magnetite every 1 5 h using a timer controlled peristaltic pump fig s2b 2 3 membrane flux tests water flux tests were conducted on the virgin and fouled membranes after cleaning with 0 5 sodium hypochlorite solution followed by 1 0 citric acid solution sodium hypochlorite removed organics while citric acid removed inorganic contaminants membranes were placed in the mft that was filled with clean tap water then tap water was pumped through the membrane at flux values of 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 lmh each flux was performed for 10 min and the tmp was recorded at the end of every flux there was a 5 min relaxation between each flux the membrane resistance was determined through linear regression of the tmp and flux values from each clean water flux test the membrane resistance was quantified by darcy s law eq 2 using the linear regression of the flux values and the corresponding tmps 2 r δ p j μ

25 1500 mg l merck liquid samples were taken using a syringe and then filtered through disposable millipore filter units 0 22 μm millipore millex gp for the analysis of ammonium phosphate and sulfur species i e sulfide sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate ammonium and phosphate were analysed using a flow injection analyser lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin and sulfur species were measured by ion chromatography with an ultraviolet uv and conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 keller lehmann et al 2006 analysis of total and dissolved iron concentrations were conducted using inductive column plasma optical emission spectroscopy perkin elmer optima 7300dv waltham ma usa the ph was measured using a portable ph monitor and probe ph 5 oakton biogas ch4 co2 and h2 content was measured by gas chromatography 7890a agilent as described previously zhang et al 2019b biogas h2s content was measured according to rebosura et al 2018 abundance of faecal coliforms in influent effluent of abr and effluent of filtration of r control r ferrous and r magnetite were evaluated using the colilert 18 test kit idexx laboratories australia according to manufacturer instructions details of the economic analysis can be found in the supplementary materials the dissolved ch4 concentration was measured according to the methods detailed in literature guisasola et al 2008 in brief 5 ml liquid sample were harvested from the last chamber of each abr to a vacuumed 10 ml bd vacutainer tubes using a needle attached to a 5 ml plastic syringe to allow equilibration of gas and liquid phases the tubes were mixed in a shaker for 24 h at 100 rpm after that the ch4 concentration in the gas phase of the tubes was measured using a gas chromatography 7890a agilent zhang et al 2019b the concentration of ch4 in the initial liquid phase reactor was calculated using mass balance and henry s law 2 5 statistical analysis to identify significant difference between experimental and control systems a t test was conducted in microsoft excel if the p value is below 0 05 it means the difference is significant and vice versa 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline abr operation three abrs were inoculated with anaerobically digested sludge and continuously fed with real municipal wastewater with a 3 day hrt in the first 40 days the effluent cod concentrations rapidly stabilized at slightly above 200 mg l giving average cod removal efficiencies of about 50 the hrt was then shortened to 2 days from day 41 and finally kept constant at 1 day from day 91 onwards with the shorter hrt effluent cod concentrations transiently increased then gradually decreased to 250 mg l from day 104 164 the effluent cod concentrations were similar in the effluent of the three abrs with 251 4 13 2 mg cod l in r control 256 1 18 5 mg cod l in r ferrous and 259 6 12 5 mg cod l in r magnetite the difference among them was not significant p 0 05 during baseline operation there was no significant difference for effluent tss sulfate sulfide ammonium and phosphorus concentrations and methane production rates for r control r ferrous and r magnetite as summarized in table s1 together these results showed almost identical performance among the three abrs during baseline operation 3 2 effect of electrochemical iron dosing on abr performance 3 2 1 tss removal with continuous operation of 200 days tss concentration in the abr effluent was 50 mg tss l less than half that of the influent 110 7 3 9 mg tss l after day 220 the influent tss concentration of the three abrs was increased to 308 5 6 7 mg tss l despite 3x increase in influent concentration effluent tss concentrations did not increase and were almost unchanged fig 1 a moreover measurement of tss concentration from the outlet of each of the six compartments showed that tss was primarily removed in the front four compartments fig 2 a combined these results indicated that the abr baffling configuration was effective in retaining solids li et al 2016 from day 221 350 the average effluent tss concentrations were 43 9 2 7 mg tss l in r ferrous and 44 1 2 3 mg tss l in r magnetite both were lower than the average level of 58 4 2 4 mg tss l in r control the effluent of r ferrous and r magnetite also had lower vss concentrations 21 6 2 3 and 23 5 2 8 mg vss l respectively than that of r control 43 9 2 9 mg vss l these comparisons indicated that electrochemical iron dosing enhanced solids removal in the anaerobic treatment system the enhanced tss and vss removals were mostly related to improved cod removal performance which is discussed below it is worth noting that the effluent iron concentrations were 6 8 0 5 mg l in r ferrous and 5 7 0 5 mg l in r magnetite table 2 the iron which likely consisted of ferrous sulfide fes and vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o salehin et al 2020 only contributed to 15 of total solids in the abr effluent 3 2 2 cod conversion to ch4 electrochemical iron dosing commenced from day 165 in r ferrous and day 184 in r magnetite the effluent cod concentrations of the two experimental systems were lower than that of r control effluent fig 1b with values averaging 131 8 6 1 155 3 5 7 and 177 3 6 1 mg cod l respectively during six months continuous operation day 184 350 the differences between the experimental abrs and the control reactor were statistically significant p 0 05 indicating that electrochemical iron dosing enhanced cod removal relatively low levels of cod in the effluent were maintained in all three systems when the influent tcod concentration was increased to 674 6 13 1 mg cod l and the influent cod loading reached 0 8 kg cod m3 d from day 220 fig 1b and table s2 the analyses of tcod and scod concentrations in the outlet of each compartment showed that cod was gradually removed from wastewater flowing into these compartments fig 2b and c in the experimental phase the ch4 production rates of r ferrous and r magnetite were higher than that of the control reactor fig 1c from day 280 350 the average ch4 production rate was 1514 18 ml ch4 d in r ferrous and 1329 11 ml ch4 d in r magnetite showing a relative increase of 21 3 and 6 1 respectively compared to that in r control 1248 10 ml ch4 d a calculation based analysis was carried out to understand why r ferrous produced more ch4 than the other reactors table s3 the cod removal rate of r ferrous and r magnetite increased by approximately 550 mg and 220 mg cod per day respectively compared to r control the more cod removed can theoretically increase the daily ch4 production rate by 193 ml in r ferrous and 77 ml in r magnetite the increased ch4 is equal to the measure in r magnetite yet is lower than that of 266 ml ch4 day in r ferrous the results indicated that the in situ generated h2 in r ferrous could be further converted to ch4 via the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway described in eq 1 according to the iron dosage i e 80 mg fe l the calculated h2 production rate was 349 ml day the measured h2 content was 2 3 0 6 in the biogas of r ferrous and undetectable in the biogas of r control and r magnetite table 2 giving the amount of h2 utilized by hydrogenotrophic methanogens likely to be 299 ml day i e 85 of total h2 production this amount of h2 would theoretically generate 75 ml ch4 day combined with 193 ml ch4 generated via cod removal the predicted extra production was 268 ml ch4 day very close to the measured value of 266 ml ch4 day although the calculation can support h2 consumption by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis it still requires further validation using specific methanogenic activity tests in future studies the ch4 content in the biogas of r control r ferrous and r magnetite was 75 3 2 1 84 8 3 2 and 78 6 3 1 respectively table 2 the higher ch4 content in r ferrous and r magnetite was related to the hydroxide ion oh generated in the electrochemical process fig s2 hydroxide generation caused a higher ph value in r ferrous and r magnetite 7 5 0 1 than that in the control reactor 7 3 0 1 resulting in more co2 retained in the liquid phase of experimental reactors table 2 and fig s3 the high ch4 content in r ferrous was also likely due to biological co2 scavenging i e hydrogenotrophic methanogens used h2 generated at the cathode to reduce co2 to ch4 analysis of cod mass balance was carried out during steady state operation day 280 350 and the results are presented in fig s4 the effluent cod residuals without ch4 and dissolved sulfide accounted for about 23 of the inflow cod in r control and 22 in r magnetite in contrast r ferrous had the lowest percentage 17 in the effluent and highest cod removal efficiency among the three systems most of the influent cod 70 was converted into ch4 and was present in both liquid and gas phases specifically 57 63 and 59 of the influent cod was converted to ch4 in the biogas of r control r ferrous and r magnetite respectively the percentage of dissolved ch4 in the liquid effluent was similar i e 11 12 in the three abrs 3 2 3 sulfide and h2s control fig 3 compares dissolved sulfate and sulfide concentrations in the effluent with h2s content in the biogas among the three abrs throughout operation there was little change in the influent sulfate 8 1 0 2 mg s l fig 3a and sulfide 7 8 0 3 mg s l fig 3b in r control the average sulfate concentration in the effluent decreased to 0 2 0 1 mg s l with concomitant increase in sulfide concentration to 15 7 0 4 mg s l the near complete reduction of sulfate to sulfide during anaerobic treatment led to a high h2s content 1170 5 33 1 ppmv in the biogas of r control fig 3c the sulfide concentration in the effluent was substantially decreased in r ferrous and r magnetite with average sulfide concentrations of 1 7 0 1 mg s l and 2 4 0 1 mg s l respectively from day 184 to 350 sulfide reduction mainly occurred in the first compartment of the baffled abr fig 2d as a result the h2s content dropped to 147 2 10 8 ppmv in the biogas of r ferrous and 205 0 6 0 ppmv in the biogas of r magnetite a relative decrease of 88 7 0 8 and 83 5 1 0 respectively in comparison to that of r control these results demonstrated that electrochemical iron dosing was effective in reducing sulfide and h2s in anaerobic wastewater treatment 3 2 4 nitrogen and phosphorus removal for r control the ammonium and phosphate concentrations in the effluent were slightly higher than those in the influent fig 4 a and b this phenomenon was likely due to the hydrolysis of organic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds to ammonium and phosphate ions both of which cannot be removed by the anaerobic process the use of electrochemical iron dosing did not change ammonium removal but significantly enhanced phosphorus removal the average phosphate concentrations in the effluent of r ferrous and r magnetite decreased to 1 6 0 1 and 2 3 0 1 mg p l respectively in comparison to 7 1 0 2 mg p l in the effluent of r control total phosphorus concentration in the effluent was also dramatically decreased by dosing iron electrochemically table 2 3 3 effect of electrochemical iron dosing on mft performance 3 3 1 effluent quality each anaerobic abr decreased faecal coliforms in the raw wastewater 6 1 0 5 106 mpn l by about one order of magnitude the difference between r control and the two experimental abrs was not statistically significant p 0 05 suggesting that iron dosing would not further improve the removal of faecal coliforms however the faecal coliform level in the mft effluent was reduced to below the limit of detection 200 mpn l fig 5 this result confirms that the used membrane filtration can substantially control pathogens enabling safe production of reuse water in addition the mfts decreased tss 1 mg tss l for all and cod concentrations i e 142 3 4 3 mg cod l in r control 97 8 2 9 mg cod l in r ferrous and 120 6 3 8 mg cod l in r magnetite 3 3 2 membrane fouling mitigation fig 6 shows the change in tmp during continuous operation of the three downstream mfts the membrane filtration modules were operated at a constant flux of 9 5 lmh within the typical range of 5 12 lmh applied to anaerobic membrane processes for treating domestic wastewater gao et al 2014 huang et al 2013 smith et al 2013 the three mfts exhibited similar tmp profiles increasing from 5 kpa to 40 kpa in approximately one month the fouled membrane modules were cleaned using citric acid and sodium hypochlorite which decreased the tmp to 5 kpa at this baseline stage the three mfts were operated under similar conditions the membrane fouling development and mitigation cycles were then tested in the experimental phase from day 184 to 257 the average time for tmp to increase from 5 kpa to 40 kpa was 12 2 0 2 days in r control n 5 which was shorter than 14 1 0 2 days n 5 in r ferrous and 13 6 0 1 days n 4 in r magnetite the results indicated that electrochemical iron dosing slowed membrane fouling from day 258 intermittent backwashing was applied to further mitigate fouling of the three mfts the strategy prolonged the typical membrane operating period to 22 5 2 0 days in r control n 3 while significantly prolonging the period to 28 7 3 1 days in r ferrous n 3 and 27 1 2 3 days in r magnetite n 3 the results also demonstrated that electrochemical iron dosing increases the effectiveness of backwashing on mitigating fouling to determine potential mechanisms related to mitigation of membrane fouling a group of water flux tests were conducted on the fouled membrane modules collected from each reactor mft tests were carried out on fouled membrane membrane cleaned by sodium hypochlorite membrane cleaned by citric acid and membrane cleaned with those chemicals in sequence the resultant data i e the slope of tmp increase versus flux r 2 0 99 see fig 7 a identified resistance due to fouling by composition i e organic versus inorganic substances wang et al 2014 r magnetite and r ferrous had lower total resistance than r control consistent with the tmp results obtained in the continuous operation fig 6 specifically the resistance due to organics rnaocl was 0 86 tmp lmh in r control contributing to 51 2 of total resistance this suggests that organic substances were the main cause for membrane fouling the rnaocl level decreased to 0 37 tmp lmh in r magnetite and r ferrous likely due to the lower effluent cod concentrations than that of r control table 2 in contrast the resistance due to inorganics rca almost doubled in the two iron dosed systems likely due to the residual iron in the effluent of abrs table 2 the resistance that cannot be removed by citric acid and sodium hypochlorite i e rir contributed to 15 5 total r control resistance in comparison rir substantially decreased in both r ferrous 4 1 and r magnetite 3 1 however the reason for reduction in rir remains unclear and requires further study 3 4 dosing of electrochemical iron greatly enhances anaerobic treatment of wastewater iron salts i e fecl3 are used in centralized wwtps because iron dosing can provide multiple benefits including sulfide control enhanced cod and phosphorus removal as well as membrane fouling mitigation calderon et al 2021 dong et al 2015 firer et al 2008 ge et al 2013 gutierrez et al 2010 hu et al 2021 kulandaivelu et al 2020 nielsen et al 2008 rebosura et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 however concentrated iron salt solutions are highly corrosive and pose safety issues for transport and storage here this study carried out a comprehensive assessment of the gas and liquid phases and membrane component of anaerobic processes with or without electrochemical iron dosing during long term operation the results demonstrated that addition of iron generated electrochemically either in situ or ex situ achieved higher tss vss and cod removal efficiencies lower sulfide and phosphorus concentrations in the effluent lower h2s content in the biogas and less membrane fouling than the reactor without iron dosing together these results demonstrate the feasibility of using electrochemically produced iron to generate multifaceted benefits in anaerobic wastewater treatment previous studies have reported that electrochemical iron dosing can effectively mitigate h2s emission in sewers lin et al 2017b pikaar et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the average sulfide removal efficiency in these previous studies was 76 4 95 4 these results are comparable to the relative decrease of sulfide by 83 5 88 7 achieved in this study the anaerobic treatment of wastewater often combines with membrane technology to control pathogenic organisms while use of the membrane is prone to fouling dong et al 2015 in this study organic substances were found to be the main cause for membrane resistance consistent to previous studies on anaerobic membrane processes gao et al 2013 huang et al 2011 wang and waite 2009 wu et al 2008 the dosing of electrochemical iron showed the enhanced removal of cod fig 1b and consequently the membrane resistance caused by organic substances was decreased fig 7b the fouling mitigation likely related to changed properties of mixed liquor that include soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps the organic smp and eps can accumulate to the surface of membrane and block membrane as their molecular sizes are comparable to or even smaller than the membrane pore dong et al 2015 drews et al 2007 metzger et al 2007 wang and waite 2008 zhang et al 2015 the other potential reason is that dosing of iron salts could increase particles size and enhance coagulative characteristics favourable to fouling control song et al 2008 waite et al 1999 zhang et al 2008 further the developed anaerobic membrane processes applied the total hrt of 1 5 days which is relatively long compared to the typical hrt i e 8 24 hours used for anaerobic membrane processes in previous studies smith et al 2012 this agrees with the purpose of the developed process here that could be more considered as a useful solution in a decentralized wastewater treatment scenario where system footprint is usually not a major issue in addition to performance evaluation the cost of electrochemical iron dosing was also evaluated and compared with direct dosing of iron salts as the main cost the electricity consumption of electrochemical iron dosing was estimated based on current and voltage data during long term operation for r ferrous the current was 32 ma and the voltage varied between 0 6 and 1 0 v fig s5 for r magnetite the iron was produced externally with a high current of 100 ma and high voltage of about 2 0 v combined with costs for materials the total cost for the in situ and ex situ electrochemical generation of iron was 116 5 aud ml and 131 5 aud ml wastewater respectively this represents a reduction of 24 4 33 1 compared to using conventional iron salts i e 173 9 aud ml wastewater assuming 40 w w fecl3 see details in table s4 the results suggest that electrochemical iron dosing is more cost effective than dosing with iron salts moreover the comparison of electrochemical strategies showed that r ferrous generated in situ demonstrated better overall performance in terms of all tested parameters than ex situ production of r magnetite in particular the ch4 content in the biogas from r ferrous dosing increased up to 84 8 3 2 attributed to in situ h2 production and subsequent conversion to ch4 table 2 at the same time co2 content in the biogas was as low as 13 1 2 1 due to co2 consumption during h2 conversion table 2 the results demonstrate potential for upgrading biogas to renewable natural gas i e biomethane with high ch4 and low co2 content 3 5 future research during one year of system operation under anaerobic conditions the biomass yield was low consequently no excess sludge was discharged from the three abrs except for sludge sampling however the continuous dosing of iron caused significant accumulation in the sludge and 90 of the dosed iron was retained in the experimental reactors table 2 as such with longer term operation iron species will dominate the solids in discharged excess sludge the opportunity to recover iron from the iron rich sludge requires further study moreover the present study tested an iron dosage of 80 mg fe l based on sulfide control and more investigation is needed to determine the optimal iron dosage local electrochemical generation of iron is particularly suited to a decentralized wastewater treatment plant and when combined with solar power supply it presents a cost effective and sustainable solution however despite removing most nutrients ammonium remains in the effluent after anaerobic membrane treatment thus a downstream polishing step such as vegetated biofiltration is recommended having the advantages of efficient nutrient removal small footprint and pleasant environmental aesthetics bakheet et al 2020 prodanovic et al 2017 zinger et al 2021 following biofiltration the water can be reused for landscaping urban farming and toilet flushing li et al 2009 a multicriteria analysis is warranted to assess the overall process and performance in achieving multiple aims such as low energy requirement low sludge production high energy recovery and improved water reuse 4 conclusion this study carried out a comprehensive laboratory assessment of iron dosing on anaerobic membrane processes using in situ and ex situ electrochemical iron production dosing with electrochemical iron resulted in multiple benefits such as increased tss and cod removal increased ch4 production decreased sulfide and phosphorus concentrations in effluent decreased h2s content in biogas and decreased membrane fouling although the benefits are comparable to those of dosing iron salts an inherent advantage is that electrochemically produced iron can alleviate safety concerns associated with transport and handling of corrosive concentrated iron salt solutions and avoid the issues associated with the ph decrease caused by fecl3 addition further in situ iron production was found to be preferable to ex situ generating higher ch4 with lower co2 content in the biogas overall this study demonstrates that dosing with electrochemical iron is a feasible strategy for improving wastewater management declaration

15487,although iron salts such as iron iii chloride fecl3 have widespread application in wastewater treatment safety concerns limit their use due to the corrosive nature of concentrated solutions this study demonstrates that local electrochemical generation of iron is a viable alternative to the use of iron salts three laboratory systems with anaerobic membrane processes were set up to treat real wastewater two systems used the production of either in situ or ex situ electrochemical iron as fe2 and fe2 fe3 2o4 respectively while the other system served as a control these systems were operated for over one year to assess the impact of electrochemically produced iron on system performance the results showed that dosing of electrochemical iron significantly reduced sulfide concentration in effluent and hydrogen sulfide content in biogas and mitigated organics based membrane fouling all of which are critical issues inherently related to sustainability of anaerobic wastewater treatment the electrochemical iron strategy can generate multiple benefits for wastewater management including increased removal efficiencies for total and volatile suspended solids chemical oxygen demand and phosphorus the rate of methane production also increased with electrochemically produced iron economic analysis revealed the viability of electrochemical iron with total cost reduced by one quarter to a third compared with using fecl3 these benefits indicate that electrochemical iron dosing can greatly enhance the overall operation and performance of anaerobic membrane processes and this particularly facilitates wastewater management in a decentralized scenario graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical iron dosing sulfide control anaerobic wastewater treatment membrane fouling control data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years energy recovery from domestic wastewater has focused on complete anaerobic treatment directly converting organic matter into methane ch4 an et al 2016 garfí et al 2017 li and yu 2016 vinardell et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a the anaerobic processes enable a wastewater treatment plant wwtp to transition from being a large energy consumer to a net energy generator mccarty et al 2011 wang et al 2022 coupled with a membrane unit the system can generate high quality effluent with low solid organic matter and pathogen concentrations smith et al 2014 szczuka et al 2021 the anaerobic membrane processes can assist safe production of reuse water in the next generation wwtp li and yu 2016 the anaerobic membrane processes combined with natural post treatment e g vegetated biofiltration have also been considered as a useful solution in a decentralized wastewater treatment scenario mccarty et al 2011 however there are still inherent issues related to the sustainability of anaerobic membrane processes firstly municipal sewage contains sulfate e g 5 10 mg s l resulting in anaerobic generation of hydrogen sulfide h2s along with ch4 leading to odour and safety concerns and corrosion of equipment vollertsen et al 2008 secondly membrane technology is prone to fouling issues guo et al 2012 stuckey 2012 meaning that membrane units have to be replaced more frequently hence increasing capital costs and more energy is consumed in order to maintain the unit at a consistent flux iron salts i e fecl3 are commonly used chemicals in wwtps which enable both sulfide control and mitigation of membrane fouling in anaerobic membrane processes lim et al 2019 meng et al 2017 dosed iron can precipitate with sulfide in wastewater liquor reducing h2s emission ganigue et al 2011 haaning nielsen et al 2005 iron salts may also coagulate bacterial cells thereby decreasing fouling on the membrane surface by improving sludge aggregation dong et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 despite these known benefits the use of iron chemicals is somewhat undesirable because concentrated iron salt solutions are corrosive with associated occupational health and safety concerns related to transport handling and on site storage werf 2007 addressing these issues is particularly important for decentralized wastewater treatment which is a flexible and sustainable mode of wastewater management designed to avoid long distance wastewater transportation and reduce the scale of the sewer network kobayashi et al 2020 leigh and lee 2019 in addition complete anaerobic treatment would require a high dosage of iron e g 60 mg fe l for conversion of all sulfate in the wastewater to sulfide and subsequent elimination such dosing significantly acidifies wastewater sludge calderon et al 2021 hu et al 2021 and likely results in process variation and instability therefore an alternative iron dosing strategy is needed for anaerobic membrane processes electrochemical production is a new method of generating iron chemicals applied in sewer systems for sulfide control lin et al 2017a lin et al 2017b pikaar et al 2019 potentially supported by solar power an on site electrochemical system with iron electrodes enables release of anodic dissolved iron species with cathodic hydroxyl anion production in contrast to using fecl3 the electrochemical approach does not decrease the sludge ph and avoids transport and storage safety issues these advantages suggest that electrochemical iron dosing would be preferable to fecl3 addition in anaerobic membrane processes it is also possible to bring additional benefit if iron can be produced in situ during anaerobic treatment here hydrogen h2 could be produced as the cathodic reaction with anodic iron oxidation and then combined with ch4 production and carbon dioxide co2 consumption via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis eq 1 1 c o 2 4 h 2 h y d r o g e n o t r o p h i c m e t h a n o g e n s c h 4 2 h 2 o the aim of this study is to assess the impacts and benefits of electrochemical iron dosing on anaerobic membrane processes for the complete treatment of domestic wastewater three laboratory scale anaerobic membrane treatment systems were designed including an experimental system with in situ electrochemical iron production an experimental system with ex situ electrochemically produced iron and a control system without iron dosing the overall operation included a baseline period followed by an experimental phase effluent concentrations of total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss total and soluble chemical oxygen demand tcod and scod dissolved sulfur species phosphorus and faecal coliform levels biogas production and composition and membrane fouling performance were monitored and compared over the course of one year economic analysis was also conducted to estimate the cost of using iron in various scenarios 2 material and methods 2 1 set up and operation of anaerobic baffled reactors and membrane filtration tanks three lab scale treatment systems i e r control r ferrous and r magnetite were established without in situ with in situ and with ex situ electrochemical iron dosing respectively further details in section 2 2 each system consisted of an anaerobic baffled reactor abr followed by a membrane filtration tank mft as illustrated in fig s1 the abr was made of polymethyl methacrylate with a height of 450 mm and an inner diameter of 200 mm giving a total volume of 12 l 10 l working volume and 2 l headspace each abr had six duplicate compartments all of which were gas tight sealed and covered with aluminium foil to prevent light exposure initially 2 l of digested sludge collected from a local wwtp full scale anaerobic digester brisbane australia was divided into six equal parts and inoculated into the six respective compartments detailed characterization of the digested sludge can be found in our previous study calderon et al 2021 real wastewater was continuously fed into abrs by using peristaltic pumps bt100 2j longer china and the effluent of abrs then connected to mfts the used municipal wastewater was collected fortnightly from an urban pumping station located at st lucia queensland australia the wastewater was then held in an 800 l tank in a cold room at 4 c in order to prevent change in wastewater characteristics from day 220 the wastewater in storage was mixed with a submerged pump that was operating intermittently at an on off ratio of 30 60 mins the wastewater was warmed to room temperature 22 1 c using a heater before being fed to the abrs table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the influent wastewater used in this study the mft with a working volume of 5 l was made of polymethyl methacrylate a module with a polyvinylidene fluoride flat sheet membrane pore size 0 22 μm shanshui shengyuan china and total effective membrane area of 0 043 m2 was submerged inside the mft operation consisted of cycles of 25 min filtration followed by 5 min relaxation giving an average flux of 9 5 l m2 h lmh backwashing with the permeate was used to mitigate membrane fouling after day 258 specifically the permeate was backwashed for 1 min every 30 min by reversing the flow of the permeate pump at a flow rate 0 5 l h from then onwards each filtration cycle comprised 36 min including 25 min filtration 5 min relaxation 1 min backwash and 5 min relaxation throughout operation transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored using a pressure transducer and the data was automatically recorded dt80 data taker the membrane filtration process was manually interrupted when the tmp value reached 40 kpa at this stage membrane cleaning was carried out according to the standard procedure provided by the manufacturer i e the fouled membrane module was removed and immersed in a sodium hypochlorite solution 0 5 for 4 h followed by immersion in a citric acid solution 1 0 for 2 h at the same time sludge in the mfts were discharged 2 2 experimental design and monitoring procedures three systems were operated in parallel for about 350 days that was divided into two phases namely baseline and experimental phases the baseline operation day 0 164 aimed to achieve stable and consistent performances among the three systems hydraulic retention time hrt of the abrs was initially set as 3 days day 0 40 then shortened to 2 days day 41 90 and finally maintained at 1 day until the end of operation hrt of the mfts was half of that of abrs correspondingly the total hrt of the three systems were 4 5 days day 0 40 3 days day 41 90 and 1 5 days to the end biogas from the six compartments was collected using a gas bag 2 l for measurement of composition by gas chromatography and its production rate was recorded by a tipping bucket gas meter the gas meter was calibrated monthly in the experimental phase respective electrochemically generated iron was dosed into the r ferrous and r magnetite systems to investigate the impact on the performance of anaerobic membrane processes other operational conditions were maintained consistently iron dosage in both systems was controlled at 80 mg fe per litre treated wastewater according to the batch results data not shown for sulfide and phosphate removal 20 30 mg s l and 6 8 mg p l estimated in our previous studies from day 165 to day 350 ferrous iron was produced in situ in r ferrous via electrochemical oxidation of iron plates harding steel australia installed in the first compartment fig s2a iron plates with dimensions of 40 cm 3 cm 1 cm 960 g were used for both anode and cathode and were separated by 1 cm distance iron oxidation was achieved by maintaining a constant current of 32 ma via a bench power supply 72 2685 tenma china for r magnetite a magnetite nanoparticles mnps stock solution was dosed from day 184 the iron was externally prepared once a week according to the method previously described in literature lin et al 2017a in short a simple electrolysis cell was set up by placing two iron plates 15 cm 1 4 cm 0 3 cm in parallel in a glass beaker with an interelectrode distance of 0 4 cm and 2 g l nacl solution as electrolyte operation of the electrolysis cell at a high current of 100 ma produced 250 ml mnps with a concentration of 10 g fe l in 24 h a 5 ml solution of mnps was dosed into the inlet of r magnetite every 1 5 h using a timer controlled peristaltic pump fig s2b 2 3 membrane flux tests water flux tests were conducted on the virgin and fouled membranes after cleaning with 0 5 sodium hypochlorite solution followed by 1 0 citric acid solution sodium hypochlorite removed organics while citric acid removed inorganic contaminants membranes were placed in the mft that was filled with clean tap water then tap water was pumped through the membrane at flux values of 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 lmh each flux was performed for 10 min and the tmp was recorded at the end of every flux there was a 5 min relaxation between each flux the membrane resistance was determined through linear regression of the tmp and flux values from each clean water flux test the membrane resistance was quantified by darcy s law eq 2 using the linear regression of the flux values and the corresponding tmps 2 r δ p j μ

25 1500 mg l merck liquid samples were taken using a syringe and then filtered through disposable millipore filter units 0 22 μm millipore millex gp for the analysis of ammonium phosphate and sulfur species i e sulfide sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate ammonium and phosphate were analysed using a flow injection analyser lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin and sulfur species were measured by ion chromatography with an ultraviolet uv and conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 keller lehmann et al 2006 analysis of total and dissolved iron concentrations were conducted using inductive column plasma optical emission spectroscopy perkin elmer optima 7300dv waltham ma usa the ph was measured using a portable ph monitor and probe ph 5 oakton biogas ch4 co2 and h2 content was measured by gas chromatography 7890a agilent as described previously zhang et al 2019b biogas h2s content was measured according to rebosura et al 2018 abundance of faecal coliforms in influent effluent of abr and effluent of filtration of r control r ferrous and r magnetite were evaluated using the colilert 18 test kit idexx laboratories australia according to manufacturer instructions details of the economic analysis can be found in the supplementary materials the dissolved ch4 concentration was measured according to the methods detailed in literature guisasola et al 2008 in brief 5 ml liquid sample were harvested from the last chamber of each abr to a vacuumed 10 ml bd vacutainer tubes using a needle attached to a 5 ml plastic syringe to allow equilibration of gas and liquid phases the tubes were mixed in a shaker for 24 h at 100 rpm after that the ch4 concentration in the gas phase of the tubes was measured using a gas chromatography 7890a agilent zhang et al 2019b the concentration of ch4 in the initial liquid phase reactor was calculated using mass balance and henry s law 2 5 statistical analysis to identify significant difference between experimental and control systems a t test was conducted in microsoft excel if the p value is below 0 05 it means the difference is significant and vice versa 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline abr operation three abrs were inoculated with anaerobically digested sludge and continuously fed with real municipal wastewater with a 3 day hrt in the first 40 days the effluent cod concentrations rapidly stabilized at slightly above 200 mg l giving average cod removal efficiencies of about 50 the hrt was then shortened to 2 days from day 41 and finally kept constant at 1 day from day 91 onwards with the shorter hrt effluent cod concentrations transiently increased then gradually decreased to 250 mg l from day 104 164 the effluent cod concentrations were similar in the effluent of the three abrs with 251 4 13 2 mg cod l in r control 256 1 18 5 mg cod l in r ferrous and 259 6 12 5 mg cod l in r magnetite the difference among them was not significant p 0 05 during baseline operation there was no significant difference for effluent tss sulfate sulfide ammonium and phosphorus concentrations and methane production rates for r control r ferrous and r magnetite as summarized in table s1 together these results showed almost identical performance among the three abrs during baseline operation 3 2 effect of electrochemical iron dosing on abr performance 3 2 1 tss removal with continuous operation of 200 days tss concentration in the abr effluent was 50 mg tss l less than half that of the influent 110 7 3 9 mg tss l after day 220 the influent tss concentration of the three abrs was increased to 308 5 6 7 mg tss l despite 3x increase in influent concentration effluent tss concentrations did not increase and were almost unchanged fig 1 a moreover measurement of tss concentration from the outlet of each of the six compartments showed that tss was primarily removed in the front four compartments fig 2 a combined these results indicated that the abr baffling configuration was effective in retaining solids li et al 2016 from day 221 350 the average effluent tss concentrations were 43 9 2 7 mg tss l in r ferrous and 44 1 2 3 mg tss l in r magnetite both were lower than the average level of 58 4 2 4 mg tss l in r control the effluent of r ferrous and r magnetite also had lower vss concentrations 21 6 2 3 and 23 5 2 8 mg vss l respectively than that of r control 43 9 2 9 mg vss l these comparisons indicated that electrochemical iron dosing enhanced solids removal in the anaerobic treatment system the enhanced tss and vss removals were mostly related to improved cod removal performance which is discussed below it is worth noting that the effluent iron concentrations were 6 8 0 5 mg l in r ferrous and 5 7 0 5 mg l in r magnetite table 2 the iron which likely consisted of ferrous sulfide fes and vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o salehin et al 2020 only contributed to 15 of total solids in the abr effluent 3 2 2 cod conversion to ch4 electrochemical iron dosing commenced from day 165 in r ferrous and day 184 in r magnetite the effluent cod concentrations of the two experimental systems were lower than that of r control effluent fig 1b with values averaging 131 8 6 1 155 3 5 7 and 177 3 6 1 mg cod l respectively during six months continuous operation day 184 350 the differences between the experimental abrs and the control reactor were statistically significant p 0 05 indicating that electrochemical iron dosing enhanced cod removal relatively low levels of cod in the effluent were maintained in all three systems when the influent tcod concentration was increased to 674 6 13 1 mg cod l and the influent cod loading reached 0 8 kg cod m3 d from day 220 fig 1b and table s2 the analyses of tcod and scod concentrations in the outlet of each compartment showed that cod was gradually removed from wastewater flowing into these compartments fig 2b and c in the experimental phase the ch4 production rates of r ferrous and r magnetite were higher than that of the control reactor fig 1c from day 280 350 the average ch4 production rate was 1514 18 ml ch4 d in r ferrous and 1329 11 ml ch4 d in r magnetite showing a relative increase of 21 3 and 6 1 respectively compared to that in r control 1248 10 ml ch4 d a calculation based analysis was carried out to understand why r ferrous produced more ch4 than the other reactors table s3 the cod removal rate of r ferrous and r magnetite increased by approximately 550 mg and 220 mg cod per day respectively compared to r control the more cod removed can theoretically increase the daily ch4 production rate by 193 ml in r ferrous and 77 ml in r magnetite the increased ch4 is equal to the measure in r magnetite yet is lower than that of 266 ml ch4 day in r ferrous the results indicated that the in situ generated h2 in r ferrous could be further converted to ch4 via the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway described in eq 1 according to the iron dosage i e 80 mg fe l the calculated h2 production rate was 349 ml day the measured h2 content was 2 3 0 6 in the biogas of r ferrous and undetectable in the biogas of r control and r magnetite table 2 giving the amount of h2 utilized by hydrogenotrophic methanogens likely to be 299 ml day i e 85 of total h2 production this amount of h2 would theoretically generate 75 ml ch4 day combined with 193 ml ch4 generated via cod removal the predicted extra production was 268 ml ch4 day very close to the measured value of 266 ml ch4 day although the calculation can support h2 consumption by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis it still requires further validation using specific methanogenic activity tests in future studies the ch4 content in the biogas of r control r ferrous and r magnetite was 75 3 2 1 84 8 3 2 and 78 6 3 1 respectively table 2 the higher ch4 content in r ferrous and r magnetite was related to the hydroxide ion oh generated in the electrochemical process fig s2 hydroxide generation caused a higher ph value in r ferrous and r magnetite 7 5 0 1 than that in the control reactor 7 3 0 1 resulting in more co2 retained in the liquid phase of experimental reactors table 2 and fig s3 the high ch4 content in r ferrous was also likely due to biological co2 scavenging i e hydrogenotrophic methanogens used h2 generated at the cathode to reduce co2 to ch4 analysis of cod mass balance was carried out during steady state operation day 280 350 and the results are presented in fig s4 the effluent cod residuals without ch4 and dissolved sulfide accounted for about 23 of the inflow cod in r control and 22 in r magnetite in contrast r ferrous had the lowest percentage 17 in the effluent and highest cod removal efficiency among the three systems most of the influent cod 70 was converted into ch4 and was present in both liquid and gas phases specifically 57 63 and 59 of the influent cod was converted to ch4 in the biogas of r control r ferrous and r magnetite respectively the percentage of dissolved ch4 in the liquid effluent was similar i e 11 12 in the three abrs 3 2 3 sulfide and h2s control fig 3 compares dissolved sulfate and sulfide concentrations in the effluent with h2s content in the biogas among the three abrs throughout operation there was little change in the influent sulfate 8 1 0 2 mg s l fig 3a and sulfide 7 8 0 3 mg s l fig 3b in r control the average sulfate concentration in the effluent decreased to 0 2 0 1 mg s l with concomitant increase in sulfide concentration to 15 7 0 4 mg s l the near complete reduction of sulfate to sulfide during anaerobic treatment led to a high h2s content 1170 5 33 1 ppmv in the biogas of r control fig 3c the sulfide concentration in the effluent was substantially decreased in r ferrous and r magnetite with average sulfide concentrations of 1 7 0 1 mg s l and 2 4 0 1 mg s l respectively from day 184 to 350 sulfide reduction mainly occurred in the first compartment of the baffled abr fig 2d as a result the h2s content dropped to 147 2 10 8 ppmv in the biogas of r ferrous and 205 0 6 0 ppmv in the biogas of r magnetite a relative decrease of 88 7 0 8 and 83 5 1 0 respectively in comparison to that of r control these results demonstrated that electrochemical iron dosing was effective in reducing sulfide and h2s in anaerobic wastewater treatment 3 2 4 nitrogen and phosphorus removal for r control the ammonium and phosphate concentrations in the effluent were slightly higher than those in the influent fig 4 a and b this phenomenon was likely due to the hydrolysis of organic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds to ammonium and phosphate ions both of which cannot be removed by the anaerobic process the use of electrochemical iron dosing did not change ammonium removal but significantly enhanced phosphorus removal the average phosphate concentrations in the effluent of r ferrous and r magnetite decreased to 1 6 0 1 and 2 3 0 1 mg p l respectively in comparison to 7 1 0 2 mg p l in the effluent of r control total phosphorus concentration in the effluent was also dramatically decreased by dosing iron electrochemically table 2 3 3 effect of electrochemical iron dosing on mft performance 3 3 1 effluent quality each anaerobic abr decreased faecal coliforms in the raw wastewater 6 1 0 5 106 mpn l by about one order of magnitude the difference between r control and the two experimental abrs was not statistically significant p 0 05 suggesting that iron dosing would not further improve the removal of faecal coliforms however the faecal coliform level in the mft effluent was reduced to below the limit of detection 200 mpn l fig 5 this result confirms that the used membrane filtration can substantially control pathogens enabling safe production of reuse water in addition the mfts decreased tss 1 mg tss l for all and cod concentrations i e 142 3 4 3 mg cod l in r control 97 8 2 9 mg cod l in r ferrous and 120 6 3 8 mg cod l in r magnetite 3 3 2 membrane fouling mitigation fig 6 shows the change in tmp during continuous operation of the three downstream mfts the membrane filtration modules were operated at a constant flux of 9 5 lmh within the typical range of 5 12 lmh applied to anaerobic membrane processes for treating domestic wastewater gao et al 2014 huang et al 2013 smith et al 2013 the three mfts exhibited similar tmp profiles increasing from 5 kpa to 40 kpa in approximately one month the fouled membrane modules were cleaned using citric acid and sodium hypochlorite which decreased the tmp to 5 kpa at this baseline stage the three mfts were operated under similar conditions the membrane fouling development and mitigation cycles were then tested in the experimental phase from day 184 to 257 the average time for tmp to increase from 5 kpa to 40 kpa was 12 2 0 2 days in r control n 5 which was shorter than 14 1 0 2 days n 5 in r ferrous and 13 6 0 1 days n 4 in r magnetite the results indicated that electrochemical iron dosing slowed membrane fouling from day 258 intermittent backwashing was applied to further mitigate fouling of the three mfts the strategy prolonged the typical membrane operating period to 22 5 2 0 days in r control n 3 while significantly prolonging the period to 28 7 3 1 days in r ferrous n 3 and 27 1 2 3 days in r magnetite n 3 the results also demonstrated that electrochemical iron dosing increases the effectiveness of backwashing on mitigating fouling to determine potential mechanisms related to mitigation of membrane fouling a group of water flux tests were conducted on the fouled membrane modules collected from each reactor mft tests were carried out on fouled membrane membrane cleaned by sodium hypochlorite membrane cleaned by citric acid and membrane cleaned with those chemicals in sequence the resultant data i e the slope of tmp increase versus flux r 2 0 99 see fig 7 a identified resistance due to fouling by composition i e organic versus inorganic substances wang et al 2014 r magnetite and r ferrous had lower total resistance than r control consistent with the tmp results obtained in the continuous operation fig 6 specifically the resistance due to organics rnaocl was 0 86 tmp lmh in r control contributing to 51 2 of total resistance this suggests that organic substances were the main cause for membrane fouling the rnaocl level decreased to 0 37 tmp lmh in r magnetite and r ferrous likely due to the lower effluent cod concentrations than that of r control table 2 in contrast the resistance due to inorganics rca almost doubled in the two iron dosed systems likely due to the residual iron in the effluent of abrs table 2 the resistance that cannot be removed by citric acid and sodium hypochlorite i e rir contributed to 15 5 total r control resistance in comparison rir substantially decreased in both r ferrous 4 1 and r magnetite 3 1 however the reason for reduction in rir remains unclear and requires further study 3 4 dosing of electrochemical iron greatly enhances anaerobic treatment of wastewater iron salts i e fecl3 are used in centralized wwtps because iron dosing can provide multiple benefits including sulfide control enhanced cod and phosphorus removal as well as membrane fouling mitigation calderon et al 2021 dong et al 2015 firer et al 2008 ge et al 2013 gutierrez et al 2010 hu et al 2021 kulandaivelu et al 2020 nielsen et al 2008 rebosura et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 however concentrated iron salt solutions are highly corrosive and pose safety issues for transport and storage here this study carried out a comprehensive assessment of the gas and liquid phases and membrane component of anaerobic processes with or without electrochemical iron dosing during long term operation the results demonstrated that addition of iron generated electrochemically either in situ or ex situ achieved higher tss vss and cod removal efficiencies lower sulfide and phosphorus concentrations in the effluent lower h2s content in the biogas and less membrane fouling than the reactor without iron dosing together these results demonstrate the feasibility of using electrochemically produced iron to generate multifaceted benefits in anaerobic wastewater treatment previous studies have reported that electrochemical iron dosing can effectively mitigate h2s emission in sewers lin et al 2017b pikaar et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the average sulfide removal efficiency in these previous studies was 76 4 95 4 these results are comparable to the relative decrease of sulfide by 83 5 88 7 achieved in this study the anaerobic treatment of wastewater often combines with membrane technology to control pathogenic organisms while use of the membrane is prone to fouling dong et al 2015 in this study organic substances were found to be the main cause for membrane resistance consistent to previous studies on anaerobic membrane processes gao et al 2013 huang et al 2011 wang and waite 2009 wu et al 2008 the dosing of electrochemical iron showed the enhanced removal of cod fig 1b and consequently the membrane resistance caused by organic substances was decreased fig 7b the fouling mitigation likely related to changed properties of mixed liquor that include soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps the organic smp and eps can accumulate to the surface of membrane and block membrane as their molecular sizes are comparable to or even smaller than the membrane pore dong et al 2015 drews et al 2007 metzger et al 2007 wang and waite 2008 zhang et al 2015 the other potential reason is that dosing of iron salts could increase particles size and enhance coagulative characteristics favourable to fouling control song et al 2008 waite et al 1999 zhang et al 2008 further the developed anaerobic membrane processes applied the total hrt of 1 5 days which is relatively long compared to the typical hrt i e 8 24 hours used for anaerobic membrane processes in previous studies smith et al 2012 this agrees with the purpose of the developed process here that could be more considered as a useful solution in a decentralized wastewater treatment scenario where system footprint is usually not a major issue in addition to performance evaluation the cost of electrochemical iron dosing was also evaluated and compared with direct dosing of iron salts as the main cost the electricity consumption of electrochemical iron dosing was estimated based on current and voltage data during long term operation for r ferrous the current was 32 ma and the voltage varied between 0 6 and 1 0 v fig s5 for r magnetite the iron was produced externally with a high current of 100 ma and high voltage of about 2 0 v combined with costs for materials the total cost for the in situ and ex situ electrochemical generation of iron was 116 5 aud ml and 131 5 aud ml wastewater respectively this represents a reduction of 24 4 33 1 compared to using conventional iron salts i e 173 9 aud ml wastewater assuming 40 w w fecl3 see details in table s4 the results suggest that electrochemical iron dosing is more cost effective than dosing with iron salts moreover the comparison of electrochemical strategies showed that r ferrous generated in situ demonstrated better overall performance in terms of all tested parameters than ex situ production of r magnetite in particular the ch4 content in the biogas from r ferrous dosing increased up to 84 8 3 2 attributed to in situ h2 production and subsequent conversion to ch4 table 2 at the same time co2 content in the biogas was as low as 13 1 2 1 due to co2 consumption during h2 conversion table 2 the results demonstrate potential for upgrading biogas to renewable natural gas i e biomethane with high ch4 and low co2 content 3 5 future research during one year of system operation under anaerobic conditions the biomass yield was low consequently no excess sludge was discharged from the three abrs except for sludge sampling however the continuous dosing of iron caused significant accumulation in the sludge and 90 of the dosed iron was retained in the experimental reactors table 2 as such with longer term operation iron species will dominate the solids in discharged excess sludge the opportunity to recover iron from the iron rich sludge requires further study moreover the present study tested an iron dosage of 80 mg fe l based on sulfide control and more investigation is needed to determine the optimal iron dosage local electrochemical generation of iron is particularly suited to a decentralized wastewater treatment plant and when combined with solar power supply it presents a cost effective and sustainable solution however despite removing most nutrients ammonium remains in the effluent after anaerobic membrane treatment thus a downstream polishing step such as vegetated biofiltration is recommended having the advantages of efficient nutrient removal small footprint and pleasant environmental aesthetics bakheet et al 2020 prodanovic et al 2017 zinger et al 2021 following biofiltration the water can be reused for landscaping urban farming and toilet flushing li et al 2009 a multicriteria analysis is warranted to assess the overall process and performance in achieving multiple aims such as low energy requirement low sludge production high energy recovery and improved water reuse 4 conclusion this study carried out a comprehensive laboratory assessment of iron dosing on anaerobic membrane processes using in situ and ex situ electrochemical iron production dosing with electrochemical iron resulted in multiple benefits such as increased tss and cod removal increased ch4 production decreased sulfide and phosphorus concentrations in effluent decreased h2s content in biogas and decreased membrane fouling although the benefits are comparable to those of dosing iron salts an inherent advantage is that electrochemically produced iron can alleviate safety concerns associated with transport and handling of corrosive concentrated iron salt solutions and avoid the issues associated with the ph decrease caused by fecl3 addition further in situ iron production was found to be preferable to ex situ generating higher ch4 with lower co2 content in the biogas overall this study demonstrates that dosing with electrochemical iron is a feasible strategy for improving wastewater management declaration

15488,partial nitritation anammox pn a is a promising deammonification process to develop energy neutral wastewater treatment plants however the mainstream application of pn a still faces the challenges of low nitrogen concentration and low temperatures and has not been studied under a realistic condition of large scale reactor kiloliter level real municipal wastewater mww and seasonal temperatures in this research a pilot scale one stage pn a with integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas configuration was operated to treat the real mww pretreated by anaerobic membrane bioreactor the removal efficiency of total nitrogen tn was 79 4 75 7 and 65 9 at 25 20 and 15 c corresponding to the effluent tn of 7 3 9 7 and 12 0 mg l respectively the suppression of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria anaob occurred at lower temperatures and the significant decrease in aob treatment capacity was the reason for the poorer nitrogen removal at 15 c biomass retention and microbial segregation were successfully achieved specifically candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were main anaob genera and mainly enriched on carriers nitrosomonas and uncultured f chitinophagaceae were main aob genera and mainly distributed in suspended sludge and retained by sedimentation tank moreover nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were sufficiently suppressed by intermittent aeration and low dissolved oxygen the presence of heterotrophic bacteria upgraded the pn a to a simultaneous partial nitritation anammox denitrification and cod oxidation snadco system which improved the overall removal of tn and cod the results of this investigation clearly evidence the strong feasibility of pn a as a mainstream nitrogen removal process in temperate climates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords partial nitritation anammox mainstream anammox ifas low temperature microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with increasing concerns over global climate change and energy depletion developing energy net zero or net positive wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been widely accepted all over the world ferri 2010 maktabifard et al 2020 in the conventional wwtps approximately 22 of input energy and 2 86 g cod g nitrate n were required for removing nitrogen via nitrification denitrification mccarty et al 2011 peng et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 since the oxygen is needed to convert ammonium nh4 to nitrate no3 and the organic carbon org c is needed as the electron donor when converting no3 to nitrogen gas n2 thus it is necessary to apply the energy saving nitrogen removal process to the municipal wastewater mww treatment one stage partial nitritation anammox pn a is a popular technical scheme of the anammox based deammonification process guo et al 2020a in the pn a process part of the nh4 is first oxidized to nitrite no2 by aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and the rest of nh4 is then oxidized to n2 by anammox bacteria anaob with no2 as the electron acceptor since only partial nitritation occurs and no org c is required the pn a process reduces aeration by 60 and allows more org c to be captured for utilization lackner et al 2014 in wwtps pn a has been successfully applied to the treatment of high strength reject water referred as the side stream process lackner et al 2014 veuillet et al 2014 however its application to the treatment of low strength mww referred as the mainstream process remains challenging firstly the ratio of cod n for typical mww was usually 5 10 kong et al 2021 the high content of org c gives denitrifying bacteria db a competitive advantage over anaob for grabbing no2 cui et al 2021 resulting in strong denitrification to dominant the nitrogen removal in pn a thus it is accepted that pn a should function in practice as a post treatment for an org c removal unit to reduce the risk of over denitrification currently several org c removal processes e g upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb malovanyy et al 2015b chemically enhanced primary sedimentation cept meerburg et al 2015 high rate aerobic activated sludge hras laureni et al 2015 and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr wu et al 2021 had been reported as a pretreat unit of the pn a among these processes anmbr is considered to be the most suitable one because it can efficiently convert the org c to methane ch4 as energy and produce the low cod n 1 2 and solids free effluent feeding pn a process rong et al 2021 secondly the low nitrogen concentration and low temperature of mww tend to result in poor nitrogen removal during a long term operation chen et al 2019 gholami shiri et al 2021 for the former challenge pn a has to operate at a short hydraulic retention time hrt to obtain a high nitrogen loading rate nlr and increase treatment capacity under such a high hydraulic load however the biosolids are easily washed out from the reactor resulting in a decrease in nitrogen removal de clippeleir et al 2013 veuillet et al 2014 for the latter challenge the low temperature of mww usually between 15 c and 25 c in temperate climates rong et al 2022b tends to suppress the activity and growth rates of microorganisms laureni et al 2015 a ten times reduction in specific activities of anaob has been reported for a temperature drop from 30 c to 10 c lotti et al 2015a and an increase in the generation time of anaob from 35 d to 132 d has been observed for a temperature drop from 20 c to 10 c lotti et al 2014 thus it is essential to maintain sufficient biomass to offset these adverse effects in the mainstream pn a process adding functional carriers to form biofilm reactor is a common measure to retain biomass aob and anaob are the two key microbes in pn a process however since aob has a much higher growth rate than that of anaob and is easily replenished from activated sludge ma et al 2015 retaining anaob is more important than retaining aob in the one stage pn a process moreover the growth characteristics of aob and anaob are different aob preferentially exists in the suspended sludge as flocs while anaob preferentially grows on the carriers as a biofilm cui et al 2021 xu et al 2019 therefore forming a biofilm is expected to facilitate the long term retention of anaob in mainstream pn a systems additionally nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob compete with anaob for no2 and compete with aob for dissolved oxygen do cao et al 2017 gholami shiri et al 2021 the growth of nob has been confirmed as the major cause of the failed pn a gilbert et al 2014 miao et al 2018 thus nob must be suppressed in pn a process free ammonia fa free nitrous acid fna low do and intermittent aeration have been verified as effective measures to inhibit nob duan et al 2019 joss et al 2011 ma et al 2015 wu et al 2021 according to the results of a previous literature a concentration of 0 08 0 82 mg l fa and 0 06 0 83 mg l fna can effectively suppress nob cao et al 2017 however due to the low nitrogen concentration in mww it is difficult to maintain sufficient fa and fna at the threshold concentrations in the mainstream pn a applications cao et al 2017 by contrast the do control and the intermittent aeration are easier adopted during the operation and are likely to become the main nob suppression strategy in the future mainstream pn a process ma et al 2015 miao et al 2018 currently successful applications of one stage pn a for the treatment of low c n substrates have proved the strong feasibility of the pn a working as a nitrogen removal process in the mww sector akaboci et al 2018 chen et al 2019 2022 cui et al 2021 ding et al 2018 gilbert et al 2014 guo et al 2021 jiang et al 2018 laureni et al 2019 however since most of the relevant studies were conducted under lab scale conditions with a synthetic substrate and at high temperatures 25 c limited information is available for its application to realistic condition of larger reactor kiloliter level real mww and seasonal temperatures simultaneously therefore in order to gain insight into the mainstream pn a process and promote its practical applications a 1670 l integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas type pn a ifas pn a was established for treating real mww pretreated by anmbr to date the start up strategy of the pn a unit by in situ nob elimination has been reported wu et al 2021 and the mass flows of c and n in the combined anmbr pn a system have been examined rong et al 2021 2022a however as the most important and challenging part the operational details and strategies application feasibility and microbial communities of the standalone mainstream ifas pn a at seasonal temperatures have not been investigated to this end this research focuses on the operation of the independent ifas pn a process for treating anmbr effluent at seasonal temperatures 15 25 c the main research objectives were 1 studying the treatment performance to evaluate the feasibility of ifas pn a for mainstream application in temperate climates 2 clarifying the temperature drop impacts on the microbial activity biomass characteristics and microbial dynamic 3 revealing the synergetic interaction among different microbial communities of suspended sludge and carriers and 4 proposing an operation strategy for mainstream ifas pn a at seasonal temperatures the results of this research are expected to promote the practical applications of mainstream pn a in the near future 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot plant design and operation procedure the pilot scale ifas pn a plant consists of a 1670 l reactor followed by a 1920 l sedimentation tank fig 1 the cylindrical hollow carriers length diameter 10 mm 10 mm density of 0 98 g cm3 specific surface area of 800 m2 m3 were added to the pn a reactor at a filling rate of 20 the pn a reactor worked with an intermittent aeration mode of 4 min on and 1 min off with the well designed aeration system the airflow rate afr can be automatically adjusted based on the influent nh4 n and residual nh4 n and do and can also be controlled manually the ifas pn a was constantly fed with the effluent of a 5000 l anmbr and the hrt of the pn a was fixed at 4 h the sludge was returned from the sedimentation tank to the pn a reactor with a sludge return ratio of 1 5 a stirring impeller was installed in the pn a reactor to enhance homogenization the pilot scale ifas pn a plant was started up successfully before this research and the details of start up strategy have been reported in a previous study wu et al 2021 in this research the ifas pn a was operated in a temperature drop program from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c which simulated the actual operation of summer autumn and winter in temperate climates the 151 day operation period was divided into three phases phase ⅰ 25 c phase ⅱ 20 c and phase ⅲ 15 c the operation details of the pilot plant are provided in table 1 since the anmbr had been investigated as a standalone process in a previous study rong et al 2022b in this research it was just employed to provide pretreated mww to the pn a unit and has the same temperature setting as the pn a 2 2 analytical methods the temperature ph do afr and nh4 n mixture were real time recorded by the auto control system the influent and effluent of the ifas pn a were collected on a daily basis and the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were accurately determined by capillary electrophoresis 7100ce agilent technologies usa these nitrogen species were used to evaluate the in situ reaction rates of aob and anaob to adjust the afr other indicators including cod bod5 alkalinity mixed liquor suspended solid mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were determined three times a week according to the apha standard methods apha awwa wef 2017 the characteristics of suspended sludge and biofilm carriers were analyzed at the three phases specifically sv30 and settling velocity of the suspended sludge were measured by a 1 l measuring cylinder the particle size of the suspended sludge was measured by a laser diffraction particle size distribution psd meter mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical uk and the morphology of the biofilm carriers was observed and recorded by the camera 2 3 batch microbial treatment potential test batch microbial treatment potential test bmtpt was conducted to determine the ex situ treatment capacities of aob anaob and nob which can reflect the effects of sudden temperature shock during temperature transitions and the long term effects of temperature drops since biomass existed both as flocs in suspended sludge and as biofilm on the carriers in this ifas pn a system the ex situ bmtpt of independent suspended sludge independent biofilm carriers and their combination mixture was performed at the three temperature phases for each bmtpt 20 carriers about 7 85 cm3 45 ml suspend sludge and 47 1 ml mixture 39 3 ml suspended sludge and 20 carriers to simulate 20 filling rate were randomly sampled from the pn a reactor the incubation temperature of bmtpt was consistent with that of an actual pn a during operation the substrate and procedure of the bmtpt were the same as that outlined by a previous study guo et al 2020b the results of bmtpt were unified as the kg n m3 d per kg nitrogen removal per m3 reactor volume per day for comparison 2 4 high throughput sequencing analyses the microbial community of the ifas pn a system was revealed by high throughput sequencing the microbes of the suspended sludge and the biofilm carriers were analyzed for the three temperature phases to maximize the quantity of microbes in the biofilm detected 10 carriers were randomly sampled from the pn a reactor in each sampling and the biofilm was scraped off and mixed in a sterile environment all of the samples were stored at 20 c before analysis the procedure of the high throughput sequencing was the same as that in one previous research wu et al 2021 2 5 calculations the in situ and ex situ reaction rates of the ifas pn a and the other parameters involved were calculated according to eqs 1 5 including the ammonia oxidation rate aor the anammox nitrogen removal rate anr the nlr and the nitrogen removal rate nrr 1 δ n n h 4 n i n n o 2 n i n n h 4 n e f f n o 2 n e f f 2 a o r n o 2 n e f f n o 2 n i n δ n 1 32 2 32 1000

and total inorganic nitrogen respectively while the n h 4 n e f f n o 2 n e f f and t i n e f f are the counterparts in the effluent 3 results 3 1 treatment performance of the ifas pn a at seasonal temperatures as shown in table 2 the influent tn and nh4 n of the ifas pn a were 35 6 40 1 mg l and 30 9 35 1 mg l respectively which helped the pn a maintain a stable nlr of 0 21 0 24 kg n m3 d the influent cod was 40 1 44 6 mg l and the cod nh4 n was 1 14 1 44 indicating that a stable influent was fed to the pn a throughout the entire operation period the nitrogen removal performance at the three phases is shown in fig 2 and table 2 in phase ⅰ of 25 c the ifas pn a system achieved stable nitrogen removal the removal efficiencies of tn nre and nh4 n are were 79 4 3 0 and 81 3 6 7 corresponding to the effluent tn and nh4 n of 7 3 1 2 and 6 2 1 6 mg l respectively the in situ ratio of aor anr was 0 65 0 72 indicating that a good balance between aob and anaob was maintained at the do of 0 1 0 8 mg l and the mean afr of 64 5 l min at 25 c on d58 the operating temperature was switched to 20 c to start phase ⅱ since microbial activities tend to be suppressed at a lower temperature the afr was temporarily reduced to 52 l min to avoid over aeration to grow nob on d59 an accumulation of nh4 n of 11 6 mg l was observed and no residual no2 n in the effluent indicating that nitritation had become the rate limiting step of the pn a therefore the afr was gradually increased and reached to 66 5 l min on d64 which was followed by a gradual increase in nre from 60 to a peak of 84 4 thereafter the ifas pn a stably operated for the rest of phase ⅱ with a mean nre of 75 7 9 2 and an are of 86 4 7 5 accompanied by the effluent tn and nh4 n of 9 7 3 6 and 4 7 2 6 mg l on d109 the operating temperature was further reduced to 15 c like the temperature transition at 20 c the afr was temporarily adjusted to 52 l min on d110 an increase in residual nh4 n of 10 9 mg l was observed indicating that the aeration was insufficient to oxidize the influent nh4 n meanwhile about 2 5 mg l of no2 n was detected in the effluent indicating that anaob activity may also have been suppressed thus the afr was carefully increased with maintaining the balance between aor and anr from d115 the nre gradually increased and then reached a high level of 72 81 with an afr of about 63 l min however from d123 to d129 the malfunction of the online do sensor resulted in higher than actual do values being displayed these incorrect do values led to confusion in adjusting afr resulting in an insufficient air supply and the consequent accumulation of nh4 n therefore the nre significantly reduced to 49 58 after the do sensor was working normally again a stable nre and are of 65 9 8 8 and 75 6 11 6 and a stable effluent tn and nh4 n of 12 0 2 8 and 7 4 2 3 mg l were achieved during the remainder of phase ⅲ additionally the pilot ifas pn a plant also has the ability to remove org c fig 3 and table 2 approximately 13 7 20 9 mg l cod and 5 1 6 8 mg l bod5 were eliminated during the operation period corresponding to removal efficiencies of cod and bod5 of 32 6 50 4 and 36 8 59 2 respectively in addition no no3 n was detected in the effluent fig 2 c indicating that the denitrification existing in the pn a reactor and helped to improve the effluent quality by removing org c and nitrogen simultaneously moreover as shown in fig 3 b the actual removed cod was much higher than that calculated based on the removed no3 n 2 86 g cod for removing 1 g no3 n via denitrification rong et al 2022a it can therefore be inferred that the ordinary heterotrophic organism oho heterotrophic bacteria hb except denitrifying bacteria was also present and that it enhanced the ability to remove cod as a result the pilot scale ifas pn a plant actually functioned as a simultaneous partial nitritation anammox denitrification and cod oxidation snadco system an overview of the treatment performance of the ifas pn a is that the mean nre decreased with temperature drops especially when the temperature lowered to 15 c which was similar to the result of a previous study akaboci et al 2018 in addition org c was efficiently removed in the ifas pn a at the three temperature phases as a result the effluent tn nh4 n cod and bod5 of this pilot plant were lower than 15 10 35 and 10 mg l respectively 3 2 temperature effects on the microbial treatment capacity the temperature effects on the treatment capacity of different microorganisms and their distribution in the ifas pn a system were understood by bmtpt the aob and anaob treatment capacities of independent suspended sludge independent carriers and mixtures suspended sludge carriers were defined as aor sludge and anr sludge aor carrier and anr carrier and aor mixture and anr mixture respectively as shown in fig 4 a for the temperature effects on the overall treatment capacity both aor mixture and anr mixture decreased with temperature drops the mean aor mixture of the stable period was 0 26 0 17 and 0 14 kg n m3 d and the mean anr mixture was 0 81 0 73 and 0 40 kg n m3 d at 25 20 and 15 c respectively the anr mixture was consistently higher than the nlr of 0 21 0 24 kg n m3 d at the three phases indicating that the treatment capacity of anaob always meets the treatment requirement the aor mixture was lower than the nlr at 20 c and 15 c however considering that only about 55 of nh4 n was needed to be converted to no2 n of the pn a reaction wu et al 2021 thus the aor mixture at 25 c and 20 c still meet the nlr requirement and the low aor mixture at 15 c was the reason for the poorer nre in phase ⅲ in addition fig 2 e shows that the aor mixture and anr mixture both decreased sharply during the temperature transitions when the operating temperature was switched to 20 c and 15 c the aor mixture dropped to 0 1 and 0 1 kg n m3 d and the anr mixture dropped to 0 45 and 0 29 kg n m3 d immediately this result was in accordance with the sudden reduction in nitrogen removal during the temperature transitions on d58 and d109 indicating that the sudden temperature shocks have a significant impact on the activity of aob and anaob it should be noted that the nre rebounded rapidly after a short adaptation period fig 2 b suggesting that a long term adaption would be beneficial in improving microbial activity de clippeleir et al 2013 moreover according to the results of the ex situ tests the nob activity was 0 at the three phases indicating that nob was well suppressed in this ifas pn a the results of the temperature effects on the treatment capacities of independent suspended sludge and biofilm carriers are shown in fig 4 b and c as shown in fig 4 c the anr carrier was 0 77 0 74 and 0 39 kg n m3 d which accounted for 99 2 98 6 and 93 7 of the total mixture anr at 25 20 and 15 c respectively this result demonstrated that the biofilm carriers were mainly responsible for anammox in this ifas pn a system the anr sludge was 0 006 0 011 and 0 027 kg n m3 d at 25 20 and 15 c respectively although the anr sludge can be considered negligible when compared with the anr carrier the increasing trend of anr sludge suggests that a little bit of biofilm may be detached from carriers at lower temperatures aor was found both for the suspended sludge and the biofilm carriers as shown in fig 4 b the aor sludge was 0 174 0 099 and 0 086 kg n m3 d and the aor carrier was 0 067 0 045 and 0 084 kg n m3 d at 25 20 and 15 c respectively this indicates that some aob existing in the biofilm and that the carriers therefore also contributed to nitritation noting that the aor sludge was much higher than the aor carrier at 25 c and 20 c whereas their values were very close at 15 c indicating that the suspended sludge dominated the nitritation in this ifas pn a but the importance of carriers in nitritation increased with temperature drops thus on the basis of the above results it can be inferred that the anaob was well enriched by the carriers as biofilm while the aob was mainly distributed in the suspended sludge as flocs 3 3 retention and characteristics of the suspended sludge and biofilm in this research no sludge was discharged from ifas pn a throughout the entire operation period the suspended sludge of the pn a reactor was well maintained at a mean mlss of 2050 2130 and 2340 mg l and a mean mlvss of 1730 1760 and 1990 mg l during phase ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ respectively the ratio of mlvss mlss was about 0 85 since the retention of suspended sludge is closely related to settleability the characteristics of the suspended sludge at different temperatures were determined as shown in fig 5 with the operating temperature dropped from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c the sv30 of the suspended sludge reduced from 94 to 79 to 68 and the settling velocity calculated in 30 min settlement increased from 0 0036 to 0 0115 to 0 0187 m h respectively the svi calculated for the three temperature phases were 458 371 and 290 ml g the results of the psd analysis show an increase in the particle size of the suspended sludge with temperature drops the mean sizes were 45 0 61 6 and 72 4 μm and the d50 were 31 7 42 7 and 48 6 μm at 25 20 and 15 c respectively it should be noted however that although the settleability of suspended sludge was improved at lower temperatures it is still worse than the conventional activated sludge for which svi 300 ml g is generally regarded to sludge bulking the photographs of the carriers are given in fig 6 compared with the virgin carriers and the carriers of the start up period obvious dark red color biofilm was observed on the carries of the three temperature phases the ifas pn a was long term operated at 25 c before this research the overall operation time exceeded 400 days was long enough for the growth of biofilm however the biofilm in this research was only distributed on the interior surface of the carriers and much thinner than that of the same carries in a side stream lab scale reactor operating for 156 days qian et al 2022 of which the hollow holes of the carriers were almost filled by the biofilm this difference may be attributed to the low nlr and the strong hydraulic flush in this research note that no obvious biofilm shedding or detachment occurred as the temperatures were decreased this is evidence that the thin biofilm was dense and solid enough to cope with the strong hydraulic flush to retain the biomass in addition the color of the biofilm in this study was not as bright as that observed for the side stream process qian et al 2022 according to the result of a previous study the dark red color was attributed to the growth of hb cao et al 2019 comparing with the biofilm at phase ⅰ and ⅱ the grey sludge was found on the carriers of phase ⅲ indicating that more hb may grow on the carriers at the low temperature of 15 c 3 4 microbial community at seasonal temperatures the microbial communities of the suspended sludge flocs and the biofilm at the three phases are shown at the phylum level in fig 7 a and b and at the genus level in fig 7 c only the group with a relative abundance of 1 in one sample is presented at the phylum level a total of 25 groups and 26 groups were found in the flocs and the biofilm respectively and the most abundant phyla were proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes and planctomycetes demonstrating the high consistency between the flocs and biofilm with the temperature dropped from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c in the flocs the proteobacteria increased from 36 5 to 45 6 to 50 8 the chloroflexi increased from 12 9 to 18 5 to 22 3 the bacteroidetes decreased from 22 6 to 12 4 to 10 2 and the planctomycetes changed from 8 2 to 8 7 to 3 4 respectively whereas in the biofilm their relative abundance was in the range of 19 6 22 8 21 2 28 4 12 1 16 8 and 10 1 14 5 respectively this result indicates that the microbial community of biofilm is much more stable than that of flocs it should be noted that a high abundance of chloroflexi was observed according to the previous literature the chloroflexi likely worked as the backbone of biofilm xu et al 2019 in addition the chloroflexia was filamentous bacteria wang et al 2021 its high abundance in flocs may the reason for the poor settleability of the suspended sludge at the genus level aob was the dominate group in flocs including the nitrosomonas 16 4 3 9 3 5 uncultured f chitinophagaceae 5 2 5 9 5 5 uncultured f pirellulaceae 1 6 0 9 1 1 and niabella 1 1 0 9 1 3 meanwhile the aob of the nitrosomonas 5 6 1 0 1 0 and uncultured f chitinophagaceae 4 9 6 2 4 9 were found in biofilm these results demonstrate that both the suspended sludge and the biofilm carriers contributed to the nitritation with the greatest contribution from the suspended sludge which is consistent with the results of bmtpt it should be noted however that there was a significant reduction in nitrosomonas at 20 c and 15 c while the uncultured f chitinophagaceae was stable in the three phases together with the ex situ aor results in section 3 2 it confirms that the reduction of nitrosomonas is the reason for the deteriorated aor sludge and the uncultured f chitinophagaceae was important for the ifas pn a to process nitritation at lower temperatures the main anaob genera were candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia which were also the dominant anaob community of the seeding sludge wu et al 2021 in the biofilm the relative abundances of candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were 6 5 4 2 and 7 6 and 3 3 2 6 and 2 8 at 25 20 and 15 c respectively the higher relative abundance of candidatus brocadia was attributed to its better survivability than other anaob under the condition with cod and to the habit of growing on biofilm cui et al 2021 in the suspended sludge only a tiny proportion of candidatus kuenenia was found 0 1 this result is consistent with the result of the bmtpt and confirms that the anaob was successfully enriched on the carriers this result was in line with that of a previous ifas pn a reactor veuillet et al 2014 the db was also detected in the flocs and the biofilm in the flocs the db included hyphomicrobium 4 6 3 7 4 9 uncultured o phycisphaerales 3 0 6 6 1 3 dok59 2 6 4 7 5 6 uncultured f sinobacteraceae 2 4 1 2 0 9 paracoccus 2 2 0 2 0 3 and uncultured f caldilineaceae 2 1 4 1 7 4 in the biofilm the db included dok59 4 7 10 9 1 uncultured o phycisphaerales 2 7 2 3 1 9 uncultured o solibacterales 1 9 2 0 2 0 and hyphomicrobium 1 7 1 0 1 1 these results confirm the presence of denitrification in the pn a and explain why no3 n was not detected in the effluent in addition the dok59 may be a candidatus desulfobacillus via the sequence alignment in this research the high and increasing abundance of dok59 was attributed to the increase in influent s2 because more h2s was dissolved in the anmbr effluent at lower temperatures rong et al 2022b in addition oho were also found in the flocs and the biofilm in the flocs the uncultured o gca004 4 6 3 1 2 9 and the verrucomicrobium 0 2 1 7 1 7 functioned for carbohydrate degradation the uncultured f saprospiraceae 3 8 3 8 2 6 functioned for protein degradation in the biofilm the uncultured o gca004 7 5 6 4 6 7 the uncultured f s47 6 2 10 8 10 7 the uncultured o sphingobacteriales 4 0 4 2 3 6 and the uncultured f saprospiraceae 2 6 0 2 0 2 were detected the existence of oho is evidence that cod removal in the ifas pn a was not merely due to the denitrifiers and also explains the much higher actual cod removal than the theoretical cod removal calculated based on the removed no3 n it should be noted that nob nitrospira was only detected on the biofilm with a relative abundance of 0 1 0 2 this result suggested that nob was well suppressed in the ifas pn a which was in line with the result of bmtpt interestingly methylosinus one of the methane oxidizing bacteria mob was found in the ifas pn a and its relative abundance in flocs increased from 1 7 to 5 4 to 6 0 with the temperature dropped from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c this is because more ch4 was dissolved in the anmbr effluent at lower temperatures which promoted the growth of mob in the suspended sludge by contrast the methylosinus on the biofilm was much lower than that in the flocs and was stable in the range of 1 1 1 7 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of ifas pn a offsets the adverse effects of temperature drop in this research a 1 670 l ifas pn a system was investigated for the treatment of anaerobically pretreated mww at seasonal temperatures of 25 20 and 15 c the above analyses clearly show that the biomass was efficiently retained by the sedimentation tank and the carriers and the different microbial communities were segregated in flocs and biofilm which effectively offsets the adverse impacts of temperature drop and hydraulic flush to maintain an excellent removal of n and org c the effluent tn and cod meet the requirements of the effluent discharged standards tn 15 mg l and cod 35 mg l indicating that ifas pn a is a successful process for the treatment of mww in temperate climates however it should be noted that ifas pn a is a complex system on the one hand different microbes aob anaob and hb db and oho were found in the system and were distributed in the suspended sludge and biofilm simultaneously on the other hand the microbial communities and treatment capacities as well as biomass characteristics were affected by temperature drops therefore it is expected that there is a complicated interaction among the microbial communities and with the flocs and biofilm a schematic diagram is provided in fig 8 to illustrate the interaction and function mechanism of the ifas pn a as an ifas system the oxygen transfer rate of the biofilm is much slower than that of the flocs veuillet et al 2014 under a condition with intermittent aeration the anoxic environment was formed easily on the bottom layer of biofilm which favored the growth of anaob this may explain why the anaob was found in the carriers only while the aob existed on carriers and suspended sludge on the basis of the biofilm structure reported in previous studies and the habits of the microbial communities it can be inferred that aob and hb were at the surface layer of the biofilm to obtain do while anaob was at the bottom layer of the biofilm to circumvent do gustavsson et al 2020 poot et al 2016 vlaeminck et al 2010 winkler et al 2011 however in the suspended sludge aob and hb mixed together forming the flocs under such a spatial microbial distribution the influent nh4 n and do contacted the flocs first in the ifas system at higher temperatures of 20 c due to the faster microbial activity of aob and the rapid mass transfer rates of the oxygen and nh4 n the aob in suspended sludge aob sludge efficiently converts the nh4 n to no2 n meanwhile the thin biofilm enhanced the mass transfer rates and accessibility of substrates therefore the nh4 n and no2 n can rapidly penetrate the biofilm and reach to the bottom layer and then be removed by anaob on carriers anaob carrier therefore at temperatures of 20 c the suspended sludge and carriers were responsible for nitritation and anammox respectively however at the low temperature of 15 c the aor sludge and the mass transfer rates of oxygen and nh4 n were reduced resulting in the aob sludge cannot convert the nh4 n in time resulting in the aob on carriers aob carrier has the opportunity for capturing nh4 n to process nitritation therefore the aob carrier and the aob sludge complete the nitritation together and the importance of the aob carrier increased at lower temperatures 4 2 insight into the decrease in aor and the suppression of nob in this research insufficient nitritation was the rate limiting step in the pn a process resulting in a decrease in nitrogen removal at 15 c this phenomenon was also found in other pn a studies de clippeleir et al 2013 lotti et al 2015b and the possible reasons are as follows it has been proven that aob was sensitive to temperature drop and the activity of aob was easily suppressed at lower temperatures wang et al 2021 in this research the ifas pn a worked as a snadco system where aob has to compete with oho for oxygen since about 37 5 43 5 mg l cod was contained in the influent the oho outcompeted the aob under this org c rich condition de clippeleir et al 2013 moreover in order to maintain sufficient biomass sludge was not extracted from the sedimentation tank during the operation due to the fixed sludge return ratio and the increased settleability of flocs a large quantity of suspended sludge was trapped in the sedimentation tank under the anoxic condition thus a considerable portion of aob became aged or died resulting in a reduction of the aor sludge in addition the irregular sludge extraction resulted in long solids retention time 100 days which aggravated the cell lysis to release organics and further conducive to the growth of oho this is why a high abundance of microbial associated with carbohydrate and protein degradation was observed at lower temperatures by contrast the aob carrier was almost unaffected by temperature drops this was attributed to the aob carrier on the surface of the biofilm this allowed the aob carrier always presented in the pn a reactor to access oxygen and also to be replaced by new energetic microbes due to the hydraulic flush in time nob was well suppressed in this ifas pn a system different from a pure pn a process since the presence of db in the reactor the 0 no3 of the effluent results in the failure to determine the reaction rate of nob however the result of high throughput sequencing showed that only a tiny abundance of nob on the carriers demonstrated that the successful nob controlling strategy was adopted in this research as mentioned this pilot scale pn a plant was started up with a strategy of in situ nob elimination by fa and fna wu et al 2021 and was long term operated with the synthetic substrate 3000 to 100 mg nh4 n l at 25 c to grow biofilm therefore the nob had been efficiently eliminated by exposing to a long term high fa and fna before this research in this research the ifas pn a operating with an intermittent aeration mode since the nob has a longer lag time than aob during the transition from anoxic to aerobic conditions zhang et al 2019 it was inhibited at the transit anoxia during the daily operation moreover aob nob and oho are competitors for oxygen it has been reported that the binding capacity of aob towards oxygen is stronger than that of nob resulting in higher oxygen availability for aob than that for nob cao et al 2017 in addition from the perspective of microbial distribution nob resided more internally than aob in an ifas pn a and are more prone to oxygen limitation vlaeminck et al 2010 lotti et al 2014c in an aeration cycle of this pilot plant the instantaneous do was usually 0 8 mg l during the aeration on and was 0 during the aeration off the maximum do was still lower than the half saturation coefficient of nob to do 1 2 1 5 mg l picioreanu et al 1997 as a result under the condition of intermittent aeration and limited oxygen nob was efficiently suppressed in the ifas pn a 4 3 the contribution and implication of this research this research is the first ifas type pn a process at such a large pilot scale 1670 l and changing temperatures thus the results of this research are worthy of comparison with other type pn a studies to provide references for developing the mainstream pn a ifas pn a is a hybrid system including suspended sludge and biofilm since a large amount of aob existing in suspended sludge to enhance nitritation malovanyy et al 2015b the nre of ifas is usually much higher than the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr process and thus could be operated in short hrt to meet the requirement of mainstream applications malovanyy et al 2015a similarly compared with the floc type pn a ifas pn a has an advantage in retaining biomass especially the precious anaob by biofilm this means that the ifas pn a usually has a higher mlvss than the floc type pn a at hydraulic flush and could be operated at a high nlr and volumetric loading rate guo et al 2020b the granule type pn a is characterized by higher mlvss and excellent settleability which has the potential to be operated with a small sedimentation tank and short hrt high nlr however different from the ifas pn a has a strong tolerance to the fluctuation of operation parameters the granulation has strict requirements of ph hydraulic condition and additional materials chen et al 2022 therefore the ifas pn a has better operability than the granule type pn a in daily operations most importantly the nrr of ifas pn a was 0 15 0 18 kg n m3 d in this research which is much higher than that of conventional nitrification denitrification in activated sludge of 0 05 0 1 kg n m3 d cao et al 2017 indicating that ifas pn a meets the treatment requirements for the practical applications moreover in this research the pn a worked as the post treatment unit of anmbr the excellent effluent quality of the pn a together with the excellent energy efficiency of the anmbr demonstrating the strong feasibility of the mainstream anmbr pn a as the alternative to conventional aerobic process in addition it should be emphasized that some key points required special attention when operating the mainstream ifas pn a due to the poor settleability of suspended sludge the ifas pn a systems require a higher standard of sedimentation tank to avoid biomass washout to avoid the reduction of aob abundance and to improve the treatment capacity of aob the suspended sludge should be extracted regularly from the system to eliminate the aged biomass and a much higher sludge return ratio was needed at lower temperatures 15 c most importantly the ifas pn a has a poor phosphorus p removal 2 table 2 in order to meet the discharged standards of p a post treatment of pn a effluent was also required 5 conclusions in this research a pilot scale ifas pn a succeed in the treatment of actual mww pretreated by anmbr at decreasing temperatures from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c leading to the following conclusions 1 under the nlr of 0 21 0 24 kg n m3 d the nre decreased from 79 4 to 75 7 to 65 9 when the operating temperature dropped from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c respectively the insufficient treatment capacity of aob was blamed for the sharp reduction of nre at 15 c 2 anaob were enriched in biofilm and retained by carriers aob were mainly distributed in flocs and retained by the sedimentation tank the successful biomass retention and microbial segregation compensate for the impacts of low temperature 3 only a tiny relative abundance of nob 0 1 0 2 was found in the system demonstrated that nob was well suppressed by the strategy of intermittent aeration 4 min on and 1 min off and low do about 0 8 mg l for long term operation 4 the presence of db and oho improved the overall removal of tn and cod the good effluent quality tn 15 mg l cod 35 mg l indicated that the ifas pn a can be applied for the treatment of actual mww when the temperature 15 c declaration of competing interest the

15488,partial nitritation anammox pn a is a promising deammonification process to develop energy neutral wastewater treatment plants however the mainstream application of pn a still faces the challenges of low nitrogen concentration and low temperatures and has not been studied under a realistic condition of large scale reactor kiloliter level real municipal wastewater mww and seasonal temperatures in this research a pilot scale one stage pn a with integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas configuration was operated to treat the real mww pretreated by anaerobic membrane bioreactor the removal efficiency of total nitrogen tn was 79 4 75 7 and 65 9 at 25 20 and 15 c corresponding to the effluent tn of 7 3 9 7 and 12 0 mg l respectively the suppression of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria anaob occurred at lower temperatures and the significant decrease in aob treatment capacity was the reason for the poorer nitrogen removal at 15 c biomass retention and microbial segregation were successfully achieved specifically candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were main anaob genera and mainly enriched on carriers nitrosomonas and uncultured f chitinophagaceae were main aob genera and mainly distributed in suspended sludge and retained by sedimentation tank moreover nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were sufficiently suppressed by intermittent aeration and low dissolved oxygen the presence of heterotrophic bacteria upgraded the pn a to a simultaneous partial nitritation anammox denitrification and cod oxidation snadco system which improved the overall removal of tn and cod the results of this investigation clearly evidence the strong feasibility of pn a as a mainstream nitrogen removal process in temperate climates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords partial nitritation anammox mainstream anammox ifas low temperature microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with increasing concerns over global climate change and energy depletion developing energy net zero or net positive wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been widely accepted all over the world ferri 2010 maktabifard et al 2020 in the conventional wwtps approximately 22 of input energy and 2 86 g cod g nitrate n were required for removing nitrogen via nitrification denitrification mccarty et al 2011 peng et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 since the oxygen is needed to convert ammonium nh4 to nitrate no3 and the organic carbon org c is needed as the electron donor when converting no3 to nitrogen gas n2 thus it is necessary to apply the energy saving nitrogen removal process to the municipal wastewater mww treatment one stage partial nitritation anammox pn a is a popular technical scheme of the anammox based deammonification process guo et al 2020a in the pn a process part of the nh4 is first oxidized to nitrite no2 by aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and the rest of nh4 is then oxidized to n2 by anammox bacteria anaob with no2 as the electron acceptor since only partial nitritation occurs and no org c is required the pn a process reduces aeration by 60 and allows more org c to be captured for utilization lackner et al 2014 in wwtps pn a has been successfully applied to the treatment of high strength reject water referred as the side stream process lackner et al 2014 veuillet et al 2014 however its application to the treatment of low strength mww referred as the mainstream process remains challenging firstly the ratio of cod n for typical mww was usually 5 10 kong et al 2021 the high content of org c gives denitrifying bacteria db a competitive advantage over anaob for grabbing no2 cui et al 2021 resulting in strong denitrification to dominant the nitrogen removal in pn a thus it is accepted that pn a should function in practice as a post treatment for an org c removal unit to reduce the risk of over denitrification currently several org c removal processes e g upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb malovanyy et al 2015b chemically enhanced primary sedimentation cept meerburg et al 2015 high rate aerobic activated sludge hras laureni et al 2015 and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr wu et al 2021 had been reported as a pretreat unit of the pn a among these processes anmbr is considered to be the most suitable one because it can efficiently convert the org c to methane ch4 as energy and produce the low cod n 1 2 and solids free effluent feeding pn a process rong et al 2021 secondly the low nitrogen concentration and low temperature of mww tend to result in poor nitrogen removal during a long term operation chen et al 2019 gholami shiri et al 2021 for the former challenge pn a has to operate at a short hydraulic retention time hrt to obtain a high nitrogen loading rate nlr and increase treatment capacity under such a high hydraulic load however the biosolids are easily washed out from the reactor resulting in a decrease in nitrogen removal de clippeleir et al 2013 veuillet et al 2014 for the latter challenge the low temperature of mww usually between 15 c and 25 c in temperate climates rong et al 2022b tends to suppress the activity and growth rates of microorganisms laureni et al 2015 a ten times reduction in specific activities of anaob has been reported for a temperature drop from 30 c to 10 c lotti et al 2015a and an increase in the generation time of anaob from 35 d to 132 d has been observed for a temperature drop from 20 c to 10 c lotti et al 2014 thus it is essential to maintain sufficient biomass to offset these adverse effects in the mainstream pn a process adding functional carriers to form biofilm reactor is a common measure to retain biomass aob and anaob are the two key microbes in pn a process however since aob has a much higher growth rate than that of anaob and is easily replenished from activated sludge ma et al 2015 retaining anaob is more important than retaining aob in the one stage pn a process moreover the growth characteristics of aob and anaob are different aob preferentially exists in the suspended sludge as flocs while anaob preferentially grows on the carriers as a biofilm cui et al 2021 xu et al 2019 therefore forming a biofilm is expected to facilitate the long term retention of anaob in mainstream pn a systems additionally nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob compete with anaob for no2 and compete with aob for dissolved oxygen do cao et al 2017 gholami shiri et al 2021 the growth of nob has been confirmed as the major cause of the failed pn a gilbert et al 2014 miao et al 2018 thus nob must be suppressed in pn a process free ammonia fa free nitrous acid fna low do and intermittent aeration have been verified as effective measures to inhibit nob duan et al 2019 joss et al 2011 ma et al 2015 wu et al 2021 according to the results of a previous literature a concentration of 0 08 0 82 mg l fa and 0 06 0 83 mg l fna can effectively suppress nob cao et al 2017 however due to the low nitrogen concentration in mww it is difficult to maintain sufficient fa and fna at the threshold concentrations in the mainstream pn a applications cao et al 2017 by contrast the do control and the intermittent aeration are easier adopted during the operation and are likely to become the main nob suppression strategy in the future mainstream pn a process ma et al 2015 miao et al 2018 currently successful applications of one stage pn a for the treatment of low c n substrates have proved the strong feasibility of the pn a working as a nitrogen removal process in the mww sector akaboci et al 2018 chen et al 2019 2022 cui et al 2021 ding et al 2018 gilbert et al 2014 guo et al 2021 jiang et al 2018 laureni et al 2019 however since most of the relevant studies were conducted under lab scale conditions with a synthetic substrate and at high temperatures 25 c limited information is available for its application to realistic condition of larger reactor kiloliter level real mww and seasonal temperatures simultaneously therefore in order to gain insight into the mainstream pn a process and promote its practical applications a 1670 l integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas type pn a ifas pn a was established for treating real mww pretreated by anmbr to date the start up strategy of the pn a unit by in situ nob elimination has been reported wu et al 2021 and the mass flows of c and n in the combined anmbr pn a system have been examined rong et al 2021 2022a however as the most important and challenging part the operational details and strategies application feasibility and microbial communities of the standalone mainstream ifas pn a at seasonal temperatures have not been investigated to this end this research focuses on the operation of the independent ifas pn a process for treating anmbr effluent at seasonal temperatures 15 25 c the main research objectives were 1 studying the treatment performance to evaluate the feasibility of ifas pn a for mainstream application in temperate climates 2 clarifying the temperature drop impacts on the microbial activity biomass characteristics and microbial dynamic 3 revealing the synergetic interaction among different microbial communities of suspended sludge and carriers and 4 proposing an operation strategy for mainstream ifas pn a at seasonal temperatures the results of this research are expected to promote the practical applications of mainstream pn a in the near future 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot plant design and operation procedure the pilot scale ifas pn a plant consists of a 1670 l reactor followed by a 1920 l sedimentation tank fig 1 the cylindrical hollow carriers length diameter 10 mm 10 mm density of 0 98 g cm3 specific surface area of 800 m2 m3 were added to the pn a reactor at a filling rate of 20 the pn a reactor worked with an intermittent aeration mode of 4 min on and 1 min off with the well designed aeration system the airflow rate afr can be automatically adjusted based on the influent nh4 n and residual nh4 n and do and can also be controlled manually the ifas pn a was constantly fed with the effluent of a 5000 l anmbr and the hrt of the pn a was fixed at 4 h the sludge was returned from the sedimentation tank to the pn a reactor with a sludge return ratio of 1 5 a stirring impeller was installed in the pn a reactor to enhance homogenization the pilot scale ifas pn a plant was started up successfully before this research and the details of start up strategy have been reported in a previous study wu et al 2021 in this research the ifas pn a was operated in a temperature drop program from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c which simulated the actual operation of summer autumn and winter in temperate climates the 151 day operation period was divided into three phases phase ⅰ 25 c phase ⅱ 20 c and phase ⅲ 15 c the operation details of the pilot plant are provided in table 1 since the anmbr had been investigated as a standalone process in a previous study rong et al 2022b in this research it was just employed to provide pretreated mww to the pn a unit and has the same temperature setting as the pn a 2 2 analytical methods the temperature ph do afr and nh4 n mixture were real time recorded by the auto control system the influent and effluent of the ifas pn a were collected on a daily basis and the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were accurately determined by capillary electrophoresis 7100ce agilent technologies usa these nitrogen species were used to evaluate the in situ reaction rates of aob and anaob to adjust the afr other indicators including cod bod5 alkalinity mixed liquor suspended solid mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were determined three times a week according to the apha standard methods apha awwa wef 2017 the characteristics of suspended sludge and biofilm carriers were analyzed at the three phases specifically sv30 and settling velocity of the suspended sludge were measured by a 1 l measuring cylinder the particle size of the suspended sludge was measured by a laser diffraction particle size distribution psd meter mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical uk and the morphology of the biofilm carriers was observed and recorded by the camera 2 3 batch microbial treatment potential test batch microbial treatment potential test bmtpt was conducted to determine the ex situ treatment capacities of aob anaob and nob which can reflect the effects of sudden temperature shock during temperature transitions and the long term effects of temperature drops since biomass existed both as flocs in suspended sludge and as biofilm on the carriers in this ifas pn a system the ex situ bmtpt of independent suspended sludge independent biofilm carriers and their combination mixture was performed at the three temperature phases for each bmtpt 20 carriers about 7 85 cm3 45 ml suspend sludge and 47 1 ml mixture 39 3 ml suspended sludge and 20 carriers to simulate 20 filling rate were randomly sampled from the pn a reactor the incubation temperature of bmtpt was consistent with that of an actual pn a during operation the substrate and procedure of the bmtpt were the same as that outlined by a previous study guo et al 2020b the results of bmtpt were unified as the kg n m3 d per kg nitrogen removal per m3 reactor volume per day for comparison 2 4 high throughput sequencing analyses the microbial community of the ifas pn a system was revealed by high throughput sequencing the microbes of the suspended sludge and the biofilm carriers were analyzed for the three temperature phases to maximize the quantity of microbes in the biofilm detected 10 carriers were randomly sampled from the pn a reactor in each sampling and the biofilm was scraped off and mixed in a sterile environment all of the samples were stored at 20 c before analysis the procedure of the high throughput sequencing was the same as that in one previous research wu et al 2021 2 5 calculations the in situ and ex situ reaction rates of the ifas pn a and the other parameters involved were calculated according to eqs 1 5 including the ammonia oxidation rate aor the anammox nitrogen removal rate anr the nlr and the nitrogen removal rate nrr 1 δ n n h 4 n i n n o 2 n i n n h 4 n e f f n o 2 n e f f 2 a o r n o 2 n e f f n o 2 n i n δ n 1 32 2 32 1000

and total inorganic nitrogen respectively while the n h 4 n e f f n o 2 n e f f and t i n e f f are the counterparts in the effluent 3 results 3 1 treatment performance of the ifas pn a at seasonal temperatures as shown in table 2 the influent tn and nh4 n of the ifas pn a were 35 6 40 1 mg l and 30 9 35 1 mg l respectively which helped the pn a maintain a stable nlr of 0 21 0 24 kg n m3 d the influent cod was 40 1 44 6 mg l and the cod nh4 n was 1 14 1 44 indicating that a stable influent was fed to the pn a throughout the entire operation period the nitrogen removal performance at the three phases is shown in fig 2 and table 2 in phase ⅰ of 25 c the ifas pn a system achieved stable nitrogen removal the removal efficiencies of tn nre and nh4 n are were 79 4 3 0 and 81 3 6 7 corresponding to the effluent tn and nh4 n of 7 3 1 2 and 6 2 1 6 mg l respectively the in situ ratio of aor anr was 0 65 0 72 indicating that a good balance between aob and anaob was maintained at the do of 0 1 0 8 mg l and the mean afr of 64 5 l min at 25 c on d58 the operating temperature was switched to 20 c to start phase ⅱ since microbial activities tend to be suppressed at a lower temperature the afr was temporarily reduced to 52 l min to avoid over aeration to grow nob on d59 an accumulation of nh4 n of 11 6 mg l was observed and no residual no2 n in the effluent indicating that nitritation had become the rate limiting step of the pn a therefore the afr was gradually increased and reached to 66 5 l min on d64 which was followed by a gradual increase in nre from 60 to a peak of 84 4 thereafter the ifas pn a stably operated for the rest of phase ⅱ with a mean nre of 75 7 9 2 and an are of 86 4 7 5 accompanied by the effluent tn and nh4 n of 9 7 3 6 and 4 7 2 6 mg l on d109 the operating temperature was further reduced to 15 c like the temperature transition at 20 c the afr was temporarily adjusted to 52 l min on d110 an increase in residual nh4 n of 10 9 mg l was observed indicating that the aeration was insufficient to oxidize the influent nh4 n meanwhile about 2 5 mg l of no2 n was detected in the effluent indicating that anaob activity may also have been suppressed thus the afr was carefully increased with maintaining the balance between aor and anr from d115 the nre gradually increased and then reached a high level of 72 81 with an afr of about 63 l min however from d123 to d129 the malfunction of the online do sensor resulted in higher than actual do values being displayed these incorrect do values led to confusion in adjusting afr resulting in an insufficient air supply and the consequent accumulation of nh4 n therefore the nre significantly reduced to 49 58 after the do sensor was working normally again a stable nre and are of 65 9 8 8 and 75 6 11 6 and a stable effluent tn and nh4 n of 12 0 2 8 and 7 4 2 3 mg l were achieved during the remainder of phase ⅲ additionally the pilot ifas pn a plant also has the ability to remove org c fig 3 and table 2 approximately 13 7 20 9 mg l cod and 5 1 6 8 mg l bod5 were eliminated during the operation period corresponding to removal efficiencies of cod and bod5 of 32 6 50 4 and 36 8 59 2 respectively in addition no no3 n was detected in the effluent fig 2 c indicating that the denitrification existing in the pn a reactor and helped to improve the effluent quality by removing org c and nitrogen simultaneously moreover as shown in fig 3 b the actual removed cod was much higher than that calculated based on the removed no3 n 2 86 g cod for removing 1 g no3 n via denitrification rong et al 2022a it can therefore be inferred that the ordinary heterotrophic organism oho heterotrophic bacteria hb except denitrifying bacteria was also present and that it enhanced the ability to remove cod as a result the pilot scale ifas pn a plant actually functioned as a simultaneous partial nitritation anammox denitrification and cod oxidation snadco system an overview of the treatment performance of the ifas pn a is that the mean nre decreased with temperature drops especially when the temperature lowered to 15 c which was similar to the result of a previous study akaboci et al 2018 in addition org c was efficiently removed in the ifas pn a at the three temperature phases as a result the effluent tn nh4 n cod and bod5 of this pilot plant were lower than 15 10 35 and 10 mg l respectively 3 2 temperature effects on the microbial treatment capacity the temperature effects on the treatment capacity of different microorganisms and their distribution in the ifas pn a system were understood by bmtpt the aob and anaob treatment capacities of independent suspended sludge independent carriers and mixtures suspended sludge carriers were defined as aor sludge and anr sludge aor carrier and anr carrier and aor mixture and anr mixture respectively as shown in fig 4 a for the temperature effects on the overall treatment capacity both aor mixture and anr mixture decreased with temperature drops the mean aor mixture of the stable period was 0 26 0 17 and 0 14 kg n m3 d and the mean anr mixture was 0 81 0 73 and 0 40 kg n m3 d at 25 20 and 15 c respectively the anr mixture was consistently higher than the nlr of 0 21 0 24 kg n m3 d at the three phases indicating that the treatment capacity of anaob always meets the treatment requirement the aor mixture was lower than the nlr at 20 c and 15 c however considering that only about 55 of nh4 n was needed to be converted to no2 n of the pn a reaction wu et al 2021 thus the aor mixture at 25 c and 20 c still meet the nlr requirement and the low aor mixture at 15 c was the reason for the poorer nre in phase ⅲ in addition fig 2 e shows that the aor mixture and anr mixture both decreased sharply during the temperature transitions when the operating temperature was switched to 20 c and 15 c the aor mixture dropped to 0 1 and 0 1 kg n m3 d and the anr mixture dropped to 0 45 and 0 29 kg n m3 d immediately this result was in accordance with the sudden reduction in nitrogen removal during the temperature transitions on d58 and d109 indicating that the sudden temperature shocks have a significant impact on the activity of aob and anaob it should be noted that the nre rebounded rapidly after a short adaptation period fig 2 b suggesting that a long term adaption would be beneficial in improving microbial activity de clippeleir et al 2013 moreover according to the results of the ex situ tests the nob activity was 0 at the three phases indicating that nob was well suppressed in this ifas pn a the results of the temperature effects on the treatment capacities of independent suspended sludge and biofilm carriers are shown in fig 4 b and c as shown in fig 4 c the anr carrier was 0 77 0 74 and 0 39 kg n m3 d which accounted for 99 2 98 6 and 93 7 of the total mixture anr at 25 20 and 15 c respectively this result demonstrated that the biofilm carriers were mainly responsible for anammox in this ifas pn a system the anr sludge was 0 006 0 011 and 0 027 kg n m3 d at 25 20 and 15 c respectively although the anr sludge can be considered negligible when compared with the anr carrier the increasing trend of anr sludge suggests that a little bit of biofilm may be detached from carriers at lower temperatures aor was found both for the suspended sludge and the biofilm carriers as shown in fig 4 b the aor sludge was 0 174 0 099 and 0 086 kg n m3 d and the aor carrier was 0 067 0 045 and 0 084 kg n m3 d at 25 20 and 15 c respectively this indicates that some aob existing in the biofilm and that the carriers therefore also contributed to nitritation noting that the aor sludge was much higher than the aor carrier at 25 c and 20 c whereas their values were very close at 15 c indicating that the suspended sludge dominated the nitritation in this ifas pn a but the importance of carriers in nitritation increased with temperature drops thus on the basis of the above results it can be inferred that the anaob was well enriched by the carriers as biofilm while the aob was mainly distributed in the suspended sludge as flocs 3 3 retention and characteristics of the suspended sludge and biofilm in this research no sludge was discharged from ifas pn a throughout the entire operation period the suspended sludge of the pn a reactor was well maintained at a mean mlss of 2050 2130 and 2340 mg l and a mean mlvss of 1730 1760 and 1990 mg l during phase ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ respectively the ratio of mlvss mlss was about 0 85 since the retention of suspended sludge is closely related to settleability the characteristics of the suspended sludge at different temperatures were determined as shown in fig 5 with the operating temperature dropped from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c the sv30 of the suspended sludge reduced from 94 to 79 to 68 and the settling velocity calculated in 30 min settlement increased from 0 0036 to 0 0115 to 0 0187 m h respectively the svi calculated for the three temperature phases were 458 371 and 290 ml g the results of the psd analysis show an increase in the particle size of the suspended sludge with temperature drops the mean sizes were 45 0 61 6 and 72 4 μm and the d50 were 31 7 42 7 and 48 6 μm at 25 20 and 15 c respectively it should be noted however that although the settleability of suspended sludge was improved at lower temperatures it is still worse than the conventional activated sludge for which svi 300 ml g is generally regarded to sludge bulking the photographs of the carriers are given in fig 6 compared with the virgin carriers and the carriers of the start up period obvious dark red color biofilm was observed on the carries of the three temperature phases the ifas pn a was long term operated at 25 c before this research the overall operation time exceeded 400 days was long enough for the growth of biofilm however the biofilm in this research was only distributed on the interior surface of the carriers and much thinner than that of the same carries in a side stream lab scale reactor operating for 156 days qian et al 2022 of which the hollow holes of the carriers were almost filled by the biofilm this difference may be attributed to the low nlr and the strong hydraulic flush in this research note that no obvious biofilm shedding or detachment occurred as the temperatures were decreased this is evidence that the thin biofilm was dense and solid enough to cope with the strong hydraulic flush to retain the biomass in addition the color of the biofilm in this study was not as bright as that observed for the side stream process qian et al 2022 according to the result of a previous study the dark red color was attributed to the growth of hb cao et al 2019 comparing with the biofilm at phase ⅰ and ⅱ the grey sludge was found on the carriers of phase ⅲ indicating that more hb may grow on the carriers at the low temperature of 15 c 3 4 microbial community at seasonal temperatures the microbial communities of the suspended sludge flocs and the biofilm at the three phases are shown at the phylum level in fig 7 a and b and at the genus level in fig 7 c only the group with a relative abundance of 1 in one sample is presented at the phylum level a total of 25 groups and 26 groups were found in the flocs and the biofilm respectively and the most abundant phyla were proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes and planctomycetes demonstrating the high consistency between the flocs and biofilm with the temperature dropped from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c in the flocs the proteobacteria increased from 36 5 to 45 6 to 50 8 the chloroflexi increased from 12 9 to 18 5 to 22 3 the bacteroidetes decreased from 22 6 to 12 4 to 10 2 and the planctomycetes changed from 8 2 to 8 7 to 3 4 respectively whereas in the biofilm their relative abundance was in the range of 19 6 22 8 21 2 28 4 12 1 16 8 and 10 1 14 5 respectively this result indicates that the microbial community of biofilm is much more stable than that of flocs it should be noted that a high abundance of chloroflexi was observed according to the previous literature the chloroflexi likely worked as the backbone of biofilm xu et al 2019 in addition the chloroflexia was filamentous bacteria wang et al 2021 its high abundance in flocs may the reason for the poor settleability of the suspended sludge at the genus level aob was the dominate group in flocs including the nitrosomonas 16 4 3 9 3 5 uncultured f chitinophagaceae 5 2 5 9 5 5 uncultured f pirellulaceae 1 6 0 9 1 1 and niabella 1 1 0 9 1 3 meanwhile the aob of the nitrosomonas 5 6 1 0 1 0 and uncultured f chitinophagaceae 4 9 6 2 4 9 were found in biofilm these results demonstrate that both the suspended sludge and the biofilm carriers contributed to the nitritation with the greatest contribution from the suspended sludge which is consistent with the results of bmtpt it should be noted however that there was a significant reduction in nitrosomonas at 20 c and 15 c while the uncultured f chitinophagaceae was stable in the three phases together with the ex situ aor results in section 3 2 it confirms that the reduction of nitrosomonas is the reason for the deteriorated aor sludge and the uncultured f chitinophagaceae was important for the ifas pn a to process nitritation at lower temperatures the main anaob genera were candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia which were also the dominant anaob community of the seeding sludge wu et al 2021 in the biofilm the relative abundances of candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were 6 5 4 2 and 7 6 and 3 3 2 6 and 2 8 at 25 20 and 15 c respectively the higher relative abundance of candidatus brocadia was attributed to its better survivability than other anaob under the condition with cod and to the habit of growing on biofilm cui et al 2021 in the suspended sludge only a tiny proportion of candidatus kuenenia was found 0 1 this result is consistent with the result of the bmtpt and confirms that the anaob was successfully enriched on the carriers this result was in line with that of a previous ifas pn a reactor veuillet et al 2014 the db was also detected in the flocs and the biofilm in the flocs the db included hyphomicrobium 4 6 3 7 4 9 uncultured o phycisphaerales 3 0 6 6 1 3 dok59 2 6 4 7 5 6 uncultured f sinobacteraceae 2 4 1 2 0 9 paracoccus 2 2 0 2 0 3 and uncultured f caldilineaceae 2 1 4 1 7 4 in the biofilm the db included dok59 4 7 10 9 1 uncultured o phycisphaerales 2 7 2 3 1 9 uncultured o solibacterales 1 9 2 0 2 0 and hyphomicrobium 1 7 1 0 1 1 these results confirm the presence of denitrification in the pn a and explain why no3 n was not detected in the effluent in addition the dok59 may be a candidatus desulfobacillus via the sequence alignment in this research the high and increasing abundance of dok59 was attributed to the increase in influent s2 because more h2s was dissolved in the anmbr effluent at lower temperatures rong et al 2022b in addition oho were also found in the flocs and the biofilm in the flocs the uncultured o gca004 4 6 3 1 2 9 and the verrucomicrobium 0 2 1 7 1 7 functioned for carbohydrate degradation the uncultured f saprospiraceae 3 8 3 8 2 6 functioned for protein degradation in the biofilm the uncultured o gca004 7 5 6 4 6 7 the uncultured f s47 6 2 10 8 10 7 the uncultured o sphingobacteriales 4 0 4 2 3 6 and the uncultured f saprospiraceae 2 6 0 2 0 2 were detected the existence of oho is evidence that cod removal in the ifas pn a was not merely due to the denitrifiers and also explains the much higher actual cod removal than the theoretical cod removal calculated based on the removed no3 n it should be noted that nob nitrospira was only detected on the biofilm with a relative abundance of 0 1 0 2 this result suggested that nob was well suppressed in the ifas pn a which was in line with the result of bmtpt interestingly methylosinus one of the methane oxidizing bacteria mob was found in the ifas pn a and its relative abundance in flocs increased from 1 7 to 5 4 to 6 0 with the temperature dropped from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c this is because more ch4 was dissolved in the anmbr effluent at lower temperatures which promoted the growth of mob in the suspended sludge by contrast the methylosinus on the biofilm was much lower than that in the flocs and was stable in the range of 1 1 1 7 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of ifas pn a offsets the adverse effects of temperature drop in this research a 1 670 l ifas pn a system was investigated for the treatment of anaerobically pretreated mww at seasonal temperatures of 25 20 and 15 c the above analyses clearly show that the biomass was efficiently retained by the sedimentation tank and the carriers and the different microbial communities were segregated in flocs and biofilm which effectively offsets the adverse impacts of temperature drop and hydraulic flush to maintain an excellent removal of n and org c the effluent tn and cod meet the requirements of the effluent discharged standards tn 15 mg l and cod 35 mg l indicating that ifas pn a is a successful process for the treatment of mww in temperate climates however it should be noted that ifas pn a is a complex system on the one hand different microbes aob anaob and hb db and oho were found in the system and were distributed in the suspended sludge and biofilm simultaneously on the other hand the microbial communities and treatment capacities as well as biomass characteristics were affected by temperature drops therefore it is expected that there is a complicated interaction among the microbial communities and with the flocs and biofilm a schematic diagram is provided in fig 8 to illustrate the interaction and function mechanism of the ifas pn a as an ifas system the oxygen transfer rate of the biofilm is much slower than that of the flocs veuillet et al 2014 under a condition with intermittent aeration the anoxic environment was formed easily on the bottom layer of biofilm which favored the growth of anaob this may explain why the anaob was found in the carriers only while the aob existed on carriers and suspended sludge on the basis of the biofilm structure reported in previous studies and the habits of the microbial communities it can be inferred that aob and hb were at the surface layer of the biofilm to obtain do while anaob was at the bottom layer of the biofilm to circumvent do gustavsson et al 2020 poot et al 2016 vlaeminck et al 2010 winkler et al 2011 however in the suspended sludge aob and hb mixed together forming the flocs under such a spatial microbial distribution the influent nh4 n and do contacted the flocs first in the ifas system at higher temperatures of 20 c due to the faster microbial activity of aob and the rapid mass transfer rates of the oxygen and nh4 n the aob in suspended sludge aob sludge efficiently converts the nh4 n to no2 n meanwhile the thin biofilm enhanced the mass transfer rates and accessibility of substrates therefore the nh4 n and no2 n can rapidly penetrate the biofilm and reach to the bottom layer and then be removed by anaob on carriers anaob carrier therefore at temperatures of 20 c the suspended sludge and carriers were responsible for nitritation and anammox respectively however at the low temperature of 15 c the aor sludge and the mass transfer rates of oxygen and nh4 n were reduced resulting in the aob sludge cannot convert the nh4 n in time resulting in the aob on carriers aob carrier has the opportunity for capturing nh4 n to process nitritation therefore the aob carrier and the aob sludge complete the nitritation together and the importance of the aob carrier increased at lower temperatures 4 2 insight into the decrease in aor and the suppression of nob in this research insufficient nitritation was the rate limiting step in the pn a process resulting in a decrease in nitrogen removal at 15 c this phenomenon was also found in other pn a studies de clippeleir et al 2013 lotti et al 2015b and the possible reasons are as follows it has been proven that aob was sensitive to temperature drop and the activity of aob was easily suppressed at lower temperatures wang et al 2021 in this research the ifas pn a worked as a snadco system where aob has to compete with oho for oxygen since about 37 5 43 5 mg l cod was contained in the influent the oho outcompeted the aob under this org c rich condition de clippeleir et al 2013 moreover in order to maintain sufficient biomass sludge was not extracted from the sedimentation tank during the operation due to the fixed sludge return ratio and the increased settleability of flocs a large quantity of suspended sludge was trapped in the sedimentation tank under the anoxic condition thus a considerable portion of aob became aged or died resulting in a reduction of the aor sludge in addition the irregular sludge extraction resulted in long solids retention time 100 days which aggravated the cell lysis to release organics and further conducive to the growth of oho this is why a high abundance of microbial associated with carbohydrate and protein degradation was observed at lower temperatures by contrast the aob carrier was almost unaffected by temperature drops this was attributed to the aob carrier on the surface of the biofilm this allowed the aob carrier always presented in the pn a reactor to access oxygen and also to be replaced by new energetic microbes due to the hydraulic flush in time nob was well suppressed in this ifas pn a system different from a pure pn a process since the presence of db in the reactor the 0 no3 of the effluent results in the failure to determine the reaction rate of nob however the result of high throughput sequencing showed that only a tiny abundance of nob on the carriers demonstrated that the successful nob controlling strategy was adopted in this research as mentioned this pilot scale pn a plant was started up with a strategy of in situ nob elimination by fa and fna wu et al 2021 and was long term operated with the synthetic substrate 3000 to 100 mg nh4 n l at 25 c to grow biofilm therefore the nob had been efficiently eliminated by exposing to a long term high fa and fna before this research in this research the ifas pn a operating with an intermittent aeration mode since the nob has a longer lag time than aob during the transition from anoxic to aerobic conditions zhang et al 2019 it was inhibited at the transit anoxia during the daily operation moreover aob nob and oho are competitors for oxygen it has been reported that the binding capacity of aob towards oxygen is stronger than that of nob resulting in higher oxygen availability for aob than that for nob cao et al 2017 in addition from the perspective of microbial distribution nob resided more internally than aob in an ifas pn a and are more prone to oxygen limitation vlaeminck et al 2010 lotti et al 2014c in an aeration cycle of this pilot plant the instantaneous do was usually 0 8 mg l during the aeration on and was 0 during the aeration off the maximum do was still lower than the half saturation coefficient of nob to do 1 2 1 5 mg l picioreanu et al 1997 as a result under the condition of intermittent aeration and limited oxygen nob was efficiently suppressed in the ifas pn a 4 3 the contribution and implication of this research this research is the first ifas type pn a process at such a large pilot scale 1670 l and changing temperatures thus the results of this research are worthy of comparison with other type pn a studies to provide references for developing the mainstream pn a ifas pn a is a hybrid system including suspended sludge and biofilm since a large amount of aob existing in suspended sludge to enhance nitritation malovanyy et al 2015b the nre of ifas is usually much higher than the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr process and thus could be operated in short hrt to meet the requirement of mainstream applications malovanyy et al 2015a similarly compared with the floc type pn a ifas pn a has an advantage in retaining biomass especially the precious anaob by biofilm this means that the ifas pn a usually has a higher mlvss than the floc type pn a at hydraulic flush and could be operated at a high nlr and volumetric loading rate guo et al 2020b the granule type pn a is characterized by higher mlvss and excellent settleability which has the potential to be operated with a small sedimentation tank and short hrt high nlr however different from the ifas pn a has a strong tolerance to the fluctuation of operation parameters the granulation has strict requirements of ph hydraulic condition and additional materials chen et al 2022 therefore the ifas pn a has better operability than the granule type pn a in daily operations most importantly the nrr of ifas pn a was 0 15 0 18 kg n m3 d in this research which is much higher than that of conventional nitrification denitrification in activated sludge of 0 05 0 1 kg n m3 d cao et al 2017 indicating that ifas pn a meets the treatment requirements for the practical applications moreover in this research the pn a worked as the post treatment unit of anmbr the excellent effluent quality of the pn a together with the excellent energy efficiency of the anmbr demonstrating the strong feasibility of the mainstream anmbr pn a as the alternative to conventional aerobic process in addition it should be emphasized that some key points required special attention when operating the mainstream ifas pn a due to the poor settleability of suspended sludge the ifas pn a systems require a higher standard of sedimentation tank to avoid biomass washout to avoid the reduction of aob abundance and to improve the treatment capacity of aob the suspended sludge should be extracted regularly from the system to eliminate the aged biomass and a much higher sludge return ratio was needed at lower temperatures 15 c most importantly the ifas pn a has a poor phosphorus p removal 2 table 2 in order to meet the discharged standards of p a post treatment of pn a effluent was also required 5 conclusions in this research a pilot scale ifas pn a succeed in the treatment of actual mww pretreated by anmbr at decreasing temperatures from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c leading to the following conclusions 1 under the nlr of 0 21 0 24 kg n m3 d the nre decreased from 79 4 to 75 7 to 65 9 when the operating temperature dropped from 25 c to 20 c to 15 c respectively the insufficient treatment capacity of aob was blamed for the sharp reduction of nre at 15 c 2 anaob were enriched in biofilm and retained by carriers aob were mainly distributed in flocs and retained by the sedimentation tank the successful biomass retention and microbial segregation compensate for the impacts of low temperature 3 only a tiny relative abundance of nob 0 1 0 2 was found in the system demonstrated that nob was well suppressed by the strategy of intermittent aeration 4 min on and 1 min off and low do about 0 8 mg l for long term operation 4 the presence of db and oho improved the overall removal of tn and cod the good effluent quality tn 15 mg l cod 35 mg l indicated that the ifas pn a can be applied for the treatment of actual mww when the temperature 15 c declaration of competing interest the

15489,despite the extensive study of tetracycline photolysis in aquatic environments the phototransformation of tetracycline and its metabolites under natural day night succession has not been examined in this study we investigated tetracycline photolysis and associated ecotoxicity in two natural surface waters and one artificial ultrapure water under simulated day night cycling over two days previously unrecognized and highly ph and temperature dependent dark interconversions of tetracycline metabolites were observed the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry analysis identified a range of isomerized hydroxylated demethylated deaminated and open ring photoproducts the hydrolysis of tetracycline isotetracycline and several intermediate products was proposed as the major mechanism for the observed dark transformations exposure studies employing escherichia coli indicated that although the tetracycline degradation products had lower bacterial toxicities than the parent compound increasing toxicity with irradiation time after the near complete degradation of the parent compound in natural waters implied that product mixtures retain ecotoxicity the dark transformations also affected the bacterial toxicity and fluorescence properties of irradiated tetracycline solutions overall this study provides new insights into the photochemical behavior of tetracycline and its associated ecological risk in aquatic environments graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords tetracycline photolysis metabolites dark transformation day night succession ecotoxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tetracyclines have been widely administered to humans and animals mostly livestock since their discovery in the 1940s chopra et al 1992 livermore 2005 meagher et al 2005 roberts 1996 tetracyclines are broad spectrum antibiotics that are active against bacteria by preventing the attachment of aminoacyl trna to ribosomal acceptor sites roberts 1996 schnappinger and hillen 1996 according to the u s food and drug administration tetracyclines are the largest class of antibiotics used in livestock production cabello et al 2013 u s food and drug administration fda 2017 however large fractions 40 80 of tetracyclines administered in livestock feeds are excreted unchanged in manure and urine aga et al 2005 halling sørensen et al 2001 jacobsen et al 2004a kay et al 2004 as a consequence of the land application of animal manure and irrigation with reclaimed water tetracyclines are introduced into the environment aga et al 2005 chee sanford et al 2001 jacobsen et al 2004b given that anthropogenically discharged tetracyclines could exert selection pressure on indigenous bacterial communities to develop antibiotic resistance chen et al 2017b chen et al 2015 assessing the fate of tetracycline in the environment is a priority despite the widespread use of tetracycline in livestock production evidence demonstrating the occurrence of high levels of tetracycline in the environment is relatively scarce lindsey et al 2001 luo et al 2011 xu et al 2021 potentially owing to the rapid transformation processes of tetracycline indeed many studies have demonstrated that photolysis in sunlit surface waters is a major degradation route for tetracyclines with a degradation rate that is highly dependent on the temperature ph ion strength and organic matter content of the water davies et al 1979 jiao et al 2008 niu et al 2013b werner et al 2006 it was also relatively clear that the direct excitation of tetracycline molecules by sunlight and the subsequent formation of highly reactive oxygen species e g 1o2 and o2 that damage tetracycline was the main photodegradation mechanism chen et al 2008 chen et al 2011 niu et al 2013b furthermore indirect photolysis initiated by natural aquatic constituents such as humic acid and nitrate also contributed to tetracycline phototransformation in natural waters li and hu 2016 niu et al 2013b the reported tetracycline photoproducts include the loss of nh2 from the 2 carboxamide group and demethylation from the dimethylamine group followed by the loss of oh at c3 anhydrotetracycline epitetracycline and some small molecules eichhorn and aga 2004 halling sørensen et al 2002 hasan et al 1985 niu et al 2013b although tetracycline photolysis has been extensively investigated to the best of our knowledge the photochemical fate of tetracycline and its photodegradation products during day night cycling in natural water bodies has not been examined conflicting results have been presented in the literature regarding the influence of photolysis on the ecotoxicity of tetracyclines wammer et al 2011 found that tetracycline lost its toxicity to escherichia coli and vibrio fischers upon sunlight irradiation due to damage to the molecular core structure however other studies demonstrated that certain photoproducts still possessed the key parts of molecules that conferred tetracyclines bacteriostatic activities thus photolysis could not fully eliminate the ecotoxicity of this class of antibiotics davies et al 1979 han et al 2020 in addition the potential synergistic effect among different products or natural water components and products may also confer ecotoxicity to the irradiated tetracycline solution correspondingly the increased toxicity of a tetracycline solution to luminescent v fischers upon simulated sunlight irradiation was reported by jiao et al 2008 likewise to date no study has examined the bacterial toxicity of a tetracycline solution during day night succession to fill these knowledge gaps the photolysis of tetracycline in aqueous solutions was revisited to get closer to the real aquatic environment and solar light conditions tetracycline photolysis experiments were conducted in simulated day night cycling in collected natural surface waters for comparison tetracycline photolysis was conducted in parallel using ultrapure water during the entire reaction period the transformation dynamics of tetracycline and its photoproducts and the bacteriostatic activity of the irradiated solutions on e coli were systematically examined in addition tetracycline metabolites were identified using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry hplc ms ms and the potential mechanisms associated with the observed dark transformations were elucidated the results obtained in this study will improve our understanding of the photochemical fate of tetracycline in surface water and provide fundamental information for risk assessments of tetracycline and its photometabolites 2 experimental section 2 1

bobbitt and betts 1992 tian et al 2013 selected physicochemical properties including the ph inorganic ions and carbon content of the collected water samples were measured and are summarized in table s1 in the supporting information si 2 2 tetracycline photolysis under the simulated day night cycle tetracycline photolysis experiments were conducted using an xpa 7 merry go round photochemical reactor xujiang electromechanical inc nanjing china equipped with a water refrigerated system that can control the reaction temperature at different levels a commercially available 500 w xenon arc lamp newport corporation was used as the light source and was positioned in a cylindrical quartz cold trap at the center of the reactor the light source irradiation spectrum was measured as shown in figure s1 in the si to mimic natural sunlight irradiation of surface waters light with wavelengths 260 nm was filtered with pyrex glass ge et al 2010 tian et al 2015 the light intensity on the surface

prepared in milliq ultrapure water or two natural freshwaters were irradiated with simulated sunlight at 25 c for 12 h subsequently the reacted solutions were immediately covered with aluminum foil and incubated at 25 c for 12 h this sequence of light dark cycling experiments was conducted over a total period of 48 h simulating two days during the entire experimental period both light and dark conditions 1 ml of the solution was decanted every 2 h from the reacted solution to measure the tetracycline concentration and the transformation dynamics of the photometabolites using waters alliance

cycling reaction to characterize the photolysis products a day night cycling experiment was conducted again the samples from time points at 12 24 36 and 48 h were passed through c18 spe cartridges to enrich the photodegradation products the methanol eluents were transferred to 2 5 ml autosampler vials for immediate analysis via hplc ms ms to decipher the potential reaction mechanism under dark conditions tetracycline photolysis was first conducted at 25 c for 4 h and then the irradiated solutions were immediately stored in the dark at 4 15 25 and 35 c for different times to explore the temperature effect or at same temperature 25 c but at different phs of 4 0 7 0 and 8 0 adjusted with hydrochloric acid to examine the influence of ph additionally considering h2o2 is a known photoproduct of the solar irradiation of natural surface waters and the direct photolysis of tetracycline in pure water chen et al 2008 chen et al 2012 cooper and zika 1983 cooper et al 1988 lópez peñalver et al 2010 the potential role of h2o2 in the dark reaction was also examined by spiking the irradiated solutions with 10 mm catalase used to decompose h2o2 and immediately incubating these at 25 c in dark for different times the dynamics of the products were monitored using a hplc pda analysis 2 4 analytical methods the degradation products were characterized using an hplc qtof ms system agilent 1260 infinity hplc system connected with an ab sciex triple quadrupole time of flight 5600 mass spectrometer a c18 column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm atlantis t3 was used for separation at a flow rate of

in the collected solutions were measured using a multi n c 3100 total organic carbon toc analyzer analytikjena germany to examine the photomineralization of tetracycline and its photoproducts 3 results and discussion 3 1 rapid degradation of tetracycline upon sunlight irradiation tetracycline photolysis during day night cycling was conducted in milliq ultrapure water xianlin pond water and jiuxiang river water a 500 w xenon lamp with a 260 nm glass filter restricting the transmission of wavelengths below 260 nm was used to mimic the solar irradiation at the earth s surface as shown in supplemental figure s1 the spectrum in this study spanned the uv b 280 320 nm uv a 320 400 nm visible 400 700 nm and near infrared 700 1000 nm wavelengths of sunlight tetracycline was quickly depleted in the three water samples upon simulated sunlight irradiation fig 1 after 12 h irradiation up to 89 7 0 2 95 9 0 1 and 92 0 0 1 of the tetracycline was degraded in the ultrapure pond and river water respectively the rapid photolysis of tetracycline was also supported by the uv vis absorption spectrum as shown in figure s2 the absorption spectrum of tetracycline contained two bands in the regions of 230 320 nm and 320 370 nm with peak wavelengths of ca 270 nm and 360 nm the absorption maximum at 270 nm was attributed to the absorption of the chromophore formed by the amide diketone and hydroxyl groups of the a ring of tetracycline whereas the absorption at 360 nm was due to the chromophore of the bcd rings of tetracycline which are made up of the phenyl hydroxytone group found in the carbonyl and ketone groups nelson et al 2001 both absorption regions fall within the spectrum of solar irradiation making tetracycline is photoactive the two natural surface waters had significantly higher tetracycline degradation rates than ultrapure water annova test p 0 05 probably because these contained diverse natural photosensitizing materials such as dom no3 and no2 as shown in table s1 which can directly or indirectly promote chemical degradation by producing light induced reactive oxygen species lópez peñalver et al 2010 werner et al 2006 contrary to the total ion and carbon contents in the two natural waters table s1 tetracycline had a higher photolysis rate in the pond water than in the river water this might be due to the quenching effect of excessively high concentrations of ions or organic matter which usually decreases the production of active radicals and depresses pollutant photolysis awfa et al 2020 chen et al 2011 comparing the uv vis spectrum of tetracycline with the major degradation products in figure s2 we found that irradiation destroyed the core structure of tetracycline especially the bcd rings of the molecule because most products except for one product in ultrapure water lost the specific absorption of these rings i e 360 nm region collectively these results confirmed that tetracycline in the sunlit aquatic environment is quite unstable and that natural aquatic constituents dramatically affect tetracycline photolysis 3 2 unrecognized dark transformations of tetracycline degradation products from the hplc chromatograms more product peaks were observed in ultrapure water than in the two natural waters fig 1 probably due to different degrees of tetracycline degradation in natural waters vs ultrapure water it is reasonable to assume that compared with ultrapure water the higher level of tetracycline degradation in natural waters was because only photodegradation pathways exist for the former whereas degradation in the latter involves both direct and indirect pathways accordingly this would cause greater residues of the intermediates in ultrapure water and thus more product peaks on the lc chromatogram according to the retention time and uv vis absorption spectrum these products were named products a to g over the first 12 h of irradiation tetracycline in the three water samples rapidly decayed to residual levels with most of the primary products continuously increasing in concentration fig 1 however product c in natural waters and products b and c in ultrapure water only increased in the first 4 h and then rapidly decreased with time until 12 h interestingly this kind of decrease continuously proceeded throughout the first period of dark incubation 12 24 h demonstrating that some photoproducts are unstable after formation and may undergo non photochemical processes e g hydrolysis in the dark meanwhile during the dark period of 12 24 h other products increased in concentration such as products a and d in ultrapure water and products a and g in natural waters demonstrating the existence of interconversions of metabolites under dark conditions to the best of our knowledge these dark transformations of tetracycline metabolites have rarely been reported in the second day night cycle most product peaks decreased to undetectable levels with increasing time note that product a in natural waters remained quite stable over the entire experimental period highlighting its potential photostability this was consistent with the absorption maxima of the product at 250 nm and 300 nm which are no longer completely within the irradiation spectrum of the xenon lamp compare figure s1 and figure s2 moreover unlike its photostability in natural waters this product in ultrapure water exhibited a continuous decrease during the second irradiation period of 24 36 h fig 1 implying that natural components in surface waters may also prevent further photolysis of this metabolite 3 3 identification of tetracycline degradation products transformation products at sampling times of 12 24 36 and 48 h were identified using hplc ms ms in general three steps were used to identify products with the acquired spectral data 1 identification of the molecular mass via the ms full scan 2 identification of potential transformation reactions via mass difference spectral and retention time comparisons and 3 identification of the reaction site via ionization behavior ms ms spectra retention time comparisons and external information using these strategies we were able to identify probable structures of products without standards in total 17 likely products were identified with relatively confidence levels of 2 and 3 the proposed formula structure retention time and confidence level of each product are summarized in table s2 and the detailed chromatograms and fragmentation patterns are presented in figure s3 more details on the product structure identification and confidence assignment are summarized in supplemental text s1 for simplicity we named the products based on abbreviated molecular ions as p474 p461 p445 p431 p417 p413 p396 p399 p398 p384 p360 p313 p301 p299 p212 1 p212 2 p203 and p187 among these 13 products were detected in ultrapure water whereas 15 products were detected in two natural waters fig 2 product p445 had the same molecular weight but different retention time 1 22 vs 2 20 min as tetracycline and was identified as isotetracycline an important tetracycline transformation product in basic solutions mohammed ali 2012 mojica et al 2014 zhong et al 2022 which was consistent with the ph of the solution 8 0 in this study some products were short written as m 29 for p474 m 16 for p461 m 14 for p431 m 28 for p417 m 32 for p413 m 47 for p398 and m 61 for p384 indicating a mass difference relative to tetracycline the product p474 may be generated via the hydroxylation of tetracycline and subsequently subjected to attack by reactive radicals huang et al 2021 yang et al 2018 product p461 was assigned as monohydroxylated tetracycline which was also observed in direct photolysis and advanced oxidation reactions of tetracycline in previous studies ji et al 2016b niu et al 2013b the products p431 and p417 were identified as 4 demethyltetracycline and 4 dedimethyltetracycline respectively these two products were generated by the sequential demethylation of the dimethylamino group of tetracycline further review of the literature also demonstrated that 4 demethyltetracycline exists extensively in various tetracycline degradation processes including photolysis jiao et al 2008 niu et al 2013b photocatalysis niu et al 2013a zhu et al 2013 and advanced oxidation processes chen et al 2017a ji et al 2016a the product p413 originated from the loss of the amino group and n methyl from the tetracycline molecule product p384 was attributed to the loss of the dimethylammonium and hydroxy groups from tetracycline and p398 was proposed as 4a 12a anhydro 4 oxo 4 dedimethylaminotetracycline a known photooxidation product of tetracycline in aqueous solutions davies et al 1979 in addition some low molecular weight products such as p360 p313 p301 p299 p212 p203 and p187 were also identified these compounds retain the partial skeletal structures of tetracycline and some of its intermediates such as isotetracycline fig 2 demonstrating their generation from further degradation of the metabolites finally photomineralization of tetracycline also occurred as indicated by the decreased organic carbon content in water during the irradiation periods figure s4 3 4 mechanism underlying dark transformation it is well known that h2o2 is an important photoproduct of the solar irradiation of natural waters cooper and zika 1983 cooper et al 1988 scully et al 1995 the associated mechanism involves the photooxidation of natural dom to generate o2 which is further converted to h2o2 during dismutation in ultrapure water the direct photolysis of tetracycline molecules to produce h2o2 has been widely reported chen et al 2008 chen et al 2012 lópez peñalver et al 2010 therefore it is believed that h2o2 was also formed in our system considering its relatively high oxidation capacity we initially hypothesized that the h2o2 formed during the photolysis process could lead to the observed transformations under subsequent dark conditions however the addition of catalase used to decompose h2o2 into the irradiated solution which was then incubated in the dark for different times did not affect the dark reactions of the major photoproducts figure s5 therefore the contribution of h2o2 to dark transformations was ruled out however we found that dark transformations increased with increasing ph fig 3 demonstrating that alkaline conditions favored dark transformations considering that the normal ph range in surface water systems is 6 5 8 5 the observed dark reactions of the tetracycline photoproducts are highly likely in natural surface waters in addition dark transformations also significantly increased with increasing incubation temperature fig 4 accordingly we expect the dark reactions of tetracycline photoproducts to be most prominent in warm sunlit waters whereas colder winterlike conditions should promote photoproduct stability the hplc ms ms analysis of the dynamics of tetracycline and its metabolites indicated that the observed dark reactions originated from several hydrolysis reactions first although we did not observe tetracycline dark degradation on the lc chromatograms the higher resolution hplc ms ms analysis demonstrated that tetracycline concentration actually decreased in the three waters during dark incubation periods figure s6 confirming the presence of tetracycline hydrolysis in the dark tetracycline is known to be unstable at high phs kühne et al 2000 mohammed ali 2012 so the relatively alkaline conditions in this study would benefit its hydrolysis similarly isotetracycline concentrations also decreased during the dark incubation period as shown in figure s6 and table s2 demonstrating that it also underwent dark hydrolysis recently zhong et al 2022 found that the major hydrolysis products of tetracycline in wastewater treatment plants included 4 epi tetracycline m z 445 1610 androtetracycline m z 427 1505 4 epi anhydrotetracycline m z 427 1505 p402 and several of our observed products including p417 p461 and p399 additionally we found that p461 p431 p398 p384 p313 and p301 also decreased during the two dark incubation periods table s2 in contrast p474 p417 p360 p212 1 and p212 2 increased in the dark previous studies have suggested that hydroxyl addition is a common phototransformation pathway and subsequent hydrolysis reactions often form secondary products ho 1986 zuo et al 2006 therefore p461 a monohydroxylated product may undergo a spontaneous dark hydrolysis reaction after its formation based on the opposite changing patterns of 4 demethyltetracycline p431 and 4 dedimethyltetracycline p417 in the dark we propose that 4 demethyltetracycline produced from the demethylation of the dimethylamino group of tetracycline during irradiation is structurally unstable and then undergoes another spontaneous demethylation reaction in the dark resulting in the generation of 4 dedimethyltetracycline products p398 p384 p313 and p301 might also have thermodynamically favored hydrolytic reactions in the dark with p212 1 p212 2 and p360 as the major hydrolysis products although we were unable to confirm this the hydrolysis reactions described above also explain the observed ph and temperature effects on dark transformation a lower ph would provide more protons to inhibit the base catalyzed hydrolysis reactions such as the hydrolysis of tetracycline isotetracycline and p431 the higher tem increased the reaction energy input to facilitate the hydrolysis reactions in this study the hplc pad analysis revealed 3 5 primary tetracycline products in the three water samples fig 1 and some products were confirmed by lc ms ms for example we propose products a c and f in fig 1 as p212 p431 and p417 respectively 3 5 ecotoxicity of irradiated tetracycline solutions the ecotoxicity of tetracycline and its products was predicted using qsar as shown in table 1 all compounds were classified into four categories according to the ghs united nations 2011 very toxic lc50 ec50 chv 1 mg l toxic 1 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 10 mg l harmful 10 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l and not harmful lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l all 17 products were predicted to cause some ecotoxicity and seven metabolites showed higher toxicity than tetracycline indicating that photolysis could enhance the toxicity of the irradiated solution for acute toxicity p299 was predicted to have the highest toxicity to fish and algae whereas p203 exhibited the highest toxicity to daphnids regarding chronic toxicity product p203 also showed the highest toxicity to daphnids and algae and p299 had the highest toxicity to fish although the qsar predicted toxicity requires further experimental validation it provides a preliminary assessment of the risk of tetracycline photoproducts furthermore a bacterial cultivation experiment was used to track the changing toxicity of the tetracycline solution during the simulated day night succession as shown in fig 5 during the first 12 h of irradiation the toxicity of the tetracycline solution in ultrapure water to e coli gradually decreased with time which was consistent with the corresponding tetracycline degradation in this water fig 1 however in the natural waters the toxicity only significantly decreased in first 4 h and then increased with increasing time to 12 h this corresponded with the fact that 90 of tetracycline in natural waters was degraded in the first 4 h fig 1 thus demonstrating that further photolysis increased the solution toxicity to e coli inconsistent observations between natural and artificial waters could be related to the discrepant intermediate products described above additionally aquatic components in natural waters might also cause combined toxicity with the degradation products afterwards dark incubation for 12 24 h generally decreased the toxicity of the three water samples confirming that the observed dark transformation reaction also affects the toxicity of the reacted solutions it is well known that the c4 dimethylaminon group is essential for tetracycline antibacterial activity schnappinger and hillen 1996 therefore it is assumed that the aforementioned dark demethylation of the c4 dimethylaminon group to produce 4 dedimethyltetracycline contributed to the observed toxicity reduction in the dark incubation period during the second irradiation period the solution toxicity decreased in the ultrapure water but did not change in the two natural waters during the last 12 h of incubation in the dark the reaction solutions from the three water samples showed similar toxicities together these results demonstrate that the observed dark reactions significantly affect the ecological risk of tetracycline and its photoproducts in addition the fluorescent changes of the three water bodies during the day night succession of tetracycline were monitored as detailed in supplemental text s2 and figures s7 s9 interestingly we also observed the rebound of fluorescence in natural waters in dark periods highlighting that the observed dark reaction could also affect the fluorescence of natural organic matter 4 conclusions this study is the first to investigate tetracycline photolysis in the natural diurnal cycle and found several overlooked hydrolysis reactions of tetracycline and its photoproducts in the dark the lc ms ms analysis identified a range of isomerized hydroxylated demethylated deaminated and open ring photoproducts exposure experiments indicated that photoproduct mixtures in natural waters retained their toxicity even after the near complete photolysis of tetracycline the observed dark reactions also affected the ecotoxicity and fluorescence properties of the irradiated solutions significant differences in the photoproducts and associated ecotoxicity between pure water and natural waters demonstrate the potential shortcomings of studying pollutant

15489,despite the extensive study of tetracycline photolysis in aquatic environments the phototransformation of tetracycline and its metabolites under natural day night succession has not been examined in this study we investigated tetracycline photolysis and associated ecotoxicity in two natural surface waters and one artificial ultrapure water under simulated day night cycling over two days previously unrecognized and highly ph and temperature dependent dark interconversions of tetracycline metabolites were observed the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry analysis identified a range of isomerized hydroxylated demethylated deaminated and open ring photoproducts the hydrolysis of tetracycline isotetracycline and several intermediate products was proposed as the major mechanism for the observed dark transformations exposure studies employing escherichia coli indicated that although the tetracycline degradation products had lower bacterial toxicities than the parent compound increasing toxicity with irradiation time after the near complete degradation of the parent compound in natural waters implied that product mixtures retain ecotoxicity the dark transformations also affected the bacterial toxicity and fluorescence properties of irradiated tetracycline solutions overall this study provides new insights into the photochemical behavior of tetracycline and its associated ecological risk in aquatic environments graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords tetracycline photolysis metabolites dark transformation day night succession ecotoxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tetracyclines have been widely administered to humans and animals mostly livestock since their discovery in the 1940s chopra et al 1992 livermore 2005 meagher et al 2005 roberts 1996 tetracyclines are broad spectrum antibiotics that are active against bacteria by preventing the attachment of aminoacyl trna to ribosomal acceptor sites roberts 1996 schnappinger and hillen 1996 according to the u s food and drug administration tetracyclines are the largest class of antibiotics used in livestock production cabello et al 2013 u s food and drug administration fda 2017 however large fractions 40 80 of tetracyclines administered in livestock feeds are excreted unchanged in manure and urine aga et al 2005 halling sørensen et al 2001 jacobsen et al 2004a kay et al 2004 as a consequence of the land application of animal manure and irrigation with reclaimed water tetracyclines are introduced into the environment aga et al 2005 chee sanford et al 2001 jacobsen et al 2004b given that anthropogenically discharged tetracyclines could exert selection pressure on indigenous bacterial communities to develop antibiotic resistance chen et al 2017b chen et al 2015 assessing the fate of tetracycline in the environment is a priority despite the widespread use of tetracycline in livestock production evidence demonstrating the occurrence of high levels of tetracycline in the environment is relatively scarce lindsey et al 2001 luo et al 2011 xu et al 2021 potentially owing to the rapid transformation processes of tetracycline indeed many studies have demonstrated that photolysis in sunlit surface waters is a major degradation route for tetracyclines with a degradation rate that is highly dependent on the temperature ph ion strength and organic matter content of the water davies et al 1979 jiao et al 2008 niu et al 2013b werner et al 2006 it was also relatively clear that the direct excitation of tetracycline molecules by sunlight and the subsequent formation of highly reactive oxygen species e g 1o2 and o2 that damage tetracycline was the main photodegradation mechanism chen et al 2008 chen et al 2011 niu et al 2013b furthermore indirect photolysis initiated by natural aquatic constituents such as humic acid and nitrate also contributed to tetracycline phototransformation in natural waters li and hu 2016 niu et al 2013b the reported tetracycline photoproducts include the loss of nh2 from the 2 carboxamide group and demethylation from the dimethylamine group followed by the loss of oh at c3 anhydrotetracycline epitetracycline and some small molecules eichhorn and aga 2004 halling sørensen et al 2002 hasan et al 1985 niu et al 2013b although tetracycline photolysis has been extensively investigated to the best of our knowledge the photochemical fate of tetracycline and its photodegradation products during day night cycling in natural water bodies has not been examined conflicting results have been presented in the literature regarding the influence of photolysis on the ecotoxicity of tetracyclines wammer et al 2011 found that tetracycline lost its toxicity to escherichia coli and vibrio fischers upon sunlight irradiation due to damage to the molecular core structure however other studies demonstrated that certain photoproducts still possessed the key parts of molecules that conferred tetracyclines bacteriostatic activities thus photolysis could not fully eliminate the ecotoxicity of this class of antibiotics davies et al 1979 han et al 2020 in addition the potential synergistic effect among different products or natural water components and products may also confer ecotoxicity to the irradiated tetracycline solution correspondingly the increased toxicity of a tetracycline solution to luminescent v fischers upon simulated sunlight irradiation was reported by jiao et al 2008 likewise to date no study has examined the bacterial toxicity of a tetracycline solution during day night succession to fill these knowledge gaps the photolysis of tetracycline in aqueous solutions was revisited to get closer to the real aquatic environment and solar light conditions tetracycline photolysis experiments were conducted in simulated day night cycling in collected natural surface waters for comparison tetracycline photolysis was conducted in parallel using ultrapure water during the entire reaction period the transformation dynamics of tetracycline and its photoproducts and the bacteriostatic activity of the irradiated solutions on e coli were systematically examined in addition tetracycline metabolites were identified using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry hplc ms ms and the potential mechanisms associated with the observed dark transformations were elucidated the results obtained in this study will improve our understanding of the photochemical fate of tetracycline in surface water and provide fundamental information for risk assessments of tetracycline and its photometabolites 2 experimental section 2 1

bobbitt and betts 1992 tian et al 2013 selected physicochemical properties including the ph inorganic ions and carbon content of the collected water samples were measured and are summarized in table

reactor xujiang electromechanical inc nanjing china equipped with a water refrigerated system that can control the reaction temperature at different levels a commercially available 500 w xenon arc lamp newport corporation was used as the light source and was positioned in a cylindrical quartz cold trap at the center of the reactor the light source irradiation spectrum was measured as shown in figure s1 in the si to mimic natural sunlight irradiation of surface waters light with wavelengths 260 nm was filtered with pyrex glass ge et al 2010 tian et al 2015 the light intensity on the surface

prepared in milliq ultrapure water or two natural freshwaters were irradiated with simulated sunlight at 25 c for 12 h subsequently the reacted solutions were immediately covered with aluminum foil and incubated at 25 c for 12 h this sequence of light dark cycling experiments was conducted over a total period of 48 h simulating two days during the entire experimental period both light and dark conditions 1 ml of the solution was decanted every 2 h from the reacted solution to measure the tetracycline concentration and the transformation dynamics of the photometabolites using waters alliance

experiment was repeated and each decanted solution at different sampling points was 100 times diluted into the lysogeny broth lb medium for culturing e coli dh5α 2 3 mechanistic study of the day night cycling reaction to characterize the photolysis products a day night cycling experiment was conducted again the samples from time points at 12 24 36 and 48 h were passed through c18 spe cartridges to enrich the photodegradation products the methanol eluents were transferred to 2 5 ml autosampler vials for immediate analysis via hplc ms ms to decipher the potential reaction mechanism under dark conditions tetracycline photolysis was first conducted at 25 c for 4 h and then the irradiated solutions were immediately stored in the dark at 4 15 25 and 35 c for different times to explore the temperature effect or at same temperature 25 c but at different phs of 4 0 7 0 and 8 0 adjusted with hydrochloric acid to examine the influence of ph additionally considering h2o2 is a known photoproduct of the solar irradiation of natural surface waters and the direct photolysis of tetracycline in pure water chen et al 2008 chen et al 2012 cooper and zika 1983 cooper et al 1988 lópez peñalver et al 2010 the potential role of h2o2 in the dark reaction was also examined by spiking the irradiated solutions with 10 mm catalase used to decompose h2o2 and immediately incubating these at 25 c in dark for different times the dynamics of the products were monitored using a hplc pda analysis 2 4 analytical methods the degradation products were characterized using an hplc qtof ms system agilent 1260 infinity hplc system connected with an ab sciex triple quadrupole time of flight 5600 mass spectrometer a c18 column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm atlantis t3 was used for separation at a flow rate of

toxicities were classified based on the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals united nations 2011 as shown in table 1 2 5 dissolved organic matter photochemical behavior during the simulated day night cycle after repeating the aforementioned tetracycline day night cycling experiments 3 ml of the reaction solutions were collected at time points of 0 12 24 36 and 48 h dissolved organic matter dom in the solutions was immediately monitored using fluorescence spectroscopy the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectrum was collected on a f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer by scanning the excitation wavelengths from 200 to 600 nm and detecting the emission fluorescence between 200 and 600 nm at 5 nm intervals then parallel factor analysis parafac modeling was conducted to identify the changed fluorescent components during the reaction period using matlab 7 1 math works natick ma usa in addition the inorganic and organic carbon contents in the collected solutions were measured using a multi n c 3100 total organic carbon toc analyzer analytikjena germany to examine the photomineralization of tetracycline and its photoproducts 3 results and discussion 3 1 rapid degradation of tetracycline upon sunlight irradiation tetracycline photolysis during day night cycling was conducted in milliq ultrapure water xianlin pond water and jiuxiang river water a 500 w xenon lamp with a 260 nm glass filter restricting the transmission of wavelengths below 260 nm was used to mimic the solar irradiation at the earth s surface as shown in supplemental figure s1 the spectrum in this study spanned the uv b 280 320 nm uv a 320 400 nm visible 400 700 nm and near infrared 700 1000 nm wavelengths of sunlight tetracycline was quickly depleted in the three water samples upon simulated sunlight irradiation fig 1 after 12 h irradiation up to 89 7 0 2 95 9 0 1 and 92 0 0 1 of the tetracycline was degraded in the ultrapure pond and river water respectively the rapid photolysis of tetracycline was also supported by the uv vis absorption spectrum as shown in figure s2 the absorption spectrum of tetracycline contained two bands in the regions of 230 320 nm and 320 370 nm with peak wavelengths of ca 270 nm and 360 nm the absorption maximum at 270 nm was attributed to the absorption of the chromophore formed by the amide diketone and hydroxyl groups of the a ring of tetracycline whereas the absorption at 360 nm was due to the chromophore of the bcd rings of tetracycline which are made up of the phenyl hydroxytone group found in the carbonyl and ketone groups nelson et al 2001 both absorption regions fall within the spectrum of solar irradiation making tetracycline is photoactive the two natural surface waters had significantly higher tetracycline degradation rates than ultrapure water annova test p 0 05 probably because these contained diverse natural photosensitizing materials such as dom no3 and no2 as shown in table s1 which can directly or indirectly promote chemical degradation by producing light induced reactive oxygen species lópez peñalver et al 2010 werner et al 2006 contrary to the total ion and carbon contents in the two natural waters table s1 tetracycline had a higher photolysis rate in the pond water than in the river water this might be due to the quenching effect of excessively high concentrations of ions or organic matter which usually decreases the production of active radicals and depresses pollutant photolysis awfa et al 2020 chen et al 2011 comparing the uv vis spectrum of tetracycline with the major degradation products in figure s2 we found that irradiation destroyed the core structure of tetracycline especially the bcd rings of the molecule because most products except for one product in ultrapure water lost the specific absorption of these rings i e 360 nm region collectively these results confirmed that tetracycline in the sunlit aquatic environment is quite unstable and that natural aquatic constituents dramatically affect tetracycline photolysis 3 2 unrecognized dark transformations of tetracycline degradation products from the hplc chromatograms more product peaks were observed in ultrapure water than in the two natural waters fig 1 probably due to different degrees of tetracycline degradation in natural waters vs ultrapure water it is reasonable to assume that compared with ultrapure water the higher level of tetracycline degradation in natural waters was because only photodegradation pathways exist for the former whereas degradation in the latter involves both direct and indirect pathways accordingly this would cause greater residues of the intermediates in ultrapure water and thus more product peaks on the lc chromatogram according to the retention time and uv vis absorption spectrum these products were named products a to g over the first 12 h of irradiation tetracycline in the three water samples rapidly decayed to residual levels with most of the primary products continuously increasing in concentration fig 1 however product c in natural waters and products b and c in ultrapure water only increased in the first 4 h and then rapidly decreased with time until 12 h interestingly this kind of decrease continuously proceeded throughout the first period of dark incubation 12 24 h demonstrating that some photoproducts are unstable after formation and may undergo non photochemical processes e g hydrolysis in the dark meanwhile during the dark period of 12 24 h other products increased in concentration such as products a and d in ultrapure water and products a and g in natural waters demonstrating the existence of interconversions of metabolites under dark conditions to the best of our knowledge these dark transformations of tetracycline metabolites have rarely been reported in the second day night cycle most product peaks decreased to undetectable levels with increasing time note that product a in natural waters remained quite stable over the entire experimental period highlighting its potential photostability this was consistent with the absorption maxima of the product at 250 nm and 300 nm which are no longer completely within the irradiation spectrum of the xenon lamp compare figure s1 and figure s2 moreover unlike its photostability in natural waters this product in ultrapure water exhibited a continuous decrease during the second irradiation period of 24 36 h fig 1 implying that natural components in surface waters may also prevent further photolysis of this metabolite 3 3 identification of tetracycline degradation products transformation products at sampling times of 12 24 36 and 48 h were identified using hplc ms ms in general three steps were used to identify products with the acquired spectral data 1 identification of the molecular mass via the ms full scan 2 identification of potential transformation reactions via mass difference spectral and retention time comparisons and 3 identification of the reaction site via ionization behavior ms ms spectra retention time comparisons and external information using these strategies we were able to identify probable structures of products without standards in total 17 likely products were identified with relatively confidence levels of 2 and 3 the proposed formula structure retention time and confidence level of each product are summarized in table s2 and the detailed chromatograms and fragmentation patterns are presented in figure s3 more details on the product structure identification and confidence assignment are summarized in supplemental text s1 for simplicity we named the products based on abbreviated molecular ions as p474 p461 p445 p431 p417 p413 p396 p399 p398 p384 p360 p313 p301 p299 p212 1 p212 2 p203 and p187 among these 13 products were detected in ultrapure water whereas 15 products were detected in two natural waters fig 2 product p445 had the same molecular weight but different retention time 1 22 vs 2 20 min as tetracycline and was identified as isotetracycline an important tetracycline transformation product in basic solutions mohammed ali 2012 mojica et al 2014 zhong et al 2022 which was consistent with the ph of the solution 8 0 in this study some products were short written as m 29 for p474 m 16 for p461 m 14 for p431 m 28 for p417 m 32 for p413 m 47 for p398 and m 61 for p384 indicating a mass difference relative to tetracycline the product p474 may be generated via the hydroxylation of tetracycline and subsequently subjected to attack by reactive radicals huang et al 2021 yang et al 2018 product p461 was assigned as monohydroxylated tetracycline which was also observed in direct photolysis and advanced oxidation reactions of tetracycline in previous studies ji et al 2016b niu et al 2013b the products p431 and p417 were identified as 4 demethyltetracycline and 4 dedimethyltetracycline respectively these two products were generated by the sequential demethylation of the dimethylamino group of tetracycline further review of the literature also demonstrated that 4 demethyltetracycline exists extensively in various tetracycline degradation processes including photolysis jiao et al 2008 niu et al 2013b photocatalysis niu et al 2013a zhu et al 2013 and advanced oxidation processes chen et al 2017a ji et al 2016a the product p413 originated from the loss of the amino group and n methyl from the tetracycline molecule product p384 was attributed to the loss of the dimethylammonium and hydroxy groups from tetracycline and p398 was proposed as 4a 12a anhydro 4 oxo 4 dedimethylaminotetracycline a known photooxidation product of tetracycline in aqueous solutions davies et al 1979 in addition some low molecular weight products such as p360 p313 p301 p299 p212 p203 and p187 were also identified these compounds retain the partial skeletal structures of tetracycline and some of its intermediates such as isotetracycline fig 2 demonstrating their generation from further degradation of the metabolites finally photomineralization of tetracycline also occurred as indicated by the decreased organic carbon content in water during the irradiation periods figure s4 3 4 mechanism underlying dark transformation it is well known that h2o2 is an important photoproduct of the solar irradiation of natural waters cooper and zika 1983 cooper et al 1988 scully et al 1995 the associated mechanism involves the photooxidation of natural dom to generate o2 which is further converted to h2o2 during dismutation in ultrapure water the direct photolysis of tetracycline molecules to produce h2o2 has been widely reported chen et al 2008 chen et al 2012 lópez peñalver et al 2010 therefore it is believed that h2o2 was also formed in our system considering its relatively high oxidation capacity we initially hypothesized that the h2o2 formed during the photolysis process could lead to the observed transformations under subsequent dark conditions however the addition of catalase used to decompose h2o2 into the irradiated solution which was then incubated in the dark for different times did not affect the dark reactions of the major photoproducts figure s5 therefore the contribution of h2o2 to dark transformations was ruled out however we found that dark transformations increased with increasing ph fig 3 demonstrating that alkaline conditions favored dark transformations considering that the normal ph range in surface water systems is 6 5 8 5 the observed dark reactions of the tetracycline photoproducts are highly likely in natural surface waters in addition dark transformations also significantly increased with increasing incubation temperature fig 4 accordingly we expect the dark reactions of tetracycline photoproducts to be most prominent in warm sunlit waters whereas colder winterlike conditions should promote photoproduct stability the hplc ms ms analysis of the dynamics of tetracycline and its metabolites indicated that the observed dark reactions originated from several hydrolysis reactions first although we did not observe tetracycline dark degradation on the lc chromatograms the higher resolution hplc ms ms analysis demonstrated that tetracycline concentration actually decreased in the three waters during dark incubation periods figure s6 confirming the presence of tetracycline hydrolysis in the dark tetracycline is known to be unstable at high phs kühne et al 2000 mohammed ali 2012 so the relatively alkaline conditions in this study would benefit its hydrolysis similarly isotetracycline concentrations also decreased during the dark incubation period as shown in figure s6 and table s2 demonstrating that it also underwent dark hydrolysis recently zhong et al 2022 found that the major hydrolysis products of tetracycline in wastewater treatment plants included 4 epi tetracycline m z 445 1610 androtetracycline m z 427 1505 4 epi anhydrotetracycline m z 427 1505 p402 and several of our observed products including p417 p461 and p399 additionally we found that p461 p431 p398 p384 p313 and p301 also decreased during the two dark incubation periods table s2 in contrast p474 p417 p360 p212 1 and p212 2 increased in the dark previous studies have suggested that hydroxyl addition is a common phototransformation pathway and subsequent hydrolysis reactions often form secondary products ho 1986 zuo et al 2006 therefore p461 a monohydroxylated product may undergo a spontaneous dark hydrolysis reaction after its formation based on the opposite changing patterns of 4 demethyltetracycline p431 and 4 dedimethyltetracycline p417 in the dark we propose that 4 demethyltetracycline produced from the demethylation of the dimethylamino group of tetracycline during irradiation is structurally unstable and then undergoes another spontaneous demethylation reaction in the dark resulting in the generation of 4 dedimethyltetracycline products p398 p384 p313 and p301 might also have thermodynamically favored hydrolytic reactions in the dark with p212 1 p212 2 and p360 as the major hydrolysis products although we were unable to confirm this the hydrolysis reactions described above also explain the observed ph and temperature effects on dark transformation a lower ph would provide more protons to inhibit the base catalyzed hydrolysis reactions such as the hydrolysis of tetracycline isotetracycline and p431 the higher tem increased the reaction energy input to facilitate the hydrolysis reactions in this study the hplc pad analysis revealed 3 5 primary tetracycline products in the three water samples fig 1 and some products were confirmed by lc ms ms for example we propose products a c and f in fig 1 as p212 p431 and p417 respectively 3 5 ecotoxicity of irradiated tetracycline solutions the ecotoxicity of tetracycline and its products was predicted using qsar as shown in table 1 all compounds were classified into four categories according to the ghs united nations 2011 very toxic lc50 ec50 chv 1 mg l toxic 1 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 10 mg l harmful 10 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l and not harmful lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l all 17 products were predicted to cause some ecotoxicity and seven metabolites showed higher toxicity than tetracycline indicating that photolysis could enhance the toxicity of the irradiated solution for acute toxicity p299 was predicted to have the highest toxicity to fish and algae whereas p203 exhibited the highest toxicity to daphnids regarding chronic toxicity product p203 also showed the highest toxicity to daphnids and algae and p299 had the highest toxicity to fish although the qsar predicted toxicity requires further experimental validation it provides a preliminary assessment of the risk of tetracycline photoproducts furthermore a bacterial cultivation experiment was used to track the changing toxicity of the tetracycline solution during the simulated day night succession as shown in fig 5 during the first 12 h of irradiation the toxicity of the tetracycline solution in ultrapure water to e coli gradually decreased with time which was consistent with the corresponding tetracycline degradation in this water fig 1 however in the natural waters the toxicity only significantly decreased in first 4 h and then increased with increasing time to 12 h this corresponded with the fact that 90 of tetracycline in natural waters was degraded in the first 4 h fig 1 thus demonstrating that further photolysis increased the solution toxicity to e coli inconsistent observations between natural and artificial waters could be related to the discrepant intermediate products described above additionally aquatic components in natural waters might also cause combined toxicity with the degradation products afterwards dark incubation for 12 24 h generally decreased the toxicity of the three water samples confirming that the observed dark transformation reaction also affects the toxicity of the reacted solutions it is well known that the c4 dimethylaminon group is essential for tetracycline antibacterial activity schnappinger and hillen 1996 therefore it is assumed that the aforementioned dark demethylation of the c4 dimethylaminon group to produce 4 dedimethyltetracycline contributed to the observed toxicity reduction in the dark incubation period during the second irradiation period the solution toxicity decreased in the ultrapure water but did not change in the two natural waters during the last 12 h of incubation in the dark the reaction solutions from the three water samples showed similar toxicities together these results demonstrate that the observed dark reactions significantly affect the ecological risk of tetracycline and its photoproducts in addition the fluorescent changes of the three water bodies during the day night succession of tetracycline were monitored as detailed in supplemental text s2 and figures s7 s9 interestingly we also observed the rebound of fluorescence in natural waters in dark periods highlighting that the observed dark reaction could also affect the fluorescence of natural organic matter 4 conclusions this study is the first to investigate tetracycline photolysis in the natural diurnal cycle and found several overlooked hydrolysis reactions of tetracycline and its photoproducts in the dark the lc ms ms analysis identified a range of isomerized hydroxylated demethylated deaminated and open ring photoproducts exposure experiments indicated that photoproduct mixtures in natural waters retained their toxicity even after the near complete photolysis of tetracycline the observed dark reactions also affected the ecotoxicity and fluorescence properties of the irradiated solutions significant differences in the photoproducts and associated ecotoxicity between pure water and natural waters demonstrate the potential shortcomings of studying pollutant
