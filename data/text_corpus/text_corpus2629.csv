wastewater direct contact membrane distillation taguchi approach regression equation membrane characterization 1 introduction the textile industry accounts for one of the most extensive fresh water consuming industries globally thereby generating enormous amounts of wastewater 1 on average textile industries release 0 8 million tons year of wastewater containing harmful effluents which have an adverse effect on the environment 2 this textile wastewater contributes to almost 17 20 of industrial wastewater generated worldwide 3 to produce 1 ton of textile product nearly 300 tons of freshwater is consumed making this industry heavily accountable for severe environmental risks 4 the harmful effluents from this industry include dyes heavy metals salts and surfactants which cause a threat to human and aquatic life more importantly dyes present in wastewater absorb sunlight thereby reducing the amount available for aquatic life which is a serious issue to be addressed 5 hence the need for the treatment of wastewater came into existence since a wide range of effluents is present in textile wastewater applications of conventional separation processes like physical chemical and biological treatment are limited 2 pressure driven membrane based separation technologies like ultrafiltration uf 6 nanofiltration nf 7 and reverse osmosis ro 8 gathered attention these processes did not last long since these processes came with various limitations which made these processes economically not significant these limitations include a low rejection efficiency for uf high input pressure for nf and ro 9 membrane distillation md a thermal driven membrane based separation technology overcomes these limitations to achieve zero liquid discharge zld by operating at atmospheric conditions although the md concept came into existence in the 1960s there was no significant research done in this field at the initial development stage due to the unavailability of membranes in the past few decades md gained the popularity of the researchers in terms of the availability of a wide range of membrane materials which resulted in high rejection efficiency and lower fouling tendency compared to pressure driven membrane separation processes 10 the hydrophobic md membrane allows only vapor molecules from hot feed solution to pass through it thereby blocking the aqueous solutions 11 12 one of the main reasons for selecting md for textile wastewater treatment arises from the fact that dye wastewater coming from the dyeing process that comes at 70 90 c which is good to enter the md set up thereby making this process economically feasible by eliminating the requirement of heating the feed 13 14 the basic configurations of md include direct contact membrane distillation dcmd 15 air gap membrane distillation agmd 16 sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd 17 and vacuum membrane distillation vmd 18 in all these md configurations the hot feed solution is in direct contact with the active layer of the membrane surface another side of the membrane gets in direct contact with cold fluid as in dcmd through air gap as in agmd sweep gas as in sgmd and vacuum in vmd the present work solely focuses on dcmd for wastewater treatment the schematic of the dcmd module is shown in fig 1 the selection of membrane plays a vital role in the performance of md the available commercial membranes possess lower permeability and higher fouling than fabricated membranes these membranes cannot be modified to alter the properties of the membrane hence the necessity of membrane fabrication and modification came into existence 19 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is one of the widely used polymeric materials for membrane fabrication due to its high hydrophobicity nature outstanding mechanical chemical and thermal resistant properties 20 21 several approaches have been proposed in the literature to improve the properties and performances of pvdf membranes in md these include coatings with hydrophobic perfluoro polymers 22 the combination with other polymers 23 the use of superhydrophobic electrospun nanofibers 24 and the incorporation of nano particles 25 26 the present paper investigates the incorporation of tio2 nano particles and polyethylene glycol peg additive to the pvdf membrane for dye effluent treatment since pvdf is a highly hydrophobic pore forming agent namely peg is added to enhance the porosity of the fabricated membrane over the wide range of nanomaterials tio2 nano particles are selected particularly for this study the reason is tio2 nano particles not only increase porosity but also possess excellent antibacterial and photocatalytic properties 27 28 when the fouled membrane is exposed to uv light or sunlight tio2 nano particles degrade the dye thereby self cleaning the membrane hence membrane shelf life can be increased taguchi design has been selected for the designing of experiments taguchi design is one of the statistical optimization approaches which is extensively used to reduce total experiments to a minimum number by identifying optimum conditions 29 this helps in significantly reducing experimental duration and expenditure taguchi array consists of an outer and an inner array and the orthogonal array oa of taguchi design is made from the inner array with the help of oa experiments can be performed by using optimum conditions 30 the signal to noise ratio s n ratio is an important tool in taguchi design to determine experimental results by decreasing the noise factor effect the s n ratio can be maximized enhancing product quality based on the objective function the s n ratio can be 1 nominal is best 2 lower is better and 3 higher is better in this study optimum permeate flux is desired hence s n ratio is calculated for a higher is the better case by following the equation given below 13 1 s n 10 log 1 n j 1 y j 2 where yj refers to response at individual observation j and n are the total numbers of observations in this study oa l9 33 design is made with the help of minitab19 software for three factors a b and c and three levels 1 0 and 1 as shown in table 1 in the current study pvdf membrane incorporated with tio2 nano particles and peg additive is fabricated using phase inversion method and used in dcmd module the experiments are conducted as per taguchi orthogonal design for methyl red dye wastewater to determine optimum conditions performance of pvdf peg and pvdf peg tio2 are evaluated along with rejection at optimum conditions fabricated membranes are subjected to different characterization techniques like scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffraction xrd porosity and contact angle measurement test 2 experimental 2 1 materials methyl red c15h15n3o2 mw 269 31 and the pore forming

procured from rankem ltd thane india and titanium dioxide tio2 nano particles are procured from ad nano technologies shimoga india with 99 purity having an average particle size of 30 50 nm 2 2 fabrication and modification of pvdf membranes the wet phase inversion approach was employed to prepare the membranes used in this study pvdf peg200 and pvdf peg200 tio2 are labeled as m1 and m2 respectively throughout the study for the preparation of membrane m1 pvdf 15 wt is dissolved in dmf solvent in a beaker with the help of a magnetic stirrer maintained at 60 c at the rate of 120 rpm the solution is made air tight by covering the beaker surface with aluminum foil after 3 4 h of stirring peg 200 1 wt is added and again set for stirring till a pale yellowish homogenous solution is obtained this solution obtained is termed the dope solution the dope solution is cooled for 30 min and kept in a sonication bath elma model ti h 5 for 30 min to remove air bubbles present in the dope solution the glass plate on which the membrane is cast should be clean from dirt particles the presence of dirt particles on the glass plate leads to pinholes over the membrane surface which is undesirable for this purpose the glass plate is rinsed with distilled water and dried till all water molecules are evaporated a support is placed on the glass plate and dmf is sprayed gently on the support to ensure proper bonding between membrane support the membrane is released on the support placed on the glass plate the casting procedure is done with the help of a 150 mm doctor s blade using an automatic film applicator the applied cast is exposed to air for 15 20 s and dipped in a non solvent bath deionized water this operation is done for 24 h followed by 12 h of drying for the preparation of the m2 membrane tio2 exfoliation was done in dmf using a sonication bath for 30 min at a 50 khz frequency the obtained solution is mixed with the dope solution for 2 h and cast in a similar procedure as m1 preparation the steps for the fabrication of m1 and m2 are summarized in fig 2 2 3 methods 2 3 1 membrane porosity and membrane thickness the porosity of the membrane represents the pore volume of the membrane concerning the total volume of the membrane the porosity of the membrane is calculated by the gravimetric method membrane samples were cut down into 2 cm 2 cm sizes this sample weight is noted as wdry the sample is then immersed in methanol for 24 h and then removed the excess moisture and noted weight as wwet using an analytical balance mettler toledo model 31 the same procedure is performed three times and membrane porosity is determined by the equation below 2 Œµ w wet w dry a l œÅ m where a l and œÅm represent the membrane sample area m2 membrane thickness cm and density of methanol g cm3 with the help of the baker thickness gauge membrane thickness at different locations on the membrane surface is noted and the average value is determined 2 3 2 contact angle measurement the water contact angle is determined for the membrane with the help of a contact angle goniometer oca20 dataphysics incorporated with an image processing tool with a sessile drop technique on the membrane surface 0 5 Œºl of water droplets are dispended carefully with the help of a syringe at random locations and averaged for accurate readings 2 3 3 uv vis spectrophotometry since the feed solution is a synthetic dye solution uv vis spectrophotometry is used to calculate absorbance which is used to estimate unknown concentrations 23 the procured methyl red sample is processed in uv vis spectrophotometry to determine its peak wavelength the wavelength at which maximum absorbance is obtained is termed peak wavelength from this methyl red has a peak wavelength of 450 nms at this wavelength the calibration curve is plotted with known concentrations versus absorbance the purpose of this calibration curve is to find out the absorbance of unknown methyl red solution and thereby calculate concentration from the calibration curve deionized water is taken as a stock solution for this study rejection can be calculated by using the below formula 3 rejection 1 c retentate c feed where cretentate and cfeed refer to the concentration of retentate and feed respectively 2 3 4 x ray diffraction xrd for detection of crystallinity of tio2 powder pure and fouled m1 and m2 membranes an xrd analyzer is used specifications of equipment include rigakuminiflex model with a scanning speed of 0 01 100 deg min with scintillaternal ti detector 32 2 3 5 field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds surface morphology and eds mapping of both pure and fouled m1 and m2 membranes are examined using fei novasem equipment before performing the procedure the membranes were ruptured in liquid nitrogen and gold coated using an ion sputtering device named hitachi e 1010 under vacuum 31 2 4 experimental setup the experimental setup consists of a dcmd module equipped with a developed flat sheet hydrophobic membrane to evaluate permeate flux and rejection by altering operating parameters fig 4 the dcmd experimental setup is shown in fig 5 the feed solution is prepared by dissolving methyl red in deionized water and stirred with the help of a magnetic stirrer for 4 h maintained at room temperature fig 3 as this experimental study is performed at three different feed concentrations 75 ppm 100 ppm 125 ppm respective feed solutions are prepared based on the experimental runs the permeate solution is deionized water held at 15 2 c the temperature at the hot feed section and cold permeate section are maintained using a heater equipped with a thermocouple and chiller respectively the temperature sensors are installed at the feed side and permeate side respectively these sensors help in monitoring the temperature across the membrane module effectively as the dcmd process occurs at atmospheric conditions pressure is always maintained at 1 atm throughout the experiment the feed and permeate solution are fed to the dcmd module having an effective membrane area of 42 75 cm2 with the help of reverse osmosis ro booster pump these booster pumps have an inlet pressure of 30 psi higher than atmospheric conditions as the feed and permeate solutions enter the membrane module after passing through the heater chiller respectively pressure loss occurs due to the distance traveled a flow control valve is attached to the setup to maintain pressure at atmospheric conditions flow rates at the feed and permeate inlets are maintained using a flow meter after every 1 h excess volume collected in permeate tank is noted and an experiment is performed for 4 h experiments are repeated twice for reproducibility the permeate flux jw kg m2 h is calculated by the equation below 4 j w v œÅ a t where Œ¥v represents excess volume collected in permeate tank l œÅ is the density of water kg m3 a denotes effective membrane area m2 and Œ¥t represents the time of permeation h 3 results 3 1 taguchi l9 approach the present study calculates permeate flux for membrane m1 by performing nine experimental runs with two repetitions for each run as shown in table 2 in table 2 each row represents an experimental run 3 1 1 analysis of anova the anova is applied to calculate variance and determine the relative importance of factors at a 95 confidence level it also gives information about the effect of individual factors on the optimization condition the main effects plot for permeate flux and s n ratio are shown in fig 6 these plots help in understanding the trends of operating factors the permeate flux increases as the feed temperature rise because of the exponential relationship between vapor pressure and temperature as the flow rate rises turbulence increases which in turn increases permeability which leads to a decrease in thermal boundary thickness as a result permeate flux increases with it with the rise in feed concentration the membrane top layer gets clogged with dye present in the feed resulting in declining permeate flux anova results are depicted in table 3 the results from table 3 reveal that all factors are highly significant at a 95 confidence level the main effects plot s n ratio are shown in fig 7 the higher s n ratio specifies good product quality the s n ratio increases rapidly with an increase in feed temperature and increases only a little bit with the feed flow rate similarly with the rise in feed concentration the s n ratio decreases from the above observation we can conclude that feed temperature is the most significant factor and substantially impacts permeate flux 3 1 2 regression model the regression model is adopted in nominal p value at 95 confident level or to get the highest adjusted r square possible and lowest standard error estimate s in the present study all factors are significant so the regression model is adapted to get the lowest standard error estimate s the lower the value of s the better the model generated the regression model is developed by taking permeate flux as a dependent variable on factors namely feed temperature a feed concentration b and flow rate c based on this the best possible model for calculating permeate flux is given as 5 permeate flux 28 14 0 2523 a 0 0408 b 53 02 c 0 001506 ab 0 4457 ac 0 2131 bc the above is valid only in the scale of optimized variables the anova for the regression model is shown in table 4 by exploring the generated regression model the highest contributed main effect is the flow rate c still its effect is neutralized to the maximum extent by considering ac bc which are negative the other main effect which influences the permeate flux is feed temperature a lastly feed concentration b negatively affects permeate flux since its factor b is overruled by the bc term the regression model generated is used to calculate the permeate fluxes of all given input conditions these results are shown in table 5 the percentage difference between experimental and predicted results from the regression equation is between 0 26 and 5 04 the given findings reveal that the observed and projected computations are in good agreement from table 5 the optimum permeate flux is obtained at the seventh run where the predicted and experimental permeate fluxes are 5 22 and 5 10 0 10 kg m2h respectively a matlab algorithm was created to justify the best factor combination that maximizes permeate flux based on the provided regression model this program uses a random number generator to generate random factor combinations to calculate permeate flux this matlab code uses the regression equation as an objective function and calculates maximum flux minimum flux and optimum value for which objective function is maximum fig 8 shows the histogram representing the results of 50 00 000 sample calculations for random number combinations the minimum and maximum permeate fluxes are obtained at the extreme left and extreme right of the plot table 6 shows results of optimum operating conditions and optimum permeate flux obtained 3 2 membrane properties table 7 gives information about contact angle membrane thickness and porosity for m1 and m2 membranes from the table it is evident that the m2 membrane has a higher porosity than the m1 membrane and a slightly lower contact angle still the hydrophobicity of the m2 is not much altered when compared with m1 3 3 effect of additive on membrane performance at optimum conditions m2 is tested for determining the permeate flux the permeate obtained using m2 is 6 22 kg m2h which is 21 96 more than the calculated permeate flux for m1 this signifies that additive plays an essential role in enhancing permeate flux at optimum conditions color rejection is 100 for both m1 and m2 3 3 1 effect of feed temperature on permeate flux for m1 m2 fig 9 represents the effect of feed temperature on permeate flux for both membranes m1 m2 for this comparison other operating parameters are maintained at their optimum values obtained from taguchi doe feed concentration at 75 ppm flow rate at 0 8 lpm from the figure it is clear that permeate flux of the m2 membrane is higher than the m1 membrane increases with increasing temperature 33 the error bar for the obtained results shall be 0 12 3 3 2 effect of feed concentration on permeate flux for m1 m2 fig 10 depicts the effect of feed concentration on permeate flux at optimum conditions of feed temperature 65 c and flow rate at 0 8 lpm the higher value of permeate flux for m2 membrane than m1 shows the anti fouling characteristics of the tio2 nano particles also the permeate flux decreases with the concentration due to the deposition of dye molecules on the membrane surface the error bar for the obtained results shall be 0 12 3 3 3 effect of flow rate on permeate flux for m1 m2 the increasing pattern in the permeate flux was observed with the feed flow rate values as shown in fig 11 while keeping feed concentration at 75 ppm feed temperature at 65 c again it was observed that the permeate flux obtained using the m2 membrane is higher than the m1 membrane increases with increasing flow rate 34 the error bar for the obtained results shall be 0 12 3 4 x ray diffraction this characterization method is performed to identify the crystallinity of the membrane figs 12 and 13 represent xrd of pure and fouled m1 and m2 membranes respectively m1 and m2 represent pure membranes while m1 f and m2 f represent fouled membranes of m1 and m2 respectively from fig 12 at the 2 theta value of 25 34 pvdf narrow peak is obtained as shown in both m1 and m1 f m1 membrane has more crystallinity than the m1 f membrane this is because the intensity of m1 intensity 304 counts is more than m1 f intensity 294 counts from fig 13 the tio2 peak is obtained at the 2 theta value of 26 02 thus two narrow peaks are obtained at 25 34 and 26 02 which verifies the presence of pvdf and tio2 in both pure and fouled m2 membranes the fouled m2 intensity 228 counts is less crystallinity than m2 intensity 292 counts 3 5 fesem eds to find out the surface morphology of all the fabricated and fouled membranes sem analysis is carried out fig 10 shows the surface morphology of pure and modified membranes along with fouled membranes for pure pvdf peg membrane m1 the addition of peg additive into dope solution enhanced the viscosity of the solution thereby delaying the solvent non solvent exchange fig 14 a due to this more pores are formed on the membrane surface and pertain to the spongy structure in fouled pvdf peg membrane m1 f it can be seen that number of pores available on the membrane surface significantly decreased due to the accumulation of foulants fig 14 b for pure pvdf peg tio2 modified membrane m2 tio2 nano particles get incorporated on the membrane surface and are visibly shown on the membrane surface in white color fig 14 c with the incorporation of tio2 nanomaterials fig 14 e the dope solution requires more time to attain homogeneity since the time for mixing of solid liquid liquid increases therefore it resulted in morphology consisting of more pores fig 14 d represents the fouled pvdf peg tio2 modified membrane m2 f foulants accumulated on the membrane surface are relatively less the eds validates the presence of elemental composition of the pure and fouled membrane the essence of this analysis is to verify whether fouled membrane has the presence of tio2 nanomaterials or not fig 15 represents the eds mapping of pure and fouled pvdf peg tio2 membrane eds confirms the presence of tio2 nano particles in the fouled membrane which makes the fabricated m2 membrane highly stable 3 6 effect of long run operation on membrane performance a run has been performed to determine the effect on membrane performance for 72 h operation by taking m2 membrane at optimum conditions namely feed temperature of 65 c feed concentration of 75 ppm and flow rate of 0 8 lpm it can be found that the flux decreases slightly with the passasge of time and after long hour operation membrane started moving towards wetting phenomena that reduced the flux this justifies that the prepared m2 membrane serves the purpose of long run operations in membrane distillation fig 16 3 7 membrane self cleaning mechanism the tio2 nano particles possess photocatalytic activity and when exposed to sunlight uv radiation tio2 nano particles present on the membrane surface interact with uv light and decompose dye molecules attached as foulants resulting in the reduction in the membrane surface fouling 35 36 by this the m2 membrane can be reused by exposing the membrane to sunlight for 12 h and then rinsing with deionized water fig 17 represents a pure m2 membrane b fouled m2 membrane c regenerated m2 membrane these membrane schematics experimentally validate the self cleaning property of the m2 membrane 4 conclusions the performance of the dcmd process is investigated experimentally and optimized for dye wastewater treatment all membranes used in this study are fabricated using the phase inversion method the effects of feed temperature flow rate and feed concentration were evaluated in general permeate flux increases with an increase in feed temperature and flow rate permeate flux decreases with the increase in feed concentration the optimum conditions required for permeate flux are high temperature 65 c high flow rate 0 8lpm and low feed concentration 75 ppm the permeate flux calculated by the developed mathematical model by varying operating parameters was well fitted with experimental results having an r2value in the range of 0 9977 0 9990 100 color rejection of dye is obtained at optimum conditions for both membranes the effect of operating parameters on the permeate flux has been studied and obtained results are in good agreement with the results available in the literature the crystallinity surface morphology and hydrophobicity of the prepared membranes are evaluated by xrd fesem eds and water contact angle tests respectively the effect of tio2 on membrane performance is examined and it showed that modified membrane flux 6 22 0 12 kg m2h exhibited 21 96 more permeate flux than unmodified membrane flux 5 10 0 10 kg m2h the self cleaning mechanism of the m2 membrane is experimentally validated and future work involves increasing tio2 percentage into the dope solution and thereby finding out how membrane properties and permeate flux are altered declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

membrane thickness cm and density of methanol g cm3 with the help of the baker thickness gauge membrane thickness at different locations on the membrane surface is noted and the average value is

tool with a sessile drop technique on the membrane surface 0 5 Œºl of water droplets are dispended carefully with the help of a syringe at random locations and averaged for accurate readings 2 3 3 uv vis spectrophotometry since the feed solution is a synthetic dye solution uv vis spectrophotometry is used to calculate absorbance which is used to estimate unknown concentrations 23 the procured methyl red sample is processed in uv vis spectrophotometry to determine its peak wavelength the wavelength at which maximum absorbance is obtained is termed peak wavelength from this methyl red has a peak wavelength of 450 nms at this wavelength the calibration curve is plotted with known concentrations versus absorbance the purpose of this calibration curve is to find out the absorbance of unknown methyl red solution and thereby calculate concentration from the calibration curve deionized water is taken as a stock solution for this study rejection can be calculated by using the below formula 3 rejection 1 c retentate c feed where cretentate and cfeed refer to the concentration of retentate and feed respectively 2 3 4 x ray diffraction xrd for detection of crystallinity of tio2 powder pure and fouled m1 and m2 membranes an xrd analyzer is used specifications of equipment include rigakuminiflex model with a scanning speed of 0 01 100 deg min with scintillaternal ti detector 32 2 3 5 field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds surface morphology and eds mapping of both pure and fouled m1 and m2 membranes are examined using fei novasem equipment before performing the procedure the membranes were ruptured in liquid nitrogen and gold coated using an ion sputtering device named hitachi e 1010 under vacuum 31 2 4 experimental setup the experimental setup consists of a dcmd module equipped with a developed flat sheet hydrophobic membrane to evaluate permeate flux and rejection by altering operating parameters fig 4 the dcmd experimental setup is shown in fig 5 the feed solution is prepared by dissolving methyl red in deionized water and stirred with the help of a magnetic stirrer for 4 h maintained at room temperature fig 3 as this experimental study is performed at three different feed concentrations 75 ppm 100 ppm 125 ppm respective feed solutions are prepared based on the experimental runs the permeate solution is deionized water held at 15 2 c the temperature at the hot feed section and cold permeate section are maintained using a heater equipped with a thermocouple and chiller respectively the temperature sensors are installed at the feed side and permeate side respectively these sensors help in monitoring the temperature across the membrane module effectively as the dcmd process occurs at atmospheric conditions pressure is always maintained at 1 atm throughout the experiment the feed and permeate solution are fed to the dcmd module having an effective membrane area of 42 75 cm2 with the help of reverse osmosis ro booster pump these booster pumps have an inlet pressure of 30 psi higher than atmospheric conditions as the feed and permeate solutions enter the membrane module after passing through the heater chiller respectively pressure loss occurs due to the distance traveled a flow control valve is attached to the setup to maintain pressure at atmospheric conditions flow rates at the feed and permeate inlets are maintained using a flow meter after every 1 h excess volume collected in permeate tank is noted and an experiment is performed for 4 h experiments are repeated twice for reproducibility the permeate flux jw kg m2 h is calculated by the equation below 4 j w v œÅ a t where Œ¥v represents excess volume collected in permeate tank l œÅ is the density of water kg m3 a denotes effective membrane area m2 and Œ¥t represents the time of permeation h 3 results 3 1 taguchi l9 approach the present study calculates permeate flux for membrane m1 by performing nine experimental runs with two repetitions for each run as shown in table 2 in table 2 each row represents an experimental run 3 1 1 analysis of anova the anova is applied to calculate variance and determine the relative importance of factors at a 95 confidence level it also gives information about the effect of individual factors on the optimization condition the main effects plot for permeate flux and s n ratio are shown in fig 6 these plots help in understanding the trends of operating factors the permeate flux increases as the feed temperature rise because of the exponential relationship between vapor pressure and temperature as the flow rate rises turbulence increases which in turn increases permeability which leads to a decrease in thermal boundary thickness as a result permeate flux increases with it with the rise in feed concentration the membrane top layer gets clogged with dye present in the feed resulting in declining permeate flux anova results are depicted in table 3 the results from table 3 reveal that all factors are highly significant at a 95 confidence level the main effects plot s n ratio are shown in fig 7 the higher s n ratio specifies good product quality the s n ratio increases rapidly with an increase in feed temperature and increases only a little bit with the feed flow rate similarly with the rise in feed concentration the s n ratio decreases from the above observation we can conclude that feed temperature is the most significant factor and substantially impacts permeate flux 3 1 2 regression model the regression model is adopted in nominal p value at 95 confident level or to get the highest adjusted r square possible and lowest standard error estimate s in the present study all factors are significant so the regression model is adapted to get the lowest standard error estimate s the lower the value of s the better the model generated the regression model is developed by taking permeate flux as a dependent variable on factors namely feed temperature a feed concentration b and flow rate c based on this the best possible model for calculating permeate flux is given as 5 permeate flux 28 14 0 2523 a 0 0408 b 53 02 c 0 001506 ab 0 4457 ac 0 2131 bc the above is valid only in the scale of optimized variables the anova for the regression model is shown in table 4 by exploring the generated regression model the highest contributed main effect is the flow rate c still its effect is neutralized to the maximum extent by considering ac bc which are negative the other main effect which influences the permeate flux is feed temperature a lastly feed concentration b negatively affects permeate flux since its factor b is overruled by the bc term the regression model generated is used to calculate the permeate fluxes of all given input conditions these results are shown in table 5 the percentage difference between experimental and predicted results from the regression equation is between 0 26 and 5 04 the given findings reveal that the observed and projected computations are in good agreement from table 5 the optimum permeate flux is obtained at the seventh run where the predicted and experimental permeate fluxes are 5 22 and 5 10 0 10 kg m2h respectively a matlab algorithm was created to justify the best factor combination that maximizes permeate flux based on the provided regression model this program uses a random number generator to generate random factor combinations to calculate permeate flux this matlab code uses the regression equation as an objective function and calculates maximum flux minimum flux and optimum value for which objective function is maximum fig 8 shows the histogram representing the results of 50 00 000 sample calculations for random number combinations the minimum and maximum permeate fluxes are obtained at the extreme left and extreme right of the plot table 6 shows results of optimum operating conditions and optimum permeate flux obtained 3 2 membrane properties table 7 gives information about contact angle membrane thickness and porosity for m1 and m2 membranes from the table it is evident that the m2 membrane has a higher porosity than the m1 membrane and a slightly lower contact angle still the hydrophobicity of the m2 is not much altered when compared with m1 3 3 effect of additive on membrane performance at optimum conditions m2 is tested for determining the permeate flux the permeate obtained using m2 is 6 22 kg m2h which is 21 96 more than the calculated permeate flux for m1 this signifies that additive plays an essential role in enhancing permeate flux at optimum conditions color rejection is 100 for both m1 and m2 3 3 1 effect of feed temperature on permeate flux for m1 m2 fig 9 represents the effect of feed temperature on permeate flux for both membranes m1 m2 for this comparison other operating parameters are maintained at their optimum values obtained from taguchi doe feed concentration at 75 ppm flow rate at 0 8 lpm from the figure it is clear that permeate flux of the m2 membrane is higher than the m1 membrane increases with increasing temperature 33 the error bar for the obtained results shall be 0 12 3 3 2 effect of feed concentration on permeate flux for m1 m2 fig 10 depicts the effect of feed concentration on permeate flux at optimum conditions of feed temperature 65 c and flow rate at 0 8 lpm the higher value of permeate flux for m2 membrane than m1 shows the anti fouling characteristics of the tio2 nano particles also the permeate flux decreases with the concentration due to the deposition of dye molecules on the membrane surface the error bar for the obtained results shall be 0 12 3 3 3 effect of flow rate on permeate flux for m1 m2 the increasing pattern in the permeate flux was observed with the feed flow rate values as shown in fig 11 while keeping feed concentration at 75 ppm feed temperature at 65 c again it was observed that the permeate flux obtained using the m2 membrane is higher than the m1 membrane increases with increasing flow rate 34 the error bar for the obtained results shall be 0 12 3 4 x ray diffraction this characterization method is performed to identify the crystallinity of the membrane figs 12 and 13 represent xrd of pure and fouled m1 and m2 membranes respectively m1 and m2 represent pure membranes while m1 f and m2 f represent fouled membranes of m1 and m2 respectively from fig 12 at the 2 theta value of 25 34 pvdf narrow peak is obtained as shown in both m1 and m1 f m1 membrane has more crystallinity than the m1 f membrane this is because the intensity of m1 intensity 304 counts is more than m1 f intensity 294 counts from fig 13 the tio2 peak is obtained at the 2 theta value of 26 02 thus two narrow peaks are obtained at 25 34 and 26 02 which verifies the presence of pvdf and tio2 in both pure and fouled m2 membranes the fouled m2 intensity 228 counts is less crystallinity than m2 intensity 292 counts 3 5 fesem eds to find out the surface morphology of all the fabricated and fouled membranes sem analysis is carried out fig 10 shows the surface morphology of pure and modified membranes along with fouled membranes for pure pvdf peg membrane m1 the addition of peg additive into dope solution enhanced the viscosity of the solution thereby delaying the solvent non solvent exchange fig 14 a due to this more pores are formed on the membrane surface and pertain to the spongy structure in fouled pvdf peg membrane m1 f it can be seen that number of pores available on the membrane surface significantly decreased due to the accumulation of foulants fig 14 b for pure pvdf peg tio2 modified membrane m2 tio2 nano particles get incorporated on the membrane surface and are visibly shown on the membrane surface in white color fig 14 c with the incorporation of tio2 nanomaterials fig 14 e the dope solution requires more time to attain homogeneity since the time for mixing of solid liquid liquid increases therefore it resulted in morphology consisting of more pores fig 14 d represents the fouled pvdf peg tio2 modified membrane m2 f foulants accumulated on the membrane surface are relatively less the eds validates the presence of elemental composition of the pure and fouled membrane the essence of this analysis is to verify whether fouled membrane has the presence of tio2 nanomaterials or not fig 15 represents the eds mapping of pure and fouled pvdf peg tio2 membrane eds confirms the presence of tio2 nano particles in the fouled membrane which makes the fabricated m2 membrane highly stable 3 6 effect of long run operation on membrane performance a run has been performed to determine the effect on membrane performance for 72 h operation by taking m2 membrane at optimum conditions namely feed temperature of 65 c feed concentration of 75 ppm and flow rate of 0 8 lpm it can be found that the flux decreases slightly with the passasge of time and after long hour operation membrane started moving towards wetting phenomena that reduced the flux this justifies that the prepared m2 membrane serves the purpose of long run operations in membrane distillation fig 16 3 7 membrane self cleaning mechanism the tio2 nano particles possess photocatalytic activity and when exposed to sunlight uv radiation tio2 nano particles present on the membrane surface interact with uv light and decompose dye molecules attached as foulants resulting in the reduction in the membrane surface fouling 35 36 by this the m2 membrane can be reused by exposing the membrane to sunlight for 12 h and then rinsing with deionized water fig 17 represents a pure m2 membrane b fouled m2 membrane c regenerated m2 membrane these membrane schematics experimentally validate the self cleaning property of the m2 membrane 4 conclusions the performance of the dcmd process is investigated experimentally and optimized for dye wastewater treatment all membranes used in this study are fabricated using the phase inversion method the effects of feed temperature flow rate and feed concentration were evaluated in general permeate flux increases with an increase in feed temperature and flow rate permeate flux decreases with the increase in feed concentration the optimum conditions required for permeate flux are high temperature 65 c high flow rate 0 8lpm and low feed concentration 75 ppm the permeate flux calculated by the developed mathematical model by varying operating parameters was well fitted with experimental results having an r2value in the range of 0 9977 0 9990 100 color rejection of dye is obtained at optimum conditions for both membranes the effect of operating parameters on the permeate flux has been studied and obtained results are in good agreement with the results available in the literature the crystallinity surface morphology and hydrophobicity of the prepared membranes are evaluated by xrd fesem eds and water contact angle tests respectively the effect of tio2 on membrane performance is examined and it showed that modified membrane flux 6 22 0 12 kg m2h exhibited 21 96 more permeate flux than unmodified membrane flux 5 10 0 10 kg m2h the self cleaning mechanism of the m2 membrane is experimentally validated and future work involves increasing tio2 percentage into the dope solution and thereby finding out how membrane properties and permeate flux are altered declaration of

graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords progressive freeze concentration pfc ca2 wastewater removal rate first principles redundancy analysis 1 introduction scaling is an urgent problem to be solved in the treatment of calcium containing wastewater at present especially in the treatment of metallurgical wastewater and paper making wastewater the lime precipitation method is commonly used which leads to the high ca2 concentration detected in reclaimed water and the formation of precipitation in the pipeline 1 2 once the scaling is formed it not only reduces the diameter of the pipe but also easily causes pipe blockage scaling can also corrode pipes and shorten their service life this will not only affect the production efficiency but also increase the cost of pipeline cleaning in serious cases it will also bring safety risks therefore it is urgent to solve the problem of excessive ca2 concentration ca2 concentration 200 mg l in the pipeline from the source at present the commonly used ca2 removal methods mainly include nanofiltration performances reverse osmosis chemical precipitation and ion exchange 3 8 nanofiltration membrane and reverse osmosis are mainly used in the treatment of low concentration ca2 wastewater but the membrane is expensive easy to block and low water treatment recovery rate nanofiltration is not only high operation cost but also easy to cause waste of water resources 9 the common methods for treating high concentration ca2 wastewater include chemical precipitation method and ion exchange method chemical precipitation method is to remove ca2 by adding chemicals into wastewater to generate caco3 precipitation which not only increases the cost of water production but also generates a large amount of solid waste and secondary pollution 10 11 ion exchange method has large capacity and no secondary pollution but the regeneration cost of exchange resin is high the parameter coordination is complex and it is greatly affected by water quality 12 13 moreover the current common methods for treating acidic calcium containing wastewater or alkaline calcium containing wastewater needs to be neutralized 14 which increases a part

detection methods referring to the water and wastewater monitoring analysis method fourth edition 2002 27 the ca2 concentration in the ice melt water and the water under ice were analyzed by

achieve a magnification of up to 1000 times 2 5 data analysis methods the residual rate i is defined as the ratio of the concentration of ca2 in the ice melt water to the concentration of ca2 in the

include ice thickness freezing temperature initial concentration and initial ph 3 results 3 1 removal efficiencies of ca2 under different experimental conditions 3 1 1 removal efficiencies of ca2 under different ice thickness melt water and water under ice obtained under different ice thickness were collected to detect the concentration of ca2 respectively and the removal efficiencies of ca2 under different ice thicknesses are shown by drawing fig 2 as shown in fig 2a when the ice thicknesses were 4 cm 8 cm 12 cm 16 cm and 20 cm the concentration of ca2 in melt water was significantly lower than that in the raw water by 500 mg l and with the increase of ice thickness the concentration of ca2 in melt water tended to decrease in addition to the ice thickness of 20 cm the ca2 concentration in molten water tends to decrease with the increase of ice thickness this is because at the initial stage of ice formation the ice rate is fast the number and volume of ice cells per unit volume of ice are large resulting in more captured ca2 solution resulting in higher ca2 concentration in ice with the progress of icing process the thickness of ice increases the heat exchange rate between the water under ice and environment weakens the growth rate of ice decreases the number of ice cells decreases and the volume becomes smaller resulting in the reduction of captured ca2 solution in newly formed ice body so the ca2 concentration of ice body is relatively low when the ice thickness reaches 20 cm the concentration of ca2 in subglacial water increases significantly and the concentration of ca2 solution captured by ice cells per unit volume of ice is very high resulting in the increase of ca2 concentration in ice the concentration of ca2 in melt water tended to decrease the concentration of ca2 in water under ice was obviously higher than that in the raw water by 500 mg l and with the increase of ice thickness the concentration of ca2 in the water under ice tended to increases as shown in fig 2b when the ice thicknesses were 4 cm 8 cm 12 cm 16 cm and 20 cm the residual rates i of ca2 in ice melting water were 7 51 6 10 4 58 3 65 and 4 70 the removal rates r of ca2 were 92 49 93 90 95 42 96 35 and 95 30 and the removal rates r were more than 90 when the ice thicknesses were 4 cm 8 cm 12 cm and 16 cm the ca2 removal rate r was positively correlated

temperature the concentration of ca2 in the water under ice tended to decreases as shown in fig 3b when the freezing temperatures were 5 c 10 c 15 c 20 c and 25 c the residual rates i of ca2 in ice melting water were 1 82 3 02 4 58 6 30 and 9 65 the removal rates r of ca2 were 98 18 96 98 95 42 93 70 and 90 35 and the removal rates r were more than 90 the ca2 removal rate r was positively correlated with the freezing temperature when the freezing temperatures were 5 c 10 c 15 c 20 c and 25 c the ca2 concentration rates p were 176 76 174 68 173 03 169 47 165 61 the concentration rate p of ca2 was positively correlated with freezing temperature 3 1 3 removal efficiencies of ca2 under different initial concentration melt water and water under ice obtained under different initial concentration were collected to detect the concentration of ca2 respectively and the removal efficiencies of ca2 under initial concentration were shown by drawing fig 4 as shown in fig 4a when the initial concentration were 300 mg l 400 mg l 500 mg l 600 mg l and 700 mg l the concentration of ca2 in melt water was significantly lower than that in the raw water and with the increase of initial concentration the concentration of ca2 in melt water tended to increase the concentration of ca2 in water under ice was obviously higher than that in the raw water and with the increase of initial concentration the concentration of ca2 in the water under ice tended to increases as shown in fig 4b when the initial concentrations were 300 mg l 400 mg l 500 mg l 600 mg l and 700 mg l the residual rates i of ca2 in ice melting water were 5 35 4 80 4 58 5 07 and 5 17 the removal rates r of ca2 were 94 65 95 20 95 42 94 93 and 94 83 and the removal rates r were more than 90 the ca2 removal rate r was firstly positively correlated with the initial concentration and then negatively correlated with the initial concentration when the initial concentration were 300 mg l 400 mg l 500 mg l 600 mg l and 700 mg l the ca2 concentration rates p were 155 19 159 38 167 03 196 70 and 206 03 the concentration rate p of ca2 was positively correlated with initial concentration 3 1 4 removal efficiencies of ca2 under different initial ph melt water and water under ice obtained under different initial ph were collected to detect the concentration of ca2 respectively and the removal efficiencies of ca2 under initial concentration were shown by drawing fig 5 as shown in fig 5a when the initial ph values were 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 5 the concentration of ca2 in melt water was significantly lower than that in the raw water by 500 mg l and with the increase of initial ph the concentration of ca2 in melt water tended to decrease the concentration of ca2 in water under ice was obviously higher than that in the raw water by 500 mg l and with the increase of initial ph the concentration of ca2 in the water under ice tended to increases as shown in fig 5b when the initial ph values were 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 5 the residual rates i of ca2 in ice melting water were 5 36 4 58 4 04 3 94 and 3 69 the removal rates r of ca2 were 94 64 95 42 95 96 96 06 and 96 31 and the removal rates r were more than 90 the ca2 removal rate r was positively correlated with the initial ph when the initial ph values were 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 5 the ca2 concentration rates p were 168 75 173 03 174 31 177 08 and 179 03 the concentration rate p of ca2 was positively correlated with initial ph 3 2 relationship between the ca2 removal characteristic parameters and different experimental conditions in the freezing process redundancy analysis showed that the experimental conditions such as ice thickness freezing temperature initial concentration and initial ph could explain 90 7 of the characteristic parameters of ca2 removal the order of importance of effective explanation was as follows ice thickness initial concentration freezing temperature ph table 1 according to the redundancy analysis the correlation order between the experimental conditions such as ice thickness freezing temperature initial concentration and initial ph and the characteristic parameters of ca2 removal were obtained fig 6 the ca2 concentration in melt water was positively correlated with the initial ca2 concentration and negatively correlated with other experimental conditions the order of correlation was as follows freezing temperature initial concentration ice thickness ph the ca2 concentration in water under ice was positively correlated with the experimental conditions and the order of correlation was as follows ice thickness initial concentration freezing temperature ph the removal rates r of ca2 were positively correlated with ice thickness freezing temperature and initial ph and negatively correlated with initial concentration the order of correlation was as follows freezing temperature ice thickness ph initial concentration the concentration rates p of ca2 were positively correlated with the experimental conditions and the order of correlation was as follows ice thickness initial concentration freezing temperature ph 3 3 mechanisms of ca2 removal during the freezing process in pfc the detection range of ca2 in melt water was 9 121 mg l 48 239 mg l and the removal rate r of ca2 ranged was 90 35 98 18 however the range of ca2 detected in the water under ice was 465 581 mg l 1685 452 mg l and the concentration rate p of ca2 was 116 61 370 09 the mechanism can be explained from the perspective of energy from the microscopic point of view in the unfrozen state water molecules are relatively free 29 and ca2 in water are tightly surrounded by water molecules when the temperature decreases energy decreases and water molecules and ca2 begin to move at a certain time the position structure of water molecules and ca2 appears to be optimal fig 7 and the energy is optimal for the coexistence of water molecules and ca2 as the energy continues to decrease water molecules begin to transform into tiny ice crystals at this time water molecules not only interact with ca2 but also form ice crystal structures which result in insufficient free water molecules surrounding ca2 from the microscopic model ca2 are more stable in the water phase than in the ice phase due to the tendency of ions to move towards the stable phase ca2 will migrate from the unstable ice phase to the stable water phase in the ice and water two phase system ca2 in ice phase can be removed from a macroscopic point of view when water begins to freeze the free water molecules are transformed into regular ice structures and the ice and water two phase system appears in the solution when ca2 is combined with ice phase the energy that must be overcome is small 30 so the energy released by ca2 in combination with the ice is small and the energy of the whole system is high so the system formed in the ice phase is unstable when ca2 is combined with water phase the energy that must be overcome is large so the energy released by ca2 in combination with the water is large and the energy of the whole system is low so the system formed in the water phase is relatively stable therefore ca2 migrate from the ice to the water under ice the removal rate of ca2 in pfc is mainly related to hydrogen bonding which can be divided into hydrogen bonds formed between water clusters and hydrogen bonds formed within water clusters according to different hydrogen bond positions fig 7 there is a competitive relationship between them and the role of hydrogen bonds within clusters is far greater than that of hydrogen bonds between clusters 31 32 for the hydrogen bonds formed with water clusters pure ice has a tetrahedral crystal structure and is formed by water molecules associating through hydrogen bonds 33 the association among molecules will result in the release of a large amount of energy and the rate of energy release determines the growth rate of ice crystals when the energy is low the thermal motion of water molecules is relatively weak and the formation rate of hydrogen bonds is accelerated thus the formation rate of ice crystals is accelerated since the temperature is greater than the solution of the substance diffusion the solid liquid interface is dendritic growth and ca2 have no time to escape and become trapped in the dendritic space to form ice cells 34 fig 8 higher growth rate will lead to more complex branching in ice crystals resulting in narrower channels higher flow resistance and less ca2 discharge 35 the freezing temperature and ice thickness affect the energy release rate because the increase in ice sheet thickness hinders the heat exchange between the water body under ice and the outside world when the temperature is higher and the ice thickness is larger the growth rate of ice crystals is lower in the case of slow growth the size of each ice crystal does not change much and ca2 and water molecules form a relatively balanced relationship between the ice and water two phase system the volume of newly formed ice crystals increases but the ability to capture ca2 decreases 32 therefore with the increase of ice thickness and freezing temperature the removal rate of ca2 increases in addition hydrogen bonds between water clusters also affect the removal ability of ca2 in the ice and water two phase system for the hydrogen bonds formed between water clusters when the solution concentration increases the effect of hydrogen bonds between clusters increases the diffusion coefficient decreases more granular ice crystals are formed and the surface area of ice crystals increases 36 although more ca2 have no time to escape and be captured in the ice body at the early stage of icing with the increase in ice thickness the crystal grows at a uniform speed and ca2 continue to migrate and the increase of ca2 in the ice is much smaller than that in the water under ice similarly an increase in ph can lead to a fundamental change in the structure of water clusters in ca2 solutions with increased ph the distance between cao atoms decreases which makes the hydration number of ca2 in the electrolyte solution decrease 37 38 the rate of ca2 escaping to the water is accelerated which makes it difficult to capture with ice bodies and there are fewer ca2 left in the ice body after freezing therefore with the increase of initial concentration and initial ph the removal rate of ca2 increases 4 conclusion the following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results obtained from the study during the freezing process of pfc ca2 migrates from the ice to the water under ice and the ca2 in the ice could be removed and the ice could be purified pfc has a good effect on the treatment of wastewater containing ca2 with different concentrations and ph by controlling the conditions when the freezing temperature was 5 c the ice thickness was 12 cm and the initial concentration was 500 mg l and the ph was 7 the removal rate was 98 the removal rates r were positively correlated with the ice thickness freezing temperature and initial ph in other words the higher the ice thickness freezing temperature and initial ph were the better the removal rates of ca2 were in the process of removing ca2 by pfc the ice thickness and initial concentration could explain 90 4 which has a good correlation with the experimental results freezing temperature and initial ph could only explain 0 3 which was weakly correlated with the experimental results the ability of ca2 removal was related to the hydrogen bond and the change of energy would affect the change of hydrogen bond in varying degrees the change of hydrogen bond was different under different conditions the freezing temperature and ice thickness mainly affected the hydrogen bond within clusters the initial concentration and ph mainly affected the hydrogen bond between clusters the effect of hydrogen bond within clusters was much greater than that of hydrogen bond between clusters credit

detection methods referring to the water and wastewater monitoring analysis method fourth edition 2002 27 the ca2 concentration in the ice melt water and the water under ice were analyzed by

under different ice thickness melt water and water under ice obtained under different ice thickness were collected to detect the concentration of ca2 respectively and the removal efficiencies of ca2 under different ice thicknesses are shown by drawing fig 2 as shown in fig 2a when the ice thicknesses were 4 cm 8 cm 12 cm 16 cm and 20 cm the concentration of ca2 in melt water was significantly lower than that in the raw water by 500 mg l and with the increase of ice thickness the concentration of ca2 in melt water tended to decrease in addition to the ice thickness of 20 cm the ca2 concentration in molten water tends to decrease with the increase of ice thickness this is because at the initial stage of ice formation the ice rate is fast the number and volume of ice cells per unit volume of ice are large resulting in more captured ca2 solution resulting in higher ca2 concentration in ice with the progress of icing process the thickness of ice increases the heat exchange rate between the water under ice and environment weakens the growth rate of ice decreases the number of ice cells decreases and the volume becomes smaller resulting in the reduction of captured ca2 solution in newly formed ice body so the ca2 concentration of ice body is relatively low when the ice thickness reaches 20 cm the concentration of ca2 in subglacial water increases significantly and the concentration of ca2 solution captured by ice cells per unit volume of ice is very high resulting in the increase of ca2 concentration in ice the concentration of ca2 in melt water tended to decrease the concentration of ca2 in water under ice was obviously higher than that in the raw water by 500 mg l and with the increase of ice thickness the concentration of ca2 in the water under ice tended to increases as shown in fig 2b when the ice thicknesses were 4 cm 8 cm 12 cm 16 cm and 20 cm the residual rates i of ca2 in ice melting water were 7 51 6 10 4 58 3 65 and 4 70 the removal

positively correlated with ice thickness 3 1 2 removal efficiencies of ca2 under different freezing temperature melt water and water under ice obtained under different freezing temperature were collected to detect the concentration of ca2 respectively and the removal efficiencies of ca2 under different freezing temperatures are shown by drawing fig 3 as shown in fig 3a when the freezing temperatures were 5 c 10 c 15 c 20 c and 25 c the concentration of ca2 in melt water was significantly lower than that in the raw water by 500 mg l and with the decrease of freezing temperature the concentration of ca2 in melt water tended to increase the concentration of ca2 in water under ice was obviously higher than that in the raw water by 500 mg l and with the decrease of freezing temperature the concentration of ca2 in the water under ice tended to decreases as shown in fig 3b when the freezing temperatures were 5 c 10 c 15 c 20 c and 25 c the residual rates i of ca2 in ice melting water were 1 82 3 02 4 58 6 30 and 9 65 the removal rates r of ca2 were 98 18 96 98 95 42 93 70 and 90 35 and the removal rates r were more than 90 the ca2 removal rate r was positively correlated with the freezing temperature when the freezing temperatures were 5 c 10 c 15 c 20 c and 25 c the ca2 concentration rates p were 176 76 174 68 173 03 169 47 165 61 the concentration rate p of ca2 was positively correlated with freezing temperature 3 1 3 removal efficiencies of ca2 under different initial concentration melt water and water under ice obtained under different initial concentration were collected to detect the concentration of ca2 respectively and the removal efficiencies of ca2 under initial concentration were shown by drawing fig 4 as shown in fig 4a when the initial concentration were 300 mg l 400 mg l 500 mg l 600 mg l and 700 mg l the concentration of ca2 in melt water was significantly lower than that in the raw water and with the increase of initial concentration the concentration of ca2 in melt water tended to increase the concentration of ca2 in water under ice was obviously higher than that in the raw water and with the increase of initial concentration the concentration of ca2 in the water under ice tended to increases as shown in fig 4b when the initial concentrations were 300 mg l 400 mg l 500 mg l 600 mg l and 700 mg l the residual rates i of ca2 in ice melting water were 5 35 4 80 4 58 5 07 and 5 17 the removal rates r of ca2 were 94 65 95 20 95 42 94 93 and 94 83 and the removal rates r were more than 90 the ca2 removal rate r

of ca2 under different initial ph melt water and water under ice obtained under different initial ph were collected to detect the concentration of ca2 respectively and the removal efficiencies of ca2 under initial concentration were shown by drawing fig 5 as shown in fig 5a when the initial ph values were 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 5 the concentration of ca2 in melt water was significantly lower than that in the raw water by 500 mg l and with the increase of initial ph the concentration of ca2 in melt water tended to decrease the concentration of ca2 in water under ice was obviously higher than that in the raw water by 500 mg l and with the increase of initial ph the concentration of ca2 in the water under ice tended to increases as shown in fig 5b when the initial ph values were 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 5 the residual rates i of ca2 in ice melting water were 5 36 4 58 4 04 3 94 and 3 69 the removal rates r of ca2 were 94 64 95 42 95 96 96 06 and 96 31 and the removal rates r were more than 90 the ca2 removal rate r was positively correlated with the initial ph when the initial ph values were 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 5 the ca2 concentration rates p were 168 75 173 03 174 31 177 08 and 179 03 the concentration rate p of ca2 was positively correlated with initial ph 3 2 relationship between the ca2 removal characteristic parameters and different experimental conditions in the freezing process redundancy analysis showed that the experimental conditions such as ice thickness freezing temperature initial concentration and initial ph could explain 90 7 of the characteristic parameters of ca2 removal the order of importance of effective explanation was as follows ice thickness initial concentration freezing temperature ph table 1 according to the redundancy analysis the correlation order between the experimental conditions such as ice thickness freezing temperature initial concentration and initial ph and the characteristic parameters of ca2 removal were obtained fig 6 the ca2 concentration in melt water was positively correlated with the initial ca2 concentration and negatively correlated with other experimental conditions the order of correlation was as follows freezing temperature initial concentration ice thickness ph the ca2 concentration in water under ice was positively correlated with the experimental conditions and the order of correlation was as follows ice thickness initial concentration freezing temperature ph the removal rates r of ca2 were positively correlated with ice thickness freezing temperature and initial ph and negatively correlated with initial concentration the order of correlation was as follows freezing temperature ice thickness ph initial concentration the concentration rates p of ca2 were positively correlated with the experimental conditions and the order of correlation was as follows ice thickness initial concentration freezing temperature ph 3 3 mechanisms of ca2 removal during the freezing process in pfc the detection range of ca2 in melt water was 9 121 mg l 48 239 mg l and the removal rate r of ca2 ranged was 90 35 98 18 however the range of ca2 detected in the water under ice was 465 581 mg l 1685 452 mg l and the concentration rate p of ca2 was 116 61 370 09 the mechanism can be explained from the perspective of energy from the microscopic point of view in the unfrozen state water molecules are relatively free 29 and ca2 in water are tightly surrounded by water molecules when the temperature decreases energy decreases and water molecules and ca2 begin to move at a certain time the position structure of water molecules and ca2 appears to be optimal fig 7 and the energy is optimal for the coexistence of water molecules and ca2 as the energy continues to decrease water molecules begin to transform into tiny ice crystals at this time water molecules not only interact with ca2 but also form ice crystal structures which result in insufficient free water molecules surrounding ca2 from the microscopic model ca2 are more stable in the water phase than in the ice phase due to the tendency of ions to move towards the stable phase ca2 will migrate from the unstable ice phase to the stable water phase in the ice and water two phase system ca2 in ice phase can be removed from a macroscopic point of view when water begins to freeze the free water molecules are transformed into regular ice structures and the ice and water two phase system appears in the solution when ca2 is combined with ice phase the energy that must be overcome is small 30 so the energy released by ca2 in combination with the ice is small and the energy of the whole system is high so the system formed in the ice phase is unstable when ca2 is combined with water phase the energy that must be overcome is large so the energy released by ca2 in combination with the water is large and the energy of the whole system is low so the system formed in the water phase is relatively stable therefore ca2 migrate from the ice to the water under ice the removal rate of ca2 in pfc is mainly related to hydrogen bonding which can be divided into hydrogen bonds formed between water clusters and hydrogen bonds formed within water clusters according to different hydrogen bond positions fig 7 there is a competitive relationship between them and the role of hydrogen bonds within clusters is far greater than that of hydrogen bonds between clusters 31 32 for the hydrogen bonds formed with water clusters pure ice has a tetrahedral crystal structure and is formed by water molecules associating through hydrogen bonds 33 the association among molecules will result in the release of a large amount of energy and the rate of energy release determines the growth rate of ice crystals when the energy is low the thermal motion of water molecules is relatively weak and the formation rate of hydrogen bonds is accelerated thus the formation rate of ice crystals is accelerated since the temperature is greater than the solution of the substance diffusion the solid liquid interface is dendritic growth and ca2 have no time to escape and become trapped in the dendritic space to form ice cells 34 fig 8 higher growth rate will lead to more complex branching in ice crystals resulting in narrower channels higher flow resistance and less ca2 discharge 35 the freezing temperature and ice thickness affect the energy release rate because the increase in ice sheet thickness hinders the heat exchange between the water body under ice and the outside world when the temperature is higher and the ice thickness is larger the growth rate of ice crystals is lower in the case of slow growth the size of each ice crystal does not change much and ca2 and water molecules form a relatively balanced relationship between the ice and water two phase system the volume of newly formed ice crystals increases but the ability to capture ca2 decreases 32 therefore with the increase of ice thickness and freezing temperature the removal rate of ca2 increases in addition hydrogen bonds between water clusters also affect the removal ability of ca2 in the ice and water two phase system for the hydrogen bonds formed between water clusters when the solution concentration increases the effect of hydrogen bonds between clusters increases the diffusion coefficient decreases more granular ice crystals are formed and the surface area of ice crystals increases 36 although more ca2 have no time to escape and be captured in the ice body at the early stage of icing with the increase in ice thickness the crystal grows at a uniform speed and ca2 continue to migrate and the increase of ca2 in the ice is much smaller than that in the water under ice similarly an increase in ph can lead to a fundamental change in the structure of water clusters in ca2 solutions with increased ph the distance between cao atoms decreases which makes the hydration number of ca2 in the electrolyte solution decrease 37 38 the rate of ca2 escaping to the water is accelerated which makes it difficult to capture with ice bodies and there are fewer ca2 left in the ice body after freezing therefore with the increase of initial concentration and initial ph the removal rate of ca2 increases 4 conclusion the following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results obtained from the study during the freezing process of pfc ca2 migrates from the ice to the water under ice and the ca2 in the ice could be removed and the ice could be purified pfc has a good effect on the treatment of wastewater containing ca2 with different concentrations and ph by controlling the conditions when the freezing temperature was 5 c the ice thickness was 12 cm and the initial concentration was 500 mg l and the ph was 7 the removal rate was 98 the removal rates r were positively correlated with the ice thickness freezing temperature and initial ph in other words the higher the ice thickness freezing temperature and initial ph were the better the removal rates of ca2 were in the process of removing ca2 by pfc the ice thickness and initial concentration could explain 90 4 which has a good correlation with the experimental results freezing temperature and initial ph could only explain 0 3 which was weakly correlated with the experimental results the ability of ca2 removal was related to the hydrogen bond and the change of energy would affect the change of hydrogen bond in varying degrees the change of hydrogen bond was different under different conditions the freezing temperature and ice thickness mainly affected the hydrogen bond within clusters the initial concentration and ph mainly affected the hydrogen bond between clusters the effect of hydrogen bond within clusters was much greater than that of hydrogen bond between clusters credit

13148,the easy separation of the microalgal bacterial biomass is crucial during wastewater treatment aggregates present excellent settling properties to enhance biomass separation this paper evaluated the influence of solids retention time srt on the formation of microalgal bacterial aggregates during the treatment of municipal wastewater in continuous high rate algal ponds hrap three srt 6 12 and 18 days were studied in two 80 l hrap operated at a fixed hydraulic retention time of 6 days the aggregates formation was characterized by evaluating size distribution settling properties and biochemical composition while the performance of the hrap was evaluated considering the organic matter suspended solids nitrogen and phosphorous removal it was evidenced that the increment in the srt in continuous hrap favored the formation of the granular structures and settling properties impacting therefore in the effective solids separation no significant differences were found for cod removal and bromatological characteristics for the three srt evaluated however the increment on the srt significantly affected the removal of n nh4 p po4 3 and suspended solids in the effluent obtaining the best performances for an srt of 12 days it was found that the srt imposes a community selectivity allowing the formation of the aggregates the increase in solids retention time induced the change from floccular aggregates to granules with an increment in the settling velocity up to 7 4 m h 1 microbiological characterization showed that aggregation depends on filamentous algae cyanobacteria and diatoms developed when the hrap is operated under an srt higher than 12 day graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aggregate solids retention time cyanobacteria microalgae wastewater 1 introduction microalgae bacteria systems have been widely studied due to the advantages that microalgae bacteria interactions offer during wastewater treatment microalgae could fix nutrients and co2 as a photosynthetic microorganism providing o2 to aerobic bacteria for organic matter degradation 1 5 in this sense this technology was proven to treat different effluents as piggery agroindustry and municipal wastewater reaching nutrient and organic matter removals over 90 0 2 6 7 besides it is possible to approach the microalgae bacteria biomass based on biomass composition to obtain value added products 6 7 however biomass recovery has been seen as the main limitation for biomass separation due to microalgae s low settling velocities usually recovered by centrifugation filtration ultrafiltration and chemical flocculation 8 9 the combination of bacteria in activated sludge with microalgae for wastewater treatment has been reported to generate significant interest in recent years due to the formation of microalga bacteria aggregates which can be easily recovered from the medium for simple methods such as sedimentation by gravity 10 14 different environmental and operational factors influence the development of those aggregates including the organic to inorganic carbon ratio 10 the microalga to activated sludge ratio 12 the hydraulic retention time hrt 14 15 the type of wastewater and the availability of the nutrients 16 the temperature 16 and irradiance levels 14 17 it has been proposed that the formation of microalga bacteria aggregates is related to extracellular polymeric substances secreted by algae and bacteria under different stress conditions and by the solids retention time srt imposed in the system 15 18 also the biomass s aggregation has been associated with some specific microalgae bacteria communities park et al 19 observed an increase in the sedimentability and aggregates stability related to diatoms and a large microalga in the biomass zhang et al 20 observed a significant contribution to the formation and stability of algal bacterial granules when the community is enriched with betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria flavobacterium bacterial classes and chlorophyta trebouxiophyceae and bacillariophyceae algae classes in more recent years milfestred et al 21 reported the importance of cyanobacteria in the formation of photogranules mentioning that cyanobacteria are necessary for the aggregation process in such a context communities changes can be obtained by controlling the srt the importance of having aggregates during municipal wastewater treatment is crucial to have a process in which the biomass can be easily separated and thus proper organic matter nutrients and solids removal could be achieved the microalgal bacteria treatment could be a simple and non expensive municipal wastewater treatment for application in small or rural communities where not much technification is required in this sense the srt is an important parameter related to biomass growth valigore et al 15 using sequencing batch reactors found that the longer srt and slow growth rates likely enhanced sedimentation compared to shorter srt the influence of srt for aggregates formation in continuous reactors is still scarce in the literature moreover the communities changes reported in the literature are based on experiments with synthetic wastewater and the evaluation of communities changes when real wastewater is needed therefore this study aimed to evaluate the influence of solid retention on microalgae bacteria aggregates formation during municipal wastewater treatment in continuous high rate algal ponds hrap the microbial community evolution was followed and related to microscopic and physicochemical data for each srt evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was carried out using two identical hrap named r1 and r2 to show the replicability of the microalgae bacteria system the hrap were made of fiberglass with a total capacity of 80 l 50 l working volume and coupled to a 3 l settler hrap were equipped with a six blade paddlewheel driven by a motor engine at 10 rpm to ensure mixing resulting in a liquid velocity of 0 2 m s 1 the reactors were fed with municipal wastewater and operated continuously under laboratory conditions with photoperiods 12 12 light dark provided by 14 cold light lamps tecno lite mexico for 200 Œºmol m 2 s 1 of irradiance and a fix hrt of 6 days fig 1 the temperature varied between 20 and 22 c and the ph was 8 4 0 4 the previous methodology reported by arcila and buitr√≥n 14 was applied for the start up acclimatization and reactors stability this methodology consists of inoculating the reactors with a 5 l mixture 1 1 w w of activated sludge and a native microalgae consortium containing mainly acutodesmus and chlorella 14 and using secondary effluent as a substrate after inoculation the reactors were operated in batch for 10 days and after this time the operation mode was changed to continuous feeding the reactors with municipal wastewater in this paper the hydraulic hrt and solids retention time srt were uncoupled organic carbon and nutrient removal are dependent on the hrt imposed in this study the hrt was fixed in 6 days because in previous works a high nitrogen removal under this hrt was evidenced 14 by recycling the biomass three srt of 6 12 and 18 days were tested to evaluate the influence of this parameter on the wastewater treatment and the formation of microalgae bacteria aggregates those srt were based on the growth characteristics and the aggregation process observed in batch reactors where no significant differences in settling characteristics were found between str

was made using excel software tools 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment the performance of the hrap was analyzed considering the organic matter as soluble cod and nutrients n nh4 n no3 n no2 and p po4 3 table 2 shows the results obtained for r1 and r2 under the three srt evaluated the r1 and r2 hrap results obtained at the three srt were subjected to an anova Œ± 0 05 results showed that obtained data pairs do not show a significant difference between reactors in all the cases therefore it was considered that the results from both reactors are duplicates no influence of the srt on the cod removal was found soluble cod concentrations in the effluent were always under 63 mg l 1 for all the srt evaluate the removal as soluble cod varied from 87 to 91 for the three srt 6 12 and 18 days and both reactors r1 and r2 the anova analysis indicated no significant difference Œ± 0 05 between the three srt and cod removal such behavior suggests that organic matter removal is not associated with srt similar results were observed in a membrane microalgal bacterial reactor treating wastewater since srt had no substantial impact on cod removal 26 microalgae bacteria systems are described as a mutualistic interaction between algae and aerobic bacteria where bacteria use the oxygen provided by microalgae to oxidize organic matter in this sense according to literature organic matter removal is mainly attributed to bacterial oxidation controlled by oxygen availability in the system 27 it is important to mention that during the experimentation period oxygen in the reactors was monitored observing dissolved oxygen concentration between 11 and 2 mg l 1 under the illuminated and dark periods respectively indicating that under illuminated conditions supersaturation of dissolved oxygen in both reactors always was present and no oxygen limitations existed during all the evaluated conditions according to posadas et al 27 during domestic wastewater treatment in a microalga bacteria biofilm organic matter removal is carried out by bacteria those authors found no significant difference in organic matter removal when a control reactor with only bacteria and another with microalga bacteria were compared sustaining the theory that the removal is carried out only by bacteria the increment on the srt significantly affected the removal of n nh4 p po4 3 and

days trebouxiophyceae which most abundant genus is chlorella presented a relative abundance of up to 80 however when the srt was increased to 12 days trebouxiophycea abundance decreased up to 10 and more than 60 of the algae species were composed mainly of filamentous algae and diatoms being stigeoclonium and bacillariophyceae finally for an srt of 18 days trebouxiophycea practically disappeared being stigeoclonium and bacillariophyceae the more abundant community 60 fig 5a as previously discussed the morphology of the aggregates depends on the srt at an srt of 6 days the smaller aggregates

13148,the easy separation of the microalgal bacterial biomass is crucial during wastewater treatment aggregates present excellent settling properties to enhance biomass separation this paper evaluated the influence of solids retention time srt on the formation of microalgal bacterial aggregates during the treatment of municipal wastewater in continuous high rate algal ponds hrap three srt 6 12 and 18 days were studied in two 80 l hrap operated at a fixed hydraulic retention time of 6 days the aggregates formation was characterized by evaluating size distribution settling properties and biochemical composition while the performance of the hrap was evaluated considering the organic matter suspended solids nitrogen and phosphorous removal it was evidenced that the increment in the srt in continuous hrap favored the formation of the granular structures and settling properties impacting therefore in the effective solids separation no significant differences were found for cod removal and bromatological characteristics for the three srt evaluated however the increment on the srt significantly affected the removal of n nh4 p po4 3 and suspended solids in the effluent obtaining the best performances for an srt of 12 days it was found that the srt imposes a community selectivity allowing the formation of the aggregates the increase in solids retention time induced the change from floccular aggregates to granules with an increment in the settling velocity up to 7 4 m h 1 microbiological characterization showed that aggregation depends on filamentous algae cyanobacteria and diatoms developed when the hrap is operated under an srt higher than 12 day graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aggregate solids retention time cyanobacteria microalgae wastewater 1 introduction microalgae bacteria systems have been widely studied due to the advantages that microalgae bacteria interactions offer during wastewater treatment microalgae could fix nutrients and co2 as a photosynthetic microorganism providing o2 to aerobic bacteria for organic matter degradation 1 5 in this sense this technology was proven to treat different effluents as piggery agroindustry and municipal wastewater reaching nutrient and organic matter removals over 90 0 2 6 7 besides it is possible to approach the microalgae bacteria biomass based on biomass composition to obtain value added products 6 7 however biomass recovery has been seen as the main limitation for biomass separation due to microalgae s low settling velocities usually recovered by centrifugation filtration ultrafiltration and chemical flocculation 8 9 the combination of bacteria in activated sludge with microalgae for wastewater treatment has been reported to generate significant interest in recent years due to the formation of microalga bacteria aggregates which can be easily recovered from the medium for simple methods such as sedimentation by gravity 10 14 different environmental and operational factors influence the development of those aggregates including the organic to inorganic carbon ratio 10 the microalga to activated sludge ratio 12 the hydraulic retention time hrt 14 15 the type of wastewater and the availability of the nutrients 16 the temperature 16 and irradiance levels 14 17 it has been proposed that the formation of microalga bacteria aggregates is related to extracellular polymeric substances secreted by algae and bacteria under different stress conditions and by the solids retention time srt imposed in the system 15 18 also the biomass s aggregation has been associated with some specific microalgae bacteria communities park et al 19 observed an increase in the sedimentability and aggregates stability related to diatoms and a large microalga in the biomass zhang et al 20 observed a significant contribution to the formation and stability of algal bacterial granules when the community is enriched with betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria flavobacterium bacterial classes and chlorophyta trebouxiophyceae and bacillariophyceae algae classes in more recent years milfestred et al 21 reported the importance of cyanobacteria in the formation of photogranules mentioning that cyanobacteria are necessary for the aggregation process in such a context communities changes can be obtained by controlling the srt the importance of having aggregates during municipal wastewater treatment is crucial to have a process in which the biomass can be easily separated and thus proper organic matter nutrients and solids removal could be achieved the microalgal bacteria treatment could be a simple and non expensive municipal wastewater treatment for application in small or rural communities where not much technification is required in this sense the srt is an important parameter related to biomass growth valigore et al 15 using sequencing batch reactors found that the longer srt and slow growth rates likely enhanced sedimentation compared to shorter srt the influence of srt for aggregates formation in continuous reactors is still scarce in the literature moreover the communities changes reported in the literature are based on experiments with synthetic wastewater and the evaluation of communities changes when real wastewater is needed therefore this study aimed to evaluate the influence of solid retention on microalgae bacteria aggregates formation during municipal wastewater treatment in continuous high rate algal ponds hrap the microbial community evolution was followed and related to microscopic and physicochemical data for each srt evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was carried out using two identical hrap named r1 and r2 to show the replicability of the microalgae bacteria system the hrap were made of fiberglass with a total capacity of 80 l 50 l working volume and coupled to a 3 l settler hrap were equipped with a six blade paddlewheel driven by a motor engine at 10 rpm to ensure mixing resulting in a liquid velocity of 0 2 m s 1 the reactors were fed with municipal wastewater and operated continuously under laboratory conditions with photoperiods 12 12 light dark provided by 14 cold light lamps tecno lite mexico for 200 Œºmol m 2 s 1 of irradiance and a fix hrt of 6 days fig 1 the temperature varied between 20 and 22 c and the ph was 8 4 0 4 the previous methodology reported by arcila and buitr√≥n 14 was applied for the start up acclimatization and reactors stability this methodology consists of inoculating the reactors with a 5 l mixture 1 1 w w of activated sludge and a native microalgae consortium containing mainly acutodesmus and chlorella 14 and using secondary effluent as a substrate after inoculation the reactors were operated in batch for 10 days and after this time the operation mode was changed to continuous feeding the reactors with municipal wastewater in this paper the hydraulic hrt and solids retention time srt were uncoupled organic carbon and nutrient removal are dependent on the hrt imposed in this study the hrt was fixed in 6 days because in previous works a high nitrogen removal under this hrt was evidenced 14 by recycling the biomass three srt of 6 12 and 18 days were tested to evaluate the influence of this parameter on the wastewater treatment and the formation of microalgae bacteria aggregates those srt were based on the growth characteristics and the aggregation process observed in batch reactors where no significant differences in settling characteristics were found between str

that obtained data pairs do not show a significant difference between reactors in all the cases therefore it was considered that the results from both reactors are duplicates no influence of the srt on the cod removal was found soluble cod concentrations in the effluent were always under 63 mg l 1 for all the srt evaluate the removal as soluble cod varied from 87 to 91 for the three srt 6 12 and 18 days and both reactors r1 and r2 the anova analysis indicated no significant difference Œ± 0 05 between the three srt and cod removal such behavior suggests that organic matter removal is not associated with srt similar results were observed in a membrane microalgal bacterial reactor treating wastewater since srt had no substantial impact on cod removal 26 microalgae bacteria systems are described as a mutualistic interaction between algae and aerobic bacteria where bacteria use the oxygen provided by microalgae to oxidize organic matter in this sense according to literature organic matter removal is mainly attributed to bacterial oxidation controlled by oxygen availability in the system 27 it is important to mention that during the experimentation period oxygen in the reactors was monitored observing dissolved oxygen concentration between 11 and 2 mg l 1 under the illuminated and dark periods respectively indicating that under illuminated conditions supersaturation of dissolved oxygen in both reactors always was present and no oxygen limitations existed during all the evaluated conditions according to posadas et al 27 during domestic wastewater treatment in a microalga bacteria biofilm organic matter removal is carried out by bacteria those authors found no significant difference in organic matter removal when a control reactor with only bacteria and another with microalga bacteria were compared sustaining the theory that the removal is carried out only by bacteria the increment on the srt significantly affected the removal of n nh4 p po4 3 and tss in the effluent the best performance was observed under an srt of 12 days having an average effluent concentration of 1 0 0 5 mg n nh4 l 1 22 0 3 1 mg p po4 3 l 1 and 92 5 6 0 mg tss l 1 moreover

13149,the performance of a lab scale anaerobic membrane distillation bioreactor an mdbr system was evaluated treating high strength synthetic textile wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of 3000 130 mg l a novel hybrid process incorporating membrane distillation in a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor was developed at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures and instigated the an mdbr process attained 99 99 inorganic salt rejection irrespective of the operating temperatures and high initial flux between 5 9 and 11 5 l m2 h lmh at 35 50 c removal efficiencies of cod and color were in the range of 40 69 and 43 74 respectively in an anaerobic bioreactor whereas overall md performance was in the range of 99 0 9 for cod as well as color among the four temperatures 40 c exhibited the optimum performance for 47 days with the average cod and color removal efficiencies of 99 0 9 respectively with steady biogas production furthermore the conductivity of an mdbr was maintained at 4 0 0 5 ms cm using low cost woven fiber microfiltration wf mf coupled with an mdbr and the flux was optimized at 2 lmh the removal efficiency of nh4 1 n was greater in the range of 89 to 93 at mesophilic temperatures while smaller in the range of 79 to 86 at thermophilic temperatures by maintaining ph between 6 8 and 7 2 the concentration of po4 3 p in the permeate water was near zero showing that po4 3 can be rejected completely by the md membrane due to membrane biofouling and scaling wetting was observed for different durations at different temperatures

freshwater sources are depleting worldwide due to continuous growth in population climate change urbanization industrial and agricultural activities to sustain the desired living standards which resulted in the discovery of alternative water resources 1 2 the world s two thirds population may be facing a shortage of water by 2025 according to world wildlife fund wwf 3 moreover the direct discharge of wastewater in water bodies is due to the lack of wastewater treatment and reuse technologies resulting in deterioration of the environment causing environmental pollution and serious impacts on human health 4 the generation of wastewater in public and industrial divisions can therefore be investigated as a potential solution for industrial water makeup to put it simply the treatment of wastewater can be an in place approach for reusing and recovering the polluted water sources generally for irrigation and industrial purposes 5 the textile industry plays an important role in the industrial sector particularly in developing countries and consumes a substantial amount of freshwater chemicals and synthetic dyes due to the limited absorption of dyes by fabrics a considerable amount of highly contaminated and colored wastewater about 200 to 350 m3 ton of final textile product is generated 6 the most critical disadvantage of untreated dye effluent discharge is its adverse impacts on the plant photosynthetic process which is due to low oxygen consumption and light penetration which in return affects the aquatic life 7 in addition to a huge quantity of water and dyes the textile effluent also contains toxic chemicals like stabilizing agents detergents caustic soda degradable inorganic and organic salts heavy metals and sizing agents which can lead to high turbidity and high chemical oxygen demand cod 8 based on the production of toxic effluent the textile industry among many industrial sectors is the main source of pollution to the environment and can be categorized as great risk hazardous wastewater 9 the textile sector is most important among pakistani industries accounting for around 65 of the country s total export 10 pakistan being a developing country generates plenty of highly contaminated textile wastewater generated through wet processes which are directly discharged into freshwater streams resulting in a significant level of toxicity for terrestrial and aquatic life textile dyes are an important constituent in textile effluent generally synthetic in structure and extremely soluble in water furthermore it was determined that 10 to 15 of these dyes are discharged in the effluent streams because of poor dying processes contaminating a major portion of ground and surface water 11 12 such dyes are classified according to their i chromophore color producing components such as azo nn carbonyl co and ii auxo chrome such as carboxyl cooh amino group nh2 and hydroxyl oh 6 as a result treatment of dyes is a principal requirement to prevent environmental pollution and this is the reason that textile industries in various countries are often required by environmental regulation to treat strictly these recalcitrant compounds before releasing textile wastewater in waterbodies therefore to deal with the impending disaster caused by the environmental pollution by the textile sector scientists and researchers are taking interest in zero liquid discharge zld and developing appropriate as well as cost effective treatment technologies for the treatment and reuse of textile dye effluent 9 13 several technologies for the treatment of combined textile wastewater have been proposed since 1990 including biological aerobic anaerobic and anoxic adsorption on activated carbon coagulation and flocculation chlorination or oxidation by ozone and membrane systems 14 15 some major textile customers are putting pressure on the sector to comply with zero hazardous discharge of chemicals and they have rejected chemical treatment as a subsequent treatment of dyeing wastewater because of the generation of environmentally destructive sludge residues 16 due to low operating cost and good efficacy biological treatment is the favorable approach for removing pollutants and high strength organic components from textile wastewater however due to extended retention time and larger footprint conventional biological treatment methods are not suitable as on site treatment facilities because of the toxicity and recalcitrant behavior of azo dyes towards micro organisms 13 17 previous research has demonstrated that certain dyes are extremely resistant to aerobic biological systems and require extended hydraulic retention times hrt for their breakdown resulting in significant energy consumption and aeration cost 18 therefore it is preferred to employ anaerobic technologies for the treatment of textile wastewater since an anaerobic condition promotes the breakdown of strong bonds among dye compounds anaerobic processes have the advantage of producing less sludge requiring less energy owing to the absence of aeration and energy recovery in the form of biogas 19 21 but the performance of anaerobic micro organisms in terms of low quality effluent due to slow growth rate has forever been the fundamental challenge for the anaerobic process to treat high strength textile wastewater thus innovative technologies like the integration of physical and biological processes are in demand with a small footprint cost effective and steady long term operation 17 22 the advancement of membrane processes has resulted in the maturation of the membrane bioreactors mbrs which are extensively utilized for both industrial and municipal wastewater treatment 22 23 anaerobic membrane bioreactors an mbrs have recently been recommended due to benefits such as higher effluent quality increased methane transformation and lower biosolids output 24 25 these systems however encountered significant problems such as high capital and operational cost extensive membrane fouling and limited water flux 26 membrane distillation bioreactor is also known as mdbr is an innovative and high retention mbr technology in which md membrane serves as a barrier to retain the mixed liquor and prevent the penetration of recalcitrant and low molecular weight compounds which indicates that the organic retention time ort can be much longer than the hydraulic retention time hrt by giving more time for degradation of recalcitrant compounds 27 28 on the other hand conventional mbr has hrt equal to ort 27 there are various benefits of combining biological processes with md whereas md provides total rejection of all non volatile solutes since mass transfer occurs in a gaseous phase thus the md process can be initiated directly using the available heat sources such as solar and waste heat in a mesophilic or thermophilic anaerobic process thus lowering the operational cost of the md system 29 30 another advantage of the mdbr system is that the permeability is not stimulated by external pressure resulting in reduced membrane fouling and breaking issues 31 therefore the mdbr hybrid system may perform better than other mbr processes for wastewater treatment while consuming less energy mdbr is a high solids retention membrane bioreactor technology that is comparable to the osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr which is another prominent innovative membrane bioreactor system 32 regarding system design mdbr offers a benefit over ombr to eliminate the need for reconcentration of the diluted draw solution which requires an onsite physical footprint and extra energy consumption moreover unlike ombr mdbr is substantially less susceptible to increases in reactor salinity which can worsen the permeation performance and enhance the membrane fouling 33 only limited research on lab scale aerobic mdbr has been conducted so far it was discovered that a single step mdbr system could provide high quality distillate water with a consistent flux that was equivalent to that produced by an mbr reverse osmosis mbr ro system 34 35 most trace organic components in the effluent were also removed by the mdbr 29 however during long term operations membrane fouling and wetting occurred and the salt accumulation might influence the microorganism activities negatively 29 36 only one study so far has been conducted using submerged hollow fiber md membrane in a thermophilic anaerobic bioreactor to treat wastewater 22 to the best of the author s knowledge no study has been conducted to compare the mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures in an mdbr treating the textile wastewater under a controlled salinity environment using the wf mf system considering the climatic conditions summer and winter of pakistan in this study the performance of a novel hybrid an mdbr was assessed the biological stability of an mdbr under mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures and the overall performance in terms of fundamental water quality as well as cod color removal and volumetric biogas output were analyzed the effect of increasing the temperature from 35 to 50 c on the efficacy of anaerobic treatment was also investigated moreover the sludge characteristics including mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss mixed liquor suspended solids mlss soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps were inspected employing different temperatures through this hybrid system 2 materials and methods 2 1 membranes in this experiment a flat sheet hydrophobic microporous membrane membrane solutions china was used the main md membrane properties include an active layer comprising of 12 Œºm thick layer of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe having a pore size of 0 45 Œºm employed on the polypropylene pp supporting layer and a porosity of 70 37 in addition a flat sheet wf mf with a pore size of 1 to 3 Œºm made of polyester material was also used 38 2 2 feed water characteristics synthetic textile wastewater having chemical oxygen demand cod of 3000 130 mg l color 1000 100 pt co platinum cobalt and c n p 100 10 1 was used the basis on a real textile wastewater recipe reported in the earlier study 17 39 for the preparation of synthetic textile feed analytical grade chemicals were used and table 1 summarizes the recipe of synthetic wastewater the electrical conductivity and ph of synthetic wastewater feed were 3 8 0 2 ms cm and 7 2 0 2 respectively this study employed reactive dyes of three types comprising cibacron yellow c r 01 cibacron blue p 3rgr and methylene blue which are used normally in textile industries dimethylamine sulphonic acid and azo groups are classified by these textile dyes as a result the actual condition of the dye wastewater provided by the textile industry was demonstrated by combining these commercial grade textile dyes in synthesis wastewater feed 2 3 description of the experimental setup a lab scale an mdbr attached with wf mf setup was established as shown in schematic fig 1 consisting of a distillate tank a feed tank and two biological reactors the md membrane module was immersed in a 4 21 liter l working volume of the 1st bioreactor an mdbr to remove salt buildup due to feed salinity accumulation from 1st bioreactor another bioreactor wf mf with a 3 81 l effective capacity was installed a flat sheet md membrane arrangement was employed on an acrylic plate and frame module with an effective area of 0 043 m2 in an anaerobic bioreactor dimensions of the membrane module comprised of 12 5 cm width and 26 5 cm length to enhance the contact time of distillate within the md module five baffles with 5 mm thickness of each were provided as illustrated in fig 1 a closed loop for distillate was established which was connected to the membrane on both sides of the module at the an mdbr side the volume change of distillate was measured after every 5 min using a digital weight scale ux 6200 h shimadzu japan attached to a laptop to determine the flux of the md membrane the treated effluent from the an mdbr system was collected in the distillate tank and this treated effluent can be used for water reuse applications the membrane was installed on the module with an active layer configuration facing the hot feed side to measure the conductivity in the distillate tank and an mdbr inline conductivity meters ranging from 0 to 10 000 Œºs cm komatsu japan were connected the required flow rate for the recirculation of distillate was maintained by a peristaltic pump l s 7524 45 masterflex usa through a membrane module and recirculation was kept constant at 400 ml min 40 the synthetic textile feed was kept in a 10 liter plastic tank the feed tank was connected by a level controller 61 f omron level switch japan to transport the synthetic textile feed through gravity in the an md bioreactor to maintain the four different temperatures 35 40 45 and 50 c in the an mdbr a temperature controller e5cn r2tc omron japan with a heating rod made of stainless steel was used a chiller made by a local manufacturer was utilized to keep the distillate temperature at 20 1 c at the 2nd bioreactor wf mf side trans membrane pressure tmp was measured by tmp meter data logging 840099 sper scientific usa attached to the membrane port to extract the permeate a peristaltic pump bt 3002 j longer china was employed at the wf mf membrane port to provide the suction pressure to control the salinity in an mdbr another pump was utilized at 2 lmh optimized flux details are in section 3 1 for recirculation of sludge from the an mdbr to wf mf setup the 7 5 2 5 min filtration to relaxation mode frm was maintained and the frm was adjusted following previous research 38 the frm cycle was controlled with a timer dh48s omron china 2 4 experimental conditions this research was divided into two main stages i startup and sludge acclimatization at mesophilic 35 and 40 c and thermophilic 45 and 50 c temperatures and ii to investigate the performance of an mdbr coupled with wf mf system treating synthetic textile wastewater at the four temperatures at the start up an anaerobic seed sludge utilized for an mdbr wf mf was taken from the sediments of the constructed wetlands treating the domestic wastewater at the national university of sciences and technology nust islamabad pakistan ph and oxidative reduction potential orp of an anaerobic seed sludge were 6 8 0 2 and 428 15 mv respectively initially the seed sludge was maintained under a mesophilic temperature of 35 c for 60 days in the an mdbr without md membrane module and a separate bioreactor before the start up at the same time bioreactors were fed semi continuously with synthetic textile wastewater by keeping hydraulic retention time hrt at 12 h feeding in semi continuous mode led to solve the sludge buoyancy issue controlling reduction in ph and reducing the volatile fatty acid vfa production 41 after completing the acclimatization phase at a first mesophilic temperature of 35 c a membrane module was inserted in the an mdbr system and an experimental setup was initiated meanwhile the temperature in the 2nd bioreactor was raised stepwise according to the requirement for the an mdbr experiment and new sludge from the 2nd bioreactor was introduced for each experimental run in an mdbr a stepwise increase in temperature approach was adopted to develop the mesophilic 40 c and thermophilic 45 and 50 c conditions in the reactor a gradual temperature increase from mesophilic to thermophilic resulted in a steady thermophilic sludge digestion process that is more appropriate for methane generation 41 an mdbr setup was initially maintained at 12 hours hrt but due to the flux drop of md membrane hrt increased in an mdbr over time the sludge retention time of an mdbr has kept at 60 days and the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration was kept at 3800 100 at startup for each temperature nitrogen gas was applied in an mdbr before the startup and after membrane cleaning at a flow rate of 1 l min to sustain the anaerobic environment the initial volume of the distillate was taken 1 l in the distillate tank and a volume change was observed after every 24 h the collected distillate water was removed from the distillate tank for each experimental study at four different temperatures a new membrane was used experimental runs were stopped for membrane cleaning when the drop in flux reached about 80 of the initial flux to ensure optimum flux recovery the module was removed from the bioreactor and then by using tap water the membrane was first washed to remove sludge layers and other impurities that had developed on the membrane s surface followed by chemical cleaning for each run except 50 c for organic fouling biofouling 2 wt sodium hypochlorite naocl was used by soaking the membranes in a solution for 15 min followed by 2 wt citric acid solution for inorganic fouling 42 44 2 5 analytical methods the treatment efficiency of the an mdbr setup for each temperature was evaluated by investigating the distillate quality and conductivity in the distillate tank color removal was assessed by hatch method pt co method with a spectrophotometer dr 2400 hach co usa and cod removal by closed reflux method 45 for the sludge characteristics mlss mlvss alkalinity and vfa were determined using standard methods 45 orp and ph were analyzed by ph orp meter hi 83141 hanna instruments ltd uk nitrogen was assessed by ammonia distillation method udk 149 velp scientifica italy while phosphorous in term of orthophosphate was measured by standard method using uv visible spectrophotometer db 20 dynamics 45 biogas was measured with a 1 l capacity biogas collection bag dalian china attached to a bioreactor cation exchange resin method was applied to extract the extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp from the anaerobic sludge showing the concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates 46 to measure the concentration of carbohydrates dubois method utilizing phenol sulfuric acid reagent was used 47 to quantify the concentration of protein lowery method using folin ciocalteu s phenol reagent was used 48 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimizing the wf mf setup wf mf system was optimized to maintain the salinity level in an mdbr due to feeding accumulation same anaerobic condition was maintained in wf mf as in an mdbr synthetic textile wastewater with a conductivity of 10 0 5 ms cm without dyes was used to evaluate the performance in terms of salt removal of the system salt removal from the bioreactor at various fluxes is shown in table 2 fouling of membrane was evaluated using tmp meter for each filtration cycle based on a prior wf mf study five various fluxes 2 5 7 9 and 11 lmh were selected and their tmp profiles were investigated 49 the filtration process was stopped to determine the fouling of the membrane after reaching the tmp at 30 kpa and flux reduction around 70 of the starting flux a previous study also revealed that the wf mf setup was turned off for cleaning purposes after reaching the tmp at 50 kpa and drop in flux around 60 38 to evaluate the wf mf membrane s effectiveness in terms of salt buildup removal and membrane fouling a new membrane was employed for each water flux study by removing the membrane module from the reactor the activity was halted for physical cleaning the membrane was cleaned physically by carefully brushing it under running water the intrinsic membrane resistance rm was measured by performing chemical cleaning just once after each flux to compare the resistance of the virgin membrane 3 2 performance of mesophilic and thermophilic an mdbr processes 3 2 1 effect of feed temperatures on distillate flux and conductivity one of the primary criteria determining md permeation performance is the temperature differential between the distillate side and the membrane feed furthermore increasing the temperature of the reactor may potentially improve the activity of the microorganisms resulting in increased cod removal efficiency however at higher temperatures more organic fouling may occur which would have a negative impact on vapor mass transfer as a result understanding the impacts of reactor temperature on permeate quality and the performance of md is essential this experiment studied the influence of mesophilic 35 and 40 c and thermophilic 45 and 50 c temperatures of the an mdbr for a long period in terms of distillate flux and conductivity using synthetic textile feed increasing the temperature of the reactor has a significant impact on an mdbr flux performance due to the significantly higher vapor pressure created at the membrane surface interface as indicated by fig 2 fig 2 a d reveals that thermophilic temperatures 50 and 45 c exhibited high initial distillate flux of 11 6 0 5 and 9 9 0 5 lmh whereas mesophilic temperatures 40 and 35 c showed the initial fluxes of 7 9 0 3 and 5 9 0 3 lmh respectively ptfe hydrophobic membrane exhibited the average fluxes of about 10 to 14 lmh at a high temperature of approximately 50 to 60 c when using textile wastewater 50 flux was decreased over time in all four experiments as expected which was due to membrane fouling as revealed by other studies 22 an increase in feed temperature of 15 c from 35 to 50 c increased nearly 2 times of the initial flux from 5 9 0 3 to 11 6 0 5 lmh the observed flux decline in the distillate was consistent with earlier findings 22 a sticky cake layer was noticed at the membrane surface active layer at the feed side after the completion of each run the major contributor to the reduction in flux was supposed to be the development of a cake layer fouling on the membrane surface which was comprised of dissolved and suspended organic compounds induced by the results of microbial activities the concentrations of these fouling cake layers were determined in terms of smp and eps carbohydrates protein and detailed results are discussed in section 3 4 furthermore greater flux reductions in the bioreactor might be due to the enhanced production of microbial products associated with elevated temperatures because of increased microbial activity 22 51 fouling layer development obstructs heat transmission to the membrane surface lowering the interfacial temperature of feed as a result a decrease in distillate flux was observed 42 it was also stated that the observed drop in membrane flux was caused by a decrease in the partial pressure of water vapor over the salt solution 28 however rejection of salt in an mdbr at all feed temperatures was sustained at 99 99 for a long duration demonstrating the great removal effectiveness of the membrane technology moreover long duration and a small decrease in flux in an mdbr at 40 c demonstrated that a bioreactor temperature of 40 c was far more suitable practically for long term operation the principal objective of a membrane in an md process is to separate one aqueous stream from another liquid stream permitting volatile components to pass between the two streams failure of the membrane occurs when the liquid feed solution easily penetrates through the membrane a process known as pore wetting wetting reduces salt rejection and hence contaminates the distillate stream the most popular and simplest way for determining wetting is to measure the electrical conductivity of the distillate however the key limitation of this approach is that it determines wetting only once the feed has already fully permeated at least a portion of the membrane pores and polluted the distillate 52 the results show that the conductivity of the distillate increased rapidly after 15 days at 50 c run 25 days at 45 c runs 43 days at 40 c runs and 23 days at 35 c runs indicating the membrane pore wetting and rapid increase in conductivity was observed from 3 5 1 6 to 35 5 Œºs cm as shown in fig 2 a d furthermore a small increase in distillate flux was also observed indicating that membrane wetting occurred as liquid molecules penetrate through the wetted pores and this phenomenon also has been observed in various studies 53 55 membrane wetting is another fouling phenomenon specific to md which mainly relates to the infiltration of contaminated feed water via the pore structure to the distillate side in addition to other methods a decrease in membrane surface hydrophobicity through deposition of surface active substances may result in membrane wetting in comparison with mesophilic temperatures experiments thermophilic temperatures experiments exhibited rapid membrane wetting at 50 c membrane fouling and membrane wetting occurred after 15 days and a similar trend was shown by another study that at elevated temperature the membrane was replaced at a frequency of 20 to 30 days because of wetting and fouling 56 earlier studies have shown that distillate water flux was affected due to md biofouling by enhancing a temperature b concentration polarization and c pore wetting 22 28 54 57 furthermore biofouling was also demonstrated to cause a decrease in water vapor pressure as well as some hydraulic resistance owing to pore blockage and an extra layer of biofilm thus it was suggested that mesophilic temperatures could be used to avoid more biofouling although it has impaired distillate water flux 57 another study confirmed that the degree of membrane wetting was limited at lower feed temperatures which facilitate the system for long term operation 58 flux recovery of md membrane was observed after applying cleaning methods as mentioned in section 2 5 when the distillate flux decreased owing to biofouling and inorganic fouling previous literature also revealed that hybrid aerobic anaerobic md operations may have both types of fouling mechanisms 22 42 as demonstrated in fig 2 a c 35 c has the maximum flux recovery of 84 8 followed by 40 c and 45 c with 78 8 and 75 2 respectively after membrane cleaning results revealed that the maximum flux recovery was obtained at mesophilic temperatures while 45 c has less flux recovery as discussed above due to a large number of wet pores a rapid increase in distillate salinity was reported during biofouling at a thermophilic temperature of 50 c furthermore diffusion rises at higher temperatures since solutes accumulated in the distillate at a faster rate 57 one of the most efficient strategies to prevent wetting is to lower the pore size of the membrane though it is also noted that when the pore size of the membrane was reduced the flux also dropped the pore size of the md membrane must be as narrow as possible to avoid wettability of membrane pores which clashes with the necessity for higher permeability 42 3 3 an mdbr removal efficiency 3 3 1 cod and color removal removal of cod and color from an mdbr at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures were evaluated concurrently after 2 days as indicated by figs 3 and 4 cod concentrations mg l in md distillate influent and supernatant along with cod removal efficiencies of md distillate are summarized in fig 3 the anaerobic environment in an mdbr was well sustained under thermophilic as well as mesophilic temperatures under constant conductivity level of 4 0 5 Œºs cm via wf mf system it was observed that in an anaerobic bioreactor at 35 c temperature the lowest and highest cod removal efficiencies were 39 9 and 56 47 respectively also 40 c temperature demonstrated the minimum and maximum cod removal efficiencies of 43 3 and 58 9 while at 45 c temperature with 47 2 to 62 8 and at 50 c temperature with 51 6 to 68 9 fig 3 depicts cod concentrations in mixed liquor ranging from 940 40 to 1820 40 mg l for varied feed temperatures increased accumulation of cod was detected in mixed liquor at both mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures and this cod accumulation was caused by the high retention mechanism of md membranes fig 3 a d indicates that the rise in cod concentration in mixed liquor differs depending on the mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the maximum reduction in cod removal efficiency from the bioreactor was noticed after the middle of each run and was reduced towards the end more cod accumulation was observed at mesophilic temperatures as compared to thermophilic due to the low degradation rate thus the drop in removal efficiency and higher cod concentrations in mixed liquor towards each run attributed mostly to the production of aromatic amines because of anaerobic degradation of azo dyes which negatively influence the anaerobes as stated previously 59 60 nevertheless the anaerobic process demonstrated impressive cod removal throughout operation with an average removal efficiency in the range of 53 69 compared to prior studies that revealed cod removal efficiencies between 50 and 76 59 61 also fig 3 depicts the removal efficiencies and concentration of cod in md distillate after circulating through the md membrane the removal efficiencies from md distillate were observed in the range of 98 2 99 9 during all four runs moreover concentrations of cod in md distillate ranged between 0 6 0 1 and 20 4 mg l at both mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures indicating a remarkable removal of cod from md membrane in addition a small quantity of cod with a concentration less than 20 4 mg l in md distillate might be due to the volatilization of vfas precious research has found similar cod removal efficiency from md permeate when treating various types of wastewaters 14 22 62 this indicated that integrating biological process and md membrane an mdbr can effectively treat textile wastewater with a high cod concentration of 3000 130 mg l for a long term duration despite the excellent retention mechanism of the md membrane cod rise in the md distillate was noticed at the end of each run this might be due to the pore wetting causing penetration of organic contaminants from feed solution to md distillate as described by previous studies 14 22 42 62 as mentioned earlier due to a large number of wet pores and a decrease in membrane surface hydrophobicity through deposition of surface active substances the sudden increase in distillate conductivity was also observed at end of each run which confirmed that the wetting phenomenon occurred the rapid increase in the permeate ec suggests liquid transfer from the feed into the permeate through wetted membrane pores this was confirmed by the observation of cod and color in the permeate tank at the end of each run the concentration of color pt co in md distillate feed and mixed liquor along with color removal efficiencies of md distillate are summarized in fig 4 it was observed that in an anaerobic bioreactor at 35 c temperature the lowest and highest color removal efficiencies were 43 2 to 55 respectively also 40 c temperature has demonstrated the minimum and maximum color removal efficiencies of 51 3 and 60 9 while at 45 c temperature with 54 1 to 67 4 and at 50 c temperature with 56 2 to 73 6 fig 4 depicts color concentrations in mixed liquor ranging from 280 30 to 530 30 pt co for varied feed temperatures this showed that the textile dyes could be degraded by anaerobic microorganisms if there are no toxic components in a bioreactor like high saline environment due to accumulation of feed which normally inhibits microbial growth the color removal during the biological process owing to the cleavage of the azo bonds found in the textile wastewater resulting in aromatic amines formation 17 other experiments have shown that aromatic amines having functional hydroxyl and carboxyl groups might be mineralized under anaerobic circumstances 63 64 fig 4 a d indicates that the rise in color concentration in mixed liquor differs depending on the mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the maximum color removal efficiency from the bioreactor was noticed in the middle of each run and then reduced towards the end this is because the production of intermediates aromatic amines during the degradation inhibited the anaerobic microbes and lowered their effectiveness as previously explained and described in prior investigations 59 60 furthermore some variation in vfa alkalinity and ph during the continuous process may have a negative effect on color removal performances as discussed previously 65 temperature is a key factor and plays a significant role in the degradation of pollutant kinetics according to 66 the degradation rate is high at elevated temperatures hence higher degradation of dyes was detected more at thermophilic temperatures in comparison with mesophilic temperatures in this study according to another study the temperature of real textile wastewater ranges from 35 to 55 c which corresponds to the current study scenario 67 also fig 4 depicts the removal efficiencies and concentration of color in md distillate the removal efficiencies from md distillate were observed in the range of 98 5 99 9 during all four runs moreover concentrations of color in md distillate ranged between 5 2 and 65 4 mg l at both mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures indicating a remarkable removal of color from md membrane previous research has found similar color removal efficiency from md permeate 9 68 the generation of toxic intermediates during dye degradation for long duration significantly influenced biomass properties although the overall effectiveness of color removal from the an mdbr system remained steady despite the excellent retention mechanism of the md membrane a rise in color concentration in the md distillate was noticed at the end of each run this might be due to the pore wetting causing penetration of liquid molecules from feed solution to md distillate 3 3 2 nutrients removal table 3 shows the variations in nh4 1 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the influent md distillate and removal efficiency at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures the removal efficiency of nh 4 varied between 61 5 and 92 8 demonstrating that the md membrane rejected nh 4 at a lower rate than organic materials 50 62 69 70 this reduced removal efficiency is most likely due to the conversion of nh 4 to nh3 gas owing to its volatility in addition several studies found that the ph of the feed had a substantial influence on the rate of removal efficiency of readily ionized volatile compounds like ammonia also the temperature of the feed had a considerable effect on the rate of removal efficiency of readily ionized volatile compounds 50 ammonium ions tend to shift to volatile ammonia when ph and temperature increase the difference in partial pressure of ammonia gas between feed wastewater and permeate promotes ammonia transfer depending on the ph and temperature of the feed side higher feed temperatures may allow for greater ionization of bicarbonate ions hco3 into carbonate ions co3 2 resulting in a higher feed wastewater ph 71 furthermore raising the temperature of the feed wastewater should help the ammonium ion volatilize into ammonia gas which can readily flow through the hydrophobic membrane ammonium ions are converted more favorably into ammonia gas in the thermophilic bioreactor as compared to mesophilic bioreactors which may readily penetrate through the hydrophobic membrane to minimize the permeation of ammonia the ph of the bioreactor should be adjusted below 7 2 to sustain the retentate 56 in this work the removal efficiency of nh4 1 n was greater in the range of 89 4 to 92 7 at mesophilic temperatures while smaller in the range of 79 4 to 85 7 at thermophilic temperatures the improved efficiency at thermophilic temperatures in this study was due to ph maintained in the range of 6 75 7 25 which is in agreement with another study 71 the concentration of po4 3 p in the permeate water was near zero showing that po4 3 can be rejected completely by the md membrane 69 72 3 4 effect of temperatures on biomass characteristics figs 5 and 6 show the biomass characteristics at the beginning mid and end of all four runs mlvss and mlss are essential criteria in determining the efficacy of biological treatments one of the goals of the study among others was to establish a reactor at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions to observe the effect of temperature increase on sludge characteristics in terms of biomass concentration previous research has also shown that different temperature conditions in the bioreactor have a great influence on the microbial population and biomass suspended solids 22 56 fig 5 a b depicts the concentration of mlvss mlss and ratio of mlvss mlss in an mdbr for all four runs fig 5 a b demonstrated that during mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures concentration of mlss and mlvss increased for mesophilic temperatures mlss increased from 3812 to 3986 mg l and mlvss increased from 2112 to 2210 mg l during 35 c temperature with mlvss mlss ratio of 0 55 to 0 58 during 40 c temperature mlss increased from 3840 to 4235 mg l and mlvss increased from 2150 to 2413 mg l with mlvss mlss ratio of 0 56 to 0 59 similarly for thermophilic temperatures mlss increased from 3895 to 4442 mg l and mlvss increased from 2155 to 2810 mg l during 45 c temperature with mlvss mlss ratio of 0 56 to 0 63 during 50 c temperature mlss increased from 3990 to 4670 mg l and mlvss increased from 2335 to 3040 mg l with mlvss mlss ratio of 0 58 to 0 65 the concentrations of mlss and mlvss at thermophilic temperatures revealed that biomass growth was not much affected by intermediates during dye degradation due to the high degradation rate the small reduction in the mlvss mlss ratio for a mesophilic temperature at 35 c indicates that the formation of hazardous intermediates due to degradation of dyes for a long duration harmed the biomass in the bioreactor in earlier investigations an ideal mlvss mlss ratio of 0 45 to 0 65 was shown to be acceptable for anaerobic processes 65 73 organic foulants such as eps and smp are the most prominent substances responsible for membrane biofouling 56 62 74 biofouling is also caused by the accumulation and adsorption of eps and smp on the surface of the membrane and inside pores 21 protein and carbohydrates are the most prevalent components detected in both the eps and smp out of nucleic acids humic acid protein carbohydrates and lipids 75 in the bioreactor the sum of protein and carbohydrate concentrations was used to express eps and smp eps and smp concentrations in terms of carbohydrates and protein are shown in fig 6 a b for all four runs fig 6 a depicts eps concertation in the bioreactor for all four runs both at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures with time the eps at thermophilic temperatures both in terms of carbohydrate and protein concentrations significantly decreased while substantial amounts of eps were observed at mesophilic temperatures thus temperature increase reduces the microorganism s capacity to produce eps resulting in the death of active bacteria and the development of biodegradable debris these cell lysis and cell debris production results in the conversion of eps bound to eps soluble or smp 76 77 moreover fouling of membrane in thermophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor was significantly worse compared to mesophilic system ding et al 78 demonstrated that the temperature plays a significant role indicating that protein to carbohydrate ratio p c and eps release was higher at thermophilic temperatures resulting in 5 to 10 times greater filtration resistance than the mesophilic temperatures at thermophilic temperatures eps decreased from 181 9 mg gvss 45 c run to 141 9 mg gvss 50 c run while at mesophilic temperatures eps increased from 205 2 mg gvss 40 c run to 239 53 mg gvss 35 c run the carbohydrate and protein concentrations of smp in the bioreactor increased with an increase in temperature as shown in fig 6 b therefore the increase in smp in the bioreactor was mainly due to the thermophilic temperature of an mdbr thermophilic temperatures exhibit more smp as compared to mesophilic temperatures due to the high degradation of organic compounds and cell lysis 28 70 at mesophilic temperatures smp increased from 60 4 mg l 35 c run to 84 3 mg l 40 c run while at thermophilic temperatures smp increased from 120 5 mg l 45 c run to 144 6 mg l 50 c run previous research has found that increasing temperature in the reactor resulted in higher proportions of smp in the supernatant 62 77 several investigations have also shown that smp is a major source of membrane fouling in terms of pore blocking 79 according to one study 80 both eps extracted from cake layer sludge soluble eps or smp and eps extracted from bulk sludge loosely bond extra polymeric substances lb eps induced the greatest flux decline whereas another study 21 explained that cake layer noticed on the surface of the membrane in anaerobic operation has lower removability than cake layer found in aerobic processes similarly this study revealed that the increase in smp was most noticeable at higher temperatures as discussed earlier hence a maximum flux drop was observed from the 45 c runs this might indicate that the buildup of more smp in the supernatant led to worse pore blocking and cake layer development with greater flux decrease 78 79 3 5 biogas production and anaerobic stability characteristics the successful biogas production at both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions using an mdbr may perhaps contribute to energy improved efficient system the temperature has a significant impact on biogas generation as demonstrated by results fig 7 a depicts the findings of volumetric biogas generation in ml l day at each temperature among four temperatures the maximum biogas generation volume of 64 5 ml l day was attained at 50 c for 17 days operation while the least biogas volume of 45 1 ml l day was generated at 35 c for 27 days which can be due to the improved activity of microbial community at higher temperature resulting in rapid organic degradation and these results correlate with a previous study 22 40 c temperatures showed stable biogas production between 34 5 and 49 8 ml l day for a long duration as the rate of feed cod was proportional to the rate of md distillate flux therefore olr was high at elevated temperature than the lower one in an mdbr which indicated that the daily feed consumption organic loading rate was highly associated with the daily biogas volume 22 for long term operation the gas generation efficiency at 50 c deteriorated because of rapid decline in flux and olr the biogas yield in ml g cod removed was relatively stable throughout the operation regardless of the an mdbr temperatures as shown in fig 7 b furthermore the anaerobic behavior for biogas generation is mostly determined by the stability characteristics including ph orp and vfa alkalinity as shown in table 4 by offering appropriate conditions for the anaerobic microbial community stability characteristics play an important role in the production of biogas and the smooth running of an mdbr the results showed that throughout the experiments at all temperatures ph of the an mdbr was maintained between 6 72 and 7 28 and orp between 339 and 394 mv indicating a suitable anaerobic environment previous research has shown that by keeping orp and ph at specified values an optimal condition in the bioreactor was observed 39 65 furthermore a reduction in ph has been observed because of increased vfas buildup throughout the anaerobic phase to keep the ph of the reactor between 6 7 and 7 3 some alkalinity in the form of sodium bicarbonate nahco3 was added to the recipe at higher feed temperatures md membrane rejects alkaline salt which allows for greater ionization of bicarbonate ions hco3 into carbonate ions co3 2 resulting in a ph buffer in an mdbr 69 the overall alkalinity and vfa in an mdbr during all experimental runs were between 1570 55 mg l and 660 45 mg l having a vfa alkalinity ratio of 0 35 0 04 as shown in table 4 which indicates the improved performance of anaerobic bioreactor previous research has shown that vfa less than 1000 mg l and alkalinity more than 1000 mg l are best suited for anaerobic treatment 61 65 in prior research it was also discovered that the vfa alkalinity ratio was maintained in the range of 0 3 to 0 4 39 during each of the four experimental runs the concentration of vfa in the bioreactor decreased while the concentration of alkalinity increased this drop in vfa concentration is caused by the conversion of acetogenic microorganisms to methanogenic ones it was also concluded from previous research that a continued reduction in vfa was observed due to the formation of methanogenic microbes 39 4 conclusions in this study the performance of lab scale an mdbr system treating high strength synthetic textile wastewater at mesophilic 35 and 40 c and thermophilic 45 and 50 c temperatures was investigated the an mdbr process attained 99 99 inorganic salt rejection irrespective of the operating temperatures and high initial flux between 5 9 and 11 5 l m2 h lmh at 35 50 c overall an mdbr performance was in the range of 99 0 9 for cod and color removal among the four temperatures 40 c exhibited the optimum performance for 47 days with steady biogas production the removal efficiency of nh4 1 n was greater in the range of 89 4 to 92 7 at mesophilic temperatures while smaller in the range of 79 4 to 85 7 at thermophilic temperatures by maintaining ph between 6 75 and 7 25 the concentration of po4 3 p in the permeate water was near zero showing that po4 3 can be rejected completely by the md membrane due to membrane biofouling and scaling wetting was observed for different durations at different temperatures in an mdbr conductivity was maintained at 4 0 5 ms cm by integrating wf mf showing the effectiveness of wf mf in mitigating salinity buildup in bioreactor and enhancement of stable flux in an mdbr the distillate water from the an mdbr unit can be reused for a variety of purposes such as industrial processes and irrigation based on obtained results an mdbr is recommended as comparatively reliable technology producing high quality distillate and economic

graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic membrane distillation bioreactor textile wastewater treatment mesophilic temperature thermophilic temperature membrane wetting 1 introduction freshwater sources are depleting worldwide due to continuous growth in population climate change urbanization industrial and agricultural activities to sustain the desired living standards which resulted in the discovery of alternative water resources 1 2 the world s two thirds population may be facing a shortage of water by 2025 according to world wildlife fund wwf 3 moreover the direct discharge of wastewater in water bodies is due to the lack of wastewater treatment and reuse technologies resulting in deterioration of the environment causing environmental pollution and serious impacts on human health 4 the generation of wastewater in public and industrial divisions can therefore be investigated as a potential solution for industrial water makeup to put it simply the treatment of wastewater can be an in place approach for reusing and recovering the polluted water sources generally for irrigation and industrial purposes 5 the textile industry plays an important role in the industrial sector particularly in developing countries and consumes a substantial amount of freshwater chemicals and synthetic dyes due to the limited absorption of dyes by fabrics a considerable amount of highly contaminated and colored wastewater about 200 to 350 m3 ton of final textile product is generated 6 the most critical disadvantage of untreated dye effluent discharge is its adverse impacts on the plant photosynthetic process which is due to low oxygen consumption and light penetration which in return affects the aquatic life 7 in addition to a huge quantity of water and dyes the textile effluent also contains toxic chemicals like stabilizing agents detergents caustic soda degradable inorganic and organic salts heavy metals and sizing agents which can lead to high turbidity and high chemical oxygen demand cod 8 based on the production of toxic effluent the textile industry among many industrial sectors is the main source of pollution to the environment and can be categorized as great risk hazardous wastewater 9 the textile sector is most important among pakistani industries accounting for around 65 of the country s total export 10 pakistan being a developing country generates plenty of highly contaminated textile wastewater generated through wet processes which are directly discharged into freshwater streams resulting in a significant level of toxicity for terrestrial and aquatic life textile dyes are an important constituent in textile effluent generally synthetic in structure and extremely soluble in water furthermore it was determined that 10 to 15 of these dyes are discharged in the effluent streams because of poor dying processes contaminating a major portion of ground and surface water 11 12 such dyes are classified according to their i chromophore color producing components such as azo nn carbonyl co and ii auxo chrome such as carboxyl cooh amino group nh2 and hydroxyl oh 6 as a result treatment of dyes is a principal requirement to prevent environmental pollution and this is the reason that textile industries in various countries are often required by environmental regulation to treat strictly these recalcitrant compounds before releasing textile wastewater in waterbodies therefore to deal with the impending disaster caused by the environmental pollution by the textile sector scientists and researchers are taking interest in zero liquid discharge zld and developing appropriate as well as cost effective treatment technologies for the treatment and reuse of textile dye effluent 9 13 several technologies for the treatment of combined textile wastewater have been proposed since 1990 including biological aerobic anaerobic and anoxic adsorption on activated carbon coagulation and flocculation chlorination or oxidation by ozone and membrane systems 14 15 some major textile customers are putting pressure on the sector to comply with zero hazardous discharge of chemicals and they have rejected chemical treatment as a subsequent treatment of dyeing wastewater because of the generation of environmentally destructive sludge residues 16 due to low operating cost and good efficacy biological treatment is the favorable approach for removing pollutants and high strength organic components from textile wastewater however due to extended retention time and larger footprint conventional biological treatment methods are not suitable as on site treatment facilities because of the toxicity and recalcitrant behavior of azo dyes towards micro organisms 13 17 previous research has demonstrated that certain dyes are extremely resistant to aerobic biological systems and require extended hydraulic retention times hrt for their breakdown resulting in significant energy consumption and aeration cost 18 therefore it is preferred to employ anaerobic technologies for the treatment of textile wastewater since an anaerobic condition promotes the breakdown of strong bonds among dye compounds anaerobic processes have the advantage of producing less sludge requiring less energy owing to the absence of aeration and energy recovery in the form of biogas 19 21 but the performance of anaerobic micro organisms in terms of low quality effluent due to slow growth rate has forever been the fundamental challenge for the anaerobic process to treat high strength textile wastewater thus innovative technologies like the integration of physical and biological processes are in demand with a small footprint cost effective and steady long term operation 17 22 the advancement of membrane processes has resulted in the maturation of the membrane bioreactors mbrs which are extensively utilized for both industrial and municipal wastewater treatment 22 23 anaerobic membrane bioreactors an mbrs have recently been recommended due to benefits such as higher effluent quality increased methane transformation and lower biosolids output 24 25 these systems however encountered significant problems such as high capital and operational cost extensive membrane fouling and limited water flux 26 membrane distillation bioreactor is also known as mdbr is an innovative and high retention mbr technology in which md membrane serves as a barrier to retain the mixed liquor and prevent the penetration of recalcitrant and low molecular weight compounds which indicates that the organic retention time ort can be much longer than the hydraulic retention time hrt by giving more time for degradation of recalcitrant compounds 27 28 on the other hand conventional mbr has hrt equal to ort 27 there are various benefits of combining biological processes with md whereas md provides total rejection of all non volatile solutes since mass transfer occurs in a gaseous phase thus the md process can be initiated directly using the available heat sources such as solar and waste heat in a mesophilic or thermophilic anaerobic process thus lowering the operational cost of the md system 29 30 another advantage of the mdbr system is that the permeability is not stimulated by external pressure resulting in reduced membrane fouling and breaking issues 31 therefore the mdbr hybrid system may perform better than other mbr processes for wastewater treatment while consuming less energy mdbr is a high solids retention membrane bioreactor technology that is comparable to the osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr which is another prominent innovative membrane bioreactor system 32 regarding system design mdbr offers a benefit over ombr to eliminate the need for reconcentration of the diluted draw solution which requires an onsite physical footprint and extra energy consumption moreover unlike ombr mdbr is substantially less susceptible to increases in reactor salinity which can worsen the permeation performance and enhance the membrane fouling 33 only limited research on lab scale aerobic mdbr has been conducted so far it was discovered that a single step mdbr system could provide high quality distillate water with a consistent flux that was equivalent to that produced by an mbr reverse osmosis mbr ro system 34 35 most trace organic components in the effluent were also removed by the mdbr 29 however during long term operations membrane fouling and wetting occurred and the salt accumulation might influence the microorganism activities negatively 29 36 only one study so far has been conducted using submerged hollow fiber md membrane in a thermophilic anaerobic bioreactor to treat wastewater 22 to the best of the author s knowledge no study has been conducted to compare the mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures in an mdbr treating the textile wastewater under a controlled salinity environment using the wf mf system considering the climatic conditions summer and winter of pakistan in this study the performance of a novel hybrid an mdbr was assessed the biological stability of an mdbr under mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures and the overall performance in terms of fundamental water quality as well as cod color removal and volumetric biogas output were analyzed the effect of increasing the temperature from 35 to 50 c on the efficacy of anaerobic treatment was also investigated moreover the sludge characteristics including mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss mixed liquor suspended solids mlss soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps were inspected employing different temperatures through this hybrid system 2 materials and methods 2 1 membranes in this experiment a flat sheet hydrophobic microporous membrane membrane solutions china was used the main md membrane properties include an active layer comprising of 12 Œºm thick layer of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe having a pore size of 0 45 Œºm employed on the polypropylene pp supporting layer and a porosity of 70 37 in addition a flat sheet wf mf with a pore size of 1 to 3 Œºm made of polyester material was also used 38 2 2 feed water characteristics synthetic textile wastewater having chemical oxygen demand cod of 3000 130 mg l color 1000 100 pt co platinum cobalt and c n p 100 10 1 was used the basis on a real textile wastewater recipe reported in the earlier study 17 39 for the preparation of synthetic textile feed analytical grade chemicals were used and table 1 summarizes the recipe of synthetic wastewater the electrical conductivity and ph of synthetic wastewater feed were 3 8 0 2 ms cm and 7 2 0 2 respectively this study employed reactive dyes of three types comprising cibacron yellow c r 01 cibacron blue p 3rgr and methylene blue which are used normally in textile industries dimethylamine sulphonic acid and azo groups are classified by these textile dyes as a result the actual condition of the dye wastewater provided by the textile industry was demonstrated by combining these commercial grade textile dyes in synthesis wastewater feed 2 3 description of the experimental setup a lab scale an mdbr attached with wf mf setup was established as shown in schematic fig 1 consisting of a distillate tank a feed tank and two biological reactors the md membrane module was immersed in a 4 21 liter l working volume of the 1st bioreactor an mdbr to remove salt buildup due to feed salinity accumulation from 1st bioreactor another bioreactor wf mf with a 3 81 l effective capacity was installed a flat sheet md membrane arrangement was employed on an acrylic plate and frame module with an effective area of 0 043 m2 in an anaerobic bioreactor dimensions of the membrane module comprised of 12 5 cm width and 26 5 cm length to enhance the contact time of distillate within the md module five baffles with 5 mm thickness of each were provided as illustrated in fig 1 a closed loop for distillate was established which was connected to the membrane on both sides of the module at the an mdbr side the volume change of distillate was measured after every 5 min using a digital weight scale ux 6200 h shimadzu japan attached to a laptop to determine the flux of the md membrane the treated effluent from the an mdbr system was collected in the distillate tank and this treated effluent can be used for water reuse applications the membrane was installed on the module with an active layer configuration facing the hot feed side to measure the conductivity in the distillate tank and an mdbr inline conductivity meters ranging from 0 to 10 000 Œºs cm komatsu japan were connected the required flow rate for the recirculation of distillate was maintained by a peristaltic pump l s 7524 45 masterflex usa through a membrane module and recirculation was kept constant at 400 ml min 40 the synthetic textile feed was kept in a 10 liter plastic tank the feed tank was connected by a level controller 61 f omron level switch japan to transport the synthetic textile feed through gravity in the an md bioreactor to maintain the four different temperatures 35 40 45 and 50 c in the an mdbr a temperature controller e5cn r2tc omron japan with a heating rod made of stainless steel was used a chiller made by a local manufacturer was utilized to keep the distillate temperature at 20 1 c at the 2nd bioreactor wf mf side trans membrane pressure tmp was measured by tmp meter data logging 840099 sper scientific usa attached to the membrane port to extract the permeate a peristaltic pump bt 3002 j longer china was employed at the wf mf membrane port to provide the suction pressure to control the salinity in an mdbr another pump was utilized at 2 lmh optimized flux details are in section 3 1 for recirculation of sludge from the an mdbr to wf mf setup the 7 5 2 5 min filtration to relaxation mode frm was maintained and the frm was adjusted following previous research 38 the frm cycle was controlled with a timer dh48s omron china 2 4 experimental conditions this research was divided into two main stages i startup and sludge acclimatization at mesophilic 35 and 40 c and thermophilic 45 and 50 c temperatures and ii to investigate the performance of an mdbr coupled with wf mf system treating synthetic textile wastewater at the four temperatures at the start up an anaerobic seed sludge utilized for an mdbr wf mf was taken from the sediments of the constructed wetlands treating the domestic wastewater at the national university of sciences and technology nust islamabad pakistan ph and oxidative reduction potential orp of an anaerobic seed sludge were 6 8 0 2 and 428 15 mv respectively initially the seed sludge was maintained under a mesophilic temperature of 35 c for 60 days in the an mdbr without md membrane module and a separate bioreactor before the start up at the same time bioreactors were fed semi continuously with synthetic textile wastewater by keeping hydraulic retention time hrt at 12 h feeding in semi continuous mode led to solve the sludge buoyancy issue controlling reduction in ph and reducing the volatile fatty acid vfa production 41 after completing the acclimatization phase at a first mesophilic temperature of 35 c a membrane module was inserted in the an mdbr system and an experimental setup was initiated meanwhile the temperature in the 2nd bioreactor was raised stepwise according to the requirement for the an mdbr experiment and new sludge from the 2nd bioreactor was introduced for each experimental run in an mdbr a stepwise increase in temperature approach was adopted to develop the mesophilic 40 c and thermophilic 45 and 50 c conditions in the reactor a gradual temperature increase from mesophilic to thermophilic resulted in a steady thermophilic sludge digestion process that is more appropriate for methane generation 41 an mdbr setup was initially maintained at 12 hours hrt but due to the flux drop of md membrane hrt increased in an mdbr over time the sludge retention time of an mdbr has kept at 60 days and the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration was kept at 3800 100 at startup for each temperature nitrogen gas was applied in an mdbr before the startup and after membrane cleaning at a flow rate of 1 l min to sustain the anaerobic environment the initial volume of the distillate was taken 1 l in the distillate tank and a volume change was observed after every 24 h the collected distillate water was removed from the distillate tank for each experimental study at four different temperatures a new membrane was used experimental runs were stopped for membrane cleaning when the drop in flux reached about 80 of the initial flux to ensure optimum flux recovery the module was removed from the bioreactor and then by using tap water the membrane was first washed to remove sludge layers and other impurities that had developed on the membrane s surface followed by chemical cleaning for each run except 50 c for organic fouling biofouling 2 wt sodium hypochlorite naocl was used by soaking the membranes in a solution for 15 min followed by 2 wt citric acid solution for inorganic fouling 42 44 2 5 analytical methods the treatment efficiency of the an mdbr setup for each temperature was evaluated by investigating the distillate quality and conductivity in the distillate tank color removal was assessed by hatch method pt co method with a spectrophotometer dr 2400 hach co usa and cod removal by closed reflux method 45 for the sludge characteristics mlss mlvss alkalinity and vfa were determined using standard methods 45 orp and ph were analyzed by ph orp meter hi 83141 hanna instruments ltd uk nitrogen was assessed by ammonia distillation method udk 149 velp scientifica italy while phosphorous in term of orthophosphate was measured by standard method using uv visible spectrophotometer db 20 dynamics 45 biogas was measured with a 1 l capacity biogas collection bag dalian china attached to a bioreactor cation exchange resin method was applied to extract the extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp from the anaerobic sludge showing the concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates 46 to measure the concentration of carbohydrates dubois method utilizing phenol sulfuric acid reagent was used 47 to quantify the concentration of protein lowery method using folin ciocalteu s phenol reagent was used 48 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimizing the wf mf setup wf mf system was optimized to maintain the salinity level in an mdbr due to feeding accumulation same anaerobic condition was maintained in wf mf as in an mdbr synthetic textile wastewater with a conductivity of 10 0 5 ms cm without dyes was used to evaluate the performance in terms of salt removal of the system salt removal from the bioreactor at various fluxes is shown in table 2 fouling of membrane was evaluated using tmp meter for each filtration cycle based on a prior wf mf study five various fluxes 2 5 7 9 and 11 lmh were selected and their tmp profiles were investigated 49 the filtration process was stopped to determine the fouling of the membrane after reaching the tmp at 30 kpa and flux reduction around 70 of the starting flux a previous study also revealed that the wf mf setup was turned off for cleaning purposes after reaching the tmp at 50 kpa and drop in flux around 60 38 to evaluate the wf mf membrane s effectiveness in terms of salt buildup removal and membrane fouling a new membrane was employed for each water flux study by removing the membrane module from the reactor the activity was halted for physical cleaning the membrane was cleaned physically by carefully brushing it under running water the intrinsic membrane resistance rm was measured by performing chemical cleaning just once after each flux to compare the resistance of the virgin membrane 3 2 performance of mesophilic and thermophilic an mdbr processes 3 2 1 effect of feed temperatures on distillate flux and conductivity one of the primary criteria determining md permeation performance is the temperature differential between the distillate side and the membrane feed furthermore increasing the temperature of the reactor may potentially improve the activity of the microorganisms resulting in increased cod removal efficiency however at higher temperatures more organic fouling may occur which would have a negative impact on vapor mass transfer as a result understanding the impacts of reactor temperature on permeate quality and the performance of md is essential this experiment studied the influence of mesophilic 35 and 40 c and thermophilic 45 and 50 c temperatures of the an mdbr for a long period in terms of distillate flux and conductivity using synthetic textile feed increasing the temperature of the reactor has a significant impact on an mdbr flux performance due to the significantly higher vapor pressure created at the membrane surface interface as indicated by fig 2 fig 2 a d reveals that thermophilic temperatures 50 and 45 c exhibited high initial distillate flux of 11 6 0 5 and 9 9 0 5 lmh whereas mesophilic temperatures 40 and 35 c showed the initial fluxes of 7 9 0 3 and 5 9 0 3 lmh respectively ptfe hydrophobic membrane exhibited the average fluxes of about 10 to 14 lmh at a high temperature of approximately 50 to 60 c when using textile wastewater 50 flux was decreased over time in all four experiments as expected which was due to membrane fouling as revealed by other studies 22 an increase in feed temperature of 15 c from 35 to 50 c increased nearly 2 times of the initial flux from 5 9 0 3 to 11 6 0 5 lmh the observed flux decline in the distillate was consistent with earlier findings 22 a sticky cake layer was noticed at the membrane surface active layer at the feed side after the completion of each run the major contributor to the reduction in flux was supposed to be the development of a cake layer fouling on the membrane surface which was comprised of dissolved and suspended organic compounds induced by the results of microbial activities the concentrations of these fouling cake layers were determined in terms of smp and eps carbohydrates protein and detailed results are discussed in section 3 4 furthermore greater flux reductions in the bioreactor might be due to the enhanced production of microbial products associated with elevated temperatures because of increased microbial activity 22 51 fouling layer development obstructs heat transmission to the membrane surface lowering the interfacial temperature of feed as a result a decrease in distillate flux was observed 42 it was also stated that the observed drop in membrane flux was caused by a decrease in the partial pressure of water vapor over the salt solution 28 however rejection of salt in an mdbr at all feed temperatures was sustained at 99 99 for a long duration demonstrating the great removal effectiveness of the membrane technology moreover long duration and a small decrease in flux in an mdbr at 40 c demonstrated that a bioreactor temperature of 40 c was far more suitable practically for long term operation the principal objective of a membrane in an md process is to separate one aqueous stream from another liquid stream permitting volatile components to pass between the two streams failure of the membrane occurs when the liquid feed solution easily penetrates through the membrane a process known as pore wetting wetting reduces salt rejection and hence contaminates the distillate stream the most popular and simplest way for determining wetting is to measure the electrical conductivity of the distillate however the key limitation of this approach is that it determines wetting only once the feed has already fully permeated at least a portion of the membrane pores and polluted the distillate 52 the results show that the conductivity of the distillate increased rapidly after 15 days at 50 c run 25 days at 45 c runs 43 days at 40 c runs and 23 days at 35 c runs indicating the membrane pore wetting and rapid increase in conductivity was observed from 3 5 1 6 to 35 5 Œºs cm as shown in fig 2 a d furthermore a small increase in distillate flux was also observed indicating that membrane wetting occurred as liquid molecules penetrate through the wetted pores and this phenomenon also has been observed in various studies 53 55 membrane wetting is another fouling phenomenon specific to md which mainly relates to the infiltration of contaminated feed water via the pore structure to the distillate side in addition to other methods a decrease in membrane surface hydrophobicity through deposition of surface active substances may result in membrane wetting in comparison with mesophilic temperatures experiments thermophilic temperatures experiments exhibited rapid membrane wetting at 50 c membrane fouling and membrane wetting occurred after 15 days and a similar trend was shown by another study that at elevated temperature the membrane was replaced at a frequency of 20 to 30 days because of wetting and fouling 56 earlier studies have shown that distillate water flux was affected due to md biofouling by enhancing a temperature b concentration polarization and c pore wetting 22 28 54 57 furthermore biofouling was also demonstrated to cause a decrease in water vapor pressure as well as some hydraulic resistance owing to pore blockage and an extra layer of biofilm thus it was suggested that mesophilic temperatures could be used to avoid more biofouling although it has impaired distillate water flux 57 another study confirmed that the degree of membrane wetting was limited at lower feed temperatures which facilitate the system for long term operation 58 flux recovery of md membrane was observed after applying cleaning methods as mentioned in section 2 5 when the distillate flux decreased owing to biofouling and inorganic fouling previous literature also revealed that hybrid aerobic anaerobic md operations may have both types of fouling mechanisms 22 42 as demonstrated in fig 2 a c 35 c has the maximum flux recovery of 84 8 followed by 40 c and 45 c with 78 8 and 75 2 respectively after membrane cleaning results revealed that the maximum flux recovery was obtained at mesophilic temperatures while 45 c has less flux recovery as discussed above due to a large number of wet pores a rapid increase in distillate salinity was reported during biofouling at a thermophilic temperature of 50 c furthermore diffusion rises at higher temperatures since solutes accumulated in the distillate at a faster rate 57 one of the most efficient strategies to prevent wetting is to lower the pore size of the membrane though it is also noted that when the pore size of the membrane was reduced the flux also dropped the pore size of the md membrane must be as narrow as possible to avoid wettability of membrane pores which clashes with the necessity for higher permeability 42 3 3 an mdbr removal efficiency 3 3 1 cod and color removal removal of cod and color from an mdbr at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures were evaluated concurrently after 2 days as indicated by figs 3 and 4 cod concentrations mg l in md distillate influent and supernatant along with cod removal efficiencies of md distillate are summarized in fig 3 the anaerobic environment in an mdbr was well sustained under thermophilic as well as mesophilic temperatures under constant conductivity level of 4 0 5 Œºs cm via wf mf system it was observed that in an anaerobic bioreactor at 35 c temperature the lowest and highest cod removal efficiencies were 39 9 and 56 47 respectively also 40 c temperature demonstrated the minimum and maximum cod removal efficiencies of 43 3 and 58 9 while at 45 c temperature with 47 2 to 62 8 and at 50 c temperature with 51 6 to 68 9 fig 3 depicts cod concentrations in mixed liquor ranging from 940 40 to 1820 40 mg l for varied feed temperatures increased accumulation of cod was detected in mixed liquor at both mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures and this cod accumulation was caused by the high retention mechanism of md membranes fig 3 a d indicates that the rise in cod concentration in mixed liquor differs depending on the mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the maximum reduction in cod removal efficiency from the bioreactor was noticed after the middle of each run and was reduced towards the end more cod accumulation was observed at mesophilic temperatures as compared to thermophilic due to the low degradation rate thus the drop in removal efficiency and higher cod concentrations in mixed liquor towards each run attributed mostly to the production of aromatic amines because of anaerobic degradation of azo dyes which negatively influence the anaerobes as stated previously 59 60 nevertheless the anaerobic process demonstrated impressive cod removal throughout operation with an average removal efficiency in the range of 53 69 compared to prior studies that revealed cod removal efficiencies between 50 and 76 59 61 also fig 3 depicts the removal efficiencies and concentration of cod in md distillate after circulating through the md membrane the removal efficiencies from md distillate were observed in the range of 98 2 99 9 during all four runs moreover concentrations of cod in md distillate ranged between 0 6 0 1 and 20 4 mg l at both mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures indicating a remarkable removal of cod from md membrane in addition a small quantity of cod with a concentration less than 20 4 mg l in md distillate might be due to the volatilization of vfas precious research has found similar cod removal efficiency from md permeate when treating various types of wastewaters 14 22 62 this indicated that integrating biological process and md membrane an mdbr can effectively treat textile wastewater with a high cod concentration of 3000 130 mg l for a long term duration despite the excellent retention mechanism of the md membrane cod rise in the md distillate was noticed at the end of each run this might be due to the pore wetting causing penetration of organic contaminants from feed solution to md distillate as described by previous studies 14 22 42 62 as mentioned earlier due to a large number of wet pores and a decrease in membrane surface hydrophobicity through deposition of surface active substances the sudden increase in distillate conductivity was also observed at end of each run which confirmed that the wetting phenomenon occurred the rapid increase in the permeate ec suggests liquid transfer from the feed into the permeate through wetted membrane pores this was confirmed by the observation of cod and color in the permeate tank at the end of each run the concentration of color pt co in md distillate feed and mixed liquor along with color removal efficiencies of md distillate are summarized in fig 4 it was observed that in an anaerobic bioreactor at 35 c temperature the lowest and highest color removal efficiencies were 43 2 to 55 respectively also 40 c temperature has demonstrated the minimum and maximum color removal efficiencies of 51 3 and 60 9 while at 45 c temperature with 54 1 to 67 4 and at 50 c temperature with 56 2 to 73 6 fig 4 depicts color concentrations in mixed liquor ranging from 280 30 to 530 30 pt co for varied feed temperatures this showed that the textile dyes could be degraded by anaerobic microorganisms if there are no toxic components in a bioreactor like high saline environment due to accumulation of feed which normally inhibits microbial growth the color removal during the biological process owing to the cleavage of the azo bonds found in the textile wastewater resulting in aromatic amines formation 17 other experiments have shown that aromatic amines having functional hydroxyl and carboxyl groups might be mineralized under anaerobic circumstances 63 64 fig 4 a d indicates that the rise in color concentration in mixed liquor differs depending on the mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the maximum color removal efficiency from the bioreactor was noticed in the middle of each run and then reduced towards the end this is because the production of intermediates aromatic amines during the degradation inhibited the anaerobic microbes and lowered their effectiveness as previously explained and described in prior investigations 59 60 furthermore some variation in vfa alkalinity and ph during the continuous process may have a negative effect on color removal performances as discussed previously 65 temperature is a key factor and plays a significant role in the degradation of pollutant kinetics according to 66 the degradation rate is high at elevated temperatures hence higher degradation of dyes was detected more at thermophilic temperatures in comparison with mesophilic temperatures in this study according to another study the temperature of real textile wastewater ranges from 35 to 55 c which corresponds to the current study scenario 67 also fig 4 depicts the removal efficiencies and concentration of color in md distillate the removal efficiencies from md distillate were observed in the range of 98 5 99 9 during all four runs moreover concentrations of color in md distillate ranged between 5 2 and 65 4 mg l at both mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures indicating a remarkable removal of color from md membrane previous research has found similar color removal efficiency from md permeate 9 68 the generation of toxic intermediates during dye degradation for long duration significantly influenced biomass properties although the overall effectiveness of color removal from the an mdbr system remained steady despite the excellent retention mechanism of the md membrane a rise in color concentration in the md distillate was noticed at the end of each run this might be due to the pore wetting causing penetration of liquid molecules from feed solution to md distillate 3 3 2 nutrients removal table 3 shows the variations in nh4 1 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the influent md distillate and removal efficiency at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures the removal efficiency of nh 4 varied between 61 5 and 92 8 demonstrating that the md membrane rejected nh 4 at a lower rate than organic materials 50 62 69 70 this reduced removal efficiency is most likely due to the conversion of nh 4 to nh3 gas owing to its volatility in addition several studies found that the ph of the feed had a substantial influence on the rate of removal efficiency of readily ionized volatile compounds like ammonia also the temperature of the feed had a considerable effect on the rate of removal efficiency of readily ionized volatile compounds 50 ammonium ions tend to shift to volatile ammonia when ph and temperature increase the difference in partial pressure of ammonia gas between feed wastewater and permeate promotes ammonia transfer depending on the ph and temperature of the feed side higher feed temperatures may allow for greater ionization of bicarbonate ions hco3 into carbonate ions co3 2 resulting in a higher feed wastewater ph 71 furthermore raising the temperature of the feed wastewater should help the ammonium ion volatilize into ammonia gas which can readily flow through the hydrophobic membrane ammonium ions are converted more favorably into ammonia gas in the thermophilic bioreactor as compared to mesophilic bioreactors which may readily penetrate through the hydrophobic membrane to minimize the permeation of ammonia the ph of the bioreactor should be adjusted below 7 2 to sustain the retentate 56 in this work the removal efficiency of nh4 1 n was greater in the range of 89 4 to 92 7 at mesophilic temperatures while smaller in the range of 79 4 to 85 7 at thermophilic temperatures the improved efficiency at thermophilic temperatures in this study was due to ph maintained in the range of 6 75 7 25 which is in agreement with another study 71 the concentration of po4 3 p in the permeate water was near zero showing that po4 3 can be rejected completely by the md membrane 69 72 3 4 effect of temperatures on biomass characteristics figs 5 and 6 show the biomass characteristics at the beginning mid and end of all four runs mlvss and mlss are essential criteria in determining the efficacy of biological treatments one of the goals of the study among others was to establish a reactor at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions to observe the effect of temperature increase on sludge characteristics in terms of biomass concentration previous research has also shown that different temperature conditions in the bioreactor have a great influence on the microbial population and biomass suspended solids 22 56 fig 5 a b depicts the concentration of mlvss mlss and ratio of mlvss mlss in an mdbr for all four runs fig 5 a b demonstrated that during mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures concentration of mlss and mlvss increased for mesophilic temperatures mlss increased from 3812 to 3986 mg l and mlvss increased from 2112 to 2210 mg l during 35 c temperature with mlvss mlss ratio of 0 55 to 0 58 during 40 c temperature mlss increased from 3840 to 4235 mg l and mlvss increased from 2150 to 2413 mg l with mlvss mlss ratio of 0 56 to 0 59 similarly for thermophilic temperatures mlss increased from 3895 to 4442 mg l and mlvss increased from 2155 to 2810 mg l during 45 c temperature with mlvss mlss ratio of 0 56 to 0 63 during 50 c temperature mlss increased from 3990 to 4670 mg l and mlvss increased from 2335 to 3040 mg l with mlvss mlss ratio of 0 58 to 0 65 the concentrations of mlss and mlvss at thermophilic temperatures revealed that biomass growth was not much affected by intermediates during dye degradation due to the high degradation rate the small reduction in the mlvss mlss ratio for a mesophilic temperature at 35 c indicates that the formation of hazardous intermediates due to degradation of dyes for a long duration harmed the biomass in the bioreactor in earlier investigations an ideal mlvss mlss ratio of 0 45 to 0 65 was shown to be acceptable for anaerobic processes 65 73 organic foulants such as eps and smp are the most prominent substances responsible for membrane biofouling 56 62 74 biofouling is also caused by the accumulation and adsorption of eps and smp on the surface of the membrane and inside pores 21 protein and carbohydrates are the most prevalent components detected in both the eps and smp out of nucleic acids humic acid protein carbohydrates and lipids 75 in the bioreactor the sum of protein and carbohydrate concentrations was used to express eps and smp eps and smp concentrations in terms of carbohydrates and protein are shown in fig 6 a b for all four runs fig 6 a depicts eps concertation in the bioreactor for all four runs both at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures with time the eps at thermophilic temperatures both in terms of carbohydrate and protein concentrations significantly decreased while substantial amounts of eps were observed at mesophilic temperatures thus temperature increase reduces the microorganism s capacity to produce eps resulting in the death of active bacteria and the development of biodegradable debris these cell lysis and cell debris production results in the conversion of eps bound to eps soluble or smp 76 77 moreover fouling of membrane in thermophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor was significantly worse compared to mesophilic system ding et al 78 demonstrated that the temperature plays a significant role indicating that protein to carbohydrate ratio p c and eps release was higher at thermophilic temperatures resulting in 5 to 10 times greater filtration resistance than the mesophilic temperatures at thermophilic temperatures eps decreased from 181 9 mg gvss 45 c run to 141 9 mg gvss 50 c run while at mesophilic temperatures eps increased from 205 2 mg gvss 40 c run to 239 53 mg gvss 35 c run the carbohydrate and protein concentrations of smp in the bioreactor increased with an increase in temperature as shown in fig 6 b therefore the increase in smp in the bioreactor was mainly due to the thermophilic temperature of an mdbr thermophilic temperatures exhibit more smp as compared to mesophilic temperatures due to the high degradation of organic compounds and cell lysis 28 70 at mesophilic temperatures smp increased from 60 4 mg l 35 c run to 84 3 mg l 40 c run while at thermophilic temperatures smp increased from 120 5 mg l 45 c run to 144 6 mg l 50 c run previous research has found that increasing temperature in the reactor resulted in higher proportions of smp in the supernatant 62 77 several investigations have also shown that smp is a major source of membrane fouling in terms of pore blocking 79 according to one study 80 both eps extracted from cake layer sludge soluble eps or smp and eps extracted from bulk sludge loosely bond extra polymeric substances lb eps induced the greatest flux decline whereas another study 21 explained that cake layer noticed on the surface of the membrane in anaerobic operation has lower removability than cake layer found in aerobic processes similarly this study revealed that the increase in smp was most noticeable at higher temperatures as discussed earlier hence a maximum flux drop was observed from the 45 c runs this might indicate that the buildup of more smp in the supernatant led to worse pore blocking and cake layer development with greater flux decrease 78 79 3 5 biogas production and anaerobic stability characteristics the successful biogas production at both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions using an mdbr may perhaps contribute to energy improved efficient system the temperature has a significant impact on biogas generation as demonstrated by results fig 7 a depicts the findings of volumetric biogas generation in ml l day at each temperature among four temperatures the maximum biogas generation volume of 64 5 ml l day was attained at 50 c for 17 days operation while the least biogas volume of 45 1 ml l day was generated at 35 c for 27 days which can be due to the improved activity of microbial community at higher temperature resulting in rapid organic degradation and these results correlate with a previous study 22 40 c temperatures showed stable biogas production between 34 5 and 49 8 ml l day for a long duration as the rate of feed cod was proportional to the rate of md distillate flux therefore olr was high at elevated temperature than the lower one in an mdbr which indicated that the daily feed consumption organic loading rate was highly associated with the daily biogas volume 22 for long term operation the gas generation efficiency at 50 c deteriorated because of rapid decline in flux and olr the biogas yield in ml g cod removed was relatively stable throughout the operation regardless of the an mdbr temperatures as shown in fig 7 b furthermore the anaerobic behavior for biogas generation is mostly determined by the stability characteristics including ph orp and vfa alkalinity as shown in table 4 by offering appropriate conditions for the anaerobic microbial community stability characteristics play an important role in the production of biogas and the smooth running of an mdbr the results showed that throughout the experiments at all temperatures ph of the an mdbr was maintained between 6 72 and 7 28 and orp between 339 and 394 mv indicating a suitable anaerobic environment previous research has shown that by keeping orp and ph at specified values an optimal condition in the bioreactor was observed 39 65 furthermore a reduction in ph has been observed because of increased vfas buildup throughout the anaerobic phase to keep the ph of the reactor between 6 7 and 7 3 some alkalinity in the form of sodium bicarbonate nahco3 was added to the recipe at higher feed temperatures md membrane rejects alkaline salt which allows for greater ionization of bicarbonate ions hco3 into carbonate ions co3 2 resulting in a ph buffer in an mdbr 69 the overall alkalinity and vfa in an mdbr during all experimental runs were between 1570 55 mg l and 660 45 mg l having a vfa alkalinity ratio of 0 35 0 04 as shown in table 4 which indicates the improved performance of anaerobic bioreactor previous research has shown that vfa less than 1000 mg l and alkalinity more than 1000 mg l are best suited for anaerobic treatment 61 65 in prior research it was also discovered that the vfa alkalinity ratio was maintained in the range of 0 3 to 0 4 39 during each of the four experimental runs the concentration of vfa in the bioreactor decreased while the concentration of alkalinity increased this drop in vfa concentration is caused by the conversion of acetogenic microorganisms to methanogenic ones it was also concluded from previous research that a continued reduction in vfa was observed due to the formation of methanogenic microbes 39 4 conclusions in this study the performance of lab scale an mdbr system treating high strength synthetic textile wastewater at mesophilic 35 and 40 c and thermophilic 45 and 50 c temperatures was investigated the an mdbr process attained 99 99 inorganic salt rejection irrespective of the operating temperatures and high initial flux between 5 9 and 11 5 l m2 h lmh at 35 50 c overall an mdbr performance was in the range of 99 0 9 for cod and color removal among the four temperatures 40 c exhibited the optimum performance for 47 days with steady biogas production the removal efficiency of nh4 1 n was greater in the range of 89 4 to 92 7 at mesophilic temperatures while smaller in the range of 79 4 to 85 7 at thermophilic temperatures by maintaining ph between 6 75 and 7 25 the concentration of po4 3 p in the permeate water was near zero showing that po4 3 can be rejected completely by the md membrane due to membrane biofouling and scaling wetting was observed for different durations at different temperatures in an mdbr conductivity was maintained at 4 0 5 ms cm by integrating wf mf showing the effectiveness of wf mf in mitigating salinity buildup in bioreactor and enhancement of stable flux in an mdbr the distillate water from the an mdbr unit can be reused for a variety of purposes such as industrial processes and irrigation based on obtained results an mdbr is recommended as comparatively reliable technology producing high quality distillate and economic
