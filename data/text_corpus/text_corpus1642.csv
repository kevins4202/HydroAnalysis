8210,study region canada study focus given the effects of climate change on extreme precipitation updated intensity duration frequency idf relationships have been adopted across canada since the idfs generation is based on the assumption of stationarity the rainfall statistics information may be unreliable recent research is attempting to develop a new methodology to integrate non stationarity and climate change into idfs updating process up to now there is no comprehensive evaluation of the idfs updating procedure at different locations in this study we analyzed the combined effect of non stationarity and climate change on future idfs at six selected gauging stations across canada new hydrological insights for the region a comparison of the updated future idfs with historical idfs indicates an intensification of extreme events for all study areas increasing hazard to them sites located in the northeast coastal region will be the most affected in the future by the extreme precipitation in addition there is a clear indication that rare events 100 year return period will become more frequent in some cases increase up to 443 of the water infrastructure risk of failure has been observed we argue that the above findings i offer a new overview of future extreme precipitation across canada and ii should be considered by the stakeholders with respect to climate change adaptation decisions keywords extreme precipitation non stationarity climate change idf curves canada 1 introduction intensity duration frequency idf curves are the primary instrument used in hydrologic designs and stormwater risk management since they provide the characteristics of rainfall extremes agilan and umamahesh 2015 thiombiano et al 2017 idf curves are usually developed by fitting annual maximum precipitation amps series to a theoretical probability distribution under the assumption of stationarity i e the frequency of extreme precipitation events is not expected to change over time significantly however under a changing climate stationary assumption may not be valid anymore tan and gan 2016 impacting water infrastructure design and management and resulting in the rise of the associated risk of failure and reduction of the system s capacity to provide a required level of service mailhot and duchesne 2009 mailhot et al 2011 cheng et al 2014 salas and obeyesekera 2014 for example canada is experiencing a high level of damages caused by extreme precipitation according to catastrophe indices and quantification inc all the top 10 highest loss years on record have occurred in the last 22 years insurance bureau of canada 2020 in previous studies some attention has been given to non stationarity in extreme rainfall statistics using the extreme value theory evt with climate variability and change as an object of investigation for reviewing and updating idfs cheng et al 2014 yilmaz and pereira 2014 yousef and ouarda 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 regarding idf relationships specifically the studies usually focus on modelling a trend function in the location and scale parameters of the evt distribution modelling trend functions involves the introduction of one or more covariates for example cheng et al 2014 developed idf curves by assuming a linear trend in generalized extreme value gev location parameter using time as a covariate yilmaz and pereira 2014 and ganguli and coulibaly 2017 considered a similar trend function of time for location and scale parameters of gev further given the limitations related to the use of time as a covariate agilan and umamahesh 2017 ouarda et al 2018 and ouarda et al 2020 evaluated different physical processes and climate indices in addition to time to develop non stationary idf curves the use of non stationary idfs in the present period to project future rainfall extremes may not be reliable given the multiple processes that control the occurrence and intensity of precipitation especially under changing climate conditions in summary trends associated with extreme precipitation in the future may not be similar to those presented in the historical observations climate models can simulate the complex nature of the climate system and provide credible information about future climate allowing extreme value analysis and idf update much of the recent literature is focused on the improvements in reducing uncertainties involved in generating idf curves such as the spatial resolution of climate models choice of ipcc emission scenarios and selection of a downscaling approach rupa et al 2015 maraun 2016 fadhel et al 2017 cook et al 2020 however due to the complexity of considering multiple climate information choices and the limited availability of climate expertise among water practitioners there is a high level of difficulty in implementing updated idf curves in practice sandink et al 2016 simonovic et al 2016 limiting the implementation of measures for climate change adaptation today there are various approaches available for updating idf curves under future climate conditions this work builds on the publicly accessible web based tool for updating idfs known as idf cc simonovic et al 2016 developed by the western university and the institute for catastrophic loss reduction the tool covers canada and offers updated idfs at gauged and ungauged locations it has been in use since february 2015 and is currently in version 4 5 schardong et al 2020 over 3 360 registered and active users are currently using the tool as of march 25 2021 access to the idf cc tool is available at http www idf cc uwo ca idf cc adopts an original equidistance quantile matching eqm method for updating idf curves developed by srivastav et al 2014 eqm uses a two step procedure to capture the distribution changes between the projected time period and the baseline period and downscaling the amp derived from the gcm data and the observed sub daily data since its initial version the idf cc tool has been gradually improved with new functionalities and data the current version of the tool schardong et al 2020 i uses gev distribution ii uses a modified quantile matching qm algorithm for updating idf curves using the gev distribution iii provides updating of idf curves for ungauged location iv keeps the local database up to date and v includes the most current climate models the idf cc tool has been designed and implemented in response to the increased demand for incorporating climate change into the generation of future rainfall information across canada other approaches for updating future idfs have been reported in canada three of them including the idf cc use parametric probability distributions to quantify extreme rainfall quantiles nguyen et al 2007 hassanzadeh et al 2014 ganguli and coulibaly 2019 their advantage against other methods is a reduction in error propagation for projecting idf curves under future conditions they focus on specific rainfall quantiles rather than the entire time series hassanzadeh et al 2019 for example nguyen et al 2007 developed the scale invariance method sim which derives the distribution of short duration local amps based on daily amps using the scaling relationships between non central moments over different rainfall durations the authors applied their study to 15 rain gauge stations over quebec in the city of saskatoon hassanzadeh et al 2014 used genetic programming to extract the quantile quantile relationship between the amps at the gcm and local scales during a baseline period and update idf curves using predictions obtained from gcms although these methodologies present opportunities to develop future idf curves they are all limited by the stationarity assumption in future amps modelling which may underestimate overestimate the property of rainfall extremes ganguli and coulibaly 2019 used the equiratio quantile mapping wang and chen 2013 to generate future sub daily amps and then updated idf curves using a non stationary model based on the bayesian inference limited to southern ontario canada all published studies revealed a rise in magnitude and frequency in future rainfall intensities compared to the current period which can be even more intense in the presence of positive trends in extreme precipitation given the course of climate change however the studies ignore the non stationarity that may be present already in the historical period recently silva et al 2021 have revised the eqm method used by the idf cc tool to include possible non stationary behaviour into the future idfs generation first unlike the straightforward application of non stationarity in distribution modelling this new framework is based on statistical analysis which identifies if the non stationary model is the best model to be fitted to data second the method can use non stationary information in the historical period and translate it into the future also canada has experienced severe precipitation events over the years and across the country these events encouraged evaluating the climate change impacts on idf curves by applying eqmns over six selected gauging stations across canada the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the methodology used in this work section 3 presents the study area and data used conducted analyses are explained in section 4 and the discussion of the results is presented in section 5 section 6 summarizes the concluding remarks 2 methodology 2 1 study region this study is conducted using six selected rainfall gauging stations located across canada calgary alberta hamilton ontario london ontario moncton new brunswick vancouver british columbia and winnipeg manitoba as shown in fig 1 the station selection criteria included i representation of different climatic zones of canada and ii data availability more than 50 years the following zones were included through the selection of the rainfall gauging stations great lakes represented by hamilton and london gauging stations where summer precipitation is from convective showers and thunderstorms and fall precipitation characterized by reduced convective activity and increased lake effect precipitation lapen and hayhoe 2003 coastal regions being represented by vancouver station pacific coast and moncton station atlantic coast vancouver climatic variability is induced by ocean atmosphere coupling and annual precipitation modulated by el niño southern oscillation and the pacific decadal oscillation later being associated with high intensity rainfall events jacob et al 2003 western continental air masses influence moncton climate and the presence of the ocean modifies it prairies are represented by winnipeg station and with a flat topography the region is characterized by the exposure to high pressure climate systems the mountainous region represented by calgary gauging station located near the canadian rockies with extreme rainfall being affected by the orographic effects 2 2 observed and simulated data used observed maximum annual rainfall series were extracted from the six selected stations for the following sub daily durations 5 10 15 30 60 120 360 720 and 1440 minutes data is provided from the environmental and climate change canada https climate weather gc ca prods servs engineering e html last accessed july 2021 table 1 shows details of the selected gauging stations used in this study data quality control was conducted initially to remove the missing years and organize the dataset for implementing the block maxima approach in data fitting the extent of missing data in the sub daily amp series ranges between 4 6 and 22 with the least being in vancouver 2002 2003 2017 and the highest in winnipeg 1950 1955 1957 1997 2006 respectively the main impact of missing values in frequency analysis is making the quantile estimates less accurate benestad 2004 in non stationary modelling missing values can underestimate the power of the trend function although there is a presence of missing data in the time series being used all the stations include a minimum of 50 years available which is acceptable for frequency analysis zhu et al 2016 precipitation simulated data was derived from 24 gcms produced for coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 from different climate research centers ipcc 2014 table s1 see supplementary material these data are bias corrected and statistically downscaled using the bias correction constructed analogues with quantile version 2 mapping reordering bccaqv2 for canada at a gridded resolution of 10 km x 10 km for the simulated period of 1950 2100 schardong et al 2020 bccaqv2 is a hybrid method composed of bias correction constructed analogues which is used to rescale projections to match observations at the same time quantile mapping is employed to preserve the gcm trends in the downscaling daily data gudmundsson et al 2012 in summary bccaqv2 corrects the bias in daily precipitation series obtained from climate models so the distribution properties are close to historical maurer et al 2010 the models were selected based on the availability of projections for three different emissions scenarios rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 data is provided by the pacific climate impacts consortium pcic https data pacificclimate org portal downscaled gcms map last accessed august 03 2020 2 3 eqmns method in this paper we applied the eqmns method to bias correct projected amps and further assess the impacts of climate change on the intensity duration and frequency of extreme rainfall events through the updated non stationary idf curves eqmns was first proposed by silva and simonovic 2020 and silva et al 2021 as a recent improvement to the eqm method srivastav et al 2014 schardong et al 2018 2020 used with the idf cc tool eqmns can consider the possible effects of non stationarity on updating idf curves under a changing climate by including statistical analysis the proposed and implemented methodology s main steps are presented below fig 2 the eqmns method combines three main steps to generate non stationary idf curves under a changing climate i statistical modelling and analysis which model data by fitting a theoretical distribution function and assess the non stationarity of the observed historical period ii bias correction method for deriving information in the projected period and iii statistical modelling and analysis which model data by fitting a theoretical distribution function and assess the non stationarity in the projected period first statistical modelling and analysis is applied to the amps dataset we fitted an independent cumulative distribution function cdf to each sub daily amp time series this study used the generalized extreme value gev distribution which is characterized by three parameters location scale and shape for introducing non stationary behaviour in the modeling parameters distribution of observed historical data time is used as a covariate the parameters of gev are allowed to vary as a function of time nine different settings of the gev parameters one stationary and eight non stationary are considered see appendix a for the detailed list the choices include trend functions e g linear polynomial or exponential for the location and scale parameters previously applied to frequency based analyses e g el adlouni et al 2007 ouarda et al 2018 ragno et al 2018 the parameter estimation for the gev distribution is carried out using the maximum likelihood method based on eqmns it is argued that non stationary modelling needs to be considered given its potential improvements compared to the stationary model for assessing the best gev model the corrected akaike information criteria aicc is implemented to compare nine candidate models in the case of the best gev model being non stationary the likelihood ratio lr test is used to assess its statistical significance against the stationary model the use of two assessment methods was based on the complexity of the gev models adopted and the findings of kim et al 2017 in comparing model selection methods the statistical significance for nonstationary modeling is assessed at 5 significance level i e p value 0 05 in this paper we also analyzed the quality of the fitted model a goodness of fit measure commonly assesses the quality of the theoretical distribution e g kolmogorov smirnov test chi squared test probability probability plot quantile quantile plot agilan and umamahesh 2017 sugahara et al 2009 however for the sake of brevity in this paper we calculated the coefficient of determination r q q 2 associated with the quantile plot as a goodness of fit measure once the best model is identified as stationary the equidistance quantile matching eqm schardong et al 2018 method is applied in two steps i quantile based mapping to establish a statistical relationship between the gcm data and the observed sub daily precipitation spatial downscaling and ii quantile delta mapping between model baseline and projected periods to preserve the relative changes in quantiles temporal downscaling however in the case of the best gev model being non stationary the varying parameters will change with time thus a modified spatial downscaling is performed by introducing the 95th percentile of the parameter values in historical observation the modification in spatial downscaling allows translation of the non stationary information from the observed period to the projected period these downscaling procedures integrate theoretical distribution modelling information and generate sub daily amps in the projected period the final stage of eqmns refers to statistical modelling and analysis applied to future amps therefore a similar procedure to the one used at the first step is conducted to fit different gev models list provided in appendix a and assess the best gev model based on aicc and lr tests finally if the best gev model is identified as stationary the future idf curve is generated by adopting the constant set of parameters otherwise given that the best gev model is identified as non stationary the calculated 95th percentile of the varying parameters are used to estimate the future idf relationships the same values can be found with the calculated 95th percentile of future idfs changing over time a detailed mathematical description of the eqmns method can be found in silva et al 2021 2 4 numerical analyses the idf updating process under non stationary conditions implemented for all six stations includes the following steps 1 extracting of three amps datasets i the sub daily maximums from the six gauging stations i e maximums of 5 10 15 30 minutes and 1 2 6 12 24 hours precipitation data for calgary hamilton london moncton vancouver and winnipeg stations ii daily maximums for the baseline period indicated by the available years in table 1 for each location from the selected gcm models listed in table 1 and iii daily maximums for the period of 2020 2100 from the selected gcm models and the three rcp scenarios i e rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 all three datasets should be in chronological order 2 fitting the gev cumulative distribution to each observed sub daily time series based on the nine sets of parameters shown in appendix a using the maximum likelihood method 3 selecting the best gev model for each observed sub daily time series using the corrected akaike information criteria 4 in the case of the best choice being a non stationary gev model assess its statistical significance against the stationary gev model using the likelihood test at the 5 significance level 5 once the statistical significance of the non stationary gev model is checked extract the fit parameters by computing the 95th percentiles for the varying parameters otherwise extract the fit parameters of the stationary gev model 6 fitting the gev cumulative distribution to two daily amps series obtained from the gcm models i e the baseline and the projected periods based on the setting stationary gev i and using the maximum likelihood method 7 establishing a statistical relationship between the daily gcm for the baseline period and the observed sub daily series for the best gev model using the principle of quantile mapping this is the bias correction applied to data in the historical period 1 x j o h f j o h 1 f m h x m h where x is the amp for a given station and x is the bias corrected amp quantiles at the station scale for each sub daily j observed rainfall o in historical period h f is the cumulative distribution of probability and f 1 is its inverse m refers to the modelled amp data 8 developing a functional relationship between the quantiles extracted from step 7 and the daily amps gcm data for the baseline period as suggested by hassanzadeh et al 2014 the following function is used in this study 2 x j o h a j x m h b j c j x m h d j x m h where a j b j c j and d j are the adjusted coefficients of the eq 1 for each sub daily duration j a differential evolution optimization algorithm is used to find the adjusted coefficients 9 development of the statistical relationship between the daily amps gcm data for the baseline period and the daily amps gcm data for the projected period for each rcp scenario using quantile mapping 10 determining the relative change between the projected period and the historical baseline period by dividing the daily amps gcm data for the projected period by the quantiles extracted in step 9 11 calculating future sub daily time series by replacing x m h with the quantiles extracted in step 9 in eq 2 and multiplying them by the relative change calculated in step 10 12 repeating the steps 2 3 4 and 5 for each future sub daily time series to model gev distribution under stationary and non stationary conditions assess which model fits the data the best and then extracting the fit parameters 13 calculating the future idf curves using the inverse distribution function for 5 25 and 100 year return periods and comparing them with the historically observed idf curves to assess the impact of climate change on the extreme precipitation intensities 2 5 assessment of gcm models performance evaluating the impact of climate change on future rainfall extremes involves the use of climate models there are numerous climate models from the cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 https pcmdi llnl gov mips cmip5 last accessed january 25 2021 which projections are available for this purpose cmip6 models data are slowly becoming available https pcmdi llnl gov cmip6 last accessed january 25 2021 this study is using climate models from cmip5 however the outputs from different models are different and using an individual model may bring uncertainty about the future song et al 2020 therefore evaluating the performance of the climate models is an important task given the large number of cmip5 gcm models used in this study we assessed their performance relative to observations specifically in reproducing the characteristics of extreme events we used the skill score defined by taylor 2001 to evaluate the performance of gcm outputs after bias correction eq 1 taylor 2001 this score provides the information about the relative accuracy among several models and is based on the correlation coefficient and variance between modelled and observed data 3 s 4 1 r σ ˆ m 1 σ ˆ m 2 1 r 0 where s is the skill score and vary from 0 least skillful and 1 most skillful r is the correlation coefficient between gcm and observed datasets r0 is the maximum correlation coefficient attainable here r0 is 1 and σ ˆ m is the relation between the standard deviation of the gcm model data and the standard deviation of observed data 3 results this section presents the results obtained from the assessment of future idf curves for the selected six sites across canada we used the proposed eqm see schardong et al 2018 for more details and eqmns silva and simonovic 2020 silva et al 2021 methods with gev distribution to fit the probability of maximum annual precipitation and generate the future idf curves under climate change with stationary and non stationary behaviour respectively the analyses are conducted under three rcp scenarios i e rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future idfs were generated for the 2020 2100 projected period analyses were provided based on the historical and future idfs relationships the investigations carried out in this paper were aimed at answering the following four questions 1 are the historical idfs at selected locations misrepresenting the real conditions of extreme precipitation 2 is the estimated future extreme rainfall sensitive to the choice of climate model emission scenario and the frequency analysis i e stationary and non stationary conditions 3 how much rainfall intensities are expected to change in the future due to climate change 4 how will the expected changes in extreme rainfall affect the hydrologic probability of exceedance in canada precipitation design criteria differ from province to province since the selected locations are in different provinces the results were evaluated based on the probability of exceedance or return period often used in municipal drainage practices and flood risk management given by 5 year 25 year and 100 year return periods 3 1 analyses of the historical data in the context of climate change the planning of the future often builds on the understanding of the present since the use of climate projections for future idf curves integrates information from the present time in this section we briefly present the extreme precipitation statistics obtained by using historical observations the results of the analysis with recorded sub daily amps at selected sites are given in table 2 together with the best gev based model identified by statistical tests the coefficient of determination r q q 2 associated with the plot of modelled and empirical quantiles are presented in table s2 as an assessment of the accuracy of the adopted model there is no clear spatial pattern of trend in precipitation among the considered regions of canada only the moncton station shows a significant non stationary behaviour in gev modelling over most of the durations no change pattern i e trend detection is confirmed for all durations at two sites under the influence of great lakes london and hamilton the same findings were observed by ganguli and coulibaly 2019 for hamilton and london stations for 60 min and 1440 min durations however they have used a different data period and another statistical test to detect monotonic trends mann kendall test the non stationary model was the best gev model for vancouver and winnipeg stations for only one duration 360 min and 1440 min respectively non stationary behaviour for the calgary station was noted for 10 min and 720 min durations for daily precipitation our results are consistent with previous studies e g tan and gan 2016 tan et al 2017 these findings suggest that there is a general misrepresentation of the idf relationships for the moncton station given the presence of non stationary behaviour for almost all the rainfall durations for 1440 min precipitation our results are consistent with previous studies e g tan and gan 2016 tan et al 2017 these findings suggest that there is a general misrepresentation of the idf relationships for the moncton station given the presence of non stationary behaviour for different rainfall durations especially those longer than 1 h 3 2 performance of gcm models in this section we present the performance of the 24 bias corrected gcm models in addition to their median ensemble med ensemble i e the median of amp from all the gcm models in reproducing the extreme quantiles in the baseline period using taylor s skill scores fig 3 presents heat maps for assessing the skill scores for different durations using rcp 8 5 climate projections figs s1 and s2 are available in the supplementary material for other rcps note that we used abbreviated station names cal is calgary hal is hamilton lon is london mon is moncton van is vancouver and win is winnipeg the models overall skill score was higher than 0 30 which is considered an average score variations in the skill scores are more significant among locations than among the models among durations the variability is higher for small durations in this paper we used models with different spatial resolutions the performance evaluation of the models in characterizing the extreme events for different durations shows that the worst skill scores are not related to low resolution models however most of the models with finer spatial resolution have an excellent performance compared to the others for example the ccsm4 model has a better agreement higher skill score for vancouver than for hamilton while the performance of mri cgcm3 shows the opposite results otherwise both models show similar spatial performance compared to a single model the performance of the median ensemble models is often lower nevertheless med ensemble shows moderate to good performance for all the locations with a skill score ranging from 0 35 for rcp2 6 to 0 67 for rcp8 5 3 3 analyses of updated idf curves for future conditions in this section two types of results are presented i comparison between stationary and non stationary idf curves for future conditions and ii comparison of idf curves for different locations across canada in order to evaluate how sensitive is the future extreme precipitation to the choice of different climate models and the frequency analysis approach i e stationary or non stationary boxplots of rainfall depths for 5 25 and 100 year return periods are presented in figs 4 6 for rcp 8 5 results for other rcps are available in figs s3 s8 in the supplementary material boxplots are able to capture the variations and the uncertainty in generated idfs using different climate models the boxplots show the interquartile range iqr defined as the range between the lower and upper quartiles defined as the 25th and 75th percentile of rainfall depths for the 24 climate models used in general the values estimated for precipitation under stationary conditions underestimate those values estimated under non stationary conditions also there is a larger iqr for non stationary behaviour when compared to a stationary behaviour these results illustrate how much future rainfall can vary between models and how non stationary modelling can enlarge these variations previous studies have pointed that the non stationary models given their complexity lead to more uncertainty than the stationary models ouarda et al 2020 for example for vancouver station the 360 min 25 year event iqrs produced under stationary conditions for rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are 5 26 mm 4 92 mm and 8 63 mm respectively while iqrs produced for non stationary conditions for the same scenarios are 10 14 mm 5 78 mm 12 01 mm respectively the use of different climate models is another source of uncertainty as discussed in cook et al 2020 therefore given the good performance of the median ensemble presented in section 3 2 we used it to estimate the rainfall intensities for future climate conditions table 3 for rcp 8 5 and tables s3 and s4 for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 respectively in the case of short durations e g 60 min great lakes and prairies are the climatic regions that will experience the highest rainfall intensity by the end of the century these findings are presented for both stationarity and non stationarity conditions for events longer than 60 min there is no regular spatial pattern for different return periods results in table 3 and tables s3 and s4 indicate that for all locations rainfall intensities under stationary assumption are below the rainfall intensities under non stationary behaviour since we only considered non stationarity after checking its statistical significance against the stationary conditions these results suggest a positive trend associated with future extreme rainfall rcp 8 5 is the most critical emission scenario and non stationarity is more significant for all locations the positive trend is most visible for the moncton station given the difference between precipitation depths for stationary and non stationary conditions for all durations and return periods in fact both coastal locations moncton and vancouver and mountainous location calgary show that these climatic regions are the most affected by non stationarity in idf curves in other words these regions will experience a higher positive trend in extreme precipitation in future when compared to other regions for mountainous and coastal locations the effect of non stationarity is expressive for lower return periods e g 5 year in moncton for rcp 8 5 the 1440 min 100 year return period event increased about 2 7 mm h 1 by using the non stationarity approach compared to 0 7 mm h 1 for stationary in vancouver for the 360 min 25 year return period event this difference reaches 0 8 mm h 1 for rcp 4 5 the climate regions like great lakes represented by london and hamilton locations and prairies represented by winnipeg are the less affected regions by considering non stationarity in future idf curves for hamilton station non stationarity has only affected results under rcp 8 5 for london the future non stationary idf relationships increased up to 7 and 26 for the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 respectively compared to the future stationary idf relationships for winnipeg the 360 min 25 year return period event the increase is only 1 1 mm h 1 when the non stationarity is considered in the development of idfs 3 4 comparison between current and idf curves for future conditions the summary of the change in the idf curves obtained using both stationary and non stationary assumptions for the selected stations and rcp 8 5 emission scenario is presented using the heat maps in fig 7 figs s9 and s10 for rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios respectively the results are presented using the med ensemble the relative change in the rainfall intensity by the end of the century versus the historical period is calculated as follows 4 r e l a t i v e c h a n g e 100 z t f z t h z t h where relative change is given as the percent of change of rainfall intensity in the future when compared to the rainfall intensity in the present period z t f is the rainfall intensity in the future period and z t h is the rainfall intensity in the historical period the results indicate an increase related to the observed period for all locations durations and rcps which suggest that extreme events are expected to be intensified in the future relative changes show the direct effect of non stationarity on the magnitude of future extreme precipitation comparison to the stationary conditions and give further details among return periods and climatic zones these results have a practical value for the hydrologists since they represent the so called safety factor and can be used to adjust current design values ragno et al 2018 the results do not reveal a pattern of change among the three considered rcps and the increase in precipitation does not follow the severity of the emission scenario in fact for the rcp 4 5 the relative change is often lower than for the other scenarios the nature of the climate models simulated data and the assessed trend support these findings for example the relative change of estimated precipitation for calgary is smaller for rcp 4 5 than rcp 2 6 these observations occur for both stationary and non stationary cases despite the different magnitudes some information about changes across different climate zones in canada can be also extracted from the presented results as shown in fig 7 for locations near oceans the precipitation is expected to increase more than for continental areas in general moncton located at the east atlantic coast of canada shows the most significant increase in extreme precipitation on the other side vancouver results suggest a similar behaviour at the pacific coast in the great lakes hamilton and london show a similar increase in the stationary case on the other hand the london location shows a higher increase than hamilton for the non stationary case indicating that the effects of non stationarity intensify the extreme precipitation in london a previous study applied to stations in southern ontario has revealed different patterns between locations ganguli and coulibaly 2019 for the rcp2 6 for example the stations located close to the great lakes show a negative relative change suggesting that precipitation will be reduced under this scenario in the future for the stations located in prairie and mountainous regions non stationarity is significant only for the rcp 8 5 3 5 the main implications results generated through the presented research are confirming that one of the main consequences of climate change is an increase in extreme precipitation in addition adopting a non stationary assumption results in further intensification of the magnitude and frequency of these impacts in urban environments these changes directly affect the performance level of urban infrastructure systems pointing to the necessity for better risk communication of hazardous climatic conditions as suggested by ragno et al 2018 in this study we evaluated the expected future return period of events which based on 120 min and 1440 min historical observations have a return period of 5 and 100 years respectively these specific events are selected based on their practical use in infrastructure design and management in canada simonovic et al 2017 and may help to improve the understanding of future climate change impacts on the frequency of extreme precipitation events table 4 provides the observed rainfall intensity for all selected locations observed rainfall intensity was estimated using a stationary gev model table 5 shows the return period expected in the future under the rcp 8 5 scenario tables s5 and s6 present the results for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 respectively for moncton location for example events expected to occur every year with the probability of 1 5 will become more frequent and are expected to occur every year with the probability of 1 1 4 similarly 100 year events for the winnipeg location will become about 18 year events these results indicate an increase of about 257 and 443 of projected precipitation hazards in the future respectively warning of potentially severe impacts on society and infrastructure safety this particular concern seems to be outstanding in moncton city in which extreme precipitation is expected to substantially increase in magnitude as shown in the previous section and frequency also the coastal area of the province of new brunswick where moncton is located is sensitive to sea level rise and associated storm impacts not considered in these research analyses braden and simonovic 2020 hydrological risk is quite similar for vancouver which arises an emergent warning for the coastal areas in the case of winnipeg for high frequency events the reduction of return periods is very low while low frequency events will be subject to very significant change future hazards are also quite different for london and hamilton for high return periods despite their spatial closeness the hydrological risk in london will be higher in the future given the effects of non stationarity presented in future precipitation 4 conclusions in this study we have applied a non stationary framework in order to update idf curves for future climate conditions to detect the non stationarity of amps series the time year is used as a covariate to estimate the parameters of the non stationary distribution this procedure was implemented for nine durations of precipitation at six different gauging stations across canada classified as a climate zone there is no clear pattern of non stationary behaviour among durations and climate change projections variation of trends is observed from station to station given the differences between local characteristics and climate future idfs are updated adopting stationary and non stationary approaches and using 24 gcm models under three rcp scenarios 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 the results emphasize the sensitivity of idfs to the choice of a climate model in addition others source of uncertainties includes i the non stationarity presented in the observed period and ii the non stationarity presented in the projected period given a large number of conducted experiments with each of 24 gcm models different results are shown for the gcm ensemble intense precipitation will increase for most locations durations and return periods consideration of non stationary behaviour is making this increase even more expressive as we considered a 95 confidence level for non stationarity detection these insights indicate the need for revisiting water infrastructure design and management practice in canada among climatic zones our findings point to a high hazard for sites located at the atlantic coast i e moncton location with a trend in extreme historical precipitation for this specific location an increase of extreme precipitation is expected in a greater proportion than for the other locations in the future coastal areas are exposed to the compounding risks associated with the impacts of the ocean cities near the water bodies may experience a higher magnitude of change between current and future conditions interestingly we found that inland areas will experience a lower increase in precipitation intensity however given the local rainfall patterns the projected future hazard may increase significantly as indicated for the locations in the canadian prairies several climate indices have been associated with variability and extreme precipitation across canada they include arctic oscillation pacific north american el niño southern oscillation north atlantic oscillation and pacific decadal oscillation besides local temperature urbanization and other climate characteristics that potentially affect rainfall patterns are also adopted when analyses are conducted for urban areas therefore it is recommended that future non stationary studies

8210,study region canada study focus given the effects of climate change on extreme precipitation updated intensity duration frequency idf relationships have been adopted across canada since the idfs generation is based on the assumption of stationarity the rainfall statistics information may be unreliable recent research is attempting to develop a new methodology to integrate non stationarity and climate change into idfs updating process up to now there is no comprehensive evaluation of the idfs updating procedure at different locations in this study we analyzed the combined effect of non stationarity and climate change on future idfs at six selected gauging stations across canada new hydrological insights for the region a comparison of the updated future idfs with historical idfs indicates an intensification of extreme events for all study areas increasing hazard to them sites located in the northeast coastal region will be the most affected in the future by the extreme precipitation in addition there is a clear indication that rare events 100 year return period will become more frequent in some cases increase up to 443 of the water infrastructure risk of failure has been observed we argue that the above findings i offer a new overview of future extreme precipitation across canada and ii should be considered by the stakeholders with respect to climate change adaptation decisions keywords extreme precipitation non stationarity climate change idf curves canada 1 introduction intensity duration frequency idf curves are the primary instrument used in hydrologic designs and stormwater risk management since they provide the characteristics of rainfall extremes agilan and umamahesh 2015 thiombiano et al 2017 idf curves are usually developed by fitting annual maximum precipitation amps series to a theoretical probability distribution under the assumption of stationarity i e the frequency of extreme precipitation events is not expected to change over time significantly however under a changing climate stationary assumption may not be valid anymore tan and gan 2016 impacting water infrastructure design and management and resulting in the rise of the associated risk of failure and reduction of the system s capacity to provide a required level of service mailhot and duchesne 2009 mailhot et al 2011 cheng et al 2014 salas and obeyesekera 2014 for example canada is experiencing a high level of damages caused by extreme precipitation according to catastrophe indices and quantification inc all the top 10 highest loss years on record have occurred in the last 22 years insurance bureau of canada 2020 in previous studies some attention has been given to non stationarity in extreme rainfall statistics using the extreme value theory evt with climate variability and change as an object of investigation for reviewing and updating idfs cheng et al 2014 yilmaz and pereira 2014 yousef and ouarda 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 regarding idf relationships specifically the studies usually focus on modelling a trend function in the location and scale parameters of the evt distribution modelling trend functions involves the introduction of one or more covariates for example cheng et al 2014 developed idf curves by assuming a linear trend in generalized extreme value gev location parameter using time as a covariate yilmaz and pereira 2014 and ganguli and coulibaly 2017 considered a similar trend function of time for location and scale parameters of gev further given the limitations related to the use of time as a covariate agilan and umamahesh 2017 ouarda et al 2018 and ouarda et al 2020 evaluated different physical processes and climate indices in addition to time to develop non stationary idf curves the use of non stationary idfs in the present period to project future rainfall extremes may not be reliable given the multiple processes that control the occurrence and intensity of precipitation especially under changing climate conditions in summary trends associated with extreme precipitation in the future may not be similar to those presented in the historical observations climate models can simulate the complex nature of the climate system and provide credible information about future climate allowing extreme value analysis and idf update much of the recent literature is focused on the improvements in reducing uncertainties involved in generating idf curves such as the spatial resolution of climate models choice of ipcc emission scenarios and selection of a downscaling approach rupa et al 2015 maraun 2016 fadhel et al 2017 cook et al 2020 however due to the complexity of considering multiple climate information choices and the limited availability of climate expertise among water practitioners there is a high level of difficulty in implementing updated idf curves in practice sandink et al 2016 simonovic et al 2016 limiting the implementation of measures for climate change adaptation today there are various approaches available for updating idf curves under future climate conditions this work builds on the publicly accessible web based tool for updating idfs known as idf cc simonovic et al 2016 developed by the western university and the institute for catastrophic loss reduction the tool covers canada and offers updated idfs at gauged and ungauged locations it has been in use since february 2015 and is currently in version 4 5 schardong et al 2020 over 3 360 registered and active users are currently using the tool as of march 25 2021 access to the idf cc tool is available at http www idf cc uwo ca idf cc adopts an original equidistance quantile matching eqm method for updating idf curves developed by srivastav et al 2014 eqm uses a two step procedure to capture the distribution changes between the projected time period and the baseline period and downscaling the amp derived from the gcm data and the observed sub daily data since its initial version the idf cc tool has been gradually improved with new functionalities and data the current version of the tool schardong et al 2020 i uses gev distribution ii uses a modified quantile matching qm algorithm for updating idf curves using the gev distribution iii provides updating of idf curves for ungauged location iv keeps the local database up to date and v includes the most current climate models the idf cc tool has been designed and implemented in response to the increased demand for incorporating climate change into the generation of future rainfall information across canada other approaches for updating future idfs have been reported in canada three of them including the idf cc use parametric probability distributions to quantify extreme rainfall quantiles nguyen et al 2007 hassanzadeh et al 2014 ganguli and coulibaly 2019 their advantage against other methods is a reduction in error propagation for projecting idf curves under future conditions they focus on specific rainfall quantiles rather than the entire time series hassanzadeh et al 2019 for example nguyen et al 2007 developed the scale invariance method sim which derives the distribution of short duration local amps based on daily amps using the scaling relationships between non central moments over different rainfall durations the authors applied their study to 15 rain gauge stations over quebec in the city of saskatoon hassanzadeh et al 2014 used genetic programming to extract the quantile quantile relationship between the amps at the gcm and local scales during a baseline period and update idf curves using predictions obtained from gcms although these methodologies present opportunities to develop future idf curves they are all limited by the stationarity assumption in future amps modelling which may underestimate overestimate the property of rainfall extremes ganguli and coulibaly 2019 used the equiratio quantile mapping wang and chen 2013 to generate future sub daily amps and then updated idf curves using a non stationary model based on the bayesian inference limited to southern ontario canada all published studies revealed a rise in magnitude and frequency in future rainfall intensities compared to the current period which can be even more intense in the presence of positive trends in extreme precipitation given the course of climate change however the studies ignore the non stationarity that may be present already in the historical period recently silva et al 2021 have revised the eqm method used by the idf cc tool to include possible non stationary behaviour into the future idfs generation first unlike the straightforward application of non stationarity in distribution modelling this new framework is based on statistical analysis which identifies if the non stationary model is the best model to be fitted to data second the method can use non stationary information in the historical period and translate it into the future also canada has experienced severe precipitation events over the years and across the country these events encouraged evaluating the climate change impacts on idf curves by applying eqmns over six selected gauging stations across canada the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the methodology used in this work section 3 presents the study area and data used conducted analyses are explained in section 4 and the discussion of the results is presented in section 5 section 6 summarizes the concluding remarks 2 methodology 2 1 study region this study is conducted using six selected rainfall gauging stations located across canada calgary alberta hamilton ontario london ontario moncton new brunswick vancouver british columbia and winnipeg manitoba as shown in fig 1 the station selection criteria included i representation of different climatic zones of canada and ii data availability more than 50 years the following zones were included through the selection of the rainfall gauging stations great lakes represented by hamilton and london gauging stations where summer precipitation is from convective showers and thunderstorms and fall precipitation characterized by reduced convective activity and increased lake effect precipitation lapen and hayhoe 2003 coastal regions being represented by vancouver station pacific coast and moncton station atlantic coast vancouver climatic variability is induced by ocean atmosphere coupling and annual precipitation modulated by el niño southern oscillation and the pacific decadal oscillation later being associated with high intensity rainfall events jacob et al 2003 western continental air masses influence moncton climate and the presence of the ocean modifies it prairies are represented by winnipeg station and with a flat topography the region is characterized by the exposure to high pressure climate systems the mountainous region represented by calgary gauging station located near the canadian rockies with extreme rainfall being affected by the orographic effects 2 2 observed and simulated data used observed maximum annual rainfall series were extracted from the six selected stations for the following sub daily durations 5 10 15 30 60 120 360 720 and 1440 minutes data is provided from the environmental and climate change canada https climate weather gc ca prods servs engineering e html last accessed july 2021 table 1 shows details of the selected gauging stations used in this study data quality control was conducted initially to remove the missing years and organize the dataset for implementing the block maxima approach in data fitting the extent of missing data in the sub daily amp series ranges between 4 6 and 22 with the least being in vancouver 2002 2003 2017 and the highest in winnipeg 1950 1955 1957 1997 2006 respectively the main impact of missing values in frequency analysis is making the quantile estimates less accurate benestad 2004 in non stationary modelling missing values can underestimate the power of the trend function although there is a presence of missing data in the time series being used all the stations include a minimum of 50 years available which is acceptable for frequency analysis zhu et al 2016 precipitation simulated data was derived from 24 gcms produced for coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 from different climate research centers ipcc 2014 table s1 see supplementary material these data are bias corrected and statistically downscaled using the bias correction constructed analogues with quantile version 2 mapping reordering bccaqv2 for canada at a gridded resolution of 10 km x 10 km for the simulated period of 1950 2100 schardong et al 2020 bccaqv2 is a hybrid method composed of bias correction constructed analogues which is used to rescale projections to match observations at the same time quantile mapping is employed to preserve the gcm trends in the downscaling daily data gudmundsson et al 2012 in summary bccaqv2 corrects the bias in daily precipitation series obtained from climate models so the distribution properties are close to historical maurer et al 2010 the models were selected based on the availability of projections for three different emissions scenarios rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 data is provided by the pacific climate impacts consortium pcic https data pacificclimate org portal downscaled gcms map last accessed august 03 2020 2 3 eqmns method in this paper we applied the eqmns method to bias correct projected amps and further assess the impacts of climate change on the intensity duration and frequency of extreme rainfall events through the updated non stationary idf curves eqmns was first proposed by silva and simonovic 2020 and silva et al 2021 as a recent improvement to the eqm method srivastav et al 2014 schardong et al 2018 2020 used with the idf cc tool eqmns can consider the possible effects of non stationarity on updating idf curves under a changing climate by including statistical analysis the proposed and implemented methodology s main steps are presented below fig 2 the eqmns method combines three main steps to generate non stationary idf curves under a changing climate i statistical modelling and analysis which model data by fitting a theoretical distribution function and assess the non stationarity of the observed historical period ii bias correction method for deriving information in the projected period and iii statistical modelling and analysis which model data by fitting a theoretical distribution function and assess the non stationarity in the projected period first statistical modelling and analysis is applied to the amps dataset we fitted an independent cumulative distribution function cdf to each sub daily amp time series this study used the generalized extreme value gev distribution which is characterized by three parameters location scale and shape for introducing non stationary behaviour in the modeling parameters distribution of observed historical data time is used as a covariate the parameters of gev are allowed to vary as a function of time nine different settings of the gev parameters one stationary and eight non stationary are considered see appendix a for the detailed list the choices include trend functions e g linear polynomial or exponential for the location and scale parameters previously applied to frequency based analyses e g el adlouni et al 2007 ouarda et al 2018 ragno et al 2018 the parameter estimation for the gev distribution is carried out using the maximum likelihood method based on eqmns it is argued that non stationary modelling needs to be considered given its potential improvements compared to the stationary model for assessing the best gev model the corrected akaike information criteria aicc is implemented to compare nine candidate models in the case of the best gev model being non stationary the likelihood ratio lr test is used to assess its statistical significance against the stationary model the use of two assessment methods was based on the complexity of the gev models adopted and the findings of kim et al 2017 in comparing model selection methods the statistical significance for nonstationary modeling is assessed at 5 significance level i e p value 0 05 in this paper we also analyzed the quality of the fitted model a goodness of fit measure commonly assesses the quality of the theoretical distribution e g kolmogorov smirnov test chi squared test probability probability plot quantile quantile plot agilan and umamahesh 2017 sugahara et al 2009 however for the sake of brevity in this paper we calculated the coefficient of determination r q q 2 associated with the quantile plot as a goodness of fit measure once the best model is identified as stationary the equidistance quantile matching eqm schardong et al 2018 method is applied in two steps i quantile based mapping to establish a statistical relationship between the gcm data and the observed sub daily precipitation spatial downscaling and ii quantile delta mapping between model baseline and projected periods to preserve the relative changes in quantiles temporal downscaling however in the case of the best gev model being non stationary the varying parameters will change with time thus a modified spatial downscaling is performed by introducing the 95th percentile of the parameter values in historical observation the modification in spatial downscaling allows translation of the non stationary information from the observed period to the projected period these downscaling procedures integrate theoretical distribution modelling information and generate sub daily amps in the projected period the final stage of eqmns refers to statistical modelling and analysis applied to future amps therefore a similar procedure to the one used at the first step is conducted to fit different gev models list provided in appendix a and assess the best gev model based on aicc and lr tests finally if the best gev model is identified as stationary the future idf curve is generated by adopting the constant set of parameters otherwise given that the best gev model is identified as non stationary the calculated 95th percentile of the varying parameters are used to estimate the future idf relationships the same values can be found with the calculated 95th percentile of future idfs changing over time a detailed mathematical description of the eqmns method can be found in silva et al 2021 2 4 numerical analyses the idf updating process under non stationary conditions implemented for all six stations includes the following steps 1 extracting of three amps datasets i the sub daily maximums from the six gauging stations i e maximums of 5 10 15 30 minutes and 1 2 6 12 24 hours precipitation data for calgary hamilton london moncton vancouver and winnipeg stations ii daily maximums for the baseline period indicated by the available years in table 1 for each location from the selected gcm models listed in table 1 and iii daily maximums for the period of 2020 2100 from the selected gcm models and the three rcp scenarios i e rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 all three datasets should be in chronological order 2 fitting the gev cumulative distribution to each observed sub daily time series based on the nine sets of parameters shown in appendix a using the maximum likelihood method 3 selecting the best gev model for each observed sub daily time series using the corrected akaike information criteria 4 in the case of the best choice being a non stationary gev model assess its statistical significance against the stationary gev model using the likelihood test at the 5 significance level 5 once the statistical significance of the non stationary gev model is checked extract the fit parameters by computing the 95th percentiles for the varying parameters otherwise extract the fit parameters of the stationary gev model 6 fitting the gev cumulative distribution to two daily amps series obtained from the gcm models i e the baseline and the projected periods based on the setting stationary gev i and using the maximum likelihood method 7 establishing a statistical relationship between the daily gcm for the baseline period and the observed sub daily series for the best gev model using the principle of quantile mapping this is the bias correction applied to data in the historical period 1 x j o h f j o h 1 f m h x m h where x is the amp for a given station and x is the bias corrected amp quantiles at the station scale for each sub daily j observed rainfall o in historical period h f is the cumulative distribution of probability and f 1 is its inverse m refers to the modelled amp data 8 developing a functional relationship between the quantiles extracted from step 7 and the daily amps gcm data for the baseline period as suggested by hassanzadeh et al 2014 the following function is used in this study 2 x j o h a j x m h b j c j x m h d j x m h where a j b j c j and d j are the adjusted coefficients of the eq 1 for each sub daily duration j a differential evolution optimization algorithm is used to find the adjusted coefficients 9 development of the statistical relationship between the daily amps gcm data for the baseline period and the daily amps gcm data for the projected period for each rcp scenario using quantile mapping 10 determining the relative change between the projected period and the historical baseline period by dividing the daily amps gcm data for the projected period by the quantiles extracted in step 9 11 calculating future sub daily time series by replacing x m h with the quantiles extracted in step 9 in eq 2 and multiplying them by the relative change calculated in step 10 12 repeating the steps 2 3 4 and 5 for each future sub daily time series to model gev distribution under stationary and non stationary conditions assess which model fits the data the best and then extracting the fit parameters 13 calculating the future idf curves using the inverse distribution function for 5 25 and 100 year return periods and comparing them with the historically observed idf curves to assess the impact of climate change on the extreme precipitation intensities 2 5 assessment of gcm models performance evaluating the impact of climate change on future rainfall extremes involves the use of climate models there are numerous climate models from the cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 https pcmdi llnl gov mips cmip5 last accessed january 25 2021 which projections are available for this purpose cmip6 models data are slowly becoming available https pcmdi llnl gov cmip6 last accessed january 25 2021 this study is using climate models from cmip5 however the outputs from different models are different and using an individual model may bring uncertainty about the future song et al 2020 therefore evaluating the performance of the climate models is an important task given the large number of cmip5 gcm models used in this study we assessed their performance relative to observations specifically in reproducing the characteristics of extreme events we used the skill score defined by taylor 2001 to evaluate the performance of gcm outputs after bias correction eq 1 taylor 2001 this score provides the information about the relative accuracy among several models and is based on the correlation coefficient and variance between modelled and observed data 3 s 4 1 r σ ˆ m 1 σ ˆ m 2 1 r 0 where s is the skill score and vary from 0 least skillful and 1 most skillful r is the correlation coefficient between gcm and observed datasets r0 is the maximum correlation coefficient attainable here r0 is 1 and σ ˆ m is the relation between the standard deviation of the gcm model data and the standard deviation of observed data 3 results this section presents the results obtained from the assessment of future idf curves for the selected six sites across canada we used the proposed eqm see schardong et al 2018 for more details and eqmns silva and simonovic 2020 silva et al 2021 methods with gev distribution to fit the probability of maximum annual precipitation and generate the future idf curves under climate change with stationary and non stationary behaviour respectively the analyses are conducted under three rcp scenarios i e rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future idfs were generated for the 2020 2100 projected period analyses were provided based on the historical and future idfs relationships the investigations carried out in this paper were aimed at answering the following four questions 1 are the historical idfs at selected locations misrepresenting the real conditions of extreme precipitation 2 is the estimated future extreme rainfall sensitive to the choice of climate model emission scenario and the frequency analysis i e stationary and non stationary conditions 3 how much rainfall intensities are expected to change in the future due to climate change 4 how will the expected changes in extreme rainfall affect the hydrologic probability of exceedance in canada precipitation design criteria differ from province to province since the selected locations are in different provinces the results were evaluated based on the probability of exceedance or return period often used in municipal drainage practices and flood risk management given by 5 year 25 year and 100 year return periods 3 1 analyses of the historical data in the context of climate change the planning of the future often builds on the understanding of the present since the use of climate projections for future idf curves integrates information from the present time in this section we briefly present the extreme precipitation statistics obtained by using historical observations the results of the analysis with recorded sub daily amps at selected sites are given in table 2 together with the best gev based model identified by statistical tests the coefficient of determination r q q 2 associated with the plot of modelled and empirical quantiles are presented in table s2 as an assessment of the accuracy of the adopted model there is no clear spatial pattern of trend in precipitation among the considered regions of canada only the moncton station shows a significant non stationary behaviour in gev modelling over most of the durations no change pattern i e trend detection is confirmed for all durations at two sites under the influence of great lakes london and hamilton the same findings were observed by ganguli and coulibaly 2019 for hamilton and london stations for 60 min and 1440 min durations however they have used a different data period and another statistical test to detect monotonic trends mann kendall test the non stationary model was the best gev model for vancouver and winnipeg stations for only one duration 360 min and 1440 min respectively non stationary behaviour for the calgary station was noted for 10 min and 720 min durations for daily precipitation our results are consistent with previous studies e g tan and gan 2016 tan et al 2017 these findings suggest that there is a general misrepresentation of the idf relationships for the moncton station given the presence of non stationary behaviour for almost all the rainfall durations for 1440 min precipitation our results are consistent with previous studies e g tan and gan 2016 tan et al 2017 these findings suggest that there is a general misrepresentation of the idf relationships for the moncton station given the presence of non stationary behaviour for different rainfall durations especially those longer than 1 h 3 2 performance of gcm models in this section we present the performance of the 24 bias corrected gcm models in addition to their median ensemble med ensemble i e the median of amp from all the gcm models in reproducing the extreme quantiles in the baseline period using taylor s skill scores fig 3 presents heat maps for assessing the skill scores for different durations using rcp 8 5 climate projections figs s1 and s2 are available in the supplementary material for other rcps note that we used abbreviated station names cal is calgary hal is hamilton lon is london mon is moncton van is vancouver and win is winnipeg the models overall skill score was higher than 0 30 which is considered an average score variations in the skill scores are more significant among locations than among the models among durations the variability is higher for small durations in this paper we used models with different spatial resolutions the performance evaluation of the models in characterizing the extreme events for different durations shows that the worst skill scores are not related to low resolution models however most of the models with finer spatial resolution have an excellent performance compared to the others for example the ccsm4 model has a better agreement higher skill score for vancouver than for hamilton while the performance of mri cgcm3 shows the opposite results otherwise both models show similar spatial performance compared to a single model the performance of the median ensemble models is often lower nevertheless med ensemble shows moderate to good performance for all the locations with a skill score ranging from 0 35 for rcp2 6 to 0 67 for rcp8 5 3 3 analyses of updated idf curves for future conditions in this section two types of results are presented i comparison between stationary and non stationary idf curves for future conditions and ii comparison of idf curves for different locations across canada in order to evaluate how sensitive is the future extreme precipitation to the choice of different climate models and the frequency analysis approach i e stationary or non stationary boxplots of rainfall depths for 5 25 and 100 year return periods are presented in figs 4 6 for rcp 8 5 results for other rcps are available in figs s3 s8 in the supplementary material boxplots are able to capture the variations and the uncertainty in generated idfs using different climate models the boxplots show the interquartile range iqr defined as the range between the lower and upper quartiles defined as the 25th and 75th percentile of rainfall depths for the 24 climate models used in general the values estimated for precipitation under stationary conditions underestimate those values estimated under non stationary conditions also there is a larger iqr for non stationary behaviour when compared to a stationary behaviour these results illustrate how much future rainfall can vary between models and how non stationary modelling can enlarge these variations previous studies have pointed that the non stationary models given their complexity lead to more uncertainty than the stationary models ouarda et al 2020 for example for vancouver station the 360 min 25 year event iqrs produced under stationary conditions for rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are 5 26 mm 4 92 mm and 8 63 mm respectively while iqrs produced for non stationary conditions for the same scenarios are 10 14 mm 5 78 mm 12 01 mm respectively the use of different climate models is another source of uncertainty as discussed in cook et al 2020 therefore given the good performance of the median ensemble presented in section 3 2 we used it to estimate the rainfall intensities for future climate conditions table 3 for rcp 8 5 and tables s3 and s4 for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 respectively in the case of short durations e g 60 min great lakes and prairies are the climatic regions that will experience the highest rainfall intensity by the end of the century these findings are presented for both stationarity and non stationarity conditions for events longer than 60 min there is no regular spatial pattern for different return periods results in table 3 and tables s3 and s4 indicate that for all locations rainfall intensities under stationary assumption are below the rainfall intensities under non stationary behaviour since we only considered non stationarity after checking its statistical significance against the stationary conditions these results suggest a positive trend associated with future extreme rainfall rcp 8 5 is the most critical emission scenario and non stationarity is more significant for all locations the positive trend is most visible for the moncton station given the difference between precipitation depths for stationary and non stationary conditions for all durations and return periods in fact both coastal locations moncton and vancouver and mountainous location calgary show that these climatic regions are the most affected by non stationarity in idf curves in other words these regions will experience a higher positive trend in extreme precipitation in future when compared to other regions for mountainous and coastal locations the effect of non stationarity is expressive for lower return periods e g 5 year in moncton for rcp 8 5 the 1440 min 100 year return period event increased about 2 7 mm h 1 by using the non stationarity approach compared to 0 7 mm h 1 for stationary in vancouver for the 360 min 25 year return period event this difference reaches 0 8 mm h 1 for rcp 4 5 the climate regions like great lakes represented by london and hamilton locations and prairies represented by winnipeg are the less affected regions by considering non stationarity in future idf curves for hamilton station non stationarity has only affected results under rcp 8 5 for london the future non stationary idf relationships increased up to 7 and 26 for the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 respectively compared to the future stationary idf relationships for winnipeg the 360 min 25 year return period event the increase is only 1 1 mm h 1 when the non stationarity is considered in the development of idfs 3 4 comparison between current and idf curves for future conditions the summary of the change in the idf curves obtained using both stationary and non stationary assumptions for the selected stations and rcp 8 5 emission scenario is presented using the heat maps in fig 7 figs s9 and s10 for rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios respectively the results are presented using the med ensemble the relative change in the rainfall intensity by the end of the century versus the historical period is calculated as follows 4 r e l a t i v e c h a n g e 100 z t f z t h z t h where relative change is given as the percent of change of rainfall intensity in the future when compared to the rainfall intensity in the present period z t f is the rainfall intensity in the future period and z t h is the rainfall intensity in the historical period the results indicate an increase related to the observed period for all locations durations and rcps which suggest that extreme events are expected to be intensified in the future relative changes show the direct effect of non stationarity on the magnitude of future extreme precipitation comparison to the stationary conditions and give further details among return periods and climatic zones these results have a practical value for the hydrologists since they represent the so called safety factor and can be used to adjust current design values ragno et al 2018 the results do not reveal a pattern of change among the three considered rcps and the increase in precipitation does not follow the severity of the emission scenario in fact for the rcp 4 5 the relative change is often lower than for the other scenarios the nature of the climate models simulated data and the assessed trend support these findings for example the relative change of estimated precipitation for calgary is smaller for rcp 4 5 than rcp 2 6 these observations occur for both stationary and non stationary cases despite the different magnitudes some information about changes across different climate zones in canada can be also extracted from the presented results as shown in fig 7 for locations near oceans the precipitation is expected to increase more than for continental areas in general moncton located at the east atlantic coast of canada shows the most significant increase in extreme precipitation on the other side vancouver results suggest a similar behaviour at the pacific coast in the great lakes hamilton and london show a similar increase in the stationary case on the other hand the london location shows a higher increase than hamilton for the non stationary case indicating that the effects of non stationarity intensify the extreme precipitation in london a previous study applied to stations in southern ontario has revealed different patterns between locations ganguli and coulibaly 2019 for the rcp2 6 for example the stations located close to the great lakes show a negative relative change suggesting that precipitation will be reduced under this scenario in the future for the stations located in prairie and mountainous regions non stationarity is significant only for the rcp 8 5 3 5 the main implications results generated through the presented research are confirming that one of the main consequences of climate change is an increase in extreme precipitation in addition adopting a non stationary assumption results in further intensification of the magnitude and frequency of these impacts in urban environments these changes directly affect the performance level of urban infrastructure systems pointing to the necessity for better risk communication of hazardous climatic conditions as suggested by ragno et al 2018 in this study we evaluated the expected future return period of events which based on 120 min and 1440 min historical observations have a return period of 5 and 100 years respectively these specific events are selected based on their practical use in infrastructure design and management in canada simonovic et al 2017 and may help to improve the understanding of future climate change impacts on the frequency of extreme precipitation events table 4 provides the observed rainfall intensity for all selected locations observed rainfall intensity was estimated using a stationary gev model table 5 shows the return period expected in the future under the rcp 8 5 scenario tables s5 and s6 present the results for rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 respectively for moncton location for example events expected to occur every year with the probability of 1 5 will become more frequent and are expected to occur every year with the probability of 1 1 4 similarly 100 year events for the winnipeg location will become about 18 year events these results indicate an increase of about 257 and 443 of projected precipitation hazards in the future respectively warning of potentially severe impacts on society and infrastructure safety this particular concern seems to be outstanding in moncton city in which extreme precipitation is expected to substantially increase in magnitude as shown in the previous section and frequency also the coastal area of the province of new brunswick where moncton is located is sensitive to sea level rise and associated storm impacts not considered in these research analyses braden and simonovic 2020 hydrological risk is quite similar for vancouver which arises an emergent warning for the coastal areas in the case of winnipeg for high frequency events the reduction of return periods is very low while low frequency events will be subject to very significant change future hazards are also quite different for london and hamilton for high return periods despite their spatial closeness the hydrological risk in london will be higher in the future given the effects of non stationarity presented in future precipitation 4 conclusions in this study we have applied a non stationary framework in order to update idf curves for future climate conditions to detect the non stationarity of amps series the time year is used as a covariate to estimate the parameters of the non stationary distribution this procedure was implemented for nine durations of precipitation at six different gauging stations across canada classified as a climate zone there is no clear pattern of non stationary behaviour among durations and climate change projections variation of trends is observed from station to station given the differences between local characteristics and climate future idfs are updated adopting stationary and non stationary approaches and using 24 gcm models under three rcp scenarios 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 the results emphasize the sensitivity of idfs to the choice of a climate model in addition others source of uncertainties includes i the non stationarity presented in the observed period and ii the non stationarity presented in the projected period given a large number of conducted experiments with each of 24 gcm models different results are shown for the gcm ensemble intense precipitation will increase for most locations durations and return periods consideration of non stationary behaviour is making this increase even more expressive as we considered a 95 confidence level for non stationarity detection these insights indicate the need for revisiting water infrastructure design and management practice in canada among climatic zones our findings point to a high hazard for sites located at the atlantic coast i e moncton location with a trend in extreme historical precipitation for this specific location an increase of extreme precipitation is expected in a greater proportion than for the other locations in the future coastal areas are exposed to the compounding risks associated with the impacts of the ocean cities near the water bodies may experience a higher magnitude of change between current and future conditions interestingly we found that inland areas will experience a lower increase in precipitation intensity however given the local rainfall patterns the projected future hazard may increase significantly as indicated for the locations in the canadian prairies several climate indices have been associated with variability and extreme precipitation across canada they include arctic oscillation pacific north american el niño southern oscillation north atlantic oscillation and pacific decadal oscillation besides local temperature urbanization and other climate characteristics that potentially affect rainfall patterns are also adopted when analyses are conducted for urban areas therefore it is recommended that future non stationary studies

8211,study region leech lake aquifer city of yorkton saskatchewan canadian prairies study focus groundwater and surface water interactions have been conducted numerically for bringing out a sustainable management of the leech lake aquifer in the southern portion of city of yorkton area within the province of saskatchewan canada the aquifer is composed of highly conductive sediments over bedrock strata with low hydraulic conductivity a fully coupled physically based surface groundwater flow model using hydrogeosphere hgs is developed for the purpose of simulation in this numerical model different withdrawal scenarios and the effects of climate variabilities precipitation and snowmelt are being conducted to investigate the impact of water usage on groundwater level new hydrological insights for the region groundwater from several aquifers serves as the main water supply for the city of yorkton aquifer protection and sustainable use of the limited resource is of utmost importance to the municipality and in support of economic development in the region insight and understanding of the risks and impact to the municipal groundwater supply is required to address the sustainability of the aquifers in the area a numerical model was developed to provide greater comprehension of the surface and groundwater fluxes model calibration and validation was completed with existing long term monitoring information from piezometers in the area in the semi arid environment of the prairie provinces water withdrawal and precipitation plays a significant role in affecting groundwater level different withdrawal scenarios are conducted to investigate the impact of the water usage on the leech lake aquifer that will provide a tool to support the development of a sustainable management plan precipitation as well as snowmelt have been incorporated into the model to identify the driving recharge factor for groundwater variation temporal and spatial variabilities as well as estimation of magnitude for exchange flow rates at the interfaces are presented the fully integrated model developed in this study provides the foundation for future groundwater management applications in climate driven changes within the prairie environment keywords fully coupled model surface ground water interactions groundwater flux precipitation snowmelt 1 introduction the understanding of watershed hydrology including both groundwater and surface water gw sw is crucial for sustainable water management the interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies i e rivers lakes streams wetlands are an important feature of hydrological cycle however in the past this interaction has been considered independently winter et al 1999 and overlooked in many cases particularly in semi arid regions fleckenstein et al 2010 hydrologic modeling is a strategic technique to the understanding of the gw sw interactions jolly et al 2010 mare et al 2007 rassam et al 2012 currently it is gaining prominence in the understanding of the complex interaction flux that is incorporated into hydrological numerical simulations as shown in some of the comprehensive reviews brunner et al 2009 sophocleous 2000 unland et al 2013 however uncertainties still exist in interaction modeling arnold et al 2012 muñoz carpena et al 2006 reckhow 2003 these uncertainties could arise from different aspects such as the presence of structural controls channel networks tanner and hughes 2015 in an interconnected hydrological system groundwater discharge may play an important role on total flow to surface water bodies and vice versa groundwater withdrawal by means of pumping can be considered as one of the critical issues under this context which largely impacts the groundwater and surface water balance alley 2007 feinstein and reeves 2010 zhou 2009 surface water especially in dry seasons can also be largely affected by groundwater withdrawal and thereby induces considerable fluctuations on the level of the water table sanz et al 2011 the gw sw interactions could be impacted by human activities such as agriculture urbanization etc geological topographical and climatic factors of the study region have a major impact on the gw sw interactions process haria et al 2013 ivkovic 2009 the combined effect of topography geology and climate is a prerequisite in investigating the interactions the interactions could be significantly different from one area to another area especially in the prairie environment due to its highly diversified geology and climate large variation in aquifer categories varying recharge and groundwater flow circumstances as well as a large array of river flow surroundings alley et al 1999 for instance the groundwater resources in eastern canada are heavily dependent on precipitation and flow from the atlantic ocean chaillou et al 2016 whereas in western canada and the prairies this may not be the fact two basic techniques have been found in simulating gw sw interactions namely comprehensive and marginal models comprehensive models are physically based approach in which ground water and surface water models can be coupled and thereby simulated gw sw interaction in terms of hydraulic head and hydraulic connectivity however insufficient data on geology aquifer characteristics could result in numerical convergence difficulties in this physically based approach reilly and harbaugh 2004 woods et al 2003 on the other hand marginal models can simulate the degree of sw gw interaction through water transfer between diverse conceptual layers which is not data intensive combined with lower computation resources in this approach model verification could be complicated due to the absence of a representation of the water table consideration of flow among different catchments is essential when applying such systems barthel and banzhaf 2016 furman 2008 great lakes science advisory board 2018 fully coupled schemes have been used as physics based models to integrate saturated zone unsaturated zone and surface waters the modified richards equation has been well used as the governing equation for groundwater flows to consider both saturated and unsaturated zones in one framework for surface water the depth averaged saint venant equation has been mostly used governing equations including both surface and groundwater flow are resolved concurrently in fully coupled scheme brunner and simmons 2012 loague et al 2006 only one calculating platform is needed which could significantly reduce computing efforts fully coupled scheme is mostly preferred to consider all hydrological processes in one catchment for gw sw interactions comparing to other methods such as loosely coupled scheme the interaction between surface water and groundwater is complicated due to the existence of many factors such as uncertainty of land cover and aquifer properties which can cause substantial errors in model output eslamian and nekoueineghad 2009 sophocleous 2010 straatsma et al 2013 a fully integrated physically based numerical model is well capable of handling these factors alaghmand et al 2014 hydrogeosphere hgs fully integrated model has been selected for this research because of its capability to address some of these complexities while considering a large scale study therrien 2011 hydrogeosphere can simulate the dynamic interactions between all sub domains at each time step although there exist several numerical schemes e g finite difference and finite volume methods el amin et al 2011 salama et al 2014 sun et al 2012 hgs discretizes the governing differential equations using implicit galerkin finite element method in hgs rainfall precipitation is branched into components such as evapotranspiration runoff and infiltration hgs allows for the computation of water infiltration or exfiltration between rivers lakes and aquifers these interactions play a significant role in the prediction of future scenarios with respect to climate change since recharge precipitation snowmelt is very susceptible to climatic fluctuations the integrated hydrological model simulates flow in the subsurface and surface domains by considering numerous hydrological variables such as hydraulic head or surface water depth groundwater head and fluid exchange between compartments these parameters are calculated simultaneously at each time step relationship of relative permeability and saturation have been established using van genuchten 1980 or brooks and corey 1964 relationships on the other hand the two dimensional depth averaged flow is normally used for surface water modeling as one of the fully coupled models hgs has been well applied in the past with its capacities and wide application for different geometric configurations integration of surface flow groundwater flow and evapotranspiration competence of hgs is critical to generate a better representation of recharge mechanism which has been approved in the geer basin region goderniaux et al 2009 it is also found that four parameters hydraulic conductivity porosity the van genuchten parameter and the channel manning coefficient can have a large impact on simulation results an et al 2018 van genuchten 1980 additionally hgs has been utilized at the regional scales such as the san joaquin valley however to date very limited research can be found on the application of hgs in the prairies of semi arid regions to fill in this gap the present research is conducted to investigate the gw sw interaction around the leech lake on a regional scale in saskatchewan canada the hgs model is calibrated and validated using the field data water withdrawal scenarios have been completed to provide potential outcomes from over use and to inform groundwater management decisions this main body of the article is divided primarily into two sections 1 methodology and 2 results and analysis where the methodology section of this paper represents the study site leech lake aquifer information governing equations of hgs model and the numerical model set up discretization details and boundary conditions assigned the result and analysis section demonstrates the model calibration and validation as well as scenario analysis for the management of the leech lake aquifer finally concluding remarks regarding the findings of the study in the context of sustainability issues have been stated 2 methodology 2 1 study site the city of yorkton is located in southeastern saskatchewan which is solely dependent on groundwater for its main water supply fig 1 groundwater has played a vital role in the city of yorkton s municipal water supply over the last century the groundwater supply is originates from fourteen production wells expanding over five well fields with an average withdrawal rate ranging from 2000 000 3 000 000 m3 year the average annual precipitation in the region is around 435 mm year from 1910 to 2014 environment canada a minimum rainfall of 237 mm year in 2001 up to a maximum of 734 mm year in 1957 has been noted maathuis et al 2006 the yorkton region encompasses townships t 23 26 ranges r 2 6 west of the second meridian the study area for this investigation includes townships 24 26 ranges 3 4 west of the second meridian as shown in fig 2 the topography of this review region varies from 520 m above sea level m asl in the southwest to 480 m asl north of the city of yorkton the formation of leech lake aquifer is primarily based on sands and gravels and this aquifer lies in townships 23 24 and the southern part of township 25 range 4 w2m as shown in fig 2 this aquifer comprises two hydraulically attached aquifer units leech lake aquifer and the otthon aquifer maathuis and simpson 2006 the northern section of the leech lake aquifer is an intertill aquifer of 10 m 20 m thick that is comprised of interglacial sands and gravels the western section is hydraulically connected with the otthon aquifer which is overlain by 5 10 m thick aquitard characterized as till whereas the eastern part is overlain by 10 20 m thick aquitard maathuis and simpson 2006 water security agency 2015 aquifers in the yorkton area are extremely heterogeneous transmissivity values of many aquifers fluctuate by one order of magnitude in this region aquifer transmissivity of leech lake is between 3 7 102 m2 d min to 3 5 103 m2 d max maathuis and simpson 2006 water security agency 2015 leech lake and crescent lakes are the main surface waterbodies within the study area fig 3 leech lake is a confined aquifer that has the capacity to produce up to 1 000 000 m3 year the recharge rate of an aquifer is governed largely on the thickness type of the overlying aquitard or soil hayashi et al 2016 van der kamp and hayashi 2009 for the leech lake aquifer system the overlying clay till aquitard is relatively thick approximately 20 60 m with a thick overlying till aquifer the average recharge is expected to be in the range of 3 5 over the leech lake aquifer systems maathuis and simpson 2006 water security agency 2015 hydrographs of production and monitoring wells showed that the long term groundwater levels of leech lake aquifers were not being affected by groundwater withdrawals moderately low drawdowns with the combination of high pumping rates highlights the nature of relatively high hydraulic conductivity of this aquifer system for this reason recovery of water levels had been detected in the past for the leech lake aquifer just within several days upon the cessation of pumping water security agency 2015 the general information and input parameters used in the leech lake aquifer zone are summarized in table 1 the observation well and production well location are shown in fig 3 hydraulic conductivity of till layers could be increased by at least two orders of magnitude due to the existence of fractured till in the upper 8 m this phenomenon leads to the possibility of higher recharge to the underlying aquifer van der kamp and hayashi 1998 the south well field is located at the top of a topographic ridge which ranges from northwest to southeast of yorkton making it challenging to assume groundwater flow direction with limited hydraulic head information from the observation wells however it was identified that the groundwater flow is flowing towards the production wells based on the instantaneous water level assessment maathuis and simpson 2006 the average yearly withdrawal from the leech lake well field wells 8 and 9 was 819 000 m3 between 1970 and 2004 a total volume of approximately 28 670 000 m3 was extracted from this well field until till 2004 most importantly the south wellfield contributes approximately 41 of the total water supply to the cityt of yorkton from 1983 to 2002 however withdrawal volumes from this wellfield was reduced to 13 in 2013 water security agency 2015 records of historical withdrawal from the leech lake aquifer for three the different time frames can be found in table 2 2 2 governing equations the geospatial data i e dem soil and land usage and climate data i e precipitation snow evapotranspiration are required for the hgs modeling model simulation could be based on the spatial resolutions of dem and climate data beeson et al 2014 chaubey et al 2005 cotter et al 2003 dixon and earls 2009 as a physically based fully coupled model the following equations are used in hgs including mass conservation for both subsurface and surface water domains and auxiliary equations for

the surface subsurface interface and k r s o is the coupling relative permeability rill storage 2 3 model setup and boundary conditions in the present simulation both surface and subsurface model domains are spatially discretized into triangular grids the 2 d mesh comprising of 3 node elements was constructed using gridbuilder shown in fig 4 the triangular 2 d grid mesh of surface water domain was refined as that of the whole domain which is necessary for the surface and groundwater interaction at every segment of the prescribed area this 2 d mesh was draped over the 3 d subsurface mesh fig 4a consisting of 6 node elements as illustrated in fig 4 b so that the geometry and the top most nodes in the 3 d properly match with the 2 d mesh the elevation for the bottom bedrock layer and middle interface layer i e between aquifer and aquitard nodes were generated using surfer 16 for the surface layer elevation geospatial canada data was used with the most updated digital elevation model dem and digital surface model dsm this fully integrated approach permits water input as rainfall and snowmelt to be partitioned into different components surface or overland flow evaporation infiltration to unsaturated soil or directly to gw in a physically based fashion the leech lake aquifer subsurface model section is represented by 10 uniformly distributed sublayers consisting of 6 node triangular prismatic elements to reduce long computational time with better representation of the subsurface domain fig 4b of the 10 layers the upper six layers situated just below ground surface are considered as an aquitard covered by sandy clay or silty clay materials on the other hand the remaining bottom four layers are considered as an aquifer which is occupied with sand from the top to the bottom of the subsurface domain in the subsurface domain a total of 32 370 nodes and 56 664 elements enclosed the simulation domain out of the 56 664 elements the deepest 18 888 elements represent the sandy aquifer with an average hydraulic conductivity of 1 05 10 3 m s water security agency 2015 the remaining upper 37 776 elements represent the aquitard layer with an average hydraulic conductivity of 3 03 10 9 m s as determined during the calibration phase the output of the hgs simulation reports saturation hydraulic head and exchange fluxes surface water depth velocity field and other variables bedrock elevation as well as the middle layer distinguishing aquitard and aquifer interface have been established using surfer 16 from the value of different cross sectional log index obtained from src report maathuis and simpson 2006 in the surface domain hydrogeosphere hgs illustrates 2 d surface flow with the help of the solution from the diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equations the extent of the lateral boundaries of the surface zone coincides with those at the top of the subsurface domain furthermore the mesh of the surface domain coincides with the mesh at the top surface of the porous medium domain thereby the surface water elevation can be explained as the hydraulic head value of the topmost subsurface mesh node the surface flow domain has been included primarily for simulating overland flow over the domain interaction with the subsurface is incorporated via coupling terms as manifested in eqs 1 and 3 surface flow domain consists of one overland flow zone where 6296 elements and 3237 nodes have been selected initial water level has been fixed through a trial and error procedure by adjusting the withdrawal and recharge precipitation in this case rates after obtaining desired initial water level the simulation was executed for a particular timeframe without any interference of withdrawal and recharge so that modeling system could get enough time to stabilize due to previous changes fig 5 shows contours of elevation and water depth both in meters at the finishing time of the transient phase 14 years in the model domain both the leech lake aquifer for the subsurface portion and leech lake and crescent lakes for the surface domain have been considered other aquifers streams or lakes are not considered since no significant impact on the leech lake aquifer can be found from previous studies nor from the field data therefore no flow boundary conditions were applied along the perimeter of both porous media and surface domain the entire model domain is considered as a closed reservoir system additionally a critical depth boundary condition is imposed on the topmost surface layer this setting serves as an outlet to drain extra surface water to avoid ponding this critical depth boundary condition pushes the water elevation at the boundary to be approximately equal to the critical depth which reduces the energy of flowing water in comparison to the stream bottom goderniaux et al 2009 therrien et al 2010 however values of water fluxes are not presumed to a time step rather than being computed during the simulation by this fully coupled integrated model this calculation is based on the hydraulic head difference between the associated surface and subsurface domains along with the multiplication of a leakage factor this factor is inversely proportional to coupling length lc l defining the properties of the underlying soil goderniaux et al 2009 and have been prescribed explicitly in the governing flow equations the precipitation snowmelt data and pumping rates are used as specified hydrological fluxes in the leech lake aquifer catchment historical precipitation and temperature data were obtained from environment canada weather stations near the city of yorkton from 1945 to 2019 an average precipitation data of 435 mm year was applied initially for spinning up the model and thereby reaching into the initial state for both surface and subsurface systems water security agency 2015 the snowmelt data are obtained from the yorkton rcmp snow station data from these weather stations are incorporated as daily input and applied as specified fluxes on the surface layer groundwater abstraction rates from well 8 and well 9 are utilized on a monthly basis from january 2002 to december 2015 water security agency 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation assumption of boundary conditions initial head and aquifer properties can be mentioned as the largest uncertainty of the model however it would be impossible to create any numerical model without making any assumptions or simplifications sensitivity analysis is then required to quantify the uncertainty in the calibrated model caused by estimated hydraulic parameters and or boundary conditions it also helps in identifying the parameters that influence the model results during a sensitivity analysis exercise variation of calibrated values of hydraulic parameters have been executed by changing one parameter at a time and the model s response is being observed and compared with available measurements from this analysis it has been found that hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard layer is the most sensitive parameter due to the lack of the hydraulic conductivity measurements overlying aquitard in the leech lake aquifer region different values of hydraulic conductivity have been tested and compared to the measured values manual calibration were conducted within the specified pumping period jan 2002 to dec 2015 using water level data from existing wells completed in the leech lake aquifer data from four monitoring wells operated by wsa 99 01 99 02 99 03 and 99 04 were used in the calibration procedure wsa operated wells were used in the calibration exercise because of their location adjacent to main production wells and the availability of measured hydraulic head data for the specified time interval based on the water levels from both observed and simulation results it appears the water levels from wells 99 01 99 02 and 99 03 have been affected by production the highest drawdowns 1 5 m occurred in 99 01 in 2009 and 2010 and the lowest drawdowns up to 0 5 m were observed in 99 03 due to distant location of 99 04 observation well from the main production wells fluctuations of groundwater level were minimal from the calibration phase based on this analysis it could be stated that the effects of withdrawals on the leech lake aquifer could spread up to 3 km to the west of the production wells however effects of pumping to the east of the production wells could not be identified due to the deficiency of monitoring locations typical hydrogeological characteristics of aquitards are usually heterogeneous and inconsistent aquitards are also usually non uniform in thickness hydraulic measurements are extremely difficult to collect within aquitards in the study site to obtain a reliable perception of aquitard characteristics investigation of water level data from overlying and underlying aquifers were taken from previous investigations bradbury 1985 cherry et al 2004 kellner 2007 the influence of the accumulated sediment at the bed of the two existing primary lakes crescent and leech has been determined by using different hydraulic conductivity values the bottom sediment layer has a tight soil clay or a relatively less impermeable soil silty clay it is important to examine its influence of the bottom layers therefore several simulation runs have been performed however no significant effect can be noted using lower hydraulic conductivity values hence in the present simulation a constant value of 3 03 10 9 m s for hydraulic conductivity is used for the entire aquitard region the calibration results are shown in fig 6 with good agreement between simulation and measured results additionally quantitative sensitivity analysis is conducted and listed in table 3 four objective functions have been applied for the analysis nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse percent bias p bias and mean absolute error mae the simulation results were evaluated based on the criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2007 satisfactory 0 5 nse 0 65 0 and 15 p bias 25 good 0 65 nse 0 75 and 10 p bias 15 and very good 0 75 nse 1 0 and p bias 10 the rmse and mae would be defined as accurate when the error values approaches zero from this analysis it can be found that the hydraulic conductivity value is satisfactory as shown in fig 7 model validation was completed to compare the simulation results for the other two monitoring wells src 99 02 and src 99 03 with the same withdrawal rate precipitation and snowmelt conditions and timeframe the results for src 99 02 can be seen in figs 8 and 9 and table 4 a good agreement with measurement in this well is noted from the calibration and validation the model is capable of simulating groundwater heads to reproduce the gw sw exchange fluxes in the leech lake aquifer various variables were applied to the model to predict the impact of climate and withdrawal conditions affecting the groundwater levels 3 2 scenario analysis the following scenarios are proposed to investigate the groundwater withdrawal and climatic conditions affecting the groundwater level table 5 lists the details and rationale of each scenario completed for the study 3 2 1 100 year withdrawal scenario a hypothetical scenario of excessive withdrawal under extreme drought condition within 100 year period is proposed in determining the rate of withdrawal that will result in the depletion of the aquifer five production wells were incorporated into the model over a 100 year period neither recharge from precipitation nor snowmelt is incorporated in this specific scenario the regional surface topography of area shows that the southern portion of the aquifer is higher than the northern and middle regions therefore the pumping rate is set with higher values from the production well located in the southern portion of the model domain as compared to the other four withdrawal wells different withdrawal rates of the five production wells were applied to identify the evacuation stage the model results show that the optimal withdrawal rate of 6 622 000 m3 year from the southern well and 4 415 000 m3 year from the other four wells for 100 years could deplete the aquifer as shown in fig 10 fig 11 a b show the saturation contour map of the model domain from the beginning to the end of the simulation respectively the estimation of the exchange flow rates between the ground and surface is critical to evaluate the effect of withdrawal scenarios on water level in the lakes the vertical exchange flow rate between the gw sw interface can be calculated as 8 q v a q j d a where q v is the magnitude of the volume flow rate along the vertical direction q is the exchange flux vector at the interface and j is the unit vector in the vertical direction exchange flow rates have been recorded during the simulation of this evacuation scenario the exchange flow rate and water depth at the interface between crescent lake and the underlying subsurface is shown in fig 12 the seepage flow rate from the lake to the water table increases significantly at the beginning of the withdrawal scenario and subsequently decreases to zero the sharp increase is a direct consequence of the change in hydraulic head as the lake is fully saturated with the decrease in the saturation of the lake the exchange flow rate decreases correspondingly with further decrease in saturation there would be no exchange between the surface and groundwater the water depth also drops from 0 8 m to 0 m corresponding to the variation of the exchange flow rate it noteworthy that the exchange is a complex process and depends on the topology of the lake surface the exchange flow rate approaches 0 after 13 years which indicates that no significant amount of water remain in the lake that may contribute to the underlying subsurface portion of that region to obtain an understanding of the exchange flux for the remainder of the model domain excluding crescent lake the magnitude and trend of the exchange flow rate is illustrated in fig 13 the exchange flux is similar to crescent lake however the depletion of the aquifer took a longer period of approximately 45 years the extended period is attributed to the larger study area and the variability of the porous material as opposed to evaluating the flux of crescent lake 3 2 2 aquifer yield scenarios to investigate the sustainability of the leech lake aquifer the aquifer yield under different pumping stresses from two production wells well 08 and 09 and four observation wells 99 01 99 02 99 03 and 99 04 are simulated in total 1 year 5 years 10 years 20 years 50 years and 100 years are simulated to identify the optimal withdrawal rate in ensuring sustainable use of the groundwater resource the following assumptions are made in this scenario analysis the available head for the two wells is assumed to be 17 m table 6 this value represents the available head in well 09 which is considered as a conservative approach as it is the lowest value in the entire domain the top of the aquifer is represented as the middle layer as mentioned in the previous section equal pumping rates are used for both wells table 7 and fig 14 shows the calculation of total withdrawals to ensure sustainable drawdown level for different time frames the cumulative volume was determined by applying the total pumping rate multiplied by the duration of withdraws the most critical and sensitive region in this regard is the location where the water level would be affected most due to pumping of water in comparison to the other observation wells for this reason the sustainable level is assumed as the level of the aquifer top elevation 492 5 m at the production site the simulation is conducted in transient mode with fluctuating pumping rates under each time frame until the drawdown in the pumping wells approached 17 m table 7 however higher withdrawal rate could be possible for shorter time span in transient scenarios for example water from the leech lake aquifer could be pumped at rates of 8 200 000 m3 year for up to five years to maintain the sustainable level as shown in table 7 the water level becomes unsustainable after approximately 11 years and the water levels would have dropped below aquifer s top at the production site the transient scenarios also reveal that the aquifer can be pumped at rate as high as 12 616 000 m3 for up to one 1 year however pumping at such excessively high rates may result in higher than anticipated drawdowns in the pumping wells due to well losses withdrawal rate should be decreased if the aquifer needs to be pumped for longer period cumulatively more water can be extracted if the aquifer is pumped at lower pumping rates but for longer periods overall for transient stage drawdowns at the observation wells had been examined for longer pumping time as depicted in table 7 3 2 3 impact of climate variabilities on groundwater climate change plays a significant role in affecting groundwater intense climate extremes such as droughts and floods are expected to increase climatic variabilities will likely have an impact on the rate of recharge resulting on the availability of groundwater to support municipal use precipitation and snowmelt are considered as the largest variables affecting recharge in the study area the canadian prairies receives less than 500 mm per year of precipitation burn et al 2008 dumanski et al 2015 more than 80 of the streamflow occurs as snowmelt over frozen soils even though snowfall accounts for one third of the total precipitation only gray and landine 1988 modeling of different water balance elements is uncertain and complicated one major uncertainty in the simulation is the identification of precipitation and snowmelt weight in the simulation dawes et al 2012 tanner and hughes 2015 in the present study both precipitation and snowmelt are incorporated in the model simulations to determine the driving recharge factor and its influence on the surrounding region for ensuring sustainability and feasible management of the leech lake aquifer fig 15 illustrates the historical precipitation and snowmelt amounts collected from two different weather stations for the entire simulation period 2002 2015 the data are presented where snowmelt recharges are showing peak values but occurring for a shorter period over the years on the other hand precipitation values are not showing as many peak values but it occurs throughout the year however it is difficult to identify the primary recharge contributor either rainfall or snowmelt in this study region from this point of view two separate simulations in the presence of withdrawals one for the precipitation alone and the other for the snowmelt only have been conducted these two simulations have been compared with the observation data from 99 01 99 02 and 99 03 monitoring wells the data for observation well 99 01 is illustrated in fig 16 it is evident that the simulation with only precipitation has a better agreement with the field data as compared to the simulation only with snowmelt both simulation results show similar trend or pattern in the modeling domain the withdrawal from the existing production wells 08 and 09 are much higher than both the precipitation and snowmelt this suggests the shape and trends of the simulation are mainly dominated by the withdrawal rates negligible influences of the precipitation and snowmelt have been found in changing the pattern of simulation graphs however these recharge variabilities precipitation snowmelt only serve as a factor in shifting the simulation graphs from a lower level to higher level of groundwater heads 4 conclusions groundwater surface water and its associated aquatic ecosystems are considered as an integrated entity under one water resources management unit for this reason water resources management is experiencing a major paradigm shift controlling and predictive measures of designing systems are being upgraded frequently by the technical experts for the establishment of better and adaptive management practices to address the complexities of social ecological systems from this perspective a robust methodology using a fully integrated ground and surface water modeling hgs was investigated for the leech lake aquifer saskatchewan canada the dynamic nature of the surface groundwater fluxes are complex with interchangeable flow dynamics a fully coupled numerical model to describe the surface groundwater fluxes has yet to be developed for the area the development of the numerical model is an important tool for decision making and sustainable management of the limited groundwater resource assessment and evaluation of the climatic variabilities have been incorporated into the model simulation scenarios different pumping and recharge scenarios were evaluated ranging from short term 1 year to long term 100 years plan for the sustainable management of groundwater system of the leech lake aquifer in addition this study explores the magnitude temporal variability and spatial distribution of exchange flow rates between the aquifer and its interconnected lakes simulation results provide evidence of substantial exchange flux and their vital role in water balance and groundwater recharge over the modeling catchment simplified assumptions of homogeneous hydraulic conductivity throughout the aquitard and aquifer could be ascertained as one of the limitations of this developed model configuration inclusion of local scale heterogeneities in the existing soil might improve results of the simulations for this reason interconnectivity with other distant aquifers has been assumed as negligible in this modeling process the beneficial outcome of the investigation provides an initial step in establishing a regional groundwater model to gain a better understanding of the interconnectivity and flow dynamics between the adjoining aquifer systems the numerical model provides an important tool for decision makers in the management of the regional groundwater resources in the area for example a large scale modeling of all the aquifers in yorkton region within a single modeling framework can be proposed as the future work the application of this fully integrated model with inclusion of interconnections from nearby aquifers would be very beneficial in understanding the whole picture the tools and the various scenarios from this study highlights the importance in the development of the conceptual understanding in the role of groundwater surface water interaction in such integrated systems the simulation results also offered insight to transient dynamics of water fluxes through lake beds which is critical to ensure the sustainable management of this aquifer system hence groundwater storage might be one of the significant components which could readily be exploitable to alleviate potential reductions of water availability this study validates the capacity of the fully integrated models to reproduce the essential dynamics of gw sw exchange processes in summary this study confirmed that the reliability of this developed model based estimates in terms of identifying magnitude and spatial variability of groundwater influx for this modeling region the study can serve as a critical case investigation to understand the groundwater and surface interactions in the canadian prairies especially in semi arid

8211,study region leech lake aquifer city of yorkton saskatchewan canadian prairies study focus groundwater and surface water interactions have been conducted numerically for bringing out a sustainable management of the leech lake aquifer in the southern portion of city of yorkton area within the province of saskatchewan canada the aquifer is composed of highly conductive sediments over bedrock strata with low hydraulic conductivity a fully coupled physically based surface groundwater flow model using hydrogeosphere hgs is developed for the purpose of simulation in this numerical model different withdrawal scenarios and the effects of climate variabilities precipitation and snowmelt are being conducted to investigate the impact of water usage on groundwater level new hydrological insights for the region groundwater from several aquifers serves as the main water supply for the city of yorkton aquifer protection and sustainable use of the limited resource is of utmost importance to the municipality and in support of economic development in the region insight and understanding of the risks and impact to the municipal groundwater supply is required to address the sustainability of the aquifers in the area a numerical model was developed to provide greater comprehension of the surface and groundwater fluxes model calibration and validation was completed with existing long term monitoring information from piezometers in the area in the semi arid environment of the prairie provinces water withdrawal and precipitation plays a significant role in affecting groundwater level different withdrawal scenarios are conducted to investigate the impact of the water usage on the leech lake aquifer that will provide a tool to support the development of a sustainable management plan precipitation as well as snowmelt have been incorporated into the model to identify the driving recharge factor for groundwater variation temporal and spatial variabilities as well as estimation of magnitude for exchange flow rates at the interfaces are presented the fully integrated model developed in this study provides the foundation for future groundwater management applications in climate driven changes within the prairie environment keywords fully coupled model surface ground water interactions groundwater flux precipitation snowmelt 1 introduction the understanding of watershed hydrology including both groundwater and surface water gw sw is crucial for sustainable water management the interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies i e rivers lakes streams wetlands are an important feature of hydrological cycle however in the past this interaction has been considered independently winter et al 1999 and overlooked in many cases particularly in semi arid regions fleckenstein et al 2010 hydrologic modeling is a strategic technique to the understanding of the gw sw interactions jolly et al 2010 mare et al 2007 rassam et al 2012 currently it is gaining prominence in the understanding of the complex interaction flux that is incorporated into hydrological numerical simulations as shown in some of the comprehensive reviews brunner et al 2009 sophocleous 2000 unland et al 2013 however uncertainties still exist in interaction modeling arnold et al 2012 muñoz carpena et al 2006 reckhow 2003 these uncertainties could arise from different aspects such as the presence of structural controls channel networks tanner and hughes 2015 in an interconnected hydrological system groundwater discharge may play an important role on total flow to surface water bodies and vice versa groundwater withdrawal by means of pumping can be considered as one of the critical issues under this context which largely impacts the groundwater and surface water balance alley 2007 feinstein and reeves 2010 zhou 2009 surface water especially in dry seasons can also be largely affected by groundwater withdrawal and thereby induces considerable fluctuations on the level of the water table sanz et al 2011 the gw sw interactions could be impacted by human activities such as agriculture urbanization etc geological topographical and climatic factors of the study region have a major impact on the gw sw interactions process haria et al 2013 ivkovic 2009 the combined effect of topography geology and climate is a prerequisite in investigating the interactions the interactions could be significantly different from one area to another area especially in the prairie environment due to its highly diversified geology and climate large variation in aquifer categories varying recharge and groundwater flow circumstances as well as a large array of river flow surroundings alley et al 1999 for instance the groundwater resources in eastern canada are heavily dependent on precipitation and flow from the atlantic ocean chaillou et al 2016 whereas in western canada and the prairies this may not be the fact two basic techniques have been found in simulating gw sw interactions namely comprehensive and marginal models comprehensive models are physically based approach in which ground water and surface water models can be coupled and thereby simulated gw sw interaction in terms of hydraulic head and hydraulic connectivity however insufficient data on geology aquifer characteristics could result in numerical convergence difficulties in this physically based approach reilly and harbaugh 2004 woods et al 2003 on the other hand marginal models can simulate the degree of sw gw interaction through water transfer between diverse conceptual layers which is not data intensive combined with lower computation resources in this approach model verification could be complicated due to the absence of a representation of the water table consideration of flow among different catchments is essential when applying such systems barthel and banzhaf 2016 furman 2008 great lakes science advisory board 2018 fully coupled schemes have been used as physics based models to integrate saturated zone unsaturated zone and surface waters the modified richards equation has been well used as the governing equation for groundwater flows to consider both saturated and unsaturated zones in one framework for surface water the depth averaged saint venant equation has been mostly used governing equations including both surface and groundwater flow are resolved concurrently in fully coupled scheme brunner and simmons 2012 loague et al 2006 only one calculating platform is needed which could significantly reduce computing efforts fully coupled scheme is mostly preferred to consider all hydrological processes in one catchment for gw sw interactions comparing to other methods such as loosely coupled scheme the interaction between surface water and groundwater is complicated due to the existence of many factors such as uncertainty of land cover and aquifer properties which can cause substantial errors in model output eslamian and nekoueineghad 2009 sophocleous 2010 straatsma et al 2013 a fully integrated physically based numerical model is well capable of handling these factors alaghmand et al 2014 hydrogeosphere hgs fully integrated model has been selected for this research because of its capability to address some of these complexities while considering a large scale study therrien 2011 hydrogeosphere can simulate the dynamic interactions between all sub domains at each time step although there exist several numerical schemes e g finite difference and finite volume methods el amin et al 2011 salama et al 2014 sun et al 2012 hgs discretizes the governing differential equations using implicit galerkin finite element method in hgs rainfall precipitation is branched into components such as evapotranspiration runoff and infiltration hgs allows for the computation of water infiltration or exfiltration between rivers lakes and aquifers these interactions play a significant role in the prediction of future scenarios with respect to climate change since recharge precipitation snowmelt is very susceptible to climatic fluctuations the integrated hydrological model simulates flow in the subsurface and surface domains by considering numerous hydrological variables such as hydraulic head or surface water depth groundwater head and fluid exchange between compartments these parameters are calculated simultaneously at each time step relationship of relative permeability and saturation have been established using van genuchten 1980 or brooks and corey 1964 relationships on the other hand the two dimensional depth averaged flow is normally used for surface water modeling as one of the fully coupled models hgs has been well applied in the past with its capacities and wide application for different geometric configurations integration of surface flow groundwater flow and evapotranspiration competence of hgs is critical to generate a better representation of recharge mechanism which has been approved in the geer basin region goderniaux et al 2009 it is also found that four parameters hydraulic conductivity porosity the van genuchten parameter and the channel manning coefficient can have a large impact on simulation results an et al 2018 van genuchten 1980 additionally hgs has been utilized at the regional scales such as the san joaquin valley however to date very limited research can be found on the application of hgs in the prairies of semi arid regions to fill in this gap the present research is conducted to investigate the gw sw interaction around the leech lake on a regional scale in saskatchewan canada the hgs model is calibrated and validated using the field data water withdrawal scenarios have been completed to provide potential outcomes from over use and to inform groundwater management decisions this main body of the article is divided primarily into two sections 1 methodology and 2 results and analysis where the methodology section of this paper represents the study site leech lake aquifer information governing equations of hgs model and the numerical model set up discretization details and boundary conditions assigned the result and analysis section demonstrates the model calibration and validation as well as scenario analysis for the management of the leech lake aquifer finally concluding remarks regarding the findings of the study in the context of sustainability issues have been stated 2 methodology 2 1 study site the city of yorkton is located in southeastern saskatchewan which is solely dependent on groundwater for its main water supply fig 1 groundwater has played a vital role in the city of yorkton s municipal water supply over the last century the groundwater supply is originates from fourteen production wells expanding over five well fields with an average withdrawal rate ranging from 2000 000 3 000 000 m3 year the average annual precipitation in the region is around 435 mm year from 1910 to 2014 environment canada a minimum rainfall of 237 mm year in 2001 up to a maximum of 734 mm year in 1957 has been noted maathuis et al 2006 the yorkton region encompasses townships t 23 26 ranges r 2 6 west of the second meridian the study area for this investigation includes townships 24 26 ranges 3 4 west of the second meridian as shown in fig 2 the topography of this review region varies from 520 m above sea level m asl in the southwest to 480 m asl north of the city of yorkton the formation of leech lake aquifer is primarily based on sands and gravels and this aquifer lies in townships 23 24 and the southern part of township 25 range 4 w2m as shown in fig 2 this aquifer comprises two hydraulically attached aquifer units leech lake aquifer and the otthon aquifer maathuis and simpson 2006 the northern section of the leech lake aquifer is an intertill aquifer of 10 m 20 m thick that is comprised of interglacial sands and gravels the western section is hydraulically connected with the otthon aquifer which is overlain by 5 10 m thick aquitard characterized as till whereas the eastern part is overlain by 10 20 m thick aquitard maathuis and simpson 2006 water security agency 2015 aquifers in the yorkton area are extremely heterogeneous transmissivity values of many aquifers fluctuate by one order of magnitude in this region aquifer transmissivity of leech lake is between 3 7 102 m2 d min to 3 5 103 m2 d max maathuis and simpson 2006 water security agency 2015 leech lake and crescent lakes are the main surface waterbodies within the study area fig 3 leech lake is a confined aquifer that has the capacity to produce up to 1 000 000 m3 year the recharge rate of an aquifer is governed largely on the thickness type of the overlying aquitard or soil hayashi et al 2016 van der kamp and hayashi 2009 for the leech lake aquifer system the overlying clay till aquitard is relatively thick approximately 20 60 m with a thick overlying till aquifer the average recharge is expected to be in the range of 3 5 over the leech lake aquifer systems maathuis and simpson 2006 water security agency 2015 hydrographs of production and monitoring wells showed that the long term groundwater levels of leech lake aquifers were not being affected by groundwater withdrawals moderately low drawdowns with the combination of high pumping rates highlights the nature of relatively high hydraulic conductivity of this aquifer system for this reason recovery of water levels had been detected in the past for the leech lake aquifer just within several days upon the cessation of pumping water security agency 2015 the general information and input parameters used in the leech lake aquifer zone are summarized in table 1 the observation well and production well location are shown in fig 3 hydraulic conductivity of till layers could be increased by at least two orders of magnitude due to the existence of fractured till in the upper 8 m this phenomenon leads to the possibility of higher recharge to the underlying aquifer van der kamp and hayashi 1998 the south well field is located at the top of a topographic ridge which ranges from northwest to southeast of yorkton making it challenging to assume groundwater flow direction with limited hydraulic head information from the observation wells however it was identified that the groundwater flow is flowing towards the production wells based on the instantaneous water level assessment maathuis and simpson 2006 the average yearly withdrawal from the leech lake well field wells 8 and 9 was 819 000 m3 between 1970 and 2004 a total volume of approximately 28 670 000 m3 was extracted from this well field until till 2004 most importantly the south wellfield contributes approximately 41 of the total water supply to the cityt of yorkton from 1983 to 2002 however withdrawal volumes from this wellfield was reduced to 13 in 2013 water security agency 2015 records of historical withdrawal from the leech lake aquifer for three the different time frames can be found in table 2 2 2 governing equations the geospatial data i e dem soil and land usage and climate data i e precipitation snow evapotranspiration are required for the hgs modeling model simulation could be based on the spatial resolutions of dem and climate data beeson et al 2014 chaubey et al 2005 cotter et al 2003 dixon and earls 2009 as a physically based fully coupled model the following equations are used in hgs including mass conservation for both subsurface and surface water domains and auxiliary equations for

domains are spatially discretized into triangular grids the 2 d mesh comprising of 3 node elements was constructed using gridbuilder shown in fig 4 the triangular 2 d grid mesh of surface water domain was refined as that of the whole domain which is necessary for the surface and groundwater interaction at every segment of the prescribed area this 2 d mesh was draped over the 3 d subsurface mesh fig 4a consisting of 6 node elements as illustrated in fig 4 b so that the geometry and the top most nodes in the 3 d properly match with the 2 d mesh the elevation for the bottom bedrock layer and middle interface layer i e between aquifer and aquitard nodes were generated using surfer 16 for the surface layer elevation geospatial canada data was used with the most updated digital elevation model dem and digital surface model dsm this fully integrated approach permits water input as rainfall and snowmelt to be partitioned into different components surface or overland flow evaporation infiltration to unsaturated soil or directly to gw in a physically based fashion the leech lake aquifer subsurface model section is represented by 10 uniformly distributed sublayers consisting of 6 node triangular prismatic elements to reduce long computational time with better representation of the subsurface domain fig 4b of the 10 layers the upper six layers situated just below ground surface are considered as an aquitard covered by sandy clay or silty clay materials on the other hand the remaining bottom four layers are considered as an aquifer which is occupied with sand from the top to the bottom of the subsurface domain in the subsurface domain a total of 32 370 nodes and 56 664 elements enclosed the simulation domain out of the 56 664 elements the deepest 18 888 elements represent the sandy aquifer with an average hydraulic conductivity of 1 05 10 3 m s water security agency 2015 the remaining upper 37 776 elements represent the aquitard layer with an average hydraulic conductivity of 3 03 10 9 m s as determined during the calibration phase the output of the hgs simulation reports saturation hydraulic head and exchange fluxes surface water depth velocity field and other variables bedrock elevation as well as the middle layer distinguishing aquitard and aquifer interface have been established using surfer 16 from the value of different cross sectional log index obtained from src report maathuis and simpson 2006 in the surface domain hydrogeosphere hgs illustrates 2 d surface flow with the help of the solution from the diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equations the extent of the lateral boundaries of the surface zone coincides with those at the top of the subsurface domain furthermore the mesh of the surface domain coincides with the mesh at the top surface of the porous medium domain thereby the surface water elevation can be explained as the hydraulic head value of the topmost subsurface mesh node the surface flow domain has been included primarily for simulating overland flow over the domain interaction with the subsurface is incorporated via coupling terms as manifested in eqs 1 and 3 surface flow domain consists of one overland flow zone where 6296 elements and 3237 nodes have been selected initial water level has been fixed through a trial and error procedure by adjusting the withdrawal and recharge precipitation in this case rates after obtaining desired initial water level the simulation was executed for a particular timeframe without any interference of withdrawal and recharge so that modeling system could get enough time to stabilize due to previous changes fig 5 shows contours of elevation and water depth both in meters at the finishing time of the transient phase 14 years in the model domain both the leech lake aquifer for the subsurface portion and leech lake and crescent lakes for the surface domain have been considered other aquifers streams or lakes are not considered since no significant impact on the leech lake aquifer can be found from previous studies nor from the field data therefore no flow boundary conditions were applied along the perimeter of both porous media and surface domain the entire model domain is considered as a closed reservoir system additionally a critical depth boundary condition is imposed on the topmost surface layer this setting serves as an outlet to drain extra surface water to avoid ponding this critical depth boundary condition pushes the water elevation at the boundary to be approximately equal to the critical depth which reduces the energy of flowing water in comparison to the stream bottom goderniaux et al 2009 therrien et al 2010 however values of water fluxes are not presumed to a time step rather than being computed during the simulation by this fully coupled integrated model this calculation is based on the hydraulic head difference between the associated surface and subsurface domains along with the multiplication of a leakage factor this factor is inversely proportional to coupling length lc l defining the properties of the underlying soil goderniaux et al 2009 and have been prescribed explicitly in the governing flow equations the precipitation snowmelt data and pumping rates are used as specified hydrological fluxes in the leech lake aquifer catchment historical precipitation and temperature data were obtained from environment canada weather stations near the city of yorkton from 1945 to 2019 an average precipitation data of 435 mm year was applied initially for spinning up the model and thereby reaching into the initial state for both surface and subsurface systems water security agency 2015 the snowmelt data are obtained from the yorkton rcmp snow station data from these weather stations are incorporated as daily input and applied as specified fluxes on the surface layer groundwater abstraction rates from well 8 and well 9 are utilized on a monthly basis from january 2002 to december 2015 water security agency 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation assumption of boundary conditions initial head and aquifer properties can be mentioned as the largest uncertainty of the model however it would be impossible to create any numerical model without making any assumptions or simplifications sensitivity analysis is then required to quantify the uncertainty in the calibrated model caused by estimated hydraulic parameters and or boundary conditions it also helps in identifying the parameters that influence the model results during a sensitivity analysis exercise variation of calibrated values of hydraulic parameters have been executed by changing one parameter at a time and the model s response is being observed and compared with available measurements from this analysis it has been found that hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard layer is the most sensitive parameter due to the lack of the hydraulic conductivity measurements overlying aquitard in the leech lake aquifer region different values of hydraulic conductivity have been tested and compared to the measured values manual calibration were conducted within the specified pumping period jan 2002 to dec 2015 using water level data from existing wells completed in the leech lake aquifer data from four monitoring wells operated by wsa 99 01 99 02 99 03 and 99 04 were used in the calibration procedure wsa operated wells were used in the calibration exercise because of their location adjacent to main production wells and the availability of measured hydraulic head data for the specified time interval based on the water levels from both observed and simulation results it appears the water levels from wells 99 01 99 02 and 99 03 have been affected by production the highest drawdowns 1 5 m occurred in 99 01 in 2009 and 2010 and the lowest drawdowns up to 0 5 m were observed in 99 03 due to distant location of 99 04 observation well from the main production wells fluctuations of groundwater level were minimal from the calibration phase based on this analysis it could be stated that the effects of withdrawals on the leech lake aquifer could spread up to 3 km to the west of the production wells however effects of pumping to the east of the production wells could not be identified due to the deficiency of monitoring locations typical hydrogeological characteristics of aquitards are usually heterogeneous and inconsistent aquitards are also usually non uniform in thickness hydraulic measurements are extremely difficult to collect within aquitards in the study site to obtain a reliable perception of aquitard characteristics investigation of water level data from overlying and underlying aquifers were taken from previous investigations bradbury 1985 cherry et al 2004 kellner 2007 the influence of the accumulated sediment at the bed of the two existing primary lakes crescent and leech has been determined by using different hydraulic conductivity values the bottom sediment layer has a tight soil clay or a relatively less impermeable soil silty clay it is important to examine its influence of the bottom layers therefore several simulation runs have been performed however no significant effect can be noted using lower hydraulic conductivity values hence in the present simulation a constant value of 3 03 10 9 m s for hydraulic conductivity is used for the entire aquitard region the calibration results are shown in fig 6 with good agreement between simulation and measured results additionally quantitative sensitivity analysis is conducted and listed

model validation was completed to compare the simulation results for the other two monitoring wells src 99 02 and src 99 03 with the same withdrawal rate precipitation and snowmelt conditions and timeframe the results for src 99 02 can be seen in figs 8 and 9 and table 4 a good agreement with measurement in this well is noted from the calibration and validation the model is capable of simulating groundwater heads to reproduce the gw sw exchange fluxes in the leech lake aquifer various variables were applied to the model to predict the impact of climate and withdrawal conditions affecting the groundwater levels 3 2 scenario analysis the following scenarios are proposed to investigate the groundwater withdrawal and climatic conditions affecting the groundwater level table 5 lists the details and rationale of each scenario completed for the study 3 2 1 100 year withdrawal scenario a hypothetical scenario of excessive withdrawal under extreme drought condition within 100 year period is proposed in determining the rate of withdrawal that will result in the depletion of the aquifer five production wells were incorporated into the model over a 100 year period neither recharge from precipitation nor snowmelt is incorporated in this specific scenario the regional surface topography of area shows that the southern portion of the aquifer is higher than the northern and middle regions therefore the pumping rate is set with higher values from the production well located in the southern portion of the model domain as compared to the other four withdrawal wells different withdrawal rates of the five production wells were applied to identify the evacuation stage the model results show that the optimal withdrawal rate of 6 622 000 m3 year from the southern well and 4 415 000 m3 year from the other four wells for 100 years could deplete the aquifer as shown in fig 10 fig 11 a b show the saturation contour map of the model domain from the beginning to the end of the simulation respectively the estimation of the exchange flow rates between the ground and surface is critical to evaluate the effect of withdrawal scenarios on water level in the lakes the vertical exchange flow rate between the gw sw interface can be calculated as 8 q v a q j d a where q v is the magnitude of the volume flow rate along the vertical direction q is the exchange flux vector at the interface and j is the unit vector in the vertical direction exchange flow rates have been recorded during the simulation of this evacuation scenario the exchange flow rate and water depth at the interface between crescent lake and the underlying subsurface is shown in fig 12 the seepage flow rate from the lake to the water table increases significantly at the beginning of the withdrawal scenario and subsequently decreases to zero the sharp increase is a direct consequence of the change in hydraulic head as the lake is fully saturated with the decrease in the saturation of the lake the exchange flow rate decreases correspondingly with further decrease in saturation there would be no exchange between the surface and groundwater the water depth also drops from 0 8 m to 0 m corresponding to the variation of the exchange flow rate it noteworthy that the exchange is a complex process and depends on the topology of the lake surface the exchange flow rate approaches 0 after 13 years which indicates that no significant amount of water remain in the lake that may contribute to the underlying subsurface portion of that region to obtain an understanding of the exchange flux for the remainder of the model domain excluding crescent lake the magnitude and trend of the exchange flow rate is illustrated in fig 13 the exchange flux is similar to crescent lake however the depletion of the aquifer took a longer period of approximately 45 years the extended period is attributed to the larger study area and the variability of the porous material as opposed to evaluating the flux of crescent lake 3 2 2 aquifer yield scenarios to investigate the sustainability of the leech lake aquifer the aquifer yield under different pumping stresses from two production wells well 08 and 09 and four observation wells 99 01 99 02 99 03 and 99 04 are simulated in total 1 year 5 years 10 years 20 years 50 years and 100 years are simulated to identify the optimal withdrawal rate in ensuring sustainable use of the groundwater resource the following assumptions are made in this scenario analysis the available head for the two wells is assumed to be 17 m table 6 this value represents the available head in well 09 which is considered as a conservative approach as it is the lowest value in the entire domain the top of the aquifer is represented as the middle layer as mentioned in the previous section equal pumping rates are used for both wells table 7 and fig 14 shows the calculation of total withdrawals to ensure sustainable drawdown level for different time frames the cumulative volume was determined by applying the total pumping rate multiplied by the duration of withdraws the most critical and sensitive region in this regard is the location where the water level would be affected most due to pumping of water in comparison to the other observation wells for this reason the sustainable level is assumed as the level of the aquifer top elevation 492 5 m at the production site the simulation is conducted in transient mode with fluctuating pumping rates under each time frame until the drawdown in the pumping wells approached 17 m table 7 however higher withdrawal rate could be possible for shorter time span in transient scenarios for example water from the leech lake aquifer could be pumped at rates of 8 200 000 m3 year for up to five years to maintain the sustainable level as shown in table 7 the water level becomes unsustainable after approximately 11 years and the water levels would have dropped below aquifer s top at the production site the transient scenarios also reveal that the aquifer can be pumped at rate as high as 12 616 000 m3 for up to one 1 year however pumping at such excessively high rates may result in higher than anticipated drawdowns in the pumping wells due to well losses withdrawal rate should be decreased if the aquifer needs to be pumped for longer period cumulatively more water can be extracted if the aquifer is pumped at lower pumping rates but for longer periods overall for transient stage drawdowns at the observation wells had been examined for longer pumping time as depicted in table 7 3 2 3 impact of climate variabilities on groundwater climate change plays a significant role in affecting groundwater intense climate extremes such as droughts and floods are expected to increase climatic variabilities will likely have an impact on the rate of recharge resulting on the availability of groundwater to support municipal use precipitation and snowmelt are considered as the largest variables affecting recharge in the study area the canadian prairies receives less than 500 mm per year of precipitation burn et al 2008 dumanski et al 2015 more than 80 of the streamflow occurs as snowmelt over frozen soils even though snowfall accounts for one third of the total precipitation only gray and landine 1988 modeling of different water balance elements is uncertain and complicated one major uncertainty in the simulation is the identification of precipitation and snowmelt weight in the simulation dawes et al 2012 tanner and hughes 2015 in the present study both precipitation and snowmelt are incorporated in the model simulations to determine the driving recharge factor and its influence on the surrounding region for ensuring sustainability and feasible management of the leech lake aquifer fig 15 illustrates the historical precipitation and snowmelt amounts collected from two different weather stations for the entire simulation period 2002 2015 the data are presented where snowmelt recharges are showing peak values but occurring for a shorter period over the years on the other hand precipitation values are not showing as many peak values but it occurs throughout the year however it is difficult to identify the primary recharge contributor either rainfall or snowmelt in this study region from this point of view two separate simulations in the presence of withdrawals one for the precipitation alone and the other for the snowmelt only have been conducted these two simulations have been compared with the observation data from 99 01 99 02 and 99 03 monitoring wells the data for observation well 99 01 is illustrated in fig 16 it is evident that the simulation with only precipitation has a better agreement with the field data as compared to the simulation only with snowmelt both simulation results show similar trend or pattern in the modeling domain the withdrawal from the existing production wells 08 and 09 are much higher than both the precipitation and snowmelt this suggests the shape and trends of the simulation are mainly dominated by the withdrawal rates negligible influences of the precipitation and snowmelt have been found in changing the pattern of simulation graphs however these recharge variabilities precipitation snowmelt only serve as a factor in shifting the simulation graphs from a lower level to higher level of groundwater heads 4 conclusions groundwater surface water and its associated aquatic ecosystems are considered as an integrated entity under one water resources management unit for this reason water resources management is experiencing a major paradigm shift controlling and predictive measures of designing systems are being upgraded frequently by the technical experts for the establishment of better and adaptive management practices to address the complexities of social ecological systems from this perspective a robust methodology using a fully integrated ground and surface water modeling hgs was investigated for the leech lake aquifer saskatchewan canada the dynamic nature of the surface groundwater fluxes are complex with interchangeable flow dynamics a fully coupled numerical model to describe the surface groundwater fluxes has yet to be developed for the area the development of the numerical model is an important tool for decision making and sustainable management of the limited groundwater resource assessment and evaluation of the climatic variabilities have been incorporated into the model simulation scenarios different pumping and recharge scenarios were evaluated ranging from short term 1 year to long term 100 years plan for the sustainable management of groundwater system of the leech lake aquifer in addition this study explores the magnitude temporal variability and spatial distribution of exchange flow rates between the aquifer and its interconnected lakes simulation results provide evidence of substantial exchange flux and their vital role in water balance and groundwater recharge over the modeling catchment simplified assumptions of homogeneous hydraulic conductivity throughout the aquitard and aquifer could be ascertained as one of the limitations of this developed model configuration inclusion of local scale heterogeneities in the existing soil might improve results of the simulations for this reason interconnectivity with other distant aquifers has been assumed as negligible in this modeling process the beneficial outcome of the investigation provides an initial step in establishing a regional groundwater model to gain a better understanding of the interconnectivity and flow dynamics between the adjoining aquifer systems the numerical model provides an important tool for decision makers in the management of the regional groundwater resources in the area for example a large scale modeling of all the aquifers in yorkton region within a single modeling framework can be proposed as the future work the application of this fully integrated model with inclusion of interconnections from nearby aquifers would be very beneficial in understanding the whole picture the tools and the various scenarios from this study highlights the importance in the development of the conceptual understanding in the role of groundwater surface water interaction in such integrated systems the simulation results also offered insight to transient dynamics of water fluxes through lake beds which is critical to ensure the sustainable management of this aquifer system hence groundwater storage might be one of the significant components which could readily be exploitable to alleviate potential reductions of water availability this study validates the capacity of the fully integrated models to reproduce the essential dynamics of gw sw exchange processes in summary this study confirmed that the reliability of this developed model based estimates in terms of identifying magnitude and spatial variability of groundwater influx for this modeling region the study can serve as a critical case investigation to understand the groundwater and surface interactions in the canadian prairies especially in semi arid

trend in runoff but the magnitudes of increase vary spatially and temporally hu and jiao 2015 constructed a groundwater flow model in the qaidam basin northern tibetan plateau via data derived from grace gravity recovery and climate experiment but this approach is not applicable in the lrb as the spatial resolution is too low groundwater studies in the lrb are limited and the groundwater flow changes in response to climate warming remain unknown in such an alpine area numerical modeling is an effective tool to investigate the groundwater flow patterns characterize groundwater recharge and

peng 2010 there are four hydrological stations in the lrb governing four sub basins respectively fig 1c pangdo tangga and lhasa stations are located in sequence along the mainstream of the lhasa river and the yangbajing station is situated in a tributary joining the lhasa river downstream the lhasa city peng and du 2010 qiu et al 2014 the spatial and temporal distributions of climate factors in the lrb are nonuniform during the year annual mean air temperature of the lrb is 7 7 c and annual mean precipitation is 437 8 mm fig 1b both gradually decreasing from south to north liu et al 2019 the hottest and wettest months are june to august because of the monsoon storms occurring from april to october prasch 2010 liu et al 2019 according to the meteorological features may to october can be regarded as the summer hot season and november to april in the next year as winter dry season bookhagen and burbank 2010 most of the rainfall is distributed in the summer hot season accounting for approximately 95 of the annual precipitation shi et al 2014 the total glacierized area in the lrb is 656 km2 accounting for 2 of the total area of the lrb table 1 including discontinuous glaciers in the upper lhasa river and continuous glaciers in the northwestern mountain ranges liu 1999 prasch 2010 glaciers are mainly found in high elevation 4000 m areas especially the northwestern watershed

water body urban and unused land about 60 of the lrb is covered by grassland with an area of 20 010 km2 fig 2 the second largest land use type is unused land covering 30 of the total area and the rest land use types take up 10 2 2 data the 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem was utilized to define surface topography and extract the catchment boundaries of the lrb geological map of the lrb is from tibet geological survey 1979 the monthly data of precipitation and evaporation within the lrb during 1979 2000 were obtained from the china meteorological information center http data cma cn monthly runoff data at pangdo tangga lhasa and yangbajing stations during 1979 2000 were collected from institute of tibetan plateau research runoff data during 2003 2014 were obtained from huang et al 2020 the water table data were obtained from pumping wells in the downtown lhasa city which are multi year average data during 1979 2000 distributions of glacier and permafrost were obtained from the second glacier inventory data set of china zou et al 2017 the land use and land cover data were obtained from national tibetan plateau data center liu 2019 the future

concentration pathways rcps o neill et al 2016 more details about the four climate change scenarios were provided in the supplementary material 2 3 baseflow separation as lrb is vast and only limited water table monitoring data are available baseflow is an important indicator to calibrate the groundwater flow model previous studies show that baseflow is the main constrain to calibrate a groundwater flow model okello et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 although there are many baseflow separation methods in the literature e g price 2011 yang et al 2019 the methods are not verified in the lrb because of the complicated hydrological processes the constructed model simply assumed the winter dry season streamflow as baseflow when precipitation is limited and snowmelt water is rare walvoord et al 2012 similar studies also used the winter season streamflow as baseflow singh and jain 2003 tongal et al 2013 according to the calculation results the baseflow of lhasa river accounts for 26 3 of the runoff which is similar to the result 28 of isotope and chemistry baseflow separation method liu 1999 2 4 hydrogeological parameters hydrogeology of the lrb was simplified from the geological map of the tibet scale 1 1 000 000 geological profiles stratigraphic profiles and hydrogeological map of each model layer were obtained from the geological map and integrated into the groundwater flow model fig 1c hydrogeology of the region can be simplified into four units the alluvial sequence quaternary volcanic and mélange clastic sequences upper mesozoic to paleogene granite intrusion upper mesozoic to paleogene and terrigenous sequence paleozoic to mesozoic figs s1 and s2 hydraulic conductivity of the units was initially estimated from empirical values that are reported in previous studies ge et al 2008 gleeson et al 2011 and slightly modified during model calibration table 2 decrease of hydraulic conductivity with depth was included in the model and the depth dependent hydraulic conductivity is described by the integrated model kuang and jiao 2014 1 log k log k r log k s log k r 1 z β where k r is the residual permeability log k r is suggested to be 25 4 m2 for earth s continental crust in general k s is the surface permeability β is the decay index and z is the depth below ground surface this model provides improved fit to the measured permeability data and can be used to describe the permeability depth relationship through the entire earth s crust kuang and jiao 2014 the permeability can be transformed to hydraulic conductivity k by fetter 2001 2 k k ρ g μ where ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration and μ is the dynamic viscosity at 15 c other parameters including specific storage s s and specific yield s y are also listed in table 2 2 5 numerical model the three dimensional groundwater flow model was built based on the geological and land use maps of the lrb using the finite difference code modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 with the nwt solution niswonger et al 2011 the model was first built in steady state and then converted to transient state after calibration the steady state model represents a long term averaged condition and was used to figure out the groundwater flow pattern and water budget in the lrb the transient model aims to forecast the evolution of the groundwater flow system under different future climate change scenarios the model is 2 8 km thick in average and was discretized into 10 layers table s1 the thickness of the model layers ranges from 5 m of surface layer to 500 m of the deepest layer each layer s thickness increases exponentially with depth and layers under mountain areas are thickened while layers beneath valleys are thinned yao et al 2017 such model layer setup can improve the simulation accuracy of near surface active layer and ensure groundwater flow within 2 km depth can be modeled adequately ge et al 2008 there are 219 rows and 323 columns in each model layer and the model was discretized to 707 370 cells with 1 km 1 km resolution the lateral boundaries on the lrb s east west and north were specified as no flow conditions fig s3 the boundary type on the south is not clear because the basin topography is higher in the north and lower in the south and cross basin groundwater exchange may occur near the southern boundary as deep groundwater flow yao et al 2017 the southern lateral boundaries were set as a specified flux boundary and the groundwater exchange through this boundary can be changed in the model calibration fig s3 groundwater recharge was specified on the top layer of the model indicating the portion of rainfall or snowfall meltwater that infiltrates through the unsaturated zone and reach the water table infiltration coefficient of precipitation α i e ratio of groundwater recharge to precipitation is one of the main parameters controlling groundwater recharge rate in this model the parameter α depends on the topsoil texture which means land use of the lrb fig 2 is the main consideration when assigning α to the hydrological zones values of α in the model vary from 0 03 to 0 4 table 2 in consistence with the α values reported in a semiarid and arid area similar to the lrb scanlon et al 2006 groundwater seepage to river in the form of baseflow and evapotranspiration et are the main ways of discharge of the groundwater flow system drainage network was extracted from the hydrological analysis based on dem using qgis qgis development team 2020 and then discretized to the model grid river stage and bed elevation were also obtained from the dem the evapotraspiration package evt was used to simulate the transpiration effect of plants and direct evaporation that reduce the potential groundwater resources banta 2000 throughout the studied area the maximum evaporation rate and the extinction depth are respectively 13 7 mm yr and 4 mm yr shi et al 2014 at the southern boundary the yarlung zangbo riverbed collects the regional groundwater flow and was characterized via specified flux boundary conditions groundwater flow was assessed in the first four layers characterized by sediments with high conductivities glacier and permafrost distributions are important model inputs that can alter the groundwater recharge rate and hydraulic conductivity glaciations change the pressure overlying the aquifer and the ice melting rate during glacier receding or advancing affecting the recharge and discharge relationships between groundwater and surface water provost et al 2012 given that the glaciers are increasingly retreating due to climate warming yao et al 2012 glacier meltwater water is becoming a considerable resource in the lrb glacier s effect on groundwater can be regarded as a constant head boundary condition boulton et al 1995 bense and person 2008 cohen et al 2010 normani and sykes 2012 mackay et al 2020 or a constant flux boundary condition van weert et al 1997 breemer et al 2002 carlson et al 2007 somers et al 2019 in the model a constant flux boundary condition was assigned to the grids covered by glacier on the top layer and subsequently calibrated by the observed baseflow this approach has been proven to be reasonable in numerical groundwater flow models with glaciation van weert et al 1997 breemer et al 2002 carlson et al 2007 lemieux et al 2008 markovich et al 2016 glacier recharge rate was assigned 300 mm yr after calibration as a constant flux condition on the top layer where the glacier distributed roughly equal to the annual precipitation the glacier recharge rate was set as an initial estimation and then adjusted during the model calibration permafrost is generally a low permeability layer and treated as an aquitard by previous studies breemer et al 2002 van weert et al 1997 cheng and jin 2013 wang et al 2019 the cells located in permafrost area were assigned a hydraulic conductivity of 10 6 m d initially ge et al 2008 far lower than those of the aquifers cells within the seasonally frozen ground area were treated as normal grids kurylyk et al 2016 the thickness of permafrost layer is 4 30 m depending on the distance from the edge of the frozen ground feng 2015 2 6 transient model the steady state model was changed into a transient model to predict the evolution of the groundwater system in response to future climate change the model setting of the transient model is the same as that of the steady state model changes of precipitation from the cmip6 scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 ssp5 8 5 were used as input for the transient model specific storage and specific yield were also added to the transient model table 2 other parameters including hydraulic conductivity infiltration rate evapotranspiration and glacier recharge remain the same as those in the steady state model the transient model simulates the evolution of the groundwater flow system in the next 80 years 2020 2100 under the four future climate change scenarios 3 results 3 1 model calibration parameters including hydraulic conductivity k and infiltration coefficient of precipitation α were first assigned and then adjusted during model calibration parameters that give the best agreement between simulated and observed data after calibration are listed in table 2 calibration followed the trial and error method supported by the baseflow and water table observation data both the observed baseflow and water table measurements come from the winter dry period i e from november to april in the next year to evaluate the performance of the groundwater flow model the absolute error ae relative error re and the fit nrmse yao et al 2017 was used supplementary material fig 3 a shows the comparison between simulated and observed baseflow of the four sub basins in the lrb for the steady state model the re values vary from 1 7 to 6 6 and the fit nrmse coefficient is 0 96 the simulated baseflow agrees well with the observed values fig 3b presents a comparison of the simulated and observed water tables multi year average during 1979 2000 for the steady state model the ae values ranges from 2 84 to 8 08 with a mean of 3 67 the fit nrmse coefficient is 0 80 all the observed water table data were obtained from pumping wells in the downtown lhasa city where the water table may be disturbed by pumping the resolution of the grid 1 km 1 km is greater than the influence radius 800 m of a extraction well wang and wang 2020 thus the computed water table should be higher than the observed water table values as can be seen in fig 3b most of the computed values are higher than the measured water tables which shows that the model should be reliable fig 3c presents a comparison of computed and observed baseflow during 2003 2014 at the lhasa hydrological station for the transient model the re values vary from 2 7 20 7 with an average of 10 8 and the fit nrmse coefficient is 0 74 overall the model calibration indicates that the model can provide reasonable and reliable results 3 2 groundwater flow pattern hydraulic head distribution in the lrb is mainly controlled by topography and the hydrogeological setting as the hydraulic head variations are subdued version of the surface elevation fig 4 a simulated hydraulic heads decrease from northeast to southwest in accordance with the topography such a hydraulic head distribution indicates a general northeast to southwest groundwater flow direction the highest hydraulic head of 5435 m is located in the nyenchen tanglha mountains in the western part of the basin while the lowest hydraulic head of 3586 m is observed at the outlet of the lrb these two points correspond to the highest and lowest elevations of the study area the mean hydraulic gradient in the lrb is 2 9 relatively high hydraulic gradients are located in the upper reaches of the basin the greatest hydraulic gradient is up to 16 in the mountain areas of eastern and western lrb near the divide hydraulic gradient in the central lrb becomes small as the slope decrease to 1 in this area in correspondence of the quaternary deposits characterized by relatively high hydraulic conductivities a typical profile from the glacierized area through the lhasa city showing the groundwater flow system is presented in fig 4b the groundwater flow system is relatively complicated with both local and regional flowlines variation of the infiltration coefficient of precipitation α depends on the different types of topsoils approximately 13 6 of precipitation 71 6 mm yr infiltrates into the saturated zone and become groundwater among which 93 4 discharges to streams as baseflow and 5 5 returns to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration 4 2 mm yr only 1 1 flows out through the southern boundary more than 80 of the groundwater flow is constrained within 0 0 3 km below ground surface recharge of glacier meltwater to groundwater is not a significant component the amount of groundwater recharge from glacier meltwater is 5 4 mm yr which is 7 1 of the total groundwater recharge for the yangbajing sub basin in which glaciers are extensively distributed and the glaciers are retreating massively due to global warming yao et al 2007 2004 the simulated glacier melting rate is 29 1 mm yr and accounting for 34 7 of the total groundwater recharge interactions between groundwater and surface water and the magnitude of exchange rates are shown in fig 5 a the positive value means water flow from river to groundwater and the negative value means groundwater to river discharge in most river reaches groundwater discharges into rivers as baseflow with a magnitude of 28 8 0 m3 d per meter relatively high discharge rates appear in the middle reaches of the lhasa river the river reaches with positive values indicate that the river water feed groundwater where water level in the rivers should be higher than that of groundwater the positive values are mostly distributed in the first order tributaries in the upper stream of the lhasa river with magnitude of 0 40 1 m3 d per meter a modpath analysis was carried out based on the modflow simulation results fig 5b a total of 4536 pathlines were described where groundwater flow terminated by discharging to rivers with particle tracking distances and tracking times the shortest tracking distance is 0 5 km and the longest is 43 6 km the particle tracking time ranges from 67 days to 753 482 years the area with dense pathlines such as the mid southern lrb and depressions located at mountain front on the western lrb gain more recharge from groundwater and the range of groundwater tracking time tends to be wider mountain areas in the pando sub basin especially if permafrost is present tend to have sparser and shorter pathlines indicating short refreshing periods in these places and young groundwater ages the particle tracking time is related to the tracking distance but there is not obvious functional relationship because of the various depth dependent hydraulic conductivity 10 6 101 m d as shown in fig 6 tracking time between 10 100 years account for 52 6 of the pathlines the tracking distances less than 10 km long account for 85 of the pathlines which means local circulation plays a predominant role in groundwater flow 3 3 parameter sensitivity analysis infiltration recharge hydraulic conductivity aquifer thickness and distance between surface water features are significant parameters for configuring water table haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 a sensitivity analysis was carried out characterizing the hydraulic conductivity k s ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity k h k v infiltration coefficient of precipitation α decay index β glacier recharge specific storage s s specific yield s y southern boundary discharge hydraulic conductivity of permafrost maximum evapotranspiration rate and extinction depth table s2 the two model output variables of baseflow and hydraulic head were used to quantify how the model change with the input variables results of sensitivity analysis show that α and k s affect the hydraulic head and baseflow the most table s2 the infiltration recharge and hydraulic conductivity are the main parameters during the model calibration in this model the infiltration recharge is mainly affected by the infiltration coefficient of precipitation α and the hydraulic conductivity is mainly affected by the decay index β in the permeability depth model thus the following sensitivity analysis is focused on the infiltration coefficient of precipitation α and the decay index β the infiltration coefficient of precipitation α was set to vary between 0 03 to 0 40 for different land use types table 2 in the sensitivity analysis α was changed 10 for each land use type at each time fig 7 a shows the differences of baseflow in the four hydrological stations and average water table of the lrb varying α as α increases both baseflow and mean water table increase linearly meanwhile the discharge percentage of baseflow and evapotranspiration are slightly increased and decreased with variation less than 5 respectively the discharge percentage of southern boundary discharge remains constantly at about 1 the decay index β controls the rate of decrease of permeability with depth kuang and jiao 2014 a sensitivity analysis on the decay index β was also conducted to evaluate its effect on groundwater flow kuang and jiao 2014 suggested that for earth s continental crust in general the decay index β is equal to 0 25 the decay index β was set to vary from 0 1 to 0 45 in the sensitivity analysis fig 7b as β increases permeability decreases faster with depth thus leads to steepened groudwater table and reduces groundwater flow velocity according to the darcy s law the baseflow discharge decreases with β but the evapotranspiration and southern boundary discharge increases with β fig 7b simulated hydraulic head distributions along the a aʹ profile as β increases are shown in fig 8 as β increases strata s permeability at great depths become smaller thus the vertical velocity of groundwater flow decreases and less groundwater flows into deep aquifers the decrease of strata s permeability will also lead to less groundwater discharge to the downstream areas and the groundwater flow system also tends to be simpler 3 4 groundwater flow system in the next 80 years 2020 2100 the groundwater flow system was simulated for the next 80 years 2020 2100 based on the future climate scenarios using the transient model the four climate change scenarios show different trends in annual air temperature during 2020 2100 fig s4 a combination of groundwater flow patterns in the four scenarios in four typical years 2020 2040 2060 2100 is shown in fig 9 hydraulic head in the whole basin is related to precipitation under the same future climate change scenario higher precipitation corresponds to higher hydraulic head in the basin the variations of the hydraulic heads in the high altitude areas also becomes more significant the rise of hydraulic head in mountainous areas upstream sectors and the nyenchen tanglha mountains is greater than that of the other areas indicating that changes in groundwater flow system in high mountain areas are greater than the other areas the results also imply that the groundwater flow system in high mountain areas is more sensitive to climate change fig 10 shows the variations of baseflow and hydraulic head under the four future climate change scenarios the period of 1998 2014 represents the past and 2020 2100 represents the future the past and future annual precipitation data were obtained from observation and the cmip6 climate change scenarios the baseflow and hydraulic head fluctuate with the variation of future annual precipitation the baseflow shows increase trends under the four climate change scenarios and the increase trends range from 0 07 to 0 21 m3 s per year table 3 the baseflow shows the greatest increasing trend in ssp5 8 5 and the smallest trend in ssp1 2 6 the mean hydraulic head also increases with the precipitation increment the greatest increase in hydraulic head is also in ssp5 8 5 as the smallest occurs within ssp1 2 6 the magnitude of variation in baseflow becomes greater after about 2035 which indicates that wet year will become wetter and dry year will become drier in the future fig 10 extremely high precipitation and corresponding high hydraulic head and baseflow will become more frequently than the past and the change of groundwater flow system will be intensified in the future 4 discussion 4 1 model uncertainties uncertainties analysis of the model is based on the sensitivity analysis results of the sensitivity analysis show that α is the most sensitive factors affecting baseflow in the lrb table s2 glacier recharge and surface hydraulic conductivity k s are also sensitive factors affecting the baseflow table s2 baseflow increase in the lrb is predictable in the future result from the climate warming surface hydraulic conductivity k s affects the hydraulic head the most and glacier recharge is the next in the transient model glacier and permafrost are constant inputs from the results of uncertainty analysis the hydraulic conductivity of permafrost has the smallest effect on both baseflow and hydraulic head among all the input values so ignoring the changes of permafrost has an almost null impact on the model however glacier recharge is the second significant factors affecting the groundwater flow model the largest uncertainty of the transient model comes from glacier recharge the glacier recharge rate in the transient model for prediction uses the historical value i e the glacier recharge rate averaged from 1979 2000 uncertainty of the transient model is mainly due to the difference in the glacier recharge rates between the past and the future according to the trend of temperature change in the lhasa river basin the annual warming rate from 1979 to 2000 is 0 053 year while the annual warming rate from 2003 to 2014 is 0 067 year with the maximum and minimum value of 1 3 year and 0 78 year respectively assuming that the trend of glacier melt and recharge is consistent with the trend of temperature the rate of glacier recharge varies by 26 4 leading to the uncertainty of about 141007 7 m3 d 2 1 in baseflow and 2 1 m 0 1 in hydraulic head even if the model is not very sensitive to some parameters their cumulative effect may be significant evapotranspiration in the model was assigned a uniform value constant extinct depth and constant maximum evapotranspiration rate over the whole lrb factors affecting groundwater evaporation such as land use type and vadose zone porosity were not fully taken into account in the model specific storage and specific yield were important parameters in the transient model but they were set as constants for each type of the aquifer material similar to hydraulic conductivity specific storage also decreases with depth kuang et al 2021 the decrease of specific storage with depth was not taken into account in the transient model the water table observation data used in the model calibration also have some uncertainties as the water table observation data were obtained from pumping wells the water table were affected by the groundwater withdrawal the observed water tables are lower than the natural values without groundwater withdrawal in addition the measured water table data are all located in the lhasa city because there is no well in the remaining portions of the study area the lack of water table observation data will also lead to some uncertainties of the model 4 2 limitations this study made the first attempt to construct a numerical groundwater flow model coupled with the effects of glacier and permafrost for the lrb due to the scarce groundwater literature in this alpine region and the not abundant observation data to calibrate the model there are some limitations in the current model first the transient model coupling future climate change was built based on the steady state model and the calibration of the transient model fit nrmse 0 74 is not good as the steady state model fit nrmse 0 96 the calibration targets come from annual baseflow separation and no baseflow time series are available for model calibration the model also cannot reflect the glacier and permafrost changes due to climate warming an accurate groundwater recharge rate from glaciers is yet to be clarified as the climate warming the influence of seasonal permafrost freeze thaw processes and the thaw of permafrost due to future climate warming are not considered in addition to the influence of precipitation there are many other factors such as evaporation temperature and radiation that will affect the groundwater flow system in the future climate change scenarios ignoring these factors will reduce the reliability of the prediction results of the model despite these limitations and uncertainties of the current model the results agree with observation data and provide preliminarily the interactions between groundwater and surface water the model also provides for the first time the patterns of the groundwater flow system and the response of the groundwater system to future climate change in the lrb 5 conclusions a three dimensional numerical groundwater flow model was built for the lrb accounting for precipitation evapotranspiration land use glacier and permafrost the model was calibrated by baseflow data during winter dry season and water table observed in pumping wells in the lhasa city reasonable agreement is achieved fit nrmse 0 96 between simulated and measured data response of the groundwater flow system to future climate change was also predicted based on different future climate changes scenarios results show that about 13 6 of precipitation infiltrates and becomes groundwater more than 80 of the groundwater flow within depth less than 0 3 km below the ground surface baseflow is the most important component of the model about 93 4 of the groundwater discharges to streams as baseflow 5 5 evaporates and 1 1 flow out through the southern boundary the overall recharge of glacier meltwater to groundwater is 10 of the total groundwater recharge across the lrb most groundwater flow within localized flow systems with tracking time less than 100 years and tracking distance shorter than 10 km the predicted baseflow and mean hydraulic head fluctuate with the variation of future annual precipitation in 2020 2100 both baseflow and mean hydraulic head increase with precipitation in the different future climate change scenarios the increasing trends in baseflow for the four scenarios range from 0 07 to 0 21 m3 s per year during 2020 2100 the baseflow variation will become greater in the future as wet year will become wetter and dry year will become drier groundwater flow pattern and interactions between groundwater and surface water are important to an improved water resources management and sustainable water usage in the lrb studies on groundwater in the lrb are becoming even more important due to climate warming groundwater flow model construction for such alpine areas with limited observation data and previous studies is still an unresolved issue this study makes the first attempt to build a groundwater flow model results of this study will help construct numerical groundwater flow models in

recharacterized the hydrological cycle thus redistributed the components of water recharge and discharge on the tibetan plateau yao et al 2004 bianduo et al 2009 therefore investigating the hydrological cycle under climate change is meaningful for better water resources sustainability and ecosystem health on the plateau langridge and daniels 2017 groundwater is an important component of the hydrological cycle serving as a water reservoir and providing considerable amount of water in both wet and dry seasons andermann et al 2012 water level drop has been found across the globe which

representative alpine catchment and a typical arid region on the tibetan plateau wu et al 2005 glacier meltwater has been shown to contribute 26 of annual runoff while groundwater contributes 28 of the annual runoff liu 1999 in the downstream reaches of the yarlung zangbo basin groundwater has been found to contribute approximately 27 of the total river discharge yao et al 2021 during the past two decades there is a significant increase in runoff in the lhasa river lin et al 2008 reflecting the hydrological changes due to climate change liu et al 2015 coupled the vic variable infiltration

climate change on hydrological components such as evaporation soil moisture and runoff and extrapolated these variations to the next 50 years in the lrb qiu et al 2014 found that snowmelt water contributed 3 6 to the total runoff in the lrb when the snowmelt runoff model was employed based on the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data the simulations show an increasing trend in runoff but the magnitudes of increase vary spatially and temporally hu and jiao 2015 constructed a groundwater flow model in the qaidam basin northern tibetan plateau via data derived from grace gravity recovery and climate experiment but this approach is not applicable in the lrb as the spatial resolution is too low groundwater studies in the lrb are limited and the groundwater flow changes in response to climate warming remain unknown in such an alpine area numerical modeling is an effective tool to investigate the groundwater flow patterns characterize groundwater recharge and discharge and project the change of the groundwater flow system in response to future climate change in this study a three dimensional numerical groundwater flow model has been built for the lrb combining precipitation evapotranspiration glacier and permafrost the presented model is further calibrated via observed baseflow and water table measurements the purposes of this study are to 1 characterize the flow pattern and quantifying recharge and discharge of groundwater in the lrb 2 investigate the contribution of baseflow to runoff and 3 simulate the effects of future climate change

located in the southern tibetan plateau it is originated in the central part of the nyenchen tanglha mountains with a river length of about 551 km fig 1 a wu et al 2019 the lrb covering an area of 32 526 km2 is located within the latitudes of 29 20 31 18 n and longitudes of 90 04 93 21 e shi et al 2014 elevations of the region range from 3500 to 7000 m above mean sea level with a mean altitude of over 4000 m and an average river channel gradient of 0 29 chen et al 2019 lhasa is the capital city of the tibet autonomous region with population of 2 7 million and the highest degree of urbanization peng 2010 there are four hydrological stations in the lrb governing four sub basins respectively fig 1c pangdo tangga and lhasa stations are located in sequence along the mainstream of the lhasa river and the yangbajing station is situated in a tributary joining the lhasa river downstream the lhasa city peng and du 2010 qiu et al 2014 the spatial and temporal distributions of climate factors in the lrb are nonuniform during the year annual mean air temperature of the lrb is 7 7 c and annual mean precipitation is 437 8 mm fig 1b both gradually decreasing from south to north liu et al 2019 the hottest and wettest months are june to august because of the monsoon storms occurring from april to october prasch 2010 liu et al 2019 according to the meteorological features may to october can be regarded as the summer hot season and november to april in the next year as winter dry season bookhagen and burbank 2010 most of the rainfall is distributed in the summer hot season accounting for approximately 95 of the annual precipitation shi et al 2014 the total glacierized area in the lrb is 656 km2 accounting for 2 of the total area of the lrb table 1 including discontinuous glaciers in the upper lhasa river and continuous glaciers in the northwestern mountain ranges liu 1999 prasch 2010 glaciers are mainly found in high elevation 4000 m areas especially the northwestern watershed along the nyenchen tanglha mountains permafrost is detected in the upper basin with altitude over than 4800 m liu et al 2011 there are 6 land use types on the lrb including farmland grassland forest water body urban and unused land about 60 of the lrb is covered by grassland with an area of 20 010 km2 fig 2 the second largest land use type is unused land covering 30 of the total area and the rest land use types take up 10 2 2 data the 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem was utilized to define surface topography and extract the catchment boundaries of the lrb geological map of the lrb is from tibet geological survey 1979 the monthly data of precipitation and evaporation within the lrb during 1979 2000 were obtained from the china meteorological information center http data cma cn monthly runoff data at pangdo tangga lhasa and yangbajing stations during 1979 2000 were collected from institute of tibetan plateau research runoff data during 2003 2014 were obtained from huang et al 2020 the water table data were obtained from pumping wells in the downtown lhasa city which are multi year average data during 1979 2000 distributions of glacier and permafrost were obtained from the second glacier inventory data set of china zou et al 2017 the land use and land cover data were obtained from national tibetan plateau data center liu 2019 the future

concentration pathways rcps o neill et al 2016 more details about the four climate change scenarios were provided in the supplementary material 2 3 baseflow separation as lrb is vast and only limited water table monitoring data are available baseflow is an important indicator to calibrate the groundwater flow model previous studies show that baseflow is the main constrain to calibrate a groundwater flow model okello et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 although there are many baseflow separation methods in the literature e g price 2011 yang et al 2019 the methods are not verified in the lrb because of the complicated hydrological processes the constructed model simply assumed the winter dry season streamflow as baseflow when precipitation is limited and snowmelt water is rare walvoord et al 2012 similar studies also used the winter season streamflow as baseflow singh and jain 2003 tongal et al 2013 according to the calculation results the baseflow of lhasa river accounts for 26 3 of the runoff which is similar to the result 28 of isotope and chemistry baseflow separation method liu 1999 2 4 hydrogeological parameters hydrogeology of the lrb was simplified from the geological map of the tibet scale 1 1 000 000 geological profiles stratigraphic profiles and hydrogeological map of each model layer were obtained from the geological map and integrated into the groundwater flow model fig 1c hydrogeology of the region can be simplified into four units the alluvial sequence quaternary volcanic and mélange clastic sequences upper mesozoic to paleogene granite intrusion upper mesozoic to paleogene and terrigenous sequence paleozoic to mesozoic figs s1 and s2 hydraulic conductivity of the units was initially estimated from empirical values that are reported in previous studies ge et al 2008 gleeson et al 2011 and slightly modified during model calibration table 2 decrease of hydraulic conductivity with depth was included in the model and the depth dependent hydraulic conductivity is described by the integrated model kuang and jiao 2014 1 log k log k r log k s log k r 1 z β where k r is the residual permeability log k r is suggested to be 25 4 m2 for earth s continental crust in general k s is the surface permeability β is the decay index and z is the depth below ground surface this model provides improved fit to the measured permeability data and can be used to describe the permeability depth relationship through the entire earth s crust kuang and jiao 2014 the permeability can be transformed to hydraulic conductivity k by fetter 2001 2 k k ρ g μ where ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration and μ is the dynamic viscosity at 15 c other parameters including specific storage s s and specific yield s y are also listed in table 2 2 5 numerical model the three dimensional groundwater flow model was built based on the geological and land use maps of the lrb using the finite difference code modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 with the nwt solution niswonger et al 2011 the model was first built in steady state and then converted to transient state after calibration the steady state model represents a long term averaged condition and was used to figure out the groundwater flow pattern and water budget in the lrb the transient model aims to forecast the evolution of the groundwater flow system under different future climate change scenarios the model is 2 8 km thick in average and was discretized into 10 layers table s1 the thickness of the model layers ranges from 5 m of surface layer to 500 m of the deepest layer each layer s thickness increases exponentially with depth and layers under mountain areas are thickened while layers beneath valleys are thinned yao et al 2017 such model layer setup can improve the simulation accuracy of near surface active layer and ensure groundwater flow within 2 km depth can be modeled adequately ge et al 2008 there are 219 rows and 323 columns in each model layer and the model was discretized to 707 370 cells with 1 km 1 km resolution the lateral boundaries on the lrb s east west and north were specified as no flow conditions fig s3 the boundary type on the south is not clear because the basin topography is higher in the north and lower in the south and cross basin groundwater exchange may occur near the southern boundary as deep groundwater flow yao et al 2017 the southern lateral boundaries were set as a specified flux boundary and the groundwater exchange through this boundary can be changed in the model calibration fig s3 groundwater recharge was specified on the top layer of the model indicating the portion of rainfall or snowfall meltwater that infiltrates through the unsaturated zone and reach the water table infiltration coefficient of precipitation α i e ratio of groundwater recharge to precipitation is one of the main parameters controlling groundwater recharge rate in this model the parameter α depends on the topsoil texture which means land use of the lrb fig 2 is the main consideration when assigning α to the hydrological zones values of α in the model vary from 0 03 to 0 4 table 2 in consistence with the α values reported in a semiarid and arid area similar to the lrb scanlon et al 2006 groundwater seepage to river in the form of baseflow and evapotranspiration et are the main ways of discharge of the groundwater flow system drainage network was extracted from the hydrological analysis based on dem using qgis qgis development team 2020 and then discretized to the model grid river stage and bed elevation were also obtained from the dem the evapotraspiration package evt was used to simulate the transpiration effect of plants and direct evaporation that reduce the potential groundwater resources banta 2000 throughout the studied area the maximum evaporation rate and the extinction depth are respectively 13 7 mm yr and 4 mm yr shi et al 2014 at the southern boundary the yarlung zangbo riverbed collects the regional groundwater flow and was characterized via specified flux boundary conditions groundwater flow was assessed in the first four layers characterized by sediments with high conductivities glacier and permafrost distributions are important model inputs that can alter the groundwater recharge rate and hydraulic conductivity glaciations change the pressure overlying the aquifer and the ice melting rate during glacier receding or advancing affecting the recharge and discharge relationships between groundwater and surface water provost et al 2012 given that the glaciers are increasingly retreating due to climate warming yao et al 2012 glacier meltwater water is becoming a considerable resource in the lrb glacier s effect on groundwater can be regarded as a constant head boundary condition boulton et al 1995 bense and person 2008 cohen et al 2010 normani and sykes 2012 mackay et al 2020 or a constant flux boundary condition van weert et al 1997 breemer et al 2002 carlson et al 2007 somers et al 2019 in the model a constant flux boundary condition was assigned to the grids covered by glacier on the top layer and subsequently calibrated by the observed baseflow this approach has been proven to be reasonable in numerical groundwater flow models with glaciation van weert et al 1997 breemer et al 2002 carlson et al 2007 lemieux et al 2008 markovich et al 2016 glacier recharge rate was assigned 300 mm yr after calibration as a constant flux condition on the top layer where the glacier distributed roughly equal to the annual precipitation the glacier recharge rate was set as an initial estimation and then adjusted during the model calibration permafrost is generally a low permeability layer and treated as an aquitard by previous studies breemer et al 2002 van weert et al 1997 cheng and jin 2013 wang et al 2019 the cells located in permafrost area were assigned a hydraulic conductivity of 10 6 m d initially ge et al 2008 far lower than those of the aquifers cells within the seasonally frozen ground area were treated as normal grids kurylyk et al 2016 the thickness of permafrost layer is 4 30 m depending on the distance from the edge of the frozen ground feng 2015 2 6 transient model the steady state model was changed into a transient model to predict the evolution of the groundwater system in response to future climate change the model setting of the transient model is the same as that of the steady state model changes of precipitation from the cmip6 scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 ssp5 8 5 were used as input for the transient model specific storage and specific yield were also added to the transient model table 2 other parameters including hydraulic conductivity infiltration rate evapotranspiration and glacier recharge remain the same as those in the steady state model the transient model simulates the evolution of the groundwater flow system in the next 80 years 2020 2100 under the four future climate change scenarios 3 results 3 1 model calibration parameters including hydraulic conductivity k and infiltration coefficient of precipitation α were first assigned and then adjusted during model calibration parameters that give the best agreement between simulated and observed data after calibration are listed in table 2 calibration followed the trial and error method supported by the baseflow and water table observation data both the observed baseflow and water table measurements come from the winter dry period i e from november to april in the next year to evaluate the performance of the groundwater flow model the absolute error ae relative error re and the fit nrmse yao et al 2017 was used supplementary material fig 3 a shows the comparison between simulated and observed baseflow of the four sub basins in the lrb for the steady state model the re values vary from 1 7 to 6 6 and the fit nrmse coefficient is 0 96 the simulated baseflow agrees well with the observed values fig 3b presents a comparison of the simulated and observed water tables multi year average during 1979 2000 for the steady state model the ae values ranges from 2 84 to 8 08 with a mean of 3 67 the fit nrmse coefficient is 0 80 all the observed water table data were obtained from pumping wells in the downtown lhasa city where the water table may be disturbed by pumping the resolution of the grid 1 km 1 km is greater than the influence radius 800 m of a extraction well wang and wang 2020 thus the computed water table should be higher than the observed water table values as can be seen in fig 3b most of the computed values are higher than the measured water tables which shows that the model should be reliable fig 3c presents a comparison of computed and observed baseflow during 2003 2014 at the lhasa hydrological station for the transient model the re values vary from 2 7 20 7 with an average of 10 8 and the fit nrmse coefficient is 0 74 overall the model calibration indicates that the model can provide reasonable and reliable results 3 2 groundwater flow pattern hydraulic head distribution in the lrb is mainly controlled by topography and the hydrogeological setting as the hydraulic head variations are subdued version of the surface elevation fig 4 a simulated hydraulic heads decrease from northeast to southwest in accordance with the topography such a hydraulic head distribution indicates a general northeast to southwest groundwater flow direction the highest hydraulic head of 5435 m is located in the nyenchen tanglha mountains in the western part of the basin while the lowest hydraulic head of 3586 m is observed at the outlet of the lrb these two points correspond to the highest and lowest elevations of the study area the mean hydraulic gradient in the lrb is 2 9 relatively high hydraulic gradients are located in the upper reaches of the basin the greatest hydraulic gradient is up to 16 in the mountain areas of eastern and western lrb near the divide hydraulic gradient in the central lrb becomes small as the slope decrease to 1 in this area in correspondence of the quaternary deposits characterized by relatively high hydraulic conductivities a typical profile from the glacierized area through the lhasa city showing the groundwater flow system is presented in fig 4b the groundwater flow system is relatively complicated with both local and regional flowlines variation of the infiltration coefficient of precipitation α depends on the different types of topsoils approximately 13 6 of precipitation 71 6 mm yr infiltrates into the saturated zone and become groundwater among which 93 4 discharges to streams as baseflow and 5 5 returns to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration 4 2 mm yr only 1 1 flows out through the southern boundary more than 80 of the groundwater flow is constrained within 0 0 3 km below ground surface recharge of glacier meltwater to groundwater is not a significant component the amount of groundwater recharge from glacier meltwater is 5 4 mm yr which is 7 1 of the total groundwater recharge for the yangbajing sub basin in which glaciers are extensively distributed and the glaciers are retreating massively due to global warming yao et al 2007 2004 the simulated glacier melting rate is 29 1 mm yr and accounting for 34 7 of the total groundwater recharge interactions between groundwater and surface water and the magnitude of exchange rates are shown in fig 5 a the positive value means water flow from river to groundwater and the negative value means groundwater to river discharge in most river reaches groundwater discharges into rivers as baseflow with a magnitude of 28 8 0 m3 d per meter relatively high discharge rates appear in the middle reaches of the lhasa river the river reaches with positive values indicate that the river water feed groundwater where water level in the rivers should be higher than that of groundwater the positive values are mostly distributed in the first order tributaries in the upper stream of the lhasa river with magnitude of 0 40 1 m3 d per meter a modpath analysis was carried out based on the modflow simulation results fig 5b a total of 4536 pathlines were described where groundwater flow terminated by discharging to rivers with particle tracking distances and tracking times the shortest tracking distance is 0 5 km and the longest is 43 6 km the particle tracking time ranges from 67 days to 753 482 years the area with dense pathlines such as the mid southern lrb and depressions located at mountain front on the western lrb gain more recharge from groundwater and the range of groundwater tracking time tends to be wider mountain areas in the pando sub basin especially if permafrost is present tend to have sparser and shorter pathlines indicating short refreshing periods in these places and young groundwater ages the particle tracking time is related to the tracking distance but there is not obvious functional relationship because of the various depth dependent hydraulic conductivity 10 6 101 m d as shown in fig 6 tracking time between 10 100 years account for 52 6 of the pathlines the tracking distances less than 10 km long account for 85 of the pathlines which means local circulation plays a predominant role in groundwater flow 3 3 parameter sensitivity analysis infiltration recharge hydraulic conductivity aquifer thickness and distance between surface water features are significant parameters for configuring water table haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 a sensitivity analysis was carried out characterizing the hydraulic conductivity k s ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity k h k v infiltration coefficient of precipitation α decay index β glacier recharge specific storage s s specific yield s y southern boundary discharge hydraulic conductivity of permafrost maximum evapotranspiration rate and extinction depth table s2 the two model output variables of baseflow and hydraulic head were used to quantify how the model change with the input variables results of sensitivity analysis show that α and k s affect the hydraulic head and baseflow the most table s2 the infiltration recharge and hydraulic conductivity are the main parameters during the model calibration in this model the infiltration recharge is mainly affected by the infiltration coefficient of precipitation α and the hydraulic conductivity is mainly affected by the decay index β in the permeability depth model thus the following sensitivity analysis is focused on the infiltration coefficient of precipitation α and the decay index β the infiltration coefficient of precipitation α was set to vary between 0 03 to 0 40 for different land use types table 2 in the sensitivity analysis α was changed 10 for each land use type at each time fig 7 a shows the differences of baseflow in the four hydrological stations and average water table of the lrb varying α as α increases both baseflow and mean water table increase linearly meanwhile the discharge percentage of baseflow and evapotranspiration are slightly increased and decreased with variation less than 5 respectively the discharge percentage of southern boundary discharge remains constantly at about 1 the decay index β controls the rate of decrease of permeability with depth kuang and jiao 2014 a sensitivity analysis on the decay index β was also conducted to evaluate its effect on groundwater flow kuang and jiao 2014 suggested that for earth s continental crust in general the decay index β is equal to 0 25 the decay index β was set to vary from 0 1 to 0 45 in the sensitivity analysis fig 7b as β increases permeability decreases faster with depth thus leads to steepened groudwater table and reduces groundwater flow velocity according to the darcy s law the baseflow discharge decreases with β but the evapotranspiration and southern boundary discharge increases with β fig 7b simulated hydraulic head distributions along the a aʹ profile as β increases are shown in fig 8 as β increases strata s permeability at great depths become smaller thus the vertical velocity of groundwater flow decreases and less groundwater flows into deep aquifers the decrease of strata s permeability will also lead to less groundwater discharge to the downstream areas and the groundwater flow system also tends to be simpler 3 4 groundwater flow system in the next 80 years 2020 2100 the groundwater flow system was simulated for the next 80 years 2020 2100 based on the future climate scenarios using the transient model the four climate change scenarios show different trends in annual air temperature during 2020 2100 fig s4 a combination of groundwater flow patterns in the four scenarios in four typical years 2020 2040 2060 2100 is shown in fig 9 hydraulic head in the whole basin is related to precipitation under the same future climate change scenario higher precipitation corresponds to higher hydraulic head in the basin the variations of the hydraulic heads in the high altitude areas also becomes more significant the rise of hydraulic head in mountainous areas upstream sectors and the nyenchen tanglha mountains is greater than that of the other areas indicating that changes in groundwater flow system in high mountain areas are greater than the other areas the results also imply that the groundwater flow system in high mountain areas is more sensitive to climate change fig 10 shows the variations of baseflow and hydraulic head under the four future climate change scenarios the period of 1998 2014 represents the past and 2020 2100 represents the future the past and future annual precipitation data were obtained from observation and the cmip6 climate change scenarios the baseflow and hydraulic head fluctuate with the variation of future annual precipitation the baseflow shows increase trends under the four climate change scenarios and the increase trends range from 0 07 to 0 21 m3 s per year table 3 the baseflow shows the greatest increasing trend in ssp5 8 5 and the smallest trend in ssp1 2 6 the mean hydraulic head also increases with the precipitation increment the greatest increase in hydraulic head is also in ssp5 8 5 as the smallest occurs within ssp1 2 6 the magnitude of variation in baseflow becomes greater after about 2035 which indicates that wet year will become wetter and dry year will become drier in the future fig 10 extremely high precipitation and corresponding high hydraulic head and baseflow will become more frequently than the past and the change of groundwater flow system will be intensified in the future 4 discussion 4 1 model uncertainties uncertainties analysis of the model is based on the sensitivity analysis results of the sensitivity analysis show that α is the most sensitive factors affecting baseflow in the lrb table s2 glacier recharge and surface hydraulic conductivity k s are also sensitive factors affecting the baseflow table s2 baseflow increase in the lrb is predictable in the future result from the climate warming surface hydraulic conductivity k s affects the hydraulic head the most and glacier recharge is the next in the transient model glacier and permafrost are constant inputs from the results of uncertainty analysis the hydraulic conductivity of permafrost has the smallest effect on both baseflow and hydraulic head among all the input values so ignoring the changes of permafrost has an almost null impact on the model however glacier recharge is the second significant factors affecting the groundwater flow model the largest uncertainty of the transient model comes from glacier recharge the glacier recharge rate in the transient model for prediction uses the historical value i e the glacier recharge rate averaged from 1979 2000 uncertainty of the transient model is mainly due to the difference in the glacier recharge rates between the past and the future according to the trend of temperature change in the lhasa river basin the annual warming rate from 1979 to 2000 is 0 053 year while the annual warming rate from 2003 to 2014 is 0 067 year with the maximum and minimum value of 1 3 year and 0 78 year respectively assuming that the trend of glacier melt and recharge is consistent with the trend of temperature the rate of glacier recharge varies by 26 4 leading to the uncertainty of about 141007 7 m3 d 2 1 in baseflow and 2 1 m 0 1 in hydraulic head even if the model is not very sensitive to some parameters their cumulative effect may be significant evapotranspiration in the model was assigned a uniform value constant extinct depth and constant maximum evapotranspiration rate over the whole lrb factors affecting groundwater evaporation such as land use type and vadose zone porosity were not fully taken into account in the model specific storage and specific yield were important parameters in the transient model but they were set as constants for each type of the aquifer material similar to hydraulic conductivity specific storage also decreases with depth kuang et al 2021 the decrease of specific storage with depth was not taken into account in the transient model the water table observation data used in the model calibration also have some uncertainties as the water table observation data were obtained from pumping wells the water table were affected by the groundwater withdrawal the observed water tables are lower than the natural values without groundwater withdrawal in addition the measured water table data are all located in the lhasa city because there is no well in the remaining portions of the study area the lack of water table observation data will also lead to some uncertainties of the model 4 2 limitations this study made the first attempt to construct a numerical groundwater flow model coupled with the effects of glacier and permafrost for the lrb due to the scarce groundwater literature in this alpine region and the not abundant observation data to calibrate the model there are some limitations in the current model first the transient model coupling future climate change was built based on the steady state model and the calibration of the transient model fit nrmse 0 74 is not good as the steady state model fit nrmse 0 96 the calibration targets come from annual baseflow separation and no baseflow time series are available for model calibration the model also cannot reflect the glacier and permafrost changes due to climate warming an accurate groundwater recharge rate from glaciers is yet to be clarified as the climate warming the influence of seasonal permafrost freeze thaw processes and the thaw of permafrost due to future climate warming are not considered in addition to the influence of precipitation there are many other factors such as evaporation temperature and radiation that will affect the groundwater flow system in the future climate change scenarios ignoring these factors will reduce the reliability of the prediction results of the model despite these limitations and uncertainties of the current model the results agree with observation data and provide preliminarily the interactions between groundwater and surface water the model also provides for the first time the patterns of the groundwater flow system and the response of the groundwater system to future climate change in the lrb 5 conclusions a three dimensional numerical groundwater flow model was built for the lrb accounting for precipitation evapotranspiration land use glacier and permafrost the model was calibrated by baseflow data during winter dry season and water table observed in pumping wells in the lhasa city reasonable agreement is achieved fit nrmse 0 96 between simulated and measured data response of the groundwater flow system to future climate change was also predicted based on different future climate changes scenarios results show that about 13 6 of precipitation infiltrates and becomes groundwater more than 80 of the groundwater flow within depth less than 0 3 km below the ground surface baseflow is the most important component of the model about 93 4 of the groundwater discharges to streams as baseflow 5 5 evaporates and 1 1 flow out through the southern boundary the overall recharge of glacier meltwater to groundwater is 10 of the total groundwater recharge across the lrb most groundwater flow within localized flow systems with tracking time less than 100 years and tracking distance shorter than 10 km the predicted baseflow and mean hydraulic head fluctuate with the variation of future annual precipitation in 2020 2100 both baseflow and mean hydraulic head increase with precipitation in the different future climate change scenarios the increasing trends in baseflow for the four scenarios range from 0 07 to 0 21 m3 s per year during 2020 2100 the baseflow variation will become greater in the future as wet year will become wetter and dry year will become drier groundwater flow pattern and interactions between groundwater and surface water are important to an improved water resources management and sustainable water usage in the lrb studies on groundwater in the lrb are becoming even more important due to climate warming groundwater flow model construction for such alpine areas with limited observation data and previous studies is still an unresolved issue this study makes the first attempt to build a groundwater flow model results of this study will help construct numerical groundwater flow models in river basins with geological and hydrogeological characteristics similar to the lrb on the tibetan plateau and other alpine regions credit authorship contribution statement jiachang chen model writing

8213,study region hudson bay lowlands watersheds ontario canada study focus the rivers in the hudson bay lowlands are a major source of freshwater entering the arctic ocean and they also cause major floods in recent decades this region has been affected by major changes in hydroclimatic processes attributed to climate change and natural climate variability in this study we used era5 reanalysis data hydrometric observations and the hydrological model mesh to investigate the impact of atmospheric circulation on the inter decadal variability of streamflow between 1979 and 2018 in the hudson bay lowlands the natural climate variability was assessed using a weather regimes approach based on the discretization of daily geopotential height anomalies z500 from era5 reanalysis as well as large scale oceanic and atmospheric variability modes new hydrological insights the results showed an anomalous convergence of atmospheric moisture flux between 1995 2008 that enhanced precipitation and increased streamflow in the western part of the region this moisture convergence was likely driven by the combination of i low pressure anomalies in the east coast of north america and ii low pressure anomalies in western regions of canada associated with the cold phase of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo since 2009 streamflow remains high likely due to more groundwater discharge associated with the degradation of permafrost keywords hudson bay lowlands subarctic region mesh streamflow era5 atmospheric circulation 1 introduction arctic and subarctic regions are affected by a strong warming serreze and barry 2011 which is accelerating the hydrological cycle due to an increase of liquid precipitation huntington 2006 and the degradation of permafrost evans et al 2020 the subsequent increase in streamflow volume discharged to the arctic ocean ahmed et al 2020 has a significant impact on oceanic circulation rennermalm et al 2007 and marine ecosystems steiner et al 2015 this change of hydrological regime in the arctic has been attributed to global warming which increased precipitation and permafrost melting bring et al 2016 even though there is a general trend toward an increase of streamflow in the arctic the interdecadal change of streamflow is highly variable between regions mostly due to large scale atmospheric patterns durocher et al 2019 the hudson bay lowlands situated in subarctic canada is one of the major basins contributing to freshwater input to the arctic ocean durocher et al 2019 and is also a region of flooding vulnerability abdelnour 2013 beaton et al 2019 shaw et al 2013 previous studies on this region have shown teleconnections with large scale atmospheric patterns a period of low streamflow and low precipitation observed in this region in the 1980s and early 1990s déry et al 2009 2011 was associated with a positive phase of the arctic oscillation ao déry and wood 2004 a negative phase of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and positive phase of the el nino southern oscillation enso déry and wood 2005 despite these previous researches documenting the role of large scale oceanic and atmospheric climate indices on streamflow in the hudson bay area the thermodynamic behind these links is still unclear and the last 10 15 years have not been thoroughly investigated moreover the measured streamflow is fragmented in this region with significant gaps between 1995 and 2007 déry et al 2016 making it difficult for the investigation of interannual and decadal variability of streamflow this study aimed to reconstruct the hydrological data in the period of missing data using hydrological modelling and investigate how atmospheric circulation modulated interdecadal variability of precipitation and streamflow over the 1979 2019 period in the hudson bay lowlands watersheds precipitation from era5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 and hydrometric data from 17 watersheds have been used as local observations the hydrological model mesh was applied to two watersheds of the hudson bay lowlands region to reconstruct streamflow in the 1995 2007 period and create continuous hydrometric series for the 1979 2019 period we finally used a synoptic climatological approach jones 1994 michelangeli et al 1995 to investigate how large scale recurrent atmospheric patterns modulated the variability of precipitation and streamflow around this period of reconstructed streamflow 2 data and method 2 1 study area the study area is a subregion south of hudson bay fig 1 it consists of part of the hudson bay lowlands underlain by paleozoic sedimentary rocks watersheds 1 4 and the precambrian shield to the south which underlies the headwater regions of the seventeen watersheds thin pleistocene till mantles most of the region the area of the paleozoic rock is mostly covered by wetlands and peatlands that are up to 3 4 m thick while the rest of the area is covered by coniferous forest in the west and mixed wood forest in the east the corresponding ecozones are the hudson plain and boreal shield marshall et al 1999 the watersheds vary greatly in size and all flow towards hudson bay to the north with relatively low relief gradients average slope 0 5 m km sporadic permafrost is present in the north west part of the region department of energy mines and resources canada 1995 which could contribute to poor surface drainage marshall et al 1999 for the purpose of this study water survey canada wsc hydrometric data from seventeen watersheds were used table 1 these stations recorded streamflow between 1965 and 2018 but most of them have missing data especially in the 1995 2006 period 2 2 mesh hydrological modelling the hydrometric data were consistently missing for almost all watersheds from 1995 to 2006 making the analysis of long term streamflow variability challenging therefore two watersheds were selected and used to calibrate and run the hydrological model mesh modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology pietroniro et al 2007 over 1979 2019 period mesh is a semi distributed model that simulates hydrological and land surface processes at a catchment scale a more detailed description of mesh can be found in the supplementary materials section s1 and in verseghy 2019 mesh has been extensively used for catchment scale hydrologic studies in canada davison et al 2019 haghnegahdar et al 2015 morales marín et al 2019 rokaya et al 2019 yassin et al 2017 in this study mesh was applied to the windigo river 04cb001 and the groundhog river 04ld001 watersheds orange contours in fig 1 groundhog river watershed situated on the east end of the region contains a flux tower site that measured meteorological data for the 2003 2014 period mccaughey et al 2006 these measurements are fundamental to this study because they allowed the validation of the meteorological input data used to run mesh section 2 3 windigo river watershed was chosen because it has a similar size to groundhog river watershed and is located in the west end of the hudson bay lowlands fig 1 these watersheds were delineated by the software green kenue canadian hydraulics centre 2010 using the ontario provincial digital elevation model omnrf 2019 green kenue defines for each grid the drainage area the channel slope the channel length the elevation and the cascade of flow between grids the grid size was set at 0 25 18 km x 28 km resolution and correspond to the grids of the input data from era5 reanalyses section 2 3 green kenue also defined the proportion of each gru for each grid using the canadian land cover circa 2000 dataset natural resources canada 2020 the grus in this study were composed of needleleaf forest broadleaf forest mixed forest shrubland grassland wetland barren and water background values of vegetation physical parameters corresponding to each gru used in this study were the typical values provided by verseghy 2012 these values were aggregated over three main vegetated categories nl bl and gr with crops being negligible in these watersheds the mixed forest was treated as 50 of needleleaf trees and 50 of broadleaf trees the values from shrubland and wetland were aggregated with the grassland the percentage of sand clay and organic matter was estimated for the entire watershed using the quaternary geology of ontario map ontario geological survey 1997 all the parameters values used in mesh are presented in table s1 for calibration purpose mesh was run over 1979 2019 period using era5 reanalysis data as model input data the calibration was done using the dynamical dimension search dds a stochastic global search algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 dds was successfully used with mesh in a previous study in the great lakes region haghnegahdar et al 2015 dds was applied using the sum of square errors between daily hydrometric observations from water survey canada and the mesh simulations performed using era5 input the calibration was applied to the 1985 1994 and 2009 2019 periods the years 1979 1984 were used as a warm up period and the observations in the years 1995 2007 were missing 2 3 climate data observed climatic data are very scarce in this region therefore the reanalysis era5 data were used as input in mesh these input data included hourly values of downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation air temperature at 2 m above surface specific humidity at 1000 hpa level wind speed at 10 m above surface precipitation and surface pressure era5 is the most recent set of reanalysis produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf and covers the period between 1979 and 2019 at 0 25 grid resolution hersbach et al 2020 the data used in mesh were compared to observations from the flux tower site in the groundhog river watershed mccaughey et al 2006 and were found to be satisfactory at daily timestep see supplementary materials section s2 additionally we used era5 precipitation data in regions surrounding each simulated watershed the severn river area containing windigo river watershed west fig 1 red square and the moose river area hosting the groundhog river watershed east fig 1 blue square we also used era5 data for a domain covering a large part of northeast north america 115 w 60w 35 n 65 n to investigate the impact of regional atmospheric circulation on local conditions this domain is centered around the study area and integrates the major meteorological systems that affect this region fig 6 these data included geopotential height at 500hpa level z500 sea level pressure slp integrated specific humidity below 500 hpa level and integrated wind below 500 hpa level integrated moisture flux below 500 hpa was calculated by the product of integrated specific humidity and integrated wind 2 4 weather regimes computation daily z500 anomalies in the 1979 2019 period from era5 served to calculate weather regimes in the northeastern north america domain using the k means algorithm michelangeli et al 1995 the k means algorithm is an iterative process that creates n classes of similar daily z500 spatial patterns a principal component analysis was first applied to the daily z500 anomalies and principal components explaining 80 of the variance were used in the k means algorithm which is sufficient to cover most of large scale flow variability vigaud et al 2018 the k means algorithm first chooses randomly n days as centroid of each n number of class all the other days are classified with the closest day among the n days previously chosen in term of their eigenvalues a new centroid is calculated for each class by averaging the eigenvalues of all the days composing the class in the next step all the days are again classified to the closest centroid and new centroids are calculated these steps are repeated until the inter class variance is maximized this entire process was repeated 100 times for each number of classes n between 2 and 10 the number of classes kept in this study was determined by a red noise test characterized by the comparison of the classes generated by the observed dataset with classes determined from numerically generated maps that have the same statistical properties e g serial correlation michelangeli et al 1995 the red noise test showed that a classification with 8 regimes has the most significant classifiability index figure s8 weather regimes were previously calculated in north america with four significant weather regimes straus et al 2007 vigaud et al 2018 however these studies used a very large domain surrounding north america not adapted to a focus on a specific region such as the hudson bay lowlands 2 5 theoretical precipitation dataset to assess how weather regimes frequency modulates the variability of precipitation in a specific region a theoretical dataset approach was used the mean era5 precipitation corresponding to each regime in the period 1979 2019 was first calculated for the two regions severn and moose river areas fig 1 these average precipitation amounts were then assigned to each day according to the regime that occur the dataset is therefore composed only of the 1979 2019 precipitation average associated with each regime in each region the theoretical dataset was calculated for two periods of the year december to april when precipitation contribute to the spring peak flow and may to november this method has been previously applied on precipitation and temperature in europe fleig et al 2015 murawski et al 2018 asia gerlitz et al 2018 and the arctic champagne et al 2019 2 6 large scale variability modes the impact of large scale variability modes on weather regimes frequency and precipitation were also assessed in this study several atmospheric modes of variability were used including the north atlantic oscillation nao based on the difference of monthly sea level pressure between iceland and gibraltar jones 1994 the arctic oscillation ao calculated using the anomalies of geopotential height at 1000 hpa poleward of 20 n noaa ncep cpc 2020 the pacific north american pattern pna characterized by low pressure anomalies in eastern north america during it positive phase barnston and livezey 1987 and the east pacific north pacific pattern ep np similar to pna but mostly used in the warm season cpc 2020 in addition three oceanic modes of variability were assessed including the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo with a positive phase characterized by warm anomalies in the north atlantic ocean van oldenborgh et al 2009 the pacific decadal oscillation pdo with warm anomalies in eastern pacific when positive zhang et al 1997 and finally four indices of the el nino southern oscillation enso these four enso indices were calculated using slightly different regions of the pacific ocean ncei 2020 huang et al 2017 3 results 3 1 observed evolution of streamflow the streamflow records in the hudson bay lowlands watersheds have missing data between 1995 and 2006 but most of the watersheds have complete data consistently in the 1983 1994 and 2007 2018 periods for the 12 watersheds that have no missing data in these two periods the annual values of streamflow increased for most of the watersheds but the amplitude varied between watersheds fig 2 severn windigo severn tributary winisk and attawapiskat rivers were affected by an increase higher than 30 shamattawa and ogoki albany river tributary rivers show an increase close to 20 while albany and abitibi rivers depict an increase around 10 moose river tributaries and kenogami river albany river tributary show a stable change or a low decrease in streamflow in the watersheds with large streamflow increase the change occurred over the entire year for watersheds affected by a lower increase between 10 and 20 the increase was generally the highest in june july after the spring peak the abitibi river shows a large increase specifically during the peak season in may finally even the watersheds with very low increase in streamflow show an increase in winter flow a spatial pattern clearly appears with the watersheds associated to the highest increase in streamflow located in the west part of the region severn winisk attawapiskat while no increase was observed in the moose and east albany river watersheds fig 2 3 2 simulated streamflow in groundhog and windigo rivers the streamflow was simulated using mesh during the 1979 2018 period in windigo river watershed severn tributary and groundhog river watershed moose tributary the results of the simulations are shown in fig 3 and are satisfactory in both watersheds the peaks and the low flows are visually well recreated by the model for the two periods where observations were available the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is higher than 0 70 and the percent bias pbias lower than 12 for both watersheds and both periods which show a satisfactory quantitative fit moriasi et al 2007 in term of annual cycle the analysis was completed separately for the two periods with available observations 1983 1994 and 2009 2018 and the period in between were only hydrological simulations are available fig 4 a and b the results show that windigo river watershed shows less satisfactory results especially for the period 2009 2018 with an underestimation of the streamflow in winter spring and early summer the results for the period 1983 1994 were better but for both periods the autumn streamflow was overestimated in groundhog river watershed the streamflow was underestimated in late winter for both periods and was overestimated in autumn in the 2009 2018 period regarding the evolution of simulated streamflow between the two periods the main result was a higher streamflow in windigo river watershed for the 2009 2018 period that was consistent with the observations the simulated streamflow was even higher in the period with missing observation data 1995 2008 especially from june to november the simulated annual streamflow shows a clear difference between the windigo and groundhog river watersheds fig 4c and d the streamflow increased in windigo river watershed between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 while a slight decrease was simulated in groundhog river watershed for the same period in the following period 2009 2018 the streamflow in windigo river watershed decreased whereas it slightly increased in the groundhog river watershed a pettitt test pettitt 1979 applied to the simulated streamflow confirmed a significant break in the record period around 1994 1997 for the windigo watershed taking the two first periods together 1983 2008 the break occurred also in 1994 1997 the pettitt test was also applied to the 1995 2018 period only and a significant shift occurred around 2008 supplementary material section s4 in the groundhog river watershed no significant shift was found using the pettitt test simulations were also compared to observations from other watersheds in the area fig 4c and d the simulation from windigo river watershed was compared to annual streamflow in severn winisk and attawapiskat river watersheds while simulation from groundhog river watershed was compared to other moose river tributaries winsik and attawapiskat rivers have two hydrometric stations table 1 so the records with the least amount of missing data were chosen for each watershed the simulations and the observations from windigo river watershed and other watersheds in the area show similar results in the 1986 1995 period in term of interannual variability fig 4c the streamflow from attawapiskat river observations and windigo river simulations were in close relationship confirming a shift toward a high streamflow in the 2000s fig 4c the records from winisk river were lower in this period but winisk river was nevertheless affected by an increase in streamflow in the 2009 2018 period the underestimation of windigo river simulations seems coherent compared to other observations in the area in the eastern side of the region fig 4d missinaibi river observations were very close to groundhog river observations in the 1983 1994 and 2009 2018 periods and also very close to groundhog river simulations during the missing data period 1995 2008 these results give high confidence in groundhog river simulations and suggest a lower variability of interdecadal streamflow in the moose river area 3 3 evolution of precipitation the evolution of daily average precipitation between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 and between 1995 2008 and 2009 2019 were calculated for the snow accumulation period december to april and the warm season may to november fig 5 a b d and e the precipitation during the cold season did not change significantly over these periods fig 5a b while during the warm seasons a significant increase in precipitation between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 affected the west part of the region fig 5d in 2009 2019 a decrease in precipitation occurred in the same region while in moose river area an increase was observed fig 5e the annual precipitation was calculated for severn river area and moose river area fig 5c and f cold season precipitation was consistently higher in the moose river area but for both areas no significant trends was observed fig 5c in the warm season moose river precipitation show a low decadal variability while severn river shows higher interdecadal variability of precipitation until 1994 and after 2011 the precipitation in severn river area was generally lower than the precipitation in moose river area but in the 1995 2011 period precipitation in the areas of severn and moose rivers were comparable fig 5f warm seasons in the 1997 2009 period were especially very humid in severn river area fig 5f which is consistent with high annual streamflow fig 4c 3 4 weather regimes and local conditions in the warm season fig 6 shows the weather regimes that were identified in the northeastern north america region using the k means algorithm the red noise test has shown that all 100 k means calculations are significant for 8 classes figure s8 and therefore 8 regimes were used in this study fig 6 shows the average anomalies of z500 and integrated wind under 500 hpa for each of the 8 regimes in the warm season may to november only the warm season was used here because it shows the highest interdecadal variability of precipitation fig 5 the 8 regimes are characterized by high and low z500 anomalies either distributed between the east and the west 8 low east 4 high east the north and south 3 low north 2 high north or by meteorological systems centered on the area 5 and 7 high anomalies 1 and 6 low anomalies the annual frequency of weather regimes is also shown in fig 6 regime 3 had the highest frequency with generally more than 50 occurrences per warm season the other regimes had a lower frequency but can occasionally reach 50 occurrences as shown by the regime 6 in the 2000s fig 6 fig 7 a b shows the daily precipitation corresponding to each regime for moose river and severn river areas over the entire period 1983 2019 regime 4 brought the most precipitation in the warm season for both areas regime 5 was also associated with more precipitation in severn river area while regime 1 brought more precipitation to moose river area the average precipitation associated to each weather regimes was changing between periods mainly in the severn watershed the amount of precipitation associated with regime 5 and 6 was increasing by 45 between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 period and decreased again between 1995 2008 and 2009 2019 the regime 4 and 7 also show an increase of precipitation close to 30 between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 fig 7c shows the annual theoretical precipitation amounts calculated for these two regions in may november the theoretical dataset quantifies the change of precipitation amount due to a change in frequency of weather regimes this theoretical precipitation dataset was not particularly high in the 1997 2009 warm seasons in the severn river area fig 7c these results suggest that the high precipitation amount observed in the severn river area in the 1997 2009 warm seasons was not likely due to a change in the occurrence of weather regimes but might rather be associated with thermodynamic changes occurring over this region to explain the thermodynamics behind the change in the amount of precipitation associated to each weather regime the evolution of z500 anomalies and integrated moisture flux anomalies under 500 hpa are shown for each regime between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 fig 8 and between 1995 2008 and 2009 2019 fig 9 the results show an increase in moisture flux from the atlantic ocean toward the continent for all 8 regimes between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 this change was likely due to lower z500 anomalies in the south east part of the domain consistently for all regimes fig 8 between 1995 2008 and 2009 2019 z500 increased in the same region reversing the direction of the moisture flux anomalies fig 9 in the western part of the domain the evolution of atmospheric circulation was more variable between regimes a decrease in z500 anomalies between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 was observed in the north west part of the domain specifically for regimes 4 5 6 and 7 fig 8 in the 2009 2019 period higher anomalies returned in the north west part of the domain during these regimes fig 9 table 2 depicts the pearson coefficients of correlations between the interannual weather regimes frequencies several large scale modes of variability and the amount of precipitation in moose river and severn river areas in may november the amount of precipitation in both moose and severn watersheds areas was positively correlated to regime 4 in addition the precipitation in moose watershed area was negatively correlated to regime 2 the main correspondence between large scale modes of variability and weather regimes frequencies came from the oceanic modes amo and pdo amo was positively correlated to regime 6 and negatively correlated to regime 7 while the contrary is depicted for pdo amo was also positively correlated to the amount of precipitation in severn watershed while pdo was negatively correlated to the precipitation in seven watershed pna and ep np show also significant correlations with severn watershed precipitation but the amplitude of the correlations is lower ao nao and enso were not included in the table because none of the correlations were significant similar results were found with the spearman non parametric test supplementary materials section s5 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties in simulated and observed streamflow the streamflow simulations were able to recreate satisfactorily the observations in windigo and groundhog river watersheds even for high flows fig 3 this result show that the reanalysis era5 were perfectly suitable to be used in mesh hydrological model this supports the results of essou et al 2017 that showed that reanalysis are suitable for hydrological modelling in canada especially for large watersheds 3000km2 that have few meteorological observations observations are very sparse in the two large watersheds used in this study while reanalysis contain all the gridded weather data needed for mesh computation most importantly observations available at a flux tower in the groundhog river watershed and era5 reanalysis show a good agreement supplementary materials s2 other uncertainties should be taken into consideration such as the ice jams breakups during spring high flows that can significantly alter the discharge measurements ambtman and hicks 2012 however our study focused mainly on the warm season with likely little impact of the ice jam floods on the results 4 2 atmospheric circulation to explain the inter decadal variability of streamflow the results showed a higher variability of streamflow between the investigated periods in the west hudson bay lowlands severn and windigo rivers area compared to the eastern part moose and groundhog rivers area mainly a higher streamflow in the western part of the region in the 1995 2008 period significant using the pettitt test fig 4 and section s4 corresponded to enhance summer rain fig 5 additionally the very close interdecadal evolution of hypothetical precipitation between severn and moose rivers areas fig 7c suggests that weather regimes had little to do with this east west precipitation difference regime 1 was probably the regime that depicted the most difference between both areas with more precipitation in moose watershed fig 7b and table 2 likely driven by southerly winds fig 6 but changes in frequency of regime 1 fig 6 was likely not sufficient to alter the variability of precipitation fig 7 moreover other atmospheric patterns such as regime 4 were associated to high precipitation in the entire area table 2 and fig 7a b with a low chance to create significant precipitation difference between the west and the east the higher precipitation amount in the 1995 2008 period in severn river area was specific to regimes 4 5 6 and 7 the common change of characteristics of these 4 regimes was the lower z500 anomalies in the northwest part of the domain driving southerly or westerly moisture fluxes anomalies fig 8 in all 8 regimes there was also an increase in moisture flux from the atlantic ocean directed toward the land fig 8 the convergence of moisture flux from the east and from the west due to low z500 anomalies during weather regimes 4 5 6 and 7 likely enhanced warm season precipitation in the region close to lake winnipeg including the west part of the hudson bay lowlands fig 5 the eastern part of the region including moose river and groundhog river watersheds was likely too far from these western low level pressures to be significantly impacted the higher moisture flux from the atlantic ocean observed in all regimes could be associated to a positive phase of the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo which was correlated to precipitation in severn watershed table 2 amo was in a warm phase during the 1995 2008 period and favored lower pressure in the western atlantic ocean hu et al 2011 similarly to our results fig 8 which could be partly responsible for the precipitation enhance in severn watershed the higher precipitation anomalies in this region during amo was also previously reported in a study focusing on north america hu et al 2011 however the link with amo must be taken with precaution as this oscillation might be an artifact of the greenhouse gases and aerosols signal mann et al 2021 the precipitation enhancement in the severn watershed could also be associated to a negative phase of ep np and pdo table 2 the 1995 2008 negative pressure anomalies observed in the north west part of our domain for some regimes fig 8 was in accordance with the negative phase of ep np characterized by negative pressure anomalies in western canada and positive anomalies in eastern canada cpc 2020 previous works have demonstrated an association between wetter conditions in this region and a negative phase of pdo hu and huang 2009 and also a link between ep np and pdo schulte and lee 2017 therefore it is likely that the association between precipitation and pdo was driven through the ep np atmospheric pattern the association between pdo and streamflow was already found in previous studies déry and wood 2005 durocher et al 2019 but the clear link between this climate index regional atmospheric circulation and the impact on precipitation was not shown in these studies our results suggest that in the 1995 2008 period the eastern wind anomalies in one side and the south western wind anomalies associated to the negative pdo ep np patterns in the other side likely favored a zone of convergence and precipitation enhancement in the severn river area further research is needed to determine why the influence of the pdo ep np seems to mostly alter certain weather patterns links between streamflow and other modes of variability such as the arctic oscillation were found in previous studies déry and wood 2005 durocher et al 2019 but were not confirmed in this work this is possibly due to the reduced number of watersheds used in this work while the previous studies investigated larger areas and watersheds in the northern part of the hudson bay complex our study suggests that even watersheds geographically close such as severn and moose river watersheds have variable links with large scale modes of variability showing the need to investigate separately different portions of the hudson bay lowlands area 4 3 alternate explanations in the variability of streamflow after wetter conditions in the 1995 2008 period for the severn river area the precipitation was decreased in the 2009 2019 period likely due to a reversal of the processes described in section 4 2 fig 9 however the observed streamflow remained relatively large and the simulated streamflow was not able to recreate this high streamflow in the windigo river watershed fig 4c one explanation can be a delay between the increase in precipitation and the increase in streamflow in the 2000s period of high precipitation in severn area the simulations in windigo river show high streamflow compared to observations available in the area whereas in the 2010s the simulations are lower than observations fig 4c this result suggests a too quick response of simulated streamflow to the increase in precipitation likely associated to a groundwater recharge discharge process not well simulated by mesh this interpretation is supported by the results from fig 4a showing the recent years underestimation occurring mostly in winter period when groundwater discharge represents most of the overall streamflow the inability of mesh to properly simulate groundwater recharge discharge process was possibly due to the recent global warming indeed evidence of increased winter base flow in subarctic regions also observed in our study fig 2 have been previously associated with permafrost thaw st jacques and sauchyn 2009 song et al 2020 evans et al 2020 qin et al 2020 the thickening of the active layer associated with permafrost thaw was likely increasing hydrogeologic connectivity between rivers and aquifers enhancing groundwater circulation lamontagne hallé et al 2018 a recent study in the hudson bay lowlands region confirmed a clear relationship between the warming and an increase in hydrogeologic conductivity enhancing winter baseflow wang 2019 the warming observed in the 1995 2008 period not shown likely enhanced the groundwater recharge mainly in areas affected by permafrost such as severn river department of energy mines and resources canada 1995 it is likely that permafrost played a role but whether the change was due to the release of frozen water trapped in the permafrost for a long period or due to the increase in hydraulic conductivity accelerating groundwater recharge and discharge remains unclear a better representation of the link between active layers and groundwater discharge will be needed in future simulations another difference between severn and moose rivers area could be associated with river regime regulation of moose river there are however several arguments against this hypothesis first regulation mostly changes the seasonality of streamflow déry et al 2018 but should not impacts long term trend of annual flow volume déry et al 2011 mcclelland et al 2006 second the interannual variability of streamflow in the groundhog river watershed moose river tributary was recreated by the model at the beginning and the end of the study period showing that calibrated parameters consistently recreated streamflow over the entire period finally another moose river tributary that is not regulated the missinaibi river has similar change of streamflow compared to the regulated groundhog river fig 2 5 conclusion the main objective of this study was to investigate the impact of atmospheric circulation on the inter decadal evolution of streamflow in the hudson bay lowlands given the large amount of missing hydrometric data streamflow has been simulated in the 1979 2019 period in two watersheds in the west and east part of the studied region using mesh hydrological model fed with era5 reanalysis data to investigate how atmospheric circulation impacted streamflow in this region we identified z500 based weather regimes as recurrent weather patterns in a large area of eastern north america by identifying the precipitation amount associated with each weather regime and the yearly occurrence of weather regimes we investigated if the inter decadal change of precipitation and streamflow was due to the change of occurrence of weather regimes or a change in their intrinsic characteristics the results can be summarized as follow 1 the streamflow was satisfactorily simulated by mesh in both watersheds and each was well representative of other watersheds in the west and east part of the studied region 2 a higher streamflow in the 1995 2008 period was simulated in the western watershed due to a change in intrinsic conditions of several weather regime patterns mainly higher precipitation driven by higher convergence of soil moisture flux 3 the higher convergence of moisture flux in the 1995 2008 period was associated with low pressure anomalies around lake winnipeg driven by a negative phase of pdo and ep np and by a general increase in moisture flux from the atlantic ocean 4 in the most recent period 2009 2018 moisture flux convergence decreased again reducing precipitation and simulated streamflow in the western region but the observed streamflow remained relatively high likely associated to an increase in groundwater discharge activated by permafrost degradation despite high confidence in the hydrological simulations performed in the two watersheds and their representativeness in the west and east part of the studied region these results could benefit from comparison with other hydrological models adapted to the arctic region bui et al 2020 and applied to more watersheds in the area future works should also focus on understanding the alteration of specific weather patterns during the negative phase of pdo and ep np changing regionally the amount of precipitation the specific mechanism for the origin of the relatively high streamflow in the recent period likely associated with permafrost also needs further investigations nevertheless mesh calibration performed in these two subarctic watersheds gives an opportunity to estimate the future change of streamflow in a region that is very sensitive to climate change funding this study was funded by natural resources canada canada centre for remote sensing and the

8213,study region hudson bay lowlands watersheds ontario canada study focus the rivers in the hudson bay lowlands are a major source of freshwater entering the arctic ocean and they also cause major floods in recent decades this region has been affected by major changes in hydroclimatic processes attributed to climate change and natural climate variability in this study we used era5 reanalysis data hydrometric observations and the hydrological model mesh to investigate the impact of atmospheric circulation on the inter decadal variability of streamflow between 1979 and 2018 in the hudson bay lowlands the natural climate variability was assessed using a weather regimes approach based on the discretization of daily geopotential height anomalies z500 from era5 reanalysis as well as large scale oceanic and atmospheric variability modes new hydrological insights the results showed an anomalous convergence of atmospheric moisture flux between 1995 2008 that enhanced precipitation and increased streamflow in the western part of the region this moisture convergence was likely driven by the combination of i low pressure anomalies in the east coast of north america and ii low pressure anomalies in western regions of canada associated with the cold phase of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo since 2009 streamflow remains high likely due to more groundwater discharge associated with the degradation of permafrost keywords hudson bay lowlands subarctic region mesh streamflow era5 atmospheric circulation 1 introduction arctic and subarctic regions are affected by a strong warming serreze and barry 2011 which is accelerating the hydrological cycle due to an increase of liquid precipitation huntington 2006 and the degradation of permafrost evans et al 2020 the subsequent increase in streamflow volume discharged to the arctic ocean ahmed et al 2020 has a significant impact on oceanic circulation rennermalm et al 2007 and marine ecosystems steiner et al 2015 this change of hydrological regime in the arctic has been attributed to global warming which increased precipitation and permafrost melting bring et al 2016 even though there is a general trend toward an increase of streamflow in the arctic the interdecadal change of streamflow is highly variable between regions mostly due to large scale atmospheric patterns durocher et al 2019 the hudson bay lowlands situated in subarctic canada is one of the major basins contributing to freshwater input to the arctic ocean durocher et al 2019 and is also a region of flooding vulnerability abdelnour 2013 beaton et al 2019 shaw et al 2013 previous studies on this region have shown teleconnections with large scale atmospheric patterns a period of low streamflow and low precipitation observed in this region in the 1980s and early 1990s déry et al 2009 2011 was associated with a positive phase of the arctic oscillation ao déry and wood 2004 a negative phase of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and positive phase of the el nino southern oscillation enso déry and wood 2005 despite these previous researches documenting the role of large scale oceanic and atmospheric climate indices on streamflow in the hudson bay area the thermodynamic behind these links is still unclear and the last 10 15 years have not been thoroughly investigated moreover the measured streamflow is fragmented in this region with significant gaps between 1995 and 2007 déry et al 2016 making it difficult for the investigation of interannual and decadal variability of streamflow this study aimed to reconstruct the hydrological data in the period of missing data using hydrological modelling and investigate how atmospheric circulation modulated interdecadal variability of precipitation and streamflow over the 1979 2019 period in the hudson bay lowlands watersheds precipitation from era5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 and hydrometric data from 17 watersheds have been used as local observations the hydrological model mesh was applied to two watersheds of the hudson bay lowlands region to reconstruct streamflow in the 1995 2007 period and create continuous hydrometric series for the 1979 2019 period we finally used a synoptic climatological approach jones 1994 michelangeli et al 1995 to investigate how large scale recurrent atmospheric patterns modulated the variability of precipitation and streamflow around this period of reconstructed streamflow 2 data and method 2 1 study area the study area is a subregion south of hudson bay fig 1 it consists of part of the hudson bay lowlands underlain by paleozoic sedimentary rocks watersheds 1 4 and the precambrian shield to the south which underlies the headwater regions of the seventeen watersheds thin pleistocene till mantles most of the region the area of the paleozoic rock is mostly covered by wetlands and peatlands that are up to 3 4 m thick while the rest of the area is covered by coniferous forest in the west and mixed wood forest in the east the corresponding ecozones are the hudson plain and boreal shield marshall et al 1999 the watersheds vary greatly in size and all flow towards hudson bay to the north with relatively low relief gradients average slope 0 5 m km sporadic permafrost is present in the north west part of the region department of energy mines and resources canada 1995 which could contribute to poor surface drainage marshall et al 1999 for the purpose of this study water survey canada wsc hydrometric data from seventeen watersheds were used table 1 these stations recorded streamflow between 1965 and 2018 but most of them have missing data especially in the 1995 2006 period 2 2 mesh hydrological modelling the hydrometric data were consistently missing for almost all watersheds from 1995 to 2006 making the analysis of long term streamflow variability challenging therefore two watersheds were selected and used to calibrate and run the hydrological model mesh modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology pietroniro et al 2007 over 1979 2019 period mesh is a semi distributed model that simulates hydrological and land surface processes at a catchment scale a more detailed description of mesh can be found in the supplementary materials section s1 and in verseghy 2019 mesh has been extensively used for catchment scale hydrologic studies in canada davison et al 2019 haghnegahdar et al 2015 morales marín et al 2019 rokaya et al 2019 yassin et al 2017 in this study mesh was applied to the windigo river 04cb001 and the groundhog river 04ld001 watersheds orange contours in fig 1 groundhog river watershed situated on the east end of the region contains a flux tower site that measured meteorological data for the 2003 2014 period mccaughey et al 2006 these measurements are fundamental to this study because they allowed the validation of the meteorological input data used to run mesh section 2 3 windigo river watershed was chosen because it has a similar size to groundhog river watershed and is located in the west end of the hudson bay lowlands fig 1 these watersheds were delineated by the software green kenue canadian hydraulics centre 2010 using the ontario provincial digital elevation model omnrf 2019 green kenue defines for each grid the drainage area the channel slope the channel length the elevation and the cascade of flow between grids the grid size was set at 0 25 18 km x 28 km resolution and correspond to the grids of the input data from era5 reanalyses section 2 3 green kenue also defined the proportion of each gru for each grid using the canadian land cover circa 2000 dataset natural resources canada 2020 the grus in this study were composed of needleleaf forest broadleaf forest mixed forest shrubland grassland wetland barren and water background values of vegetation physical parameters corresponding to each gru used in this study were the typical values provided by verseghy 2012 these values were aggregated over three main vegetated categories nl bl and gr with crops being negligible in these watersheds the mixed forest was treated as 50 of needleleaf trees and 50 of broadleaf trees the values from shrubland and wetland were aggregated with the grassland the percentage of sand clay and organic matter was estimated for the entire watershed using the quaternary geology of ontario map ontario geological survey 1997 all the parameters values used in mesh are presented in table s1 for calibration purpose mesh was run over 1979 2019 period using era5 reanalysis data as model input data the calibration was done using the dynamical dimension search dds a stochastic global search algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 dds was successfully used with mesh in a previous study in the great lakes region haghnegahdar et al 2015 dds was applied using the sum of square errors between daily hydrometric observations from water survey canada and the mesh simulations performed using era5 input the calibration was applied to the 1985 1994 and 2009 2019 periods the years 1979 1984 were used as a warm up period and the observations in the years 1995 2007 were missing 2 3 climate data observed climatic data are very scarce in this region therefore the reanalysis era5 data were used as input in mesh these input data included hourly values of downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation air temperature at 2 m above surface specific humidity at 1000 hpa level wind speed at 10 m above surface precipitation and surface pressure era5 is the most recent set of reanalysis produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf and covers the period between 1979 and 2019 at 0 25 grid resolution hersbach et al 2020 the data used in mesh were compared to observations from the flux tower site in the groundhog river watershed mccaughey et al 2006 and were found to be satisfactory at daily timestep see supplementary materials section s2 additionally we used era5 precipitation data in regions surrounding each simulated watershed the severn river area containing windigo river watershed west fig 1 red square and the moose river area hosting the groundhog river watershed east fig 1 blue square we also used era5 data for a domain covering a large part of northeast north america 115 w 60w 35 n 65 n to investigate the impact of regional atmospheric circulation on local conditions this domain is centered around the study area and integrates the major meteorological systems that affect this region fig 6 these data included geopotential height at 500hpa level z500 sea level pressure slp integrated specific humidity below 500 hpa level and integrated wind below 500 hpa level integrated moisture flux below 500 hpa was calculated by the product of integrated specific humidity and integrated wind 2 4 weather regimes computation daily z500 anomalies in the 1979 2019 period from era5 served to calculate weather regimes in the northeastern north america domain using the k means algorithm michelangeli et al 1995 the k means algorithm is an iterative process that creates n classes of similar daily z500 spatial patterns a principal component analysis was first applied to the daily z500 anomalies and principal components explaining 80 of the variance were used in the k means algorithm which is sufficient to cover most of large scale flow variability vigaud et al 2018 the k means algorithm first chooses randomly n days as centroid of each n number of class all the other days are classified with the closest day among the n days previously chosen in term of their eigenvalues a new centroid is calculated for each class by averaging the eigenvalues of all the days composing the class in the next step all the days are again classified to the closest centroid and new centroids are calculated these steps are repeated until the inter class variance is maximized this entire process was repeated 100 times for each number of classes n between 2 and 10 the number of classes kept in this study was determined by a red noise test characterized by the comparison of the classes generated by the observed dataset with classes determined from numerically generated maps that have the same statistical properties e g serial correlation michelangeli et al 1995 the red noise test showed that a classification with 8 regimes has the most significant classifiability index figure s8 weather regimes were previously calculated in north america with four significant weather regimes straus et al 2007 vigaud et al 2018 however these studies used a very large domain surrounding north america not adapted to a focus on a specific region such as the hudson bay lowlands 2 5 theoretical precipitation dataset to assess how weather regimes frequency modulates the variability of precipitation in a specific region a theoretical dataset approach was used the mean era5 precipitation corresponding to each regime in the period 1979 2019 was first calculated for the two regions severn and moose river areas fig 1 these average precipitation amounts were then assigned to each day according to the regime that occur the dataset is therefore composed only of the 1979 2019 precipitation average associated with each regime in each region the theoretical dataset was calculated for two periods of the year december to april when precipitation contribute to the spring peak flow and may to november this method has been previously applied on precipitation and temperature in europe fleig et al 2015 murawski et al 2018 asia gerlitz et al 2018 and the arctic champagne et al 2019 2 6 large scale variability modes the impact of large scale variability modes on weather regimes frequency and precipitation were also assessed in this study several atmospheric modes of variability were used including the north atlantic oscillation nao based on the difference of monthly sea level pressure between iceland and gibraltar jones 1994 the arctic oscillation ao calculated using the anomalies of geopotential height at 1000 hpa poleward of 20 n noaa ncep cpc 2020 the pacific north american pattern pna characterized by low pressure anomalies in eastern north america during it positive phase barnston and livezey 1987 and the east pacific north pacific pattern ep np similar to pna but mostly used in the warm season cpc 2020 in addition three oceanic modes of variability were assessed including the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo with a positive phase characterized by warm anomalies in the north atlantic ocean van oldenborgh et al 2009 the pacific decadal oscillation pdo with warm anomalies in eastern pacific when positive zhang et al 1997 and finally four indices of the el nino southern oscillation enso these four enso indices were calculated using slightly different regions of the pacific ocean ncei 2020 huang et al 2017 3 results 3 1 observed evolution of streamflow the streamflow records in the hudson bay lowlands watersheds have missing data between 1995 and 2006 but most of the watersheds have complete data consistently in the 1983 1994 and 2007 2018 periods for the 12 watersheds that have no missing data in these two periods the annual values of streamflow increased for most of the watersheds but the amplitude varied between watersheds fig 2 severn windigo severn tributary winisk and attawapiskat rivers were affected by an increase higher than 30 shamattawa and ogoki albany river tributary rivers show an increase close to 20 while albany and abitibi rivers depict an increase around 10 moose river tributaries and kenogami river albany river tributary show a stable change or a low decrease in streamflow in the watersheds with large streamflow increase the change occurred over the entire year for watersheds affected by a lower increase between 10 and 20 the increase was generally the highest in june july after the spring peak the abitibi river shows a large increase specifically during the peak season in may finally even the watersheds with very low increase in streamflow show an increase in winter flow a spatial pattern clearly appears with the watersheds associated to the highest increase in streamflow located in the west part of the region severn winisk attawapiskat while no increase was observed in the moose and east albany river watersheds fig 2 3 2 simulated streamflow in groundhog and windigo rivers the streamflow was simulated using mesh during the 1979 2018 period in windigo river watershed severn tributary and groundhog river watershed moose tributary the results of the simulations are shown in fig 3 and are satisfactory in both watersheds the peaks and the low flows are visually well recreated by the model for the two periods where observations were available the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is higher than 0 70 and the percent bias pbias lower than 12 for both watersheds and both periods which show a satisfactory quantitative fit moriasi et al 2007 in term of annual cycle the analysis was completed separately for the two periods with available observations 1983 1994 and 2009 2018 and the period in between were only hydrological simulations are available fig 4 a and b the results show that windigo river watershed shows less satisfactory results especially for the period 2009 2018 with an underestimation of the streamflow in winter spring and early summer the results for the period 1983 1994 were better but for both periods the autumn streamflow was overestimated in groundhog river watershed the streamflow was underestimated in late winter for both periods and was overestimated in autumn in the 2009 2018 period regarding the evolution of simulated streamflow between the two periods the main result was a higher streamflow in windigo river watershed for the 2009 2018 period that was consistent with the observations the simulated streamflow was even higher in the period with missing observation data 1995 2008 especially from june to november the simulated annual streamflow shows a clear difference between the windigo and groundhog river watersheds fig 4c and d the streamflow increased in windigo river watershed between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 while a slight decrease was simulated in groundhog river watershed for the same period in the following period 2009 2018 the streamflow in windigo river watershed decreased whereas it slightly increased in the groundhog river watershed a pettitt test pettitt 1979 applied to the simulated streamflow confirmed a significant break in the record period around 1994 1997 for the windigo watershed taking the two first periods together 1983 2008 the break occurred also in 1994 1997 the pettitt test was also applied to the 1995 2018 period only and a significant shift occurred around 2008 supplementary material section s4 in the groundhog river watershed no significant shift was found using the pettitt test simulations were also compared to observations from other watersheds in the area fig 4c and d the simulation from windigo river watershed was compared to annual streamflow in severn winisk and attawapiskat river watersheds while simulation from groundhog river watershed was compared to other moose river tributaries winsik and attawapiskat rivers have two hydrometric stations table 1 so the records with the least amount of missing data were chosen for each watershed the simulations and the observations from windigo river watershed and other watersheds in the area show similar results in the 1986 1995 period in term of interannual variability fig 4c the streamflow from attawapiskat river observations and windigo river simulations were in close relationship confirming a shift toward a high streamflow in the 2000s fig 4c the records from winisk river were lower in this period but winisk river was nevertheless affected by an increase in streamflow in the 2009 2018 period the underestimation of windigo river simulations seems coherent compared to other observations in the area in the eastern side of the region fig 4d missinaibi river observations were very close to groundhog river observations in the 1983 1994 and 2009 2018 periods and also very close to groundhog river simulations during the missing data period 1995 2008 these results give high confidence in groundhog river simulations and suggest a lower variability of interdecadal streamflow in the moose river area 3 3 evolution of precipitation the evolution of daily average precipitation between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 and between 1995 2008 and 2009 2019 were calculated for the snow accumulation period december to april and the warm season may to november fig 5 a b d and e the precipitation during the cold season did not change significantly over these periods fig 5a b while during the warm seasons a significant increase in precipitation between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 affected the west part of the region fig 5d in 2009 2019 a decrease in precipitation occurred in the same region while in moose river area an increase was observed fig 5e the annual precipitation was calculated for severn river area and moose river area fig 5c and f cold season precipitation was consistently higher in the moose river area but for both areas no significant trends was observed fig 5c in the warm season moose river precipitation show a low decadal variability while severn river shows higher interdecadal variability of precipitation until 1994 and after 2011 the precipitation in severn river area was generally lower than the precipitation in moose river area but in the 1995 2011 period precipitation in the areas of severn and moose rivers were comparable fig 5f warm seasons in the 1997 2009 period were especially very humid in severn river area fig 5f which is consistent with high annual streamflow fig 4c 3 4 weather regimes and local conditions in the warm season fig 6 shows the weather regimes that were identified in the northeastern north america region using the k means algorithm the red noise test has shown that all 100 k means calculations are significant for 8 classes figure s8 and therefore 8 regimes were used in this study fig 6 shows the average anomalies of z500 and integrated wind under 500 hpa for each of the 8 regimes in the warm season may to november only the warm season was used here because it shows the highest interdecadal variability of precipitation fig 5 the 8 regimes are characterized by high and low z500 anomalies either distributed between the east and the west 8 low east 4 high east the north and south 3 low north 2 high north or by meteorological systems centered on the area 5 and 7 high anomalies 1 and 6 low anomalies the annual frequency of weather regimes is also shown in fig 6 regime 3 had the highest frequency with generally more than 50 occurrences per warm season the other regimes had a lower frequency but can occasionally reach 50 occurrences as shown by the regime 6 in the 2000s fig 6 fig 7 a b shows the daily precipitation corresponding to each regime for moose river and severn river areas over the entire period 1983 2019 regime 4 brought the most precipitation in the warm season for both areas regime 5 was also associated with more precipitation in severn river area while regime 1 brought more precipitation to moose river area the average precipitation associated to each weather regimes was changing between periods mainly in the severn watershed the amount of precipitation associated with regime 5 and 6 was increasing by 45 between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 period and decreased again between 1995 2008 and 2009 2019 the regime 4 and 7 also show an increase of precipitation close to 30 between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 fig 7c shows the annual theoretical precipitation amounts calculated for these two regions in may november the theoretical dataset quantifies the change of precipitation amount due to a change in frequency of weather regimes this theoretical precipitation dataset was not particularly high in the 1997 2009 warm seasons in the severn river area fig 7c these results suggest that the high precipitation amount observed in the severn river area in the 1997 2009 warm seasons was not likely due to a change in the occurrence of weather regimes but might rather be associated with thermodynamic changes occurring over this region to explain the thermodynamics behind the change in the amount of precipitation associated to each weather regime the evolution of z500 anomalies and integrated moisture flux anomalies under 500 hpa are shown for each regime between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 fig 8 and between 1995 2008 and 2009 2019 fig 9 the results show an increase in moisture flux from the atlantic ocean toward the continent for all 8 regimes between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 this change was likely due to lower z500 anomalies in the south east part of the domain consistently for all regimes fig 8 between 1995 2008 and 2009 2019 z500 increased in the same region reversing the direction of the moisture flux anomalies fig 9 in the western part of the domain the evolution of atmospheric circulation was more variable between regimes a decrease in z500 anomalies between 1983 1994 and 1995 2008 was observed in the north west part of the domain specifically for regimes 4 5 6 and 7 fig 8 in the 2009 2019 period higher anomalies returned in the north west part of the domain during these regimes fig 9 table 2 depicts the pearson coefficients of correlations between the interannual weather regimes frequencies several large scale modes of variability and the amount of precipitation in moose river and severn river areas in may november the amount of precipitation in both moose and severn watersheds areas was positively correlated to regime 4 in addition the precipitation in moose watershed area was negatively correlated to regime 2 the main correspondence between large scale modes of variability and weather regimes frequencies came from the oceanic modes amo and pdo amo was positively correlated to regime 6 and negatively correlated to regime 7 while the contrary is depicted for pdo amo was also positively correlated to the amount of precipitation in severn watershed while pdo was negatively correlated to the precipitation in seven watershed pna and ep np show also significant correlations with severn watershed precipitation but the amplitude of the correlations is lower ao nao and enso were not included in the table because none of the correlations were significant similar results were found with the spearman non parametric test supplementary materials section s5 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties in simulated and observed streamflow the streamflow simulations were able to recreate satisfactorily the observations in windigo and groundhog river watersheds even for high flows fig 3 this result show that the reanalysis era5 were perfectly suitable to be used in mesh hydrological model this supports the results of essou et al 2017 that showed that reanalysis are suitable for hydrological modelling in canada especially for large watersheds 3000km2 that have few meteorological observations observations are very sparse in the two large watersheds used in this study while reanalysis contain all the gridded weather data needed for mesh computation most importantly observations available at a flux tower in the groundhog river watershed and era5 reanalysis show a good agreement supplementary materials s2 other uncertainties should be taken into consideration such as the ice jams breakups during spring high flows that can significantly alter the discharge measurements ambtman and hicks 2012 however our study focused mainly on the warm season with likely little impact of the ice jam floods on the results 4 2 atmospheric circulation to explain the inter decadal variability of streamflow the results showed a higher variability of streamflow between the investigated periods in the west hudson bay lowlands severn and windigo rivers area compared to the eastern part moose and groundhog rivers area mainly a higher streamflow in the western part of the region in the 1995 2008 period significant using the pettitt test fig 4 and section s4 corresponded to enhance summer rain fig 5 additionally the very close interdecadal evolution of hypothetical precipitation between severn and moose rivers areas fig 7c suggests that weather regimes had little to do with this east west precipitation difference regime 1 was probably the regime that depicted the most difference between both areas with more precipitation in moose watershed fig 7b and table 2 likely driven by southerly winds fig 6 but changes in frequency of regime 1 fig 6 was likely not sufficient to alter the variability of precipitation fig 7 moreover other atmospheric patterns such as regime 4 were associated to high precipitation in the entire area table 2 and fig 7a b with a low chance to create significant precipitation difference between the west and the east the higher precipitation amount in the 1995 2008 period in severn river area was specific to regimes 4 5 6 and 7 the common change of characteristics of these 4 regimes was the lower z500 anomalies in the northwest part of the domain driving southerly or westerly moisture fluxes anomalies fig 8 in all 8 regimes there was also an increase in moisture flux from the atlantic ocean directed toward the land fig 8 the convergence of moisture flux from the east and from the west due to low z500 anomalies during weather regimes 4 5 6 and 7 likely enhanced warm season precipitation in the region close to lake winnipeg including the west part of the hudson bay lowlands fig 5 the eastern part of the region including moose river and groundhog river watersheds was likely too far from these western low level pressures to be significantly impacted the higher moisture flux from the atlantic ocean observed in all regimes could be associated to a positive phase of the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo which was correlated to precipitation in severn watershed table 2 amo was in a warm phase during the 1995 2008 period and favored lower pressure in the western atlantic ocean hu et al 2011 similarly to our results fig 8 which could be partly responsible for the precipitation enhance in severn watershed the higher precipitation anomalies in this region during amo was also previously reported in a study focusing on north america hu et al 2011 however the link with amo must be taken with precaution as this oscillation might be an artifact of the greenhouse gases and aerosols signal mann et al 2021 the precipitation enhancement in the severn watershed could also be associated to a negative phase of ep np and pdo table 2 the 1995 2008 negative pressure anomalies observed in the north west part of our domain for some regimes fig 8 was in accordance with the negative phase of ep np characterized by negative pressure anomalies in western canada and positive anomalies in eastern canada cpc 2020 previous works have demonstrated an association between wetter conditions in this region and a negative phase of pdo hu and huang 2009 and also a link between ep np and pdo schulte and lee 2017 therefore it is likely that the association between precipitation and pdo was driven through the ep np atmospheric pattern the association between pdo and streamflow was already found in previous studies déry and wood 2005 durocher et al 2019 but the clear link between this climate index regional atmospheric circulation and the impact on precipitation was not shown in these studies our results suggest that in the 1995 2008 period the eastern wind anomalies in one side and the south western wind anomalies associated to the negative pdo ep np patterns in the other side likely favored a zone of convergence and precipitation enhancement in the severn river area further research is needed to determine why the influence of the pdo ep np seems to mostly alter certain weather patterns links between streamflow and other modes of variability such as the arctic oscillation were found in previous studies déry and wood 2005 durocher et al 2019 but were not confirmed in this work this is possibly due to the reduced number of watersheds used in this work while the previous studies investigated larger areas and watersheds in the northern part of the hudson bay complex our study suggests that even watersheds geographically close such as severn and moose river watersheds have variable links with large scale modes of variability showing the need to investigate separately different portions of the hudson bay lowlands area 4 3 alternate explanations in the variability of streamflow after wetter conditions in the 1995 2008 period for the severn river area the precipitation was decreased in the 2009 2019 period likely due to a reversal of the processes described in section 4 2 fig 9 however the observed streamflow remained relatively large and the simulated streamflow was not able to recreate this high streamflow in the windigo river watershed fig 4c one explanation can be a delay between the increase in precipitation and the increase in streamflow in the 2000s period of high precipitation in severn area the simulations in windigo river show high streamflow compared to observations available in the area whereas in the 2010s the simulations are lower than observations fig 4c this result suggests a too quick response of simulated streamflow to the increase in precipitation likely associated to a groundwater recharge discharge process not well simulated by mesh this interpretation is supported by the results from fig 4a showing the recent years underestimation occurring mostly in winter period when groundwater discharge represents most of the overall streamflow the inability of mesh to properly simulate groundwater recharge discharge process was possibly due to the recent global warming indeed evidence of increased winter base flow in subarctic regions also observed in our study fig 2 have been previously associated with permafrost thaw st jacques and sauchyn 2009 song et al 2020 evans et al 2020 qin et al 2020 the thickening of the active layer associated with permafrost thaw was likely increasing hydrogeologic connectivity between rivers and aquifers enhancing groundwater circulation lamontagne hallé et al 2018 a recent study in the hudson bay lowlands region confirmed a clear relationship between the warming and an increase in hydrogeologic conductivity enhancing winter baseflow wang 2019 the warming observed in the 1995 2008 period not shown likely enhanced the groundwater recharge mainly in areas affected by permafrost such as severn river department of energy mines and resources canada 1995 it is likely that permafrost played a role but whether the change was due to the release of frozen water trapped in the permafrost for a long period or due to the increase in hydraulic conductivity accelerating groundwater recharge and discharge remains unclear a better representation of the link between active layers and groundwater discharge will be needed in future simulations another difference between severn and moose rivers area could be associated with river regime regulation of moose river there are however several arguments against this hypothesis first regulation mostly changes the seasonality of streamflow déry et al 2018 but should not impacts long term trend of annual flow volume déry et al 2011 mcclelland et al 2006 second the interannual variability of streamflow in the groundhog river watershed moose river tributary was recreated by the model at the beginning and the end of the study period showing that calibrated parameters consistently recreated streamflow over the entire period finally another moose river tributary that is not regulated the missinaibi river has similar change of streamflow compared to the regulated groundhog river fig 2 5 conclusion the main objective of this study was to investigate the impact of atmospheric circulation on the inter decadal evolution of streamflow in the hudson bay lowlands given the large amount of missing hydrometric data streamflow has been simulated in the 1979 2019 period in two watersheds in the west and east part of the studied region using mesh hydrological model fed with era5 reanalysis data to investigate how atmospheric circulation impacted streamflow in this region we identified z500 based weather regimes as recurrent weather patterns in a large area of eastern north america by identifying the precipitation amount associated with each weather regime and the yearly occurrence of weather regimes we investigated if the inter decadal change of precipitation and streamflow was due to the change of occurrence of weather regimes or a change in their intrinsic characteristics the results can be summarized as follow 1 the streamflow was satisfactorily simulated by mesh in both watersheds and each was well representative of other watersheds in the west and east part of the studied region 2 a higher streamflow in the 1995 2008 period was simulated in the western watershed due to a change in intrinsic conditions of several weather regime patterns mainly higher precipitation driven by higher convergence of soil moisture flux 3 the higher convergence of moisture flux in the 1995 2008 period was associated with low pressure anomalies around lake winnipeg driven by a negative phase of pdo and ep np and by a general increase in moisture flux from the atlantic ocean 4 in the most recent period 2009 2018 moisture flux convergence decreased again reducing precipitation and simulated streamflow in the western region but the observed streamflow remained relatively high likely associated to an increase in groundwater discharge activated by permafrost degradation despite high confidence in the hydrological simulations performed in the two watersheds and their representativeness in the west and east part of the studied region these results could benefit from comparison with other hydrological models adapted to the arctic region bui et al 2020 and applied to more watersheds in the area future works should also focus on understanding the alteration of specific weather patterns during the negative phase of pdo and ep np changing regionally the amount of precipitation the specific mechanism for the origin of the relatively high streamflow in the recent period likely associated with permafrost also needs further investigations nevertheless mesh calibration performed in these two subarctic watersheds gives an opportunity to estimate the future change of streamflow in a region that is very sensitive to climate change funding this study was funded by natural resources canada canada centre for remote sensing and the

8214,study region this study focuses on the twelfth largest lake in sweden lake bolmen and its catchment study focus during the last decades the process of brownification has resulted in water with browner color affecting water quality and ecosystems the occurrence of brownification and its governing factors especially with regard to the interaction with the environment is not yet fully understood this study therefore performed different statistical analysis to detect spatial and temporal patterns in brown color and associated forcing factors in addition models were developed to describe the water flows in the lake and their influence on the water color new hydrological insights for the region seasonal variations in color are dominated by meteorological parameters such as precipitation and temperature whereas long term decadal variations are functions of trends in these parameters as well as changes in land use primarily related to forestry modeling the water flows yielded the residence time for different sub basins in the lake indicating the effects of travel time on the color calculated wind generated surface waves and their effects on resuspension showed that such events may occur on a limited event and time scale keywords brownification lake hydrology climate and land use change catchment properties drinking water production 1 introduction brownification is an ongoing process in many fresh and brackish waters resulting in water with a browner color it is mainly occurring in the northern hemisphere and causes a variety of changes to the water quality and ecosystems kritzberg 2017 lebret et al 2018 nydahl et al 2019 although brownification typically is a natural process the brown colored water may have some perceived negative effects on for example tourism because of decreased recreational value keeler et al 2015 or the water body as a source for water supply since it increases treatment costs the brown water color is presumed to be related to the rising content of dissolved organic substances mainly organic carbon compounds in the water bodies leaching from nearby soils rich in humic acids graneli 2012 research regarding brownification started in connection with its discovery in the late 1960s due to its complexity and the relatively young research field the governing processes are not fully understood and specific causes for it cannot yet be completely determined ekström 2013 köhler et al 2013 creed et al 2018 different factors responsible for the increase of brown colored water have been investigated of which precipitation and temperature have been identified as the most influential meteorological parameters determining the seasonality of water browning temnerud et al 2014 kritzberg et al 2019 it has been demonstrated that wetter climate causes higher magnitudes in color and a dryer climate lower meyer jacob et al 2019 a declining deposition of atmospheric sulfur and its effects on increased iron mobility is also a potentially contributing source to brown color in water bodies björnerås et al 2017 during recent decades land use has changed dramatically in many catchments and coniferous forest areas have gained importance approaching an agriculture like status this development has significantly influenced the carbon cycle since higher amounts of biomass are produced in coniferous rich areas which effects the carbon budged of water bodies in such catchments presumably resulting in increased brown color temnerud et al 2014 finstad et al 2016 škerlep et al 2019 however it is not yet clear if the increase in color is actually a return to a more natural stage of rivers and lakes before the effects of industrialization became prominent which might also explain the limited research about this specific topic carried out in the southern hemisphere monteith et al 2007 descriptive naming of many rivers and lakes dating back in history especially in scandinavia for example rödvattnet i e red water in swedish supports this theory however findings by kritzberg 2017 show that a rapid increase in sulfur deposition between 1935 and 1982 did actually not result in higher color values which counteracts this theory the basic mechanisms of brownification are expected to be similar in a global perspective temnerud et al 2014 however each catchment has specific characteristics that influence the process of browning differently with regard to the relative importance of these mechanisms therefore it is essential to understand the relationship between specific catchment properties and brown colored water in a lake besides the input of water and material from the catchment the brown color will be affected by different processes including sedimentation resuspension and various biological and chemical processes also the transport and mixing of the material in the lake will give rise to spatial and temporal variations in color that is a function of the hydrodynamics for example the mean circulation and the turbulent fluctuations which determine the local diffusion of material water movement in a lake is typically induced by wind either directly or through the generation of surface waves the presence of such waves may cause resuspension since the shear stress on the bottom under oscillatory flow is much larger than for a steady current created by the wind as the water gets browner the temperature will rise because of increased heat absorption also affecting the location of the thermocline in deeper lakes graneli 2012 such a temperature increase may influence the ecosystem inside and around the lake and its quantification is an important measure to understand the overall influences research has shown that a higher color content can have negative effect on the live expectations of specific fish species hedström et al 2017 which can change an ecosystem markedly thus the productivity and composition of the community in such ecosystems can be negatively influenced and lead to long term changes creed et al 2018 eventually causing drastic alterations inside the food web systems of affected surface waters taipale et al 2016 the present study focuses on lake bolmen located in southern sweden that entails a high value for recreation and is also an important resource for water supply lake bolmen is highly affected by water browning and it has experienced an increase in color of about 50 during the last 40 years these changes are recognized since colors have been measured in the lake according to the apha hazen scale since the late 1930s the apha hazen scale was introduced by allen hazen in the end of the 19th century the color of a water sample is measured by comparison with defined standard solutions of cobalt and platinum hazen 1896 the hydrology of its catchment as well as the hydrodynamics of the lake has only been sparsely studied thus the physical processes and their effects on the brownification of the lake are not well known a better understanding regarding the interrelationship of different processes governing the hydrology and hydrodynamics of this water body and its catchment are important to ensure its water quality for future generations persson 2011 knowledge on brownification in lake bolmen will also help to improve drinking water production for almost 600 000 people in the southern most part of sweden since lake bolmen is one of the main drinking water resources for this area brown colored water requires higher efforts if used for drinking water since it affects the treatment process negatively in general organic matter is removed during the flocculation or membrane filtering process depending on the raw water quality with higher amounts of organic matter filters need to be back washed more frequently or higher amounts of coagulants are needed which results in higher costs and increased amount of sludge during the treatment process löfgren et al 2003 lidén 2016 keucken et al 2017 being able to adjust the treatment processes for the expected raw water quality in the best case ahead of time will help to make drinking water production more resilient and sustainable measures such as adjusting the coagulant dosing could be activated earlier to allow a more consistent water quality and to simplify the treatment procedure which would save money and other efforts in lake bolmen and its tributaries the level of browning exhibits spatial and temporal changes on scales from the local to the regional as well as from single events to seasons and years the water color gradually changes from north to south with lower levels of color in the southern part also how the water color inside lake bolmen will change in the future and which type of optimizations could be implemented regarding the drinking water treatment process need to be investigated in further detail with regard to various climate scenarios this in turn requires a quantitative understanding of the physical processes affecting brownification increasing levels of browning above a certain limit could make it necessary to exploit new sources for water supply as drinking water production from existing sources may no longer be feasible the main objective of the present study is to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of color in lake bolmen and relate it to the governing processes this will be accomplished by 1 analyzing temporal and spatial variability of color measurements in lake bolmen and its tributaries 2 establishing relationships between color and related parameters that characterize natural and man induced processes in the catchment and in the lake besides color the focus is on physical parameters such as precipitation temperature and land use as well as a wide range of other water quality parameters all parameters included in the analysis are potentially regarded as being related to water browning both as a result of natural and anthropogenic changes the analysis involved a number of different statistical methods further discussed in section 4 to quantify the spatial and temporal properties of the data together with their inter relationships the knowledge gained can potentially be used to estimate the changes in brown color of lakes as a result of changes in parameter values under different climatic conditions water chemistry measurements dating back to the early 1980s form the foundation for this study based on the hypothesis that long term trends here taken as the decadal scale in water color are driven by changes in meteorological processes for example precipitation and air temperature and land use whereas seasonal variations are determined primarily by meteorological processes the data set on water chemistry was complemented with relevant environmental data thus it was possible to determine relationships between different parameters and their influence on the brownification process in lake bolmen however due to data limitations not all relevant processes could be investigated at the same detail which indicates the need for future measurements and field campaigns in the lake and its catchment 2 lake bolmen sweden the focus of this study is lake bolmen located in southern sweden see fig 1 it is the largest lake in the lagan river basin and with a surface area of 173 km2 it constitutes sweden s twelfth largest lake sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2008 the swedish agency for marine and water management classifies lake bolmen as a natural lake with good ecological and chemical status although it fails to achieve good chemical status for some specific measurements vatteninformationssystem sverige 2019 however during the last decades an increasing trend regarding water color has been recognized in the lake as well as in its tributaries see fig 2 a hydropower plant operated by the norwegian company statkraft is located at the lake outlet in skeen producing 14 gwh electricity annually statkraft sverige 2008 the flow at the lake outlet is regulated smoothing the natural water level variations in lake bolmen and making the lake level fluctuating around 141 4 meter above sea level with a typical annual amplitude of ca 1 m 2 1 the catchment of lake bolmen the catchment of the lake consists of 87 subcatchments covering an area of 1650 km2 that stretches over seven municipalities and is dominated by forest ca 64 and wetlands ca 8 5 out of the forest 18 to 20 is between 41 to 60 years old and most of the area is used commercial swedish university of agricultural sciences 2020 the largest wetland 8000 ha store mosse in the bolmen catchment is located about 25 km north of the lake the population density in the catchment is 20 6 inhabitants per km2 which is lower than the average population density of sweden 24 5 inhabitants km2 statistikmyndigheten 2020 since urban areas cover less than one percent of the catchment no significant industrial activities take place and the most important industries are fishing and outdoor tourism plette 2019 the bolmen catchment is part of the lagan river catchment which is one the 22 main catchments of sweden sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2020b 2 2 the lake and its tributaries the main tributaries to lake bolmen are the two rivers lillån and storån in the north together with the outflow from lake unnen called lidhultsån on the western side of the lake many other small rivers and creeks e g dannäsån smedjebäcken torarpsviken and murån are located around lake bolmen and contribute to the lake water inflow to a smaller degree see fig 1 a simplified water balance was established for lake bolmen based on available information about the in and outflows on a long term basis the sum of the in and outflows should be zero any deviations may indicate lack of knowledge regarding certain water balance components the inflows include the main tributaries from the sub catchments and the precipitation over the lake whereas the outflows consist of the tributary bolmån at the southern end of the lake water extracted to the bolmen tunnel used for water supply and the evaporation the inflows from the tributaries was based on the nationwide hydrological model of sweden s hype from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi whereas the outflows are measured at the power station in skeen bolmån and the tunnel the estimated terms in the water balance can be found in table 1 where the mean precipitation and evaporation were set to 860 and 500 mm year respectively small and very small tributaries are not taken into account by the s hype model and therefore the sum of inflows does not exactly correspond to the outflows also in the water balance groundwater was not included assuming that the groundwater in and outflows are similar it is expected that the obtained deviation from zero in the balance of about 14 is mainly related to the uncertainties in the s hype model the 42 km2 large island bolmsö in the center of the lake divides it into five parts with different hydrodynamic properties governed by the inflow from respective tributaries bathymetric conditions shoreline configuration and fetch length for wind generated currents and waves see fig 13 in addition several smaller islands are situated inside the lake resulting in complex water movement and mixing conditions but also in high biological diversity vatteninformationssystem sverige 2019 the northwestern sub basin of the lake is dominated by the two main tributaries storån and lillån and it has a maximum depth of 10 m whereas the northeastern sub basin is significantly shallower with an average depth of 3 m the latter part of the lake shows less depth variations and the inflow is dominated by the river dannäsån the eastern part of lake bolmen is very narrow and generally quite shallow with a number of deep areas reaching 21 m at the small village tannåker the lake is the narrowest and the distance between the island bolmsö and the mainland is not more than 200 m on the western side the lake is in average almost twice as wide compared to the eastern part but with less variations in depth the deepest point in the western part is situated just east of the tiraholm peninsula 28 m most of the water volume is contained in the southern part of the lake where also the deepest point 38 m is located lake bolmen has a retention time of about 1 6 years and the majority of the net flow occurs along the western part of the lake in general bolmen is quite shallow for its size with an average depth of 6 2 m a bathymetric map of the lake can be found in fig 1 even though bolmen overall is quite shallow the lake may become stratified during summer a certain locations according to hamrin 1979 lake bolmen exhibited a thermocline during most summers between 1966 and 1975 at water depths of 7 to 10 m in the northern part and between water depths of 10 and 15 m in the southern part stratification developed more often in the southern part because of larger depths here besides its value for recreation sydvatten ab uses the lake as resource for drinking water production distributing water to 12 municipalities in southwestern sweden a 80 km long tunnel with an cross sectional area of 9 m2 transports around 1400 l s of lake water at free surface flow conditions south where it is treated at the ringsjö water treatment plant and subsequently distributed to the consumers the maximum withdrawal quantity was estimated based on the expected population growth at the time of the tunnel construction in the 1960s and the limit is set by law to 6000 l s sydvatten 2019 2 3 climate according to the köppen climate classification lake bolmen and its catchment is part of the humid continental climate zone without a dry season and warm summers peel et al 2007 several meteorological measurement stations operated by smhi are located inside the catchment the yearly mean temperature is 7 0 c with the highest temperatures occurring during the summer month total annual precipitations amounts to 675 900 mm a with higher precipitation values in the northwestern parts of the catchment sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2019 fig 3 a shows the average monthly temperature and precipitation between 1969 to 2019 for the city of ljungby located about 10 km south east of the catchment an overview of the wind climate for the same location is given in fig 3b the majority of the winds blow from southwest but occasionally strong winds occur with a northern wind direction according to smhi the average start of different seasons vary within sweden and between years but for the studied catchment typical dates are for winter the 15th of december spring the 15th of march summer the 20th of may and autumn at 25th of september sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2017 these dates will be used in the present study to define the seasons employed in the analysis 3 data different sources were employed to compile the data utilized in this paper an overview of the locations of the sampling stations is shown in fig 1 in the following a brief description of the data used in the subsequent analysis will be given 3 1 main tributary and lake sampling data the local water association lagans vattenråd coordinates collects and publishes information on a range of regular water quality measurements at the main tributaries seven stations and inside lake bolmen two stations these stations are shown in fig 1 lagans vattenråd 2018 the first measurements were recorded already in 1935 and from there on further measurements have been conducted with an irregular frequency from 1982 the measurement frequency increased to be more consistent reaching an almost monthly interval for the majority of the measurement locations in 1987 the most recently established measurement station is called 518 murån byholma located in the southern part of the catchment where the first measurements were recorded 2011 at a bimonthly interval table 2 gives an overview of the measurement stations used for the present study coordination and organization of water quality measurements by lagans vattenråd ensured the same measurement standard since 1955 lagans vattenråd 2020 an overview of the available water quality parameters is given in table 3 and parameters used in the analysis are specified the main reason for selecting certain parameters for analysis is availability of data for a sufficient duration 15 years at all stations several parameters e g visibility depth iron or chlorophyll a are just measured at stations inside the lake whereas other parameters for example uv absorbance have only been recorded during the last ten years some of the selected parameters are describing the water quality in a comprehensive manner for example conductivity gives general information about the ionic content the correlation coefficient between all measured parameters and the water color was calculated using the spearman correlation coefficient the result is also given in the table overall the coefficient values obtained are quite low for many of the parameters indicating that there is limited direct relations between these parameters and color since one of the main aims of this research is to understand the relationship between color and different physical parameters in the catchment simultaneous records between the stations is a necessity which determined the selection of the marked parameters in the table 3 2 meteorological data measurements of meteorological data are conducted by smhi all over sweden and can be downloaded as station wise date time series three meteorological stations are located inside the bolmen catchment measuring precipitation air temperature and relative humidity measurements concerning precipitation are available on a monthly basis dating back until may 1886 whereas records of air temperature and humidity exists from august 1995 also on a monthly basis moreover smhi conducts measurement concerning ions in precipitation which were used to analyze acid deposition and ionic changes none of this measurement stations are located directly in the catchment but three stations are within close distance to the catchment boarders although the precipitation measured outside the catchment does not reach lake bolmen it is assumed that the content of ions are similar over a large area and these measurements are representative for the study area the air quality depends on the conditions in large scale air masses thus this assumption should be valid these measurements are part of the nationwide air quality control program of sweden naturvårdsverket 2020 smhi provides simulated hydrological data on a nationwide basis with the model called s hype however the reliability of the derived data may vary depending on the possibility to locally calibrate and validate the model in the case of the tributaries to lake bolmen no data are available concerning the runoff to the lake thus some of the model settings are based on nearby catchments with similar properties this should be kept in mind when these flows are referred to in the analysis the best proxy to runoff is precipitation making the latter parameter useful in the analysis as a substitute to modeled runoff data 3 3 land use and tree species volume data regarding land use and different tree species where obtained from the swedish national forest inventory nfi conducted by the swedish agricultural university slu nfi is a yearly sample inventory performed by the department of forest resource management at slu concerning all land use classes in sweden with focus on forest development random samples are taken at both temporary and permanent stations nilsson et al 2018 the data used for this research is at the county län level the catchment of lake bolmen is shared by three counties jönköpings län kronobergs län and hallands län jönköpings län includes the northern part of the catchment with the largest share of 62 whereas kronobergs län in the south has a share of 28 and hallands län in the west a share of 10 since the two main tributaries of lake bolmen are located in the northern part of the catchment land use data in jönköpings län are considered to be the most influential regarding the water quality in the lake information about specific tree species is specified five year averages whereas changes in land use are recorded yearly data from all three counties were documented for the first time in 1926 and until 1955 no further records were taken from 1955 the data is available at regular intervals data before 1955 have not been included in the analysis as the single value is not considered useful even though the lake bolmen catchment makes up only a small part inside any of the counties county wise data is regarded as representative since land use inside these three counties may be considered as almost homogeneous regarding forested land 4 methodology the brown color in lake bolmen and its tributaries varies in time and space at a wide range of scales these variations are a function of climatic and catchment related factors as well as internal processes in the water bodies having natural and anthropogenic causes the data available for analysis imply limitations to the process scale that can be investigated in the present study the focus is on seasonal to decadal long term scale the event scale days is not discussed except briefly in connection with resuspension the purpose of the data analysis was to determine the temporal and spatial patterns of the color variation in lake bolmen and its tributaries including other relevant water quality and meteorological parameters that is closely related to the forcing of water color another goal was to establish relationships between color and other variables indicating drivers for brownification thus standard statistical methods were used including measures of population properties e g mean and standard deviation and dependencies among variables e g correlation and regression spectral analysis was used to detect oscillatory components in the data sets together with their dominant frequencies in order to obtain a better understanding of the physical system of lake bolmen especially the large scale water movement some simple mathematical models of the flow were developed to complement the statistical analysis these models also included surface waves generated by wind that may cause resuspension although the time scale of such events is much shorter that the scales of interest in this study the occurrence of resuspension may influence the color over longer time periods the above mentioned data were typically recorded with different frequencies and for time series varying in length in this study the analysis was primarily performed for data between the 1st of january 1987 and the 31st of december 2018 to achieve the best possible comparability between the data series it was necessary to manipulate the data sets in order not to lose information for example generate the same measurement frequency also differing magnitudes for different parameters needed to be adjusted to enhance the possibility to detect spatial and temporal patterns and dependencies broken measurement equipment and insufficient sampling often result in missing data a common problem in most data recordings graham 2009 the data employed in this study were also affected by such shortcomings implying that missing data needed to be handled in an acceptable manner without introducing any bias thus the following steps were performed to enable comparison between seasonal and long term data in lake bolmen and its catchment first the data were resampled to seasonal intervals according to the seasons mentioned in section 2 3 resulting in a maximum of four values per year for all values except precipitation the mean of all measurements for respective season was taken as the representative value and the resampling was performed to the last day of the season for precipitation data the seasonal sum was chosen as representative value since precipitation reflects the flow that governs the transport and should therefore be considered accumulated if a station did not have any values during a particular season no resampling could be made and the value for this season was marked as missing no resampling was performed for the land use and forest development data since the sampling period for these data is one year the method of resampling did also help to mitigate the amount of missing values in the data to be analyzed since just four instead of twelve values were necessary to complete a year then the data were standardized which results in a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 standardization has been performed using the following formula x x x σ hereby stands x for the standardized value x for the seasonal mean values x for the mean of the whole measurement series and σ for the standard deviation the resampling did not always result in four values per year since at some stations measurements were only conducted during the summer months different analysis methods e g frequency analysis require sampling at a fixed frequency without missing data making it necessary to interpolate between existing data points data series with such properties were obtained using interpolation filling the missing data using a linear approach that considered the actual time gap between recorded values however it is important to note that such analysis of interpolated times series can only provide information on frequencies that are lower than the typical sampling frequency long term trends have been analyzed using locally weighted regression also called loess or lowess cleveland and devlin 1988 using a yearly frequency to allow for comparison with land use and forest development data for the long term trend analysis of meteorological data the aforementioned data cleansing processes were omitted since smhi already provides pre treated data sets the data analysis was carried out using the scipy and scikit learn librarys for python3 scipy offers a comprehensive set of functions concerning applied statistics and scikit learn is a set of libraries for machine learning algorithms 5 results and discussion as previously mentioned water browning exhibits varying behavior in time and space depending on the forcing factors and the general environmental conditions thus an analysis of temporal and spatial patterns of water color and related parameters will yield insights to the physical processes controlling brownification the data set analyzed encompassed measurements of color over three decades in lake bolmen and its main tributaries as well as water quality meteorological and land use parameters the resolution of the data made it possible to determine seasonal and long term patterns in the color and the other parameters in the following the results of such analyses are presented and discussed considering different time and space scales 5 1 spatial variability since lake bolmen is a large lake with an extension from north to south of about 35 km spatial variations in water quality are expected during the passage of a river through the catchment it acts as a transport medium for dissolved and particulate matter where changes in the water quality reflects the local catchment characteristics for lake bolmen and its catchment almost all water quality parameters show variations in space with higher concentrations in the northern parts and lower concentrations in the southern parts the highest concentrations are commonly measured at the two main tributaries storån and lillån discharging their water into northern lake bolmen the difference between north and south is particular noticeable when comparing the color values between the different stations see fig 4 an exception to the trend is the tributary murån located in the southern part of the catchment which has an average of 270 mg pt l a reason for the much higher value from murån might be the particular conditions prevailing in this catchment in addition the shorter measurement period the first measurements were conducted in 2011 implies that the record was taken when the color magnitude experienced an increasing tendency the average color during the analyzed period 1987 2018 for the main tributaries storån and lillån are 176 mg pt l and 217 mg pt l respectively the outflowing water of lake bolmen is significantly lower with an average of 70 mg pt l for the same period the spatial variation of color is comparable to other water pollutants such as total nitrogen and total phosphorous which show decreasing magnitudes from north to south the highest total nitrogen and total phosphorous values were measured in lillån with an average of about 1100 μg l total nitrogen and 45 μg l total phosphorous oxygen shows similar values for the tributaries 10 12 mg l but lower values inside the lake 5 9 mg l the lowest oxygen concentration was measured at the bottom of the lake at the station 510 bolmen south bottom followed by the station 530 bolmen north bottom spatial changes in precipitation measurements are noticeable to a less extend where the measured precipitation is the lowest in the city of ljungby with an average for the considered period 1995 2019 of 719 mm year for the station kävsjö the annual average precipitation is 831 mm year and for bolmen 866 mm year a similar behavior was observed for the concentrations of ions in the precipitation which show minor spatial changes the highest concentration of sulfate in precipitation has been measured in aneboda which is located circa 50 km east of the northern part of lake bolmen the ratio of productive forest land differs little between the three counties covering the bolmen catchment and all forests are dominated by spruce and pine trees fig 9 shows that the total amount of forest area is largest in jönköping county due to the much larger total area of this county within the catchment halland county has the smallest amount of mixed coniferous forest but the highest amount of spruce forest area the smallest share of spruce forest with a mean of about 44 is recorded in jönköping county which is mainly located in the northern part of the catchment broadleaf tree forest plays a minor role whereof halland county has the highest share with 10 of productive forest land differences in residence time and land use influence the color magnitude of the outflowing water quality of a subcatchments the water from the tributary lidhultsån originates from lake unnen on the western side showing lower magnitudes in color compared to the river murån discharging into the southern part both sub catchments are similar in size but the lidhutlsån catchment has almost 20 more water areas than the murån catchment which is dominated by wetlands as the volume of lakes is usually higher than the volume of a wetlands for the same surface area the retention time of a lake is longer than the one of a wetland a longer retention time promotes sedimentation of organic content as well as the action of biological and chemical processes which results in lower magnitudes of color a similar observation have been made by temnerud et al 2014 for different catchments all over sweden and for industrial applications using natural systems in the cleaning processes of water by svensson et al 2015 however this only seems to be case for larger streams as this results are contradictory to research performed across 17 smaller low order streams kothawala et al 2015 for sub catchments with a higher share in agriculture land e g lillån river the correlation between total phosphorous and water color shows a higher value r 2 0 55 which indicates that agricultural practices impact the water color also this result is an indication that the agricultural activities in this sub catchment is dominated by animal farming instead of crop growing since it has been demonstrated that animal husbandry generate higher phosphorous flows linderholm 2012 even though the volume of lake bolmen is large about 1 1 km3 with regard to the inflows and may be able to buffer changes in water quality for an appreciable time the water quality of the tributaries will to a large degree define the lake water quality 5 2 seasonal variability distinct seasonal changes occur for all water quality parameters the highest water color is typically measured during the summer season and the annual variation in color differs markedly between measurement locations in the magnitude of 50 to 100 an exception to this seasonal behavior was observed at measurement station 520 unnens outflow located in the river lidhultsån where the average water color is the highest in winter and the lowest during summer the water temperature shows the most significant changes varying during the year in a range of 15 c with summer showing the highest temperatures as all water temperature measurements have been conducted 0 5 m below the water surface except for the stations 530 bolmen north bottom and 510 bolmen south bottom the temperature is highly related to the air temperature for the stations 530 bolmen north 530 bolmen north bottom 510 bolmen south and 510 bolmen south bottom no analysis of seasonal variations could be performed since all measurements are conducted during summer other parameters with the seasonal maximum in summer are alkalinity total phosphorus ph toc and turbidity total nitrogen reaches the yearly maximum during the spring and the yearly minimum in summer which is the same for oxygen the higher amount of total nitrogen is most likely related to increased fertilization as a result of seed bed preparation the highest precipitations occurs during summer see fig 3 which is also the season with the highest air temperatures fig 5 shows the spectral analysis for a number of parameters for the last 20 years at the station 550 storåns outflow into bolmen which was chosen for analysis since it includes the most comprehensive data set available analysis done on a monthly basis all parameters show a clear spike at the frequency of 1 year 1 which corresponds to the annual variation a larger number of smaller spikes are visible with frequencies higher than once per year but no particular pattern emerges for the parameters studied this indicates that these parameters are primary drivers for the seasonal variation in color both in the lake and in the tributaries as observed kritzberg et al 2019 the toc follows the color closely displaying the same seasonal pattern changes in total phosphorous load the ph of the water body and the ph of the precipitation influence seasonal changes of the water color the lower ph during winter and spring results in a higher mobility for organic matter which subsequently gets washed out with increased precipitation during summer resulting in higher color magnitude during this season the increased ph inside the lake might be the result higher precipitation as well since the measured values indicate a higher ph in precipitation than the lake water furthermore seasonal changes in lake water ph are affected of the internal metabolism of the lake ecosystems during warmer seasons the biological activity of algae is higher resulting in increased co2 uptake and an increase in ph during the summer schindler et al 1972 tank et al 2009 5 3 long term variability this section focuses on long term variabilities and trends here a differentiation is made between the time period for detailed water quality measurements 1987 2018 and other measurements available for a longer time period if not stated otherwise long term in the context of this section discusses the time between late 1980s and 2018 the tributaries flowing into lake bolmen are of varying size where storån river in the northwestern part of the lake is by far the largest contributor according to sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2020b it supplies in average 9 4 m3 s water to bolmen followed by the second and third largest contributors lidhultsån river with 3 2 m3 s and lillån river with 2 5 m3 s respectively storån and lillån both join bolmen in the north western part and contribute about 83 5 of the color into lake bolmen the flow of this contributing rivers is predominantly controlled by runoff determined by precipitation over each subcatchment an increase in the total annual precipitation as well as days with extreme precipitation have been noticed since the 1950s and these trends are continuing see fig 6 a day is regarded as having an extreme precipitation event if the daily sum of the precipitation is higher than the upper 95 percentile more than 10 5 mm day of all other precipitation events in 2015 smhi published a similar analysis for whole sweden which considered a daily precipitation of more than 40 mm day as extreme sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2015 according to this latter criterion a yearly extreme event would happen to a much less extent however it can be noticed that the return period of such events significantly decreased with time the annual total precipitation has increased by almost 100 mm year over the past 60 years and the number of extremes events more than 10 5 mm day by three to four times higher precipitation should affect the inflow to lake bolmen from the subcatchments however the annual mean outflow has not changed since 1950 and there is not trend in the lake water level in contrast an increase in events with higher than usual flows can be observed see fig 7 a similar trend is noticeable in long term temperature trends in the catchment the yearly mean temperature has increased by about 1 5 c over the past 60 years and the amount of days with extreme temperature events has almost tripled see fig 8 a day with an average temperature higher than 17 3 c is considered as day with extreme temperature whereby this temperature represents the upper 95 percentile of the analyzed measurements due to higher annual mean temperatures evaporation above lake bolmen should increase which may also explain that the outflow from the lake has remained constant however the number of extreme temperature and precipitation events show large variations between years for the analyzed period these results are in agreement with the long term climate analysis performed by smhi sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2020a precipitation and temperature are main indicators for climate variations and lead to changes of the catchment hydrology which may have major impact on the water quality forest development also shows significant changes with time and the total area of forest has increased in the range 75 to 100 fig 9 shows the increase in volume and the share between different species inside the counties that encompasses the bolmen catchment especially the amount of spruce shows a higher increase compared to pine and birch trees this is because almost 60 of the swedish forest is used commercially and spruce is the dominant tree in these forests due to its high yield the royal swedish academy of agriculture and forestry 2015 the data presented in fig 12 implies that long term changes in color are highly related to birch volume in the catchment but it is important to notice that birch has a small share in the bolmen catchment and therefore the influence of birch might not be significant the increase in forest land shows significant changes regarding the share of mires a decrease is noticeable since the 1960s but it reaches a more stable share in the late 1980s from 2002 a large increase in dead wood and a decrease in productive forests are noticeable for all three counties with a maximum increase of up to 300 this increase is due to heavy storm damage caused by the cyclone gudrun in 2005 södra 2018 in addition to increasing yearly mean temperature and annual precipitation all water quality parameters show different long term trends despite spatial variation between the measurement stations discussed in section 5 1 certain general behaviors regarding the long term development for these parameters have been observed the average magnitude of the water color has increased significantly during the last 60 years see fig 2 for the station 520 unnens outflow the annual average color changed from 63 mg pt l in 1987 to 152 mg pt l in 2012 and for the station 540 lillån outflow into bolmen from 196 mg pt l to 230 mg pt l as mentioned previously spatial differences occur and the largest increase in color was measured in the southern part of lake bolmen the stations in the northern part of the lake show in general higher water color magnitudes in the range 50 to 100 compared to the southern part however since 2008 the trends have changed implying decrease for the northern stations from 2012 decreases can also be observed in the southern part of the lake this decrease indicates a slow down in the brownification process although the general magnitude is still much higher than 60 years ago to more firmly deduce the cause behind this recent development to ensure that it is not only a response to short term climate variability and changes in catchment conditions further analysis of future measurements need to be conducted fig 10 shows the long term trends of color at different stations using a local weighted regression with a period of one year the difference δ between the annual color maximum and minimum range shows considerable variations between years δ 25 to 250 mg pt l depending on year and station years with a higher annual average color also have larger ranges and conversely years with a lower annual average have smaller ranges the long term trend in the range shows no significant change except for the station 508 murån where the amplitude decreases δ 400 mg pt l in 2012 to δ 50 mg pt l in 2018 the stability of the range shows that the overall magnitude of color has increased in recent years not just the annual maxima a similar behavior is observed for total organic carbon toc which is to be expected since color and toc are known for their high correlation and toc is often used as a proxy for water color finstad et al 2016 however this correlation may not be apparent at other locations in sweden where brownification has been observed temnerud et al 2014 conductivity displays a contrasting behavior to water color where higher color values coincides with lower conductivity as demonstrated by the negative spearmen correlation coefficient such a relationship has been shown by eikebrokk et al 2018 of interest is the time shifted correlation between both total nitrogen and total phosphorous and water color particularly in sub catchments dominated by agriculture e g for the river lillån the lake ph shows a positive trend of ca 0 5 ph units during the last 60 years for all measurement stations this increase in lake water ph may be related to a general ph increase as a result of the recovery from acid rain however further investigations of how the changes in lake ph are related to changes in the environment are needed the average yearly temperature in all tributaries shows no significant increase during the measurement period however a positive trend is noticeable for the measurements performed in summer resulting in an increase of up to 3 c during the period for this season the higher water temperature is most likely the result of increasing air temperature as previously pointed out continued rise in the average air temperature as well as increasing days of extreme temperature will cause the lake water temperature during summer to further increase this will not just effect the stratification of the lake but also have significant impact on the flora and fauna rasconi et al 2015 already today an increasing amount of chlorophyll a particularly in the northern part of the lake has been observed however a noticeable increase in cyanobacteria has not yet been detected borgström 2020 an increasing ph is the most significant change occurring in the precipitation for all three stations with an increase of about 0 5 to 1 ph units in addition the level of sulfate content in the precipitation has significantly decreased dropping to levels below 1 mg l in general changes regarding ion concentration of the precipitation are similar at the different locations but aneboda shows the most absolute noticeable changes due to the significantly longer measurement period the decline in sulfur deposition and increase in ph of precipitation is in line with results shown by björnerås et al 2017 and may be related to declining influences from industrialization yearly average water and air temperature show both and increase in magnitude with the highest increase during the summer months in contrast the yearly mean humidity decreased about 1 during ten years indicating higher evaporation rates several long term trends including the discussed above are illustrated in fig 11 for the station 510 bolmen south as before the trends are emphasized by using the locally weighted regression also to allow for more easy comparison the data has been standardized the long term increase in water color and organic carbon might be the result of different human induced changes in the catchment one such change is the increase in productive forest land dominated by spruce which also has resulted in a decrease of mires however the effects on the water quality exhibits a significant time lag before changes appear which is illustrated in fig 12 specifically when looking at changes in spruce volume and water color it is assumed that the majority of carbon inside lake bolmen is of allochthone origin introduced from the catchment and a much smaller part derives from biological processes inside the lake this assumption needs to be proven with further research which requires detailed measurements regarding carbon flows inside the lake and along the main tributaries moreover the increase in annual precipitation and mean temperature will further promote the trend of increasing color specifically regarding yearly extremes since seasonal changes of color magnitudes are governed by temperature and precipitation this assumption is in agreement with earlier findings de wit et al 2016 weyhenmeyer et al 2016 to summarize on the decadal scale the color in lake bolmen has increased substantially although in recent years a marked decrease has been observed the precipitation and temperature have increased simultaneously whereas the sulphate resulting mainly from atmospheric deposition has decreased all these changes tend to produce more brown color in the water and thus it is likely that the long term brownification is a result of these developments the forest area has increased during the last decades up until the major storm gudrun hit in 2005 devastating large areas with forest this increase could also have contributed to the brownification during several decades however after the storm occurred the reduction in forest activities may have influenced the color causing the observed decrease thus when the forestry has restored its capacity an increase in color is expected as the meteorological parameters most likely will continue to follow their increasing trends 5 4 lake flows the short term flows in the lake determining the color distribution at the event scale is primarily generated by the wind either directly through wind induced currents or indirectly through surface waves which in turn generate currents at the bed on a long term basis the water movement and exchange is governed by the through flow as given by the tributaries to the lake in this study the focus is on seasonal and long term color patterns and their drivers thus the short term transport and mixing by the wind is not discussed however some calculations of the wave conditions at different locations in the lake were made to assess the potential for resuspension if such events occur frequently then the mean color may be impacted even on a longer time scale the shoreline configuration and bathymetry of lake bolmen are relatively complex affecting the water movement and exchange the main inflows to the lake is located in the northwestern part and the outflow at the most southern point in order to estimate the large scale flow pattern through the lake as well as the lake residence time the lake was divided into five sub basins as shown in fig 13 to estimate the flow between the sub basins the constrictions between these basins were described using open channel flow including minor losses at the entrance and exit the constrictions were taken to have rectangular cross sections and the geometry was obtained from bathymetric maps the manning roughness n was set equal to n 0 03 at all constrictions and the minor loss coefficient were given standard values from the hydraulic literature through continuity equations for each sub basin and energy equations for water particles being transported either west or east of bolmsö the unknown flows q between the basins could be calculated q 1 to q 5 see fig 13 which in turn was the basis for estimating the residence time for each basin a water particle moving through both the northern and southern parts would spend an extra time of 12 18 months in the lake compared to only moving through the most southern part based on the mean flow conditions this estimate is based on a simple translation through the basin due to the net flow without including any mixing the result of the analysis is shown in table 4 where three different inflow conditions have been investigated minimum mean and maximum of the annual mean inflows from the tributaries the calculations show that for all three inflow conditions 80 of the water flow is transported along the western side of the lake which will have implications for the long term transport and mixing in the lake the residence time t for each sub basin is displayed in table 5 defined as t v q where v is the water volume of the basin and q is the through flow for the basin the parameter t was calculated for each flow condition in order to obtain a range of possible values for t the prevailing winds at lake bolmen originate from southwest see fig 3b and even though the fetches are limited surface waves can appear of a magnitude that may induce resuspension no wave measurements are available for the lake thus the waves were calculated with a model based on the smb methods coastal engineering research center 1984 modified by hanson and larson 2008 employing fetch length water depth wind direction and wind speed as input a time series of wind data from ljungby between 1996 and 2017 at 3 h resolution was used to calculate the wave climate at three sites located approximately in the north middle and south of the lake see fig 13 the model results show that the largest wave during the study period appeared at the northern point h s 0 52 m t p 2 4 s where h s is the energy based significant wave height and t p is the peak spectral period whereas at the middle point the average wave height for the entire period is the largest h s 0 06 m t p 0 8 s in shallow areas the largest waves can induce shear stresses on the bed that are sufficiently large to exceed the critical shear stress and mobilize bottom sediment calculations of the bed shear stress under oscillatory waves camenen et al 2009 was performed for a range of bed roughnesses and compared with different critical shear stresses representative for lake sediment no information is presently available about the bed conditions in lake bolmen so typical values had to be employed in these calculations for example for a bed roughness of 0 2 mm and a critical shear stress of 0 05 n m2 the mean duration of exceedance for this stress was 12 5 h year at the most northern point thus resuspension is likely to occur during higher storms but it is primarily on the event scale lake bolmen might be ice covered during january to march which will affect the wave generation and resuspension ice cover was not included in the above calculations implying that the estimates are on the conservative side overall these results indicate that that many factors affecting the brownification in lake bolmen and its tributaries are of natural origin for example precipitation and temperature and thus not possible to influence however if the increase noted in these variables are indeed a result of climate change induced by man reduction of emissions may halt the trend and the brownification the decrease in sulphate is most likely a result of such reduced emissions although this probably has had a reverse effect on the brown color the forestry is an activity that could be managed to limit its contribution to the brown color but still the connection between color and forestry practices is not well known and more data are needed to clarify it 6 conclusion long time series on water color in lake bolmen and its tributaries together with other water quality meteorological and land use parameters were analyzed to determine temporal and spatial patterns and their properties at the seasonal and decadal scale the inter relationships between color and the other parameters were investigated to detect drivers for brownification and to assess whether the drivers were natural or human induced a range of statistical methods were employed to determine properties of the parameters studied and their inter dependencies but also models of the flows in the lake were developed to assess the impact of these flows on the color at different scales total organic carbon can be taken as a proxy for water color showing the highest correlation with color of all water quality parameters seasonal variations could be linked mainly to changes in air temperature and precipitation which influence the transport patterns and solubility of organic matter in the catchment at the longer time scale decadal these meteorological parameters were also clear drivers of the color because of changes in climatic conditions implying higher temperature and precipitation in addition changes in land use particularly more forest land and more spruce in the forest proved to be influencing factor on the browning possibly together with changes in the sub catchment retention times the major storm gudrun in 2005 caused dramatic changes to the land use characteristics devastating large areas of forest which in turn influenced the transport of material in the tributaries and to the lake a connection between the amount of dead forest volume and color was observed where a greater amount of dead forest led to higher magnitudes of color however overall there was a decrease in color after the large changes observed in the catchment after the storm since the storm felled trees have been removed from the catchment models of the water flows in the lake and through its sub basins yielded estimates of the residence times which will influence the transport and mixing of color however a more comprehensive assessment requires additional measurements in the lake besides the two locations available at present calculations also indicated that resuspension by surface waves may occur on an event basis probably with a total duration of less than a day per year but at a shorter time scales it might be important to consider more detailed investigations of resuspension requires extensive sampling of sediment conditions at the lake bottom as well as hydrodynamic measurements of the flow conditions with continued increasing trends in precipitation and temperature in the lake bolmen catchment as well as extreme weather events the problem with water browning might increase further in the future longer and drier summers might lead to forest dieback as is the case in germany thorn et al 2019 thus the amount of transportable organic matter may increase subsequently resulting in higher magnitudes of color also shorter periods with ice cover can intensify the wave conditions and lead to more events with resuspension lake bolmen does not yet show signs of eutrophication but the trend of increasing nutrients should be analyzed in more detail in the future it might be necessary to adjust local agriculture and forest practices to mitigate nutrient transport which will help to keep a healthy trophic state for lake bolmen thus improved interaction between different stakeholders would be beneficial in order to allow for more detailed predictions of the future development in lake bolmen further measurements at higher spatial and temporal resolution are necessary and should also include hydrological information as the physical relationships controlling water browning are not

8214,study region this study focuses on the twelfth largest lake in sweden lake bolmen and its catchment study focus during the last decades the process of brownification has resulted in water with browner color affecting water quality and ecosystems the occurrence of brownification and its governing factors especially with regard to the interaction with the environment is not yet fully understood this study therefore performed different statistical analysis to detect spatial and temporal patterns in brown color and associated forcing factors in addition models were developed to describe the water flows in the lake and their influence on the water color new hydrological insights for the region seasonal variations in color are dominated by meteorological parameters such as precipitation and temperature whereas long term decadal variations are functions of trends in these parameters as well as changes in land use primarily related to forestry modeling the water flows yielded the residence time for different sub basins in the lake indicating the effects of travel time on the color calculated wind generated surface waves and their effects on resuspension showed that such events may occur on a limited event and time scale keywords brownification lake hydrology climate and land use change catchment properties drinking water production 1 introduction brownification is an ongoing process in many fresh and brackish waters resulting in water with a browner color it is mainly occurring in the northern hemisphere and causes a variety of changes to the water quality and ecosystems kritzberg 2017 lebret et al 2018 nydahl et al 2019 although brownification typically is a natural process the brown colored water may have some perceived negative effects on for example tourism because of decreased recreational value keeler et al 2015 or the water body as a source for water supply since it increases treatment costs the brown water color is presumed to be related to the rising content of dissolved organic substances mainly organic carbon compounds in the water bodies leaching from nearby soils rich in humic acids graneli 2012 research regarding brownification started in connection with its discovery in the late 1960s due to its complexity and the relatively young research field the governing processes are not fully understood and specific causes for it cannot yet be completely determined ekström 2013 köhler et al 2013 creed et al 2018 different factors responsible for the increase of brown colored water have been investigated of which precipitation and temperature have been identified as the most influential meteorological parameters determining the seasonality of water browning temnerud et al 2014 kritzberg et al 2019 it has been demonstrated that wetter climate causes higher magnitudes in color and a dryer climate lower meyer jacob et al 2019 a declining deposition of atmospheric sulfur and its effects on increased iron mobility is also a potentially contributing source to brown color in water bodies björnerås et al 2017 during recent decades land use has changed dramatically in many catchments and coniferous forest areas have gained importance approaching an agriculture like status this development has significantly influenced the carbon cycle since higher amounts of biomass are produced in coniferous rich areas which effects the carbon budged of water bodies in such catchments presumably resulting in increased brown color temnerud et al 2014 finstad et al 2016 škerlep et al 2019 however it is not yet clear if the increase in color is actually a return to a more natural stage of rivers and lakes before the effects of industrialization became prominent which might also explain the limited research about this specific topic carried out in the southern hemisphere monteith et al 2007 descriptive naming of many rivers and lakes dating back in history especially in scandinavia for example rödvattnet i e red water in swedish supports this theory however findings by kritzberg 2017 show that a rapid increase in sulfur deposition between 1935 and 1982 did actually not result in higher color values which counteracts this theory the basic mechanisms of brownification are expected to be similar in a global perspective temnerud et al 2014 however each catchment has specific characteristics that influence the process of browning differently with regard to the relative importance of these mechanisms therefore it is essential to understand the relationship between specific catchment properties and brown colored water in a lake besides the input of water and material from the catchment the brown color will be affected by different processes including sedimentation resuspension and various biological and chemical processes also the transport and mixing of the material in the lake will give rise to spatial and temporal variations in color that is a function of the hydrodynamics for example the mean circulation and the turbulent fluctuations which determine the local diffusion of material water movement in a lake is typically induced by wind either directly or through the generation of surface waves the presence of such waves may cause resuspension since the shear stress on the bottom under oscillatory flow is much larger than for a steady current created by the wind as the water gets browner the temperature will rise because of increased heat absorption also affecting the location of the thermocline in deeper lakes graneli 2012 such a temperature increase may influence the ecosystem inside and around the lake and its quantification is an important measure to understand the overall influences research has shown that a higher color content can have negative effect on the live expectations of specific fish species hedström et al 2017 which can change an ecosystem markedly thus the productivity and composition of the community in such ecosystems can be negatively influenced and lead to long term changes creed et al 2018 eventually causing drastic alterations inside the food web systems of affected surface waters taipale et al 2016 the present study focuses on lake bolmen located in southern sweden that entails a high value for recreation and is also an important resource for water supply lake bolmen is highly affected by water browning and it has experienced an increase in color of about 50 during the last 40 years these changes are recognized since colors have been measured in the lake according to the apha hazen scale since the late 1930s the apha hazen scale was introduced by allen hazen in the end of the 19th century the color of a water sample is measured by comparison with defined standard solutions of cobalt and platinum hazen 1896 the hydrology of its catchment as well as the hydrodynamics of the lake has only been sparsely studied thus the physical processes and their effects on the brownification of the lake are not well known a better understanding regarding the interrelationship of different processes governing the hydrology and hydrodynamics of this water body and its catchment are important to ensure its water quality for future generations persson 2011 knowledge on brownification in lake bolmen will also help to improve drinking water production for almost 600 000 people in the southern most part of sweden since lake bolmen is one of the main drinking water resources for this area brown colored water requires higher efforts if used for drinking water since it affects the treatment process negatively in general organic matter is removed during the flocculation or membrane filtering process depending on the raw water quality with higher amounts of organic matter filters need to be back washed more frequently or higher amounts of coagulants are needed which results in higher costs and increased amount of sludge during the treatment process löfgren et al 2003 lidén 2016 keucken et al 2017 being able to adjust the treatment processes for the expected raw water quality in the best case ahead of time will help to make drinking water production more resilient and sustainable measures such as adjusting the coagulant dosing could be activated earlier to allow a more consistent water quality and to simplify the treatment procedure which would save money and other efforts in lake bolmen and its tributaries the level of browning exhibits spatial and temporal changes on scales from the local to the regional as well as from single events to seasons and years the water color gradually changes from north to south with lower levels of color in the southern part also how the water color inside lake bolmen will change in the future and which type of optimizations could be implemented regarding the drinking water treatment process need to be investigated in further detail with regard to various climate scenarios this in turn requires a quantitative understanding of the physical processes affecting brownification increasing levels of browning above a certain limit could make it necessary to exploit new sources for water supply as drinking water production from existing sources may no longer be feasible the main objective of the present study is to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of color in lake bolmen and relate it to the governing processes this will be accomplished by 1 analyzing temporal and spatial variability of color measurements in lake bolmen and its tributaries 2 establishing relationships between color and related parameters that characterize natural and man induced processes in the catchment and in the lake besides color the focus is on physical parameters such as precipitation temperature and land use as well as a wide range of other water quality parameters all parameters included in the analysis are potentially regarded as being related to water browning both as a result of natural and anthropogenic changes the analysis involved a number of different statistical methods further discussed in section 4 to quantify the spatial and temporal properties of the data together with their inter relationships the knowledge gained can potentially be used to estimate the changes in brown color of lakes as a result of changes in parameter values under different climatic conditions water chemistry measurements dating back to the early 1980s form the foundation for this study based on the hypothesis that long term trends here taken as the decadal scale in water color are driven by changes in meteorological processes for example precipitation and air temperature and land use whereas seasonal variations are determined primarily by meteorological processes the data set on water chemistry was complemented with relevant environmental data thus it was possible to determine relationships between different parameters and their influence on the brownification process in lake bolmen however due to data limitations not all relevant processes could be investigated at the same detail which indicates the need for future measurements and field campaigns in the lake and its catchment 2 lake bolmen sweden the focus of this study is lake bolmen located in southern sweden see fig 1 it is the largest lake in the lagan river basin and with a surface area of 173 km2 it constitutes sweden s twelfth largest lake sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2008 the swedish agency for marine and water management classifies lake bolmen as a natural lake with good ecological and chemical status although it fails to achieve good chemical status for some specific measurements vatteninformationssystem sverige 2019 however during the last decades an increasing trend regarding water color has been recognized in the lake as well as in its tributaries see fig 2 a hydropower plant operated by the norwegian company statkraft is located at the lake outlet in skeen producing 14 gwh electricity annually statkraft sverige 2008 the flow at the lake outlet is regulated smoothing the natural water level variations in lake bolmen and making the lake level fluctuating around 141 4 meter above sea level with a typical annual amplitude of ca 1 m 2 1 the catchment of lake bolmen the catchment of the lake consists of 87 subcatchments covering an area of 1650 km2 that stretches over seven municipalities and is dominated by forest ca 64 and wetlands ca 8 5 out of the forest 18 to 20 is between 41 to 60 years old and most of the area is used commercial swedish university of agricultural sciences 2020 the largest wetland 8000 ha store mosse in the bolmen catchment is located about 25 km north of the lake the population density in the catchment is 20 6 inhabitants per km2 which is lower than the average population density of sweden 24 5 inhabitants km2 statistikmyndigheten 2020 since urban areas cover less than one percent of the catchment no significant industrial activities take place and the most important industries are fishing and outdoor tourism plette 2019 the bolmen catchment is part of the lagan river catchment which is one the 22 main catchments of sweden sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2020b 2 2 the lake and its tributaries the main tributaries to lake bolmen are the two rivers lillån and storån in the north together with the outflow from lake unnen called lidhultsån on the western side of the lake many other small rivers and creeks e g dannäsån smedjebäcken torarpsviken and murån are located around lake bolmen and contribute to the lake water inflow to a smaller degree see fig 1 a simplified water balance was established for lake bolmen based on available information about the in and outflows on a long term basis the sum of the in and outflows should be zero any deviations may indicate lack of knowledge regarding certain water balance components the inflows include the main tributaries from the sub catchments and the precipitation over the lake whereas the outflows consist of the tributary bolmån at the southern end of the lake water extracted to the bolmen tunnel used for water supply and the evaporation the inflows from the tributaries was based on the nationwide hydrological model of sweden s hype from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi whereas the outflows are measured at the power station in skeen bolmån and the tunnel the estimated terms in the water balance can be found in table 1 where the mean precipitation and evaporation were set to 860 and 500 mm year respectively small and very small tributaries are not taken into account by the s hype model and therefore the sum of inflows does not exactly correspond to the outflows also in the water balance groundwater was not included assuming that the groundwater in and outflows are similar it is expected that the obtained deviation from zero in the balance of about 14 is mainly related to the uncertainties in the s hype model the 42 km2 large island bolmsö in the center of the lake divides it into five parts with different hydrodynamic properties governed by the inflow from respective tributaries bathymetric conditions shoreline configuration and fetch length for wind generated currents and waves see fig 13 in addition several smaller islands are situated inside the lake resulting in complex water movement and mixing conditions but also in high biological diversity vatteninformationssystem sverige 2019 the northwestern sub basin of the lake is dominated by the two main tributaries storån and lillån and it has a maximum depth of 10 m whereas the northeastern sub basin is significantly shallower with an average depth of 3 m the latter part of the lake shows less depth variations and the inflow is dominated by the river dannäsån the eastern part of lake bolmen is very narrow and generally quite shallow with a number of deep areas reaching 21 m at the small village tannåker the lake is the narrowest and the distance between the island bolmsö and the mainland is not more than 200 m on the western side the lake is in average almost twice as wide compared to the eastern part but with less variations in depth the deepest point in the western part is situated just east of the tiraholm peninsula 28 m most of the water volume is contained in the southern part of the lake where also the deepest point 38 m is located lake bolmen has a retention time of about 1 6 years and the majority of the net flow occurs along the western part of the lake in general bolmen is quite shallow for its size with an average depth of 6 2 m a bathymetric map of the lake can be found in fig 1 even though bolmen overall is quite shallow the lake may become stratified during summer a certain locations according to hamrin 1979 lake bolmen exhibited a thermocline during most summers between 1966 and 1975 at water depths of 7 to 10 m in the northern part and between water depths of 10 and 15 m in the southern part stratification developed more often in the southern part because of larger depths here besides its value for recreation sydvatten ab uses the lake as resource for drinking water production distributing water to 12 municipalities in southwestern sweden a 80 km long tunnel with an cross sectional area of 9 m2 transports around 1400 l s of lake water at free surface flow conditions south where it is treated at the ringsjö water treatment plant and subsequently distributed to the consumers the maximum withdrawal quantity was estimated based on the expected population growth at the time of the tunnel construction in the 1960s and the limit is set by law to 6000 l s sydvatten 2019 2 3 climate according to the köppen climate classification lake bolmen and its catchment is part of the humid continental climate zone without a dry season and warm summers peel et al 2007 several meteorological measurement stations operated by smhi are located inside the catchment the yearly mean temperature is 7 0 c with the highest temperatures occurring during the summer month total annual precipitations amounts to 675 900 mm a with higher precipitation values in the northwestern parts of the catchment sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2019 fig 3 a shows the average monthly temperature and precipitation between 1969 to 2019 for the city of ljungby located about 10 km south east of the catchment an overview of the wind climate for the same location is given in fig 3b the majority of the winds blow from southwest but occasionally strong winds occur with a northern wind direction according to smhi the average start of different seasons vary within sweden and between years but for the studied catchment typical dates are for winter the 15th of december spring the 15th of march summer the 20th of may and autumn at 25th of september sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2017 these dates will be used in the present study to define the seasons employed in the analysis 3 data different sources were employed to compile the data utilized in this paper an overview of the locations of the sampling stations is shown in fig 1 in the following a brief description of the data used in the subsequent analysis will be given 3 1 main tributary and lake sampling data the local water association lagans vattenråd coordinates collects and publishes information on a range of regular water quality measurements at the main tributaries seven stations and inside lake bolmen two stations these stations are shown in fig 1 lagans vattenråd 2018 the first measurements were recorded already in 1935 and from there on further measurements have been conducted with an irregular frequency from 1982 the measurement frequency increased to be more consistent reaching an almost monthly interval for the majority of the measurement locations in 1987 the most recently established measurement station is called 518 murån byholma located in the southern part of the catchment where the first measurements were recorded 2011 at a bimonthly interval table 2 gives an overview of the measurement stations used for the present study coordination and organization of water quality measurements by lagans vattenråd ensured the same measurement standard since 1955 lagans vattenråd 2020 an overview of the available water quality parameters is given in table 3 and parameters used in the analysis are specified the main reason for selecting certain parameters for analysis is availability of data for a sufficient duration 15 years at all stations several parameters e g visibility depth iron or chlorophyll a are just measured at stations inside the lake whereas other parameters for example uv absorbance have only been recorded during the last ten years some of the selected parameters are describing the water quality in a comprehensive manner for example conductivity gives general information about the ionic content the correlation coefficient between all measured parameters and the water color was calculated using the spearman correlation coefficient the result is also given in the table overall the coefficient values obtained are quite low for many of the parameters indicating that there is limited direct relations between these parameters and color since one of the main aims of this research is to understand the relationship between color and different physical parameters in the catchment simultaneous records between the stations is a necessity which determined the selection of the marked parameters in the table 3 2 meteorological data measurements of meteorological data are conducted by smhi all over sweden and can be downloaded as station wise date time series three meteorological stations are located inside the bolmen catchment measuring precipitation air temperature and relative humidity measurements concerning precipitation are available on a monthly basis dating back until may 1886 whereas records of air temperature and humidity exists from august 1995 also on a monthly basis moreover smhi conducts measurement concerning ions in precipitation which were used to analyze acid deposition and ionic changes none of this measurement stations are located directly in the catchment but three stations are within close distance to the catchment boarders although the precipitation measured outside the catchment does not reach lake bolmen it is assumed that the content of ions are similar over a large area and these measurements are representative for the study area the air quality depends on the conditions in large scale air masses thus this assumption should be valid these measurements are part of the nationwide air quality control program of sweden naturvårdsverket 2020 smhi provides simulated hydrological data on a nationwide basis with the model called s hype however the reliability of the derived data may vary depending on the possibility to locally calibrate and validate the model in the case of the tributaries to lake bolmen no data are available concerning the runoff to the lake thus some of the model settings are based on nearby catchments with similar properties this should be kept in mind when these flows are referred to in the analysis the best proxy to runoff is precipitation making the latter parameter useful in the analysis as a substitute to modeled runoff data 3 3 land use and tree species volume data regarding land use and different tree species where obtained from the swedish national forest inventory nfi conducted by the swedish agricultural university slu nfi is a yearly sample inventory performed by the department of forest resource management at slu concerning all land use classes in sweden with focus on forest development random samples are taken at both temporary and permanent stations nilsson et al 2018 the data used for this research is at the county län level the catchment of lake bolmen is shared by three counties jönköpings län kronobergs län and hallands län jönköpings län includes the northern part of the catchment with the largest share of 62 whereas kronobergs län in the south has a share of 28 and hallands län in the west a share of 10 since the two main tributaries of lake bolmen are located in the northern part of the catchment land use data in jönköpings län are considered to be the most influential regarding the water quality in the lake information about specific tree species is specified five year averages whereas changes in land use are recorded yearly data from all three counties were documented for the first time in 1926 and until 1955 no further records were taken from 1955 the data is available at regular intervals data before 1955 have not been included in the analysis as the single value is not considered useful even though the lake bolmen catchment makes up only a small part inside any of the counties county wise data is regarded as representative since land use inside these three counties may be considered as almost homogeneous regarding forested land 4 methodology the brown color in lake bolmen and its tributaries varies in time and space at a wide range of scales these variations are a function of climatic and catchment related factors as well as internal processes in the water bodies having natural and anthropogenic causes the data available for analysis imply limitations to the process scale that can be investigated in the present study the focus is on seasonal to decadal long term scale the event scale days is not discussed except briefly in connection with resuspension the purpose of the data analysis was to determine the temporal and spatial patterns of the color variation in lake bolmen and its tributaries including other relevant water quality and meteorological parameters that is closely related to the forcing of water color another goal was to establish relationships between color and other variables indicating drivers for brownification thus standard statistical methods were used including measures of population properties e g mean and standard deviation and dependencies among variables e g correlation and regression spectral analysis was used to detect oscillatory components in the data sets together with their dominant frequencies in order to obtain a better understanding of the physical system of lake bolmen especially the large scale water movement some simple mathematical models of the flow were developed to complement the statistical analysis these models also included surface waves generated by wind that may cause resuspension although the time scale of such events is much shorter that the scales of interest in this study the occurrence of resuspension may influence the color over longer time periods the above mentioned data were typically recorded with different frequencies and for time series varying in length in this study the analysis was primarily performed for data between the 1st of january 1987 and the 31st of december 2018 to achieve the best possible comparability between the data series it was necessary to manipulate the data sets in order not to lose information for example generate the same measurement frequency also differing magnitudes for different parameters needed to be adjusted to enhance the possibility to detect spatial and temporal patterns and dependencies broken measurement equipment and insufficient sampling often result in missing data a common problem in most data recordings graham 2009 the data employed in this study were also affected by such shortcomings implying that missing data needed to be handled in an acceptable manner without introducing any bias thus the following steps were performed to enable comparison between seasonal and long term data in lake bolmen and its catchment first the data were resampled to seasonal intervals according to the seasons mentioned in section 2 3 resulting in a maximum of four values per year for all values except precipitation the mean of all measurements for respective season was taken as the representative value and the resampling was performed to the last day of the season for precipitation data the seasonal sum was chosen as representative value since precipitation reflects the flow that governs the transport and should therefore be considered accumulated if a station did not have any values during a particular season no resampling could be made and the value for this season was marked as missing no resampling was performed for the land use and forest development data since the sampling period for these data is one year the method of resampling did also help to mitigate the amount of missing values in the data to be analyzed since just four instead of twelve values were necessary to complete a year then the data were standardized which results in a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 standardization has been performed using the following formula x x x σ hereby stands x for the standardized value x for the seasonal mean values x for the mean of the whole measurement series and σ for the standard deviation the resampling did not always result in four values per year since at some stations measurements were only conducted during the summer months different analysis methods e g frequency analysis require sampling at a fixed frequency without missing data making it necessary to interpolate between existing data points data series with such properties were obtained using interpolation filling the missing data using a linear approach that considered the actual time gap between recorded values however it is important to note that such analysis of interpolated times series can only provide information on frequencies that are lower than the typical sampling frequency long term trends have been analyzed using locally weighted regression also called loess or lowess cleveland and devlin 1988 using a yearly frequency to allow for comparison with land use and forest development data for the long term trend analysis of meteorological data the aforementioned data cleansing processes were omitted since smhi already provides pre treated data sets the data analysis was carried out using the scipy and scikit learn librarys for python3 scipy offers a comprehensive set of functions concerning applied statistics and scikit learn is a set of libraries for machine learning algorithms 5 results and discussion as previously mentioned water browning exhibits varying behavior in time and space depending on the forcing factors and the general environmental conditions thus an analysis of temporal and spatial patterns of water color and related parameters will yield insights to the physical processes controlling brownification the data set analyzed encompassed measurements of color over three decades in lake bolmen and its main tributaries as well as water quality meteorological and land use parameters the resolution of the data made it possible to determine seasonal and long term patterns in the color and the other parameters in the following the results of such analyses are presented and discussed considering different time and space scales 5 1 spatial variability since lake bolmen is a large lake with an extension from north to south of about 35 km spatial variations in water quality are expected during the passage of a river through the catchment it acts as a transport medium for dissolved and particulate matter where changes in the water quality reflects the local catchment characteristics for lake bolmen and its catchment almost all water quality parameters show variations in space with higher concentrations in the northern parts and lower concentrations in the southern parts the highest concentrations are commonly measured at the two main tributaries storån and lillån discharging their water into northern lake bolmen the difference between north and south is particular noticeable when comparing the color values between the different stations see fig 4 an exception to the trend is the tributary murån located in the southern part of the catchment which has an average of 270 mg pt l a reason for the much higher value from murån might be the particular conditions prevailing in this catchment in addition the shorter measurement period the first measurements were conducted in 2011 implies that the record was taken when the color magnitude experienced an increasing tendency the average color during the analyzed period 1987 2018 for the main tributaries storån and lillån are 176 mg pt l and 217 mg pt l respectively the outflowing water of lake bolmen is significantly lower with an average of 70 mg pt l for the same period the spatial variation of color is comparable to other water pollutants such as total nitrogen and total phosphorous which show decreasing magnitudes from north to south the highest total nitrogen and total phosphorous values were measured in lillån with an average of about 1100 μg l total nitrogen and 45 μg l total phosphorous oxygen shows similar values for the tributaries 10 12 mg l but lower values inside the lake 5 9 mg l the lowest oxygen concentration was measured at the bottom of the lake at the station 510 bolmen south bottom followed by the station 530 bolmen north bottom spatial changes in precipitation measurements are noticeable to a less extend where the measured precipitation is the lowest in the city of ljungby with an average for the considered period 1995 2019 of 719 mm year for the station kävsjö the annual average precipitation is 831 mm year and for bolmen 866 mm year a similar behavior was observed for the concentrations of ions in the precipitation which show minor spatial changes the highest concentration of sulfate in precipitation has been measured in aneboda which is located circa 50 km east of the northern part of lake bolmen the ratio of productive forest land differs little between the three counties covering the bolmen catchment and all forests are dominated by spruce and pine trees fig 9 shows that the total amount of forest area is largest in jönköping county due to the much larger total area of this county within the catchment halland county has the smallest amount of mixed coniferous forest but the highest amount of spruce forest area the smallest share of spruce forest with a mean of about 44 is recorded in jönköping county which is mainly located in the northern part of the catchment broadleaf tree forest plays a minor role whereof halland county has the highest share with 10 of productive forest land differences in residence time and land use influence the color magnitude of the outflowing water quality of a subcatchments the water from the tributary lidhultsån originates from lake unnen on the western side showing lower magnitudes in color compared to the river murån discharging into the southern part both sub catchments are similar in size but the lidhutlsån catchment has almost 20 more water areas than the murån catchment which is dominated by wetlands as the volume of lakes is usually higher than the volume of a wetlands for the same surface area the retention time of a lake is longer than the one of a wetland a longer retention time promotes sedimentation of organic content as well as the action of biological and chemical processes which results in lower magnitudes of color a similar observation have been made by temnerud et al 2014 for different catchments all over sweden and for industrial applications using natural systems in the cleaning processes of water by svensson et al 2015 however this only seems to be case for larger streams as this results are contradictory to research performed across 17 smaller low order streams kothawala et al 2015 for sub catchments with a higher share in agriculture land e g lillån river the correlation between total phosphorous and water color shows a higher value r 2 0 55 which indicates that agricultural practices impact the water color also this result is an indication that the agricultural activities in this sub catchment is dominated by animal farming instead of crop growing since it has been demonstrated that animal husbandry generate higher phosphorous flows linderholm 2012 even though the volume of lake bolmen is large about 1 1 km3 with regard to the inflows and may be able to buffer changes in water quality for an appreciable time the water quality of the tributaries will to a large degree define the lake water quality 5 2 seasonal variability distinct seasonal changes occur for all water quality parameters the highest water color is typically measured during the summer season and the annual variation in color differs markedly between measurement locations in the magnitude of 50 to 100 an exception to this seasonal behavior was observed at measurement station 520 unnens outflow located in the river lidhultsån where the average water color is the highest in winter and the lowest during summer the water temperature shows the most significant changes varying during the year in a range of 15 c with summer showing the highest temperatures as all water temperature measurements have been conducted 0 5 m below the water surface except for the stations 530 bolmen north bottom and 510 bolmen south bottom the temperature is highly related to the air temperature for the stations 530 bolmen north 530 bolmen north bottom 510 bolmen south and 510 bolmen south bottom no analysis of seasonal variations could be performed since all measurements are conducted during summer other parameters with the seasonal maximum in summer are alkalinity total phosphorus ph toc and turbidity total nitrogen reaches the yearly maximum during the spring and the yearly minimum in summer which is the same for oxygen the higher amount of total nitrogen is most likely related to increased fertilization as a result of seed bed preparation the highest precipitations occurs during summer see fig 3 which is also the season with the highest air temperatures fig 5 shows the spectral analysis for a number of parameters for the last 20 years at the station 550 storåns outflow into bolmen which was chosen for analysis since it includes the most comprehensive data set available analysis done on a monthly basis all parameters show a clear spike at the frequency of 1 year 1 which corresponds to the annual variation a larger number of smaller spikes are visible with frequencies higher than once per year but no particular pattern emerges for the parameters studied this indicates that these parameters are primary drivers for the seasonal variation in color both in the lake and in the tributaries as observed kritzberg et al 2019 the toc follows the color closely displaying the same seasonal pattern changes in total phosphorous load the ph of the water body and the ph of the precipitation influence seasonal changes of the water color the lower ph during winter and spring results in a higher mobility for organic matter which subsequently gets washed out with increased precipitation during summer resulting in higher color magnitude during this season the increased ph inside the lake might be the result higher precipitation as well since the measured values indicate a higher ph in precipitation than the lake water furthermore seasonal changes in lake water ph are affected of the internal metabolism of the lake ecosystems during warmer seasons the biological activity of algae is higher resulting in increased co2 uptake and an increase in ph during the summer schindler et al 1972 tank et al 2009 5 3 long term variability this section focuses on long term variabilities and trends here a differentiation is made between the time period for detailed water quality measurements 1987 2018 and other measurements available for a longer time period if not stated otherwise long term in the context of this section discusses the time between late 1980s and 2018 the tributaries flowing into lake bolmen are of varying size where storån river in the northwestern part of the lake is by far the largest contributor according to sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2020b it supplies in average 9 4 m3 s water to bolmen followed by the second and third largest contributors lidhultsån river with 3 2 m3 s and lillån river with 2 5 m3 s respectively storån and lillån both join bolmen in the north western part and contribute about 83 5 of the color into lake bolmen the flow of this contributing rivers is predominantly controlled by runoff determined by precipitation over each subcatchment an increase in the total annual precipitation as well as days with extreme precipitation have been noticed since the 1950s and these trends are continuing see fig 6 a day is regarded as having an extreme precipitation event if the daily sum of the precipitation is higher than the upper 95 percentile more than 10 5 mm day of all other precipitation events in 2015 smhi published a similar analysis for whole sweden which considered a daily precipitation of more than 40 mm day as extreme sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2015 according to this latter criterion a yearly extreme event would happen to a much less extent however it can be noticed that the return period of such events significantly decreased with time the annual total precipitation has increased by almost 100 mm year over the past 60 years and the number of extremes events more than 10 5 mm day by three to four times higher precipitation should affect the inflow to lake bolmen from the subcatchments however the annual mean outflow has not changed since 1950 and there is not trend in the lake water level in contrast an increase in events with higher than usual flows can be observed see fig 7 a similar trend is noticeable in long term temperature trends in the catchment the yearly mean temperature has increased by about 1 5 c over the past 60 years and the amount of days with extreme temperature events has almost tripled see fig 8 a day with an average temperature higher than 17 3 c is considered as day with extreme temperature whereby this temperature represents the upper 95 percentile of the analyzed measurements due to higher annual mean temperatures evaporation above lake bolmen should increase which may also explain that the outflow from the lake has remained constant however the number of extreme temperature and precipitation events show large variations between years for the analyzed period these results are in agreement with the long term climate analysis performed by smhi sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut 2020a precipitation and temperature are main indicators for climate variations and lead to changes of the catchment hydrology which may have major impact on the water quality forest development also shows significant changes with time and the total area of forest has increased in the range 75 to 100 fig 9 shows the increase in volume and the share between different species inside the counties that encompasses the bolmen catchment especially the amount of spruce shows a higher increase compared to pine and birch trees this is because almost 60 of the swedish forest is used commercially and spruce is the dominant tree in these forests due to its high yield the royal swedish academy of agriculture and forestry 2015 the data presented in fig 12 implies that long term changes in color are highly related to birch volume in the catchment but it is important to notice that birch has a small share in the bolmen catchment and therefore the influence of birch might not be significant the increase in forest land shows significant changes regarding the share of mires a decrease is noticeable since the 1960s but it reaches a more stable share in the late 1980s from 2002 a large increase in dead wood and a decrease in productive forests are noticeable for all three counties with a maximum increase of up to 300 this increase is due to heavy storm damage caused by the cyclone gudrun in 2005 södra 2018 in addition to increasing yearly mean temperature and annual precipitation all water quality parameters show different long term trends despite spatial variation between the measurement stations discussed in section 5 1 certain general behaviors regarding the long term development for these parameters have been observed the average magnitude of the water color has increased significantly during the last 60 years see fig 2 for the station 520 unnens outflow the annual average color changed from 63 mg pt l in 1987 to 152 mg pt l in 2012 and for the station 540 lillån outflow into bolmen from 196 mg pt l to 230 mg pt l as mentioned previously spatial differences occur and the largest increase in color was measured in the southern part of lake bolmen the stations in the northern part of the lake show in general higher water color magnitudes in the range 50 to 100 compared to the southern part however since 2008 the trends have changed implying decrease for the northern stations from 2012 decreases can also be observed in the southern part of the lake this decrease indicates a slow down in the brownification process although the general magnitude is still much higher than 60 years ago to more firmly deduce the cause behind this recent development to ensure that it is not only a response to short term climate variability and changes in catchment conditions further analysis of future measurements need to be conducted fig 10 shows the long term trends of color at different stations using a local weighted regression with a period of one year the difference δ between the annual color maximum and minimum range shows considerable variations between years δ 25 to 250 mg pt l depending on year and station years with a higher annual average color also have larger ranges and conversely years with a lower annual average have smaller ranges the long term trend in the range shows no significant change except for the station 508 murån where the amplitude decreases δ 400 mg pt l in 2012 to δ 50 mg pt l in 2018 the stability of the range shows that the overall magnitude of color has increased in recent years not just the annual maxima a similar behavior is observed for total organic carbon toc which is to be expected since color and toc are known for their high correlation and toc is often used as a proxy for water color finstad et al 2016 however this correlation may not be apparent at other locations in sweden where brownification has been observed temnerud et al 2014 conductivity displays a contrasting behavior to water color where higher color values coincides with lower conductivity as demonstrated by the negative spearmen correlation coefficient such a relationship has been shown by eikebrokk et al 2018 of interest is the time shifted correlation between both total nitrogen and total phosphorous and water color particularly in sub catchments dominated by agriculture e g for the river lillån the lake ph shows a positive trend of ca 0 5 ph units during the last 60 years for all measurement stations this increase in lake water ph may be related to a general ph increase as a result of the recovery from acid rain however further investigations of how the changes in lake ph are related to changes in the environment are needed the average yearly temperature in all tributaries shows no significant increase during the measurement period however a positive trend is noticeable for the measurements performed in summer resulting in an increase of up to 3 c during the period for this season the higher water temperature is most likely the result of increasing air temperature as previously pointed out continued rise in the average air temperature as well as increasing days of extreme temperature will cause the lake water temperature during summer to further increase this will not just effect the stratification of the lake but also have significant impact on the flora and fauna rasconi et al 2015 already today an increasing amount of chlorophyll a particularly in the northern part of the lake has been observed however a noticeable increase in cyanobacteria has not yet been detected borgström 2020 an increasing ph is the most significant change occurring in the precipitation for all three stations with an increase of about 0 5 to 1 ph units in addition the level of sulfate content in the precipitation has significantly decreased dropping to levels below 1 mg l in general changes regarding ion concentration of the precipitation are similar at the different locations but aneboda shows the most absolute noticeable changes due to the significantly longer measurement period the decline in sulfur deposition and increase in ph of precipitation is in line with results shown by björnerås et al 2017 and may be related to declining influences from industrialization yearly average water and air temperature show both and increase in magnitude with the highest increase during the summer months in contrast the yearly mean humidity decreased about 1 during ten years indicating higher evaporation rates several long term trends including the discussed above are illustrated in fig 11 for the station 510 bolmen south as before the trends are emphasized by using the locally weighted regression also to allow for more easy comparison the data has been standardized the long term increase in water color and organic carbon might be the result of different human induced changes in the catchment one such change is the increase in productive forest land dominated by spruce which also has resulted in a decrease of mires however the effects on the water quality exhibits a significant time lag before changes appear which is illustrated in fig 12 specifically when looking at changes in spruce volume and water color it is assumed that the majority of carbon inside lake bolmen is of allochthone origin introduced from the catchment and a much smaller part derives from biological processes inside the lake this assumption needs to be proven with further research which requires detailed measurements regarding carbon flows inside the lake and along the main tributaries moreover the increase in annual precipitation and mean temperature will further promote the trend of increasing color specifically regarding yearly extremes since seasonal changes of color magnitudes are governed by temperature and precipitation this assumption is in agreement with earlier findings de wit et al 2016 weyhenmeyer et al 2016 to summarize on the decadal scale the color in lake bolmen has increased substantially although in recent years a marked decrease has been observed the precipitation and temperature have increased simultaneously whereas the sulphate resulting mainly from atmospheric deposition has decreased all these changes tend to produce more brown color in the water and thus it is likely that the long term brownification is a result of these developments the forest area has increased during the last decades up until the major storm gudrun hit in 2005 devastating large areas with forest this increase could also have contributed to the brownification during several decades however after the storm occurred the reduction in forest activities may have influenced the color causing the observed decrease thus when the forestry has restored its capacity an increase in color is expected as the meteorological parameters most likely will continue to follow their increasing trends 5 4 lake flows the short term flows in the lake determining the color distribution at the event scale is primarily generated by the wind either directly through wind induced currents or indirectly through surface waves which in turn generate currents at the bed on a long term basis the water movement and exchange is governed by the through flow as given by the tributaries to the lake in this study the focus is on seasonal and long term color patterns and their drivers thus the short term transport and mixing by the wind is not discussed however some calculations of the wave conditions at different locations in the lake were made to assess the potential for resuspension if such events occur frequently then the mean color may be impacted even on a longer time scale the shoreline configuration and bathymetry of lake bolmen are relatively complex affecting the water movement and exchange the main inflows to the lake is located in the northwestern part and the outflow at the most southern point in order to estimate the large scale flow pattern through the lake as well as the lake residence time the lake was divided into five sub basins as shown in fig 13 to estimate the flow between the sub basins the constrictions between these basins were described using open channel flow including minor losses at the entrance and exit the constrictions were taken to have rectangular cross sections and the geometry was obtained from bathymetric maps the manning roughness n was set equal to n 0 03 at all constrictions and the minor loss coefficient were given standard values from the hydraulic literature through continuity equations for each sub basin and energy equations for water particles being transported either west or east of bolmsö the unknown flows q between the basins could be calculated q 1 to q 5 see fig 13 which in turn was the basis for estimating the residence time for each basin a water particle moving through both the northern and southern parts would spend an extra time of 12 18 months in the lake compared to only moving through the most southern part based on the mean flow conditions this estimate is based on a simple translation through the basin due to the net flow without including any mixing the result of the analysis is shown in table 4 where three different inflow conditions have been investigated minimum mean and maximum of the annual mean inflows from the tributaries the calculations show that for all three inflow conditions 80 of the water flow is transported along the western side of the lake which will have implications for the long term transport and mixing in the lake the residence time t for each sub basin is displayed in table 5 defined as t v q where v is the water volume of the basin and q is the through flow for the basin the parameter t was calculated for each flow condition in order to obtain a range of possible values for t the prevailing winds at lake bolmen originate from southwest see fig 3b and even though the fetches are limited surface waves can appear of a magnitude that may induce resuspension no wave measurements are available for the lake thus the waves were calculated with a model based on the smb methods coastal engineering research center 1984 modified by hanson and larson 2008 employing fetch length water depth wind direction and wind speed as input a time series of wind data from ljungby between 1996 and 2017 at 3 h resolution was used to calculate the wave climate at three sites located approximately in the north middle and south of the lake see fig 13 the model results show that the largest wave during the study period appeared at the northern point h s 0 52 m t p 2 4 s where h s is the energy based significant wave height and t p is the peak spectral period whereas at the middle point the average wave height for the entire period is the largest h s 0 06 m t p 0 8 s in shallow areas the largest waves can induce shear stresses on the bed that are sufficiently large to exceed the critical shear stress and mobilize bottom sediment calculations of the bed shear stress under oscillatory waves camenen et al 2009 was performed for a range of bed roughnesses and compared with different critical shear stresses representative for lake sediment no information is presently available about the bed conditions in lake bolmen so typical values had to be employed in these calculations for example for a bed roughness of 0 2 mm and a critical shear stress of 0 05 n m2 the mean duration of exceedance for this stress was 12 5 h year at the most northern point thus resuspension is likely to occur during higher storms but it is primarily on the event scale lake bolmen might be ice covered during january to march which will affect the wave generation and resuspension ice cover was not included in the above calculations implying that the estimates are on the conservative side overall these results indicate that that many factors affecting the brownification in lake bolmen and its tributaries are of natural origin for example precipitation and temperature and thus not possible to influence however if the increase noted in these variables are indeed a result of climate change induced by man reduction of emissions may halt the trend and the brownification the decrease in sulphate is most likely a result of such reduced emissions although this probably has had a reverse effect on the brown color the forestry is an activity that could be managed to limit its contribution to the brown color but still the connection between color and forestry practices is not well known and more data are needed to clarify it 6 conclusion long time series on water color in lake bolmen and its tributaries together with other water quality meteorological and land use parameters were analyzed to determine temporal and spatial patterns and their properties at the seasonal and decadal scale the inter relationships between color and the other parameters were investigated to detect drivers for brownification and to assess whether the drivers were natural or human induced a range of statistical methods were employed to determine properties of the parameters studied and their inter dependencies but also models of the flows in the lake were developed to assess the impact of these flows on the color at different scales total organic carbon can be taken as a proxy for water color showing the highest correlation with color of all water quality parameters seasonal variations could be linked mainly to changes in air temperature and precipitation which influence the transport patterns and solubility of organic matter in the catchment at the longer time scale decadal these meteorological parameters were also clear drivers of the color because of changes in climatic conditions implying higher temperature and precipitation in addition changes in land use particularly more forest land and more spruce in the forest proved to be influencing factor on the browning possibly together with changes in the sub catchment retention times the major storm gudrun in 2005 caused dramatic changes to the land use characteristics devastating large areas of forest which in turn influenced the transport of material in the tributaries and to the lake a connection between the amount of dead forest volume and color was observed where a greater amount of dead forest led to higher magnitudes of color however overall there was a decrease in color after the large changes observed in the catchment after the storm since the storm felled trees have been removed from the catchment models of the water flows in the lake and through its sub basins yielded estimates of the residence times which will influence the transport and mixing of color however a more comprehensive assessment requires additional measurements in the lake besides the two locations available at present calculations also indicated that resuspension by surface waves may occur on an event basis probably with a total duration of less than a day per year but at a shorter time scales it might be important to consider more detailed investigations of resuspension requires extensive sampling of sediment conditions at the lake bottom as well as hydrodynamic measurements of the flow conditions with continued increasing trends in precipitation and temperature in the lake bolmen catchment as well as extreme weather events the problem with water browning might increase further in the future longer and drier summers might lead to forest dieback as is the case in germany thorn et al 2019 thus the amount of transportable organic matter may increase subsequently resulting in higher magnitudes of color also shorter periods with ice cover can intensify the wave conditions and lead to more events with resuspension lake bolmen does not yet show signs of eutrophication but the trend of increasing nutrients should be analyzed in more detail in the future it might be necessary to adjust local agriculture and forest practices to mitigate nutrient transport which will help to keep a healthy trophic state for lake bolmen thus improved interaction between different stakeholders would be beneficial in order to allow for more detailed predictions of the future development in lake bolmen further measurements at higher spatial and temporal resolution are necessary and should also include hydrological information as the physical relationships controlling water browning are not
