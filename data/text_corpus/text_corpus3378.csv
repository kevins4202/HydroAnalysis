the solid fraction of archived biosolids samples from australia and the united kingdom from between 1950 and 2016 six plastics were detected with increasing concentrations observed over time for each plastic biosolids plastic concentrations correlated with plastic production estimates implying a potential link between plastics production consumption and leakage into the environment prior to the 1990s the leakage of plastics into biosolids was limited except for polystyrene increased leakage was observed from the 1990s onwards potentially driven by increased consumption of polyethylene

treatment of sewage are a sink for plastics and are a pathway of plastics release into the environment when applied to land corradini et al 2019 nizzetto et al 2016a okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b as global plastics production and consumption continues to increase without intervention the release of plastics to wastewater treatment plants wwtps will also likely increase hence more plastic will enter the environment via this pathway corradini et al 2019 okoffo et al 2020b rillig 2020 estimates suggest that annually 63 000 430 000 t mt and 44 000 300 000 mt of plastics may be added to farmlands in europe and north america respectively through the application of biosolids nizzetto et al 2016a nizzetto et al 2016b similarly it is estimated that about 4 700 mt of plastics are released into the australian environment through biosolids end use each year equating to a release of approximately 200 g person year okoffo et al 2020b there is potential for plastics released to land from biosolids end use to persist and accumulate in soils due to slow degradation and microbial assimilation corradini et al 2019 rolsky et al 2020 from here plastics may transfer to other environments such as rivers lakes and oceans lusher et al 2017 nizzetto et al 2016a plastic particles in soils have been shown to affect the health of soil organisms huerta lwanga et al 2016 ju et al 2019 judy et

scientific research on plastics pollution is rapidly developing quantitative measurement of plastics in biosolids has been extremely challenging and as a result only a few studies have successfully extracted and quantified plastics in biosolids campo et al 2019 edo et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2021 using a number of different measurement techniques including microscopy raman microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir previous studies have provided particle count size shape color and partly polymer type related data in biosolids which may not reflect the total mass concentration of plastics in view of the limited mass based concentrations data and the recent concerns regarding the increasing consumption and release of plastics through biosolids there is a need to fully understand the release pathway of plastics into the environment on a mass concentration basis such data are also required to understand the plastics cycle from initial leakage from human activities into wastewater and subsequently into biosolids during treatment that are applied to soil narain 2018 nizzetto et al 2016a nizzetto et al 2016b rillig and lehmann 2020 wwt 2018 how the contamination of biosolids with plastics has changed with time in the context of increasing global plastic production and consumption is currently unknown the aim of this study was to quantify the concentration of plastics in biosolids from between 1950 and 2016 to evaluate the historical trend in plastics release and evaluate the relationship between the concentration of plastics in biosolids and global plastic production and consumption this was achieved through the analysis of archived and contemporary biosolids samples sourced from the united kingdom uk and australia from the 1950s to 2016 donner et al 2015 okoffo et al 2020b polystyrene polycarbonate poly methyl methacrylate polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride plastics were quantified in the historical biosolids samples constituting 70 of the plastics consumed worldwide plasticseurope 2019 the results of this study provide the first mass concentration based quantitative data of plastics contamination in biosolids over time thereby increasing our understanding of historical plastics leakage into wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals analytical standards of polyvinyl chloride polystyrene and poly methyl methacrylate were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and low density polyethylene referred to as polyethylene from thermo fischer

ca usa 2 2 biosolids samples a total of 59 biosolids samples were analyzed for plastics and were sourced from sample archives in the uk 23 and australia 36 donner et al 2015 table s1 the historical uk samples were acquired from a set of samples from the early 1950 s to 1990 s these samples have been previously analyzed for metals and were archived following use riche 1968 the historical uk samples were dried and stored at room temperature and atmosphere in sealed glass jars from the time of production and initial use until they were sub sampled for this study donner et al 2015 the historical australian biosolids from the 1970 s to 2009 were collected from a biosolids storage facility containing stockpiled samples from a large wastewater treatment plant donner et al 2015 it should be noted that some details on the date of production were not available from the historical australian dataset where the production date of n 4 samples could only be identified as a range of years see explanation in assumption and limitations section table s1 the biosolids at the facility were stored in open air stockpiles that were subjected to natural weathering processes from production to collection in 2009 donner et al 2015 for the contemporary 2009 and 2016 samples for the uk and australia targeted sampling campaigns were undertaken to assess samples from a range of wastewater treatment plant catchments donner et al 2015 o brien et al 2019 okoffo et al 2020b it should be noted that all samples from the 1950 2009 except the 2016 samples have been previously analyzed for non labile silver species and were archived following use until they were sub sampled for this study donner et al 2015 the 2016 australian biosolids samples data from our previously published work was included in this study okoffo et al 2020b table s1 those biosolids samples were sourced directly from wastewater treatment plants in the uk and australia in 2009 and 2016 dried and stored in sealed glass jars donner et al 2015 o brien et al 2019 okoffo et al 2020b together these historical and contemporary samples provide a glimpse into the past that can help us understand historical trends of plastics in biosolids 2 3 sample extraction and pyr gc ms analysis biosolids samples were extracted and analyzed processed following a validated method previously reported okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b briefly samples approximately 1 g each were milled to a fine powder with a commercial grinder for 30 min extech equipment pty ltd victoria australia following this each sample was weighed into a 5 ml pre cleaned ple stainless steel extraction cell and filled with pre cleaned hydromatrix cells were spiked with deuterated internal standards 200 µg of polystyrene d5 and polyethylene d4 1 mg ml in dichloromethane dcm and toluene respectively and extracted using dcm at 180 c and 1500 psi with a static time of 5 min using three extraction cycles all plastic sizes in biosolids samples were analyzed as samples were not sieved or pretreated prior to extractions hence the results are obtained for the total mass and entire particle size spectrum of plastics contamination in samples immediately after extraction 160 µl of each sample extract was transferred into pyrolysis cups eco cup lf frontier labs japan solvent evaporated for 30 mins in laminar flow cabinet for double shot pyr gc ms analysis using a multi shot micro furnace pyrolyzer ega py 3030d equipped with an auto shot sampler as 1020e both frontier labs japan and attached to a shimadzu gc ms qp2010 plus shimadzu corporation japan okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b detailed double shot pyr gc ms conditions are given in the supporting information table s2 the first pyrolysis shot ramped from 100 to 300 c of the double shot method was used as a clean up step to thermally desorb remove the potentially interfering volatile and semi volatile organic materials co extracted from biosolids samples with the second pyrolysis shot at 650 c used to quantitatively measure plastics identified in samples okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b to identify and quantify plastics in samples plastics specific indicator ions for polypropylene polystyrene polyethylene terephthalate poly methyl methacrylate polyvinyl chloride polycarbonate and polyethylene were selected as described and identified previously okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b summarized in table s3 s4 the method used in this study was optimized to resolve indicator ion selectivity i e against a number of organic materials and biogenic polymers natural materials thermal degradation solubility dissolution and stability of ple extracts and matrix related issues identified for several of the plastics in our previous research okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b details on these procedures can be found in our previous papers okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b ribeiro et al 2020 instrumental calibration was performed for the seven plastics by ple extracting plastic standards and aliquoting into pyrolysis cups 10 calibration points ranging from 0 05 to 50 µg cup having r2 0 95 table s4 calibration curves were made by plotting the peak area ratio of indicator ions to internal standard ions versus the concentration of each target plastic and using the integration results for quantification polyethylene d4 was used as an internal standard for polyethylene polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate while polystyrene d5 was used for poly methyl methacrylate polycarbonate and polyvinyl chloride due to similar extraction method recoveries all values reported in the study were corrected for recovery of the corresponding internal standard limits of detection lod and quantification loq for each plastic were calculated by multiplying the standard deviation of 7 replicate injections of the lowest calibration standard with 3 3 and 10 having a signal to noise ratio larger than 10 respectively table s4 2 4 quality assurance and quality control qa qc quality assurance and control steps were implemented to prevent contamination of samples all laboratory glassware and equipment were rinsed with liquid chromatography grade acetone followed by liquid chromatography grade dcm prior to use cotton laboratory coats were worn during all steps of analysis similarly glass or metal equipment were used when possible during laboratory procedures the work was performed in a laminar flow cabinet to minimize contamination by airborne plastics with samples covered with aluminum foil when not being processed all working areas were wiped down with 70 ethanol prior to starting experiments pressurized liquid extraction ple cells were sonicated with acetone and dcm prior to use to remove background plastic contamination prior to each ple extraction batch ple cells were conditioned to remove possible plastics contamination prior to pyr gc ms analysis system cleans no pyrolysis cups and blank cups were analyzed to demonstrate the absence of plastics contamination in the system all pyrolysis cups used in the study were new and washed in dcm before adding sample aliquots as a further cleaning step to avoid any possible contamination procedural blanks consisting of pre washed hydromatrix n 10 were treated as real samples and included in each batch of biosolids samples to undergo all procedures to monitor processing and extraction contamination instrumental blanks n 10 e g pure dcm solvent blank pyrolysis cups no pyrolysis cups as a system clean were included and analyzed in each batch of samples injected after every 10 samples to demonstrate the lack of cross contamination carryover of target plastics from sample to sample secondary contamination background response or potential instrument contamination to evaluate the risks of sample contamination during sample preparation and processing glass fiber filters whatman gf d n 10 were placed in the laminar flow cabinet and on the laboratory bench where samples were prepared these were treated extracted and analyzed in the same batch as biosolids samples in all laboratory and procedure blank samples plastic was either not detected or lower than the loqs table s5 to assess the reproducibility of the extraction and analysis methods over time an aliquot of a composite biosolids sample was extracted and analyzed with each batch of samples as a qaqc sample similarly ten duplicates of randomly selected biosolids samples were analyzed in different batches to assess the repeatability of the method and the relative standard deviation rsds of individual concentrations in qaqc and duplicate samples were 20 instrumental drift in sensitivity was checked by injecting a midpoint calibration standard after every 15 samples method recoveries of the individual plastics were assessed through spiking five replicates of biosolids samples plastics spiked into biosolids before extraction with between 20 and 100 µg of each plastic and 200 µg each of polystyrene d5 and polyethylene d4 internal standards and extracted following the above protocol average standard deviation absolute recoveries not internal standard recovery corrected were 107 16 polyethylene 103 18 poly methyl methacrylate 105 24 polystyrene 101 21 polyethylene terephthalate 98 18 polycarbonate 90 17 polypropylene and 102 25 polyvinyl chloride table s6 recoveries were estimated by comparing concentrations of plastics obtained from spiked samples with those of an un spiked sample subtracting the concentrations found in the un spiked sample okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b internal standard recoveries ranged from 82 polyethylene d4 to 96 polystyrene d5 2 5 assumptions and limitations there are a number of assumptions and limitations that need to be considered when interpreting this study uv irradiation and solar uv radiation are necessary to initiate photo oxidation of most polymers chamas et al 2020 uv radiation in sunlight causes oxidation of the polymer matrix resulting in chemical bond breakage napper and thompson 2020 in environments lacking both sunlight and oxygen degradation or weathering is unlikely to proceed naturally due to the high temperatures required ahmad et al 2015 chamas et al 2020 onwudili et al 2009 the archived biosolids samples used in this study were freeze dried air dried biosolids that were stored under ambient conditions and atmosphere in sealed glass jars until sub sampled hence weathering or polymer degradation due to uv radiation mechanical abrasion thermal and chemical action were not considered a major issue during sample storage as this was convenience sampling we could not take into account weathering of plastics before sampling but only after sampling and storage it should be noted that samples weren t available over the whole course of the 70 years timeframe 1950s to 2016 as these were obtained from archived samples some year groups were not available and samples were not equally distributed over the years table s1 this study gathered available samples by convenience and we acknowledge the limitations in our study regarding sample representativeness across the years however to the best of our knowledge no study has evaluated plastics concentrations in biosolids before 2010 okoffo et al 2019 additionally it is possible that no other biosolid samples over this timeframe exist in a sample archive elsewhere one should also note the uncertainty around when 4 of the samples 1970s early 1980s late 1980s late 1990s 1980s early 2000s and 1990s early 2000s see table s1 were collected where the exact year was not recorded in the archive but was listed as a range of years we have plotted the data to the midpoint of the possible date range of the year estimate e g if late 1980s late 1990s then it would be plotted as at 1993 with a 5 year range and plotted dotted lines to indicate when the samples could have come from it should also be noted that over time more biosolids may have been retained from wastewater as treatment processes have been improved and that the recovery of the mass of biosolids from wastewater including sources such as industry might have likely changed likewise a significant shift in biosolids production might have occurred over this period from minimal treatment to maximum energy extraction this will reduce overall solids and increase concentration of recalcitrant components like plastics therefore the continuously increasing concentrations of plastics in the contemporary samples may be influenced by the treatment processes being more effective in collecting plastics today than 1950s i e assessing the efficiency of the processes today compared to the 1950s however it was not possible to account for any changes in wastewater treatment processes over the years and there has been no analysis of change in processes over time during that time period in this study similarly we assume that the two countries uk and australia might have similar increasing plastics consumption trends to global plastic production rates translating directly to plastics reaching wastewater treatment plants biosolids over time nevertheless we cannot assume that wastewater treatment processes that generated biosolids have not changed since the 1950s and is the same between the two countries as such we do not seek to compare these samples with each other or between the countries and only express plastic concentrations in these samples as a function of global plastic production and consumption we also do not take into consideration or account for any specific polymer flocculating agents that might have been used in the wwtps or biosolids treatment processes over the years 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism 8 and r studio 4 0 2 the concentration mg g dw biosolids of plastics was summed in each sample for all plastics types and the total plastics concentration was then fit with an exponential function for either the uk and australia separately or combined for the purposes of modeling the plastics concentration data below loq was substituted with loq 2 global plastic production estimates were gathered from statista 2020 and modelled with a second order polynomial as it had a better coefficient of variation than an exponential model as the data was only available for some years the data were extrapolated to each year from 1950 to 2016 using a linear spline function table s7 spearman and pearson correlations were calculated between each combination of three variables the available biosolids plastic concentrations the modelled global production data and the populations of the uk and australia in the respective years e g figure s1 s2 and s3 population estimates were gathered from macrotrends net 2020a macrotrends net 2020b there is some uncertainty for when some of the samples were collected see explanation in assumptions and limitations section and so the horizontal dotted lines of fig 1 s4 and fig 2 s5 represent the range in years when the samples were collected the boxplot has been placed at the mid point of the year estimate e g if late 1980s late 1990s then it was placed at 1993 with a 5 year range 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration of plastics in biosolids six of the target plastics were detected in the samples analyzed 59 archived samples and the 82 samples included from our previous study okoffo et al 2020b table s1 while polycarbonate was not detected in any sample lod 0 07 µg g the concentrations of total plastics 6plastics ranged from 0 01 to 14 mg g dry weight dw median 4 3 mg g dw polyethylene 0 01 10 mg g dw and polyvinyl chloride 0 02 4 6 mg g dw were the most abundant plastics followed by polyethylene terephthalate 0 02 2 0 mg g dw polyethylene was the most prevalent plastic in the biosolids contributing to 54 of the concentration of total plastics over the sampling period followed by polyvinyl chloride 26 polyethylene terephthalate 11 polypropylene 5 and polystyrene 3 while poly methyl methacrylate represented only 2 of the total the profile of plastics in the analyzed biosolids agrees with previous studies li et al 2018 lusher et al 2017 okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b polyethylene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate polyvinylchloride and polystyrene are all used as packaging materials andrady and neal 2009 geyer et al 2017 plasticseurope 2019 a large portion of these plastic products often have a relatively short service life reaching wwtps through their everyday use and via degradation and abrasion of plastics packaging materials browne et al 2011 geyer et al 2017 mather and wardman 2011 there was little difference in the plastics profile identified in the biosolids between australia and the uk with polyethylene polyvinyl chloride polyethylene terephthalate polypropylene polystyrene poly methyl methacrylate over the sampling period similarly there was no significant difference between the concentrations of plastic types between the two countries p 0 05 unpaired t test except for polyethylene and 6plastics p 0 05 likely driven by higher concentrations in australia in 2016 whereas the uk only had samples available up to 2009 none of the measured plastics were detected above their respective limit of quantification loqs in biosolids samples prior to the 1990s fig 1 fig s4 except for polystyrene in samples from 1955 1961 and the 1970s polypropylene polyvinyl chloride polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate were quantified in samples from the mid 1990s onwards while poly methyl methacrylate was only quantified in samples from the 2000s with the concentration of plastics increasing over time for each plastic fig 1 fig s4 table s1 the concentrations of polyethylene polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl chloride were the highest and showed an increasing trend from mid 1990s fig 1 fig s4 during the study period 1950 2016 the mean detected yearly concentration of polyethylene ranged from 0 6 0 6 to 7 4 1 6 polyvinyl chloride from 0 2 0 1 to 1 7 1 2 polyethylene terephthalate from 0 2 0 1 to 1 0 0 7 poly methyl methacrylate from 0 01 0 01 to 0 3 0 4 polypropylene from 0 2 0 1 to 0 3 0 3 and polystyrene from 0 01 to 0 3 0 3 mg g dw 3 2 plastic concentrations in biosolids compared with global production and consumption the total concentration of the six plastics 6plastics increased between the 1950s and 2016 fig 2 fig s5 the yearly sum of 6plastics ranged from 0 01 mg g dw in 1955 where only polystyrene was detected n 1 to 860 3 mg g dw in 2016 n 82 and continuously increased in the contemporary samples table s1 comparison with global plastic production data from 1950 to 2016 modelled data in table s7 table s8 statista 2020 fig 2 figure s5 illustrates that increases in production volume occurred at a similar rate to the increasing concentrations of plastics in biosolids spearman rho 0 995 pearson r 0 842 p 0 01 for uk and australian data combined table s9 figure s1 additionally the concentration of plastics increased at a similar rate as population growth for australia and the uk combined spearman rho 0 998 pearson r 0 802 p 0 01 table s9 figure s4 with a significant correlation also observed between population and global production of plastics spearman rho 0 995 pearson r 0 973 p 0 01 table s9 fig s5 macrotrends net 2020a b we show that global plastic production and consumption is closely correlated with concentrations in biosolids fig 2 fig s5 this implies a direct link between production consumption and leakage into the environment as has previously been observed for ocean plastic deposition brandon et al 2019 our data indicate that prior to the 1990s the leakage of plastics into sewers and thereafter biosolids was not a major issue from the 1990s plastics became detectable in biosolids increasing at a similar rate to production and consumption a large proportion of the increase in leakage is driven by polyethylene polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl chloride fig 1 fig s4 polyethylene both high and low density is the largest volume polymer used globally plasticseurope 2019 interestingly the production volumes and use of polyethylene increased rapidly in the 1990s especially in applications such as food and general packaging carrier bags consumer goods electronics and household goods presumably leading to the increased leakage into sewers since the mid 1990s synthetic polymers largely driven by the production of polyester have dominated the textile market surpassing cotton as the most commonly used fiber type suaria et al 2020 with effluents from laundering synthetic textiles directly released to wwtps through sewers wwtps have been identified as an important point source for polyester fibers salvador cesa et al 2017 sillanpää and sainio 2017 polyvinyl chloride production reached 61 mt in 2016 allsopp and vianello 2000 plastics insight 2020 from around 6 mt in 1970 johnson 1990 and its use in wastewater pipes building materials and furniture packaging electronics fiber for clothing etc allsopp and vianello 2000 plastics insight 2020 may have increased its leakage to the sewer and hence in biosolids over the sampling period fig 1 fig s1 expanded polystyrene eps was developed in 1954 and widely used as moldable packaging material e g cups and trays and insulation for buildings andrady and neal 2009 polystyrene was the only plastic type detected in samples prior to the 1990s i e in the 1955 1961 and 1970s samples fig 1 fig s4 suggesting its use in consumer products and direct releases into wastewater from the early 1950s poly methyl methacrylate used in optical lenses acrylic nails paint laptops smartphone displays screens interior and exterior panels canopies lcd screens personal care products furniture etc ali et al 2015 creative staff 2020 was only detected in samples from the 2000s onwards fig 1 fig s4 possibly implying that poly methyl methacrylate leakage may only be a more recent issue although polypropylene is one of the most versatile and extensively used polymers worldwide rogers 2020 second only to polyethylene in volume plasticseurope 2019 leakage into biosolids has only gradually increased over time in the samples analyzed fig 1 fig s4 given the lack of historical environmental pollution data for plastics archived environmental samples can provide a historical perspective on plastic leakage pathways into the environment and how these have evolved with changing plastics production and consumption use and populations there is a clear association between leakage and population data for australia and the uk figure s2 figure s3 suggesting that increasing population and a rise in the standard of living may have translated to increased plastic consumption and production despite the pervasiveness of plastics pollution we still lack a fundamental understanding of the extent and impacts of plastics leakage and the key pathways by which they enter the environment this is a serious concern because even under the most ambitious contemporary waste reduction scenarios contamination of the environment is predicted to continue to grow borrelle et al 2020 in the context of historical plastics leakage presented in this paper understanding is still needed on which products and uses resulted in the detected leakage this will help identify urgently needed source control interventions to reduce leakage and slow down the trend of increasing plastics in biosolids suggested source control options could include filters on washing machines eliminating banning substituting or reducing plastics in consumer products such as cosmetics personal care products and textiles and advocating reuse of plastic packaging products single use plastic bags or placing levies on single use plastic products borrelle et al 2020 hopewell et al 2020 lv et al 2019 magni et al 2019 consequently it is important to quantify the impacts of such practical interventions to validate their efficacy and design practical mitigation strategies for the future the impact of effective interventions also needs to be effectively communicated to facilitate the development of an evidence based plastic pollution reduction strategy 4 conclusion understanding the historical leakage of plastics into the environment and how this relates to production and consumption will support developing evidence based strategies to mitigate future plastics pollution here we explore archived biosolids from australia and the uk from between 1950 and 2016 and for the first time provide quantitative mass based concentration data for seven common plastics over a 70 year period we show that concentrations of plastics in biosolids closely correlate with plastic production and consumption we provide ground breaking data that shows that prior to the 1990s the leakage of plastics into sewers and thereafter biosolids was limited except for polystyrene with much of the increase in leakage from the 1990s onwards driven by increased production and consumption of polyethylene polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl chloride understanding this timeline and the changes that took place in society at this time will facilitate an understanding of how we can change as a society to reduce future leakage of plastics into the environment via this pathway data and materials availability all data needed to evaluate the conclusions of this study

2020b as global plastics production and consumption continues to increase without intervention the release of plastics to wastewater treatment plants wwtps will also likely increase hence more plastic will enter the environment via this pathway corradini et al 2019 okoffo et al 2020b rillig 2020 estimates suggest that annually 63 000 430 000 t mt and 44 000 300 000 mt of plastics may be added to farmlands in europe and north america respectively through the application of biosolids nizzetto et al 2016a nizzetto et al 2016b similarly it is estimated that about 4 700 mt of plastics are released into the australian environment through biosolids end use each year equating to a release of approximately 200 g person year okoffo et al 2020b there is potential for plastics released to land from biosolids end use to persist and accumulate in soils due to slow degradation and microbial assimilation corradini et al 2019 rolsky et al 2020 from here plastics may transfer to other environments

scientific research on plastics pollution is rapidly developing quantitative measurement of plastics in biosolids has been extremely challenging and as a result only a few studies have successfully extracted and quantified plastics in biosolids campo et al 2019 edo et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2021 using a number of different measurement techniques including microscopy raman microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir previous studies have provided particle count size shape color and partly polymer type related data in biosolids which may not reflect the total mass concentration of plastics in view of the limited mass based concentrations data and the recent concerns regarding the increasing consumption and release of plastics through biosolids there is a need to fully understand the release pathway of plastics into the environment on a mass concentration basis such data are also required to understand the plastics cycle from initial leakage from human

contamination of biosolids with plastics has changed with time in the context of increasing global plastic production and consumption is currently unknown the aim of this study was to quantify the concentration of plastics in biosolids from between 1950 and 2016 to evaluate the historical trend in plastics release and evaluate the relationship between the concentration of plastics in biosolids and global plastic production and consumption this was achieved through the analysis of archived and contemporary biosolids samples sourced from the united kingdom uk and australia from the 1950s to 2016 donner et al 2015 okoffo et al 2020b polystyrene polycarbonate poly methyl methacrylate polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride plastics were quantified in the historical biosolids samples constituting 70 of the plastics consumed worldwide plasticseurope 2019 the results of this study provide the first mass concentration based quantitative data of plastics contamination in biosolids over time thereby increasing our understanding of historical plastics leakage into wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals analytical

samples were acquired from a set of samples from the early 1950 s to 1990 s these samples have been previously analyzed for metals and were archived following use riche 1968 the historical uk samples were dried and stored at room temperature and atmosphere in sealed glass jars from the time of production and initial use until they were sub sampled for this study donner et al 2015 the historical australian biosolids from the 1970 s to 2009 were collected from a biosolids storage facility containing stockpiled samples from a large wastewater treatment plant donner et al 2015 it should be noted that some details on the date of production were not available from the historical australian dataset where the production date of n 4 samples could only be identified as a range of years see explanation in assumption and limitations section table s1 the biosolids at the facility were stored in open air stockpiles that were subjected to natural weathering processes from production to collection in 2009 donner et al 2015 for the contemporary 2009 and 2016 samples for the uk and australia targeted sampling campaigns were undertaken to assess samples from a range of wastewater treatment plant catchments donner et al 2015 o brien et al 2019 okoffo et al 2020b it should be noted that all samples from the 1950 2009 except the 2016 samples have been previously analyzed for non labile silver species and were archived following use until they were sub sampled for this study donner et al 2015 the 2016 australian biosolids samples data from our previously published work was

glass jars donner et al 2015 o brien et al 2019 okoffo et al 2020b together these historical and contemporary samples provide a glimpse into the past that can help us understand historical trends of plastics in biosolids 2 3 sample extraction and pyr gc ms analysis biosolids samples were extracted and analyzed processed following a validated method previously reported okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b briefly samples approximately 1 g each were milled to a fine powder with a commercial grinder for 30 min extech equipment pty ltd victoria australia following this each sample was weighed into a 5 ml pre cleaned ple stainless steel extraction cell and filled with pre cleaned hydromatrix cells were spiked with deuterated internal standards 200 µg of polystyrene d5 and polyethylene d4 1 mg ml in dichloromethane dcm and toluene respectively and extracted using dcm at 180 c and 1500 psi with a static time of 5 min using three extraction cycles all plastic sizes in biosolids samples were analyzed as samples were not sieved or pretreated prior to extractions hence the results are obtained for the total mass and entire particle size spectrum of plastics contamination in samples immediately after extraction 160 µl of each sample extract was transferred into pyrolysis cups eco cup lf frontier labs japan solvent evaporated for 30 mins in laminar flow cabinet for double shot pyr gc ms analysis using a multi shot micro furnace pyrolyzer ega py 3030d equipped with an auto shot sampler as 1020e both frontier labs japan and attached to a shimadzu gc ms qp2010 plus shimadzu corporation japan okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b detailed double shot pyr gc ms conditions are given in the supporting information table s2 the first pyrolysis shot ramped from 100 to 300 c of the double shot method was used as a clean up step to thermally desorb remove the potentially interfering volatile and semi volatile organic materials co extracted from biosolids samples with the second pyrolysis shot at 650 c used to quantitatively measure plastics identified in samples okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b to identify and quantify plastics in samples plastics specific indicator ions for polypropylene polystyrene polyethylene terephthalate poly methyl methacrylate polyvinyl chloride polycarbonate and polyethylene were selected as described and identified previously okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b summarized in table s3 s4 the method used in this study was optimized to resolve indicator ion selectivity i e against a number of organic materials and biogenic polymers natural materials thermal degradation solubility dissolution and stability of ple extracts and matrix related issues identified for several of the plastics in our previous research okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b details on these procedures can be found in our previous papers okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b ribeiro et al 2020 instrumental calibration was performed for the seven plastics by ple extracting plastic standards and aliquoting into pyrolysis cups 10 calibration points ranging from 0 05 to 50 µg cup having r2 0 95 table s4 calibration curves were made by plotting the peak area ratio of indicator ions to internal standard ions versus the concentration of each target plastic and using the integration results for quantification polyethylene d4 was used as an internal standard for polyethylene polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate while polystyrene d5 was used for poly methyl methacrylate polycarbonate and polyvinyl chloride due to similar extraction method recoveries all values reported in the study were corrected for recovery of the corresponding internal standard limits of detection lod and quantification loq for each plastic were calculated by multiplying the standard deviation of 7 replicate injections of the lowest calibration standard with 3 3 and 10 having a signal to noise ratio larger than 10 respectively table s4 2 4 quality assurance and quality control qa qc quality assurance and control steps were implemented to prevent contamination of samples all laboratory glassware and equipment were rinsed with liquid chromatography grade acetone followed by liquid chromatography grade dcm prior to use cotton laboratory coats were worn during all steps of analysis similarly glass or metal equipment were used when possible during laboratory procedures the work was performed in a laminar flow cabinet to minimize contamination by airborne plastics with samples covered with aluminum foil when not being processed all working areas were wiped down with 70 ethanol prior to starting experiments pressurized liquid extraction ple cells were sonicated with acetone and dcm prior to use to remove background plastic contamination prior to each ple extraction batch ple cells were conditioned to remove possible plastics contamination prior to pyr gc ms analysis system cleans no pyrolysis cups and blank cups were analyzed to demonstrate the absence of plastics contamination in the system all pyrolysis cups used in the study were new and washed in dcm before adding sample aliquots as a further cleaning step to avoid any possible contamination procedural blanks consisting of pre washed hydromatrix n 10 were treated as real samples and included in each batch of biosolids samples to undergo all procedures to monitor processing and extraction contamination instrumental blanks n 10 e g pure dcm solvent blank pyrolysis cups no pyrolysis cups as a system clean were included and analyzed in each batch of samples injected after every 10 samples to demonstrate the lack of cross contamination carryover of target plastics from sample to sample secondary contamination background response or potential instrument contamination to evaluate the risks of sample contamination during sample preparation and processing glass fiber filters whatman gf d n 10 were placed in the laminar flow cabinet and on the laboratory bench where samples were prepared these were treated extracted and analyzed in the same batch as biosolids samples in all laboratory and procedure blank samples plastic was either not detected or lower than the loqs table s5 to assess the reproducibility of the extraction and analysis methods over time an aliquot of a composite biosolids sample was extracted and analyzed with each batch of samples as a qaqc sample similarly ten duplicates of randomly selected biosolids samples were analyzed in different batches to assess the repeatability of the method and the relative standard deviation rsds of individual concentrations in qaqc and duplicate samples were 20 instrumental drift in sensitivity was checked by injecting a midpoint calibration standard after every 15 samples method recoveries of the individual plastics were assessed through spiking five replicates of biosolids samples plastics spiked into biosolids before extraction with between 20 and 100 µg of each plastic and 200 µg each of polystyrene d5 and polyethylene d4 internal standards and extracted following the above protocol average standard deviation absolute recoveries not internal standard recovery corrected were 107 16 polyethylene 103 18 poly methyl methacrylate 105 24 polystyrene 101 21 polyethylene terephthalate 98 18 polycarbonate 90 17 polypropylene and 102 25 polyvinyl chloride table s6 recoveries were estimated by comparing concentrations of plastics obtained from spiked samples with those of an un spiked sample subtracting the concentrations found in the un spiked sample okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b internal standard recoveries ranged from 82 polyethylene d4 to 96 polystyrene d5 2 5 assumptions and limitations there are a number of assumptions and limitations that need to be considered when interpreting this study uv irradiation and solar uv radiation are necessary to initiate photo oxidation of most polymers chamas et al 2020 uv radiation in sunlight causes oxidation of the polymer matrix resulting in chemical bond breakage napper and thompson 2020 in environments lacking both sunlight and oxygen degradation or weathering is unlikely to proceed naturally due to the high temperatures required ahmad et al 2015 chamas et al 2020 onwudili et al 2009 the archived biosolids samples used in this study were freeze dried air dried biosolids that were stored under ambient conditions and atmosphere in sealed glass jars until sub sampled hence weathering or polymer degradation due to uv radiation mechanical abrasion thermal and chemical action were not considered a major issue during sample storage as this was convenience sampling we could not take into account weathering of plastics before sampling but only after sampling and storage it should be noted that samples weren t available over the whole course of the 70 years timeframe 1950s to 2016 as these were obtained from archived samples some year groups were not available and samples were not equally distributed over the years table s1 this study gathered available samples by convenience and we acknowledge the limitations in our study regarding sample representativeness across the years however to the best of our knowledge no study has evaluated plastics concentrations in biosolids before 2010 okoffo et al 2019 additionally it is possible that no other biosolid samples over this timeframe exist in a sample archive elsewhere one should also note the uncertainty around when 4 of the samples 1970s early 1980s late 1980s late 1990s 1980s early 2000s and 1990s early 2000s see table s1 were collected where the exact year was not recorded in the archive but was listed as a range of years we have plotted the data to the midpoint of the possible date range of the year estimate e g if late 1980s late 1990s then it would be plotted as at 1993 with a 5 year range and plotted dotted lines to indicate when the samples could have come from it should also be noted that over time more biosolids may have been retained from wastewater as treatment processes have been improved and that the recovery of the mass of biosolids from wastewater including sources such as industry might have likely changed likewise a significant shift in biosolids production might have occurred over this period from minimal treatment to maximum energy extraction this will reduce overall solids and increase concentration of recalcitrant components like plastics therefore the continuously increasing concentrations of plastics in the contemporary samples may be influenced by the treatment processes being more effective in collecting plastics today than 1950s i e assessing the efficiency of the processes today compared to the 1950s however it was not possible to account for any changes in wastewater treatment processes over the years and there has been no analysis of change in processes over time during that time period in this study similarly we assume that the two countries uk and australia might have similar increasing plastics consumption trends to global plastic production rates translating directly to plastics reaching wastewater treatment plants biosolids over time nevertheless we cannot assume that wastewater treatment processes that generated biosolids have not changed since the 1950s and is the same between the two countries as such we do not seek to compare these samples with each other or between the countries and only express plastic concentrations in these samples as a function of global plastic production and consumption we also do not take into consideration or account for any specific polymer flocculating agents that might have been used in the wwtps or biosolids treatment processes over the years 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism 8 and r studio 4 0 2 the concentration mg g dw biosolids of plastics was summed in each sample for all plastics types and the total plastics concentration was then fit with an exponential function for either the uk and australia separately or combined for the purposes of modeling the plastics concentration data below loq was substituted with loq 2 global plastic production estimates were gathered from statista 2020 and modelled with a second order polynomial as it had a better coefficient of variation than an exponential model as the data was only available for some years the data were extrapolated to each year from 1950 to 2016 using a linear spline function table s7 spearman and pearson correlations were calculated between each combination of three variables the available biosolids plastic concentrations the modelled global production data and the populations of the uk and australia in the respective years e g figure s1 s2 and s3 population estimates were gathered from macrotrends net 2020a macrotrends net 2020b there is some uncertainty for when some of the samples were collected see explanation in assumptions and limitations section and so the horizontal dotted lines of fig 1 s4 and fig 2 s5 represent the range in years when the samples were collected the boxplot has been placed at the mid point of the year estimate e g if late 1980s late 1990s then it was placed at 1993 with a 5 year range 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration of plastics in biosolids six of the target plastics were detected in the samples analyzed 59 archived samples and the 82 samples included from our previous study okoffo et al 2020b table s1 while polycarbonate was not detected in any sample lod 0 07 µg g the concentrations of total plastics 6plastics ranged from 0 01 to 14 mg g dry weight dw median 4 3 mg g dw polyethylene 0 01 10 mg g dw and polyvinyl chloride 0 02 4 6 mg g dw were the most abundant plastics followed by polyethylene terephthalate 0 02 2 0 mg g dw polyethylene was the most prevalent plastic in the biosolids contributing to 54 of the concentration of total plastics over the sampling period followed by polyvinyl chloride 26 polyethylene terephthalate 11 polypropylene 5 and polystyrene 3 while poly methyl methacrylate represented only 2 of the total the profile of plastics in the analyzed biosolids agrees with previous studies li et al 2018 lusher et al 2017 okoffo et al 2020a okoffo et al 2020b polyethylene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate polyvinylchloride and polystyrene are all used as packaging materials andrady and neal 2009 geyer et al 2017 plasticseurope 2019 a large portion of these plastic products often have a relatively short service life reaching wwtps through their everyday use and via degradation and abrasion of plastics packaging materials browne et al 2011 geyer et al 2017 mather and wardman 2011 there was little difference in the plastics profile identified in the biosolids between australia and the uk with polyethylene polyvinyl chloride polyethylene terephthalate polypropylene polystyrene poly methyl methacrylate over the sampling period similarly there was no significant difference between the concentrations of plastic types between the two countries p 0 05 unpaired t test except for polyethylene and 6plastics p 0 05 likely driven by higher concentrations in australia in 2016 whereas the uk only had samples available up to 2009 none of the measured plastics were detected above their respective limit of quantification loqs in biosolids samples prior to the 1990s fig 1 fig s4 except for polystyrene in samples from 1955 1961 and the 1970s polypropylene polyvinyl chloride polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate were quantified in samples from the mid 1990s onwards while poly methyl methacrylate was only quantified in samples from the 2000s with the concentration of plastics increasing over time for each plastic fig 1 fig s4 table s1 the concentrations of polyethylene polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl chloride were the highest and showed an increasing trend from mid 1990s fig 1 fig s4 during the study period 1950 2016 the mean detected yearly concentration of polyethylene ranged from 0 6 0 6 to 7 4 1 6 polyvinyl chloride from 0 2 0 1 to 1 7 1 2 polyethylene terephthalate from 0 2 0 1 to 1 0 0 7 poly methyl methacrylate from 0 01 0 01 to 0 3 0 4 polypropylene from 0 2 0 1 to 0 3 0 3 and polystyrene from 0 01 to 0 3 0 3 mg g dw 3 2 plastic concentrations in biosolids compared with global production and consumption the total concentration of the six plastics 6plastics increased between the 1950s and 2016 fig 2 fig s5 the yearly sum of 6plastics ranged from 0 01 mg g dw in 1955 where only polystyrene was detected n 1 to 860 3 mg g dw in 2016 n 82 and continuously increased in the contemporary samples table s1 comparison with global plastic production data from 1950 to 2016 modelled data in table s7 table s8 statista 2020 fig 2 figure s5 illustrates that increases in production volume occurred at a similar rate to the increasing concentrations of plastics in biosolids spearman rho 0 995 pearson r 0 842 p 0 01 for uk and australian data combined table s9 figure s1 additionally the concentration of plastics increased at a similar rate as population growth for australia and the uk combined spearman rho 0 998 pearson r 0 802 p 0 01 table s9 figure s4 with a significant correlation also observed between population and global production of plastics spearman rho 0 995 pearson r 0 973 p 0 01 table s9 fig s5 macrotrends net 2020a b we show that global plastic production and consumption is closely correlated with concentrations in biosolids fig 2 fig s5 this implies a direct link between production consumption and leakage into the environment as has previously been observed for ocean plastic deposition brandon et al 2019 our data indicate that prior to the 1990s the leakage of plastics into sewers and thereafter biosolids was not a major issue from the 1990s plastics became detectable in biosolids increasing at a similar rate to production and consumption a large proportion of the increase in leakage is driven by polyethylene polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl chloride fig 1 fig s4 polyethylene both high and low density is the largest volume polymer used globally plasticseurope 2019 interestingly the production volumes and use of polyethylene increased rapidly in the 1990s especially in applications such as food and general packaging carrier bags consumer goods electronics and household goods presumably leading to the increased leakage into sewers since the mid 1990s synthetic polymers largely driven by the production of polyester have dominated the textile market surpassing cotton as the most commonly used fiber type suaria et al 2020 with effluents from laundering synthetic textiles directly released to wwtps through sewers wwtps have been identified as an important point source for polyester fibers salvador cesa et al 2017 sillanpää and sainio 2017 polyvinyl chloride production reached 61 mt in 2016 allsopp and vianello 2000 plastics insight 2020 from around 6 mt in 1970 johnson 1990 and its use in wastewater pipes building materials and furniture packaging electronics fiber for clothing etc allsopp and vianello 2000 plastics insight 2020 may have increased its leakage to the sewer and hence in biosolids over the sampling period fig 1 fig s1 expanded polystyrene eps was developed in 1954 and widely used as moldable packaging material e g cups and trays and insulation for buildings andrady and neal 2009 polystyrene was the only plastic type detected in samples prior to the 1990s i e in the 1955 1961 and 1970s samples fig 1 fig s4 suggesting its use in consumer products and direct releases into wastewater from the early 1950s poly methyl methacrylate used in optical lenses acrylic nails paint laptops smartphone displays screens interior and exterior panels canopies lcd screens personal care products furniture etc ali et al 2015 creative staff 2020 was only detected in samples from the 2000s onwards fig 1 fig s4 possibly implying that poly methyl methacrylate leakage may only be a more recent issue although polypropylene is one of the most versatile and extensively used polymers worldwide rogers 2020 second only to polyethylene in volume plasticseurope 2019 leakage into biosolids has only gradually increased over time in the samples analyzed fig 1 fig s4 given the lack of historical environmental pollution data for plastics archived environmental samples can provide a historical perspective on plastic leakage pathways into the environment and how these have evolved with changing plastics production and consumption use and populations there is a clear association between leakage and population data for australia and the uk figure s2 figure s3 suggesting that increasing population and a rise in the standard of living may have translated to increased plastic consumption and production despite the pervasiveness of plastics pollution we still lack a fundamental understanding of the extent and impacts of plastics leakage and the key pathways by which they enter the environment this is a serious concern because even under the most ambitious contemporary waste reduction scenarios contamination of the environment is predicted to continue to grow borrelle et al 2020 in the context of historical plastics leakage presented in this paper understanding is still needed on which products and uses resulted in the detected leakage this will help identify urgently needed source control interventions to reduce leakage and slow down the trend of increasing plastics in biosolids suggested source control options could include filters on washing machines eliminating banning substituting or reducing plastics in consumer products such as cosmetics personal care products and textiles and advocating reuse of plastic packaging products single use plastic bags or placing levies on single use plastic products borrelle et al 2020 hopewell et al 2020 lv et al 2019 magni et al 2019 consequently it is important to quantify the impacts of such practical interventions to validate their efficacy and design practical mitigation strategies for the future the impact of effective interventions also needs to be effectively communicated to facilitate the development of an evidence based plastic pollution reduction strategy 4 conclusion understanding the historical leakage of plastics into the environment and how this relates to production and consumption will support developing evidence based strategies to mitigate future plastics pollution here we explore archived biosolids from australia and the uk from between 1950 and 2016 and for the first time provide quantitative mass based concentration data for seven common plastics over a 70 year period we show that concentrations of plastics in biosolids closely correlate with plastic production and consumption we provide ground breaking data that shows that prior to the 1990s the leakage of plastics into sewers and thereafter biosolids was limited except for polystyrene with much of the increase in leakage from the 1990s onwards driven by increased production and consumption of polyethylene polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl chloride understanding this timeline and the changes that took place in society at this time will facilitate an understanding of how we can change as a society to reduce future leakage of plastics into the environment via this pathway data and materials availability all data needed to evaluate the conclusions of this study

16891,ozonation is among the currently used technologies to remove chemical and biological contaminants from secondary treated urban wastewater uww despite its effectiveness on the abatement of organic micropollutants omps and disinfection previous studies have shown that regrow of bacteria may occur upon storage of the ozonated uww this reactivation has been attributed to the high content of assimilable organic carbon after treatment in order to investigate if ozonation by products are the main biological regrowth drivers in stored ozonated uww the ozonation surviving cells were resuspended in sterile bottled mineral water mw simulating a pristine oligotrophic environment after 7 days storage organisms such as acinetobacter methylobacterium cupriavidus massilia acidovorax and pseudomonas were dominant in both ozonated uww and pristine mw demonstrating that bacterial regrowth is not strictly related to the eventual presence of ozonation by products but instead with the ability of the surviving cells to cope with nutrient poor environments the resistome of uww before and after ozonation was analysed by metagenomic techniques draft metagenome assembled genomes dmags recovered from both ozonated uww and after cell resuspension in mw harboured genes conferring resistance to diverse antibiotics classes some of these antibiotic resistance genes args were located in the vicinity of mobile genetic elements suggesting their potential to be mobilized among these dmags affiliated to taxa with high relative abundance in stored water such as p aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp harboured args conferring resistance to 12 and 4 families of antibiotics respectively including those encoding carbapenem hydrolysing oxacillinases the results herein obtained point out that the design and development of new wastewater treatment technologies should include measures to attenuate the imbalance of the bacterial communities promoted by storage of the final treated

al 2011 however little attention has been given to the effect of aots on the dynamics of the bacterial communities and the uww resistomes becerra castro et al 2016 garrido cardenas et al 2017 hembach et al 2019 jäger et al 2018 moreira et al 2018 stamps et al 2018 previous studies demonstrated that cells surviving to a given aot are capable of regrowth in stored treated water to levels similar to those found before that treatment becerra castro et al 2016 malvestiti and dantas 2018 moreira et al 2016 2018 narcisoda rocha et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 moreover this regrowth was shown to be accompanied by the potential selection of some bacterial groups and the reduction of bacterial diversity strong predominance of organisms belonging to proteobacteria namely pseudomonas and acinetobacter have been found after treatment with different aots including ozonation and solar driven technologies alexander et al 2016 becerra castro et al 2016 jäger et al 2018 moreira et al 2018 these genera are characterized by harbouring opportunistic pathogens lyczak et al 2000 munoz price and weinstein 2008 moreover some strains of these genera were shown to be resistant against a wide range of the existing antibiotic classes and to have the capacity to acquire new resistance determinants dijkshoorn et al 2007 hwang and yoon 2019 therefore even though the high efficiency of aots on the degradation or even mineralization of the organic matter the predominance of these organisms in stored treated wastewater is undesirable for instance if its reuse in agriculture irrigation is envisaged the risk of transmission of potentially hazardous bacteria to humans due to irrigation with water with poor microbiological quality is of particular importance for vegetables eaten raw becerra castro et al 2015 the lack of residual concentration of disinfectant species together with the generation of oxidation by products have been pointed out as the main factors contributing to the reactivation of injured microorganisms when aots are applied becerra castro et al 2016 papageorgiou et al 2014 for instance carbonyl compounds along with carboxylic acids have been reported to represent about 30 of the ozonation by products richardson 2003 the metabolic versatility of pseudomonas and acinetobacter which have been shown to have the capacity to degrade carbonyl compounds johnson et al 2011 keil et al 1983 razika et al 2010 shao et al 2015 wilkes and aristilde 2017 wu et al 2018 may bring selective advantage of these organisms over others to survive in ozonated uww in this context the present study aimed at investigating if the by products formed during the ozonation of uwwtp effluents are the main drivers of the abovementioned disturbances occurring in stored treated uww given the wide diversity of by products expected to be formed at low concentration during ozonation instead of monitoring their biodegradation the behavior of cells surviving ozonation in a non human impacted environment with low concentration of naturally occurring organic compounds was assessed to achieve this goal the ozonated uww was split into two aliquots one of the aliquots was directly stored for 7 days the second aliquot was filtered and the cells were resuspended in sterile still mineral water mw with values of dissolved organic carbon 5 to 15 times lower than those commonly found in ozonated wastewater e g lesaulnier et al 2017 iakovides et al 2019 in this study mw simulated the effluent of a hypothetical and ideal treatment process capable of transforming wastewater into pristine oligotrophic water in terms of chemical composition reactivation and bacterial community disturbance occurring in the stored samples were compared in addition potential arbs were identified in each sample through the search of args in the recovered draft metagenome assembled genomes dmags to the best of our knowledge this is the first study assessing the capacity of bacteria surviving ozonation to colonize pristine nutrient poor environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the omps reference standards of 98 purity alachlor atrazine bezafibrate

water system millipore 2 2 uww and mw samples all experiments were performed using fresh samples collected in a uwwtp located in northern portugal which serves a population equivalent of 17 000 inhabitants with an average flow rate of 3400 m3 d 1 the treatment process consists of a preliminary treatment which includes trash racking and desanding dredging and a primary clarification step followed by a conventional activated sludge system grab uww samples were collected from the secondary clarifier into sterile glass bottles on three independent sampling occasions these samples herein named ww0 were immediately transported to the laboratory and processed the ww0 physicochemical characterization can be found in table s1 mw samples were obtained from a portuguese commercial brand the mw physicochemical characterization can be found in table s2 prior to use the mw samples were sterilized by autoclaving at 121 c for 20 min twice independent sterilizations sterility was confirmed by filtering 100 ml of autoclaved mw through cellulose nitrate membranes 0 22 μm porosity whatman uk the filtering membranes were incubated on plate count agar pca merck at 30 c for 7 days moreover no total dna could be quantified in 1 l of autoclaved mw 2 3 experimental design and ozonation set up a flow through reactor operating under continuous mode was used to perform ozonation experiments fig 1 a a complete description of the reactor configuration and optimization as well as the determination of the time required to achieve the steady state is described elsewhere iakovides et al 2019 briefly the experimental apparatus consists of a bubble column reactor 3 0 cm internal diameter 70 cm height useful volume of approximately 310 ml packed with glass rings to promote the contact between the gas and liquid phase graça et al 2020a and with a continuous entrance of ww0 at the bottom of the column and a continuous outlet stream wwt0 at the top of this column gas washing bottles filled with potassium iodide solution were used to remove the ozone leaving the reactor in the gas phase the efficiency of the process was estimated after achieving the steady state for a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 min an ozone dose of 10 mg o3 l 1 measured in the liquid phase by the indigo colorimetric method bader and hoigné 1981 was selected to perform ozonation experiments considering a previous optimization study iakovides et al 2019 according to the dissolved organic carbon doc values of ww0 table s1 specific ozone doses varied between 0 5 1 go3 gdoc 1 average value of 0 7 0 2 go3 gdoc 1 which are values commonly found in the literature for the treatment of uww including at full scale borowska et al 2016 bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2016 schollée et al 2018 these specific ozone dose and hrt 10 mg o3 l 1 and 20 min respectively were selected in the present study to mimic real conditions as increasing these values leads to excessive capital and operating costs at the selected conditions it is possible to disinfect the wastewater efficiently but regrowth has been frequently observed iakovides et al 2019 graça et al 2020b after treatment each sample was bubbled with air under sterile conditions for 30 min aiming to remove residual ozone the gas stream was sterilized by passing air through two sterilized ptfe filter membranes

simpson 1949 beta diversity was assessed using the generalized unifrac distance chen et al 2012 and the dissimilarities among samples were depicted by the principal coordinate analysis pcoa biplot the metagenome sequencing project consisted of the sequencing assembling and annotation of metagenome pools each dna pool consisted of the equimolar mixture of high quality total dna from a given type of sample collected at three independent dates given the low concentration of dna in the wwt0 samples only 5 metagenome pools were considered ww0 ww0 1 ww0 2 ww0 3 ww7 ww7 1 ww7 2 ww7 3 cww0 mw7 cww0 mw7

each dmag are shown in tables s3 and s4 for the annotation of args in the resulting dmag assembled contigs the resistance gene identifier of the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card database release 3 0 9 08 06 20 alcock et al 2020 was used only coding dna sequences cdss showing a strict or perfect match with the arg references of this database were considered the perfect algorithm detects antimicrobial resistance amr proteins with an exact 100 match to a card reference sequence while the strict algorithm is more flexible allowing for variation from the card reference sequence as long as the sequence falls within the curated blast bit score cut offs and is useful for detecting previously unknown variants of amr genes or antibiotic targets altered via mutation alcock et al 2020 the presence of mobile genetic elements namely dna transposable sequences was searched in the mag contigs by manual inspection of the 30 open reading frames upstream and downstream of each identified arg and their corresponding annotations in artemis carver et al 2008 2012 2 8 statistical analysis microbial counts were compared using one way anova and the post hoc tukey test past v4 0 software hammer et al 2001 the permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova based on generalized unifrac distances was performed using past v4 0 hammer et al 2001 to evaluate if the bacterial communities were grouped by sample and if there were statistically different groups within the analysed bacterial communities 2 9 data availability demultiplexed sequences and metadata are available from the sequence read archives sra under accession number prjna665486 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of organic micropollutants among the 14 omps analysed table s1 the pesticides atrazine simazine and methiocarb were below the limit of detection lod in all the three ww0 samples in contrast the pesticide isoproturon 2 1 69 6 ng l 1 and the fluorosurfactant pfos 108 249 ng l 1 were quantified in all the ww0 samples the concentrations of the other analysed omps varied from values below limits of quantification loq up to the highest concentration 9 µg l 1 that was found for the antidepressant citalopram the ozonation treatment led to the removal of omps over 80 except for alachlor 75 11 fig 2 these removal rates are similar to those obtained in several studies applying low ozone concentrations doses bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 iakovides et al 2019 schollée et al 2018 and to the threshold values to comply the requirements of the swiss water protection act which is the only national legislation regulating the concentration of omps in effluents of uwwtps eggen et al 2014 foen 2015 besides the omps herein studied the uww contains a variety of other organic compounds the doc removal was found to vary between 14 and 35 rendering ozonated wastewater with a final doc content of 10 7 2 1 mg l 1 values in line with those reported in the literature for uww after ozonation iakovides et al 2019 3 2 bacterial load removal and reactivation as expected ozonation led to the reduction of the targeted cultivable bacterial groups analysed total heterotrophs and pseudomonads from 105 cfu ml 1 to levels close or below the loq 0 33 10 2 cfu ml 1 immediately after treatment wwt0 fig 3 a b during storage reactivation of the cultivable cells surviving ozonation to levels comparable to those occurring in ww0 was consistently observed in the three wwt7 replicates i e wwt7 1 3 fig 3a b as reported elsewhere moreira et al 2018 2016 sousa et al 2017 when the cells surviving ozonation were transferred into sterile mw cwwt0 mw7 they were also able to regrow to levels similar to those occurring in ww0 in one sampling campaign cwwt0 mw7 1 whereas regrowth was not observed or reached levels lower than those occurring in ww0 in the two other campaigns fig 3a b the quantification of the 16s rrna gene herein used to estimate the abundance of total bacteria per volume of sample corroborated these findings fig 3c 3 3 bacterial community structure and composition to identify the bacterial groups capable of surviving ozonation and eventually regrow upon storage a 16s rrna gene sequence based community analysis was carried out as can be observed in the pcoa biplot storage of ww0 ww7 or storage of cells from ww0 resuspended in sterile mw cww0 mw7 did not significantly change the structure and composition of the bacterial communities fig 4 group i p 0 05 indeed proteobacteria bacteroidetes and candidatus parcubacteria od1 were the major phyla found in ww0 as well as in the non ozonated control samples with average relative abundances varying between 18 36 17 32 and 14 28 respectively fig 5 a in addition all of these samples harboured a wide diversity of genera and families most of them with abundances lower than 2 or 5 respectively fig 5b figure s1 in contrast ozone treatment followed by storage wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 led to significant bacterial community rearrangements and loss of bacterial diversity fig 4 group ii p 0 05 fig 5 in these samples proteobacteria was almost the only phylum detected 98 8 1 8 and 97 1 4 6 in wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 respectively fig 5a moreover these samples were dominated by a few genera between 3 and 8 which constituted 89 99 and 95 99 of the total abundance found in wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 respectively fig 5b the loss of diversity and equability is corroborated by the lower values of the alpha diversity indices of the wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 samples when compared to those found in non ozonated samples table 1 the exact bacterial composition of each of the three analysed samples of wwt7 differed wwt7 1 wwt7 2 and wwt7 3 harboured 20 22 and 69 genera respectively which represent between 2 4 and 8 7 of the total genera found in the corresponding ww0 1 3 samples only acinetobacter and comamonas were found in all the wwt7 samples despite their variable abundance in each sample figure s2 other genera such as pseudomonas brevundimonas methylobacterium rhizobium microbacterium and mycobacterium were found in two out of the three wwt7 samples figure s2 hence most of the genera were detected in only one wwt7 sample from these cupriavidus acidovorax and massilia were among the most abundant figure s2 this variability was also observed in the cwwt0 mw7 samples cwwt0 mw7 1 cwwt0 mw7 2 and cwwt0 mw7 3 harboured 58 45 and 54 genera respectively out of which 52 to 85 were not detected in the correspondent wwt7 samples examples are human gut commensals of genera enterobacter escherichia cwwt0 mw7 1 cwwt0 mw7 3 and faecalibacterium cwwt0 mw7 2 which were found at relative abundances lower than 0 01 data not shown each bacterial community of the cwwt0 mw7 samples was dominated by 4 or 5 different genera figs 5b and s2 among these only acinetobacter methylobacterium cupriavidus and massilia were present at high relative abundance in both cwwt0 mw7 and the correspondent wwt7 sample bradyrhizobium and phenylobacterium were also found in both type of samples but at higher abundance in cwwt0 mw7 than in wwt7 samples other abundant genera included sphingomonas zoogloea deinococcus acidovorax and pseudomonas which except the last two were found in low abundance in non correspondent wwt7 samples figure s2 interestingly a high relative abundance of organisms affiliated to pseudomonas was sporadic detected in contrast with the high abundance of cultivable bacteria grown on pia particularly in the wwt7 samples fig 5a indeed the 16s rrna gene sequence based analysis of the dna extracted from the biomass grown on this selective medium revealed that pia was able to recover a wide diversity of bacteria besides pseudomonadaceae examples are enterobacteriaceae bacillaceae and brucellaceae which despite their low abundance in the 16s rrna libraries directly recovered from the wastewater samples figure s1 showed high abundance in the correspondent libraries recovered from the biomass grown on pia figure s3a in addition pia was also able to recover the abundant organisms retrieved from the correspondent wastewater 16s rrna libraries such as aeromonas in the non ozonated samples and acinetobacter acidovorax and cupriavidus in the ozonated samples figure s3b although knowing that selective media may recover organisms present at very low abundance in the community vaz moreira et al 2011 these results indicate that pia was not able to selectively recover the initially targeted bacterial group 3 4 identification of bacteria harbouring args the reactivation of args conferring resistance to different classes of antibiotics in stored ozonated wastewater was reported before becerra castro et al 2016 iakovides et al 2019 sousa et al 2017 however these studies did not evaluate which organisms were carrying the quantified args to overcome this difficulty in the present study a shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach followed by binning was carried out to recover the mags present in each type of analysed samples this procedure allowed to recover the dmags of the minority 0 8 8 4 of the otus present in the respective pooled samples mainly from those with high diversity and richness ww0 ww7 and cww0 mw7 tables 1 s3 and s4 moreover possibly because of the high abundance of closely related organisms present in the samples none of the recovered dmags fulfilled the criteria proposed for high quality mags bowers et al 2017 nevertheless excepting one no 19 of pool cww0 mw7 table s4 the 98 recovered dmags showed completeness higher than 70 1 and contamination lower than 8 3 table s4 being thus considered of medium quality bowers et al 2017 the difficulties in the binning of the metagenome data from samples with high richness and diversity could also be noticed when analysing the identification of each recovered dmag approximately 71 of the 17 and 38 dmags retrieved from the ww0 and ww7 pools respectively could be identified at the order or higher taxonomic ranks only whereas 75 and 56 of the 8 and 9 dmags recovered from the wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 pools respectively could be identified at the genus or species level figure s4 in order to estimate the abundance of each dmag in each analysed pool the same taxon or the taxon of the immediate above rank was searched for in the corresponding 16s rrna gene sequence libraries table s4 as reported before it was possible to conclude that the binning of the metagenome data could assemble the genomes of organisms present in a wide range of abundances bowers et al 2017 even in the pool of samples with the highest diversity indices ww0 indeed it was possible to assemble dmags of organisms affiliated to taxa such as arcobacter and spirochaetia for which abundances reaching 14 or not exceeding 0 4 in the ww0 1 3 samples were respectively obtained table s4 moreover for 6 out of the 13 genera with abundances higher than 2 in the 16s rrna gene sequence libraries of the wwt7 1 3 samples it was possible to retrieve a dmag identified at the same taxonomic or even lower rank pseudomonas aeruginosa figures s2 and s5 table s4 the two other dmags recovered from this pool were only identified at the family level comamonadaceae and oxalobacteraceae these families respectively include comamonas and massilia which were found in the wwt7 1 3 samples at high abundance figure s2 table s4 from the cwwt0 mw7 1 3 pool dmags affiliated to 5 out of the 11 genera with abundances higher than 2 in the 16s rrna gene sequence libraries were retrieved figure s2 table s4 from these samples dmags identified at the family or order to which massilia sphingomonas and zoogloea belong were also respectively recovered figure s2 table s4 in addition a dmag identified as belonging to alicycliphilus a member of comamonadaceae one of the abundant families recovered from cwwt0 mw7 1 figure s1 was also obtained table s4 among the dmags recovered from all the analysed pools only a minority 4 to 25 harboured cdss with a strict or perfect match with reference args of the card database table 2 some of these args were located nearby mobile genetic elements such as integrases and transposases table 2 suggesting the potential of these args to be mobilized genes conferring resistance to last generation beta lactams were found in aeromonas which constituted 2 of the total abundance in ww0 indeed extended spectrum beta lactamases and carbapenemases have been detected in both aeromonas clinical and environmental isolates bogaerts et al 2017 piotrowska et al 2017 these traits have been crucial to consider these ubiquitous bacteria as potential vectors of antibiotic resistance piotrowska et al 2017 varela and manaia 2013 despite the capacity of ozonation to reduce the abundance of aeromonas fig 5b the ozonated wastewater harboured other arg carriers in wwt7 as expected p aeruginosa which constituted up to 13 of the total abundance in wwt7 3 figure s5 harboured args conferring resistance to 12 families of antibiotics most of the args found in the p aeruginosa dmag encode efflux pumps conferring multi resistance although others conferring inactivation of different antimicrobials were also detected table 2 indeed p aeruginosa is described as able to intrinsically express numerous efflux pumps conferring resistance to multiple antibiotics and disinfectants pang et al 2019 along with a wide diversity of transferases able to inactive antibiotics such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones pang et al 2019 moreover p aeruginosa is also known to encode chromosomic oxa carbapanemases and inducible cephalosporinases barnes et al 2018 walther rasmussen and høiby 2006 the ozonation treatment also selected for acinetobacter figs 5b s2 as expected the dmags related to this genus recovered from both wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 also harboured genes encoding carbapenem hydrolysing oxacillinases indeed the bla oxa 211 gene has been naturally found in a johnsonii figueiredo et al 2012 which constituted up to 11 of the total abundance found in cwwt0 mw7 1 also the bla oxa 275 gene which encodes a cephalosporinase has been detected in a guillouiae périchon et al 2014 one of the acinetobacter species found in the wwt7 pool at abundances reaching 26 table 2 figure s5 from the 17 arg gene families detected only four arg from the antibiotic resistant rpsl antibiotic resistant mura transferase rbpa bacterial rna polymerase binding protein and sulfonamide resistant sul showed higher prevalence in ww0 or in the non treated controls ww7 cww0 mw7 2 6 to 5 9 than in the ozonated samples wwt7 cwwt0 mw7 where no gene of these families was found table s5 in contrast 9 out of the 17 arg gene families were not detected in ww0 or in the non treated controls among the 13 gene families detected in the treated samples aph 3 ii and beta lactamase contained args with highest prevalence in cwwt0 mw7 11 1 and 55 5 respectively whereas the args of the remaining 11 families were more prevalent in wwt7 with relative abundances ranging from 12 5 to more than 100 for the resistance nodulation cell division antibiotic efflux pump family table s5 3 5 potential risks related to storage of ozonated uww the overall analysis of the results herein obtained suggests that the oxidative stress promoted by the ozonation treatment acts stochastically upon the wastewater microbiota leading to a transitory decrease of the bacterial load as reported before alexander et al 2016 becerra castro et al 2016 cui et al 2020 jäger et al 2018 disinfection processes may render surviving cells to a viable but non cultivable state which reverts when the stress status is relieved leading to bacterial reactivation amarasiri et al 2019 however the low content of total dna in wwt0 suggests that other mechanisms may underpin the observed regrowth upon storage of the treated wastewater the occurrence of microbial regrowth after treatment by aots has been attributed to the capacity of surviving cells to use any available carbon and energy sources such as non oxidized organic matter and reaction by products thayanukul et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 in fact the implementation of a subsequent adsorption treatment step has been recommended to minimize the release of compounds generated during ozonation rizzo et al 2020 in this study to assess the contribution of the organic matter in the effluent treated by ozonation including reaction by products on the capacity of surviving cells to regrow upon storage the cells surviving ozonation were simultaneously stored in the ozonated wastewater and in sterile mineral water in the first environment the surviving cells could tolerate or eventually use non degraded organic matter of the original uww and or ozone by products in contrast the sterile mineral water by one hand was free of any micropollutant or oxidation by product and by the another hand contained naturally occurring organic matter at a concentration approximately 10 fold lower than that of the ozonated wastewater wwt0 supplementary tables 1 and 2 hence it simulated a pristine oligotrophic environment as those hypothetically achieved if ozonation or any other water treatment technology could transform secondary treated wastewater into spring water the levels of total and cultivable bacteria restored upon storage in both ozonated wastewater wwt7 and mineral water cwwt0 mw7 indicating that bacterial reactivation cannot be directly attributed to the presence of assimilable ozonation reaction by products instead it seems to be related to the capacity of the surviving cells to cope with conditions prevailing in nutrient poor environments indeed the non ozonated ww0 cells were also able to survive upon storage in sterile mw fig 3 cww0 mw7 these results are in line with those observed upon bottling of still mineral water the so called bottle effect leclerc and moreau 2002 lesaulnier et al 2017 the capacity of total bacteria colonizing the source water aquifer 103 cells ml 1 to grow up to 105 106 cells ml 1 within few days after bottling is well known e g leclerc and moreau 2002 egli 2010 lesaulnier et al 2017 however the mechanisms underpinning such capacity are still poorly understood leclerc and moreau 2002 lesaulnier et al 2017 nevertheless experimental evidence suggested that carbon concentration in the range of 1 to 100 µg l 1 is sufficient to enable bacterial growth and it is estimated that only 0 5 to 5 of the 0 5 5 mg l 1 total dissolved organic matter available in oligotrophic waters such as underground drinking and surface waters is sufficient to attain microbial loads of 104 106 cells ml 1 as those typically found in these environments eli 2010 lesaulnier et al 2017 indeed the estimated assimilable organic carbon of cww0 mw7 1 sample where regrowth of total heterotrophs was most notorious fig 3 was 1 55 µgc l 1 a value close to the average calculated for the wwt7 samples 1 66 µgc l 1 supplementary table s6 which corresponded to 0 13 and 0 01 of the total dissolved organic matter of mw and wwt7 respectively the bottleneck promoted by ozonation also led to the decrease of the bacterial diversity of the stored water to very low levels independent of the exact chemical composition of the water in contrast to the microbial load richness and diversity kept low even after 7 days as reported before alexander et al 2016 becerra castro et al 2016 cui et al 2020 jäger et al 2018 interestingly similar findings were reported by lesaulnier et al 2017 who observed loss of diversity and the dominance of only 1 to 15 otus affiliated to betaproteobacteria among the rich bacterial community of non carbonated mineral water after bottling although also confirming proteobacteria as the phylum harbouring bacteria able to survive ozonation and regrow upon storage becerra castro et al 2016 the results obtained demonstrated that most of the organisms surviving ozonation and storage differed according to the sampling and treatment day which suggests some degree of stochasticity these changes might be related to the original composition of the raw secondary wastewater ww0 the degree of susceptibility of the surviving cells to the stress factors imposed by ozonation and or the ability of some cell lineages to outcompete the remaining surviving microorganisms under the prevailing conditions despite this stochasticity survivors of ozonation capable of reaching high abundance in the presence of reaction products included organisms belonging to acidovorax acinetobacter brevundimonas comamonas cupriavidus methylobacterium massilia and pseudomonas such results suggest that these organisms through improved mechanisms to cope with nutrient poor environments had a competitive advantage and become predominant indeed these bacteria are described to inhabit oligotrophic environments such as drinking water bruno et al 2018 donofrio et al 2010 gallego et al 2006 narcisoda rocha et al 2013 rice et al 2000 van assche et al 2019 vaz moreira et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 the capacity to tolerate disinfectants in organisms of the genera methylobacterium and cupriavidus kovaleva et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 or to form protecting structures such as biofilms in pseudomonas and methylobacterium kovaleva et al 2014 vaz moreira et al 2012 have been pointed out as traits favouring their ability to cope with the conditions prevailing in disinfected water such as in drinking water distribution systems organisms of some of the most abundant genera found in wwt7 are also described as capable of mineral water colonization e g acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas spp including pseudomonas aeruginosa bartram et al 2003 leclerc and moreau 2002 hence it is not surprising to find high abundance of these organisms in still mineral water cwwt0 mw7 as well to survive or even regrow in nutrient poor environments such as stored ozonated wastewater or sterile mineral water the organisms of these genera may have one or more mechanisms to cope with the reduced amount of energy and carbon sources previous studies carried out in oligotrophic environments have shown that cells may adopt different strategies to overcome the lack of nutrients one strategy is to enter a starvation physiological survival state which allows the cells to survive but hampers reproduction or induce very low growth rates gray et al 2019 leclerc and moreau 2002 the cells under starvation are usually smaller in order to increase the surface volume ratio and thus sequester nutrients more efficiently leclerc and moreau 2002 some of these bacteria may enter a viable but non culturable state leclerc and moreau 2002 li et al 2014 which may eventually be restored in the presence of nutrients such as when herein plated on pia nutritive media e g brucellaceae enterobacteriaceae figure s3 or transferred into another environmental compartment e g surface water bulk or rhizosphere soil organisms capable of accumulating reserve polymers may also surpass the lack of nutrients with those able to use the reserve macromolecules at a slow rate showing an advantage over other bacteria leclerc and moreau 2002 hence the ability to accumulate poly β hydroxybutyrate and polyphosphate achbergerová and nahálka 2011 mozejko ciesielska et al 2019 schembri et al 1994 zago et al 1999 may have favoured the survival and regrowth of acinetobacter spp and p aeruginosa in both wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 samples other mechanisms of survival and regrowth in highly competitive nutrient poor environments are related to the ability of some bacteria to produce transport systems with increased affinities for nutrients or to the capacity to express transport and metabolic systems for a wide diversity of alternative nutrients eli 2010 leclerc and moreau 2002 lesaulnier et al 2017 mahnert et al 2019 ozonation of some recalcitrant organic pollutants can render more readily metabolizable nutrients van leeuwen et al 2009 hence versatile metabolic organisms such as those belonging to genera acidovorax acinetobacter cupriavidus massilia methylobacterium and pseudomonas would benefit from the presence of ozone by products in wwt7 becoming dominant in the ozonated wastewater bacterial community in addition the ability of these organisms to live in pristine oligotrophic environments allowed their development in still mineral water cwwt0 mw7 as well in contrast organisms belonging to bradyrhizobium phenylobacterium sphingomonas zoogloea and deinococcus although surviving ozonation seem to recover when transferred into pristine environments cwwt0 mw7 interestingly bacteria subjected to nutrients limitation may become tolerant to stressful conditions namely to antibiotics and oxidative stress fung et al 2010 gray et al 2019 leclerc and moreau 2002 mahnert et al 2019 in this study we demonstrated that among the organisms surviving ozonation and becoming dominant in stored ozonated wastewater are those related to the ubiquitous opportunistic pathogens acinetobacter spp and p aeruginosa diggle and whiteley 2020 périchon et al 2014 indeed p aeruginosa and a baumannii have been described to be less affected by ozonation and to persist after treatment alexander et al 2016 hembach et al 2019 in addition we demonstrated that these organisms harbor intrinsic resistance to different classes of antibiotics namely to last generation beta lactams consequently high prevalence of acinetobacter spp and p aeruginosa is undesirable in stored treated wastewater mainly if its reuse in the irrigation of eaten raw vegetables is envisaged given the inability of the binning and assembling methods herein used to recover most of the shotgun metagenomic data obtained tables s3 and s4 most probably the surviving organisms harboured a much richer resistome than that retrieved from the dmags particularly the difficulties in the assemblage binning of plasmids chen et al 2020 hampered the identification of args potentially involved in horizontal gene transference nevertheless organisms of both genera pseudomonas partridge et al 2018 and acinetobacter salto et al 2018 are known to carry plasmids eventually harbouring args hence further plasmidomic studies are necessary to identify the risk of reusing stored ozonated wastewater in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance determinants through conjugation the results of the present study point out the necessity to rethink wastewater treatment targets towards a more enlightened design and implementation of advanced full scale processes i e that may attenuate the imbalance of the bacterial communities in treated wastewater this is particularly relevant when treated wastewater is stored for reuse in irrigation of crops and where the overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria should be avoided applying treatments with high mineralization rates may not be a solution as herein demonstrated alternatively restoring the phylogenetic and functional microbial diversity of the treated wastewater through mixing with pristine surface water sediments or soils or discharge in wetlands is suggested nunes et al 2021 4 conclusions ozonation was able to remove over 80 of the 11 organic micropollutants found above the limit of detection in the secondary treated urban wastewater except for alachlor 75 11 and led to the reduction of total heterotrophs abundance from 105 cfu ml 1 to levels close or below the loq immediately after treatment however this effect was transient and the cells surviving ozonation were able to regrow in both ozonated urban wastewater and pristine mineral water storage of surviving cells in both ozonated urban wastewater and pristine mineral water led to significant bacterial community rearrangements loss of bacterial diversity and selection of organisms affiliated to proteobacteria namely related to acinetobacter and p aeruginosa organisms with high relative abundance in stored water harboured args some of which in the vicinity of mobile genetic elements p aeruginosa harboured args conferring resistance to 12 classes of antibiotics in acinetobacter spp genes encoding carbapenem hydrolysing oxacillinases were detected these results suggest that regrowth of the cells surviving ozonation cannot be only attributed to the presence of assimilable ozonation reaction by products instead it seems to be related to the capacity of the surviving cells to cope with conditions

16891,ozonation is among the currently used technologies to remove chemical and biological contaminants from secondary treated urban wastewater uww despite its effectiveness on the abatement of organic micropollutants omps and disinfection previous studies have shown that regrow of bacteria may occur upon storage of the ozonated uww this reactivation has been attributed to the high content of assimilable organic carbon after treatment in order to investigate if ozonation by products are the main biological regrowth drivers in stored ozonated uww the ozonation surviving cells were resuspended in sterile bottled mineral water mw simulating a pristine oligotrophic environment after 7 days storage organisms such as acinetobacter methylobacterium cupriavidus massilia acidovorax and pseudomonas were dominant in both ozonated uww and pristine mw demonstrating that bacterial regrowth is not strictly related to the eventual presence of ozonation by products but instead with the ability of the surviving cells to cope with nutrient poor environments the resistome of uww before and after ozonation was analysed by metagenomic techniques draft metagenome assembled genomes dmags recovered from both ozonated uww and after cell resuspension in mw harboured genes conferring resistance to diverse antibiotics classes some of these antibiotic resistance genes args were located in the vicinity of mobile genetic elements suggesting their potential to be mobilized among these dmags affiliated to taxa with high relative abundance in stored water such as p aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp harboured args conferring resistance to 12 and 4 families of antibiotics respectively including those encoding carbapenem hydrolysing oxacillinases the results herein obtained point out that the design and development of new wastewater treatment technologies should include measures to attenuate the imbalance of the bacterial communities promoted by storage of the final treated wastewater even when applying processes with high mineralization rates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment ozonation antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes metagenome assembled genome pseudomonas acinetobacter 1 introduction freshwater plays an essential role in the balance of ecosystems and the wellbeing of human populations however the water demand for domestic industry and mainly agriculture use has been increasing worldwide un world water development report 2019 the dramatic growth agglomeration and sophistication of the human population and climate change are the main factors contributing to the increasing water shortages even in countries that have been considered water rich boretti and rosa 2019 hence treated urban wastewater has been seen as an alternative water source european commision 2020 boretti and rosa 2019 eurostat 2018 tortajada 2020 however to be reused treated wastewater must be safe i e it must not put at risk environmental and human health most of the urban wastewater treatment plants uwwtps operating worldwide are designed to efficiently remove readily metabolizable organic matter and pathogens from wastewater tchobanoglous et al 2003 however industrial innovation and development have been changing human lifestyle and consequently the type of pollutants discharged in wastewater consequently the effluents of conventional uwwtps still contain high levels of organic micropollutants omps and potentially harmful bacteria such as antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes arb args indeed it has been estimated that conventional uwwtps operating according to the required quality standards may discharge to the receiving environment daily more than 1010 1012 cells of arb 1010 1018 copies of args and 93 g of 33 different omps manaia et al 2016 mceachran et al 2018 vaz moreira et al 2014 therefore efforts have been made over the years to develop more efficient wastewater treatment options and to identify the key operating parameters to improve the quality of the uwwtp effluents advanced oxidation technologies aots emerging as effective tertiary treatments particularly ozonation is a consolidated aot applied at full scale in uwwtps for disinfection and omps abatement bourgin et al 2018 cui et al 2020 hollender et al 2009 rizzo et al 2019 zimmermann et al 2011 however little attention has been given to the effect of aots on the dynamics of the bacterial communities and the uww resistomes becerra castro et al 2016 garrido cardenas et al 2017 hembach et al 2019 jäger et al 2018 moreira et al 2018 stamps et al 2018 previous studies demonstrated that cells surviving to a given aot are capable of regrowth in stored treated water to levels similar to those found before that treatment becerra castro et al 2016 malvestiti and dantas 2018 moreira et al 2016 2018 narcisoda rocha et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 moreover this regrowth was shown to be accompanied by the potential selection of some bacterial groups and the reduction of bacterial diversity strong predominance of organisms belonging to proteobacteria namely pseudomonas and acinetobacter have been found after treatment with different aots including ozonation and solar driven technologies alexander et al 2016 becerra castro et al 2016 jäger et al 2018 moreira et al 2018 these genera are characterized by harbouring opportunistic pathogens lyczak et al 2000 munoz price and weinstein 2008 moreover some strains of these genera were shown to be resistant against a wide range of the existing antibiotic classes and to have the capacity to acquire new resistance determinants dijkshoorn et al 2007 hwang and yoon 2019 therefore even though the high efficiency of aots on the degradation or even mineralization of the organic matter the predominance of these organisms in stored treated wastewater is undesirable for instance if its reuse in agriculture irrigation is envisaged the risk of transmission of potentially hazardous bacteria to humans due to irrigation with water with poor microbiological quality is of particular importance for vegetables eaten raw becerra castro et al 2015 the lack of residual concentration of disinfectant species together with the generation of oxidation by products have been pointed out as the main factors contributing to the reactivation of injured microorganisms when aots are applied becerra castro et al 2016 papageorgiou et al 2014 for instance carbonyl compounds along with carboxylic acids have been reported to represent about 30 of the ozonation by products richardson 2003 the metabolic versatility of pseudomonas and acinetobacter which have been shown to have the capacity to degrade carbonyl compounds johnson et al 2011 keil et al 1983 razika et al 2010 shao et al 2015 wilkes and aristilde 2017 wu et al 2018 may bring selective advantage of these organisms over others to survive in ozonated uww in this context the present study aimed at investigating if the by products formed during the ozonation of uwwtp effluents are the main drivers of the abovementioned disturbances occurring in stored treated uww given the wide diversity of by products expected to be formed at low concentration during ozonation instead of monitoring their biodegradation the behavior of cells surviving ozonation in a non human impacted environment with low concentration of naturally occurring organic compounds was assessed to achieve this goal the ozonated uww was split into two aliquots one of the aliquots was directly stored for 7 days the second aliquot was filtered and the cells were resuspended in sterile still mineral water mw with values of dissolved organic carbon 5 to 15 times lower than those commonly found in ozonated wastewater e g lesaulnier et al 2017 iakovides et al 2019 in this study mw simulated the effluent of a hypothetical and ideal treatment process capable of transforming wastewater into pristine oligotrophic water in terms of chemical composition reactivation and bacterial community disturbance occurring in the stored samples were compared in addition potential arbs were identified in each sample through the search of args in the recovered draft metagenome assembled genomes dmags to the best of our knowledge this is the first study assessing the capacity of bacteria surviving ozonation to colonize pristine nutrient poor environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the omps reference standards of 98 purity alachlor atrazine bezafibrate

briefly the experimental apparatus consists of a bubble column reactor 3 0 cm internal diameter 70 cm height useful volume of approximately 310 ml packed with glass rings to promote the contact between the gas and liquid phase graça et al 2020a and with a continuous entrance of ww0 at the bottom of the column and a continuous outlet stream wwt0 at the top of this column gas washing bottles filled with potassium iodide solution were used to remove the ozone leaving the reactor in the gas phase the efficiency of the process was estimated after achieving the steady state for a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 min an ozone dose of 10 mg o3 l 1 measured in the liquid phase by the indigo colorimetric method bader and hoigné 1981 was selected to perform ozonation experiments considering a previous optimization study iakovides et al 2019 according to the dissolved organic carbon doc values of ww0 table s1 specific ozone doses varied between 0 5 1 go3 gdoc 1 average value of 0 7 0 2 go3 gdoc 1 which are values commonly found in the literature for the treatment of uww including at full scale borowska et al 2016 bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2016 schollée et al 2018 these specific ozone dose and hrt 10 mg o3 l 1 and 20 min respectively were selected in the present study to mimic real conditions as increasing these values leads to excessive capital and operating costs at the selected conditions it is possible to disinfect the wastewater efficiently but regrowth has been frequently observed iakovides et al 2019 graça et al 2020b after

database release 3 0 9 08 06 20 alcock et al 2020 was used only coding dna sequences cdss showing a strict or perfect match with the arg references of this database were considered the perfect algorithm detects antimicrobial resistance amr proteins with an exact 100 match to a card reference sequence while the strict algorithm is more flexible allowing for variation from the card reference sequence as long as the sequence falls within the curated blast bit score cut offs and is useful for detecting previously unknown variants of amr genes or antibiotic targets altered via mutation alcock et al 2020 the presence of mobile genetic elements namely dna transposable sequences was searched in the mag contigs by manual inspection of the 30 open reading frames upstream and downstream of each identified arg and their corresponding annotations in artemis carver et al 2008 2012 2 8 statistical analysis microbial counts were compared using one way anova and the post hoc tukey test past v4 0 software hammer et al 2001 the permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova based on generalized unifrac distances was performed using past v4 0 hammer et al 2001 to evaluate if the bacterial communities were grouped by sample and if there were statistically different groups within the analysed bacterial communities 2 9 data availability demultiplexed sequences and metadata are available from the sequence read archives sra under accession number prjna665486 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of organic micropollutants among the 14 omps analysed table s1 the pesticides atrazine simazine and methiocarb were below the limit of detection lod in all the three ww0 samples in contrast the pesticide isoproturon 2 1 69 6 ng l 1 and the fluorosurfactant pfos 108 249 ng l 1 were quantified in all the ww0 samples the concentrations of the other analysed omps varied from values below limits of quantification loq up to the highest concentration 9 µg l 1 that was found for the antidepressant citalopram the ozonation treatment led to the removal of omps over 80 except for alachlor 75 11 fig 2 these removal rates are similar to those obtained in several studies applying low ozone concentrations doses bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 iakovides et al 2019 schollée et al 2018 and to the threshold values to comply the requirements of the swiss water protection act which is the only national legislation regulating the concentration of omps in effluents of uwwtps eggen et al 2014 foen 2015 besides the omps herein studied the uww contains a variety of other organic compounds the doc removal was found to vary between 14 and 35 rendering ozonated wastewater with a final doc content of 10 7 2 1 mg l 1 values in line with those reported in the literature for uww after ozonation iakovides et al 2019 3 2 bacterial load removal and reactivation as expected ozonation led to the reduction of the targeted cultivable bacterial groups analysed total heterotrophs and pseudomonads from 105 cfu ml 1 to levels close or below the loq 0 33 10 2 cfu ml 1 immediately after treatment wwt0 fig 3 a b during storage reactivation of the cultivable cells surviving ozonation to levels comparable to those occurring in ww0 was consistently observed in the three wwt7 replicates i e wwt7 1 3 fig 3a b as reported elsewhere moreira et al 2018 2016 sousa et al 2017 when the cells surviving ozonation were transferred into sterile mw cwwt0 mw7 they were also able to regrow to levels similar to those occurring in ww0 in one sampling campaign cwwt0 mw7 1 whereas regrowth was not observed or reached levels lower than those occurring in ww0 in the two other campaigns fig 3a b the quantification of the 16s rrna gene herein used to estimate the abundance of total bacteria per volume of sample corroborated these findings fig 3c 3 3 bacterial community structure and composition to identify the bacterial groups capable of surviving ozonation and eventually regrow upon storage a 16s rrna gene sequence based community analysis was carried out as can be observed in the pcoa biplot storage of ww0 ww7 or storage of cells from ww0 resuspended in sterile mw cww0 mw7 did not significantly change the structure and composition of the bacterial communities fig 4 group i p 0 05 indeed proteobacteria bacteroidetes and candidatus parcubacteria od1 were the major phyla found in ww0 as well as in the non ozonated control samples with average relative abundances varying between 18 36 17 32 and 14 28 respectively fig 5 a in addition all of these samples harboured a wide diversity of genera and families most of them with abundances lower than 2 or 5 respectively fig 5b figure s1 in contrast ozone treatment followed by storage wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 led to significant bacterial community rearrangements and loss of bacterial diversity fig 4 group ii p 0 05 fig 5 in these samples proteobacteria was almost the only phylum detected 98 8 1 8 and 97 1 4 6 in wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 respectively fig 5a moreover these samples were dominated by a few genera between 3 and 8 which constituted 89 99 and 95 99 of the total abundance found in wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 respectively fig 5b the loss of diversity and equability is corroborated by the lower values of the alpha diversity indices of the wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 samples when compared to those found in non ozonated samples table 1 the exact bacterial composition of each of the three analysed samples of wwt7 differed wwt7 1 wwt7 2 and wwt7 3 harboured 20 22 and 69 genera respectively which represent between 2 4 and 8 7 of the total genera found in the corresponding ww0 1 3 samples only acinetobacter and comamonas were found in all the wwt7 samples despite their variable abundance in each sample figure s2 other genera such as pseudomonas brevundimonas methylobacterium rhizobium microbacterium and mycobacterium were found in two out of the three wwt7 samples figure s2 hence most of the genera were detected in only one wwt7 sample from these cupriavidus acidovorax and massilia were among the most abundant figure s2 this variability was also observed in the cwwt0 mw7 samples cwwt0 mw7 1 cwwt0 mw7 2 and cwwt0 mw7 3 harboured 58 45 and 54 genera respectively out of which 52 to 85 were not detected in the correspondent wwt7 samples examples are human gut commensals of genera enterobacter escherichia cwwt0 mw7 1 cwwt0 mw7 3 and faecalibacterium cwwt0 mw7 2 which were found at relative abundances lower than 0 01 data not shown each bacterial community of the cwwt0 mw7 samples was dominated by 4 or 5 different genera figs 5b and s2 among these only acinetobacter methylobacterium cupriavidus and massilia were present at high relative abundance in both cwwt0 mw7 and the correspondent wwt7 sample bradyrhizobium and phenylobacterium were also found in both type of samples but at higher abundance in cwwt0 mw7 than in wwt7 samples other abundant genera included sphingomonas zoogloea deinococcus acidovorax and pseudomonas which except the last two were found in low abundance in non correspondent wwt7 samples figure s2 interestingly a high relative abundance of organisms affiliated to pseudomonas was sporadic detected in contrast with the high abundance of cultivable bacteria grown on pia particularly in the wwt7 samples fig 5a indeed the 16s rrna gene sequence based analysis of the dna extracted from the biomass grown on this selective medium revealed that pia was able to recover a wide diversity of bacteria besides pseudomonadaceae examples are enterobacteriaceae bacillaceae and brucellaceae which despite their low abundance in the 16s rrna libraries directly recovered from the wastewater samples figure s1 showed high abundance in the correspondent libraries recovered from the biomass grown on pia figure s3a in addition pia was also able to recover the abundant organisms retrieved from the correspondent wastewater 16s rrna libraries such as aeromonas in the non ozonated samples and acinetobacter acidovorax and cupriavidus in the ozonated samples figure s3b although knowing that selective media may recover organisms present at very low abundance in the community vaz moreira et al 2011 these results indicate that pia was not able to selectively recover the initially targeted bacterial group 3 4 identification of bacteria harbouring args the reactivation of args conferring resistance to different classes of antibiotics in stored ozonated wastewater was reported before becerra castro et al 2016 iakovides et al 2019 sousa et al 2017 however these studies did not evaluate which organisms were carrying the quantified args to overcome this difficulty in the present study a shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach followed by binning was carried out to recover the mags present in each type of analysed samples this procedure allowed to recover the dmags of the minority 0 8 8 4 of the otus present in the respective pooled samples mainly from those with high diversity and richness ww0 ww7 and cww0 mw7 tables 1 s3 and s4 moreover possibly because of the high abundance of closely related organisms present in the samples none of the recovered dmags fulfilled the criteria proposed for high quality mags bowers et al 2017 nevertheless excepting one no 19 of pool cww0 mw7 table s4 the 98 recovered dmags showed completeness higher than 70 1 and contamination lower than 8 3 table s4 being thus considered of medium quality bowers et al 2017 the difficulties in the binning of the metagenome data from samples with high richness and diversity could also be noticed when analysing the identification of each recovered dmag approximately 71 of the 17 and 38 dmags retrieved from the ww0 and ww7 pools respectively could be identified at the order or higher taxonomic ranks only whereas 75 and 56 of the 8 and 9 dmags recovered from the wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 pools respectively could be identified at the genus or species level figure s4 in order to estimate the abundance of each dmag in each analysed pool the same taxon or the taxon of the immediate above rank was searched for in the corresponding 16s rrna gene sequence libraries table s4 as reported before it was possible to conclude that the binning of the metagenome data could assemble the genomes of organisms present in a wide range of abundances bowers et al 2017 even in the pool of samples with the highest diversity indices ww0 indeed it was possible to assemble dmags of organisms affiliated to taxa such as arcobacter and spirochaetia for which abundances reaching 14 or not exceeding 0 4 in the ww0 1 3 samples were respectively obtained table s4 moreover for 6 out of the 13 genera with abundances higher than 2 in the 16s rrna gene sequence libraries of the wwt7 1 3 samples it was possible to retrieve a dmag identified at the same taxonomic or even lower rank pseudomonas aeruginosa figures s2 and s5 table s4 the two other dmags recovered from this pool were only identified at the family level comamonadaceae and oxalobacteraceae these families respectively include comamonas and massilia which were found in the wwt7 1 3 samples at high abundance figure s2 table s4 from the cwwt0 mw7 1 3 pool dmags affiliated to 5 out of the 11 genera with abundances higher than 2 in the 16s rrna gene sequence libraries were retrieved figure s2 table s4 from these samples dmags identified at the family or order to which massilia sphingomonas and zoogloea belong were also respectively recovered figure s2 table s4 in addition a dmag identified as belonging to alicycliphilus a member of comamonadaceae one of the abundant families recovered from cwwt0 mw7 1 figure s1 was also obtained table s4 among the dmags recovered from all the analysed pools only a minority 4 to 25 harboured cdss with a strict or perfect match with reference args of the card database table 2 some of these args were located nearby mobile genetic elements such as integrases and transposases table 2 suggesting the potential of these args to be mobilized genes conferring resistance to last generation beta lactams were found in aeromonas which constituted 2 of the total abundance in ww0 indeed extended spectrum beta lactamases and carbapenemases have been detected in both aeromonas clinical and environmental isolates bogaerts et al 2017 piotrowska et al 2017 these traits have been crucial to consider these ubiquitous bacteria as potential vectors of antibiotic resistance piotrowska et al 2017 varela and manaia 2013 despite the capacity of ozonation to reduce the abundance of aeromonas fig 5b the ozonated wastewater harboured other arg carriers in wwt7 as expected p aeruginosa which constituted up to 13 of the total abundance in wwt7 3 figure s5 harboured args conferring resistance to 12 families of antibiotics most of the args found in the p aeruginosa dmag encode efflux pumps conferring multi resistance although others conferring inactivation of different antimicrobials were also detected table 2 indeed p aeruginosa is described as able to intrinsically express numerous efflux pumps conferring resistance to multiple antibiotics and disinfectants pang et al 2019 along with a wide diversity of transferases able to inactive antibiotics such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones pang et al 2019 moreover p aeruginosa is also known to encode chromosomic oxa carbapanemases and inducible cephalosporinases barnes et al 2018 walther rasmussen and høiby 2006 the ozonation treatment also selected for acinetobacter figs 5b s2 as expected the dmags related to this genus recovered from both wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 also harboured genes encoding carbapenem hydrolysing oxacillinases indeed the bla oxa 211 gene has been naturally found in a johnsonii figueiredo et al 2012 which constituted up to 11 of the total abundance found in cwwt0 mw7 1 also the bla oxa 275 gene which encodes a cephalosporinase has been detected in a guillouiae périchon et al 2014 one of the acinetobacter species found in the wwt7 pool at abundances reaching 26 table 2 figure s5 from the 17 arg gene families detected only four arg from the antibiotic resistant rpsl antibiotic resistant mura transferase rbpa bacterial rna polymerase binding protein and sulfonamide resistant sul showed higher prevalence in ww0 or in the non treated controls ww7 cww0 mw7 2 6 to 5 9 than in the ozonated samples wwt7 cwwt0 mw7 where no gene of these families was found table s5 in contrast 9 out of the 17 arg gene families were not detected in ww0 or in the non treated controls among the 13 gene families detected in the treated samples aph 3 ii and beta lactamase contained args with highest prevalence in cwwt0 mw7 11 1 and 55 5 respectively whereas the args of the remaining 11 families were more prevalent in wwt7 with relative abundances ranging from 12 5 to more than 100 for the resistance nodulation cell division antibiotic efflux pump family table s5 3 5 potential risks related to storage of ozonated uww the overall analysis of the results herein obtained suggests that the oxidative stress promoted by the ozonation treatment acts stochastically upon the wastewater microbiota leading to a transitory decrease of the bacterial load as reported before alexander et al 2016 becerra castro et al 2016 cui et al 2020 jäger et al 2018 disinfection processes may render surviving cells to a viable but non cultivable state which reverts when the stress status is relieved leading to bacterial reactivation amarasiri et al 2019 however the low content of total dna in wwt0 suggests that other mechanisms may underpin the observed regrowth upon storage of the treated wastewater the occurrence of microbial regrowth after treatment by aots has been attributed to the capacity of surviving cells to use any available carbon and energy sources such as non oxidized organic matter and reaction by products thayanukul et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 in fact the implementation of a subsequent adsorption treatment step has been recommended to minimize the release of compounds generated during ozonation rizzo et al 2020 in this study to assess the contribution of the organic matter in the effluent treated by ozonation including reaction by products on the capacity of surviving cells to regrow upon storage the cells surviving ozonation were simultaneously stored in the ozonated wastewater and in sterile mineral water in the first environment the surviving cells could tolerate or eventually use non degraded organic matter of the original uww and or ozone by products in contrast the sterile mineral water by one hand was free of any micropollutant or oxidation by product and by the another hand contained naturally occurring organic matter at a concentration approximately 10 fold lower than that of the ozonated wastewater wwt0 supplementary tables 1 and 2 hence it simulated a pristine oligotrophic environment as those hypothetically achieved if ozonation or any other water treatment technology could transform secondary treated wastewater into spring water the levels of total and cultivable bacteria restored upon storage in both ozonated wastewater wwt7 and mineral water cwwt0 mw7 indicating that bacterial reactivation cannot be directly attributed to the presence of assimilable ozonation reaction by products instead it seems to be related to the capacity of the surviving cells to cope with conditions prevailing in nutrient poor environments indeed the non ozonated ww0 cells were also able to survive upon storage in sterile mw fig 3 cww0 mw7 these results are in line with those observed upon bottling of still mineral water the so called bottle effect leclerc and moreau 2002 lesaulnier et al 2017 the capacity of total bacteria colonizing the source water aquifer 103 cells ml 1 to grow up to 105 106 cells ml 1 within few days after bottling is well known e g leclerc and moreau 2002 egli 2010 lesaulnier et al 2017 however the mechanisms underpinning such capacity are still poorly understood leclerc and moreau 2002 lesaulnier et al 2017 nevertheless experimental evidence suggested that carbon concentration in the range of 1 to 100 µg l 1 is sufficient to enable bacterial growth and it is estimated that only 0 5 to 5 of the 0 5 5 mg l 1 total dissolved organic matter available in oligotrophic waters such as underground drinking and surface waters is sufficient to attain microbial loads of 104 106 cells ml 1 as those typically found in these environments eli 2010 lesaulnier et al 2017 indeed the estimated assimilable organic carbon of cww0 mw7 1 sample where regrowth of total heterotrophs was most notorious fig 3 was 1 55 µgc l 1 a value close to the average calculated for the wwt7 samples 1 66 µgc l 1 supplementary table s6 which corresponded to 0 13 and 0 01 of the total dissolved organic matter of mw and wwt7 respectively the bottleneck promoted by ozonation also led to the decrease of the bacterial diversity of the stored water to very low levels independent of the exact chemical composition of the water in contrast to the microbial load richness and diversity kept low even after 7 days as reported before alexander et al 2016 becerra castro et al 2016 cui et al 2020 jäger et al 2018 interestingly similar findings were reported by lesaulnier et al 2017 who observed loss of diversity and the dominance of only 1 to 15 otus affiliated to betaproteobacteria among the rich bacterial community of non carbonated mineral water after bottling although also confirming proteobacteria as the phylum harbouring bacteria able to survive ozonation and regrow upon storage becerra castro et al 2016 the results obtained demonstrated that most of the organisms surviving ozonation and storage differed according to the sampling and treatment day which suggests some degree of stochasticity these changes might be related to the original composition of the raw secondary wastewater ww0 the degree of susceptibility of the surviving cells to the stress factors imposed by ozonation and or the ability of some cell lineages to outcompete the remaining surviving microorganisms under the prevailing conditions despite this stochasticity survivors of ozonation capable of reaching high abundance in the presence of reaction products included organisms belonging to acidovorax acinetobacter brevundimonas comamonas cupriavidus methylobacterium massilia and pseudomonas such results suggest that these organisms through improved mechanisms to cope with nutrient poor environments had a competitive advantage and become predominant indeed these bacteria are described to inhabit oligotrophic environments such as drinking water bruno et al 2018 donofrio et al 2010 gallego et al 2006 narcisoda rocha et al 2013 rice et al 2000 van assche et al 2019 vaz moreira et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 the capacity to tolerate disinfectants in organisms of the genera methylobacterium and cupriavidus kovaleva et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 or to form protecting structures such as biofilms in pseudomonas and methylobacterium kovaleva et al 2014 vaz moreira et al 2012 have been pointed out as traits favouring their ability to cope with the conditions prevailing in disinfected water such as in drinking water distribution systems organisms of some of the most abundant genera found in wwt7 are also described as capable of mineral water colonization e g acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas spp including pseudomonas aeruginosa bartram et al 2003 leclerc and moreau 2002 hence it is not surprising to find high abundance of these organisms in still mineral water cwwt0 mw7 as well to survive or even regrow in nutrient poor environments such as stored ozonated wastewater or sterile mineral water the organisms of these genera may have one or more mechanisms to cope with the reduced amount of energy and carbon sources previous studies carried out in oligotrophic environments have shown that cells may adopt different strategies to overcome the lack of nutrients one strategy is to enter a starvation physiological survival state which allows the cells to survive but hampers reproduction or induce very low growth rates gray et al 2019 leclerc and moreau 2002 the cells under starvation are usually smaller in order to increase the surface volume ratio and thus sequester nutrients more efficiently leclerc and moreau 2002 some of these bacteria may enter a viable but non culturable state leclerc and moreau 2002 li et al 2014 which may eventually be restored in the presence of nutrients such as when herein plated on pia nutritive media e g brucellaceae enterobacteriaceae figure s3 or transferred into another environmental compartment e g surface water bulk or rhizosphere soil organisms capable of accumulating reserve polymers may also surpass the lack of nutrients with those able to use the reserve macromolecules at a slow rate showing an advantage over other bacteria leclerc and moreau 2002 hence the ability to accumulate poly β hydroxybutyrate and polyphosphate achbergerová and nahálka 2011 mozejko ciesielska et al 2019 schembri et al 1994 zago et al 1999 may have favoured the survival and regrowth of acinetobacter spp and p aeruginosa in both wwt7 and cwwt0 mw7 samples other mechanisms of survival and regrowth in highly competitive nutrient poor environments are related to the ability of some bacteria to produce transport systems with increased affinities for nutrients or to the capacity to express transport and metabolic systems for a wide diversity of alternative nutrients eli 2010 leclerc and moreau 2002 lesaulnier et al 2017 mahnert et al 2019 ozonation of some recalcitrant organic pollutants can render more readily metabolizable nutrients van leeuwen et al 2009 hence versatile metabolic organisms such as those belonging to genera acidovorax acinetobacter cupriavidus massilia methylobacterium and pseudomonas would benefit from the presence of ozone by products in wwt7 becoming dominant in the ozonated wastewater bacterial community in addition the ability of these organisms to live in pristine oligotrophic environments allowed their development in still mineral water cwwt0 mw7 as well in contrast organisms belonging to bradyrhizobium phenylobacterium sphingomonas zoogloea and deinococcus although surviving ozonation seem to recover when transferred into pristine environments cwwt0 mw7 interestingly bacteria subjected to nutrients limitation may become tolerant to stressful conditions namely to antibiotics and oxidative stress fung et al 2010 gray et al 2019 leclerc and moreau 2002 mahnert et al 2019 in this study we demonstrated that among the organisms surviving ozonation and becoming dominant in stored ozonated wastewater are those related to the ubiquitous opportunistic pathogens acinetobacter spp and p aeruginosa diggle and whiteley 2020 périchon et al 2014 indeed p aeruginosa and a baumannii have been described to be less affected by ozonation and to persist after treatment alexander et al 2016 hembach et al 2019 in addition we demonstrated that these organisms harbor intrinsic resistance to different classes of antibiotics namely to last generation beta lactams consequently high prevalence of acinetobacter spp and p aeruginosa is undesirable in stored treated wastewater mainly if its reuse in the irrigation of eaten raw vegetables is envisaged given the inability of the binning and assembling methods herein used to recover most of the shotgun metagenomic data obtained tables s3 and s4 most probably the surviving organisms harboured a much richer resistome than that retrieved from the dmags particularly the difficulties in the assemblage binning of plasmids chen et al 2020 hampered the identification of args potentially involved in horizontal gene transference nevertheless organisms of both genera pseudomonas partridge et al 2018 and acinetobacter salto et al 2018 are known to carry plasmids eventually harbouring args hence further plasmidomic studies are necessary to identify the risk of reusing stored ozonated wastewater in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance determinants through conjugation the results of the present study point out the necessity to rethink wastewater treatment targets towards a more enlightened design and implementation of advanced full scale processes i e that may attenuate the imbalance of the bacterial communities in treated wastewater this is particularly relevant when treated wastewater is stored for reuse in irrigation of crops and where the overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria should be avoided applying treatments with high mineralization rates may not be a solution as herein demonstrated alternatively restoring the phylogenetic and functional microbial diversity of the treated wastewater through mixing with pristine surface water sediments or soils or discharge in wetlands is suggested nunes et al 2021 4 conclusions ozonation was able to remove over 80 of the 11 organic micropollutants found above the limit of detection in the secondary treated urban wastewater except for alachlor 75 11 and led to the reduction of total heterotrophs abundance from 105 cfu ml 1 to levels close or below the loq immediately after treatment however this effect was transient and the cells surviving ozonation were able to regrow in both ozonated urban wastewater and pristine mineral water storage of surviving cells in both ozonated urban wastewater and pristine mineral water led to significant bacterial community rearrangements loss of bacterial diversity and selection of organisms affiliated to proteobacteria namely related to acinetobacter and p aeruginosa organisms with high relative abundance in stored water harboured args some of which in the vicinity of mobile genetic elements p aeruginosa harboured args conferring resistance to 12 classes of antibiotics in acinetobacter spp genes encoding carbapenem hydrolysing oxacillinases were detected these results suggest that regrowth of the cells surviving ozonation cannot be only attributed to the presence of assimilable ozonation reaction by products instead it seems to be related to the capacity of the surviving cells to cope with conditions

16892,investigation of seasonal variations of water quality parameters is essential for understanding the mechanisms of structural changes in aquatic ecosystems and their pollution control despite the ongoing rise in scientific production on spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of water quality parameters such as total nitrogen tn in reservoirs attempts to use published data and incorporate them into a large scale comparison and trends analyses are lacking here we propose a framework of data extraction data grouping and statistical analysis dds and illustrate application of this dds framework with the example of tn in reservoirs among 1722 publications related to tn in reservoirs 58 tn time series data from 19 reservoirs met the analysis requirements and were extracted using the dds framework we performed statistical analysis on these time series data using dynamic time warping dtw combined with agglomerative hierarchical clustering as well as generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss three patterns of seasonal tn dynamics were identified in pattern v sum tn concentrations change in a v shape dropping to its lowest value in summer in pattern p sum tn increases in late summer early fall before decreasing again and in pattern p spr tn peaks in spring identified patterns were driven by phytoplankton growth and precipitation pattern v sum nitrate wet deposition and agricultural runoff pattern p sum and anthropogenic discharges pattern p spr application of the dds framework has identified a key bottleneck in assessing the dynamics of tn low data accessibility and availability providing an easily accessible data sharing platform and increasing the accessibility and availability of raw data for research will facilitate improvements and expand the applicability of the dds framework identification of additional spatiotemporal patterns of water quality parameters can provide new insights for more comprehensive pollution control and management of aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reservoir total nitrogen seasonal dynamics data mining 1 introduction reservoirs are artificial freshwater ecosystems built to meet basic water needs for human activities purposes of reservoirs include water security to support fundamental human requirements such as drinking water food energy as well as human health and general well being although water surface area of reservoirs accounts for only 6 of the global lentic waters they trap 33 of the total nitrogen tn removed from terrestrial ecosystems by lentic systems nitrogen burial and denitrification harrison et al 2009 and serve as important nitrogen storage sites in reservoir ecosystems nitrogen plays a key role in sustaining primary production and biogeochemical cycles and its cellular demand is higher than that of nutrients such as phosphorus and iron andersen et al 2020 hecky and kilham 1988 nevertheless negative impacts of excessive nitrogen due to anthropogenic exogenous and endogenous loadings e g agricultural fertilization soil erosion atmospheric deposition and decompositions of plants and algae on reservoir ecosystems and human health galloway et al 2004 have been well documented for instance surplus nutrient loading can lead to non nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria becoming superior competitors huisman et al 2018 and resulting cyanobacterial blooms not only deteriorate water quality but also release algal toxins that harm ecological health gaget et al 2017 water quality problems in reservoirs caused by eutrophication and harmful algal blooms have been of great concern and present a global challenge huang et al 2020 understanding patterns of seasonal tn dynamics in reservoirs is often a prerequisite for reversing current water quality problems and managing reservoir ecosystems over the past decades researchers have focused on how to alleviate the above mentioned negative effects caused by reservoir excess nitrogen and sustainably maintain reservoir ecosystem services examples include investigating trophic state and seasonal changes in south korean reservoirs jones et al 2003 assessing reservoir trophic status and impact on phytoplankton xu et al 2010 and examining spatiotemporal distribution variability of nutrients during a wet and dry year williamson et al 2020 these studies used different data processing and statistical methods to investigate distribution characteristics of water quality parameters at local scales and paradigms cannot be generalized and applied to other reservoirs to our knowledge no studies have attempted to analyze reservoir tn dynamics on a global scale and incorporated environmental factors such as climate and hydrology this is partly due to weak optical activity of reservoir tn which has spatiotemporal variation and the limited ability to monitor and predict its dynamics by satellite remote sensing vakili and amanollahi 2020 fortunately availability of tn monitoring data for water quality in existing publications offers the potential to meet large scale trend studies in tn dynamics how to mine existing data from the literature and analyze them scientifically and statistically is key to study dynamics of water quality parameters most studies that focus on dynamics of environmental parameters over time have collected multi scale datasets with spatiotemporal variability thus selection of appropriate grouping and fitting methods is beneficial for the interpretation of time series data and pattern recognition li et al 2021 time series clustering methods are powerful tools for analyzing patterns of seasonal dynamics and identifying overall spatiotemporal characteristics of parameters among many time series similarities measures dynamic time warping dtw currently consists of the most widely applied and effective algorithms and is most effective at finding the best alignment and measuring distances dupas et al 2016 lottig et al 2017 wang et al 2020 undoubtedly it is feasible to use dtw to measure distances and differences between time series data furthermore generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss was used to fit the seasonal dynamics this model is widely employed in hydrological time series modeling as a flexible statistical modeling approach li and tan 2015 lópez and francés 2013 su and chen 2019 here we proposed a framework of data extraction data grouping and statistical analysis dds framework aimed at assessing dynamic variations of water quality parameters taking tn in reservoirs as an example the framework is applied to extract and statistically analyze literature data to explore the following research questions 1 how can time series data be most efficiently collected from the existing literature 2 what are the patterns of tn seasonal dynamics in reservoirs 3 what are the causes of tn dynamics application of the dds framework for tn dynamic exploration contributes to the eutrophication control and management of reservoir ecosystems meanwhile key issues in the data mining and dynamic exploration of water quality parameters with tn as an example were demonstrated and the significance of current data sharing and improving the accessibility and availability of raw data to promote pollution management in aquatic ecosystems is emphasized 2 methods the dds framework shown in fig 1 demonstrates whole process of extracting grouping and statistically analyzing the time series data taking reservoir tn as an example first retrieved literatures are screened and time series data are extracted then obtained time series data are sorted and grouped finally time series clustering and fitting are performed on the data sets that met analytical requirements to obtain tn patterns combined with other environmental factors the causes of seasonal variations of tn were identified 2 1 data extraction first a search was performed in web of science core collection for literature published from 1990 to 2020 using the terms reservoir and nutrient and nitrogen in the web of science topic search fig 1a the scope of topic search includes the title abstract and keywords list of the publication a total of 1722 documents were retrieved among the retrieved documents 1351 were available for download as pdf files then we reviewed the full texts of these 1351 documents and found 909 that contained surface water data from the reservoirs further manual screening identified 113 documents containing tn dynamics data and the remaining documents that did not provide tn data or only measured other forms of nitrogen data were excluded these data were presented in 21 tables and 97 figures within the 113 documents we obtained those data either directly from tables or using the getdata graph digitizer software v2 26 http www getdata graph digitizer com from figures some studies performed multi point or stratified sampling i e multiple time series could be obtained in these studies thus a total of 172 time series were obtained 2 2 data grouping the 172 extracted time series data were classified into annual seasonal monthly weekly and daily sampling frequencies fig 1b analyses of tn concentrations on a quarterly or annual monitoring frequency mask seasonal dynamics of reservoir ecosystem structure and other environmental factors kong et al 2019 and these data were not considered daily and weekly scale data were excluded from this study due to absence of 12 period monitoring or missing data or the fact that data were averaged moreover monthly time scale accounted for more than 68 117 of tn time series and thus we focused our analyses on those data tn data were then classified as to whether they were based on averaged or non averaged data we discarded the 35 time series that only provided averaged monthly data the remaining 82 data that provided non averaged data were subdivided into three categories based on the duration of their monitoring time series with a monitoring duration shorter than 12 months 24 time series were excluded from this study as they did not provide a complete annual picture of tn dynamics to facilitate analyses of monthly time series of different durations this study cut data series that had monitoring data between 12 and 24 months 37 time series to a consistent 12 month time span time series that exceeded 24 months were split into 21 sub series with 12 months duration each the 58 time series were further classified according to their spatial data collecting protocol single point multipoint layered and multipoint layered sampling of various water depths sampling overall we analyzed 58 time series from 19 different reservoirs table s1 we retrieved a single time series from eleven reservoirs for eight reservoirs we were able to extract between 2 to 12 time series data data sets that stemmed from the same reservoir were either collected at different times locations or water depths processing of the above time series is based on our assumption that tn dynamics from the same reservoir may also vary depending on sampling time location and water depths see section 3 2 for a detailed discussion usage of averaged data could have made the true trends of tn patterns invisible during our analyses 2 3 statistical analysis the time series data were standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 before analyses fig 1c an agglomerative hierarchical cluster was performed to group tn time series using ward s minimum variance algorithm with dynamic time warping dtw dtw algorithm was used to measure distances between clusters with the smallest sum of squared deviations and is calculated based on the minimum distance of all possible alignments sakoe and chiba 1978 we used the dtw package in the r software for time series cluster analysis once clusters were identified generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss with cubic spline regression was applied to fit patterns of tn seasonal dynamics of all time series in each cluster as a semiparametric or parametric regression model gamlss relaxes the assumptions about the type of distribution of the response variables and can describe any linear or non linear relationship between the variables rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 best fitting distribution was selected based on values of the akaike information criterion aic during gamlss fitting the gamlss package in the r software was used to run gamlss models to investigate the causes of tn dynamics we also collected data on basic information water quality indicators climatic parameters runoff depth and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from the literature and related data sharing platforms table s1 parameter data among them the following data were collected from the literature containing tn dynamic data sampling dates latitude and longitude of sampling sites monthly concentrations data of total phosphorus nitrate n ammonia n and chlorophyll a chl a the extraction and pre processing method of water quality parameters data are consistent with that of tn time series data not all literature contains the above data but at least sampling dates information is required precipitation air temperature mixing depth water temperature and runoff depth were obtained from the climate data store ndvi data were downloaded from the nasa earth observation website to reduce the uncertainty of analysis data obtained from the database were selected for periods corresponding to the tn sampling dates the specific sources and information of each parameter were detailed in table s1 parameter information spearman correlation analyses were performed on monthly datasets of climatic parameters water quality indicators runoff depths and ndvi we used the openair package in the r software to run correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 geographical coverage of total nitrogen tn time series dataset the 58 monthly tn time series data used for analyses originated from 19 reservoirs on five continents fig 2 with broad geographical coverage but were located mainly in asia 10 reservoirs and europe 5 reservoirs the remaining time series were extracted from belle mina reservoir and lake waco reservoir usa pao cachinche reservoir venezuela and yaacoub al mansour reservoir morocco detailed information on the location of the reservoirs can be found in supplementary materials table s1 reservoir information 3 2 spatiotemporal characterization of tn dynamics tn time series data were divided into three clusters fig 3 twenty two tn time series from nine reservoirs on five continents formed cluster 1 tn concentrations in this cluster ranged from 0 03 to 9 12 mg l 1 with an average of 1 44 1 31 mg l 1 the coefficient of variation reached 90 62 and the degree of data dispersion was high the average upper and lower quartiles and the peak of probability density function distribution for cluster 1 were all lower than for cluster 2 and 3 the 16 tn timer series in cluster 2 were from eight reservoirs on four continents with tn ranging from 0 37 to 5 42 mg l 1 and an average of 1 92 1 01 mg l 1 the coefficient of variation was 52 61 and the degree of data dispersion was relatively small for cluster 3 the 20 tn time series came from nine reservoirs on four continents tn concentrations in this cluster ranged from 0 20 to 13 76 mg l 1 with an average of 2 59 2 16 mg l 1 and a coefficient of variation of 83 33 in contrast the average and upper quartile values for cluster 3 were higher than those for cluster 2 tn time series from multiple sampling sites within an individual reservoir were not all spatially similar in their tn dynamics and tn sub time series from same sampling sites over multiple years were not all temporally similar for example while the six time series data collected from different sampling locations of three gorge reservoir all fell into cluster 2 the data from five different sampling locations from qingcaosha reservoir were separated into clusters 1 and 2 and the four time series data stemming from different water surface sampling sites of pao cachinche reservoir ended up in clusters 2 and 3 similarly data sets from different water layers depths could cluster together pao cachinche reservoir or separate shingu reservoir simajigawa reservoir and data sets retrieved from the same reservoir but during different years could end up in the same baihua reservoir lake glebokie reservoir simajihawa reservoir surface layer or different clusters belle mina reservoir simajihawa reservoir middle and bottom layers three patterns of seasonal tn dynamics were identified by fitting the time series in each cluster using the cubic spline function of the gamlss model pattern summer valley v sum fit a power exponential pattern summer peak p sum an ex gaussian and pattern spring peak p spr a skew normal type 2 distribution filliben correlation coefficients were greater than 0 98 for all models and the quality of fit met analytical requirements in all cases the lowest tn concentration for pattern v sum is reached during the summer resulting in a v shape fig 4 a in pattern p sum tn concentration increased in spring peaked in summer and then decreased again reaching its lowest values during the winter months fig 4b in pattern p spr tn increased early in the year and reached a peak in spring and decreased during the summer and fall fig 4c 3 3 correlation between tn and other environmental factors to investigate the causes of tn seasonal dynamics spearman correlations between climate parameters water quality indicators monthly runoff depths and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were analyzed in pattern v sum there were significant and strong positive correlations between tn and tp as well as tn and nitrate n r 0 59 and 0 75 respectively p 0 01 and negative correlations between tn and precipitation tn and ndvi as well as tn and mixing depth r 0 21 0 27 and 0 43 respectively p 0 01 fig 5 a in pattern p sum there were weak positive correlations between tn and tp r 0 25 tn and monthly runoff depth r 0 21 and a negative correlation between tn and mixing depth r 0 45 fig 5b in pattern p spr tn was correlated with nitrate n r 0 78 tp r 0 64 and chl a r 0 52 p 0 01 in all cases fig 5c like the two previous patterns mixing depth was again negatively correlated with tn r 0 88 in pattern p spr additionally all three patterns showed strong negative correlations between tp and tn tp mass ration r 0 74 r 0 88 and r 0 78 respectively p 0 01 in all cases in all three patterns the three parameters tn and air temperature as well as water temperature clustered in the same cluster but did not show significant correlations 4 discussions 4 1 pattern v sum and its potential causes phytoplankton communities play an important role in tn dynamics in pattern v sum fig 4d the negative correlation between tn and ndvi further confirmed that phytoplankton growth likely influenced tn concentration during the growth period phytoplankton take up more nutrients thus reducing their concentration and resulting in the lowest tn concentrations during the summer yang et al 2020 nitrate n concentrations showed similar trends to tn fig s1b and were negatively correlated with water temperature this could be the result of increased water temperature reduced reservoir load and enhanced phytoplankton uptake and denitrification during summer months wang 2020 phytoplankton accelerates the deposition of nutrients and prevents their resuspension of nutrients from the sediment contributing to stabilization of the water column and further reducing nutrient concentrations qi et al 2019 the low temperature winter conditions in the reservoir inhibit aquatic biological activity and lead to low oxygen consumption which decreases the absorption adsorption and deposition of nutrients as a result tn content was higher in both fall and winter compared to summer tn dynamics of pattern v sum were also related to monthly precipitation precipitation patterns are the potential factor in changing the dynamics of water quality parameters atique and an 2020 the negative correlation between tn and monthly precipitation indicates that precipitation affected seasonal variations in tn summer dominated precipitation especially in june caused a significant decrease in tn concentrations due to dilution effects fig s1i furthermore large amounts of runoff that converge after heavy precipitation promote reservoir mixing increase dissolved oxygen levels in the water body and inhibit release of nutrients from the sediment resulting in lower algal biomass in the reservoir li et al 2015 chl a concentrations and chl a tn ratios showed a decreasing trend in summer and we speculate that dilution effect of tn and algae caused by heavy precipitation was stronger during this period tp dynamics in spring and summer were synchronous with tn and there was a moderate negative correlation between tp and precipitation this is consistent with the hypothesis that precipitations have a diluting impact on nutrients dupas et al 2018 tn tp chl a tn and chl a tp ratios are often used as indicators of potential nutrient limitation in reservoirs spears et al 2013 compared to the other two patterns chl a tp ratios were relatively high in pattern v sum and more than 60 of tn tp ratios were greater than 22 6 indicating phosphorus acts as a potentially limiting factor mamun et al 2020 qin et al 2020 chl a tn ratios increased and then decreased in the first half of the year probably due to dilution of tn resulting in transient nitrogen limitation of algae the time series samples in pattern v sum were mainly from drinking water reservoirs such as qingcaosha reservoir and shimajigawa reservoir where the nutrient loads mainly stemmed from natural origin chen and zhu 2018 komatsu et al 2006 in short tn dynamics in pattern v sum were primarily influenced by phytoplankton activity and precipitation and were subject to relatively little human perturbation and had a more healthy natural catchment area 4 2 pattern p sum and its potential causes nitrate wet deposition and agricultural runoff were the factors that dominated tn dynamics in pattern p sum fig 4e a comparison of nitrate n concentrations with corresponding precipitation distribution showed a relationship between nitrate n and precipitation peaking at the same time in summer june fig s1b and i nitrate wet deposition may be the cause of increased nitrogen load in summer because atmospheric nitrogen may have been transformed to nitrate n by nitrification and reached reservoir areas in the form of precipitation hao et al 2017 however tn was not strongly correlated with nitrate and ammonia n and its concentration did not increase to its peak until late summer this may have been caused by surface runoff accumulating after the precipitation period and carrying large amounts of nutrient rich pollutants into the water wang et al 2018 this hypothesis is supported by the positive correlation between tn and monthly runoff depth the sum of surface runoff and sub surface runoff precipitation induced soil erosion can cause an increase in tp and tn loads of water leigh et al 2010 but while tp and runoff depth were negatively correlated neither one exhibited a strong correlation with tn this indicates that tn was not primarily derived from soil erosion additionally nitrate n is closely related to leaching of agricultural nitrogen fertilizers ferrier et al 2001 following heavy precipitation events in summer nitrate n concentrations in pattern p sum were higher than those in the other two patterns and the high proportion of nitrate n compared to ammonia n this probably demonstrates that agricultural runoff has a greater influence on tn dynamics compared to urban inputs al taani 2011 chl a and tn reached the highest values during the same season indicating that stored nutrients and warmer temperatures tend to trigger algal blooms in the summer a decreasing trend in tn concentrations began in the fall which was associated with a decrease in agricultural runoff 4 3 pattern p spr and its potential causes tn dynamics in pattern p spr were mainly attributed to anthropogenic discharges fig 4f a majority of time series samples for this pattern were taken from pao cachinche reservoir and glebokie lake which receive untreated wastewaters from human and animal resulting in eutrophic hypertrophic state gonzalez et al 2004 miller et al 2016 tn tp ratios of pattern p spr were relatively low compared to the other patterns fig s1g reservoirs that are more subjected to agricultural and urban runoff tended to have lower tn tp ratios compared to reservoirs that are exposed to fewer human disturbances mamun et al 2020 in the tn composition the average proportion of inorganic nitrogen reached more than 57 and the proportion of nitrate n and ammonia n was equal which may be attributed to sewage discharge grabb et al 2021 vilmin et al 2018b positive correlations between tn and nitrate n r 0 78 as well as tn and ammonia n r 0 23 further indicated that anthropogenic activities such as agricultural industrial and domestic sewage were the main sources of nitrogen contamination guo et al 2020 agricultural wastewater discharges are most likely to contribute to tn dynamics in pattern p spr activities such as tillage and irrigation are particularly frequent in spring this is accompanied by the discharge of agricultural wastewater rich in nutrients resulting in abnormally high levels of tn during this period zhang et al 2020 as crops are harvested and agricultural activities decrease tn concentrations decrease most of the time series samples in this pattern were located at shallower depth locations such as those at globokie lake and marcali reservoir where the water depth was less than 2 5 m matyas et al 2003 miller et al 2016 thus external anthropogenic disturbances had a greater impact on their water chemistry pattern p spr exhibited higher levels of chl a and tn concentrations compared to the other two patterns fig s1f this is attributed to the fact that reservoirs located in agricultural and urban areas receive relatively more nutrients atique and an 2020 in pattern p spr the increased spring temperature in spring has potential to stimulate phytoplankton growth i e excessive nutrient accumulation is likely to trigger algal blooms in spring liang et al 2020 chl a increased substantially in spring probably because excess nutrient storage tended to trigger algal blooms during that time most of the tn especially in patterns p sum and p spr were greater than 1 mg l 1 demonstrating that most reservoirs are nitrogen rich waters the correlation between chl a and tp was stronger compared to chl a and tn this suggests that tp had more influence on changes of aquatic biomass in nitrogen rich waters which is consistent with the results of other lakes and reservoirs studies søndergaard et al 2017 wang 2020 4 4 challenge of pattern analysis and significance of data availability and sharing we identified tn dynamics in reservoirs but due to limited data there may still be other patterns that were not detected in this study we did not use the tn data from two ice covered reservoirs on one hand because of a small amount of data and inconsistency of the ice cover period between reservoirs he et al 2011 shourian et al 2016 comparative analyses could not be carried out and general conclusion could not be drawn on the other hand full ice cover has an impact on both the structure and function of aquatic ecosystem mcmeans et al 2020 and reservoir tn dynamics may show another completely novel pattern with the growing number of publication data the dds framework can be further improved and applied to separate studies of tn dynamics for ice covered reservoirs in future work by further improving the dds framework a separate discussion of tn dynamics for ice covered reservoirs should be conducted in future results of data extraction and grouping from reservoirs demonstrated the low accessibility and availability of raw data for a large number of studies in some of the literature where data were accessible sampling details including geographic location number of sampling sites and distance from the dam were not indicated in the text reducing data availability in response to this shortcoming scholars in the field of hydrology have developed survey tools for self assessment of data availability and reproducibility to aid authors in evaluating their manuscripts and improve data accessibility before publication stagge et al 2019 which are worth replicating in other fields inappropriate processing of raw data reduces results credibility and data availability tn variability in reservoirs is subject to a combination of regional hydrologic disturbances and internal regulatory mechanisms and even tn dynamics in the same reservoir often exhibit asynchronous patterns across sampling location depths and interannual for example the pao cachinche reservoir venezuela mentioned above is used for drinking water supply and agricultural irrigation but can have untreated municipal and farming wastewater sinks in its watershed gonzalez et al 2004 this large reservoir has different seasonal dynamics of nitrogen patterns at different sampling sites within a reservoir ecosystem its physical chemical and biological factors interact and exhibit multi dimensional variability xu et al 2012 thus driving spatiotemporal heterogeneity of water quality parameters this also means that the average value of multiple stratified sampling points or multi year may not necessarily represent trends of nutrient dynamics nearly 30 of monthly tn time series were averaged without considering spatiotemporal differences smoothing and masking out variability on spatiotemporal scales thus we decided not to utilize those data which was also a cause of the low data availability of tn time series this also demonstrates the necessity to understand how various parameters fluctuate synchronously or asynchronously on a spatiotemporal scale before determining monitoring protocols and data processing methods for long term observations of aquatic ecosystem dynamics vilmin et al 2018a data sharing and extensive data accumulation at spatiotemporal scales are key to future explorations of patterns of seasonal dynamics of environmental parameters in reservoir ecosystems on a global scale some popular study areas e g three gorges reservoir were monitored by different institutions over the same time period however due to the lack of collaborations cooperation and sharing mechanisms monitoring data and results were not well integrated and explored improvements in data sharing would allow us to assess potential water quality problems from a global perspective at the regional level many studies have been conducted on tn in reservoirs with the highest foci in north america europe and asia this reflects the capacity for large scale studies in these regions and offers the possibility to create global datasets with broad geographic coverage however tn time series extracted from south america and africa are still limited indeed our ability to accurately assess the dynamics of global reservoir tn relies on the accumulation of a range of spatiotemporal scale observations integrating spatiotemporal data into a framework and applying them in analyses of seasonal dynamics in reservoir ecosystems will provide new insights into the mechanisms that dynamics of environmental parameters in reservoirs in general 5 conclusion and future suggestions in this study a data extraction data grouping and statistical analysis framework dds framework was proposed for identifying seasonal dynamics of water quality parameters workflow of dds framework was illustrated with the example of total nitrogen tn in reservoirs with a total of 1722 publications our employment of this framework produced 58 time series data of tn from 19 reservoirs indicating that accessibility and availability of monthly data for tn provided in the publications were not high among the three patterns of tn seasonal dynamics identified tn concentrations in pattern v sum showed a decreasing and then increasing trend over the year with a minimum value occurring in early summer phytoplankton growth and precipitation were the main causes of this pattern in pattern p sum tn was mainly influenced by nitrate wet deposition and agricultural runoff which tends to first increase during the year and then decrease reaching a peak in later summer in pattern p spr the peak in tn concentrations occurred in spring with a decreasing trend after early summer and was mainly caused by anthropogenic discharges understanding the tn seasonal dynamics in reservoirs will help in reservoir water quality pollution control and management the underlying mechanisms of tn patterns and their causes are still at a high level of uncertainty low data accessibility and availability constrain further exploration of tn dynamics in reservoirs dynamics of water quality parameters in reservoir ecosystems are often influenced by complex biotic and abiotic interactions this means that most patterns of seasonal dynamics cannot be characterized by linear models tn dynamics may be influenced by multiple and uncertain sources especially in large reservoirs where the diversity of pollution sources allows for spatiotemporal heterogeneity in nitrogen dynamics however data gaps in some water quality parameters limit the interpretation of tn dynamics for example chl a and air temperature as indicators affecting ecological status of water quality as well water temperature and runoff in reservoir ecosystems respectively did not show the expected correlations with tn in patterns v sum and p sum this indicates that tn has a complex relationship with these parameters and is also controlled by other environmental factors not considered application of this dds framework identifies primary issues to be addressed in spatiotemporal dynamic studies of water quality parameters i e emphasizing the significance of data sharing and the necessity to improve accessibility and availability of raw data sharing raw data through easily accessible platforms can increase the efficiency of reusing published data and facilitate deeper information mining because of spatiotemporal heterogeneity of dynamic variations in water quality parameters data processing without considering characteristics of parameter variations will also affect the availability of accessible data therefore data sharing needs to take into account principles of accessibility and reusability the proposed dds framework can be extended to other aquatic ecosystems to identify more parameter dynamics while providing guidance for more comprehensive ecosystem pollution control and management declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not

16892,investigation of seasonal variations of water quality parameters is essential for understanding the mechanisms of structural changes in aquatic ecosystems and their pollution control despite the ongoing rise in scientific production on spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of water quality parameters such as total nitrogen tn in reservoirs attempts to use published data and incorporate them into a large scale comparison and trends analyses are lacking here we propose a framework of data extraction data grouping and statistical analysis dds and illustrate application of this dds framework with the example of tn in reservoirs among 1722 publications related to tn in reservoirs 58 tn time series data from 19 reservoirs met the analysis requirements and were extracted using the dds framework we performed statistical analysis on these time series data using dynamic time warping dtw combined with agglomerative hierarchical clustering as well as generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss three patterns of seasonal tn dynamics were identified in pattern v sum tn concentrations change in a v shape dropping to its lowest value in summer in pattern p sum tn increases in late summer early fall before decreasing again and in pattern p spr tn peaks in spring identified patterns were driven by phytoplankton growth and precipitation pattern v sum nitrate wet deposition and agricultural runoff pattern p sum and anthropogenic discharges pattern p spr application of the dds framework has identified a key bottleneck in assessing the dynamics of tn low data accessibility and availability providing an easily accessible data sharing platform and increasing the accessibility and availability of raw data for research will facilitate improvements and expand the applicability of the dds framework identification of additional spatiotemporal patterns of water quality parameters can provide new insights for more comprehensive pollution control and management of aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reservoir total nitrogen seasonal dynamics data mining 1 introduction reservoirs are artificial freshwater ecosystems built to meet basic water needs for human activities purposes of reservoirs include water security to support fundamental human requirements such as drinking water food energy as well as human health and general well being although water surface area of reservoirs accounts for only 6 of the global lentic waters they trap 33 of the total nitrogen tn removed from terrestrial ecosystems by lentic systems nitrogen burial and denitrification harrison et al 2009 and serve as important nitrogen storage sites in reservoir ecosystems nitrogen plays a key role in sustaining primary production and biogeochemical cycles and its cellular demand is higher than that of nutrients such as phosphorus and iron andersen et al 2020 hecky and kilham 1988 nevertheless negative impacts of excessive nitrogen due to anthropogenic exogenous and endogenous loadings e g agricultural fertilization soil erosion atmospheric deposition and decompositions of plants and algae on reservoir ecosystems and human health galloway et al 2004 have been well documented for instance surplus nutrient loading can lead to non nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria becoming superior competitors huisman et al 2018 and resulting cyanobacterial blooms not only deteriorate water quality but also release algal toxins that harm ecological health gaget et al 2017 water quality problems in reservoirs caused by eutrophication and harmful algal blooms have been of great concern and present a global challenge huang et al 2020 understanding patterns of seasonal tn dynamics in reservoirs is often a prerequisite for reversing current water quality problems and managing reservoir ecosystems over the past decades researchers have focused on how to alleviate the above mentioned negative effects caused by reservoir excess nitrogen and sustainably maintain reservoir ecosystem services examples include investigating trophic state and seasonal changes in south korean reservoirs jones et al 2003 assessing reservoir trophic status and impact on phytoplankton xu et al 2010 and examining spatiotemporal distribution variability of nutrients during a wet and dry year williamson et al 2020 these studies used different data processing and statistical methods to investigate distribution characteristics of water quality parameters at local scales and paradigms cannot be generalized and applied to other reservoirs to our knowledge no studies have attempted to analyze reservoir tn dynamics on a global scale and incorporated environmental factors such as climate and hydrology this is partly due to weak optical activity of reservoir tn which has spatiotemporal variation and the limited ability to monitor and predict its dynamics by satellite remote sensing vakili and amanollahi 2020 fortunately availability of tn monitoring data for water quality in existing publications offers the potential to meet large scale trend studies in tn dynamics how to mine existing data from the literature and analyze them scientifically and statistically is key to study dynamics of water quality parameters most studies that focus on dynamics of environmental parameters over time have collected multi scale datasets with spatiotemporal variability thus selection of appropriate grouping and fitting methods is beneficial for the interpretation of time series data and pattern recognition li et al 2021 time series clustering methods are powerful tools for analyzing patterns of seasonal dynamics and identifying overall spatiotemporal characteristics of parameters among many time series similarities measures dynamic time warping dtw currently consists of the most widely applied and effective algorithms and is most effective at finding the best alignment and measuring distances dupas et al 2016 lottig et al 2017 wang et al 2020 undoubtedly it is feasible to use dtw to measure distances and differences between time series data furthermore generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss was used to fit the seasonal dynamics this model is widely employed in hydrological time series modeling as a flexible statistical modeling approach li and tan 2015 lópez and francés 2013 su and chen 2019 here we proposed a framework of data extraction data grouping and statistical analysis dds framework aimed at assessing dynamic variations of water quality parameters taking tn in reservoirs as an example the framework is applied to extract and statistically analyze literature data to explore the following research questions 1 how can time series data be most efficiently collected from the existing literature 2 what are the patterns of tn seasonal dynamics in reservoirs 3 what are the causes of tn dynamics application of the dds framework for tn dynamic exploration contributes to the eutrophication control and management of reservoir ecosystems meanwhile key issues in the data mining and dynamic exploration of water quality parameters with tn as an example were demonstrated and the significance of current data sharing and improving the accessibility and availability of raw data to promote pollution management in aquatic ecosystems is emphasized 2 methods the dds framework shown in fig 1 demonstrates whole process of extracting grouping and statistically analyzing the time series data taking reservoir tn as an example first retrieved literatures are screened and time series data are extracted then obtained time series data are sorted and grouped finally time series clustering and fitting are performed on the data sets that met analytical requirements to obtain tn patterns combined with other environmental factors the causes of seasonal variations of tn were identified 2 1 data extraction first a search was performed in web of science core collection for literature published from 1990 to 2020 using the terms reservoir and nutrient and nitrogen in the web of science topic search fig 1a the scope of topic search includes the title abstract and keywords list of the publication a total of 1722 documents were retrieved among the retrieved documents 1351 were available for download as pdf files then we reviewed the full texts of these 1351 documents and found 909 that contained surface water data from the reservoirs further manual screening identified 113 documents containing tn dynamics data and the remaining documents that did not provide tn data or only measured other forms of nitrogen data were excluded these data were presented in 21 tables and 97 figures within the 113 documents we obtained those data either directly from tables or using the getdata graph digitizer software v2 26 http www getdata graph digitizer com from figures some studies performed multi point or stratified sampling i e multiple time series could be obtained in these studies thus a total of 172 time series were obtained 2 2 data grouping the 172 extracted time series data were classified into annual seasonal monthly weekly and daily sampling frequencies fig 1b analyses of tn concentrations on a quarterly or annual monitoring frequency mask seasonal dynamics of reservoir ecosystem structure and other environmental factors kong et al 2019 and these data were not considered daily and weekly scale data were excluded from this study due to absence of 12 period monitoring or missing data or the fact that data were averaged moreover monthly time scale accounted for more than 68 117 of tn time series and thus we focused our analyses on those data tn data were then classified as to whether they were based on averaged or non averaged data we discarded the 35 time series that only provided averaged monthly data the remaining 82 data that provided non averaged data were subdivided into three categories based on the duration of their monitoring time series with a monitoring duration shorter than 12 months 24 time series were excluded from this study as they did not provide a complete annual picture of tn dynamics to facilitate analyses of monthly time series of different durations this study cut data series that had monitoring data between 12 and 24 months 37 time series to a consistent 12 month time span time series that exceeded 24 months were split into 21 sub series with 12 months duration each the 58 time series were further classified according to their spatial data collecting protocol single point multipoint layered and multipoint layered sampling of various water depths sampling overall we analyzed 58 time series from 19 different reservoirs table s1 we retrieved a single time series from eleven reservoirs for eight reservoirs we were able to extract between 2 to 12 time series data data sets that stemmed from the same reservoir were either collected at different times locations or water depths processing of the above time series is based on our assumption that tn dynamics from the same reservoir may also vary depending on sampling time location and water depths see section 3 2 for a detailed discussion usage of averaged data could have made the true trends of tn patterns invisible during our analyses 2 3 statistical analysis the time series data were standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 before analyses fig 1c an agglomerative hierarchical cluster was performed to group tn time series using ward s minimum variance algorithm with dynamic time warping dtw dtw algorithm was used to measure distances between clusters with the smallest sum of squared deviations and is calculated based on the minimum distance of all possible alignments sakoe and chiba 1978 we used the dtw package in the r software for time series cluster analysis once clusters were identified generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss with cubic spline regression was applied to fit patterns of tn seasonal dynamics of all time series in each cluster as a semiparametric or parametric regression model gamlss relaxes the assumptions about the type of distribution of the response variables and can describe any linear or non linear relationship between the variables rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 best fitting distribution was selected based on values of the akaike information criterion aic during gamlss fitting the gamlss package in the r software was used to run gamlss models to investigate the causes of tn dynamics we also collected data on basic information water quality indicators

collected from the literature containing tn dynamic data sampling dates latitude and longitude of sampling sites monthly concentrations data of total phosphorus nitrate n ammonia n and chlorophyll a chl a the extraction and pre processing method of water quality parameters data are consistent with that of tn time series data not all literature contains the above data but at least sampling dates information is required precipitation air temperature mixing depth water temperature and runoff depth were obtained from the climate data store ndvi data were downloaded from the nasa earth observation website to reduce the uncertainty of analysis data obtained from the database were selected for periods corresponding to the tn sampling dates the specific sources and information of each parameter were detailed in table s1 parameter information spearman correlation analyses were performed on monthly datasets of climatic parameters water quality indicators runoff depths and ndvi we used the openair package in the r software to run correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 geographical coverage of total nitrogen tn time series dataset the 58 monthly tn time series data used for analyses originated from 19 reservoirs on five continents fig 2 with broad geographical coverage but were located mainly in asia 10 reservoirs and europe 5 reservoirs the remaining time series were extracted from belle mina reservoir and lake waco reservoir usa pao cachinche reservoir venezuela and yaacoub al mansour reservoir morocco detailed information on the location of the reservoirs can be found in supplementary materials table s1 reservoir information 3 2 spatiotemporal characterization of tn dynamics tn time series data were divided into three clusters fig 3 twenty two tn time series from nine reservoirs on five continents formed cluster 1 tn concentrations in this cluster ranged from 0 03 to 9 12 mg l 1 with an average of 1 44 1 31 mg l 1 the coefficient of variation reached 90 62 and the degree of data dispersion was high the average upper and lower quartiles and the peak of probability density function distribution for cluster 1 were all lower than for cluster 2 and 3 the 16 tn timer series in cluster 2 were from eight reservoirs on four continents with tn ranging from 0 37 to 5 42 mg l 1 and an average of 1 92 1 01 mg l 1 the coefficient of variation was 52 61 and the degree of data dispersion was relatively small for cluster 3 the 20 tn time series came from nine reservoirs on four continents tn concentrations in this cluster ranged from 0 20 to 13 76 mg l 1 with an average of 2 59 2 16 mg l 1 and a coefficient of variation of 83 33 in contrast the average and upper quartile values for cluster 3 were higher than those for cluster 2 tn time series from multiple sampling sites within an individual reservoir were not all spatially similar in their tn dynamics and tn sub time series from same sampling sites over multiple years were not all temporally similar for example while the six time series data collected from different sampling locations of three gorge reservoir all fell into cluster 2 the data from five different sampling locations from qingcaosha reservoir were separated into clusters 1 and 2 and the four time series data stemming from different water surface sampling sites of pao cachinche reservoir ended up in clusters 2 and 3 similarly data sets from different water layers depths could cluster together pao cachinche reservoir or separate shingu reservoir simajigawa reservoir and data sets retrieved from the same reservoir but during different years could end up in the same baihua reservoir lake glebokie reservoir simajihawa reservoir surface layer or different clusters belle mina reservoir simajihawa reservoir middle and bottom layers three patterns of seasonal tn dynamics were identified by fitting the time series in each cluster using the cubic spline function of the gamlss model pattern summer valley v sum fit a power exponential pattern summer peak p sum an ex gaussian and pattern spring peak p spr a skew normal type 2 distribution filliben correlation coefficients were greater than 0 98 for all models and the quality of fit met analytical requirements in all cases the lowest tn concentration for pattern v sum is reached during the summer resulting in a v shape fig 4 a in pattern p sum tn concentration increased in spring peaked in summer and then decreased again reaching its lowest values during the winter months fig 4b in pattern p spr tn increased early in the year and reached a peak in spring and decreased during the summer and fall fig 4c 3 3 correlation between tn and other environmental factors to investigate the causes of tn seasonal dynamics spearman correlations between climate parameters water quality indicators monthly runoff depths and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were analyzed in pattern v sum there were significant and strong positive correlations between tn and tp as well as tn and nitrate n r 0 59 and 0 75 respectively p 0 01 and negative correlations between tn and precipitation tn and ndvi as well as tn and mixing depth r 0 21 0 27 and 0 43 respectively p 0 01 fig 5 a in pattern p sum there were weak positive correlations between tn and tp r 0 25 tn and monthly runoff depth r 0 21 and a negative correlation between tn and mixing depth r 0 45 fig 5b in pattern p spr tn was correlated with nitrate n r 0 78 tp r 0 64 and chl a r 0 52 p 0 01 in all cases fig 5c like the two previous patterns mixing depth was again negatively correlated with tn r 0 88 in pattern p spr additionally all three patterns showed strong negative correlations between tp and tn tp mass ration r 0 74 r 0 88 and r 0 78 respectively p 0 01 in all cases in all three patterns the three parameters tn and air temperature as well as water temperature clustered in the same cluster but did not show significant correlations 4 discussions 4 1 pattern v sum and its potential causes phytoplankton communities play an important role in tn dynamics in pattern v sum fig 4d the negative correlation between tn and ndvi further confirmed that phytoplankton growth likely influenced tn concentration during the growth period phytoplankton take up more nutrients thus reducing their concentration and resulting in the lowest tn concentrations during the summer yang et al 2020 nitrate n concentrations showed similar trends to tn fig s1b and were negatively correlated with water temperature this could be the result of increased water temperature reduced reservoir load and enhanced phytoplankton uptake and denitrification during summer months wang 2020 phytoplankton accelerates the deposition of nutrients and prevents their resuspension of nutrients from the sediment contributing to stabilization of the water column and further reducing nutrient concentrations qi et al 2019 the low temperature winter conditions in the reservoir inhibit aquatic biological activity and lead to low oxygen consumption which decreases the absorption adsorption and deposition of nutrients as a result tn content was higher in both fall and winter compared to summer tn dynamics of pattern v sum were also related to monthly precipitation precipitation patterns are the potential factor in changing the dynamics of water quality parameters atique and an 2020 the negative correlation between tn and monthly precipitation indicates that precipitation affected seasonal variations in tn summer dominated precipitation especially in june caused a significant decrease in tn concentrations due to dilution effects fig s1i furthermore large amounts of runoff that converge after heavy precipitation promote reservoir mixing increase dissolved oxygen levels in the water body and inhibit release of nutrients from the sediment resulting in lower algal biomass in the reservoir li et al 2015 chl a concentrations and chl a tn ratios showed a decreasing trend in summer and we speculate that dilution effect of tn and algae caused by heavy precipitation was stronger during this period tp dynamics in spring and summer were synchronous with tn and there was a moderate negative correlation between tp and precipitation this is consistent with the hypothesis that precipitations have a diluting impact on nutrients dupas et al 2018 tn tp chl a tn and chl a tp ratios are often used as indicators of potential nutrient limitation in reservoirs spears et al 2013 compared to the other two patterns chl a tp ratios were relatively high in pattern v sum and more than 60 of tn tp ratios were greater than 22 6 indicating phosphorus acts as a potentially limiting factor mamun et al 2020 qin et al 2020 chl a tn ratios increased and then decreased in the first half of the year probably due to dilution of tn resulting in transient nitrogen limitation of algae the time series samples in pattern v sum were mainly from drinking water reservoirs such as qingcaosha reservoir and shimajigawa reservoir where the nutrient loads mainly stemmed from natural origin chen and zhu 2018 komatsu et al 2006 in short tn dynamics in pattern v sum were primarily influenced by phytoplankton activity and precipitation and were subject to relatively little human perturbation and had a more healthy natural catchment area 4 2 pattern p sum and its potential causes nitrate wet deposition and agricultural runoff were the factors that dominated tn dynamics in pattern p sum fig 4e a comparison of nitrate n concentrations with corresponding precipitation distribution showed a relationship between nitrate n and precipitation peaking at the same time in summer june fig s1b and i nitrate wet deposition may be the cause of increased nitrogen load in summer because atmospheric nitrogen may have been transformed to nitrate n by nitrification and reached reservoir areas in the form of precipitation hao et al 2017 however tn was not strongly correlated with nitrate and ammonia n and its concentration did not increase to its peak until late summer this may have been caused by surface runoff accumulating after the precipitation period and carrying large amounts of nutrient rich pollutants into the water wang et al 2018 this hypothesis is supported by the positive correlation between tn and monthly runoff depth the sum of surface runoff and sub surface runoff precipitation induced soil erosion can cause an increase in tp and tn loads of water leigh et al 2010 but while tp and runoff depth were negatively correlated neither one exhibited a strong correlation with tn this indicates that tn was not primarily derived from soil erosion additionally nitrate n is closely related to leaching of agricultural nitrogen fertilizers ferrier et al 2001 following heavy precipitation events in summer nitrate n concentrations in pattern p sum were higher than those in the other two patterns and the high proportion of nitrate n compared to ammonia n this probably demonstrates that agricultural runoff has a greater influence on tn dynamics compared to urban inputs al taani 2011 chl a and tn reached the highest values during the same season indicating that stored nutrients and warmer temperatures tend to trigger algal blooms in the summer a decreasing trend in tn concentrations began in the fall which was associated with a decrease in agricultural runoff 4 3 pattern p spr and its potential causes tn dynamics in pattern p spr were mainly attributed to anthropogenic discharges fig 4f a majority of time series samples for this pattern were taken from pao cachinche reservoir and glebokie lake which receive untreated wastewaters from human and animal resulting in eutrophic hypertrophic state gonzalez et al 2004 miller et al 2016 tn tp ratios of pattern p spr were relatively low compared to the other patterns fig s1g reservoirs that are more subjected to agricultural and urban runoff tended to have lower tn tp ratios compared to reservoirs that are exposed to fewer human disturbances mamun et al 2020 in the tn composition the average proportion of inorganic nitrogen reached more than 57 and the proportion of nitrate n and ammonia n was equal which may be attributed to sewage discharge grabb et al 2021 vilmin et al 2018b positive correlations between tn and nitrate n r 0 78 as well as tn and ammonia n r 0 23 further indicated that anthropogenic activities such as agricultural industrial and domestic sewage were the main sources of nitrogen contamination guo et al 2020 agricultural wastewater discharges are most likely to contribute to tn dynamics in pattern p spr activities such as tillage and irrigation are particularly frequent in spring this is accompanied by the discharge of agricultural wastewater rich in nutrients resulting in abnormally high levels of tn during this period zhang et al 2020 as crops are harvested and agricultural activities decrease tn concentrations decrease most of the time series samples in this pattern were located at shallower depth locations such as those at globokie lake and marcali reservoir where the water depth was less than 2 5 m matyas et al 2003 miller et al 2016 thus external anthropogenic disturbances had a greater impact on their water chemistry pattern p spr exhibited higher levels of chl a and tn concentrations compared to the other two patterns fig s1f this is attributed to the fact that reservoirs located in agricultural and urban areas receive relatively more nutrients atique and an 2020 in pattern p spr the increased spring temperature in spring has potential to stimulate phytoplankton growth i e excessive nutrient accumulation is likely to trigger algal blooms in spring liang et al 2020 chl a increased substantially in spring probably because excess nutrient storage tended to trigger algal blooms during that time most of the tn especially in patterns p sum and p spr were greater than 1 mg l 1 demonstrating that most reservoirs are nitrogen rich waters the correlation between chl a and tp was stronger compared to chl a and tn this suggests that tp had more influence on changes of aquatic biomass in nitrogen rich waters which is consistent with the results of other lakes and reservoirs studies søndergaard et al 2017 wang 2020 4 4 challenge of pattern analysis and significance of data availability and sharing we identified tn dynamics in reservoirs but due to limited data there may still be other patterns that were not detected in this study we did not use the tn data from two ice covered reservoirs on one hand because of a small amount of data and inconsistency of the ice cover period between reservoirs he et al 2011 shourian et al 2016 comparative analyses could not be carried out and general conclusion could not be drawn on the other hand full ice cover has an impact on both the structure and function of aquatic ecosystem mcmeans et al 2020 and reservoir tn dynamics may show another completely novel pattern with the growing number of publication data the dds framework can be further improved and applied to separate studies of tn dynamics for ice covered reservoirs in future work by further improving the dds framework a separate discussion of tn dynamics for ice covered reservoirs should be conducted in future results of data extraction and grouping from reservoirs demonstrated the low accessibility and availability of raw data for a large number of studies in some of the literature where data were accessible sampling details including geographic location number of sampling sites and distance from the dam were not indicated in the text reducing data availability in response to this shortcoming scholars in the field of hydrology have developed survey tools for self assessment of data availability and reproducibility to aid authors in evaluating their manuscripts and improve data accessibility before publication stagge et al 2019 which are worth replicating in other fields inappropriate processing of raw data reduces results credibility and data availability tn variability in reservoirs is subject to a combination of regional hydrologic disturbances and internal regulatory mechanisms and even tn dynamics in the same reservoir often exhibit asynchronous patterns across sampling location depths and interannual for example the pao cachinche reservoir venezuela mentioned above is used for drinking water supply and agricultural irrigation but can have untreated municipal and farming wastewater sinks in its watershed gonzalez et al 2004 this large reservoir has different seasonal dynamics of nitrogen patterns at different sampling sites within a reservoir ecosystem its physical chemical and biological factors interact and exhibit multi dimensional variability xu et al 2012 thus driving spatiotemporal heterogeneity of water quality parameters this also means that the average value of multiple stratified sampling points or multi year may not necessarily represent trends of nutrient dynamics nearly 30 of monthly tn time series were averaged without considering spatiotemporal differences smoothing and masking out variability on spatiotemporal scales thus we decided not to utilize those data which was also a cause of the low data availability of tn time series this also demonstrates the necessity to understand how various parameters fluctuate synchronously or asynchronously on a spatiotemporal scale before determining monitoring protocols and data processing methods for long term observations of aquatic ecosystem dynamics vilmin et al 2018a data sharing and extensive data accumulation at spatiotemporal scales are key to future explorations of patterns of seasonal dynamics of environmental parameters in reservoir ecosystems on a global scale some popular study areas e g three gorges reservoir were monitored by different institutions over the same time period however due to the lack of collaborations cooperation and sharing mechanisms monitoring data and results were not well integrated and explored improvements in data sharing would allow us to assess potential water quality problems from a global perspective at the regional level many studies have been conducted on tn in reservoirs with the highest foci in north america europe and asia this reflects the capacity for large scale studies in these regions and offers the possibility to create global datasets with broad geographic coverage however tn time series extracted from south america and africa are still limited indeed our ability to accurately assess the dynamics of global reservoir tn relies on the accumulation of a range of spatiotemporal scale observations integrating spatiotemporal data into a framework and applying them in analyses of seasonal dynamics in reservoir ecosystems will provide new insights into the mechanisms that dynamics of environmental parameters in reservoirs in general 5 conclusion and future suggestions in this study a data extraction data grouping and statistical analysis framework dds framework was proposed for identifying seasonal dynamics of water quality parameters workflow of dds framework was illustrated with the example of total nitrogen tn in reservoirs with a total of 1722 publications our employment of this framework produced 58 time series data of tn from 19 reservoirs indicating that accessibility and availability of monthly data for tn provided in the publications were not high among the three patterns of tn seasonal dynamics identified tn concentrations in pattern v sum showed a decreasing and then increasing trend over the year with a minimum value occurring in early summer phytoplankton growth and precipitation were the main causes of this pattern in pattern p sum tn was mainly influenced by nitrate wet deposition and agricultural runoff which tends to first increase during the year and then decrease reaching a peak in later summer in pattern p spr the peak in tn concentrations occurred in spring with a decreasing trend after early summer and was mainly caused by anthropogenic discharges understanding the tn seasonal dynamics in reservoirs will help in reservoir water quality pollution control and management the underlying mechanisms of tn patterns and their causes are still at a high level of uncertainty low data accessibility and availability constrain further exploration of tn dynamics in reservoirs dynamics of water quality parameters in reservoir ecosystems are often influenced by complex biotic and abiotic interactions this means that most patterns of seasonal dynamics cannot be characterized by linear models tn dynamics may be influenced by multiple and uncertain sources especially in large reservoirs where the diversity of pollution sources allows for spatiotemporal heterogeneity in nitrogen dynamics however data gaps in some water quality parameters limit the interpretation of tn dynamics for example chl a and air temperature as indicators affecting ecological status of water quality as well water temperature and runoff in reservoir ecosystems respectively did not show the expected correlations with tn in patterns v sum and p sum this indicates that tn has a complex relationship with these parameters and is also controlled by other environmental factors not considered application of this dds framework identifies primary issues to be addressed in spatiotemporal dynamic studies of water quality parameters i e emphasizing the significance of data sharing and the necessity to improve accessibility and availability of raw data sharing raw data through easily accessible platforms can increase the efficiency of reusing published data and facilitate deeper information mining because of spatiotemporal heterogeneity of dynamic variations in water quality parameters data processing without considering characteristics of parameter variations will also affect the availability of accessible data therefore data sharing needs to take into account principles of accessibility and reusability the proposed dds framework can be extended to other aquatic ecosystems to identify more parameter dynamics while providing guidance for more comprehensive ecosystem pollution control and management declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not

16893,intermittent water supplies iws are routinely experienced by drinking water distribution systems around the world either due to ongoing operational practices or due to one off interruptions during iws events changing conditions may impact the endemic biofilms leading to hydraulic mobilisation of organic and inorganic materials attached to pipes walls with a resulting degradation in water quality to study the impact of iws on the microbiological and physico chemical characteristics of drinking water an experimental full scale chlorinated pipe facility was operated over 60 days under realistic hydraulic conditions to allow for biofilm growth and to investigate flow resumption behaviour post iws events of 6 48 and 144 hours turbidity and metal concentrations showed significant responses to flow restarting indicating biofilm changes with events greater than 6 hours generating more turbidity responses and hence discolouration risk the increase in pressure when the system was restarted showed a substantial increase in total cell counts while the subsequent increases in flow led to elevated turbidity and metals concentrations suva254 monitoring indicated that shorter times of non water supply increased the risk of aromatic organic compounds and hence risk of disinfection by products formation dna sequencing indicated that increasing iws times resulted in increased relative abundance of potential pathogenic microorganisms such as mycobacterium sphingomonas and the fungi penicillium and cladosporium overall findings indicate that shorter iws result in a higher proportion of aromatic organic compounds which can potentially react with chlorine and increase risk of disinfection by products formation however by minimising iws times biofilm associated impacts can be reduced yet these are complex ecosystems and much remains to be understood about how microbial interactions can be managed to best ensure continued water safe supply graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilms intermittent water supply microbial mobilisation water quality 1 introduction it has been demonstrated that the establishment of continuous water supply is preferential for public health yet currently one third of the world population is supplied via an intermittent water supply iws system who 2017 routine iws can be caused by different environmental and socio economic factors including water stress excessive water losses due to faulty distribution infrastructure energy constraints and cost related to water pumping demands and rapid urbanisation lee and schwab 2005 simukonda et al 2018 notwithstanding perceived safety concerns the practise of iws is expected to increase due to changing demographics water scarcity and climate change vairavamoorthy et al 2008 bivins et al 2017 every network including those with continuous supply experiences interruptions to supply either planned e g asset maintenance repair or replacement or unplanned e g burst valve failure intervention while such interruptions are generally one off they have very similar impacts to ongoing iws the term iws is used hereon to capture both scenarios interruption to supply can disturb the extensive and endemic pipe wall biofilms within drinking water distribution systems dwds leading to water quality deterioration a diverse range of processes during iws can affect biofilms including pressure loss the complete or partial emptying of pipes drying and the flushing effect caused by the system refilling and the flow restarting during iws partially filled pipes and stagnant water can change environmental conditions with the long residence times reducing oxygen and disinfectant agudelo vera blokker and pieterse quirijns 2014 thereby favouring the change of microbial communities and impacting proliferation and this has been observed through increases in total cells and heterotrophic plate counts hpc mesquita et al 2013 changes in biofilm composition or physical traits during iws events may also reduce biofilm shear strengths rendering them less able to resist mobilising shear forces akin to biofilms developed under low shear stress that have shown a less cohesive structure and detach readily when hydraulic conditions change manuel et al 2007 douterelo et al 2013 in addition if pipes are completely drained biofilms can experience air exposure and drying that can affect structural resilience timoner et al 2014 it is therefore considered likely that iws will impact biofilm communities and resulting growth dynamics and alter physical structure when the system is refilled and flow resumes the increases in pressure and flow may result in greater biofilm and associated material mobilisation from the pipe walls into the bulk water kumpel and nelson 2016 system recommissioning when the water supply is resumed may therefore have significant water quality implications such as discolouration taste and odour issues and elevated metals inorganics and pathogen concentrations most iws studies have focused on quantitative operational and hydraulic characteristics disregarding the qualitative and microbial impact yet iws can have important implications and consequences on water safety kumpel and nelson 2016 bivins et al 2017 the impact of biofilm mobilisation into the bulk water has not been explored using microbial molecular methods the aim of this research by simulating realistic network conditions in a full scale chlorinated pipe loop facility that allows laboratory control monitoring and sampling is to provide understanding of how different iws drain down times impact the microbial ecology and water quality dna sequencing was used to investigate the effect of iws on the characteristics and community behaviour with cytometry suva254 ultraviolet absorbance turbidity and multi parameter monitoring tracking organic and inorganic water quality responses knowledge of iws impact on microbial ecology and water quality is essential if network operators are to understand consequences associated with this practice and to develop guidelines and strategies aimed at minimising potential risks and promote delivery of safe water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental pipe facility a full scale experimental chlorinated pipe facility capable of replicating dwds conditions at the university of sheffield uk was used to perform experiments investigating different iws drain down times the facility is comprised of three identical flow and pressure controlled independent loops 9 5 m wide x 21 4 m long coils of high density polyethylene hdpe pipe with an internal diameter of 79 3 mm for full details see douterelo et al 2013 to enable in situ sampling of biofilms developed on the pipe walls each loop had 6 specifically designed removable pipe sections of 0 5 m length fig 1 before the experiments each loop was disinfected by adding 20 mg l of rodolite h rodol ltd liverpool uk a solution of sodium hypochlorite with less than 16 free available chlorine following the protocol described by douterelo et al 2013 2 2 experimental design and conditions to study the effect of iws on microbial communities biofilms were allowed to develop in the experimental pipe facility over 60 days at 20 c and a daily low varied flow lvf regime ranging from 0 2 to 0 5 l s husband et al 2008 see supplementary figure a and supplementary table 1 for more information on the lvf pattern used during the growth and flow rate conversions after the 60 day biofilm growth phase the flow was stopped and the pipes were drained at a constant low flow of 0 06 l s selected as well below the minimum of the lvf profile to minimise likelihood of removing material from the pipe walls in loop 1 the flow was stopped and the pipe was left drained for 6 hours loop 2 for 48 hours and loop 3 for 144 hours ¼ 2 and 6 days fig 2 times were selected to simulate different iws scenarios since iws duration can range from few hours for repair works or daily cycle to several days depending on location and constraints coelho et al 2003 kumpel and nelson 2016 after the designed iws drain down time each loop was re connected to the local supply and filled at a constant flow of 0 2 l s this minimised refill time whilst not surpassing the lowest flow of the lvf profile that had conditioned the shear strength of material attached to pipe wall during the development phase once the pipes were full of water the flow was re started following scheduled stages combining different values of pressure and flow fig 2 first the system was run with the peak values of pressure 2 0 bar and flow 0 54 l s from the lvf development profile stage 0 after this pressure only was increased to 2 9 bar stage 1 and then higher flows 2 3 and 4 1 l s were applied stages 2 and 3 respectively finally an extra stage was performed to test the impact of very high flow 6 1 l s that resulted in a lower 2 3 bar of pressure to achieve stage 4 supplementary figure b shows the theorical flow and pressure applied in each stage of the water supply restarting and supplementary table a provides more information on flow rate conversions of the water supply restarting for each stage transitions between the hydraulic states were performed slowly to avoid dynamic hydraulic conditions such that all forces can be approximated to steady state each stage was performed until flow and pressure values were stabilised and the water run for a minimum of 3 turnovers to provide enough time during the recycling for the water to be mixed and turbidity to stabilise sharpe et al 2010 2 3 water quality physico chemical and biological analysis using discrete water samples in triplicate a range of water quality parameters were analysed at the beginning of the experiment every 20 days during the biofilm growth phase and at each stage post restarting after the different iws times fig 2 water temperature and ph were tested using a hanna

plug in in qiime2 for beta diversity which estimates the degree of differentiation between samples the rarefied otu table was square root transformed and then the bray curtis method was applied to construct similarity matrices using the vegan package v2 5 6 in r oksanen et al 2019 bray curtis resemblance matrices were visualized by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds plots with ggplot2 package v3 2 1 in r wickham and chan 2016 2 6 statistical analysis all biological and physico chemical parameters were measured in triplicate and the mean and standard deviation were calculated in the same way the relative abundance of each otu and the values of alpha diversity indices were calculated as the mean of all replicates analysed for one sample the normality of the data sets was tested before performing significance tests by shapiro wilk test statistical differences between iws times of all physico chemical and biological parameters were tested via the non parametric kruskal wallis test by ranks then if significant differences were observed the non parametric mann whitney u test was used to compare samples pairwise for beta diversity analysis of similarities anosim was applied to bray curtis distance matrices to detect significant differences in biofilm and water microbial communities between iws times p value to establish the impact of different iws times on them the global r statistics was calculated which has values ranging from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates that communities are totally different anderson and walsh 2013 differences were considered statistically significant when p value was 0 05 and all statistical tests were carried out using r software version 3 6 1 r project org team 2014 3 results 3 1 water physico chemical and biological analysis results for water quality parameters during the growth phases and after different iws times are shown in supplementary table b in general the physico chemical analysis showed results consistent between the 3 loops during the 60 days of growth phase with differences observed in several parameters after the different iws times temperature was stable during the growth phase due to the temperature control

limited changes during the test ranging from 6 8 to 7 5 in the 3 loops water disinfectant concentrations were similar over the development phase with total chlorine of 0 37 0 06 mg l and free chlorine of 0 31 0 04 mg l a marked difference can be observed both during initial filling and during stage 0 as the pipe loops are refilled with total chlorine 0 5 0 09 mg l and free chlorine 0 46 0 08 mg l post refilling chorine concentrations decay during the test stages with final concentrations matching those sustained during the development phase for nom water quantification during the growth phase toc and doc showed values ranging from 1 23 to 1 87 mg l and 1 03 to 1 5 mg l respectively supplementary table b with no significant differences p values 0 05 after restarting the water supply toc and doc showed values similar to those in the growth phase and with no significant differences registered in any stage between the 3 different iws times p values 0 05 water suva254 showed an average of 1 44 0 07 l mg m n 12 loop during the growth phase supplementary table b and fig 3 after the water supply restarting the highest values for suva254 were observed after 6 hours of iws followed by 48 hours and 6 days with average values across test stages 2 4 when flow increased above peak conditioning value achieved during the 60 day growth phase being 2 5 1 9 and 1 6 l mg m respectively fig 3 statistical tests supplementary tables c and d confirmed that significant differences were only detected after 6 hours of iws when compared to day 60 p value 0 05 when water suva254 values after the 3

48 hours and 6 days p values 0 05 in stages 2 and 4 significant differences were observed between all iws times p values 0 05 again showing highest values following 6 hours with reducing concentrations from 48 hours to 6 days 3 2 water discolouration iron and manganese concentrations showed similar values for the 3 loops through the biofilm growth phase ranging from 28 19 39 90 µg l and 0 49 0 82µg l respectively supplementary table b with no statistical difference between the 3 loops at any sampling point however when the water supply was restarted after the different iws times an increase in metal concentrations was observed the highest fe concentrations were observed after 6 days iws followed by 48 hours and 6 hours with an average across test stages 2 4 returning 144 157 and 189 μg l respectively statistical test supplementary tables c and e reported significant differences between iws times for stages 2 3 and 4 p values 0 05 when samples were compared pairwise significant differences were found between 6 hours and 6 days on these stages p values 0 05 mn concentrations across test stages 2 4 were 1 6 2 9 and 2 9 μg l respectively statistically higher after 6

in the 3 loops through the biofilm growth phase average ranging from 0 049 to 0 051 ntu in the 3 loops however an increase in turbidity response when the water supply was restarted was observed after all the 3 iws times fig 4 peaks in turbidity response were detected immediately after restarting the water supply which can be associated to a loss of material from the pipe walls when hydraulic forces increase observed turbidity responses can be seen to cycle during each stage in response to imposed flow changes with turbidity monitors situated at the end of the pipe loop prior to a tank and then pump the initial response is a well defined peak and decay and represents material release and transport from the full pipe length this is most clearly observed during stage 0 on start up when velocities are least and is a well reported response observed during flushing events and anticipated based on podds modelling sharpe et al 2010 husband et al 2016 as the water circulates around the pipe loop the turbulent flows for 79 mm pipe transition to a turbulent regime when re 4000 occurs around 0 06 m s or 0 3 l s facilitate effective mixing in the pipe and is sufficient to cause complete mixing within the tank allowing the water and mobilised material to become well mixed this can be observed with turbidity peaks decreasing and values flattening after 3 cycles allowing comparison of overall responses between iws events and imposed conditions turbidity levels after 3 cycles of water turnover of each stage supplementary table b reported similar values for stages 0 and 1 while in stages 2 3 and 4 when flows were increased higher turbidity levels were observed for all iws periods statistical analysis supplementary tables g and h indicated that in stages 0 and 1 turbidity values were significant lower after 6 hours than after 48 hours and 6 days of iws p values 0 05 but there were not significant differences between 48 hours and 6 days p value 0 05 in stages 2 and 3 statistical differences between the 3 iws times were observed p values 0 05 presenting after 6 hours the lowest values followed by 6 days and then by 48 hours in stage 4 turbidity levels after 6 hours of iws were statistically lower p values 0 05 than after 48 hours and 6 days however turbidity response did not show statistical differences between 48 h and 6 days in this stage p value 0 05 3 3 flow cytometer counts results from fcm with tcc and icc of planktonic cells during the growth phase and at each stage of the water supply restarting after different iws times are shown in fig 5 overall tcc increases were observed in all stages after the 3 iws periods than during the growth phase except during stage 0 highest tcc results are observed during stage 1 with decreasing counts during subsequent stages when the different iws times were compared supplementary tables i and j higher significant values of ttc and icc in stages 1 2 3 and 4 were obtained after 6 days of iws than after 6 hours and 48 hours p values 0 05 no significant changes were observed between 6 hours and 48 hours for ttc and icc p value 0 05 3 4 microbial community structure 3 4 1 alpha diversity chao 1 simpson and shannon indices were used to estimate the richness dominance and diversity respectively supplementary figure c shows the results for these diversity indices at genus level for bacteria and fungi

samples between the different iws times p values 0 05 for fungi biofilm communities there were not significant differences between the 3 iws times in samples post iws p value 0 05 post restarting the water supply chao 1 for fungi in biofilm samples did not show significant differences between iws times but simpson was significant higher after 48 hours followed by 6 hours and 6 days p values 0 05 consequently shannon index presented significant lower values after 48 hours than after 6 hours or 6 days p values 0 05 planktonic bacterial communities were not affected by iws events and no significant differences were observed in any index between water samples from the 3 iws times at all the different stages of the water supply restarting p values 0 05 planktonic fungal communities did not show significant differences for chao 1 at any stage of water supply restarting between the different iws times p value 0 05 simpson and shannon indices did not show significant differences in stages 0 3 and 4 p value 0 05 during the water supply restarting but significant changes were observed for these indices in stages 1 and 2 overall fungal communities after 6 hours presented lower significant values for simpson and consequently higher significant shannon values p values 0 05 than fungal communities after 48 hours or 6 days 3 4 2 beta diversity nmds plots with the resemblance of bacteria and fungi communities at genus level in biofilm and water samples after the different iws times are shown in fig 6 for biofilm samples no clear separation of the bacterial and fungal communities was observed the anosim analysis supplementary table o confirmed that no significant differences were found for bacteria between 60 day old biofilms and after 6 hours of iws however the bacterial community structure significantly changed after 48 hours and after 6 days of iws in addition bacterial community structure showed significant differences between the different iws times for fungi in biofilm anosim supplementary table o showed significant differences between 60 day old samples and after 48 hours and 6 days of iws no significant differences were found between 60 day old biofilm and after 6 hours as well as when biofilm fungal communities were compared between the different iws times regarding planktonic communities samples clustered at bacterial genus level for the 3 iws times analysed the anosim analysis supplementary table o confirmed that water samples from day 60 had a significant different bacterial community structure when compared with samples after all iws times significant differences were also found when bacterial communities when compared after the 3 iws times for planktonic fungal communities no clear separation between samples was observed in the nmds anosim confirmed the absence of significant differences between fungal communities of day 60 and after all iws times as well as between planktonic fungal communities after 48 hours compared to 6 hours 6 days however significant changes were observed for fungal planktonic samples after 6 hours and 6 days of iws 3 5 microbial community composition 3 5 1 taxonomic analysis of biofilm communities differences in bacterial and fungal community composition at genus level were observed between 60 days old biofilm samples post iws and biofilm samples post restarting the water supply after the different iws times fig 7 a and b fig 7 a shows the taxonomic analysis of bacteria in all biofilm samples overall 60 days old biofilm samples in the 3 loops were dominated by phreatobacter 33 5 a not defined ns taxa belonging to the order obscuribacterales 17 5 and pseudomonas 10 0 after 6 hours of iws both post iws and post restarting biofilm samples showed similar bacterial profiles to those of day 60 phreatobacter 22 8 and 18 3 flavobacterium 19 9 and 20 1 and a not defined nd taxa within the order obscuribacterales 15 4 and 4 6 presented high relative abundances after 48 hours of iws biofilm bacterial community composition changed when compared to day 60 or after 6 hours of iws in samples post iws aquabacterium 30 1 dominated the community together with phreatobacter 20 4 pseudomonas 17 5 and obscuribacterales nd 14 6 post restarting the water supply after 48 hours of iws biofilm communities showed that obscuribacterales nd 37 3 became the most abundant taxa followed by aquabacterium 15 5 and phreatobacter 7 3 after 6 days of iws samples post iws showed that aquabacterium 35 7 was the most abundant genus together with pseudomonas 11 0 phreatobacter 10 7 and mycobacterium 9 4 in samples post restarting the water supply after 6 days of iws sphingomonas 26 8 was the most abundant genus together with mycobacterium 16 9 and pseudomonas 15 5 fig 7 b shows the taxonomic analysis of fungi in biofilm samples in 60 days old biofilms the most abundant genera were cadophora 22 2 and cladosporium 19 7 followed by ochroconis 8 5 exophiala 7 9 and penicillium 7 4 after 6 hours of iws in samples post iws nectriaceae nd was the dominant taxa 60 7 followed by other taxonomic groups with lower relative abundance such as cladosporium 11 5 after restarting the water supply after 6 hours the relative abundance of cadophora 66 5 increased becoming predominant in the community followed by ochroconis 10 5 after 48 hours iws and post iws the fungal community was dominated by cladosporium 23 6 cadophora 18 9 pleosporales nd 17 4 and cadophora 15 9 post restarting the water supply after 48 hours of iws the fungal community was mainly dominated by ochroconis 46 4 and penicillium 36 5 after 6 days of iws in biofilms post iws the most abundant genera were again ochroconis 24 7 cladosporium 13 8 and didymellaceae nd 19 6 post restarting the water supply after 6 days cladosporium 20 4 became the most abundant genera and other genera such as ochroconis 8 3 or debaryomyces 8 0 presented high relative abundances 3 5 2 taxonomic analysis of planktonic communities differences in bacterial and fungal composition at genus level were observed in planktonic communities when the water supply was restarted after different iws times fig 8 a and b taxonomic analysis of bacteria in water samples fig 8 a showed that on day 60 of the growth phase several genera such a reyranella phreatobacter nevskia sphingomonas methylobacterium or cupriavidus were present with average relative abundances between 12 5 and 6 9 after 6 hours and 48 hours of iws bacterial planktonic communities followed a similar pattern of change through the stages of the water supply restarting in stage 0 sphingomonas 36 6 40 8 and methylobacterium 24 6 26 1 were the most abundant genera however their relative abundance in samples from stage 1 to 4 decreased whilst phreatobacter became dominant 45 5 70 2 a notable increase in the relative abundance of mycobacterium 6 3 11 6 and the taxa belonging to the order obscuribacterales 6 3 11 3 was observed in stages 2 3 and 4 after 48 hours of iws similar results were observed after 6 days of iws in stage 0 with high relative abundance of sphingomonas 37 7 and methylobacterium 23 1 in water samples from stages 1 to 4 sphingomonas 34 1 47 6 continued to be the most abundant genus followed by nevskia 6 3 25 1 and phreatobacter 13 3 21 8 fungal planktonic composition fig 8 b did not show significant changes after the water supply was restarted for the different iws times on day 60 the most abundant planktonic fungi in samples from the 3 loops were cadophora 54 8 sordariomycetes nd 19 3 and exophiala 17 0 after the 3 iws the taxonomic profile of planktonic fungi was similar with high relative abundance of cadophora 9 7 66 7 exophiala 5 1 31 6 and cladosporium 4 1 23 9 4 discussion this research investigated the unexplored impact of iws on the combined hydrological microbiological and physico chemical characteristics of distributed drinking water with the aim of improving distribution system management the study shows a number of findings that highlight considerations for future iws operational practices primary amongst these are that microbial structural and compositional changes in biofilms occurred during iws events and those when combined with hydraulic changes impacted water quality an experimental facility simulating dwds was operated to understand the impact of iws on biofilms based on analysing changes within bulk water after imposing mobilising forces a significant increase in turbidity and inorganic fe and mn concentrations were observed after recommissioning in all 3 iws events under typical conditions mobilisation of biofilm and associated material occurs as shear forces increase with no response until the typical or conditioned state is exceeded chaves simões and simões 2013 douterelo et al 2013 husband 2016 husband et al 2008 sharpe 2010 this is easily understood as no turbidity response was seen on a daily basis during the 60 days of biofilm growth phase whereas a significant turbidity response was clearly linked to pipe wall material mobilisation on restart the restarting flow created forces that eroded material previously conditioned to the same imposed hydraulic shear stress forces from the pipe wall into the bulk flow and subsequent increases also resulted in further discolouration responses supporting validated concepts of cohesive material attachment husband et al 2016 this result indicates that changes occurred within the biofilm during iws with overall response magnitudes indicating least impact from the shortest iws event similar to these observations tokajian and hashwa 2003 found higher turbidity levels when flow was restarted in a small iws system supplied twice a week and cerrato et al 2006 observed higher acute fe and mn concentrations during iws conditions compared to the chronic concentrations found during continuous supply in pvc and iron pipes previous studies have shown that under stagnation biofilms can develop to a greater extent since they are not under hydraulic constraints chaves simões and simões 2013 coelho et al 2003 likewise observed that hpc was higher when the flow was restarted after iws events in different dwds operating from 10 12 hours per 48 hours to twice per week in different locations and kumpel and nelson 2013 reported a greater presence of total coliforms and e coli in a chlorinated dwds system performing under iws kumpel and nelson 2013 in this study higher turbidity and inorganics concentration values were observed with increased iws duration however this distinct discolouration response was not always supported by significant increases in cell counts or suva demonstrating that cell counts should not be considered linked to turbidity and different mobilisation processes between biofilm cells and entrapped material may occur it is hypothesized that longer times under the new changed environmental condition i e drained pipe could result in greater biofilm breakdown and cell death that can then be eroded along with entrapped inorganics by the imposed hydraulic shear forces two conflicting observations however are presented by the tcc results the first is that the highest tcc counts occur during the pressure change stage when no significant turbidity response was observed and the second is the decreasing tcc values observed during the subsequent stages the former does correspond to an increase in suva254 fig 3 and reinforces the hypothesis that there is not a clear correlation between cell counts and turbidity an aspect of water quality monitoring that requires further investigation the latter may be a consequence of exposure to the fresh water with higher incoming disinfectant concentrations which could also help explain the reduction in cell viability observed nescerecka et al 2014 based on the assumption that the established biofilms breakdown i e changed their structure and compactness during drain down is proportional to time for the iws durations examined here a greater cell release and higher discolouration response would be expected after 6 days than after 48 hours of iws turbidity results from stage 2 and 3 supported this for 6 to 48 hours but not for 48 hours to 144 hours suggesting material attached to the pipe walls after 144 hours of iws was more difficult to remove this increased resistance of particulate material release from biofilms after longer iws periods could be explained by the resumption of biofilm development suggested by tcc and icc results strengthening cohesive properties or potential impact of a drying process it has been demonstrated that more than 90 of the wet weight of biofilms is water and thus the absence of water can change the biofilm compactness schmitt and flemming 1999 when the biofilm dries out its internal structure can change and the forces between the cells and the surface are strengthened cerrato et al 2006 observed that biofilm morphology was affected changing its texture and colour when plastic pipes were dried in a system operating under iws this drying process can make the biofilm more compact and increases the difficulty for water to penetrate melo 2005 increasing shear strength properties and consequently higher shear stresses are required to erode them from the pipe this research highlights that many interacting factors are at work and further investigations are needed to understand the combined action of hydraulic forces and pipe microbiome properties of significance is that the large step increase in pressure and not flow during stage 1 from 2 0 to 2 9 bar did not result in a measured turbidity response it is noted that the pipe loop control algorithms were designed to prevent dynamic hydraulic conditions and avoid the shock loads associated with hydraulic transients the change in pressure for each loop took between 6 and 10 seconds far greater than the pressure wave transit time for the system around 2 seconds with no evidence of dynamic pressure transients therefore this research demonstrates that operators are not constrained by water quality risks if undertaking controlled increases in network pressure furthermore the findings highlighted material sensitivity to pipes recommissioning following a single iws event such as one off maintenance activity in networks that are normally run under continuous supply it is therefore likely that networks operated under regular iws would develop biofilms adapted to these cycling conditions and not demonstrate the sensitivity highlighted here although previous work nescerecka et al 2014 has indicated otherwise further experiments running repeating iws events could investigate both community adaptions and subsequent water quality impact and test strategies to minimise responses thereby informing future start up procedures moreover results shown here are based on 60 days old biofilm enough time to detect and monitor discolouration events and changes in microbial communities according to previous studies performed in the same experimental facility douterelo sharpe and boxall 2014 husband et al 2016 fish and boxall 2018 however disruptions in the water supply can happen periodically or for the first time after years of the pipe installation thus affecting biofilms at different maturation stages future investigations on the impact of biofilms in dwds under iws should consider conducting experiments in real networks to better understand microbial risks associated to different periods of iws factors such as pipe age and or material type of disinfection hydraulic regimes and water source can influence biofilm structure and composition douterelo sharpe and boxall 2013 gomez alvarez et al 2015 ren et al 2015 hence can affect final water quality when biofilms are mobilised into the bulk water due to iws the characteristics of nom after different iws times were analysed by determining toc doc and suva these parameters provide measurements of the concentration and type of nom present in water which can react with disinfectants and lead to the formation of harmful disinfection by products dbps matilainen et al 2011 specifically the hydrophobic humic fraction of nom is more reactive with oxidants like chlorine favouring the formation of dbps reckhow et al 1990 weishaar et al 2003 toc and doc results showed typical concentrations previously reported for drinking water douterelo et al 2014 li et al 2018 and no significant differences were observed in any stage after restarting the water supply for the different iws times however the highest suva values measured after 6 hours iws when compared to 48 hours and 144 hours indicated a higher proportion of aromatic organic compounds which can potentially react with chlorine to form dbps the change in environment conditions loss of water drying oxygen levels etc would also impact material transport processes and hence organic material uptake and or increase cell lysis the lack of an evident increased risk for dbps formation after 48 h or 144 hours iws when compared to 6 hours may be linked to insufficient time for the existing biofilm to adapt to the new conditions limiting organic uptake this change in environmental conditions will most likely have a higher impact on the outer more exposed layers of biofilms and could explain the higher suva observed after the initial increase in flow eroding these effected layers in the 6 hour iws test this is relevant as high concentrations of chlorine are commonly used post interventions in the pipe network as a protective measure against contamination that could further exacerbate dbp formation further research could investigate this phenomenon to confirm results and then investigate how quickly increased nom release occurs after draining down to indicate if a reduced operational window exists to minimise impact microbial communities in iws have undergone limited exploration using molecular methods melo 2005 this knowledge gap has been addressed here by analysing mixed microorganisms bacteria and fungi in both planktonic and biofilm communities the compositional changes observed in the microbial communities indicates that environmental changes during iws events affected biofilm communities sequencing results showed that some of bacterial phyla in biofilms enhanced by iws belonged to alpha beta and gamma proteobacteria phylum such as sphingomonas aquabacterium and pseudomonas respectively as well as gram positive bacteria like mycobacterium and non photosynthetic cyanobacteria obscuribacterales nd which have the ability to form endospores and be more resistant to stress conditions like desiccation sandle 2016 regarding planktonic bacterial communities genera like obscuribacteriales nd methylobacterium nevskia phreatobacter mycobacterium and sphingomonas increased their relative abundance after iws periods and when the water supply was restarted after iws time specially phreatobacter mycobacterium and sphingomonas similar communities were identified in both water and biofilm samples from an unchlorinated and chlorinated iws system from beirut lebanon and cali colombia respectively tokajian et al 2005 montoya pachongo et al 2018 this suggests that these genera could be specifically favoured by iws events in terms of health and water quality ercumen et al 2015 showed that iws can lead to waterborne illness and diarrheal diseases through contamination in the pipelines limiting the availability of safe water during intermittencies our findings indicated that iws times especially after longer periods of iws favour the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas mycobacterium and sphingomonas which presented high relative abundances compared to the 60 day old biofilms when the water supply was restarted pseudomonas and mycobacterium genera include species of opportunistic pathogens and its presence in drinking water have been related to nosocomial infections vaerewijck et al 2005 hilborn et al 2006 costa et al 2015 liu et al 2016 who 2017 sphingomonas is well recognized for its ability for extracellular polymeric substances eps formation thus contributing to biofilm development and some species are involved in the infection of immunocompromised patients in hospitals johnsen et al 2000 zhang et al 2012 steinberg and burd 2015 the increase of the relative abundance of these genera in biofilms after longer iws times could have important implications for public health if biofilm is mobilised into the bulk water similarly the presence of methylobacterium in water samples from this study indicates a potential risks since species belonging to this genus can cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients in hospitals due to its ability to form biofilms and to exhibit tolerance to disinfecting agents high temperatures and to drying kovaleva et al 2014 studies regarding fungi in dwds have been gaining attention due to their biofilm formation ability and their interaction with bacteria in fungal bacterial biofilms afonso et al 2020 however there are no iws studies that include the analysis of fungal communities the fungal analysis showed that these microorganisms mainly represented by the ascomycota phylum were less affected by iws events than bacterial communities an indication of the key role fungal communities may play in biofilm stability however the dominance of certain fungi such as cadophora increased with short iws times cadophora is a phytopathogenic fungus but it has not been related to human health problems travadon et al 2015 other fungi such as ochroconis and penicillium dominant in biofilm samples when the water supply was restarted can contain pathogenic species associated to local human infections lyratzopoulos et al 2002 novak babič et al 2017 therefore it can be concluded that monitoring biofilm communities is proven essential since longer iws can increase potential risks associated to pathogenic microorganisms these results provide a starting point for future research on the effects of supply disruption on the dwds microbiome more precise and efficient molecular methods such as quantitative pcr q pcr for the identification and quantification of specific microorganisms smith and osborn 2009 nolan huggett and sanchez 2013 could help to accurately determine the presence of potential pathogens observed in this study trough metagenomics analysis all this knowledge including infrastructure characteristics turbidity thresholds and associated occurrence of potential pathogens could be used to establish an effective microbial risk assessment framework to monitor and control the microbial hazards associated to iws this novel research provides a number of findings that contribute to a better understanding of dwds managed under iws the experiment was not replicated during this research because of the technical difficulties of repeating an experiment of this magnitude in terms of water energy labour and economic expenditure however to the authors knowledge this is the first experiment under controlled conditions about different iws times and their impact on biofilm mobilisation and water quality based on the findings from this research the possible approaches that can be adopted to mitigate biofilm associated risks caused by iws include routine pipe cleaning operations by for example unidirectional flushing slaats et al 2002 douterelo husband and boxall 2014 and air scouring pourcel and duchesne 2020 especially if iws events are expected 5 conclusions for the first time this study shows how different iws events impact distribution system microorganisms and biofilm mobilisation responses and thus impact on water quality from this research several key findings were highlighted short iws events 6 hours resulted in higher concentrations of aromatic organic compounds hence greater risk of potential dbp formation in chlorinated systems pressure increases had no impact on network turbidity whilst flow increases promoted material release and discolouration risk for each subsequent increase turbidity changes do not reflect mobilisation of pipe wall total or intact cell counts iws events promoted changes in structure and taxonomic profiles of dwds biofilm and planktonic communities with i greatest compositional changes observed for longer iws times ii fungal communities changed less than bacterial communities iii changes in planktonic communities observed after the different iws can be associated to biofilm mobilisation and iv relative abundance of potentially pathogenic and or detrimental microorganisms favoured in biofilm samples after iws with increasing incidence for longer iws events these include flavobacterium after 6 hours of iws ochroconis and penicillium after 48 hours of iws and mycobacterium sphingomonas ochroconis and

16893,intermittent water supplies iws are routinely experienced by drinking water distribution systems around the world either due to ongoing operational practices or due to one off interruptions during iws events changing conditions may impact the endemic biofilms leading to hydraulic mobilisation of organic and inorganic materials attached to pipes walls with a resulting degradation in water quality to study the impact of iws on the microbiological and physico chemical characteristics of drinking water an experimental full scale chlorinated pipe facility was operated over 60 days under realistic hydraulic conditions to allow for biofilm growth and to investigate flow resumption behaviour post iws events of 6 48 and 144 hours turbidity and metal concentrations showed significant responses to flow restarting indicating biofilm changes with events greater than 6 hours generating more turbidity responses and hence discolouration risk the increase in pressure when the system was restarted showed a substantial increase in total cell counts while the subsequent increases in flow led to elevated turbidity and metals concentrations suva254 monitoring indicated that shorter times of non water supply increased the risk of aromatic organic compounds and hence risk of disinfection by products formation dna sequencing indicated that increasing iws times resulted in increased relative abundance of potential pathogenic microorganisms such as mycobacterium sphingomonas and the fungi penicillium and cladosporium overall findings indicate that shorter iws result in a higher proportion of aromatic organic compounds which can potentially react with chlorine and increase risk of disinfection by products formation however by minimising iws times biofilm associated impacts can be reduced yet these are complex ecosystems and much remains to be understood about how microbial interactions can be managed to best ensure continued water safe supply graphical abstract image

socio economic factors including water stress excessive water losses due to faulty distribution infrastructure energy constraints and cost related to water pumping demands and rapid urbanisation lee and schwab 2005 simukonda et al 2018 notwithstanding perceived safety concerns the practise of iws is expected to increase due to changing demographics water scarcity and climate change vairavamoorthy et al 2008 bivins et al 2017 every network including those with continuous supply experiences interruptions to supply either planned e g asset maintenance repair or replacement or unplanned e g burst valve failure intervention while such interruptions are generally one off they have very similar impacts to ongoing iws the term iws is used hereon to capture both scenarios interruption to supply can disturb the extensive and endemic pipe wall biofilms within drinking water distribution systems dwds leading to water quality deterioration a diverse range of processes during iws can affect biofilms including pressure loss the complete or partial emptying of pipes drying and the flushing effect caused by the system refilling and the flow restarting during iws partially filled pipes and stagnant water can change environmental conditions with the long residence times reducing oxygen and disinfectant agudelo vera blokker and pieterse quirijns 2014 thereby favouring the change of microbial communities and impacting proliferation and this has been observed through increases in total cells and heterotrophic plate counts hpc mesquita et al 2013 changes in biofilm composition or physical traits during iws events may also reduce biofilm shear strengths rendering them less able to resist mobilising shear forces akin to biofilms developed under low shear stress that have shown a less cohesive structure and detach readily when hydraulic conditions change manuel et al 2007 douterelo et al 2013 in addition if pipes are completely drained biofilms can experience air exposure and drying that can affect structural resilience timoner et al 2014 it is therefore considered likely that iws will impact biofilm communities and resulting growth dynamics and alter physical structure when the system is refilled and flow resumes the increases in pressure and flow may result in greater biofilm and associated material mobilisation from the pipe walls into the bulk water kumpel and nelson 2016 system recommissioning when the water supply is resumed may therefore have significant water quality implications such as discolouration taste and odour issues and elevated metals inorganics and pathogen concentrations most iws studies have focused on quantitative operational and hydraulic characteristics disregarding the qualitative and microbial impact yet iws can have important implications and consequences on water safety kumpel and nelson 2016 bivins et al 2017 the impact of biofilm mobilisation into the bulk water has not been explored using microbial molecular methods the aim of this research by simulating realistic network conditions in a full scale chlorinated pipe loop facility that allows laboratory control monitoring and sampling is to provide understanding of how different iws drain down times impact the microbial ecology and water quality dna sequencing was used to investigate the effect of iws on the characteristics and community behaviour with cytometry suva254 ultraviolet absorbance turbidity and multi parameter monitoring tracking organic and inorganic water quality responses knowledge of iws impact on microbial ecology and water quality is essential if network operators are to understand consequences associated with this practice and to develop guidelines and strategies aimed at minimising potential risks and promote delivery of safe water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental pipe facility a full scale experimental chlorinated pipe facility capable of replicating dwds conditions at the university of sheffield uk was used to perform experiments investigating different iws drain down times the facility is comprised of three identical flow and pressure controlled independent loops 9 5 m wide x 21 4 m long coils of high density polyethylene hdpe pipe with an internal diameter of 79 3 mm for full details see douterelo et al 2013 to enable in situ sampling of biofilms developed on the pipe walls each loop had 6 specifically designed removable pipe sections of 0 5 m length fig 1 before the experiments each loop was disinfected by adding 20 mg l of rodolite h rodol ltd liverpool uk a solution of sodium hypochlorite with less than 16 free available chlorine following the protocol described by douterelo et al 2013 2 2 experimental design and conditions to study the effect of iws on microbial communities biofilms were allowed to develop in the experimental pipe facility over 60 days at 20 c and a daily low varied flow lvf regime ranging from 0 2 to 0 5 l s husband et al 2008 see supplementary figure a and supplementary table 1 for more information on the lvf pattern used during the growth and flow rate conversions after the 60 day biofilm growth phase the flow was stopped and the pipes were drained at a constant low flow of 0 06 l s selected as well below the minimum of the lvf profile to minimise likelihood of removing material from the pipe walls in loop 1 the flow was stopped and the pipe was left drained for 6 hours loop 2 for 48 hours and loop 3 for 144 hours ¼ 2 and 6 days fig 2 times were selected to simulate different iws scenarios since iws duration can range from few hours for repair works or daily cycle to several days depending on location and constraints coelho et al 2003 kumpel and nelson 2016 after the designed iws drain down time each loop was re connected to the local supply and filled at a constant flow of 0 2 l s this minimised refill time whilst not surpassing the lowest flow of the lvf profile that had conditioned the shear strength of material attached to pipe wall during the development phase once the pipes were full of water the flow was re started following scheduled stages combining different values of pressure and flow fig 2 first the system was run with the peak values of pressure 2 0 bar and flow 0 54 l s from the lvf development profile stage 0 after this pressure only was increased to 2 9 bar stage 1 and then higher flows 2 3 and 4 1 l s were applied stages 2 and 3 respectively finally an extra stage was performed to test the impact of very high flow 6 1 l s that resulted in a lower 2 3 bar of pressure to achieve stage 4 supplementary figure b shows the theorical flow and pressure applied in each stage of the water supply restarting and supplementary table a provides more information on flow rate conversions of the water supply restarting for each stage transitions between the hydraulic states were performed slowly to avoid dynamic hydraulic conditions such that all forces can be approximated to steady state each stage was performed until flow and pressure values were stabilised and the water run for a minimum of 3 turnovers to provide enough time during the recycling for the water to be mixed and turbidity to stabilise sharpe et al 2010 2 3 water quality physico chemical and biological analysis using discrete water samples in triplicate a range of water quality parameters were analysed at the

significant when p value was 0 05 and all statistical tests were carried out using r software version 3 6 1 r project org team 2014 3 results 3 1 water physico chemical and biological analysis results for water quality parameters during the growth phases and after different iws times are shown in supplementary table b in general the physico chemical analysis showed results consistent between the 3 loops during the 60 days of growth phase with differences observed in several parameters after the different iws times temperature was stable during the growth phase due to the temperature control within the facility average of 20 3 0 1 c n 12 per loop however after iws when the supply was restarted with fresh supply water the temperature averaged of 17 6 0 3 c n 15 loop ph values showed limited changes during the test ranging from 6 8 to 7 5 in the 3 loops water disinfectant concentrations were similar over the development phase with total chlorine of 0 37 0 06 mg l and free chlorine of 0 31 0 04 mg l a marked difference can be observed both during initial filling and during stage 0 as the pipe loops are refilled with total chlorine 0 5 0 09 mg l and free chlorine 0 46 0 08 mg l post refilling chorine concentrations decay during the test stages with final concentrations matching those sustained during the development phase for nom water quantification during the growth phase toc and doc showed values ranging from 1 23 to 1 87 mg l and 1 03 to 1 5 mg l respectively supplementary table b with no significant differences p values 0 05 after restarting the water supply toc and doc showed values similar to those in the growth phase and with no significant differences registered in any stage between the 3 different iws times p values 0 05 water suva254 showed an average of 1 44 0 07 l mg m n 12 loop during the growth phase supplementary table b and fig 3 after the water supply restarting the highest values for suva254 were observed after 6 hours of iws followed by 48 hours and 6 days with average values across test stages 2 4 when flow increased above peak conditioning value achieved during the 60 day growth phase being 2 5 1 9 and 1 6 l mg m respectively fig 3 statistical tests supplementary tables c and d confirmed that significant differences were only detected after 6 hours of iws when compared to day 60 p value 0 05 when water suva254 values after the 3 iws times were compared significant differences were observed in stages 1 2 and 4 p values 0 05 pairwise comparisons showed higher significant suva254 values in stage 1 after 6 hours of iws than after 48 hours and 6 days p values 0 05 in stages 2 and 4 significant differences were observed between all iws times p values 0 05 again showing highest values following 6 hours with reducing concentrations from 48 hours to 6 days 3 2 water discolouration iron and manganese concentrations showed similar values for the 3 loops through the biofilm growth phase ranging from 28 19 39 90 µg l and 0 49 0 82µg l respectively supplementary table b with no statistical difference between the 3 loops at any sampling point however when the water supply was restarted after the different iws times an increase in metal concentrations was observed the highest fe concentrations were observed after 6 days iws followed by 48 hours and 6 hours with an average across test stages 2 4 returning 144 157 and 189 μg l respectively statistical test supplementary tables c and e reported significant differences between iws times for stages 2 3 and 4 p values 0 05 when samples were compared pairwise significant differences were found between 6 hours and 6 days on these stages p values 0 05 mn concentrations across test stages 2 4 were 1 6 2 9 and 2 9 μg l respectively statistically higher after 6 days than after 6 and 48 hours in all stages p values 0 05 and after 48 h than after 6h in stages 3 and 4 p values 0 05 supplementary tables c and f online turbidity measurements showed similar values in the 3 loops through the biofilm growth phase average ranging from 0 049 to 0 051 ntu in the 3 loops however an increase in turbidity response when the water supply was restarted was observed after all the 3 iws times fig 4 peaks in turbidity response were detected immediately after restarting the water supply which can be associated to a loss of material from the pipe walls when hydraulic forces increase observed turbidity responses can be seen to cycle during each stage in response to imposed flow changes with turbidity monitors situated at the end of the pipe loop prior to a tank and then pump the initial response is a well defined peak and decay and represents material release and transport from the full pipe length this is most clearly observed during stage 0 on start up when velocities are least and is a well reported response observed during flushing events and anticipated based on podds modelling sharpe et al 2010 husband et al 2016 as the water circulates around the pipe loop the turbulent flows for 79 mm pipe transition to a turbulent regime when re 4000 occurs around 0 06 m s or 0 3 l s facilitate effective mixing in the pipe and is sufficient to cause complete mixing within the tank allowing the water and mobilised material to become well mixed this can be observed with turbidity peaks decreasing and values flattening after 3 cycles allowing comparison of overall responses between iws events and imposed conditions turbidity levels after 3 cycles of water turnover of each stage supplementary table b reported similar values for stages 0 and 1 while in stages 2 3 and 4 when flows were increased higher turbidity levels were observed for all iws periods statistical analysis supplementary tables g and h indicated that in stages 0 and 1 turbidity values

statistical differences between the 3 iws times were observed p values 0 05 presenting after 6 hours the lowest values followed by 6 days and then by 48 hours in stage 4 turbidity levels after 6 hours of iws were statistically lower p values 0 05 than after 48 hours and 6 days however turbidity response did not show statistical differences between 48 h and 6 days in this stage p value 0 05 3 3 flow cytometer counts results from fcm with tcc and icc of planktonic cells during the growth phase and at each stage of the water supply restarting after different iws times are shown in fig 5 overall tcc increases were observed in all stages after the 3 iws periods than during the growth phase except during stage 0 highest tcc results are observed during stage 1 with decreasing counts during subsequent stages when the different iws times were compared supplementary tables i and j higher significant values of ttc and icc in stages 1 2 3 and 4 were obtained after 6 days of iws than after 6 hours and 48 hours p values 0 05 no significant changes were observed between 6 hours and 48 hours for ttc and icc p value 0 05 3 4 microbial community structure 3 4 1 alpha diversity chao 1 simpson

water supply chao 1 for fungi in biofilm samples did not show significant differences between iws times but simpson was significant higher after 48 hours followed by 6 hours and 6 days p values 0 05 consequently shannon index presented significant lower values after 48 hours than after 6 hours or 6 days p values 0 05 planktonic bacterial communities were not affected by iws events and no significant differences were observed in any index between water samples from the 3 iws times at all the different stages of the water supply restarting p values 0 05 planktonic fungal communities did not show significant differences for chao 1 at any stage of water supply restarting between the different iws times p value 0 05 simpson and shannon indices did not show significant differences in stages 0 3 and 4 p value 0 05 during the water supply restarting but significant changes were observed for these indices in stages 1 and 2 overall fungal communities after 6 hours presented lower significant values for simpson and consequently higher significant shannon values p values 0 05 than fungal communities after 48 hours or 6 days 3 4 2 beta diversity nmds plots with the resemblance of bacteria and fungi communities at genus level in biofilm and water samples after the different iws times are shown in fig 6 for biofilm samples no clear separation of the bacterial and fungal communities was observed the anosim analysis supplementary table o confirmed that no significant differences were found for bacteria between 60 day old biofilms and after 6 hours of iws however the bacterial community structure significantly changed after 48 hours and after 6 days of iws in addition bacterial community structure showed significant differences between the different iws times for fungi in biofilm anosim supplementary table o showed significant differences between 60 day old samples and after 48 hours and 6 days of iws no significant differences were found between 60 day old

iws times analysed the anosim analysis supplementary table o confirmed that water samples from day 60 had a significant different bacterial community structure when compared with samples after all iws times significant differences were also found when bacterial communities when compared after the 3 iws times for planktonic fungal communities no clear separation between samples was observed in the nmds anosim confirmed the absence of significant differences between fungal communities of day 60 and after all iws times as well as between planktonic fungal communities after 48 hours compared to 6 hours 6 days however significant changes were observed for fungal planktonic samples after 6 hours and 6 days of iws 3 5 microbial community composition 3 5 1 taxonomic analysis of biofilm communities differences in bacterial and fungal community composition at genus level were observed between 60 days old biofilm samples post iws and biofilm samples post restarting the water supply after the different iws times fig 7 a and b fig 7 a shows the taxonomic analysis of bacteria in all biofilm samples overall 60 days old biofilm samples in the 3 loops were dominated by phreatobacter 33 5 a not defined ns taxa belonging to the order obscuribacterales 17 5 and pseudomonas 10 0 after 6 hours of iws both post iws and post restarting biofilm samples showed similar bacterial profiles to those of

supply after 6 hours the relative abundance of cadophora 66 5 increased becoming predominant in the community followed by ochroconis 10 5 after 48 hours iws and post iws the fungal community was dominated by cladosporium 23 6 cadophora 18 9 pleosporales nd 17 4 and cadophora 15 9 post restarting the water supply after 48 hours of iws the fungal community was mainly dominated by ochroconis 46 4 and penicillium 36 5 after 6 days of iws in biofilms post iws the most abundant genera were again ochroconis 24 7 cladosporium 13 8 and didymellaceae nd 19 6 post restarting the water supply after 6 days cladosporium 20 4 became the most abundant genera and other genera such as ochroconis 8 3 or debaryomyces 8 0 presented high relative abundances 3 5 2 taxonomic analysis of planktonic communities differences in bacterial and fungal composition at genus level were observed in planktonic communities when the water supply was restarted after different iws times fig 8 a and b taxonomic analysis of bacteria in water samples fig 8 a showed that on day 60 of the growth phase several genera such a reyranella phreatobacter nevskia sphingomonas methylobacterium or cupriavidus were present with average relative abundances between 12 5 and 6 9 after 6 hours and 48 hours of iws bacterial planktonic communities followed a similar pattern of change through the stages of the water supply restarting in stage 0 sphingomonas 36 6 40 8 and methylobacterium 24 6 26 1 were the most abundant genera however their relative abundance in samples from stage 1 to 4 decreased whilst phreatobacter became dominant 45 5 70 2 a notable increase in the relative abundance of mycobacterium 6 3 11 6 and the taxa belonging to the order obscuribacterales 6 3 11 3 was observed in stages 2 3 and 4 after 48 hours of iws similar results were observed after 6 days of iws in stage 0 with high relative abundance of sphingomonas 37 7 and methylobacterium 23 1 in water samples from stages 1 to 4 sphingomonas 34 1 47 6 continued to be the most abundant genus followed by nevskia 6 3 25 1 and phreatobacter 13 3 21 8 fungal planktonic composition fig 8 b did not show significant changes after the water supply was restarted for the different iws times on day 60 the most abundant planktonic fungi in samples from the 3 loops were cadophora 54 8 sordariomycetes nd 19 3 and exophiala 17 0 after the 3 iws the taxonomic profile of planktonic fungi was similar with high relative abundance of cadophora 9 7 66 7 exophiala 5 1 31 6 and cladosporium 4 1 23 9 4 discussion this research investigated the unexplored impact of iws on the combined hydrological microbiological and physico chemical characteristics of distributed drinking water with the aim of improving distribution system management the study shows a number of findings that highlight considerations for future iws operational practices primary amongst these are that microbial structural and compositional changes in biofilms occurred during iws events and those when combined with hydraulic changes impacted water quality an experimental facility simulating dwds was operated to understand the impact of iws on biofilms based on analysing changes within bulk water after imposing mobilising forces a significant increase in turbidity and inorganic fe and mn concentrations were observed after recommissioning in all 3 iws events under typical conditions mobilisation of biofilm and associated material occurs as shear forces increase with no response until the typical or conditioned state is exceeded chaves simões and simões 2013 douterelo et al 2013 husband 2016 husband et al 2008 sharpe 2010 this is easily understood as no turbidity response was seen on a daily basis during the 60 days of biofilm growth phase whereas a significant turbidity response was clearly linked to pipe wall material mobilisation on restart the restarting flow created forces that eroded material previously conditioned to the same imposed hydraulic shear stress forces from the pipe wall into the bulk flow and subsequent increases also resulted in further discolouration responses supporting validated concepts of cohesive material attachment husband et al 2016 this result indicates that changes occurred within the biofilm during iws with overall response magnitudes indicating least impact from the shortest iws event similar to these observations tokajian and hashwa 2003 found higher turbidity levels when flow was restarted in a small iws system supplied twice a week and cerrato et al 2006 observed higher acute fe and mn concentrations during iws conditions compared to the chronic concentrations found during continuous supply in pvc and iron pipes previous studies have shown that under stagnation biofilms can develop to a greater extent since they are not under hydraulic constraints chaves simões and simões 2013 coelho et al 2003 likewise observed that hpc was higher when the flow was restarted after iws events in different dwds operating from 10 12 hours per 48 hours to twice per week in different locations and kumpel and nelson 2013 reported a greater presence of total coliforms and e coli in a chlorinated dwds system performing under iws kumpel and nelson 2013 in this study higher turbidity and inorganics concentration values were observed with increased iws duration however this distinct discolouration response was not always supported by significant increases in cell counts or suva demonstrating that cell counts should not be considered linked to turbidity and different mobilisation processes between biofilm cells and entrapped material may occur it is hypothesized that longer times under the new changed environmental condition i e drained pipe could result in greater biofilm breakdown and cell death that can then be eroded along with entrapped inorganics by the imposed hydraulic shear forces two conflicting observations however are presented by the tcc results the first is that the highest tcc counts occur during the pressure change stage when no significant turbidity response was observed and the second is the decreasing tcc values observed during the subsequent stages the former does correspond to an increase in suva254 fig 3 and reinforces the hypothesis that there is not a clear correlation between cell counts and turbidity an aspect of water quality monitoring that requires further investigation the latter may be a consequence of exposure to the fresh water with higher incoming disinfectant concentrations which could also help explain the reduction in cell viability observed nescerecka et al 2014 based on the assumption that the established biofilms breakdown i e changed their structure and compactness during drain down is proportional to time for the iws durations examined here a greater cell release and higher discolouration response would be expected after 6 days than after 48 hours of iws turbidity results from stage 2 and 3 supported this for 6 to 48 hours but not for 48 hours to 144 hours suggesting material attached to the pipe walls after 144 hours of iws was more difficult to remove this increased resistance of particulate material release from biofilms after longer iws periods could be explained by the resumption of biofilm development suggested by tcc and icc results strengthening cohesive properties or potential impact of a drying process it has been demonstrated that more than 90 of the wet weight of biofilms is water and thus the absence of water can change the biofilm compactness schmitt and flemming 1999 when the biofilm dries out its internal structure can change and the forces between the cells and the surface are strengthened cerrato et al 2006 observed that biofilm morphology was affected changing its texture and colour when plastic pipes were dried in a system operating under iws this drying process can make the biofilm more compact and increases the difficulty for water to penetrate melo 2005 increasing shear strength properties and consequently higher shear stresses are required to erode them from the pipe this research highlights that many interacting factors are at work and further investigations are needed to understand the combined action of hydraulic forces and pipe microbiome properties of significance is that the large step increase in pressure and not flow during stage 1 from 2 0 to 2 9 bar did not result in a measured turbidity response it is noted that the pipe loop control algorithms were designed to prevent dynamic hydraulic conditions and avoid the shock loads associated with hydraulic transients the change in pressure for each loop took between 6 and 10 seconds far greater than the pressure wave transit time for the system around 2 seconds with no evidence of dynamic pressure transients therefore this research demonstrates that operators are not constrained by water quality risks if undertaking controlled increases in network pressure furthermore the findings highlighted material sensitivity to pipes recommissioning following a single iws event such as one off maintenance activity in networks that are normally run under continuous supply it is therefore likely that networks operated under regular iws would develop biofilms adapted to these cycling conditions and not demonstrate the sensitivity highlighted here although previous work nescerecka et al 2014 has indicated otherwise further experiments running repeating iws events could investigate both community adaptions and subsequent water quality impact and test strategies to minimise responses thereby informing future start up procedures moreover results shown here are based on 60 days old biofilm enough time to detect and monitor discolouration events and changes in microbial communities according to previous studies performed in the same experimental facility douterelo sharpe and boxall 2014 husband et al 2016 fish and boxall 2018 however disruptions in the water supply can happen periodically or for the first time after years of the pipe installation thus affecting biofilms at different maturation stages future investigations on the impact of biofilms in dwds under iws should consider conducting experiments in real networks to better understand microbial risks associated to different periods of iws factors such as pipe age and or material type of disinfection hydraulic regimes and water source can influence biofilm structure and composition douterelo sharpe and boxall 2013 gomez alvarez et al 2015 ren et al 2015 hence can affect final water quality when biofilms are mobilised into the bulk water due to iws the characteristics of nom after different iws times were analysed by determining toc doc and suva these parameters provide measurements of the concentration and type of nom present in water which can react with disinfectants and lead to the formation of harmful disinfection by products dbps matilainen et al 2011 specifically the hydrophobic humic fraction of nom is more reactive with oxidants like chlorine favouring the formation of dbps reckhow et al 1990 weishaar et al 2003 toc and doc results showed typical concentrations previously reported for drinking water douterelo et al 2014 li et al 2018 and no significant differences were observed in any stage after restarting the water supply for the different iws times however the highest suva values measured after 6 hours iws when compared to 48 hours and 144 hours indicated a higher proportion of aromatic organic compounds which can potentially react with chlorine to form dbps the change in environment conditions loss of water drying oxygen levels etc would also impact material transport processes and hence organic material uptake and or increase cell lysis the lack of an evident increased risk for dbps formation after 48 h or 144 hours iws when compared to 6 hours may be linked to insufficient time for the existing biofilm to adapt to the new conditions limiting organic uptake this change in environmental conditions will most likely have a higher impact on the outer more exposed layers of biofilms and could explain the higher suva observed after the initial increase in flow eroding these effected layers in the 6 hour iws test this is relevant as high concentrations of chlorine are commonly used post interventions in the pipe network as a protective measure against contamination that could further exacerbate dbp formation further research could investigate this phenomenon to confirm results and then investigate how quickly increased nom release occurs after draining down to indicate if a reduced operational window exists to minimise impact microbial communities in iws have undergone limited exploration using molecular methods melo 2005 this knowledge gap has been addressed here by analysing mixed microorganisms bacteria and fungi in both planktonic and biofilm communities the compositional changes observed in the microbial communities indicates that environmental changes during iws events affected biofilm communities sequencing results showed that some of bacterial phyla in biofilms enhanced by iws belonged to alpha beta and gamma proteobacteria phylum such as sphingomonas aquabacterium and pseudomonas respectively as well as gram positive bacteria like mycobacterium and non photosynthetic cyanobacteria obscuribacterales nd which have the ability to form endospores and be more resistant to stress conditions like desiccation sandle 2016 regarding planktonic bacterial communities genera like obscuribacteriales nd methylobacterium nevskia phreatobacter mycobacterium and sphingomonas increased their relative abundance after iws periods and when the water supply was restarted after iws time specially phreatobacter mycobacterium and sphingomonas similar communities were identified in both water and biofilm samples from an unchlorinated and chlorinated iws system from beirut lebanon and cali colombia respectively tokajian et al 2005 montoya pachongo et al 2018 this suggests that these genera could be specifically favoured by iws events in terms of health and water quality ercumen et al 2015 showed that iws can lead to waterborne illness and diarrheal diseases through contamination in the pipelines limiting the availability of safe water during intermittencies our findings indicated that iws times especially after longer periods of iws favour the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas mycobacterium and sphingomonas which presented high relative abundances compared to the 60 day old biofilms when the water supply was restarted pseudomonas and mycobacterium genera include species of opportunistic pathogens and its presence in drinking water have been related to nosocomial infections vaerewijck et al 2005 hilborn et al 2006 costa et al 2015 liu et al 2016 who 2017 sphingomonas is well recognized for its ability for extracellular polymeric substances eps formation thus contributing to biofilm development and some species are involved in the infection of immunocompromised patients in hospitals johnsen et al 2000 zhang et al 2012 steinberg and burd 2015 the increase of the relative abundance of these genera in biofilms after longer iws times could have important implications for public health if biofilm is mobilised into the bulk water similarly the presence of methylobacterium in water samples from this study indicates a potential risks since species belonging to this genus can cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients in hospitals due to its ability to form biofilms and to exhibit tolerance to disinfecting agents high temperatures and to drying kovaleva et al 2014 studies regarding fungi in dwds have been gaining attention due to their biofilm formation ability and their interaction with bacteria in fungal bacterial biofilms afonso et al 2020 however there are no iws studies that include the analysis of fungal communities the fungal analysis showed that these microorganisms mainly represented by the ascomycota phylum were less affected by iws events than bacterial communities an indication of the key role fungal communities may play in biofilm stability however the dominance of certain fungi such as cadophora increased with short iws times cadophora is a phytopathogenic fungus but it has not been related to human health problems travadon et al 2015 other fungi such as ochroconis and penicillium dominant in biofilm samples when the water supply was restarted can contain pathogenic species associated to local human infections lyratzopoulos et al 2002 novak babič et al 2017 therefore it can be concluded that monitoring biofilm communities is proven essential since longer iws can increase potential risks associated to pathogenic microorganisms these results provide a starting point for future research on the effects of supply disruption on the dwds microbiome more precise and efficient molecular methods such as quantitative pcr q pcr for the identification and quantification of specific microorganisms smith and osborn 2009 nolan huggett and sanchez 2013 could help to accurately determine the presence of potential pathogens observed in this study trough metagenomics analysis all this knowledge including infrastructure characteristics turbidity thresholds and associated occurrence of potential pathogens could be used to establish an effective microbial risk assessment framework to monitor and control the microbial hazards associated to iws this novel research provides a number of findings that contribute to a better understanding of dwds managed under iws the experiment was not replicated during this research because of the technical difficulties of repeating an experiment of this magnitude in terms of water energy labour and economic expenditure however to the authors knowledge this is the first experiment under controlled conditions about different iws times and their impact on biofilm mobilisation and water quality based on the findings from this research the possible approaches that can be adopted to mitigate biofilm associated risks caused by iws include routine pipe cleaning operations by for example unidirectional flushing slaats et al 2002 douterelo husband and boxall 2014 and air scouring pourcel and duchesne 2020 especially if iws events are expected 5 conclusions for the first time this study shows how different iws events impact distribution system microorganisms and biofilm mobilisation responses and thus impact on water quality from this research several key findings were highlighted short iws events 6 hours resulted in higher concentrations of aromatic organic compounds hence greater risk of potential dbp formation in chlorinated systems pressure increases had no impact on network turbidity whilst flow increases promoted material release and discolouration risk for each subsequent increase turbidity changes do not reflect mobilisation of pipe wall total or intact cell counts iws events promoted changes in structure and taxonomic profiles of dwds biofilm and planktonic communities with i greatest compositional changes observed for longer iws times ii fungal communities changed less than bacterial communities iii changes in planktonic communities observed after the different iws can be associated to biofilm mobilisation and iv relative abundance of potentially pathogenic and or detrimental microorganisms favoured in biofilm samples after iws with increasing incidence for longer iws events these include flavobacterium after 6 hours of iws ochroconis and penicillium after 48 hours of iws and mycobacterium sphingomonas ochroconis and

16894,bank filtration is a cost effective and sustainable method of improving surface water quality for drinking water production during aquifer transit natural biodegradation and physiochemical filtration improve the quality of the raw water by removing sediments pollutants and pathogens strict regulations prohibit the use of substances that can be used to estimate aquifer residence times to define water protection areas for bank filtration in this study we present a novel measurement and modeling framework for deriving mean aquifer residence times for bank filtrate using the natural tracer radon 222 the method is intended for application in the drinking water sector where extraction wells are screened over the entire aquifer and pumps are operated at high production rates mean aquifer residence times are estimated using composite residence time distributions that account for flow path mixing and non uniform residence times with multiple components including bank filtrate shallow groundwater and deep groundwater the mathematical framework is demonstrated for a drinking water production facility radon activities for the six monitored extraction wells ranged between 4 400 and 8 400 bq m³ estimated mean aquifer residence times for the wells range from 5 days to 110 days and strongly depend on i the type of residence time distribution model exponential gamma or piston flow ii the mixing ratio between bank filtrate and local groundwater and iii the heterogeneity in the groundwater endmember by accounting for mixing processes we can show that radon can be used beyond the 5 fold half life 20 days commonly described in the literature as the upper limit for age dating purposes for radon this method provides a simple and cost efficient way to quantify residence times of bank filtrate on a regular basis without any addition of external substances to the aquifer graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction bank filtration is increasingly being used as an inexpensive and sustainable method to improve the quality of surface water for drinking water production bertin and bourg 1994 tufenkji et al 2002 in particular european countries have extensively used and still use bank filtration as a method for producing drinking water as water resources of adequate quality are generally less readily available than other areas of the world due to a high population density and history of industrialization and associated contamination of water resources tufenkji et al 2002 for example in switzerland almost 80 of drinking water comes from bank filtration while bank filtration in germany total 8 is of particular importance for the drinking water supply of berlin and in the ruhr region along the spree and rhine rivers statistisches bundesamt 2016 during the production of drinking water by bank filtration surface water flows into the aquifer from a surface water body artificially induced by extracting water from one or multiple extraction wells in the proximity of the surface water source facilities that use bank filtrate for drinking water production typically operate near perennial streams lakes or reservoirs that are well hydraulically connected to an adjacent aquifer with a high hydraulic conductivity improvement of water quality of the surface water is the main objective during bank filtration where water transit through the aquifer filters sediments pathogens and particulate organic matter from the source water dash et al 2010 pathogens are removed within the aquifer due to lack of light and substrate hiscock and grischek 2002 while nutrients such as dissolved organic carbon or nitrate are consumed by microbial processes grünheid et al 2005 munz et al 2019 the time infiltrated surface water spends in the aquifer is a key parameter for the efficiency of bank filtration this can also be referred to as the aquifer residence time rt water quality protection areas near extraction wells are typically designated based on some minimum aquifer residence time a timescale deemed suitable to remove a large amount of potential contaminants from the source water in germany the protection area around extraction wells is defined as a 50 day line which is the minimum rt required until surface water reaches the production well designation and verification of water protection areas around extraction wells based on the concept of minimum aquifer rts is not trivial methods that are in common use are i numerical modeling in combination with particle tracking abdel fattah et al 2008 maxwell et al 2003 ii application of pulse experiments with a conservative tracer such as bromide or a fluorescent dye davis et al 1980 iii monitoring of electrical conductivity or temperature vogt et al 2010 or iv natural or anthropogenic tracers that ubiquitously can be found in surface and groundwater such as the tritium helium method or trace gasses such as cfc s or sulfur hexafluoride beyerle et al 1999 compared to artificially applied tracers e g bromide or fluorescent dyes where the application is often restricted in water protection areas due to contamination concerns natural tracers are elements that are naturally occurring either in surface or subsurface water and therefore are particularly suitable for application in the drinking water sector the radioactive noble gas radon 222 222rn offers compelling advantages compared to other established tracer methods due to its simple and cost efficient measurement mobile 222rn detectors are being increasingly used in groundwater surface water interaction studies including for quantification of rts in the streambed cranswick et al 2014 frei et al 2020 hofmann et al 2011 pittroff et al 2017 mobile detectors offer the possibility to measure 222rn activities in water samples with high accuracy directly in the field without the necessity of complex and expensive laboratory infrastructure and sampling procedures e g 3h 3he in comparison to tracers such as cl or δ18o where stream concentrations can be highly variable causing attenuation of the input signal to the aquifer stream 222rn activities are low and have minimal temporal variability due to high degassing rates and negligible in situ production both temperature and electrical conductivity have highly dynamic signals in streams and bank filtrate vogt et al 2010 demanding long term highly temporally resolved measurements and more elaborate evaluation methods such as analytical numerical heat transport models or methods from time series analysis e g spectral decomposition or wavelets to estimate rts vogt et al 2010 moreover both of these methods assume a dimension of flow when estimating rt which usually assumed to be 1d this is usually a significant simplification of flow fields in real groundwater surface water systems although 222rn has been used to estimate aquifer rts of bank filtrate its application is limited to a few case studies hoehn and gunten 1989 introduced the basic concept of how aquifer rts can be derived from 222rn activities and were the first to use 222rn as a quantitative tool to estimate infiltration rates of surface waters into aquifers later the 222rn method was used by bertin and bourg 1994 to estimate rts and infiltration velocities for the lot river in southwest france during bank filtration and by dehnert et al 1999 and schubert et al 2006 to quantify infiltration rates of the elbe river into an alluvial aquifer that was used for drinking water production in eastern germany more recently vogt et al 2010 close et al 2014 and popp et al 2021 used the 222rn method to quantify recharge rates to alluvial aquifers from bank filtration of river systems located in switzerland and new zealand the water quality of bank filtrate often suffers permanently or temporarily from low aquifer rts ascott et al 2016 bize et al 1981 bourg and bertin 1993 vogt et al 2010 for water suppliers it would be beneficial to be able to easily monitor and verify aquifer rts for their extraction wells especially under high flow conditions that are known to reduce aquifer rts significantly ascott et al 2016 because of its cost effectiveness high accuracy and flexibility 222rn offers a natural tracer method for the drinking water sector for estimating rts for bank filtrate in the study of hoehn and gunten 1989 the exponential ingrowth of 222rn in porous media was used to estimate subsurface rts and flow velocities of bank filtrate in the glatt river aare river and hagneck canal a fundamental assumption in the quantification of rts presented in hoehn and gunten 1989 is that the 222rn activity in the aquifer is representative for water extracted from a single flow path and that there is negligible mixing between flow paths as water flows to the well this is referred to as the single flow path assumption fig 1 a extraction wells typically are screened over their entire aquifer depth to maximize extraction volumes thus in reality water originating from various sources and from multiple flow paths are mixed in the extracted water the 222rn activity measured in an extraction well represents the weighted average activity of the various water sources weighted by the proportion of each source for a mixed activity the single flow path assumption is grossly violated and aquifer rts estimated by using the original equation of hoehn and gunten 1989 are unlikely to be correct since the first application of the 222rn method by hoehn and gunten 1989 the mathematical framework for the derivation of rts from measured 222rn activities has remained essentially unchanged exceptions are the contributions presented in lamontagne and cook 2007 and frei et al 2019 which presented derivations that can be used to mathematically describe enrichment of 222rn in hyporheic systems in contrast to the single flow path assumption enrichment of 222rn in the studies of lamontagne and cook 2007 and frei et al 2019 is represented by accounting for mixing of flow paths with non uniform rts and by incorporating the concept of rt distributions rtds application of rtds is a commonly used method in lumped parameter models to account for flow path mixing and non uniform subsurface flow characteristics in hydrological systems hrachowitz et al 2013 in catchment hydrology tritium measurements usually are evaluated by applying lumped parameter concepts in combination with assumptions of how subsurface rts are distributed e g cartwright and morgenstern 2016 małoszewski et al 1983 stewart et al 2017 however to date a conceptual and mathematical framework incorporating the idea of rtds has not been used for 222rn when quantifying bank filtration in this study we introduce a more realistic mathematical framework to estimate rts for bank filtration extraction wells using the 222rn method rather than using the single flow path assumption we explicitly account for mixing of different flow paths from multiple source components bank filtrate shallow and deep groundwater in the extraction well by using a predefined rtd of water flowing to the well the composite rtd accounts for the large range of rts in aquifer systems and how mixing of these sources and flow paths influence the mean 222rn activity in the well sample the composite rtds are used as part of a convolution approach to estimate mean aquifer rts based on measured 222rn activities with this novel approach we build on the previous work in the 222rn community that has developed high resolution field based 222rn detectors to extend current limitations in the mathematical framework for calculating rts and apply this to the practical purposes of rts in bank filtrate in the drinking water sector 2 theory 2 1 radon as a natural tracer 222rn is a radioactive noble gas in the uranium 238 decay chain with a half life of t0 5 3 81 days 222rn is produced in the subsurface by the decay of its parent isotope 226ra by alpha decay compared to groundwater surface water generally has low 222rn activities 1000 bq m ³ due to degassing to the atmosphere radioactive decay and negligible 222rn production in surface water due to very low 226ra activities when surface water infiltrates into the subsurface e g aquifers or sediments 222rn activities increase due to decay of 226ra emanation γ by neglecting hydrodynamic dispersion and in a lagrangian frame of reference 222rn activities for a water packet flowing along a subsurface flow path can be described according to eq 1 hoehn and gunten 1989 1 drn d τ γ λ rn τ here rn bq l 3 is the 222rn activityas a function of the subsurface rt τ t γ bq l 3 t 1 is the production rate of 222rn from decay of 226ra corrected by the porosity and λ t 1 is the 222rn first order decay constant λ 0 18 d 1 in eq 1 steady state conditions are reached when the rate of production equals radioactive decay which defines the 222rn activity at steady state r n e γ λ also called the endmember activity in the absence of mixing processes r n e for a water packet is reached after around τ 5 x t0 5 20 days 222rn has been used in the past as a natural tracer to estimate the rts of bank filtrate based on eq 1 bertin and bourg 1994 close et al 2014 gilfedder et al 2013 hoehn and gunten 1989 schubert et al 2006 vogt et al 2010 rts can be derived from an analytical solution to eq 1 which first was introduced by hoehn and gunten 1989 and later modified by cranswick et al 2014 and pittroff et al 2017 to include a non zero initial 222rn activity 2 τ s 1 λ l n r n e r n τ 0 r n e r n τ s in eq 2 the rt of sampled water τ s t can be estimated by knowing the 222rn endmember activity r n e bq l 3 the initial 222rn activity of infiltrating water r n τ 0 bq l 3 which is usually taken as river water and the 222rn activity of the sampled water r n τ s bq l 3 eq 2 is valid under the following assumptions 1 the emanation process is uniform in time and space in the aquifer sediments 2 mixing processes along a flow path due to mechanical dispersion and diffusion hydrodynamic dispersion is negligible and 3 r n τ s is a 222rn activity representative for a single flow path and is not an activity resulting from mixing of different flow paths with multiple rts fig 1 retrieving a water sample from a single flow path is not feasible for practical purposes especially for extraction wells that are screened over the entire depth of the aquifer and where active pumping causes convergence of flow paths and mixing of water within the well therefore assumption 3 is violated which may not be severe if a piezometer or well screen is narrow and the pumping rate low pittroff et al al lamontagne and cook 2007 pittroff et al 2017 however for estimating rts for artificially induced bank filtrate with high pumping rates and where extraction wells typically are equipped with screens extending over the entire installation depth meters to tens of meters violation of assumption 3 can be substantial 2 2 representing rts of multiple flow components by compound probability density functions for composite samples a more general approach is necessary to account for mixing of different flow paths in the extraction well aquifers are none well mixed systems with water traveling with non uniform flow velocities along different subsurface flow paths the mean groundwater rt at the extraction well depends on the history of the extracted water packets and thus has a characteristic rtd the characteristic rtd in the aquifer can be mathematically represented by a probability density function pdf t 1 all forms of pdfs have in common that the area under the pdf is equal to unity i e 0 p d f τ d τ 1 to account for mixing of water with different rts in the extraction well and by using a pdf to represent the rtd the differential equation presented in eq 1 can be re formulated according to linear time invariant system theory into a convolution equation 3 r n τ γ r n τ 0 δ τ e λ τ p d f in eq 3 the 222rn activity in the extraction well r n τ is estimated by convolving the 222rn production term γ the known initial 222rn activity r n τ 0 with i the exponential decay of 222rn e λ τ and ii the corresponding pdf in eq 3 is the convolution operator and δ τ is the dirac delta function as eq 3 generally accounts for many types of rtds it represents a more generalized solution compared to eq 2 usually bank filtrate when extracted for drinking water production mixes local groundwater shallow and or deep groundwater with newly infiltrated river water the relative fractions of the different components of the extracted water can be defined by mixing ratios 4 i 1 k f i 1 eq 4 is valid for one or more conservative mixing components such that k 1 for extraction of water from one source only groundwater or bank filtrate k 2 if extracted water originates from bank filtration and groundwater and k 3 for when the extracting well penetrates a deeper aquifer fig 2 eq 4 can be expanded in a similar fashion to account for multiple water components k 3 well water originating from different sources e g stream shallow and deep aquifers typically have very different rts compared to water from shallow and deep aquifers that tend to have rts ranging from years to centuries dreuzy and ginn 2016 bank filtrate has rts that are usually on the order of days to weeks for wells with multiple water sources different pdfs can be assigned to each of these water sources the component specific pdf subsequently can be combined into a single compound model pdfcm t 1 representing the aquifer rtd for all extracted water components the pdfcm can be derived by superposition of the component specific pdf pdfi weighted by the different mixing ratios 5 p d f c m i 1 k f i p d f i as above the integral 0 p d f c m τ d τ 1 for uniform 222rn production γ in the aquifer pdfcm can directly be used in the convolution integral eq 3 for the case of an inhomogeneous 222rn production with different emanation rates γ i the convolution must be carried out separately for each component 6 r n τ i 1 k γ i r n τ 0 δ τ e λ τ f i p d f i although the pdf for aquifer rts are seldom known a priori there exist various types of distribution models in literature that are thought to be representative for groundwater flow systems jurgens et al 2012 j w kirchner et al 2000 among the most frequently used pdfs are i the exponential model eq 7a ii the gamma model eq 7b and iii the piston flow model eq 7c each of the three models has its own characteristic shape that can be used to mathematically describe the geometry of an aquifer rtd in eq 7a c a t represents a time delay parameter which can be used to shift the entire pdf by a constant time step 7a pd f exp τ m 1 e τ a τ m 7b pd f gam τ a α 1 β α γ α e τ a β 7c pd f p flow δ τ a in eq 7a τm t is the mean rt α and β t are scaling parameters for the gamma distribution and γ α is the gamma function equation 3b δ τ a t 1 in equation 9c is the dirac delta function the exponential model is a special type of gamma distribution where eq 7c reduces to 7a when α 1 the mean rt for the gamma model is τm α x β the unique property of the piston flow model represented by the dirac delta function is that it can be used to describe a system where there is only one rt which is identical with its mean value the piston flow model has been used in the past as a direct way to easily interpret fluctuations of in stream concentrations of atmospheric tracers e g bomb pulse tritium begemann and libby 1957 dreuzy and ginn 2016 suckow 2014 the original 222rn application presented in hoehn and gunten 1989 and used by various authors since assumes that sampled water is precisely represented by the piston flow model if the dirac delta function is used in the convolution the solution to eq 4 is identical to eq 2 with one rt only the piston flow model neglects the variability of flow and transport conditions in subsurface environments where the multi scale nature of mixing from the pore scale to the scale of geologic formations results in high variability of subsurface rts dentz et al 2004 gelhar et al 1992 the exponential model eq 4 represents a rtd where the variability of subsurface rt is represented by an exponential decay function this type of rtd has traditionally been used to describe well mixed systems leray et al 2016 but also can be applied for non well mixed systems such as catchments j w kirchner et al 2000 or streambed sediments frei et al 2019 lamontagne and cook 2007 runkel 1998 assuming exponentially distributed rts for the exponential model eq 4 can be solved analytically providing an explicit solution in closed form 8 τ m 1 λ r n τ 0 r n τ s r n τ s r n e eq 8 is identical to the way lamontagne and cook 2007 and frei et al 2019 represent enrichment of 222rn in hyporheic sediments the gamma model eq 7b is among the most flexible mathematical models for representation of rtds depending on the choice of the three parameters in eq 7b α β and a the gamma model can either be used to represent i an exponential rtd α 1 a 0 stewart et al 2017 ii an exponential piston flow model α 1 a 0 jurgens et al 2012 iii a rtd mimicking a dispersion model with a maximum e g α 1 figure 3 a or iv a power type characterized by high fraction of flow paths located at very short rts and in the pdf tail e g α 1 fig 3 a although the gamma model does not have any physical interpretation it cannot be derived from a solution to the steady state transport equation various authors have concluded that this distribution is well suited for subsurface flow environments as it can accurately represent the system s response to short term and non steady tracer inputs j w kirchner et al 2000 2001 leray et al 2016 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 for the gamma model with α 1 there is no closed form analytical solution to eq 4 and the convolution must be solved numerically in the following sections all three distribution models are used to estimate mean rts for a range of scenarios where water is extracted close to a stream or river 3 application 3 1 upper limits for rt estimations the upper limit of the mean rt that can be quantified using 222rn depends on the precision of the measurement system portable field detectors can achieve a precision of about 2 10 depending on 222rn activity counting time sample size detector size and sensitivity based on 1 standard deviation 1σ of replicate analysis this defines the maximum rt that can be estimated as it determines the highest 222rn activity that can be clearly distinguished from the endmember activity using the piston flow model eq 2 this upper limit is located between 13 10 precision and 22 days 2 precision and is often referred to in the literature as 5 times the half lifetime of 222rn 3 81 days however the upper rt that can be quantified using 222rn can be quite different when the flow system and associated pdf is more complex than the piston flow model to determine how the upper quantifiable rt depends on the choice of rtd the three distribution models introduced in equations eq 7a c were used in eq 6 for this test case we only considered a single flow component k 1 where rts can be represented using a single pdf further we assumed a uniform 222rn production in the aquifer and that infiltrating stream water contains no 222rn the results are normalized to the endmember activity so that 222rn varies between zero and one upper limits for the various rtds were estimated by assuming an uncertainty of 5 1σ for the 222rn detector this means that the maximum normalized 222rn activity that is clearly distinguishable from the endmember activity is equal to 0 95 with a statistical significance of 63 for the gamma model we considered three different shape factors α 0 5 2 and 3 fig 3a for all rtds the normalized 222rn activities as a function of the mean aquifer rt were estimated with the mean rt varied within the range of 0 10 000 days normalized 222rn activities as a function of the mean rts for the different distribution models are shown in fig 3b the colored band represents the activities that are not distinguishable from the endmember activity 1 rn τ rne 0 95 the piston flow model shows the fastest increase in 222rn activities and the upper limit for rt quantification is reached after 20 days as expected the gamma models with a local maximum α 2 and 3 fig 3a have an upper detection limit of 30 and 42 days respectively the exponential and gamma model with α 0 5 are both characterized by a high fraction of short rts which leads to a slower increase in 222rn activities with rt fig 3a b the upper detection limit for the exponential model was reached after 105 days fig 3b while the gamma model gave an upper limit of 1113 days fig 3b 3 2 field application induced bank filtration aquifer rts were estimated at a bank filtrate drinking water production facility to illustrate the method introduced above the facility consists of six vertical extraction wells connected to a central pumping station fig 4 the facility produces drinking water consisting of a mixture of groundwater and bank filtrate that is extracted from a single unconfined sedimentary aquifer the specific mixing ratios between groundwater and bank filtrate for the different extraction wells are unknown but are expected to vary in the range of 0 6 0 8 defined as the total volume of bank filtrate to total volume of extracted water the aquifer from which water is extracted is characterized by glacial and post glacial deposits including glacial fluviatile gravel and alluvial deposits all extraction wells are screened over the entire thickness of the aquifer no specific information about the location of the facility the applied pumping rates or the blueprints of the wells can be provided as this information has been classified as sensitive by the operating company in summer 2020 222rn activities for all extraction wells and the nearby stream were measured using mobile rn detectors rad7 radon in air device large dome large detector model durridge professional inc each sample was stripped of ²²²rn in a closed loop with the detector for 5 min and then counted for 30 min hofmann et al 2011 pittroff et al 2017 each sample was measured at least three times mean 222rn activities for each extraction well and the associated standard deviation of each sample are shown in fig 4 measurement standard deviations varied within 5 12 of the mean values mean aquifer rts were estimated using the piston flow model the exponential model and the gamma model with a shape factor of α 3 as the gamma model with α 2 leads to very similarly shaped rtd compared to α 3 it was omitted from further evaluations the gamma model where α 0 5 resulted in a rtd with a high fraction of very short rts which we consider as unrealistic for bank filtration facilities that are designed to prevent extraction of newly infiltrated water by being located some distance from the river usually a few hundred meters and therefore was omitted mean aquifer rts were estimated by using the algorithm fslove implemented in matlab here the mean rt of each bank filtrate rtd model was systematically modified until the resulting simulated 222rn activities matched the measured values the calculation of mean aquifer rts was tested using two different cases case 1 local groundwater is in secular equilibrium with the aquifer matrix here we assumed that 222rn activities in the deeper groundwater are at secular equilibrium endmember activity which seems reasonable since the regional aquifer is expected to have rts on the order of years for case 1 the second convolution integral in eq 6 k 2 was not necessary to be evaluated explicitly as it is equal to 1 f times the measured endmember activity where f is the unknown mixing ratio to account for uncertainties in estimating the groundwater endmember activities mean aquifer rts were calculated by assuming normally distributed endmember activities with a 15 standard deviation σ based on the mean value μ for the different rtd models μ σ were used to calculate mean aquifer rts defining the modeled endmember uncertainty bands for all extraction wells aquifer rts were evaluated using a range of mixing ratios f ϵ 0 5 1 case 2 the local groundwater is in disequilibrium with the aquifer material here the activity flow paths associated with the groundwater component have not reached secular equilibrium in contrast to case 1 both bank filtrate and groundwater are represented by different rtd models in eq 6 both components were represented by gamma type distribution models with a shape factor of α 3 by systematically increasing the shifting parameter a in the range of a ϵ 0 20 days as part of eq 6 the dependency between the mean aquifer rts of bank filtrate and the age of the groundwater component could be investigated the mean aquifer rt for the original unshifted a 0 groundwater rtd model was set to 15 days and simulations where carried out by using the mean value μ of the assumed normally distributed endmember activities case 1 groundwater in secular equilibrium for the well transect w1 w6 fig 4 measured 222rn activities systematically increased with exception of w2 from 4480 to 8340 bq m³ the activity of the river was 270 bq m³ unfortunately no suitable observation well outside of the extraction area was available for estimating the 222rn endmember activity of the aquifer therefore we used the highest measured 222rn activity of 8340 bq m³ w6 as the mean value for the assumed normally distributed endmember activities to determine the 222rn production rate within the aquifer using this value leads to a conservative estimate of the mean rt as it may also include a small amount of river water and thus it is potentially lower than the real aquifer 222rn endmember activity according to the water production company the yield of extraction well w6 at the time of sampling was low due to the filter screen being partly clogged and so subsurface flow velocities in the capture zone of extraction well w6 were expected to be lower than the other more efficiently operating extraction wells w1 w5 mean aquifer rts estimated for the five extraction wells w1 w5 depended i on the choice of the rtd model ii the selected mixing ratios as well as iii the uncertainty of the endmember activity fig 5 for a given 222rn activity the piston flow model consistently resulted in the lowest mean aquifer rt followed by the gamma and exponential model fig 5 for extraction wells with the lowest measured 222rn activities w1 and w2 application of lower mixing ratios fi 0 5 0 7 resulted in similar mean aquifer rts for all three rtd models fig 5 for the extraction wells w3 w5 the difference in mean aquifer rts was also smallest for lower mixing ratios but in contrast to w1 and w2 the difference was significant for lower mixing ratios estimated mean aquifer rts are primarily determined by the groundwater endmember activity and to a lesser extent by the different shapes of the rtd models for bank filtrate for the three rtd models higher mixing ratios resulted in a large variation in mean aquifer rts especially for extraction wells where the measured 222rn activity lay close to the endmember activity w4 and w5 the highest mean rts were calculated for w5 the extraction well with a 222rn activity of 8000 bq m³ which is close to the endmember activity for w5 the upper quantification limit for the different rtd models were exceeded for high mixing ratios 0 9 1 at 42 days for the gamma and 105 days for the exponential model mean aquifer rts were also highly affected by the assumed endmember uncertainty color bands shown in fig 5 differences in mean aquifer rt estimated for the lower μ σ and upper limit μ σ of the endmember uncertainty bands for all rtd models are increasing with mixing ratios for a given mixing ratio especially the exponential model showed the highest differences in mean aquifer rts followed by the gamma and piston flow model mean rts estimated for extractions wells with high 222rn activities w3 w5 were more affected by the endmember uncertainty compared to wells with low 222rn activities as the mixing ratios from the field site are thought to range between 0 6 and 0 8 mean aquifer rts derived for this range are considered to best represent reality further among the three different rtds we believe that the gamma model with its local maximum for intermediate rts fig 3a best represents the flow field during bank filtration in contrast the piston flow model assumes that all sampled water packets only have one rt and neglects that infiltrated stream flows along various flow paths and with non uniform flow velocities within the aquifer thus it is likely that this model leads to unrealistically short estimates for the bank filtrate component although the exponential model does account for the distribution of flow paths in the subsurface and thus multiple aquifer rts this rtd model assumes a disproportionately high fraction of low rt flow paths which is unlikely to reflect the real conditions during induced bank filtration due to the distance of the wells from the river moreover facilities that produce drinking water with the induced bank filtration technique are designed to ensure a sufficient rt within the aquifer to improve water quality this is typically achieved by maintaining a certain distance and thus travel time between the stream and extraction well e g 50 day line as the mean aquifer rts are strongly influenced by the 222rn production rates in the aquifer uncertainties in estimating endmember activities substantially affect the precision of the applied method highlighting i the necessity for a reliable method to estimate endmember activities and b that uncertainties in estimating 222rn production rates need to be explicitly accounted for in the presented approach in the calculations presented here aquifer rts were estimated by assuming a homogenous endmember activity in the alluvial aquifer previous studies however showed that the assumption of macroscopic homogeneity is not always met especially for alluvial sediments with non uniform mineralogy and grain size distributions resulting in spatially heterogeneous 222rn emanation rates schubert et al 2006 case 2 groundwater in disequilibrium mean aquifer rts for bank filtrate from w3 ranged between 0 5 days for low mixing ratios and up to 7 2 days for a mixing ratio of f 1 fig 6 for a constant mixing ratio an increase of the shifting parameter resulted in a decrease of the mean aquifer rts for the bank filtrate component fig 6 for shifting parameters a 0 10 and 20 days and a mixing ratio of f 0 7 the gamma type models for bank filtrate and groundwater are shown in fig 7 the gray shaded rtds in fig 7 are the compound rtds the unshifted groundwater rtd model fig 7a overlaps over a wide range of rts with the bank filtrate model this overlap leads to a compound rtd which is characterized by a lower maximum and a more pronounced tail compared to the rtd of the bank filtrate component the rtd for the groundwater in fig 7a represents a situation where extracted groundwater has not entirely reached the secular equilibrium resulting in a groundwater 222rn activity that is lower than the endmember activity by increasing a to 10 days the overlapping area between rtds for bank filtrate and groundwater becomes smaller and the resulting compound rtd is characterized by a secondary maximum fig 7b the increase in groundwater rts from a 0 to 10 days resulted in a reduction of the mean rts for the bank filtrate component from 5 6 to 4 7 days according to the linear mixing model for a measured 222 rn activity of 5610 bq m³ w2 the activity for the bank filtrate component must be reduced to compensate for the higher groundwater activity as the shifting parameter is increased if the shifting parameter is further increased to a 20 days all flow paths represented by the groundwater rtd have rts 20 days fig 7c and the 222rn in the groundwater is at secular equilibrium here the groundwater 222rn activity cannot be distinguished from the endmember activity and a further increase of the shifting parameter would not affect the mean rts of the bank filtrate component 4 summary and conclusions the rts of bank filtrate in aquifers is often directly linked to chemical and biological reactions and thus significantly influences drinking water quality short aquifer rts during bank filtration can result in drinking water with bacterial contamination high nutrient loadings significant organic micropollutant concentrations and poor taste tufenkji et al 2002 for water suppliers using bank filtration knowledge of aquifer rts and how it changes with river discharge and pumping rates is essential to designate water protection areas and to assess the risk of contamination during hydrological events such as flooding it is also important for validating models of the extraction area for large scale use in the drinking water sector a reliable and simple method is preferable which can be operated with minimal investment portable 222rn detectors have become available that can measure 222rn activities with high precision directly in the field and without the considerable laboratory infrastructure needed for liquid scintillation counting in this study we present a further development of the mathematical framework used for estimating rts from measured 222rn activities in pumping wells the approach is specifically intended to estimate aquifer rts for fully screened extraction wells where mixing of different sources and flow paths is important by neglecting mixing as done in previous work estimated aquifer rts are error prone and tend to be underestimated as they are based on highly simplified assumptions of the flow field we also show that 222rn can be used for age dating purposes beyond the 5 x half life limit of the standard model by using composite rtd models rather than an upper limit of 13 22 days depending on the precision of the detector the detection limit depends on the choice of rtd model in this context the presented approach represents a more general solution to what was used previously in literature and can be applied to more complex flow fields resulting in more realistic rt estimates the application presented as part of this study is based on a rather limited dataset the accuracy of the models presented in this work would benefit from estimating rts on a regular basis once a detector is available weekly or monthly 222rn measurements from extraction wells are inexpensive and easy to perform such data could be used to understand how pumping rates and different hydrologic conditions affect mean rts of the bank filtrate component combining the presented method with other tracer techniques e g 35so4 2 sulfur hexafluoride gadolinium stable isotopes of water or major ions would help to narrow down existing uncertainties such as filtrate groundwater mixing ratios and rtd characteristics often water suppliers are required by law to monitor water quality of infiltrating stream reaches and extracted water for contaminants e g heavy metals pharmaceuticals pesticides this data can also be used in combination with 222rn to estimate unknown system properties such as mixing ratios and check the plausibility of 222rn based modeling multiple groundwater monitoring wells located near the extraction site but not close enough to be directly affected by groundwater drawdown would provide the advantage of obtaining independent samples for endmember activities and to assess associated uncertainties that highly affect estimates for mean aquifer rts the assumption of a homogeneous endmember activity and a truly representative sample of this endmember is still problematic when using 222rn as a tracer for aquifer rts in our example we were unable to retrieve a water sample from the aquifer that could be unequivocally used as a unique endmember due to the physical setting of the well field and available sampling wells it is even questionable whether a single endmember activity even exists for alluvial aquifers as it is known that 222rn production can be heterogeneously distributed on small spatial scales cartwright and hofmann 2015 cecil and green 2000 for situations where reliable endmember activities cannot be obtained directly from extraction wells incubation experiments with aquifer material represent an alternative method of both obtaining an endmember value and quantifying a distribution of possible endmembers within the aquifer bourke et al 2014 preferably incubation experiments are carried out directly after drilling a pumping well where fresh aquifer material is available application of rtd as part of lumped parameter models assume that subsurface flow conditions in the aquifer are at steady state meaning that the rtd is a time invariant system characteristic for dynamic hydrological conditions such as flooding and or intensive rainstorms where the river stage is highly variable the assumption of a time invariant rtd is unrealistic for such conditions the model presented above would most likely be error prone reliable estimates for mean aquifer rts are best achieved during relative stable periods such as during baseflow or conditions with only low to moderate rainfall for flooding events continuous 222rn observations in extraction wells gilfedder et al 2013 could serve as an early warning system to indicate when short rt flood water is influencing the production wells this would be seen by rapidly falling 222rn activities in well water activity despite the assumptions and limitations of the method presented here we believe that 222rn has a high potential for application in the drinking water sector to monitor aquifer rts during bank filtration and thus assist in management of drinking water resources declaration of competing interest the

16894,bank filtration is a cost effective and sustainable method of improving surface water quality for drinking water production during aquifer transit natural biodegradation and physiochemical filtration improve the quality of the raw water by removing sediments pollutants and pathogens strict regulations prohibit the use of substances that can be used to estimate aquifer residence times to define water protection areas for bank filtration in this study we present a novel measurement and modeling framework for deriving mean aquifer residence times for bank filtrate using the natural tracer radon 222 the method is intended for application in the drinking water sector where extraction wells are screened over the entire aquifer and pumps are operated at high production rates mean aquifer residence times are estimated using composite residence time distributions that account for flow path mixing and non uniform residence times with multiple components including bank filtrate shallow groundwater and deep groundwater the mathematical framework is demonstrated for a drinking water production facility radon activities for the six monitored extraction wells ranged between 4 400 and 8 400 bq m³ estimated mean aquifer residence times for the wells range from 5 days to 110 days and strongly depend on i the type of residence time distribution model exponential gamma or piston flow ii the mixing ratio between bank filtrate and local groundwater and iii the heterogeneity in the groundwater endmember by accounting for mixing processes we can show that radon can be used beyond the 5 fold half life 20 days commonly described in the literature as the upper limit for age dating purposes for radon this method provides a simple and cost efficient way to quantify residence times of bank filtrate on a regular basis without any addition of external substances to the aquifer graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction bank filtration is increasingly being used as an inexpensive and sustainable method to improve the quality of surface water for drinking water production bertin and bourg 1994 tufenkji et al 2002 in particular european countries have extensively used and still use bank filtration as a method for producing drinking water as water resources of adequate quality are generally less readily available than other areas of the world due to a high population density and history of industrialization and associated contamination of water resources tufenkji et al 2002 for example in switzerland almost 80 of drinking water comes from bank filtration while bank filtration in germany total 8 is of particular importance for the drinking water supply of berlin and in the ruhr region along the spree and rhine rivers statistisches bundesamt 2016 during the production of drinking water by bank filtration surface water flows into the aquifer from a surface water body artificially induced by extracting water from one or multiple extraction wells in the proximity of the surface water source facilities that use bank filtrate for drinking water production typically operate near perennial streams lakes or reservoirs that are well hydraulically connected to an adjacent aquifer with a high hydraulic conductivity improvement of water quality of the surface water is the main objective during bank filtration where water transit through the aquifer filters sediments pathogens and particulate organic matter from the source water dash et al 2010 pathogens are removed within the aquifer due to lack of light and substrate hiscock and grischek 2002 while nutrients such as dissolved organic carbon or nitrate are consumed by microbial processes grünheid et al 2005 munz et al 2019 the time infiltrated surface water spends in the aquifer is a key parameter for the efficiency of bank filtration this can also be referred to as the aquifer residence time rt water quality protection areas near extraction wells are typically designated based on some minimum aquifer residence time a timescale deemed suitable to remove a large amount of potential contaminants from the source water in germany the protection area around extraction wells is defined as a 50 day line which is the minimum rt required until surface water reaches the production well designation and verification of water protection areas around extraction wells based on the concept of minimum aquifer rts is not trivial methods that are in common use are i numerical modeling in combination with particle tracking abdel fattah et al 2008 maxwell et al 2003 ii application of pulse experiments with a conservative tracer such as bromide or a fluorescent dye davis et al 1980 iii monitoring of electrical conductivity or temperature vogt et al 2010 or iv natural or anthropogenic tracers that ubiquitously can be found in surface and groundwater such as the tritium helium method or trace gasses such as cfc s or sulfur hexafluoride beyerle et al 1999 compared to artificially applied tracers e g bromide or fluorescent dyes where the application is often restricted in water protection areas due to contamination concerns natural tracers are elements that are naturally occurring either in surface or subsurface water and therefore are particularly suitable for application in the drinking water sector the radioactive noble gas radon 222 222rn offers compelling advantages compared to other established tracer methods due to its simple and cost efficient measurement mobile 222rn detectors are being increasingly used in groundwater surface water interaction studies including for quantification of rts in the streambed cranswick et al 2014 frei et al 2020 hofmann et al 2011 pittroff et al 2017 mobile detectors offer the possibility to measure 222rn activities in water samples with high accuracy directly in the field without the necessity of complex and expensive laboratory infrastructure and sampling procedures e g 3h 3he in comparison to tracers such as cl or δ18o where stream concentrations can be highly variable causing attenuation of the input signal to the aquifer stream 222rn activities are low and have minimal temporal variability due to high degassing rates and negligible in situ production both temperature and electrical conductivity have highly dynamic signals in streams and bank filtrate vogt et al 2010 demanding long term highly temporally resolved measurements and more elaborate evaluation methods such as analytical numerical heat transport models or methods from time series analysis e g spectral decomposition or wavelets to estimate rts vogt et al 2010 moreover both of these methods assume a dimension of flow when estimating rt which usually assumed to be 1d this is usually a significant simplification of flow fields in real groundwater surface water systems although 222rn has been used to estimate aquifer rts of bank filtrate its application is limited to a few case studies hoehn and gunten 1989 introduced the basic concept of how aquifer rts can be derived from 222rn activities and were the first to use 222rn as a quantitative tool to estimate infiltration rates of surface waters into aquifers later the 222rn method was used by bertin and bourg 1994 to estimate rts and infiltration velocities for the lot river in southwest france during bank filtration and by dehnert et al 1999 and schubert et al 2006 to quantify infiltration rates of the elbe river into an alluvial aquifer that was used for drinking water production in eastern germany more recently vogt et al 2010 close et al 2014 and popp et al 2021 used the 222rn method to quantify recharge rates to alluvial aquifers from bank filtration of river systems located in switzerland and new zealand the water quality of bank filtrate often suffers permanently or temporarily from low aquifer rts ascott et al 2016 bize et al 1981 bourg and bertin 1993 vogt et al 2010 for water suppliers it would be beneficial to be able to easily monitor and verify aquifer rts for their extraction wells especially under high flow conditions that are known to reduce aquifer rts significantly ascott et al 2016 because of its cost effectiveness high accuracy and flexibility 222rn offers a natural tracer method for the drinking water sector for estimating rts for bank filtrate in the study of hoehn and gunten 1989 the exponential ingrowth of 222rn in porous media was used to estimate subsurface rts and flow velocities of bank filtrate in the glatt river aare river and hagneck canal a fundamental assumption in the quantification of rts presented in hoehn and gunten 1989 is that the 222rn activity in the aquifer is representative for water extracted from a single flow path and that there is negligible mixing between flow paths as water flows to the well this is referred to as the single flow path assumption fig 1 a extraction wells typically are screened over their entire aquifer depth to maximize extraction volumes thus in reality water originating from various sources and from multiple flow paths are mixed in the extracted water the 222rn activity measured in an extraction well represents the weighted average activity of the various water sources weighted by the proportion of each source for a mixed activity the single flow path assumption is grossly violated and aquifer rts estimated by using the original equation of hoehn and gunten 1989 are unlikely to be correct since the first application of the 222rn method by hoehn and gunten 1989 the mathematical framework for the derivation of rts from measured 222rn activities has remained essentially unchanged exceptions are the contributions presented in lamontagne and cook 2007 and frei et al 2019 which presented derivations that can be used to mathematically describe enrichment of 222rn in hyporheic systems in contrast to the single flow path assumption enrichment of 222rn in the studies of lamontagne and cook 2007 and frei et al 2019 is represented by accounting for mixing of flow paths with non uniform rts and by incorporating the concept of rt distributions rtds application of rtds is a commonly used method in lumped parameter models to account for flow path mixing and non uniform subsurface flow characteristics in hydrological systems hrachowitz et al 2013 in catchment hydrology tritium measurements usually are evaluated by applying lumped parameter concepts in combination with assumptions of how subsurface rts are distributed e g cartwright and morgenstern 2016 małoszewski et al 1983 stewart et al 2017 however to date a conceptual and mathematical framework incorporating the idea of rtds has not been used for 222rn when quantifying bank filtration in this study we introduce a more realistic mathematical framework to estimate rts for bank filtration extraction wells using the 222rn method rather than using the single flow path assumption we explicitly account for mixing of different flow paths from multiple source components bank filtrate shallow and deep groundwater in the extraction well by using a predefined rtd of water flowing to the well the composite rtd accounts for the large range of rts in aquifer systems and how mixing of these sources and flow paths influence the mean 222rn activity in the well sample the composite rtds are used as part of a convolution approach to estimate mean aquifer rts based on measured 222rn activities with this novel approach we build on the previous work in the 222rn community that has developed high resolution field based 222rn detectors to extend current limitations in the mathematical framework for calculating rts and apply this to the practical purposes of rts in bank filtrate in the drinking water sector 2 theory 2 1 radon as a natural tracer 222rn is a radioactive noble gas in the uranium 238 decay chain with a half life of t0 5 3 81 days 222rn is produced in the subsurface by the decay of its parent isotope 226ra by alpha decay compared to groundwater surface water generally has low 222rn activities 1000 bq m ³ due to degassing to the atmosphere radioactive decay and negligible 222rn production in surface water due to very low 226ra activities when surface water infiltrates into the subsurface e g aquifers or sediments 222rn activities increase due to decay of 226ra emanation γ by neglecting hydrodynamic dispersion and in a lagrangian frame of reference 222rn activities for a water packet flowing along a subsurface flow path can be described according to eq 1 hoehn and gunten 1989 1 drn d τ γ λ rn τ here rn bq l 3 is the 222rn activityas a function of the subsurface rt τ t γ bq l 3 t 1 is the production rate of 222rn from decay of 226ra corrected by the porosity and λ t 1 is the 222rn first order decay constant λ 0 18 d 1 in eq 1 steady state conditions are reached when the rate of production equals radioactive decay which defines the 222rn activity at steady state r n e γ λ also called the endmember activity in the absence of mixing processes r n e for a water packet is reached after around τ 5 x t0 5 20 days 222rn has been used in the past as a natural tracer to estimate the rts of bank filtrate based on eq 1 bertin and bourg 1994 close et al 2014 gilfedder et al 2013 hoehn and gunten 1989 schubert et al 2006 vogt et al 2010 rts can be derived from an analytical solution to eq 1 which first was introduced by hoehn and gunten 1989 and later modified by cranswick et al 2014 and pittroff et al 2017 to include a non zero initial 222rn activity 2 τ s 1 λ l n r n e r n τ 0 r n e r n τ s in eq 2 the rt of sampled water τ s t can be estimated by knowing the 222rn endmember activity r n e bq l 3 the initial 222rn activity of infiltrating water r n τ 0 bq l 3 which is usually taken as river water and the 222rn activity of the sampled water r n τ s bq l 3 eq 2 is valid under the following assumptions 1 the emanation process is uniform in time and space in the aquifer sediments 2 mixing processes along a flow path due to mechanical dispersion and diffusion hydrodynamic dispersion is negligible and 3 r n τ s is a 222rn activity representative for a single flow path and is not an activity resulting from mixing of different flow paths with multiple rts fig 1 retrieving a water sample from a single flow path is not feasible for practical purposes especially for extraction wells that are screened over the entire depth of the aquifer and where active pumping causes convergence of flow paths and mixing of water within the well therefore assumption 3 is violated which may not be severe if a piezometer or well screen is narrow and the pumping rate low pittroff et al al lamontagne and cook 2007 pittroff et al 2017 however for estimating rts for artificially induced bank filtrate with high pumping rates and where extraction wells typically are equipped with screens extending over the entire installation depth meters to tens of meters violation of assumption 3 can be substantial 2 2 representing rts of multiple flow components by compound probability density functions for composite samples a more general approach is necessary to account for mixing of different flow paths in the extraction well aquifers are none well mixed systems with water traveling with non uniform flow velocities along different subsurface flow paths the mean groundwater rt at the extraction well depends on the history of the extracted water packets and thus has a characteristic rtd the characteristic rtd in the aquifer can be mathematically represented by a probability density function pdf t 1 all forms of pdfs have in common that the area under the pdf is equal to unity i e 0 p d f τ d τ 1 to account for mixing of water with different rts in the extraction well and by using a pdf to represent the rtd the differential equation presented in eq 1 can be re formulated according to linear time invariant system theory into a convolution equation 3 r n τ γ r n τ 0 δ τ e λ τ p d f in eq 3 the 222rn activity in the extraction well r n τ is estimated by convolving the 222rn production term γ the known initial 222rn activity r n τ 0 with i the exponential decay of 222rn e λ τ and ii the corresponding pdf in eq 3 is the convolution operator and δ τ is the dirac delta function as eq 3 generally accounts for many types of rtds it represents a more generalized solution compared to eq 2 usually bank filtrate when extracted for drinking water production mixes local groundwater shallow and or deep groundwater with newly infiltrated river water the relative fractions of the different components of the extracted water can be defined by mixing ratios 4 i 1 k f i 1 eq 4 is valid for one or more conservative mixing components such that k 1 for extraction of water from one source only groundwater or bank filtrate k 2 if extracted water originates from bank filtration and groundwater and k 3 for when the extracting well penetrates a deeper aquifer fig 2 eq 4 can be expanded in a similar fashion to account for multiple water components k 3 well water originating from different sources e g stream shallow and deep aquifers typically have very different rts compared to water from shallow and deep aquifers that tend to have rts ranging from years to centuries dreuzy and ginn 2016 bank filtrate has rts that are usually on the order of days to weeks for wells with multiple water sources different pdfs can be assigned to each of these water sources the component specific pdf subsequently can be combined into a single compound model pdfcm t 1 representing the aquifer rtd for all extracted water components the pdfcm can be derived by superposition of the component specific pdf pdfi weighted by the different mixing ratios 5 p d f c m i 1 k f i p d f i as above the integral 0 p d f c m τ d τ 1 for uniform 222rn production γ in the aquifer pdfcm can directly be used in the convolution integral eq 3 for the case of an inhomogeneous 222rn production with different emanation rates γ i the convolution must be carried out separately for each component 6 r n τ i 1 k γ i r n τ 0 δ τ e λ τ f i p d f i although the pdf for aquifer rts are seldom known a priori there exist various types of distribution models in literature that are thought to be representative for groundwater flow systems

rt for the gamma model is τm α x β the unique property of the piston flow model represented by the dirac delta function is that it can be used to describe a system where there is only one rt which is identical with its mean value the piston flow model has been used in the past as a direct way to easily interpret fluctuations of in stream concentrations of atmospheric tracers e g bomb pulse tritium begemann and libby 1957 dreuzy and ginn 2016 suckow 2014 the original 222rn application presented in hoehn and gunten 1989 and used by various authors since assumes that sampled water is precisely represented by the piston flow model if the dirac delta function is used in the convolution the solution to eq 4 is identical to eq 2 with one rt only the piston flow model neglects the variability of flow and transport conditions in subsurface environments where the multi scale nature of mixing from the pore scale to the scale of geologic formations results in high variability of subsurface rts dentz et al 2004 gelhar et al 1992 the exponential model eq 4 represents a rtd where the variability of subsurface rt is represented by an exponential decay function this type of rtd has traditionally been used to describe well mixed systems leray et al 2016 but also can be applied for non well mixed systems such as catchments j w kirchner et al 2000 or streambed sediments frei et al 2019

be solved numerically in the following sections all three distribution models are used to estimate mean rts for a range of scenarios where water is extracted close to a stream or river 3 application 3 1 upper limits for rt estimations the upper limit of the mean rt that can be quantified using 222rn depends on the precision of the measurement system portable field detectors can achieve a precision of about 2 10 depending on 222rn activity counting time sample size detector size and sensitivity based on 1 standard deviation 1σ of replicate analysis this defines the maximum rt that can be estimated as it determines the highest 222rn activity that can be clearly distinguished from the endmember activity using the piston flow model eq 2 this upper limit is located between 13 10 precision and 22 days 2 precision and is often referred to in the literature as 5 times the half lifetime of 222rn 3 81 days however the upper rt that can be quantified using 222rn can be quite different when the flow system and associated pdf is more complex than the piston flow model to determine how the upper quantifiable rt depends on the choice of rtd the three distribution models introduced in equations eq 7a c were used in eq 6 for this test case we only considered a single flow component k 1 where rts can be represented using a single pdf further we assumed a uniform 222rn production in the aquifer and that infiltrating stream water contains no 222rn the results are normalized to the endmember activity so that 222rn varies between zero and one upper limits for the various rtds were estimated by assuming an uncertainty of 5 1σ for the 222rn detector this means that the maximum normalized 222rn activity that is clearly distinguishable from the endmember activity is equal to 0 95 with a statistical significance of 63 for the gamma model we considered three different shape factors α 0 5 2 and 3 fig 3a for all rtds the normalized 222rn activities as a function of the mean aquifer rt were estimated with the mean rt varied within the range of 0 10 000 days normalized 222rn activities as a function of the mean rts for the different distribution models are shown in fig 3b the colored band represents the activities that are not distinguishable from the endmember activity 1 rn τ rne 0 95 the piston flow model shows the fastest increase in 222rn activities and the upper limit for rt quantification is reached after 20 days as expected the gamma models with a local maximum α 2 and 3 fig 3a have an upper detection limit of 30 and 42 days respectively the exponential and gamma model with α 0 5 are both characterized by a high fraction of short rts which leads to a slower increase in 222rn activities with rt fig 3a b the upper detection limit for the exponential model was reached after 105 days fig 3b while the gamma model gave an upper limit of 1113 days fig 3b 3 2 field application induced bank filtration aquifer rts were estimated at a bank filtrate drinking water production facility to illustrate the method introduced above the facility consists of six vertical extraction wells connected to a central pumping station fig 4 the facility produces drinking water consisting of a mixture of groundwater and bank filtrate that is extracted from a single unconfined sedimentary aquifer the specific mixing ratios between groundwater and bank filtrate for the different extraction wells are unknown but are expected to vary in the range of 0 6 0 8 defined as the total volume of bank filtrate to total volume of extracted water the aquifer from which water is extracted is characterized by glacial and post glacial deposits including glacial fluviatile gravel and alluvial deposits all extraction wells are screened over the entire thickness of the aquifer no specific information about the location of the facility the applied pumping rates or the blueprints of the wells can be provided as this information has been classified as sensitive by the operating company in summer 2020 222rn activities for all extraction wells and the nearby stream were measured using mobile rn detectors rad7 radon in air device large dome large detector model durridge professional inc each sample was stripped of ²²²rn in a closed loop with the detector for 5 min and then counted for 30 min hofmann et al 2011 pittroff et al 2017 each sample was measured at least three times mean 222rn activities for each extraction well and the associated standard deviation of each sample are shown in fig 4 measurement standard deviations varied within 5 12 of the mean values mean aquifer rts were estimated using the piston flow model the exponential model and the gamma model with a shape factor of α 3 as the gamma model with α 2 leads to very similarly shaped rtd compared to α 3 it was omitted from further evaluations the gamma model where α 0 5 resulted in a rtd with a high fraction of very short rts which we consider as unrealistic for bank filtration facilities that are designed to prevent extraction of newly infiltrated water by being located some distance from the river usually a few hundred meters and therefore was omitted mean aquifer rts were estimated by using the algorithm fslove implemented in matlab here the mean rt of each bank filtrate rtd model was systematically modified until the resulting simulated 222rn activities matched the measured values the calculation of mean aquifer rts was tested using two different cases case 1 local groundwater is in secular equilibrium with the aquifer matrix here we assumed that 222rn activities in the deeper groundwater are at secular equilibrium endmember activity which seems reasonable since the regional aquifer is expected to have rts on the order of years for case 1 the second convolution integral in eq 6 k 2 was not necessary to be evaluated explicitly as it is equal to 1 f times the measured endmember activity where f is the unknown mixing ratio to account for uncertainties in estimating the groundwater endmember activities mean aquifer rts were calculated by assuming normally distributed endmember activities with a 15 standard deviation σ based on the mean value μ for the different rtd models μ σ were used to calculate mean aquifer rts defining the modeled endmember uncertainty bands for all extraction wells aquifer rts were evaluated using a range of mixing ratios f ϵ 0 5 1 case 2 the local groundwater is in disequilibrium with the aquifer material here the activity flow paths associated with the groundwater component have not reached secular equilibrium in contrast to case 1 both bank filtrate and groundwater are represented by different rtd models in eq 6 both components were represented by gamma type distribution models with a shape factor of α 3 by systematically increasing the shifting parameter a in the range of a ϵ 0 20 days as part of eq 6 the dependency between the mean aquifer rts of bank filtrate and the age of the groundwater component could be investigated the mean aquifer rt for the original unshifted a 0 groundwater rtd model was set to 15 days and simulations where carried out by using the mean value μ of the assumed normally distributed endmember activities case 1 groundwater in secular equilibrium for the well transect w1 w6 fig 4 measured 222rn activities systematically increased with exception of w2 from 4480 to 8340 bq m³ the activity of the river was 270 bq m³ unfortunately no suitable observation well outside of the extraction area was available for estimating the 222rn endmember activity of the aquifer therefore we used the highest measured 222rn activity of 8340 bq m³ w6 as the mean value for the assumed normally distributed endmember activities to determine the 222rn production rate within the aquifer using this value leads to a conservative estimate of the mean rt as it may also include a small amount of river water and thus it is potentially lower than the real aquifer 222rn endmember activity according to the water production company the yield of extraction well w6 at the time of sampling was low due to the filter screen being partly clogged and so subsurface flow velocities in the capture zone of extraction well w6 were expected to be lower than the other more efficiently operating extraction wells w1 w5 mean aquifer rts estimated for the five extraction wells w1 w5 depended i on the choice of the rtd model ii the selected mixing ratios as well as iii the uncertainty of the endmember activity fig 5 for a given 222rn activity the piston flow model consistently resulted in the lowest mean aquifer rt followed by the gamma and exponential model fig 5 for extraction wells with the lowest measured 222rn activities w1 and w2 application of lower mixing ratios fi 0 5 0 7 resulted in similar mean aquifer rts for all three rtd models fig 5 for the extraction wells w3 w5 the difference in mean aquifer rts was also smallest for lower mixing ratios but in contrast to w1 and w2 the difference was significant for lower mixing ratios estimated mean aquifer rts are primarily determined by the groundwater endmember activity and to a lesser extent by the different shapes of the rtd models for bank filtrate for the three rtd models higher mixing ratios resulted in a large variation in mean aquifer rts especially for extraction wells where the measured 222rn activity lay close to the endmember activity w4 and w5 the highest mean rts were calculated for w5 the extraction well with a 222rn activity of 8000 bq m³ which is close to the endmember activity for w5 the upper quantification limit for the different rtd models were exceeded for high mixing ratios 0 9 1 at 42 days for the gamma and 105 days for the exponential model mean aquifer rts were also highly affected by the assumed endmember uncertainty color bands shown in fig 5 differences in mean aquifer rt estimated for the lower μ σ and upper limit μ σ of the endmember uncertainty bands for all rtd models are increasing with mixing ratios for a given mixing ratio especially the exponential model showed the highest differences in mean aquifer rts followed by the gamma and piston flow model mean rts estimated for extractions wells with high 222rn activities w3 w5 were more affected by the endmember uncertainty compared to wells with low 222rn activities as the mixing ratios from the field site are thought to range between 0 6 and 0 8 mean aquifer rts derived for this range are considered to best represent reality further among the three different rtds we believe that the gamma model with its local maximum for intermediate rts fig 3a best represents the flow field during bank filtration in contrast the piston flow model assumes that all sampled water packets only have one rt and neglects that infiltrated stream flows along various flow paths and with non uniform flow velocities within the aquifer thus it is likely that this model leads to unrealistically short estimates for the bank filtrate component although the exponential model does account for the distribution of flow paths in the subsurface and thus multiple aquifer rts this rtd model assumes a disproportionately high fraction of low rt flow paths which is unlikely to reflect the real conditions during induced bank filtration due to the distance of the wells from the river moreover facilities that produce drinking water with the induced bank filtration technique are designed to ensure a sufficient rt within the aquifer to improve water quality this is typically achieved by maintaining a certain distance and thus travel time between the stream and extraction well e g 50 day line as the mean aquifer rts are strongly influenced by the 222rn production rates in the aquifer uncertainties in estimating endmember activities substantially affect the precision of the applied method highlighting i the necessity for a reliable method to estimate endmember activities and b that uncertainties in estimating 222rn production rates need to be explicitly accounted for in the presented approach in the calculations presented here aquifer rts were estimated by assuming a homogenous endmember activity in the alluvial aquifer previous studies however showed that the assumption of macroscopic homogeneity is not always met especially for alluvial sediments with non uniform mineralogy and grain size distributions resulting in spatially heterogeneous 222rn emanation rates schubert et al 2006 case 2 groundwater in disequilibrium mean aquifer rts for bank filtrate from w3 ranged between 0 5 days for low mixing ratios and up to 7 2 days for a mixing ratio of f 1 fig 6 for a constant mixing ratio an increase of the shifting parameter resulted in a decrease of the mean aquifer rts for the bank filtrate component fig 6 for shifting parameters a 0 10 and 20 days and a mixing ratio of f 0 7 the gamma type models for bank filtrate and groundwater are shown in fig 7 the gray shaded rtds in fig 7 are the compound rtds the unshifted groundwater rtd model fig 7a overlaps over a wide range of rts with the bank filtrate model this overlap leads to a compound rtd which is characterized by a lower maximum and a more pronounced tail compared to the rtd of the bank filtrate component the rtd for the groundwater in fig 7a represents a situation where extracted groundwater has not entirely reached the secular equilibrium resulting in a groundwater 222rn activity that is lower than the endmember activity by increasing a to 10 days the overlapping area between rtds for bank filtrate and groundwater becomes smaller and the resulting compound rtd is characterized by a secondary maximum fig 7b the increase in groundwater rts from a 0 to 10 days resulted in a reduction of the mean rts for the bank filtrate component from 5 6 to 4 7 days according to the linear mixing model for a measured 222 rn activity of 5610 bq m³ w2 the activity for the bank filtrate component must be reduced to compensate for the higher groundwater activity as the shifting parameter is increased if the shifting parameter is further increased to a 20 days all flow paths represented by the groundwater rtd have rts 20 days fig 7c and the 222rn in the groundwater is at secular equilibrium here the groundwater 222rn activity cannot be distinguished from the endmember activity and a further increase of the shifting parameter would not affect the mean rts of the bank filtrate component 4 summary and conclusions the rts of bank filtrate in aquifers is often directly linked to chemical and biological reactions and thus significantly influences drinking water quality short aquifer rts during bank filtration can result in drinking water with bacterial contamination high nutrient loadings significant organic micropollutant concentrations and poor taste tufenkji et al 2002 for water suppliers using bank filtration knowledge of aquifer rts and how it changes with river discharge and pumping rates is essential to designate water protection areas and to assess the risk of contamination during hydrological events such as flooding it is also important for validating models of the extraction area for large scale use in the drinking water sector a reliable and simple method is preferable which can be operated with minimal investment portable 222rn detectors have become available that can measure 222rn activities with high precision directly in the field and without the considerable laboratory infrastructure needed for liquid scintillation counting in this study we present a further development of the mathematical framework used for estimating rts from measured 222rn activities in pumping wells the approach is specifically intended to estimate aquifer rts for fully screened extraction wells where mixing of different sources and flow paths is important by neglecting mixing as done in previous work estimated aquifer rts are error prone and tend to be underestimated as they are based on highly simplified assumptions of the flow field we also show that 222rn can be used for age dating purposes beyond the 5 x half life limit of the standard model by using composite rtd models rather than an upper limit of 13 22 days depending on the precision of the detector the detection limit depends on the choice of rtd model in this context the presented approach represents a more general solution to what was used previously in literature and can be applied to more complex flow fields resulting in more realistic rt estimates the application presented as part of this study is based on a rather limited dataset the accuracy of the models presented in this work would benefit from estimating rts on a regular basis once a detector is available weekly or monthly 222rn measurements from extraction wells are inexpensive and easy to perform such data could be used to understand how pumping rates and different hydrologic conditions affect mean rts of the bank filtrate component combining the presented method with other tracer techniques e g 35so4 2 sulfur hexafluoride gadolinium stable isotopes of water or major ions would help to narrow down existing uncertainties such as filtrate groundwater mixing ratios and rtd characteristics often water suppliers are required by law to monitor water quality of infiltrating stream reaches and extracted water for contaminants e g heavy metals pharmaceuticals pesticides this data can also be used in combination with 222rn to estimate unknown system properties such as mixing ratios and check the plausibility of 222rn based modeling multiple groundwater monitoring wells located near the extraction site but not close enough to be directly affected by groundwater drawdown would provide the advantage of obtaining independent samples for endmember activities and to assess associated uncertainties that highly affect estimates for mean aquifer rts the assumption of a homogeneous endmember activity and a truly representative sample of this endmember is still problematic when using 222rn as a tracer for aquifer rts in our example we were unable to retrieve a water sample from the aquifer that could be unequivocally used as a unique endmember due to the physical setting of the well field and available sampling wells it is even questionable whether a single endmember activity even exists for alluvial aquifers as it is known that 222rn production can be heterogeneously distributed on small spatial scales cartwright and hofmann 2015 cecil and green 2000 for situations where reliable endmember activities cannot be obtained directly from extraction wells incubation experiments with aquifer material represent an alternative method of both obtaining an endmember value and quantifying a distribution of possible endmembers within the aquifer bourke et al 2014 preferably incubation experiments are carried out directly after drilling a pumping well where fresh aquifer material is available application of rtd as part of lumped parameter models assume that subsurface flow conditions in the aquifer are at steady state meaning that the rtd is a time invariant system characteristic for dynamic hydrological conditions such as flooding and or intensive rainstorms where the river stage is highly variable the assumption of a time invariant rtd is unrealistic for such conditions the model presented above would most likely be error prone reliable estimates for mean aquifer rts are best achieved during relative stable periods such as during baseflow or conditions with only low to moderate rainfall for flooding events continuous 222rn observations in extraction wells gilfedder et al 2013 could serve as an early warning system to indicate when short rt flood water is influencing the production wells this would be seen by rapidly falling 222rn activities in well water activity despite the assumptions and limitations of the method presented here we believe that 222rn has a high potential for application in the drinking water sector to monitor aquifer rts during bank filtration and thus assist in management of drinking water resources declaration of competing interest the
