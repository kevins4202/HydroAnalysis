3930,freshwater lakes close to the coast are important ecotones with strong functional dependency on ocean forces tides are likely to create dynamic lake groundwater interactions which have not been previously assessed for partially penetrating lakes this study investigates tidal lake groundwater interaction in a laboratory scale aquifer cross section with and without the existence of a partially penetrating lake experimental observations were found to be well matched to the results of numerical modeling in terms of the amplitudes and phases of pressure fluctuations at 19 locations the results show that the lake dampened tide induced pressure head fluctuations indicating that the enhanced storage capacity was more influential in modifying tidal propagation relative to the increased transmissiveness imparted by the lake the lake also caused stronger depth dependency in groundwater tidal fluctuations as determined from vertical profiles of tidal amplitude and phase vertical profiles also reveal that the tidal amplitude and phase responded differently to the addition of the lake in a manner that reflects previous studies of tidal propagation in layered aquifers tides created significant aquifer lake fluxes leading to strong rates of lake flushing particularly through the seaward lake boundary including a clogging layer at the lake bottom within numerical models tended to reduce the lake s effects on tidal propagation although clogging layer effects were complex this study highlights the important role of tides on partially penetrating lake groundwater exchange dynamics and the influence of partially penetrating lakes on tidal propagation in coastal settings albeit at the laboratory scale keywords groundwater tides laboratory experiments lake groundwater interaction variably saturated model 1 introduction coastal freshwater lakes lagoons and wetlands referred to collectively as coastal lakes herein often separated from the sea by narrow barriers of land occur in many places across the globe e g oertel 2005 examples in australia include nargal lake 36 16 54 s 150 8 4 e and bondi lake 36 47 54 s 149 56 4 e in new south wales timms 1997

2015 coastal lakes are often important resources in highly populated coastal areas providing drinking water and supporting agricultural industrial and recreational activities heggie skyring 1999 in addition coastal lakes often form productive and complicated ecosystems supporting a large variety of animal and plants species some of which are rare threatened or endangered australian government 2020b coastal freshwater lakes that are disconnected from the ocean may nevertheless be influenced by ocean dynamics through groundwater lake interactions hence exchanges between coastal lakes and aquifers may play an important role in controlling the lake water chemistry water quality aquatic habitat and biodiversity hagerthey kerfoot 1998 the effective management of coastal freshwater lakes therefore requires a proper understanding of lake groundwater interactions which in many cases will involve tidal forces the waves that travel through coastal aquifers caused by ocean tides have been widely studied using various approaches including field observations laboratory experiments and analytical and numerical modeling methods e g ataie ashtiani et al 1999 li et al 1997 li et al 2000a nielsen 1990 however the effects of surface water bodies such as coastal lakes on groundwater wave propagation in coastal aquifers is rarely considered the interactions between lakes and aquifers have received increased research attention in recent years mainly in efforts to better understand the role of groundwater in the water quality conditions of lakes e g robinson 2015 shaw et al 2013 previous lake aquifer analyses have adopted methods that include seepage meters e g rosenberry morin 2004 environmental tracers e g dimova et al 2013 numerical modeling e g chui freyberg 2008 and physical experimentation e g li et al 2007 perhaps the most relevant literature on the topic of tidal surface subsurface water interaction in coastal settings involves research into the hydrodynamics of coastal wetlands and lagoons these are connected to the sea whereas the current research considers lakes disconnected via surface pathways from the ocean xin et al 2011 developed a 3d model to investigate tidally driven pore water flow in a creek marsh system and highlighted that the tide provides the primary driving force of surface water groundwater interactions and mass transport processes in salt marshes cao et al 2012 conducted a field investigation to examine the hydrological characteristics of a salt marsh in the chongming dongtan wetland china their study revealed that the tide is likely the dominant factor affecting the marsh soil condition and co2 emissions which influence ecosystem functioning hart et al 2017 used tidal gauge data to investigate variations in water levels between the ocean and coastal lakes i e lake macquarie and lake illawarra in new south wales australia that are directly connected to the sea they found that tidal attenuation within the lakes was a function of lake entrance morphology ebrahimi et al 2007 conducted laboratory experiments of a tidal lagoon system which was separated from the sea by a sand embankment their laboratory observations showed the attenuating effect of the embankment on the tidal amplitude in the lagoon and revealed a 90 phase lag between the tidal fluctuations of the sea and those of the lagoon water surface liang et al 2007 tested their coupled surface subsurface flow model by comparing it to the laboratory experiments of ebrahimi et al 2007 obtaining a reasonable match between the model results and laboratory measurements they observed that tides caused the mean lake water level to exceed that of the sea the above mentioned studies i e ebrahimi et al 2007 liang et al 2007 assumed that the depth of the coastal lagoon and the aquifer were the same i e the lagoon fully penetrated the coastal aquifer however in most cases coastal lakes are only partially penetrating e g timms 1973 and aquifer lake interaction involves flow through the lake bottom which is neglected in cases of fully penetrating lakes furthermore the aforementioned studies investigated tidal propagation within the aquifer seaward of the lagoon whereas tidal propagation underneath and landward of partially penetrating coastal water bodies has not been examined this study attempts to overcome these shortcomings by investigating a coastal lake that partially penetrates a tidal coastal aquifer using a controlled laboratory setting this paper aims to examine tidal lake groundwater interaction under controlled laboratory conditions serving as the first published example of tidal partially penetrating lake groundwater interaction analysis the results are expected to highlight important lake aquifer interactions that control in part the water quality of coastal lakes and their ecological functioning particularly in relation to nutrient exchange carbon cycling and the transport of contaminants within tidal lake aquifer systems a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations are used to quantify a the influence of a partially penetrating coastal lake on groundwater wave propagation and b the flux exchange between the partially penetrating lake and the coastal aquifer lake aquifer interactions in real world coastal settings are likely to be extremely complex winter et al 1998 and the installation of field scale monitoring particularly to access and assess conditions beneath coastal lakes presents significant challenges thus the physical experiments conducted in this research offer an alternative to field analysis whereby detailed measurements can be made for an idealised downscaled coastal lake aquifer situation for example a 2d cross section was adopted which treats the lake as spatially continuous with a longitudinal axis parallel to the shoreline this allows for careful measurements of tidal lake aquifer interaction and comparison to the results of numerical modeling of the experiments aimed at characterising the main controlling factors occurring within the laboratory lake and aquifer numerical models were used to extend the analysis of the effects of lakes on groundwater wave propagation and lake aquifer flux exchanges occurring within the physical experiments 2 methods and materials 2 1 laboratory experiments two sets of experiments were conducted at griffith university australia in a sand tank of length equal to 9 m height of 1 5 m and width of 0 14 m fig 1 and fig s1 in the supplementary material the tank has a simple harmonic driving head reservoir at one end i e ocean boundary and a no flow boundary at the bottom and far end i e landward boundary density dependent effects were neglected given the challenges of elucidating tidal processes in the presence of complex buoyancy forces and due to limitations in the experimental apparatus thus freshwater was used for the ocean boundary the first experiment i e no lake case excluded the lake to provide a baseline of measurements allowing for the net effect of the lake to be analyzed in a subsequent experiment in which the lake was added the second experiment i e lake case was identical to the first except for the inclusion of a partially penetrating lake which was constructed using two 20 mm stainless steel wire mesh screens covered by geofabric to hold back the sand fig 1 this created a lake that acts effectively as a groundwater window i e the lake is strongly connected to the main aquifer system rather than disconnected through for example a low permeability perching layer australian government 2020a the screens were installed vertically and placed 0 6 m apart in the sand tank the sand between the screens was removed to construct a void area as a lake the bottom of the lake was located 0 65 m above the sand tank base i e 0 3 m below the mean water table elevation and the distance from the lake s left boundary to the vertical ocean boundary was 0 7 m fig 1 the sand used in the experiments was uniformly graded fine quartz sand that is d 50 0 26 mm and c u 6 where c u is the uniformity coefficient given by d 60 d 10 1 57 d 10 d 50 and d 60 l are the sand diameters at which 10 50 and 60 respectively of a sample s mass is comprised of finer particles the wet packing method was used to fill the tank whereby the sand was added to a water filled tank and manually mixed while settling to minimise any air encapsulation or layering effects due to differential settlement the uniformly graded nature of the sand and the controlled wet packing method described above aimed to create an aquifer that can be considered homogeneous and isotropic the physical and hydraulic properties of the sand used in the experiments were determined by shoushtari et al 2016 and shoushtari et al 2017 these include the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s lt 1 the saturated and residual volumetric moisture contents θ s and θ r respectively and van genuchten 1980 parameters α l 1 and β the total porosity ε was set to θ s parameter values are summarised in table 1 note that values of α and β given in table 1 represent initial pre calibration values that were adjusted through calibration as described in section 2 3 3 it should be noted that non coastal lakes i e inland lakes are often lined with low resistive materials or a clogging layer which typically has lower hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer surrounding the lake for example results of lake bottom resistivity surveys and seepage measurements at lake lacawac in northern pennsylvania showed that the lake seepage rate to from the aquifer was limited by a clogging layer nyquist et al 2009 hunt et al 1998 considered the existence of the clogging layer in a non coastal lake model of trout lake in northern wisconsin represented by a layer of uniform thickness and hydraulic conductivity of about 1 3 of the underlying aquifer value however investigations of the physical and chemical characteristics of bottom sediments for two coastal lakes in victoria australia i e lake barracoota and elusive lake showed that bed sediments primarily comprising sands timms 1973 in the laboratory experiment of the current study we neglected bed material of reduced hydraulic conductivity because of a lack of evidence of clogging layers within coastal lakes embedded in sandy aquifers thus the geofabric layer that lined the lake in our experiments is presumed to not restrict flow and the aquifer hydraulic conductivity surrounding the lake is assumed uniform pore water pressures were measured using an array of piezometers extending horizontally into the sand through the sand tank wall connecting directly to druck pdcr 1830 voltage output signal 4 20 mm h2o accuracy or druck ptx 1730 current output signal 3 75 mm h2o accuracy pressure sensors the locations of pressure sensors are shown by red dots in fig 1 where v and c denote druck pdcr 1830 and druck ptx 1730 pressure sensors respectively the unconfined sand tank aquifer was subjected to a simple harmonic driving head acting across the vertical ocean boundary this was produced by a vertically oscillating weir labelled as variable height overflow in fig 1 connected to an electric rotary motor via a cable the simple harmonic driving head can be expressed in the form of 1 h o t d a cos ω t where h o l is the driving head d l is the mean driving head a l is the driving head amplitude ω t 1 is the oscillation frequency i e ω 2π t o where t o t is the oscillation period and t t is the time the driving head parameters for both no lake and lake cases were t o 1922 s ω 0 0033 1 s d 0 95 m and a 0 2 m these parameters lead to a non dimensional aquifer depth i e εωd k s shoushtari et al 2016 equal to 2 which is equivalent to a semi diurnal tide i e t o 12 25 hrs in a 22 m deep aquifer with the same hydraulic properties of the sand used in the experiments i e k s 4 7 10 4 m s and ε 0 336 for each test the sand tank was subjected to continuous tidal fluctuations until a quasi steady oscillatory state was reached as determined by comparing the amplitudes and phases of successive groundwater waves and ensuring that these had reached relatively stable values in both cases at least five tidal cycles occurred before quasi steady conditions were attained the bottom and landward boundaries of the sand tank act as no flow boundary conditions the sand surface top boundary of the aquifer was covered with loose plastic to minimise evaporation whilst still allowing free connection with the atmosphere therefore there was no water exchange through the sand surface during experiments and it was hence considered as a no flow boundary condition for modeling purposes 2 2 groundwater wave number the dispersive characteristics of a groundwater wave may be quantified with complex wave numbers k l 1 which are estimated as follows under the assumption of small amplitude oscillation a d the form of pressure head fluctuations η l in response to a simple harmonic driving head equation 1 is e g barry et al 1996 li et al 2000b nielsen 1990 2 η a re e k x e i ω t a re e k r k i i x e i ω t a e k r x cos ω t k i x where k k r ik i l 1 is the complex wave number that describes the dispersive properties of the pressure head fluctuation here k r l 1 is the amplitude decay rate and k i l 1 is the rate of increase in the phase lag with distance from the ocean boundary i is the imaginary unit defined by i 1 equation 2 can be rearranged to perform a linear regression to derive the amplitude profile as e g cartwright et al 2003 nielsen 1990 3 η a e k r x k r x ln η a and the phase lag profile as 4 ϕ ϕ o k i x where η l and ϕ are the amplitude and phase at distance x and ϕ o is the phase at the ocean boundary o indicates the origin of x and z therefore by plotting the relevant quantities i e ln η a and ϕ ϕ o as a function of x the slope of the lines of best fit will yield the real and imaginary parts of the wave number i e k r and k i respectively 2 3 numerical modeling 2 3 1 governing equations water movement in variably saturated porous media is commonly described using richards 1931 equation the head based form of richards equation diersch 2014 in the absence of sink source terms can be expressed by 5 c s e s o ψ t k r k s h 0 h ψ z where c s ψ l 1 is the specific moisture capacity ψ l is the pressure head s e is the effective saturation s o l 1 is the specific storage accounting for porous media and fluid compressibility k r is the relative hydraulic conductivity h l is the hydraulic head z l is the elevation and is the gradient operator solving equation 5 requires prior knowledge of c and k r which depend on soil moisture retention properties here the well known van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 is used to quantify the soil moisture retention properties as 6 s e s s r s s s r θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α ψ β m for ψ 0 1 for ψ 0 where θ is the volumetric moisture content calculated as θ sε where s is the saturation and m 1 1 β subscripts s and r indicate saturated maximum and residual values respectively the parameter k r can be expressed by the following equation van genuchten 1980 7 k r s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 the specific moisture capacity is the derivative of equation 6 with respect to ψ leading to van genuchten 1980 8 c s ψ m α β α ψ β 1 1 α ψ β m 1 s s s r 2 3 2 model boundary conditions the model boundary conditions were prescribed to represent the sand tank configuration with variants for the no lake and lake cases as shown in fig 2 at the top bottom and landward boundaries a no flow condition was imposed i e q n 0 where q n lt 1 is the specific discharge normal to the boundary it should be noted that even though regional groundwater systems are expected to flow towards the sea in coastal aquifers aquifer recharge and lateral fresh groundwater flow from inland were neglected in laboratory experiments to simplify the problem and to isolate the effects of tides from other complicating factors i e aquifer recharge and lateral fresh groundwater flow in cases where the tidal amplitude is small relative to the aquifer thickness the system will respond approximately linearly e g serrano workman 1998 solórzano rivas werner 2020 and the principle of superposition applies reilly et al 1984 at the ocean boundary during the falling phase of the tide the water table exit point i e the intersection of the water table and the ocean boundary can become decoupled from the sea surface elevation leading to the formation of a seepage face the part of the vertical ocean boundary that potentially contains a seepage face is indicated by the vertical bold line labelled seepage face bc in fig 2 the location of the exit point and hence extent of the seepage face is not known a priori an iterative process is therefore required at each time step in order to determine the seepage face extent the seepage face is exposed to the atmosphere leading to ψ 0 m or equivalently h z where z is the boundary node elevation additionally discharge to the seepage face occurs normal to the shoreline boundary and is limited to outward flow only i e q n 0 consequently one of three different boundary conditions are applied at the ocean boundary depending on the elevation relative to the tide level fig 2 1 a dirichlet boundary condition is applied below the low water level lwl h o min where the prescribed head is the same as the driving head i e h t h o t 2 a seepage face boundary condition i e switching from prescribed head to head dependent flux depending on boundary node elevation i e z and the tidal ocean water level is implemented between the lwl and high water level hwl h o max in each time step if h o t is greater than z then the boundary head is prescribed as h t h o t otherwise if h o t is less than z the boundary head is set to h t z unless this creates a potential for seepage face flow from the sea into the aquifer in which case the boundary reverts to no flow conditions i e q n 0 further details of the periodic seepage face boundary condition can be found in shoushtari et al 2015 3 a no flow boundary condition i e q n 0 is applied above the hwl thus the conditions along the ocean boundary are defined by 9 h t h o t z h o min h t h o t if h o t z z if h o t z and q n 0 h o min z h o max q n 0 z h o max 2 3 3 model discretization and calibration the non hysteretic richards equation was solved using the finite element model feflow 6 2 dhi wasy gmbh 2014 the numerical model adopted a 4 noded quadrilateral mesh type with uniform size of 0 01 m 0 01 m i e δx δz leading to 135 000 mesh elements and 136 051 mesh nodes a preliminary grid resolution sensitivity analysis showed that the model results were effectively independent of the mesh size at this resolution that is for the no lake case pressure head amplitudes and phases were on average within 1 and 4 respectively of the model with a coarser mesh i e 0 01 m 0 01 m the adopted mesh resolution is also consistent with or finer than other richards equation models applied to similar oscillating system e g ataie ashtiani et al 1999 clement et al 1994 shoushtari et al 2016 werner lockington 2003 a constant time step length i e δt 1 s was used requiring 10 000 time steps 2 8 hrs to complete more than five tidal cycles the adopted mesh resolution provides a balance between accuracy of the results and reasonable computational run times which were up to 24 hrs on a quadcore processor intel core i5 7500 a manual trial and error approach was used to calibrate the no lake case model in which vg curve fitting parameters were adjusted to obtain a reasonable match between simulated and measured pressure head fluctuation time series this led to the following values α 3 m 1 and β 1 75 other parameters i e k s ε θ s and θ r remained at the values used by shoushtari et al 2016 and shoushtari et al 2017 as given in table 1 calibrated parameters were then adopted in simulations that included the lake 2 3 4 implementation of the lake into the model the lake was represented implicitly in the model by adopting soil hydraulic properties intended to simulate limited resistance to flow within the lake this was achieved in part by using a very high k s in the lake region this so called high k approach has been applied successfully in previous studies to represent surface water in both fully saturated e g anderson et al 2002 winter 1976 yihdego becht 2013 and variably saturated chui freyberg 2008 models anderson et al 2002 suggested that reasonable lake simulation is achieved when the h gradient i e dh dx across the lake is close to zero in this study the ratio of the lake to aquifer k s was chosen as 2000 as this was found to be large enough to create an almost horizontal lake water surface i e dh dx 10 5 m m see section 3 1 in addition to the high k approach to simulate the lake special consideration of the moisture distribution within and above the lake region was also required that is moisture retention functions were sought that create a relative narrow transition from saturation below the water surface to zero moisture content above the water surface i e a small capillary fringe while this can be achieved by adopting large values of the vg parameters α and β chui freyberg 2008 extremely large values of these parameters are known to introduce numerical convergence issues diersch 2014 as a compromise between numerical stability and the need to reflect lake atmosphere interface conditions α and β in the lake region were set to 1000 m 1 and 1 75 parameters defining storage behaviour in the lake region were set to ε 1 s s 1 and s r 0 which are consistent with the representation of surface water within the variably saturated model of chui freyberg 2008 this combination of ε s r s s α and β for the lake region provided a very small capillary fringe height h c l of around 6 10 4 m calculated by h c m 1 β α after wang et al 2000 and led to small values for s e and k r above the lake s water surface see eqs 6 and 7 additionally s o was set to zero in the lake region following previous studies that incorporate surface water processes within groundwater models e g chui freyberg 2008 diersch 2014 testing of these parameters and their effects on the representation of the lake and its interaction with the underlying aquifer is described in section 3 a summary of the parameter values adopted in numerical models for the no lake and lake cases is provided in table 2 given the limited available knowledge of lakebed characteristics for coastal lakes additional simulations were developed to extend the lake case to evaluate the influence of lakebed clogging the effects of including a lakebed clogging layer on groundwater wave propagation and lake groundwater fluxes were investigated using two additional numerical simulations these adopted a clogging layer thickness of 0 01 m and k s values of 4 7 10 5 m s i e 10 of the aquifer k s 0 1k aquifer case and 4 7 10 6 m s i e 1 of the aquifer k s 0 01k aquifer case other model parameters were the same as those used in the lake case see table 2 the results of simulations that included the lakebed clogging layer are compared to lake case results in the supplementary material 2 3 5 lake aquifer flux characterisation the flux into out of the lake was quantified by extracting from the numerical modeling results time series of total flux q l3t 1 normal to the lake s seaward vertical boundary left vertical boundary of the lake fig 1 and landward vertical boundary right vertical boundary of the lake fig 1 additionally the lake s bottom boundary was divided into the seaward and landward halves for the purposes of assessing groundwater lake exchanges q was calculated by summing individual flux values through each node δq l3t 1 over the length of each boundary segment δq was obtained as δq vδa where v lt 1 is either the horizontal darcy velocity i e vx lt 1 for the lake s vertical boundaries or the vertical darcy velocity i e vz lt 1 for the lake s bottom boundary δa l2 is the mesh cross sectional area perpendicular to the flow equal to δzδy for the lake s vertical boundaries and δxδy for the lake s bottom boundary here δx and δz l are the mesh sizes in and z directions respectively adopted as δx δz 0 01 m in the numerical model the δy l is the lake dimension perpendicular to the lake cross section which in the 2d numerical model was set to 1 m lake aquifer fluxes through the lake s corner nodes and at the mid point of the lake s bottom occur through only half of the mesh area due to the node centred approach of feflow to build confidence in the numerical modeling results especially in light of numerical and experimental noise see section 3 3 further evaluation of the lake aquifer flow regime within the model was provided by undertaking a transient water balance analysis of the lake a time series of the net flux q net l3t 1 was used to generate expected lake stage h l l variations and these were compared with the h l hydrograph extracted from the model results q net was calculated by summing the boundary fluxes as 10 q net q x sea ver q z sea bot q z land bot q x land ver where qx sea ver qx land ver qz sea bot and qz land bot l3t 1 are the fluxes through the lake s seaward vertical boundary landward vertical boundary seaward half of the bottom boundary and landward half of the bottom boundary respectively see section 3 3 h l at each time step was obtained from the time series of q net by the following routing expression 11 h l n h l n 1 q net n 1 q net n 2 δ t a s n 1 2 3 n here a s l2 is the lake surface area which is equal to w lδy 0 6 m2 and δt t is the time step 1 s equation 11 assumes a horizontal lake surface while q net n 1 q net n 2 represents the average q net in each time step superscripts n and n 1 denote variables of the present and previous time steps respectively n is the total number of time steps in one tidal cycle i e t o δt note that using equation 11 requires knowledge of the initial lake stage i e h l at t 0 h l n 0 which was taken from the numerical simulation as the lake stage in the middle of the lake i e at x 1 m at the start of the tidal cycle i e h l n 0 0 031 m see section 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model data comparison modeling outputs are compared to laboratory data to allow for an in depth evaluation of the experiments beyond those provided by direct measurements fig 3 compares the observed and simulated time series of fluctuations in pressure head i e η at various locations within the sand tank both no lake and lake cases are shown here η was obtained by subtracting the time averaged pressure head averaged over the oscillation period from the time varying signal the raw output data from the laboratory pressure sensors was passed through the savitzky golay filter savitzky golay 1964 the savitzky golay filter is a widely used method of smoothing noisy data that is based on local least squares polynomial approximation it leads to increased data precision while maintaining the shape and tendency of the data schafer 2011 the savitzky golay filter was applied using the scipy signal savgol filter function in the python scipy library virtanen et al 2020 results are shown for a single tidal cycle corresponding to the quasi steady conditions obtained after several warm up cycles see sections 2 1 and 2 3 3 the results indicate excellent matches between the model and laboratory observations harmonic analysis was used to extract the amplitude r l and phase ϕ from the observed and simulated time series of η and the results are provided in table s1 in the supplementary material the components for the first two harmonics were obtained to assess if any higher harmonics were generated noting that the forcing is simple harmonic the occurrence of higher harmonics may indicate non linearity in propagating groundwater waves due to finite amplitude effects e g cartwright et al 2003 parlange et al 1984 and therefore their occurrence can offer insights into complex tidal processes arising within the experiments at every location the amplitude of the second harmonic which was extracted from observed data for both no lake and lake cases not shown for brevity ranges from 1 10 4 m to 5 10 3 m these values are less than the amplitude of the driving head second harmonic i e 8 10 3 m and are less than the respective first harmonic amplitudes at each of the measurement points listed in table s1 in the supplementary material indicating that higher harmonics generated in the aquifer were relatively minor the model measurement mismatch was then quantified using the following metrics root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias and the coefficient of determination r2 rmse and pbias values closer to 0 and r2 closer to 1 indicate better agreement between measured and simulated data moriasi et al 2007 fig s2 in the supplementary material compares model and experimental results and table s2 in the supplementary material summarises those metrics for the model data comparison in terms of both the amplitude and phase data across the 19 monitoring points see fig 1 these statistics considered together suggest that the simulations were able to reproduce the observed data for both no lake and lake cases the good performance of the model also indicates that the high k method see section 2 3 4 adopted to simulate the lake aquifer system was a valid approach 3 2 influence of the lake on groundwater wave propagation 3 2 1 groundwater wave dispersion fig 4 shows the influence of the lake on the groundwater wave amplitude r and phase ϕ as determined from harmonic analysis of numerical model results along the base of the aquifer z 0 m the two upper plots show the attenuation in amplitude and shift in phase with distance from the ocean boundary for both no lake and lake cases while the lower plots illustrate the relative difference between two cases computed as r lake r no lake r no lake 100 and ϕ lake ϕ no lake ϕ no lake 100 the results in fig 4 show a significant increase in groundwater wave dissipation along the aquifer base due to the presence of the lake with smaller amplitudes and increased phase lag when the lake was included there are two key hydraulic characteristics of the lake that are expected to control tidal attenuation and are relevant to the trends shown in fig 4 that is the existence of the lake had two main hydraulic effects on the aquifer system namely an increase in both transmissivity t l2t 1 i e integrated hydraulic conductivity over the aquifer thickness and the storage coefficient or storativity s t i e combined storage effects of compressibility and unsaturated zone wetting and drying given that groundwater wave propagation is enhanced with increasing diffusivity t s t ferris 1951 increasing t of the aquifer system due to the high k s of the lake is expected to decrease groundwater wave dissipation while a larger s t due to the lake storage parameters see table 2 is expected to have the opposite effect i e greater dissipation of the tidal groundwater wave the more attenuated groundwater tides in the presence of the lake therefore indicate that lake storage effects rather than the high transmissiveness of the lake played the more dominant role in modifying tidal propagation the results also show that the influence of the lake is felt beyond its physical extent where relative to the no lake case additional dampening of the groundwater wave amplitude occurs throughout the region between the lake and the ocean boundary the amplitude relative difference fig 4c reflecting the effect of the lake on tides reaches a maximum of around 58 at 1 8 m from the coastline or 1 1 m landward of the lake s inland boundary before gradually decreasing beyond this point to 38 at x 7 m this is most likely due to the fact that tidal fluctuations were constrained at the lake due to the additional storage capacity provided by the lake the decay of r along the aquifer base under the lake despite the lake water surface being almost horizontal dh dx 10 5 m m indicates non hydrostatic behaviour in this region the increase in phase lag along the aquifer base fig 4b and 4d caused by the lake follows a similar trend to that of the amplitude reduction fig 4a and 4c except in the region seaward of the lake where the phase lag increase caused by the lake is smaller than the corresponding reduction in amplitude at x 0 5 m the increase in phase caused by the lake is only 3 increasing to 7 at the lake s seaward vertical boundary x 0 7 m and 24 at the lake s landward vertical boundary x 1 3 m the maximum phase lag increase caused by the lake is 29 occurring at x 2 m 1 3 m landward of the lake s inland boundary landward of this point i e 2 m x 7 m the difference in phase lag due to the presence of the lake is fairly stable i e 0 63 rad ϕ no lake ϕ lake 0 73 rad or phase lags between 191 s and 225 s to quantify the groundwater wave dispersive characteristics the groundwater wave numbers k were obtained by applying regression analysis see section 2 2 on the values of η corresponding to r ϕ and ϕ o which were calculated through harmonic analysis of the numerical model results table s1 in the supplementary material fig 4a and 4b fig 5 provides the regression analysis for the no lake case fig 5a and the lake case in the region seaward of the lake i e 0 m x 0 7 m fig 5b underneath the lake i e 0 7 m x 1 3 m fig 5c and landward of the lake i e 1 3 m x 7 m fig 5d the estimated wave numbers and their r2 values are given in table s3 in the supplementary material the k r values seaward of the lake and underneath the lake in the lake case fig 5 and table s3 in the supplementary material are on average 97 109 seaward of the lake and 85 underneath the lake greater than the k r for the no lake case this reflects the greater amplitude decay in the lake case in those areas however the k r value for the region landward of the lake is somewhat comparable 9 smaller to k r in the no lake case the influence of the lake on the rate of increase of phase lag k i is also apparent seaward of the lake and underneath the lake with k i being 25 and 164 larger respectively than the no lake case in those areas landward of the lake the rate is closer 10 larger to the no lake case these results indicate that the amplitude reduction and phase lag increase caused by the lake are mostly generated underneath and seaward of the lake note that the r2 values table s3 in the supplementary material are close to 1 which validates the application of equations 3 and 4 and the associated small amplitude assumption to the experimental lake aquifer conditions 3 2 2 vertical variations in the amplitude and phase of pressure head fluctuations as discussed in section 3 2 1 the experimental results show that while the lake surface is effectively horizontal the groundwater wave attenuates below the lake indicating vertical flow effects in this section the influence of the lake on vertical profiles of the harmonic components r and ϕ from modeling results are examined specifically simulated h time series were obtained and evaluated along several vertical profiles namely seaward of the lake x 0 1 and 0 5 m underneath the lake x 0 7 1 0 and 1 3 m and landward of the lake x 1 5 and 1 9 m these are compared to the same locations in the no lake case each profile extends from the aquifer base i e z 0 m to the elevation of the bottom of the lake i e z 0 65 m profiles of the normalised amplitude and phase i e r r 0 and ϕ ϕ 0 respectively where r 0 l is the amplitude and ϕ 0 is the phase at the aquifer base i e z 0 m are shown in fig 6 the relative differences of amplitude and phase between the lake case and no lake case computed as r lake r no lake r no lake 100 and ϕ lake ϕ no lake ϕ no lake 100 are illustrated in fig s3 in the supplementary material fig 6 panels a to g shows that in both cases the amplitudes are greater at the base of the aquifer than those at higher elevations consistent with this trend fig 6 panels a to g shows that phases at the aquifer base are lower than at higher elevations i e the normalised phases are increasingly 1 for z 0 m indicating that tidal groundwater waves travel faster along the aquifer base than those at higher elevations laboratory measurements show similar depth variations in amplitude and phase as those from numerical models this is apparent in the results of table s1 in the supplementary material which indicate that the r is greater and the ϕ is smaller in v8 and v9 relative to v1 and v2 respectively see fig 1 the vertical patterns in tidal characteristics in the no lake case were observed previously by cartwright et al 2003 and shoushtari et al 2016 in laboratory experiments they explained this behaviour using the finite aquifer depth theory i e non hydrostatic pressure of nielsen et al 1997 the smaller tidal amplitude and the greater phase shift at higher elevations within the aquifer were magnified in the presence of the lake at least in some places e g seaward of the lake 0 1 m x 1 0 m suggesting that vertical flows and hence non hydrostatic pressure effects were strengthened by the inclusion of the lake vertical profiles of tidal characteristics show that the presence of the lake complicates substantially tidal propagation within the aquifer for example the case with the lake shows much greater variability between r at z 0 65 m and r 0 than that of the no lake case that is seaward of the lake x 0 7 m r at z 0 65 m was up to 51 at the lake edge i e x 0 7 m and 26 under the centre of the lake i e x 1 0 m smaller than r 0 at the landward edge of the lake x 1 3 m r at z 0 65 m is only 0 4 smaller than r 0 this contrasts with the no lake case in which r at z 0 65 m is smaller than r 0 i e at z 0 m by between 2 and 6 interestingly vertical profiles in normalised amplitude are monotonic increasing from top to bottom in the no lake case but are non monotonic in the presence of the lake for example at x 1 3 m a minimum normalised amplitude of 0 94 exists at z 0 5 m fig 6e this suggests complex relationships between lake fluctuations and groundwater tides leading to non hydrostatic pressure effects caused by the lake landward of the lake and beneath the lake s landward edge the difference between r at z 0 65 m and r 0 is smaller fig 6f to 6g with introduction of the lake this indicates that there is localised enhanced propagation of tides at higher elevations e g at z 0 65 m at least relative to propagation along the aquifer base attributed to the high k representation of the lake which creates stronger tidal transmission in the upper aquifer than in the lower aquifer beyond the lake s landward edge x 1 3 m differences in the normalised amplitude with and without the lake at z 0 65 m reduce with increasing x indicating a diminishing role of the lake in tidal propagation in the no lake case the phase vertical profiles fig 6a to 6g show trends in ϕ with depth whereby ϕ at z 0 65 m is 4 greater ranging from 1 to 5 on average than ϕ 0 i e ϕ at z 0 m in the case with the lake complex ϕ trends are observed whereby ϕ at z 0 65 m is 52 greater than ϕ 0 at the lake edge x 0 7 m fig 6c but this difference steadily decreases to 5 at x 1 9 m fig 6g comparing the top and bottom rows of fig 6 reveals that the effects of the lake on tidal amplitude and phase differed for example the amplitude in some places e g at x 1 1 3 and 1 5 m decayed non monotonically with elevation however phase vertical profiles indicate monotonic relationships at all locations these results can be interpreted in light of differences between amplitude decay and phase lag increase in heterogeneous aquifers observed by trefry bekele 2004 the layered aquifers considered in the study of trefry bekele 2004 are similar to the arrangement within the region of the lake namely contrasting hydraulic properties in overlying layers thus the lake appears to impart controls on tidal propagation that mimic a layered aquifer in which inconsistencies between tidal amplitude and phase are known to arise trefry bekele 2004 3 3 tidally driven lake groundwater fluxes time series of q for the four lake boundary segments see section 2 3 5 for the lake case are shown in fig 7 note that the subscripts x and z in qx and qz denote the direction of the flow which is perpendicular to the boundary the positive and negative signs of q in fig 7 indicate the direction relative to the coordinate axes inflow into the lake q in l3t 1 and outflow from the lake q out l3t 1 through each boundary segment are also identified in fig 7 by the green dashed line and red solid line respectively the savitzky golay filter savitzky golay 1964 as described in section 3 1 was applied to smooth q time series obtained from the numerical model this was needed to remove numerical oscillations in q time series that arise from the highly nonlinear nature of the problem including the extreme values adopted for vadose zone parameters it is likely that the numerical oscillations in the results could be reduced by refining the mesh resolution but this will increase the computational run times given that model run times see section 2 3 3 are at the limit of acceptable time periods up to 24 hrs and based on the close match to laboratory results we consider numerical noise to be within reasonable limits the volume of water added into v in l3 and drained from v out l3 the lake was calculated by integrating q in and q out over time as shown in fig 7 simpson s rule kaw et al 2011 was used to calculate v in and v out which are summarised in fig 7 and table s4 in the supplementary material the net volumes of water v net l3 into from the lake over a tidal cycle taken as the difference between v in and v out are also given in fig 7 and table s4 in the supplementary material the results given in fig 7 and table s4 in the supplementary material indicate that the largest inflows and outflows of water to from the lake in one tidal cycle were through the lake s seaward vertical boundary and seaward half of the lake s bottom with around half of the total lake aquifer fluxes passing through the lake s seaward vertical boundary fig 7 and table s4 in the supplementary material results also show that around 40 of the total lake aquifer fluxes occurred through the lake s bottom boundary i e both seaward and landward half of the lake s bottom this highlights the importance of the lake bottom in groundwater lake exchanges noting that fully penetrating lagoons adopted in previous studies of tidal interactions between coastal lagoons and aquifers neglect fluxes through the lake bottom e g ebrahimi et al 2007 liang et al 2007 over a tidal cycle the total inflow of 0 058 m3 is about 33 of the lake s initial non tidal volume highlighting the considerable mixing in the laboratory lake caused by the tides under quasi equilibrium conditions the volume of water in the lake should remain unchanged after each tidal cycle leading to σv net 0 however there was a small residual value in σv net of 0 003 m3 i e 2 of v 0 and 6 of σv in v 0 l3 equal to d l w lδy 0 18 m3 where d l l is the initial water depth in the lake 0 3 m and w l l is the lake width 0 6 m likely associated with the approximate representation of the lake in the model and other numerical imprecisions these include unsaturated flow effects above the lake s water surface and representation of the lake as a high k zone in addition to small numerical oscillations in q time series and the application of signal filtering to remove them the v net values in fig 7 and table s4 in the supplementary material indicate that tides led to a net influx of groundwater to the lake through the vertical seaward boundary whereas the bottom and landward boundaries provided net discharge from the lake which was dominated by outflows through the landward vertical boundary however the net landward flux through the lake was relatively small e g v net 0 003 m3 through the seaward vertical boundary of the lake and of the same order of magnitude as the misclosure in the lake s water balance σv net 0 003 m3 therefore the net flux through the lake and within the underlying aquifer due to tidal pumping appears to have been small whereas cyclic fluxes through lake boundaries were relatively large the time series of h l calculated by equation 11 is compared with the measured and simulated h l at the middle of the lake in fig 8 the time series of q net calculated by equation 10 is also illustrated in fig 8 it should be noted that the wavy behaviour in simulated h l dot dashed line in fig 8 was caused by numerical oscillations as discussed previously this most likely arose from the selection of vg parameters i e α and β for the lake region which have been observed to create similar numerical oscillations in previous applications of unsaturated saturated modeling of free surface groundwater problems using feflow diersch 2014 model testing revealed that smoother curves of h l could be obtained by assigning alternative vg parameters e g a smaller value of α for the lake region results not shown however this increased model data discrepancies due to enhanced unsaturated zone effects above the lake surface fig 8 shows that the time series of h l obtained by equation 11 is in reasonable agreement with both measured and simulated time series with r2 values of 0 9926 and 0 9967 respectively this confirms that the simulated q net is not invalidated by the method of simulating the lake nor by the numerical noise produced by feflow the results in fig 8 also illustrate a phase shift of π 2 between lake aquifer fluxes and the lake water level hydrograph the tidal net fluxes that were observed in the current study may depend on many factors commonly encountered in real world settings that are neglected in the current idealised laboratory conditions for example the 3d effects of lake and aquifer settings effects of regional groundwater flow rainfall recharge evaporation density dependent flow wave setup storm surge pulses at exposed coasts etc on the lake aquifer interaction have not been considered rainfall and evaporation to from the lake will also modify the lake water budget as will surface water inflows to the lake or discharge from the lake directly to the sea the effect of the oscillatory lake aquifer fluxes on the position of seawater within the coastal aquifer has not been evaluated here but given the lake aquifer fluxes being generated there is likely to be an influence on the freshwater seawater interface location and width of the mixing zone the time averaged heads in the base of the aquifer were generally lower e g by 0 003 m at x 1 m with the addition of the lake and therefore the lake is likely to create enhanced seawater extent in the underlying aquifer at least for the situation that was studied this requires further testing using density dependent models and experiments 4 conclusions the current study applies laboratory experiments and numerical modeling to examine coastal lake groundwater interactions subjected to tidal fluctuations where the lake is partially penetrating this was achieved by comparing coastal aquifer conditions with and without a near shore partially penetrating lake the comparison of measured and simulated time series of pressure head fluctuations at 19 locations for both the lake and no lake scenarios showed very good agreement measured and simulated tidal amplitude and phase values showed a significant increase in groundwater wave dissipation in the lake case particularly underneath and seaward of the lake regions relative to the no lake case the dampening effect of the lake on groundwater wave propagation indicates that the enhanced storage capacity of the lake was more dominant than the increased transmissiveness of the aquifer system with the lake embedded in the aquifer the respective complex wave numbers were also obtained for different regions of the problem domain complex wave numbers show that the lake caused only minor dampening of groundwater tides in the region landward of the lake vertical profiles within the aquifer show increased tidal amplitude and phase with depth both with and without the lake vertical variations in amplitude and phase associated with vertical flows and non hydrostatic pressure distributions were accentuated by the lake in addition vertical profiles in amplitude and phase revealed that the lake imposed an influence over tidal propagation similarly to layered aquifer systems assessed in previous studies and therefore it appears that the lake exerted a surrogate role of layered heterogeneity on the system tides caused significant additional mixing between the lake and the surrounding aquifer over a tidal cycle the greatest exchange of water between the lake and the aquifer occurred across the lake s boundaries closest to the ocean the results highlighted the importance of tidally driven groundwater lake exchanges through the lake bottom which has been ignored in previous studies of fully penetrating coastal lagoons complex lake aquifer exchanges led to a phase shift of π 2 between lake aquifer fluxes and the lake stage sensitivity analysis based on numerical simulations showed that the existence of a thin lakebed clogging layer reduced the dampening effects of the lake particularly underneath and seaward of the lake regions therefore the groundwater wave propagated further and faster due to the local semi confinement of the aquifer beneath the lake caused by the lakebed clogging layer leading to reduced aquifer storativity the lakebed clogging layer also restricted flow through the lake bottom as expected additionally the clogging layer led to increased fluxes through the lake s seaward vertical boundary and lower fluxes through the lake s landward vertical boundary the lakebed clogging layer reduced the total volume of water exchange through all lake boundaries and consequently decreased the range of lake stage fluctuations this study provides insights into tidal lake groundwater interactions that are expected to have wide ranging implications for the management of coastal freshwater lakes and aquifers particularly in relation to water quality problems that depend on tide induced recirculation of groundwater within coastal lakes however additional investigation is warranted to consider a wider range of coastal processes on lake aquifer interactions and lake behavior including alternative lake geomorphologies 3d effects of lake and aquifer settings buoyancy

3930,freshwater lakes close to the coast are important ecotones with strong functional dependency on ocean forces tides are likely to create dynamic lake groundwater interactions which have not been previously assessed for partially penetrating lakes this study investigates tidal lake groundwater interaction in a laboratory scale aquifer cross section with and without the existence of a partially penetrating lake experimental observations were found to be well matched to the results of numerical modeling in terms of the amplitudes and phases of pressure fluctuations at 19 locations the results show that the lake dampened tide induced pressure head fluctuations indicating that the enhanced storage capacity was more influential in modifying tidal propagation relative to the increased transmissiveness imparted by the lake the lake also caused stronger depth dependency in groundwater tidal fluctuations as determined from vertical profiles of tidal amplitude and phase vertical profiles also reveal that the tidal amplitude and phase responded differently to the addition of the lake in a manner that reflects previous studies of tidal propagation in layered aquifers tides created significant aquifer lake fluxes leading to strong rates of lake flushing particularly through the seaward lake boundary including a clogging layer at the lake bottom within numerical models tended to reduce the lake s effects on tidal propagation although clogging layer effects were complex this study highlights the important role of tides on partially penetrating lake groundwater exchange dynamics and the influence of partially penetrating lakes on tidal propagation in coastal settings albeit at the laboratory scale keywords groundwater tides laboratory experiments lake

2015 coastal lakes are often important resources in highly populated coastal areas providing drinking water and supporting agricultural industrial and recreational activities heggie skyring 1999 in addition coastal lakes often form productive and complicated ecosystems supporting a large variety of animal and plants species some of which are rare threatened or endangered australian government 2020b coastal freshwater lakes that are disconnected from the ocean may nevertheless be influenced by ocean dynamics through groundwater lake interactions hence exchanges between coastal lakes and aquifers may play an important role in controlling the lake water chemistry water quality aquatic habitat and biodiversity hagerthey kerfoot 1998 the effective management of coastal freshwater lakes therefore requires a proper understanding of lake groundwater interactions which in many cases will involve tidal forces the waves that travel through coastal aquifers caused by ocean tides have been widely studied using various approaches including field observations laboratory experiments and analytical and numerical modeling methods e g ataie ashtiani et al 1999 li et al 1997 li et al 2000a nielsen 1990 however the effects of surface water bodies such as coastal lakes on groundwater wave propagation in coastal aquifers is rarely considered the interactions between lakes and aquifers have received increased research attention in recent years mainly in efforts to better understand the role of groundwater in the water quality conditions of lakes e g robinson 2015 shaw et al 2013 previous lake aquifer analyses have adopted methods that include seepage meters e g rosenberry morin 2004 environmental tracers e g dimova et al 2013 numerical modeling e g chui freyberg 2008 and physical experimentation e g li et al 2007 perhaps the most relevant literature on the topic of tidal surface subsurface water interaction in coastal settings involves research into the hydrodynamics of coastal wetlands and lagoons these are connected to the sea whereas the current research considers lakes disconnected via surface pathways from the ocean xin et al 2011 developed a 3d model to investigate tidally driven pore water flow in a creek marsh system and highlighted that the tide provides the primary driving force of surface water groundwater interactions and mass transport processes in salt marshes cao et al 2012 conducted a field investigation to examine the hydrological characteristics of a salt marsh in the chongming dongtan wetland china their study revealed that the tide is likely the dominant factor affecting the marsh soil condition and co2 emissions which influence ecosystem functioning hart et al 2017 used tidal gauge data to investigate variations in water levels between the ocean and coastal lakes i e lake macquarie and lake illawarra in new south wales australia that are directly connected to the sea they found that tidal attenuation within the lakes was a function of lake entrance morphology ebrahimi et al 2007 conducted laboratory experiments of a tidal lagoon system which was separated from the sea by a sand embankment their laboratory observations showed the attenuating effect of the embankment on the tidal amplitude in the lagoon and revealed a 90 phase lag between the tidal fluctuations of the sea and those of the lagoon water surface liang et al 2007 tested their coupled surface subsurface flow model by comparing it to the laboratory experiments of ebrahimi et al 2007 obtaining a reasonable match between the model results and laboratory measurements they observed that tides caused the mean lake water level to exceed that of the sea the above mentioned studies i e ebrahimi et al 2007 liang et al 2007 assumed that the depth of the coastal lagoon and the aquifer were the same i e the lagoon fully penetrated the coastal aquifer however in most cases coastal lakes are only partially penetrating e g timms 1973 and aquifer lake interaction involves flow through the lake bottom which is neglected in cases of fully penetrating lakes furthermore the aforementioned studies investigated tidal propagation within the aquifer seaward of the lagoon whereas tidal propagation underneath and landward of partially penetrating coastal water bodies has not been examined this study attempts to overcome these shortcomings by investigating a coastal lake that partially penetrates a tidal coastal aquifer using a controlled laboratory setting this paper aims to examine tidal lake groundwater interaction under controlled laboratory conditions serving as the first published example of tidal partially penetrating lake groundwater interaction analysis the results are expected to highlight important lake aquifer interactions that control in part the water quality of coastal lakes and their ecological functioning particularly in relation to nutrient exchange carbon cycling and the transport of contaminants within tidal lake aquifer systems a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations are used to quantify a the influence of a partially penetrating coastal lake on groundwater wave propagation and b the flux exchange between the partially penetrating lake and the coastal aquifer lake aquifer interactions in real world coastal settings are likely to be extremely complex winter et al 1998 and the installation of field scale monitoring particularly to access and assess conditions beneath coastal lakes presents significant challenges thus the physical experiments conducted in this research offer an alternative to field analysis whereby detailed measurements can be made for an idealised downscaled coastal lake aquifer situation for example a 2d cross section was adopted which treats the lake as spatially continuous with a longitudinal axis parallel to the shoreline this allows for careful measurements of tidal lake aquifer interaction and comparison to the results of numerical modeling of the experiments aimed at characterising the main controlling factors occurring within the laboratory lake and aquifer numerical models were used to extend the analysis of the effects of lakes on groundwater wave propagation and lake aquifer flux exchanges occurring within the physical experiments 2 methods and materials 2 1 laboratory experiments two sets of experiments were conducted at griffith university australia in a sand tank of length equal to 9 m height of 1 5 m and width of 0 14 m fig 1 and fig s1 in the supplementary material the tank has a simple harmonic driving head reservoir at one end i e ocean boundary and a no flow boundary at the bottom and far end i e landward boundary density dependent effects were neglected given the challenges of elucidating tidal processes in the presence of complex buoyancy forces and due to limitations in the experimental apparatus thus freshwater was used for the ocean boundary the first experiment i e no lake case excluded the lake to provide a baseline of measurements allowing for the net effect of the lake to be analyzed in a subsequent experiment in which the lake was added the second experiment i e lake case was identical to the first except for the inclusion of a partially penetrating lake which was constructed using two 20 mm stainless steel wire mesh screens covered by geofabric to hold back the sand fig 1 this created a lake that acts effectively as a groundwater window i e the lake is strongly connected to the main aquifer system rather than disconnected through for example a low permeability perching layer australian government 2020a the screens were installed vertically and placed 0 6 m apart in the sand tank the sand between the screens was removed to construct a void area as a lake the bottom of the lake was located 0 65 m above the sand tank base i e 0 3 m below the mean water table elevation and the distance from the lake s left boundary to the vertical ocean boundary was 0 7 m fig 1 the sand used in the experiments was uniformly graded fine quartz sand that is d 50 0 26 mm and c u 6 where c u is the uniformity coefficient given by d 60 d 10 1 57 d 10 d 50 and d 60 l are the sand diameters at which 10 50 and 60 respectively of a sample s mass is comprised of finer particles the wet packing method was used to fill the tank whereby the sand was added to a water filled tank and manually mixed while settling to minimise any air encapsulation or layering effects due to differential settlement the uniformly graded nature of the sand and the controlled wet packing method described above aimed to create an aquifer that can be considered homogeneous and isotropic the physical and hydraulic properties of the sand used in the experiments were determined by shoushtari et al 2016 and shoushtari et al 2017 these include the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s lt 1 the saturated and residual volumetric moisture contents θ s and θ r respectively and van genuchten 1980 parameters α l 1 and β the total porosity ε was set to θ s parameter values are summarised in table 1 note that values of α and β given in table 1 represent initial pre calibration values that were adjusted through calibration as described in section 2 3 3 it should be noted that non coastal lakes i e inland lakes are often lined with low resistive materials or a clogging layer which typically has lower hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer surrounding the lake for example results of lake bottom resistivity surveys and seepage measurements at lake lacawac in northern pennsylvania showed that the lake seepage rate to from the aquifer was limited by a clogging layer nyquist et al 2009 hunt et al 1998 considered the existence of the clogging layer in a non coastal lake model of trout lake in northern wisconsin represented by a layer of uniform thickness and hydraulic conductivity of about 1 3 of the underlying aquifer value however investigations of the physical and chemical characteristics of bottom sediments for two coastal lakes in victoria australia i e lake barracoota and elusive lake showed that bed sediments primarily comprising sands timms 1973 in the laboratory experiment of the current study we neglected bed material of reduced hydraulic conductivity because of a lack of evidence of clogging layers within coastal lakes embedded in sandy aquifers thus the geofabric layer that lined the lake in our experiments is presumed to not restrict flow and the aquifer hydraulic conductivity surrounding the lake is assumed uniform pore water pressures were measured using an array of piezometers extending horizontally into the sand through the sand tank wall connecting directly to druck pdcr 1830 voltage output signal 4 20 mm h2o accuracy or druck ptx 1730 current output signal 3 75 mm h2o accuracy pressure sensors the locations of pressure sensors are shown by red dots in fig 1 where v and c denote druck pdcr 1830 and druck ptx 1730 pressure sensors respectively the unconfined sand tank aquifer was subjected to a simple harmonic driving head acting across the vertical ocean boundary this was produced by a vertically oscillating weir labelled as variable height overflow in fig 1 connected to an electric rotary motor via a cable the simple harmonic driving head can be expressed in the form of 1 h o t d a cos ω t where h o l is the driving head d l is the mean driving head a l is the driving head amplitude ω t 1 is the oscillation frequency i e ω 2π t o where t o t is the oscillation period and t t is the time the driving head parameters for both no lake and lake cases were t o 1922 s ω 0 0033 1 s d 0 95 m and a 0 2 m these parameters lead to a non dimensional aquifer depth i e εωd k s shoushtari et al 2016 equal to 2 which is equivalent to a semi diurnal tide i e t o 12 25 hrs in a 22 m deep aquifer with the same hydraulic properties of the sand used in the experiments i e k s 4 7 10 4 m s and ε 0 336 for each test the sand tank was subjected to continuous tidal fluctuations until a quasi steady oscillatory state was reached as determined by comparing the amplitudes and phases of successive groundwater waves and ensuring that these had reached relatively stable values in both cases at least five tidal cycles occurred before quasi steady conditions were attained the bottom and landward boundaries of the sand tank act as no flow boundary conditions the sand surface top boundary of the aquifer was covered with loose plastic to minimise evaporation whilst still allowing free connection with the atmosphere therefore there was no water exchange through the sand surface during experiments and it was hence considered as a no flow boundary condition for modeling purposes 2 2 groundwater

the real and imaginary parts of the wave number i e k r and k i respectively 2 3 numerical modeling 2 3 1 governing equations water movement in variably saturated porous media is commonly described using richards 1931 equation the head based form of richards equation diersch 2014 in the absence of sink source terms can be expressed by 5 c s e s o ψ t k r k s h 0 h ψ z where c s ψ l 1 is the specific moisture capacity ψ l is the pressure head s e is the effective saturation s o l 1 is the specific storage accounting for porous media and fluid compressibility k r is the relative hydraulic conductivity h l is the hydraulic head z l is the elevation and is the gradient operator solving equation 5 requires prior knowledge of c and k r which depend on soil moisture retention properties here the well known van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 is used to quantify the soil moisture retention properties as 6 s e s s r s s s r θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α ψ β m for ψ 0 1 for ψ 0 where θ is

expressed by the following equation van genuchten 1980 7 k r s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 the specific moisture capacity is the derivative of equation 6 with respect to ψ leading to van genuchten 1980 8 c

cases as shown in fig 2 at the top bottom and landward boundaries a no flow condition was imposed i e q n 0 where q n lt 1 is the specific discharge normal to the boundary it should be noted that even though regional groundwater systems are expected to flow towards the sea in coastal aquifers aquifer recharge and lateral fresh groundwater flow from inland were neglected in laboratory experiments to simplify the problem and to isolate the effects of tides from other complicating factors i e aquifer recharge and lateral fresh groundwater flow in cases where the tidal amplitude is small relative to the aquifer thickness the system will respond approximately linearly e g serrano workman 1998 solórzano rivas werner 2020 and the principle of superposition applies reilly et al 1984 at the ocean boundary during the falling phase of the tide the water table exit point i e the intersection of the water table and the ocean boundary can become decoupled from the sea surface elevation leading to the formation of a seepage face the part of the vertical ocean boundary that potentially contains a seepage face is indicated by the vertical bold line labelled seepage face bc in fig 2 the location of the exit point and hence extent of the seepage face is not known a priori an iterative process is therefore required at each time step in order to determine the seepage face extent the seepage face is exposed to the atmosphere leading to ψ 0 m or equivalently h z where z is the boundary node elevation additionally discharge to the seepage face occurs normal to the shoreline boundary and is limited to outward flow only i e q n 0 consequently one of three different boundary conditions are applied at the ocean boundary depending on the elevation relative to the tide level fig 2 1 a dirichlet boundary condition is applied below the low water level lwl h o min where the prescribed head is the same as the driving head i e h t h o t 2 a seepage face boundary condition i e switching from prescribed head to head dependent flux depending on boundary node elevation i e z and the tidal ocean water level is implemented between the lwl and high water level hwl h o max in each time step if h o t is greater than z then the boundary head is prescribed as h t h o t otherwise if h o t is less than z the boundary head is set to h t z unless this creates a potential for seepage face flow from the sea into the aquifer in which case the boundary reverts to no flow conditions i e q n 0 further details of the periodic seepage face boundary condition can be found in shoushtari et al 2015 3 a no flow boundary condition i e q n 0 is applied above the hwl thus the conditions along the ocean boundary are defined by 9 h t h o t z h o min h t h o t if h o t z z if h o t z and q n 0 h o min z

adopted a 4 noded quadrilateral mesh type with uniform size of 0 01 m 0 01 m i e δx δz leading to 135 000 mesh elements and 136 051 mesh nodes a preliminary grid resolution sensitivity analysis showed that the model results were effectively independent of the mesh size at this resolution that is for the no lake case pressure head amplitudes and phases were on average within 1 and 4 respectively of the model with a coarser mesh i e 0 01 m 0 01 m the adopted mesh resolution is also consistent with or finer than other richards equation models applied to similar oscillating system e g ataie ashtiani et al 1999 clement et al 1994 shoushtari et al 2016 werner lockington 2003 a constant time step length i e δt 1 s was used requiring 10 000 time steps 2 8 hrs to complete more than five tidal cycles the adopted mesh resolution provides a balance between accuracy of the results and reasonable computational run times which were up to 24 hrs on a quadcore processor intel core i5 7500 a manual trial and error approach was used to calibrate the no lake case model in which vg curve fitting parameters were adjusted to obtain a reasonable match between simulated and measured pressure head fluctuation time series this led to the following values α 3 m 1 and β 1 75 other parameters i e k s ε θ s and θ r remained at the values used by shoushtari et al 2016 and shoushtari et al 2017 as given in table 1 calibrated parameters were then adopted in simulations that included the lake 2 3 4 implementation of the lake into the model the lake was represented implicitly in the model by adopting soil hydraulic properties intended to simulate limited resistance to flow within the lake this was achieved in part by using a very high k s in the lake region this so called high k approach has been applied successfully in previous studies to represent surface water in both fully saturated e g anderson et al 2002 winter 1976 yihdego becht 2013 and variably saturated chui freyberg 2008 models anderson et al 2002 suggested that reasonable lake simulation is achieved when the h gradient i e dh dx across the lake is close to zero in this study the ratio of the lake to aquifer k s was chosen as 2000 as this was found to be large enough to create an almost horizontal lake water surface i e dh dx 10 5 m m see section 3 1 in addition to the high k approach to simulate the lake special consideration of the moisture distribution within and above the lake region was also required that is moisture retention functions were sought that create a relative narrow transition from saturation below the water surface to zero moisture content above the water surface i e a small capillary fringe while this can be achieved by adopting large values of the vg parameters α and β chui freyberg 2008 extremely large values of these parameters are known to introduce numerical convergence issues diersch 2014 as a compromise between numerical stability and the need to reflect lake atmosphere interface conditions α and β in the lake region were set to 1000 m 1 and 1 75 parameters defining storage behaviour in the lake region were set to ε 1 s s 1 and s r 0 which are consistent with the representation of surface water within the variably saturated model of chui freyberg 2008 this combination of ε s r s s α and β for the lake region provided a very small capillary fringe height h c l of around 6 10 4 m calculated by h c m 1 β α after wang et al 2000 and led to small values for s e and k r above the lake s water surface see eqs 6 and 7 additionally s o was set to zero in the lake region following previous studies that incorporate surface water processes within groundwater models e g chui freyberg 2008 diersch 2014 testing of these parameters and their effects on the representation of the lake and its interaction with the underlying aquifer is described in section 3 a summary of the parameter values adopted in numerical models for the no lake and lake cases is provided in table 2 given the limited available knowledge of lakebed characteristics for coastal lakes additional simulations were developed to extend the lake case to evaluate the influence of lakebed clogging the effects of including a lakebed clogging layer on groundwater wave propagation and lake groundwater fluxes were investigated using two additional numerical simulations these adopted a clogging layer thickness of 0 01 m and k s values of 4 7 10 5 m s i e 10 of the aquifer k s 0 1k aquifer case and 4 7 10 6 m s i e 1 of the aquifer k s 0 01k aquifer case other model parameters were the same as those used in the lake case see table 2 the results of simulations that included the lakebed clogging layer are compared to lake case results in the supplementary material 2 3 5 lake aquifer flux characterisation the flux into out of the lake was quantified by extracting from the numerical modeling results time series of total flux q l3t 1 normal to the lake s seaward vertical boundary left vertical boundary of the lake fig 1 and landward vertical boundary right vertical boundary of the lake fig 1 additionally the lake s bottom boundary was divided into the seaward and landward halves for the purposes of assessing groundwater lake exchanges q was calculated by summing individual flux values through each node δq l3t 1 over the length of each boundary segment δq was obtained as δq vδa where v lt 1 is either the horizontal darcy velocity i e vx lt 1 for the lake s vertical boundaries or the vertical darcy velocity i e vz lt 1 for the lake s bottom boundary δa l2 is the mesh cross sectional area perpendicular to the flow equal to δzδy for the lake s vertical boundaries and δxδy for the lake s bottom boundary here δx and δz l are the mesh sizes in and z directions respectively adopted as δx δz 0 01 m in the numerical model the δy l is the lake dimension perpendicular to the lake cross section which in the 2d numerical model was set to 1 m lake aquifer fluxes through the lake s corner nodes and at the mid point of the lake s bottom occur through only half of the mesh area due to the node centred approach of feflow to build confidence in the numerical modeling results especially in light of numerical and experimental noise see section 3 3 further evaluation of the lake aquifer flow regime within the model was provided by undertaking a transient water balance analysis of the lake a time series of the net flux q net l3t 1 was used to generate expected lake stage h l l variations and these were compared with the h l hydrograph extracted from the model results q net was calculated by summing the boundary fluxes as 10 q net q x sea ver q z sea bot q z land bot q x land ver where qx sea ver qx land ver qz sea bot and qz land bot l3t 1 are the fluxes through the lake s seaward vertical boundary landward vertical boundary seaward half of the bottom boundary and landward half of the bottom boundary respectively see section 3 3 h l at each time step was obtained from the time series of q net by the following routing expression 11 h l n h l n 1 q net n 1 q net n 2 δ t a s n 1 2 3 n here a s l2 is the lake surface area which is equal to w lδy 0 6 m2 and δt t is the time step 1 s equation 11 assumes a horizontal lake surface while q net n 1 q net n 2 represents the average q net in each time step superscripts n and n 1 denote variables of the present and previous time steps respectively n is the total number of time steps in one tidal cycle i e t o δt note that using equation 11 requires knowledge of the initial lake stage i e h l at t 0 h l n 0 which was taken from the numerical simulation as the lake stage in the middle of the lake i e at x 1 m at the start of the tidal cycle i e h l n 0 0 031 m see section 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model data comparison modeling outputs are compared to laboratory data to allow for an in depth evaluation of the experiments beyond those provided by direct measurements fig 3 compares the observed and simulated time series of fluctuations in pressure head i e η at various locations within the sand tank both no lake and lake cases are shown here η was obtained by subtracting the time averaged pressure head averaged over the oscillation period from the time varying signal the raw output data from the laboratory pressure sensors was passed through the savitzky golay filter savitzky golay 1964 the savitzky golay filter is a widely used method of smoothing noisy data that is based on local least squares polynomial approximation it leads to increased data precision while maintaining the shape and tendency of the data schafer 2011 the savitzky golay filter was applied using the scipy signal savgol filter function in the python scipy library virtanen et al 2020 results are shown for a single tidal cycle corresponding to the quasi steady conditions obtained after several warm up cycles see sections 2 1 and 2 3 3 the results indicate excellent matches between the model and laboratory observations harmonic analysis was used to extract the amplitude r l and phase ϕ from the observed and simulated time series of η and the results are provided in table s1 in the supplementary material the components for the first two harmonics were obtained to assess if any higher harmonics were generated noting that the forcing is simple harmonic the occurrence of higher harmonics may indicate non linearity in propagating groundwater waves due to finite amplitude effects e g cartwright et al 2003 parlange et al 1984 and therefore their occurrence can offer insights into complex tidal processes arising within the experiments at every location the amplitude of the second harmonic which was extracted from observed data for both no lake and lake cases not shown for brevity ranges from 1 10 4 m to 5 10 3 m these values are less than the amplitude of the driving head second harmonic i e 8 10 3 m and are less than the respective first harmonic amplitudes at each of the measurement points listed in table s1 in the supplementary material indicating that higher harmonics generated in the aquifer were relatively minor the model measurement mismatch was then quantified using the following metrics root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias and the coefficient of determination r2 rmse and pbias values closer to 0 and r2 closer to 1 indicate better agreement between measured and simulated data moriasi et al 2007 fig s2 in the supplementary material compares model and experimental results and table s2 in the supplementary material summarises those metrics for the model data comparison in terms of both the amplitude and phase data across the 19 monitoring points see fig 1 these statistics considered together suggest that the simulations were able to reproduce the observed data for both no lake and lake cases the good performance of the model also indicates that the high k method see section 2 3 4 adopted to simulate the lake aquifer system was a valid approach 3 2 influence of the lake on groundwater wave propagation 3 2 1 groundwater wave dispersion fig 4 shows the influence of the lake on the groundwater wave amplitude r and phase ϕ as determined from harmonic analysis of numerical model results along the base of the aquifer z 0 m the two upper plots show the attenuation in amplitude and shift in phase with distance from the ocean boundary for both no lake and lake cases while the lower plots illustrate the relative difference between two cases computed as r lake r no lake r no lake 100 and ϕ lake ϕ no lake ϕ no lake 100 the results in fig 4 show a significant increase in groundwater wave dissipation along the aquifer base due to the presence of the lake with smaller amplitudes and increased phase lag when the lake was included there are two key hydraulic characteristics of the lake that are expected to control tidal attenuation and are relevant to the trends shown in fig 4 that is the existence of the lake had two main hydraulic effects on the aquifer system namely an increase in both transmissivity t l2t 1 i e integrated hydraulic conductivity over the aquifer thickness and the storage coefficient or storativity s t i e combined storage effects of compressibility and unsaturated zone wetting and drying given that groundwater wave propagation is enhanced with increasing diffusivity t s t ferris 1951 increasing t of the aquifer system due to the high k s of the lake is expected to decrease groundwater wave dissipation while a larger s t due to the lake storage parameters see table 2 is expected to have the opposite effect i e greater dissipation of the tidal groundwater wave the more attenuated groundwater tides in the presence of the lake therefore indicate that lake storage effects rather than the high transmissiveness of the lake played the more dominant role in modifying tidal propagation the results also show that the influence of the lake is felt beyond its physical extent where relative to the no lake case additional dampening of the groundwater wave amplitude occurs throughout the region between the lake and the ocean boundary the amplitude relative difference fig 4c reflecting the effect of the lake on tides reaches a maximum of around 58 at 1 8 m from the coastline or 1 1 m landward of the lake s inland boundary before gradually decreasing beyond this point to 38 at x 7 m this is most likely due to the fact that tidal fluctuations were constrained at the lake due to the additional storage capacity provided by the lake the decay of r along the aquifer base under the lake despite the lake water surface being almost horizontal dh dx 10 5 m m indicates non hydrostatic behaviour in this region the increase in phase lag along the aquifer base fig 4b and 4d caused by the lake follows a similar trend to that of the amplitude reduction fig 4a and 4c except in the region seaward of the lake where the phase lag increase caused by the lake is smaller than the corresponding reduction in amplitude at x 0 5 m the increase in phase caused by the lake is only 3 increasing to 7 at the lake s seaward vertical boundary x 0 7 m and 24 at the lake s landward vertical boundary x 1 3 m the maximum phase lag increase caused by the lake is 29 occurring at x 2 m 1 3 m landward of the lake s inland boundary landward of this point i e 2 m x 7 m the difference in phase lag due to the presence of the lake is fairly stable i e 0 63 rad ϕ no lake ϕ lake 0 73 rad or phase lags between 191 s and 225 s to quantify the groundwater wave dispersive characteristics the groundwater wave numbers k were obtained by applying regression analysis see section 2 2 on the values of η corresponding to r ϕ and ϕ o which were calculated through harmonic analysis of the numerical model results table s1 in the supplementary material fig 4a and 4b fig 5 provides the regression analysis for the no lake case fig 5a and the lake case in the region seaward of the lake i e 0 m x 0 7 m fig 5b underneath the lake i e 0 7 m x 1 3 m fig 5c and landward of the lake i e 1 3 m x 7 m fig 5d the estimated wave numbers and their r2 values are given in table s3 in the supplementary material the k r values seaward of the lake and underneath the lake in the lake case fig 5 and table s3 in the supplementary material are on average 97 109 seaward of the lake and 85 underneath the lake greater than the k r for the no lake case this reflects the greater amplitude decay in the lake case in those areas however the k r value for the region landward of the lake is somewhat comparable 9 smaller to k r in the no lake case the influence of the lake on the rate of increase of phase lag k i is also apparent seaward of the lake and underneath the lake with k i being 25 and 164 larger respectively than the no lake case in those areas landward of the lake the rate is closer 10 larger to the no lake case these results indicate that the amplitude reduction and phase lag increase caused by the lake are mostly generated underneath and seaward of the lake note that the r2 values table s3 in the supplementary material are close to 1 which validates the application of equations 3 and 4 and the associated small amplitude assumption to the experimental lake aquifer conditions 3 2 2 vertical variations in the amplitude and phase of pressure head fluctuations as discussed in section 3 2 1 the experimental results show that while the lake surface is effectively horizontal the groundwater wave attenuates below the lake indicating vertical flow effects in this section the influence of the lake on vertical profiles of the harmonic components r and ϕ from modeling results are examined specifically simulated h time series were obtained and evaluated along several vertical profiles namely seaward of the lake x 0 1 and 0 5 m underneath the lake x 0 7 1 0 and 1 3 m and landward of the lake x 1 5 and 1 9 m these are compared to the same locations in the no lake case each profile extends from the aquifer base i e z 0 m to the elevation of the bottom of the lake i e z 0 65 m profiles of the normalised amplitude and phase i e r r 0 and ϕ ϕ 0 respectively where r 0 l is the amplitude and ϕ 0 is the phase at the aquifer base i e z 0 m are shown in fig 6 the relative differences of amplitude and phase between the lake case and no lake case computed as r lake r no lake r no lake 100 and ϕ lake ϕ no lake ϕ no lake 100 are illustrated in fig s3 in the supplementary material fig 6 panels a to g shows that in both cases the amplitudes are greater at the base of the aquifer than those at higher elevations consistent with this trend fig 6 panels a to g shows that phases at the aquifer base are lower than at higher elevations i e the normalised phases are increasingly 1 for z 0 m indicating that tidal groundwater waves travel faster along the aquifer base than those at higher elevations laboratory measurements show similar depth variations in amplitude and phase as those from numerical models this is apparent in the results of table s1 in the supplementary material which indicate that the r is greater and the ϕ is smaller in v8 and v9 relative to v1 and v2 respectively see fig 1 the vertical patterns in tidal characteristics in the no lake case were observed previously by cartwright et al 2003 and shoushtari et al 2016 in laboratory experiments they explained this behaviour using the finite aquifer depth theory i e non hydrostatic pressure of nielsen et al 1997 the smaller tidal amplitude and the greater phase shift at higher elevations within the aquifer were magnified in the presence of the lake at least in some places e g seaward of the lake 0 1 m x 1 0 m suggesting that vertical flows and hence non hydrostatic pressure effects were strengthened by the inclusion of the lake vertical profiles of tidal characteristics show that the presence of the lake complicates substantially tidal propagation within the aquifer for example the case with the lake shows much greater variability between r at z 0 65 m and r 0 than that of the no lake case that is seaward of the lake x 0 7 m r at z 0 65 m was up to 51 at the lake edge i e x 0 7 m and 26 under the centre of the lake i e x 1 0 m smaller than r 0 at the landward edge of the lake x 1 3 m r at z 0 65 m is only 0 4 smaller than r 0 this contrasts with the no lake case in which r at z 0 65 m is smaller than r 0 i e at z 0 m by between 2 and 6 interestingly vertical profiles in normalised amplitude are monotonic increasing from top to bottom in the no lake case but are non monotonic in the presence of the lake for example at x 1 3 m a minimum normalised amplitude of 0 94 exists at z 0 5 m fig 6e this suggests complex relationships between lake fluctuations and groundwater tides leading to non hydrostatic pressure effects caused by the lake landward of the lake and beneath the lake s landward edge the difference between r at z 0 65 m and r 0 is smaller fig 6f to 6g with introduction of the lake this indicates that there is localised enhanced propagation of tides at higher elevations e g at z 0 65 m at least relative to propagation along the aquifer base attributed to the high k representation of the lake which creates stronger tidal transmission in the upper aquifer than in the lower aquifer beyond the lake s landward edge x 1 3 m differences in the normalised amplitude with and without the lake at z 0 65 m reduce with increasing x indicating a diminishing role of the lake in tidal propagation in the no lake case the phase vertical profiles fig 6a to 6g show trends in ϕ with depth whereby ϕ at z 0 65 m is 4 greater ranging from 1 to 5 on average than ϕ 0 i e ϕ at z 0 m in the case with the lake complex ϕ trends are observed whereby ϕ at z 0 65 m is 52 greater than ϕ 0 at the lake edge x 0 7 m fig 6c but this difference steadily decreases to 5 at x 1 9 m fig 6g comparing the top and bottom rows of fig 6 reveals that the effects of the lake on tidal amplitude and phase differed for example the amplitude in some places e g at x 1 1 3 and 1 5 m decayed non monotonically with elevation however phase vertical profiles indicate monotonic relationships at all locations these results can be interpreted in light of differences between amplitude decay and phase lag increase in heterogeneous aquifers observed by trefry bekele 2004 the layered aquifers considered in the study of trefry bekele 2004 are similar to the arrangement within the region of the lake namely contrasting hydraulic properties in overlying layers thus the lake appears to impart controls on tidal propagation that mimic a layered aquifer in which inconsistencies between tidal amplitude and phase are known to arise trefry bekele 2004 3 3 tidally driven lake groundwater fluxes time series of q for the four lake boundary segments see section 2 3 5 for the lake case are shown in fig 7 note that the subscripts x and z in qx and qz denote the direction of the flow which is perpendicular to the boundary the positive and negative signs of q in fig 7 indicate the direction relative to the coordinate axes inflow into the lake q in l3t 1 and outflow from the lake q out l3t 1 through each boundary segment are also identified in fig 7 by the green dashed line and red solid line respectively the savitzky golay filter savitzky golay 1964 as described in section 3 1 was applied to smooth q time series obtained from the numerical model this was needed to remove numerical oscillations in q time series that arise from the highly nonlinear nature of the problem including the extreme values adopted for vadose zone parameters it is likely that the numerical oscillations in the results could be reduced by refining the mesh resolution but this will increase the computational run times given that model run times see section 2 3 3 are at the limit of acceptable time periods up to 24 hrs and based on the close match to laboratory results we consider numerical noise to be within reasonable limits the volume of water added into v in l3 and drained from v out l3 the lake was calculated by integrating q in and q out over time as shown in fig 7 simpson s rule kaw et al 2011 was used to calculate v in and v out which are summarised in fig 7 and table s4 in the supplementary material the net volumes of water v net l3 into from the lake over a tidal cycle taken as the difference between v in and v out are also given in fig 7 and table s4 in the supplementary material the results given in fig 7 and table s4 in the supplementary material indicate that the largest inflows and outflows of water to from the lake in one tidal cycle were through the lake s seaward vertical boundary and seaward half of the lake s bottom with around half of the total lake aquifer fluxes passing through the lake s seaward vertical boundary fig 7 and table s4 in the supplementary material results also show that around 40 of the total lake aquifer fluxes occurred through the lake s bottom boundary i e both seaward and landward half of the lake s bottom this highlights the importance of the lake bottom in groundwater lake exchanges noting that fully penetrating lagoons adopted in previous studies of tidal interactions between coastal lagoons and aquifers neglect fluxes through the lake bottom e g ebrahimi et al 2007 liang et al 2007 over a tidal cycle the total inflow of 0 058 m3 is about 33 of the lake s initial non tidal volume highlighting the considerable mixing in the laboratory lake caused by the tides under quasi equilibrium conditions the volume of water in the lake should remain unchanged after each tidal cycle leading to σv net 0 however there was a small residual value in σv net of 0 003 m3 i e 2 of v 0 and 6 of σv in v 0 l3 equal to d l w lδy 0 18 m3 where d l l is the initial water depth in the lake 0 3 m and w l l is the lake width 0 6 m likely associated with the approximate representation of the lake in the model and other numerical imprecisions these include unsaturated flow effects above the lake s water surface and representation of the lake as a high k zone in addition to small numerical oscillations in q time series and the application of signal filtering to remove them the v net values in fig 7 and table s4 in the supplementary material indicate that tides led to a net influx of groundwater to the lake through the vertical seaward boundary whereas the bottom and landward boundaries provided net discharge from the lake which was dominated by outflows through the landward vertical boundary however the net landward flux through the lake was relatively small e g v net 0 003 m3 through the seaward vertical boundary of the lake and of the same order of magnitude as the misclosure in the lake s water balance σv net 0 003 m3 therefore the net flux through the lake and within the underlying aquifer due to tidal pumping appears to have been small whereas cyclic fluxes through lake boundaries were relatively large the time series of h l calculated by equation 11 is compared with the measured and simulated h l at the middle of the lake in fig 8 the time series of q net calculated by equation 10 is also illustrated in fig 8 it should be noted that the wavy behaviour in simulated h l dot dashed line in fig 8 was caused by numerical oscillations as discussed previously this most likely arose from the selection of vg parameters i e α and β for the lake region which have been observed to create similar numerical oscillations in previous applications of unsaturated saturated modeling of free surface groundwater problems using feflow diersch 2014 model testing revealed that smoother curves of h l could be obtained by assigning alternative vg parameters e g a smaller value of α for the lake region results not shown however this increased model data discrepancies due to enhanced unsaturated zone effects above the lake surface fig 8 shows that the time series of h l obtained by equation 11 is in reasonable agreement with both measured and simulated time series with r2 values of 0 9926 and 0 9967 respectively this confirms that the simulated q net is not invalidated by the method of simulating the lake nor by the numerical noise produced by feflow the results in fig 8 also illustrate a phase shift of π 2 between lake aquifer fluxes and the lake water level hydrograph the tidal net fluxes that were observed in the current study may depend on many factors commonly encountered in real world settings that are neglected in the current idealised laboratory conditions for example the 3d effects of lake and aquifer settings effects of regional groundwater flow rainfall recharge evaporation density dependent flow wave setup storm surge pulses at exposed coasts etc on the lake aquifer interaction have not been considered rainfall and evaporation to from the lake will also modify the lake water budget as will surface water inflows to the lake or discharge from the lake directly to the sea the effect of the oscillatory lake aquifer fluxes on the position of seawater within the coastal aquifer has not been evaluated here but given the lake aquifer fluxes being generated there is likely to be an influence on the freshwater seawater interface location and width of the mixing zone the time averaged heads in the base of the aquifer were generally lower e g by 0 003 m at x 1 m with the addition of the lake and therefore the lake is likely to create enhanced seawater extent in the underlying aquifer at least for the situation that was studied this requires further testing using density dependent models and experiments 4 conclusions the current study applies laboratory experiments and numerical modeling to examine coastal lake groundwater interactions subjected to tidal fluctuations where the lake is partially penetrating this was achieved by comparing coastal aquifer conditions with and without a near shore partially penetrating lake the comparison of measured and simulated time series of pressure head fluctuations at 19 locations for both the lake and no lake scenarios showed very good agreement measured and simulated tidal amplitude and phase values showed a significant increase in groundwater wave dissipation in the lake case particularly underneath and seaward of the lake regions relative to the no lake case the dampening effect of the lake on groundwater wave propagation indicates that the enhanced storage capacity of the lake was more dominant than the increased transmissiveness of the aquifer system with the lake embedded in the aquifer the respective complex wave numbers were also obtained for different regions of the problem domain complex wave numbers show that the lake caused only minor dampening of groundwater tides in the region landward of the lake vertical profiles within the aquifer show increased tidal amplitude and phase with depth both with and without the lake vertical variations in amplitude and phase associated with vertical flows and non hydrostatic pressure distributions were accentuated by the lake in addition vertical profiles in amplitude and phase revealed that the lake imposed an influence over tidal propagation similarly to layered aquifer systems assessed in previous studies and therefore it appears that the lake exerted a surrogate role of layered heterogeneity on the system tides caused significant additional mixing between the lake and the surrounding aquifer over a tidal cycle the greatest exchange of water between the lake and the aquifer occurred across the lake s boundaries closest to the ocean the results highlighted the importance of tidally driven groundwater lake exchanges through the lake bottom which has been ignored in previous studies of fully penetrating coastal lagoons complex lake aquifer exchanges led to a phase shift of π 2 between lake aquifer fluxes and the lake stage sensitivity analysis based on numerical simulations showed that the existence of a thin lakebed clogging layer reduced the dampening effects of the lake particularly underneath and seaward of the lake regions therefore the groundwater wave propagated further and faster due to the local semi confinement of the aquifer beneath the lake caused by the lakebed clogging layer leading to reduced aquifer storativity the lakebed clogging layer also restricted flow through the lake bottom as expected additionally the clogging layer led to increased fluxes through the lake s seaward vertical boundary and lower fluxes through the lake s landward vertical boundary the lakebed clogging layer reduced the total volume of water exchange through all lake boundaries and consequently decreased the range of lake stage fluctuations this study provides insights into tidal lake groundwater interactions that are expected to have wide ranging implications for the management of coastal freshwater lakes and aquifers particularly in relation to water quality problems that depend on tide induced recirculation of groundwater within coastal lakes however additional investigation is warranted to consider a wider range of coastal processes on lake aquifer interactions and lake behavior including alternative lake geomorphologies 3d effects of lake and aquifer settings buoyancy

water quality and socioeconomic development data were collected between 1990 and 2017 from hohhot in the inner mongolia autonomous region over the studied period the piedmont water level and the confined water level in the plain area of hohhot decreased by 34 98 and 28 08 m respectively and the shallow water level dropped sharply in 2005 and had decreased by 12 02 m by 2014 the hydrochemical type of groundwater changed from ca mg hco3 to ca na mg hco3 so4 the variability and complexity increased and the groundwater showed characteristics of salinization and hardening the no3 content and

environmental development wang 2018 nazari and ahmadi 2019 studies have shown that rapid urbanization affects precipitation changnon et al 1971 mote et al 2007 climate salerno et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 carbon emissions hanif 2018 wang and wang 2021 ecological environment ariken et al 2020 yu 2021 land use nath et al 2021 and the soil environment shaharoona et al 2019 most cities worldwide especially in arid areas are facing a dual pressure caused by groundwater depletion and water quality deterioration das kangabam et al 2017 cheng et al 2019 the existing studies on the relationship between urbanization and groundwater mainly discuss the groundwater level and quality separately such as the impact on groundwater resources hossain et al 2021 tam and nga 2018 the impact on groundwater quality ijioma 2021 zhang et al 2019 and the impact on some elements in groundwater such as iodine huang et al 2020a phosphorus huang et al 2020b etc therefore the spatial and temporal correlation between groundwater level and quality under the influence of urbanization is ignored however as an important influencing factor of groundwater circulation the influence of groundwater level on hydrochemistry can not be ignored few studies have considered the relationship between urbanization and the groundwater environment both including groundwater level and quality groundwater environmental degradation is a complex process affected by natural processes and human activities mainly including mineral dissolution evaporation and transpiration aquifer overflow domestic sewage industrial wastewater and agricultural irrigation water infiltration especially in the case of large scale exploitation of groundwater in the process of urbanization the natural balance of the groundwater system is broken the regional groundwater cycle and formation conditions have changed significantly resulting in changes of the quantity quality and temporal and spatial distribution of groundwater resources research on the mechanism of interaction between urbanization and the groundwater environment is key to protecting the groundwater environment effectively it serves as an essential basis for decision makers to formulate groundwater environment deterioration control measures based on the previous work we selected hohhot as the representative of rapid urbanization and adopted the data at a large time scale from 1990 to 2017 this rapid urbanization in hohhot has caused severe pressures on the local groundwater environment mainly manifesting in a decrease in the groundwater level and a deterioration of water quality jia 2018 the main aims of the current study were as follows 1 to identify the evolution of urbanization and groundwater environment over time 2 to analyze the response of groundwater level and quality to rapid urbanization 3 to explore the mechanism of groundwater environmental degradation 4 to identify the main factors of groundwater environmental degradation caused by rapid urbanization based on principal component analysis pca and 5 to propose a conceptual model of groundwater degradation in the process of urbanization addressing these aims will provide a scientific basis for the protection of groundwater resources in hohhot and the sustainable utilization of regional groundwater resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hohhot is located in the central part of the inner mongolia autonomous region the provincial capital of which is a major open city along the border of northern china fig 1 it is located in the western inner mongolia plateau north of the yin mountain south of the yellow river east of the manhan mountain loess hilly region in the middle of the daqing mountain alluvial plain and in the south of the dahei river alluvial plain between 110 46 e 112 10 e and 40 51 n 41 8 n transportation is convenient in the study area the beijing baotou railway which runs through north and northwest china passes through the study area both the hohhot baotou railway and the roads connected with the border provinces of mongolia and russia provide a guarantee for the rapid development of the regional economy since the reform and opening up hohhot has seized the opportunity of western development and actively promoted industrialization agricultural intensification and animal husbandry and urbanization and promoted the comprehensive and coordinated and sustainable development of the economy and society the study area belongs to a temperate arid and semi arid continental monsoon climate with a long and cold winter warm and hot summer and concentrated rainfall the annual average temperature varies between the north and the south it is 2 5 c north of the daqing mountain whereas it ranges from 5 6 c to 7 0 c south of the daqing mountain the frozen period is from november to february of the following year the seasonal distribution of precipitation in the study area is uneven mainly concentrated in june to september accounting for 78 of the total annual precipitation the evaporation varies spatially increasing gradually from north to south and is distributed unevenly through the year evaporation is greatest in spring accounting for 58 6 of the total whereas winter only accounts for 8 9 according to the occurrence conditions of groundwater and pore characteristics of the aquifer medium the groundwater in hohhot is divided into loose rock pore water clastic rock fracture pore water and bedrock fracture water the study area is mainly composed of loose rock pore water fig 2 and the water bearing medium is mainly composed of quaternary loose rock such as gravel medium sand and fine sand the pore aquifer of the quaternary system can be divided into single structure aquifer in the piedmont and double layer aquifer in the plain area the groundwater in the study area flows from northeast to southwest and the groundwater in the whole area is basically recharged by precipitation infiltration the groundwater of the single structure aquifer is mainly fed by mountain runoff the single structure diving flows from the piedmont to the plain area and the shallow groundwater and the confined water is supplied in the form of lateral runoff at the boundary of the muddy clay layer the two layer aquifers in the plain area are mainly recharged by the single structure phreatic water of the piedmont and shallow aquifers are also recharged by the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation and river water because of the huge industrial agricultural and domestic water consumption artificial exploitation has become the main form of groundwater discharge in recent years with the acceleration of urbanization the continuous overexploitation of groundwater has led to the decline of the regional groundwater level and the local formation of a depression funnel 2 2 socio economic and groundwater environment data the social and economic development data for hohhot from 1990 to 2017 were extracted from the statistical yearbook of the inner mongolia autonomous region 1990 2017 rural statistical yearbook of the inner mongolia autonomous region 1990 2017 and statistical yearbook of hohhot 1990 2017 the data include gross domestic product gdp primary industry gdp pigdp i e planting forestry animal husbandry and aquaculture secondary industry or processing and manufacturing industry gdp sigdp tertiary industry or service industry tigdp per capita gdp pgdp cultivated land area cl permanent population pp urbanization and amount of chemical fertilizer application acfa we collected groundwater level and quality data from 1990 to 2017 from nine long term monitoring stations from the groundwater monitoring department of hohhot fig 1 the data include water level salinity hardness ph and the contents of k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and f pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to determine the relationship between the groundwater environment and socioeconomic development pca was used to investigate the impact of various socioeconomic development indicators on the groundwater environment spss v24 ibm new york usa was used for all statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 urbanization since the reform and opening up in the late 1970s china has experienced rapid urbanization and industrialization gu et al 2013 in the western city of hohhot the urbanization process has lagged behind that of beijing shanghai and other big cities as shown in fig 3 a the population and urbanization rate of hohhot increased approximately linearly from 1990 to 2017 reaching 3 11 106 and 69 09 respectively the area of urban built up area expanded from 73 km2 in 1990 to 260 km2 in 2017 from 1990 to 2017 hohhot s gdp showed an exponential growth and was 108 times higher in 2017 than in 1990 the per capita gdp increased from 1641 yuan in 1990 to 107 468 yuan in 2017 with an average annual growth of 16 fig 3b hohhot is known as the dairy capital of china as the number of dairy cows milk production and per capita share rank first in china it also hosts the two most famous chinese dairy brands yili and mengniu with the speeding up of the socialist new rural construction process the primary industry in hohhot has continuously adjusted and optimized the structure of agricultural cultivation but the proportion of primary industry gdp has gradually decreased at the same time to meet the demands of the secondary and tertiary industries hohhot has formed a complete industrial system including dairy processing electronic information electric power industry and biopharmaceuticals which has realized the comprehensive upgrading of the industrial structure and is a solid support for economic growth hohhot is the first capital city in the process of economic radiation and transfer from beijing the capital of china to the western region the supporting role of the service industry in the economy has become increasingly obvious from 1990 to 2017 the tertiary industry in hohhot has grown rapidly the proportion of the tertiary industry in gdp has increased and the service finance high tech and other industries have developed enormously fig 3c 3 2 dynamic variation of the groundwater level groundwater is the primary source of agricultural industrial and domestic water in hohhot precipitation infiltration is the main recharge source of groundwater and artificial exploitation is the main discharge cause from 1980s with the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization the intensity of groundwater exploitation has increased leading to a decrease in the groundwater level year by year fig 4 according to the monitoring data the groundwater level in hohhot has shown a regional downward trend in 1960s according to previous studies from 1959 to 1983 the average phreatic water level of single structure in the northern piedmont of hohhot decreased by 18 48 m and the average confined water level in the plain area decreased by 22 55 m li et al 1984 the piedmont single structure phreatic water is closely related to the plain confined water and their water level dynamics are similar fig 4a from 1985 to 1992 a comprehensive reform of the economic system of hohhot was carried out the establishment of township enterprises reached a climax and the economy underwent rapid development jia 2018 with increasing groundwater exploitation the groundwater level correspondingly dropped rapidly fig 4a b and the decline rates of single structure phreatic water and confined water in the plain area were 1 37 and 1 35 m a respectively after 2005 the urban economic system reform led to continuous improvements but the demand for water resources remained huge meanwhile the supporting facilities for the water supply project for the yellow river inflow and drainage were gradually completed which has somewhat alleviated the pressure of groundwater exploitation and the rate of groundwater level decline has slowed from 2005 to 2017 the decline rates of single structure diving and pressure water in the plain area were 0 87 and 0 67 m a respectively although the water level of shallow groundwater fluctuated from the early 1980s to 2005 it was generally stable from 2005 to 2014 the water level dropped abruptly at a rate of 1 34 m a which was related to the lack of lateral recharge in front of the mountain by 2005 a number of reservoirs and interception works were completed in the daqing mountain in the northern part of the city and the water level in front of the mountain dropped sharply to the bottom of the shallow aquifer after 2014 the local government issued certain groundwater control measures and the shallow groundwater level has shown a stable upward trend in recent years fig 4c comparing the data of two monitoring wells in the south of the city far from the urban area it is found that the water level has remained stable for many years fig 4d 3 3 temporal evolution of groundwater chemistry the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in the basin are affected by many factors they are the result of long term effects of various factors such as the chemical composition of rocks runoff conditions climate topography and recharge and discharge conditions of groundwater before 1965 the groundwater in hohhot maintained its natural state with a low degree of exploitation and good water quality the chemical type of groundwater was ca mg hco3 li et al 1984 however with the decline of groundwater level and the influence of human activities groundwater chemistry changed accordingly in 1984 ca mg hco3 was still the main hydrochemical type in hohhot but ca mg hco3 cl type was found in the shallow water in the urban area from 1990 to 1999 the chemical types of groundwater changed little remaining mainly ca mg hco3 however the ca mg na hco3 type appeared in some areas and the water quality developed towards salinization from 2006 to 2010 the water quality was further salinized and 5 of the 9 monitoring wells were the mg na ca hco3 cl and ca na mg hco3 so4 type from 2015 to 2017 the chemical types of groundwater became relatively complex the detection rate of the hco3 type decreased only 2 of 9 monitoring wells were ca mg hco3 whereas the content of na in ca2 dominated water increased further and the na type was observed in one monitoring well the proportion of so4 2 in the hco3 dominated water increased further previous studies li et al 1984 and years of monitoring data have shown that with the development of urbanization the hydrochemical types of groundwater in hohhot have become more complex fig 5 the change of water quality will directly affect the sustainable development of the social economy 3 4 temporal evolution of groundwater quality groundwater water quality evolution is closely related to the development of the city before 1950 hohhot was a small city of only 9 km2 with a weak industrial foundation there was a small urban population low groundwater exploitation and good groundwater quality according to the previous research results before 1964 the groundwater maintained the natural dynamics being mainly influenced by natural factors and these can be used as the regional groundwater chemical background value the salinity of groundwater was less than 500 mg l and the no3 concentration was only 5 24 mg l li et al 1984 the statistical results from 1972 to 1983 showed that the contents of cl and so4 2 increased considerably the distribution area of cl at 100 200 mg l was 4 0 km2 in 1978 7 0 km2 in 1980 and 22 15 km2 in 1982 the distribution area of so4 2 at 100 200 mg l was 2 5 km2 in 1978 7 0 km2 in 1980 and 28 30 km2 in 1982 li et al 1984 by 1985 the salinity in the southern part of the built up area was generally more than 500 mg l and that in some monitoring points was more than 1000 mg l after 1995 with the acceleration of urbanization in hohhot the concentrations of all water quality indicators generally showed an upward trend as shown in fig 6 a the time trend of the ph value fluctuated slightly but was generally stable and all samples met the grade iii national quality standard groundwater in china gb t 14848 2017 ranging from 6 5 to 8 5 ministry of land and resources of china and ministry of water resources of china 2017 fig 6b c show that k na ca2 mg2 so4 2 and cl contents gradually increased in a fluctuating manner and occasionally decreased annually whereas the hco3 content showed a decreasing and then increasing trend the no3 content salinity and hardness which are greatly affected by urbanization show a linear upward trend fig 6d hardness and no3 content have exceeded the limits of the grade iii national quality standard for groundwater 450 and 88 6 mg l gb t 14848 2017 since 2005 and 2006 respectively this shows that the deterioration of groundwater quality has also worsened with increasing urbanization and intensity of human activities 4 discussion urbanization not only brings convenience to human life but also increases the demand for resources for a long time the excessive exploitation of groundwater and the pollutants produced by human activities have directly affected the groundwater and threatened the groundwater environment historically scholars have focused on the impact of rapid urbanization on climate surface runoff and atmosphere but have paid less attention to the groundwater environment however in recent years groundwater funnel and water quality deterioration have been brought to the attention of researchers in china li 2013 qiu 2011 zhang et al 2015 as the capital of the inner mongolia autonomous region hohhot has a huge demand for water resources with the rapid development of the social economy over the years of overexploitation the groundwater level has declined and a large area of groundwater funnel has appeared the distribution area of the confined groundwater depression cone in the low water period of 2019 was 504 38 km2 123 65 km2 higher than that in the same period in 2018 and the funnel center water depth was 55 63 m yun et al 2019 the negative effect of rapid urbanization on the groundwater environment is mainly manifested in the decline of groundwater level and the deterioration of water quality 4 1 driving force of groundwater environment evolution in urbanization the demand for water resources has greatly increased with the rapid development of the social economy in areas lacking surface water resources the groundwater exploitation is increasing year by year causing the groundwater system to become out of balance overexploitation for many years leads to the continuous decline of groundwater level forming a regional depression funnel the decline of the groundwater level will indirectly affect the quality of the groundwater with the increase in the thickness of the aeration zone the original reduction conditions switch to oxidation conditions which increases the groundwater infiltration path γ c a 2 m g 2 meq l γ hc o 3 s o 4 2 meq l can reflect the dissolution of carbonate and sulfate minerals this ion ratio was about 1 from 1990 to 2004 and showed an upward trend after 2005 fig 7 the new flow path is conducive to the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the concentration of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater increases which leads to an increase in groundwater hardness zhang et al 2017 the strong extraction of groundwater makes the alternating circulation of groundwater intensify and the water rock action is strengthened the dissolution of soluble salt in aquifer is accelerated by dissolution and filtration which results in the increase of groundwater salinity xing 2017 as a result the hydrochemical type of groundwater in hohhot has changed from ca mg hco3 to ca na mg hco3 so4 urbanization will inevitably lead to an increase in population and the development of industrialization the discharge of domestic sewage garbage and industrial wastewater aggravates the risk of groundwater pollution from 1990 to 2017 the arable land area in hohhot was decreasing while the application of chemical fertilizer was increasing therefore the application of chemical fertilizer per unit area of arable land increases year by year which has formed a situation of transitional use of chemical fertilizer with the decrease in the groundwater level and the increase in the aeration zone thickness the saturated stratum becomes the aeration zone the oxidation is strengthened which is beneficial to the formation of some pollutants for example ammonia is converted to nitrate as shown below simultaneously the drop in groundwater level also leads to a change in groundwater dynamic conditions increases the hydraulic gradient accelerates the migration and infiltration of pollutants in surface water and soil and causes groundwater pollution overexploitation of groundwater can also lead to cross pollution of different aquifers since the change of groundwater level leads to the overflow recharge between different aquifers 2 n h 4 3 o 2 nitritebacteria 2 n o 2 2 h 2 o 4 h 2 n o 2 3 o 2 nitrifyingbacteria 2 n o 3 finally the expansion of the city changes the original land use and the proportion of impervious area such as urban buildings and road increases the impervious underlying surface changes the original hydrological cycle reduces the recharge of precipitation and surface runoff to groundwater and increases the negative effect of urbanization on the groundwater environment barron et al 2013 4 2 influence of urbanization on groundwater level and quality during urbanization the population increases year by year the built up area gradually increases the groundwater exploitation increases and the groundwater level decreases under the dual influence of natural conditions and human activities the dynamic conditions of groundwater have considerably changed the original water rock balance is broken and the hydrochemical field is altered in addition the pollutants produced by human activities directly or indirectly act on the groundwater and threaten regional groundwater quality table 1 shows that except for ph and hco3 the main ion composition of groundwater comprehensive indicators of water quality and groundwater level are significantly or extremely significantly correlated with indicators of the urbanization process such as social economy and population in recent years gdp and population in hohhot have grown rapidly the total amounts of industrial wastewater domestic sewage and solid waste have increased significantly the treatment facilities of sewage and solid waste remain backward the discharge of domestic and industrial sewage is not up to standard and the treatment of solid waste also poses a challenge additionally in order to increase crop yield the use of chemical fertilizer is increasing which poses a threat to groundwater quality the contents of cl so4 2 and no3 are important indicators to reflect the influence of human activities on groundwater quality martín del campo et al 2014 table 1 shows that cl so4 2 and no3 are moderately correlated with indicators that characterize the urbanization process fig 6 with the development of urbanization cl so4 2 and no3 show an increasing trend indicating that anthropogenic activities have a major impact on groundwater quality the groundwater level and socioeconomic development of hohhot were highly negatively correlated with population growth table 1 which indicates that urbanization leads directly to the decline of groundwater level the decline of the groundwater level indirectly affects the quality of groundwater as shown in fig 6 and table 1 the groundwater level decreases with the development of urbanization whereas groundwater hardness and salinity increase year by year this is because the groundwater level drops under the excessive exploitation of groundwater which changes the original reduction environment into an oxidation environment and increases the recharge distance of infiltration the new recharge path contributes to the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the leaching of soluble salts in aquifers and increased groundwater hardness and salinity moreover as shown in table 2 groundwater hardness is highly correlated with the ca2 mg2 and hco3 contents and salinity is highly correlated with the ca2 and hco3 contents and moderately correlated with the mg2 k na cl and no3 contents again the increases in groundwater hardness and salinity are affected by groundwater overexploitation and environmental pollution 4 3 driving mechanism of groundwater environment degradation the degradation of the groundwater environment is affected by many factors pca is a powerful technique to reveal the relationship between geochemical variables and urbanization indexes by reducing the dimensions of a large number of parameters pca was used to find out the main factors causing the deterioration of groundwater environment zhang et al 2019 as shown in table 3 pca reduced the original 23 variables to three key independent factors three principal components with eigenvalues greater than 1 were retained accounting for 83 27 of the total variance as shown in table 3 pc1 accounted for 60 28 of the total variance has strong negative loading on groundwater level strong positive loading on mg2 content k content na content gdp pigdp sigdp tigdp pgdp cl pp urbanization and acfa and a medium positive loading on cl content hardness and salinity gdp pigdp sigdp tigdp pp and urbanization are indicators reflecting social and economic development and population growth social and economic development and population growth consume considerable groundwater resources producing a lot of wastewater changing the groundwater environment and causing the deterioration of groundwater quality therefore social and economic development and population growth can be regarded as the driving factors of groundwater level decline and water quality deterioration pc2 accounted for 16 31 of the total variance and had moderate positive loading on ca2 content hco3 content hardness and salinity these indexes are mainly related to water rock interaction and leaching huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in the process of urbanization in hohhot the exploitation of groundwater resources leads to the decrease in the water level and the increasing thickness of the aeration zone the hydrochemical environment and hydrodynamic conditions changed which enhanced the water rock interaction and leaching therefore pc2 was regarded as the driving force of groundwater quality deterioration pc3 accounted for 6 68 of the total variance with strong positive loading on the no3 content salinity pp and urbanization and medium positive loading on the k content na content and acfa pp and urbanization are the key indicators reflecting the growth of the social population population growth directly leads to an increase in domestic sewage and solid waste discharge at the same time fertilizer application continues to increase in order to increase crop yield these pollutants inevitably pose a threat to groundwater quality therefore pc3 can be regarded as groundwater pollution caused by population and chemical fertilizer application based on the analysis of aquifer structure and sediment characteristics a conceptual model of groundwater environment deterioration in the process of urbanization in hohhot is summarized fig 8 it can be seen that the groundwater flow pattern changes from the piedmont to the plain the driving force of groundwater environment deterioration in hohhot is classified as the comprehensive reflection of the following factors groundwater level drop caused by artificial mining water rock interaction and mineral dissolution irrigation infiltration including rivers and canals caused by artificial mining etc this conceptual model has certain reference value for the analysis of groundwater environment deterioration mechanism in the process of urbanization all over the world 5 conclusion in this study hohhot the capital city of western china was selected as a representative city to assess the impact of urbanization on the groundwater environment of the region the analysis was based on data of water quality monitoring wells the monitoring data of groundwater level and the statistical data of social economy and rural development provided by the hohhot bureau of statistics from 1990 to 2007 with the development of urbanization groundwater exploitation is intense and the water level continues to decline the piedmont phreatic water level in the urban area was closely related to the confined water in the plain area and the dynamic trend of the water level was consistent showing an approximate linear decline from 1990 to 2017 the piedmont phreatic water level and the confined water level decreased by 34 98 and 28 08 m respectively the shallow water level in the plain area dropped sharply in 2005 and had dropped by 12 02 m by 2014 moreover the decline rate of groundwater level varied among the different stages of urbanization under the intensive exploitation of groundwater the thickness of the aeration zone increased and the reduction environment changed to an oxidation environment leading to changes in the groundwater dynamic field and hydrochemical field the hydrochemical type of groundwater changed from ca mg hco3 to ca na mg hco3 so4 the variability and complexity increased and the groundwater was subjected to salinization and hardening moreover the groundwater quality deteriorated significantly and the hardness and no3 content exceeded the limits of the grade iii national quality standard for groundwater in 2005 and 2006 respectively the cl so4 2 and no3 contents are easily affected by human activities and have shown a fluctuating increase moreover water level ca2 content mg2 content so4 2 content and hardness are highly correlated with the urbanization development index the pca attributed the deterioration of groundwater environment to social and economic development population growth groundwater overexploitation and chemical fertilizer application national and local governments should propose environmental management measures according to the actual situation to better realize the sustainable development of the social economy and resources and to reduce environmental damage credit

3931,urbanization may change the groundwater environment this study aimed to explore the degree and mechanism of the response of the groundwater environment to rapid urbanization groundwater level water quality and socioeconomic development data were collected between 1990 and 2017 from hohhot in the inner mongolia autonomous region over the studied period the piedmont water level and the confined water level in the plain area of hohhot decreased by 34 98 and 28 08 m respectively and the shallow water level dropped sharply in 2005 and had decreased by 12 02 m by 2014 the hydrochemical type of groundwater changed from ca mg hco3 to ca na mg hco3 so4 the variability and complexity increased and the groundwater showed characteristics of salinization and hardening the no3 content and hardness exceeded class iii of the chinese national groundwater quality standard range in 2005 and 2006 respectively water level ca2 content mg2 content so4 2 content and hardness were highly correlated with socioeconomic development indicators principal component analysis attributed the deterioration of the groundwater environment to socioeconomic development population growth overexploitation of groundwater and fertilizer application therefore the national and local governments should pay attention to the balance between socioeconomic development and groundwater environment keywords urbanization groundwater quality groundwater hydrochemistry driving factors 1 introduction urbanization is a necessary stage of industrialization and modernization and it is one of the important indicators of the level of economic and social development of a country at present half of the world s population live in cities population division department of economic and social and united nations 2012 the formation and prosperity of cities provide the impetus for economic development urbanization is of great importance for promoting the healthy and sustainable development of the national economy realizing the coordinated development of urban and rural areas and optimizing the industrial structure urbanization in china also presents a sustained and rapid growth trend with the urbanization rate increasing from 18 57 in 1978 to 58 52 in 2017 china s population accounts for about a fifth of the world s population and thus its urbanization represents an important indicator of the status of world urbanization with rapid urbanization several problems inevitably arise in particular there is tremendous pressure on resources and difficulties in achieving sustainable environmental development wang 2018 nazari and ahmadi 2019 studies have shown that rapid urbanization affects precipitation changnon et al 1971 mote et al 2007 climate salerno et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 carbon emissions hanif 2018 wang and wang 2021 ecological environment ariken et al 2020 yu 2021 land use nath et al 2021 and the soil environment shaharoona et al 2019 most cities worldwide especially in arid areas are facing a dual pressure caused by groundwater depletion and water quality deterioration das kangabam et al 2017 cheng et al 2019 the existing studies on the relationship between urbanization and groundwater mainly discuss the groundwater level and quality separately such as the impact on groundwater resources hossain et al 2021 tam and nga 2018 the impact on groundwater quality ijioma 2021 zhang et al 2019 and the impact on some elements in groundwater such as iodine huang et al 2020a phosphorus huang et al 2020b etc therefore the spatial and temporal correlation between groundwater level and quality under the influence of urbanization is ignored however as an important influencing factor of groundwater circulation the influence of groundwater level on hydrochemistry can not be ignored few studies have considered the relationship between urbanization and the groundwater environment both including groundwater level and quality groundwater environmental degradation is a complex process affected by natural processes and human activities mainly including mineral dissolution evaporation and transpiration aquifer overflow domestic sewage industrial wastewater and agricultural irrigation water infiltration especially in the case of large scale exploitation of groundwater in the process of urbanization the natural balance of the groundwater system is broken the regional groundwater cycle and formation conditions have changed significantly resulting in changes of the quantity quality and temporal and spatial distribution of groundwater resources research on the mechanism of interaction between urbanization and the groundwater environment is key to protecting the groundwater environment effectively it serves as an essential basis for decision makers to formulate groundwater environment deterioration control measures based on the previous work we selected hohhot as the representative of rapid urbanization and adopted the data at a large time scale from 1990 to 2017 this rapid urbanization in hohhot has caused severe pressures on the local groundwater environment mainly manifesting in a decrease in the groundwater level and a deterioration of water quality jia 2018 the main aims of the current study were as follows 1 to identify the evolution of urbanization and groundwater environment over time 2 to analyze the response of groundwater level and quality to rapid urbanization 3 to explore the mechanism of groundwater environmental degradation 4 to identify the main factors of groundwater environmental degradation caused by rapid urbanization based on principal component analysis pca and 5 to propose a conceptual model of groundwater degradation in the process of urbanization addressing these aims will provide a scientific basis for the protection of groundwater resources in hohhot and the sustainable utilization of regional groundwater resources 2 materials and methods 2

structure phreatic water of the piedmont and shallow aquifers are also recharged by the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation and river water because of the huge industrial agricultural and domestic water consumption artificial exploitation has become the main form of groundwater discharge in recent years with the acceleration of urbanization the continuous overexploitation of groundwater has led to the decline of the regional groundwater level and the local formation of a depression funnel 2 2 socio economic and groundwater environment data the social and economic development data for hohhot from 1990 to 2017 were extracted from the statistical yearbook of the inner mongolia autonomous region 1990 2017 rural statistical yearbook of the inner mongolia autonomous region 1990 2017 and statistical yearbook of hohhot 1990 2017 the data include gross domestic product gdp primary industry gdp pigdp i e planting forestry animal husbandry and aquaculture secondary industry or processing and manufacturing industry gdp sigdp tertiary industry or service industry tigdp per capita gdp pgdp cultivated land area cl permanent population pp urbanization and amount of chemical fertilizer application acfa we collected groundwater level and quality data from 1990 to 2017 from nine long term monitoring stations from the groundwater monitoring department of hohhot fig 1 the data include water level salinity hardness ph and the contents of k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and f pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to determine the relationship between the groundwater environment and socioeconomic development pca was used to investigate the impact of various socioeconomic development indicators on the groundwater environment spss v24 ibm new york usa was used for all statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 urbanization since the reform and opening up in the late 1970s china has experienced rapid urbanization and industrialization gu et al 2013 in the western city of hohhot the urbanization process has lagged behind that of beijing shanghai and other big cities as shown in fig 3 a the population and urbanization rate of hohhot increased approximately linearly from 1990 to 2017 reaching 3 11 106 and 69 09 respectively the area of urban built up area expanded from 73 km2 in 1990 to 260 km2 in 2017 from 1990 to 2017 hohhot s gdp showed an exponential growth and was 108 times higher in 2017 than in 1990 the per capita gdp increased from 1641 yuan in 1990 to 107 468 yuan in 2017 with an average annual growth of 16 fig 3b hohhot is known as the dairy capital of china as the number of dairy cows milk production and per capita share rank first in china it also hosts the two most famous chinese dairy brands yili and mengniu with the speeding up of the socialist new rural construction process the primary industry in hohhot has continuously adjusted and optimized the structure of agricultural cultivation but the proportion of primary industry gdp has gradually decreased at the same time to meet the demands of the secondary and tertiary industries hohhot has formed a complete industrial system including dairy processing electronic information electric power industry and biopharmaceuticals which has realized the comprehensive upgrading of the industrial structure and is a solid support for economic growth hohhot is the first capital city in the process of economic radiation and transfer from beijing the capital of china to the western region the supporting role of the service industry in the economy has become increasingly obvious from 1990 to 2017 the tertiary industry in hohhot has grown rapidly the proportion of the tertiary industry in gdp has increased and the service finance high tech and other industries have developed enormously fig 3c 3 2 dynamic variation of the groundwater level groundwater is the primary source of agricultural industrial and domestic water in hohhot precipitation infiltration is the main recharge source of groundwater and artificial exploitation is the main discharge cause from 1980s with the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization the intensity of groundwater exploitation has increased leading to a decrease in the groundwater level year by year fig 4 according to the monitoring data the groundwater level in hohhot has shown a regional downward trend in 1960s according to previous studies from 1959 to 1983 the average phreatic water level of single structure in the northern piedmont of hohhot decreased by 18 48 m and the average confined water level in the plain area decreased by 22 55 m li et al 1984 the piedmont single structure phreatic water is closely related to the plain confined water and their water level dynamics are similar fig 4a from 1985 to 1992 a comprehensive reform of the economic system of hohhot was carried out the establishment of township enterprises reached a climax and the economy underwent rapid development jia 2018 with increasing groundwater exploitation the groundwater level correspondingly dropped rapidly fig 4a b and the decline rates of single structure phreatic water and confined water in the plain area were 1 37 and 1 35 m a respectively after 2005 the urban economic system reform led to continuous improvements but the demand for water resources remained huge meanwhile the supporting facilities for the water supply project for the yellow river inflow and drainage were gradually completed which has somewhat alleviated the pressure of groundwater exploitation and the rate of groundwater level decline has slowed from 2005 to 2017 the decline rates of single structure diving and pressure water in the plain area were 0 87 and 0 67 m a respectively although the water level of shallow groundwater fluctuated from the early 1980s to 2005 it was generally stable from 2005 to 2014 the water level dropped abruptly at a rate of 1 34 m a which was related to the lack of lateral recharge in front of the mountain by 2005 a number of reservoirs and interception works were completed in the daqing mountain in the northern part of the city and the water level in front of the mountain dropped sharply to the bottom of the shallow aquifer after 2014 the local government issued certain groundwater control measures and the shallow groundwater level has shown a stable upward trend in recent years fig 4c comparing the data of two monitoring wells in the south of the city far from the urban area it is found that the water level has remained stable for many years fig 4d 3 3 temporal evolution of groundwater chemistry the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in the basin are affected by many factors they are the result of long term effects of various factors such as the chemical composition of rocks runoff conditions climate topography and recharge and discharge conditions of groundwater before 1965 the groundwater in hohhot maintained its natural state with a low degree of exploitation and good water quality the chemical type of groundwater was ca mg hco3 li et al 1984 however with the decline of groundwater level and the influence of human activities groundwater chemistry changed accordingly in 1984 ca mg hco3 was still the main hydrochemical type in hohhot but ca mg hco3 cl type was found in the shallow water in the urban area from 1990 to 1999 the chemical types of groundwater changed little remaining mainly ca mg hco3 however the ca mg na hco3 type appeared in some areas and the water quality developed towards salinization from 2006 to 2010 the water quality was further salinized and 5 of the 9 monitoring wells were the mg na ca hco3 cl and ca na mg hco3 so4 type from 2015 to 2017 the chemical types of groundwater became relatively complex the detection rate of the hco3 type decreased only 2 of 9 monitoring wells were ca mg hco3 whereas the content of na in ca2 dominated water increased further and the na type was observed in one monitoring well the proportion of so4 2 in the hco3 dominated water increased further previous studies li et al 1984 and years of monitoring data have shown that with the development of urbanization the hydrochemical types of groundwater in hohhot have become more complex fig 5 the change of water quality will directly affect the sustainable development of the social economy 3 4 temporal evolution of groundwater quality groundwater water quality evolution is closely related to the development of the city before 1950 hohhot was a small city of only 9 km2 with a weak industrial foundation there was a small urban population low groundwater exploitation and good groundwater quality according to the previous research results before 1964 the groundwater maintained the natural dynamics being mainly influenced by natural factors and these can be used as the regional groundwater chemical background value the salinity of groundwater was less than 500 mg l and the no3 concentration was only 5 24 mg l li et al 1984 the statistical results from 1972 to 1983 showed that the contents of cl and so4 2 increased considerably the distribution area of cl at 100 200 mg l was 4 0 km2 in 1978 7 0 km2 in 1980 and 22 15 km2 in 1982 the distribution area of so4 2 at 100 200 mg l was 2 5 km2 in 1978 7 0 km2 in 1980 and 28 30 km2 in 1982 li et al 1984 by 1985 the salinity in the southern part of the built up area was generally more than 500 mg l and that in some monitoring points was more than 1000 mg l after 1995 with the acceleration of urbanization in hohhot the concentrations of all water quality indicators generally showed an upward trend as shown in fig 6 a the time trend of the ph value fluctuated slightly but was generally stable and all samples met the grade iii national quality standard groundwater in china gb t 14848 2017 ranging from 6 5 to 8 5 ministry of land and resources of china and ministry of water resources of china 2017 fig 6b c show that k na ca2 mg2 so4 2 and cl contents gradually increased in a fluctuating manner and occasionally decreased annually whereas the hco3 content showed a decreasing and then increasing trend the no3 content salinity and hardness which are greatly affected by urbanization show a linear upward trend fig 6d hardness and no3 content have exceeded the limits of the grade iii national quality standard for groundwater 450 and 88 6 mg l gb t 14848 2017 since 2005 and 2006 respectively this shows that the deterioration of groundwater quality has also worsened with increasing urbanization and intensity of human activities 4 discussion urbanization not only brings convenience to human life but also increases the demand for resources for a long time the excessive exploitation of groundwater and the pollutants produced by human activities have directly affected the groundwater and threatened the groundwater environment historically scholars have focused on the impact of rapid urbanization on climate surface runoff and atmosphere but have paid less attention to the groundwater environment however in recent years groundwater funnel and water quality deterioration have been brought to the attention of researchers in china li 2013 qiu 2011 zhang et al 2015 as the capital of the inner mongolia autonomous region hohhot has a huge demand for water resources with the rapid development of the social economy over the years of overexploitation the groundwater level has declined and a large area of groundwater funnel has appeared the distribution area of the confined groundwater depression cone in the low water period of 2019 was 504 38 km2 123 65 km2 higher than that in the same period in 2018 and the funnel center water depth was 55 63 m yun et al 2019 the negative effect of rapid urbanization on the groundwater environment is mainly manifested in the decline of groundwater level and the deterioration of water quality 4 1 driving force of groundwater environment evolution in urbanization the demand for water resources has greatly increased with the rapid development of the social economy in areas lacking surface water resources the groundwater exploitation is increasing year by year causing the groundwater system to become out of balance overexploitation for many years leads to the continuous decline of groundwater level forming a regional depression funnel the decline of the groundwater level will indirectly affect the quality of the groundwater with the increase in the thickness of the aeration zone the original reduction conditions switch to oxidation conditions which increases the groundwater infiltration path γ c a 2 m g 2 meq l γ hc o 3 s o 4 2 meq l can reflect the dissolution of carbonate and sulfate minerals this ion ratio was about 1 from 1990 to 2004 and showed an upward trend after 2005 fig 7 the new flow path is conducive to the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the concentration of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater increases which leads to an increase in groundwater hardness zhang et al 2017 the strong extraction of groundwater makes the alternating circulation of groundwater intensify and the water rock action is strengthened the dissolution of soluble salt in aquifer is accelerated by dissolution and filtration which results in the increase of groundwater salinity xing 2017 as a result the hydrochemical type of groundwater in hohhot has changed from ca mg hco3 to ca na mg hco3 so4 urbanization will inevitably lead to an increase in population and the development of industrialization the discharge of domestic sewage garbage and industrial wastewater aggravates the risk of groundwater pollution from 1990 to 2017 the arable land area in hohhot was decreasing while the application of chemical fertilizer was increasing therefore the application of chemical fertilizer per unit area of arable land increases year by year which has formed a situation of transitional use of chemical fertilizer with the decrease in the groundwater level and the increase in the aeration zone thickness the saturated stratum becomes the aeration zone the oxidation is strengthened which is beneficial to the formation of some pollutants for example ammonia is converted to nitrate as shown below simultaneously the drop in groundwater level also leads to a change in groundwater dynamic conditions increases the hydraulic gradient accelerates the migration and infiltration of pollutants in surface water and soil and causes groundwater pollution overexploitation of groundwater can also lead to cross pollution of different aquifers since the change of groundwater level leads to the overflow recharge between different aquifers 2 n h 4 3 o 2 nitritebacteria 2 n o 2 2 h 2 o 4 h 2 n o 2 3 o 2 nitrifyingbacteria 2 n o 3 finally the expansion of the city changes the original land use and the proportion of impervious area such as urban buildings and road increases the impervious underlying surface changes the original hydrological cycle reduces the recharge of precipitation and surface runoff to groundwater and increases the negative effect of urbanization on the groundwater environment barron et al 2013 4 2 influence of urbanization on groundwater level and quality during urbanization the population increases year by year the built up area gradually increases the groundwater exploitation increases and the groundwater level decreases under the dual influence of natural conditions and human activities the dynamic conditions of groundwater have considerably changed the original water rock balance is broken and the hydrochemical field is altered in addition the pollutants produced by human activities directly or indirectly act on the groundwater and threaten regional groundwater quality table 1 shows that except for ph and hco3 the main ion composition of groundwater comprehensive indicators of water quality and groundwater level are significantly or extremely significantly correlated with indicators of the urbanization process such as social economy and population in recent years gdp and population in hohhot have grown rapidly the total amounts of industrial wastewater domestic sewage and solid waste have increased significantly the treatment facilities of sewage and solid waste remain backward the discharge of domestic and industrial sewage is not up to standard and the treatment of solid waste also poses a challenge additionally in order to increase crop yield the use of chemical fertilizer is increasing which poses a threat to groundwater quality the contents of cl so4 2 and no3 are important indicators to reflect the influence of human activities on groundwater quality martín del campo et al 2014 table 1 shows that cl so4 2 and no3 are moderately correlated with indicators that characterize the urbanization process fig 6 with the development of urbanization cl so4 2 and no3 show an increasing trend indicating that anthropogenic activities have a major impact on groundwater quality the groundwater level and socioeconomic development of hohhot were highly negatively correlated with population growth table 1 which indicates that urbanization leads directly to the decline of groundwater level the decline of the groundwater level indirectly affects the quality of groundwater as shown in fig 6 and table 1 the groundwater level decreases with the development of urbanization whereas groundwater hardness and salinity increase year by year this is because the groundwater level drops under the excessive exploitation of groundwater which changes the original reduction environment into an oxidation environment and increases the recharge distance of infiltration the new recharge path contributes to the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the leaching of soluble salts in aquifers and increased groundwater hardness and salinity moreover as shown in table 2 groundwater hardness is highly correlated with the ca2 mg2 and hco3 contents and salinity is highly correlated with the ca2 and hco3 contents and moderately correlated with the mg2 k na cl and no3 contents again the increases in groundwater hardness and salinity are affected by groundwater overexploitation and environmental pollution 4 3 driving mechanism of groundwater environment degradation the degradation of the groundwater environment is affected by many factors pca is a powerful technique to reveal the relationship between geochemical variables and urbanization indexes by reducing the dimensions of a large number of parameters pca was used to find out the main factors causing the deterioration of groundwater environment zhang et al 2019 as shown in table 3 pca reduced the original 23 variables to three key independent factors three principal components with eigenvalues greater than 1 were retained accounting for 83 27 of the total variance as shown in table 3 pc1 accounted for 60 28 of the total variance has strong negative loading on groundwater level strong positive loading on mg2 content k content na content gdp pigdp sigdp tigdp pgdp cl pp urbanization and acfa and a medium positive loading on cl content hardness and salinity gdp pigdp sigdp tigdp pp and urbanization are indicators reflecting social and economic development and population growth social and economic development and population growth consume considerable groundwater resources producing a lot of wastewater changing the groundwater environment and causing the deterioration of groundwater quality therefore social and economic development and population growth can be regarded as the driving factors of groundwater level decline and water quality deterioration pc2 accounted for 16 31 of the total variance and had moderate positive loading on ca2 content hco3 content hardness and salinity these indexes are mainly related to water rock interaction and leaching huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in the process of urbanization in hohhot the exploitation of groundwater resources leads to the decrease in the water level and the increasing thickness of the aeration zone the hydrochemical environment and hydrodynamic conditions changed which enhanced the water rock interaction and leaching therefore pc2 was regarded as the driving force of groundwater quality deterioration pc3 accounted for 6 68 of the total variance with strong positive loading on the no3 content salinity pp and urbanization and medium positive loading on the k content na content and acfa pp and urbanization are the key indicators reflecting the growth of the social population population growth directly leads to an increase in domestic sewage and solid waste discharge at the same time fertilizer application continues to increase in order to increase crop yield these pollutants inevitably pose a threat to groundwater quality therefore pc3 can be regarded as groundwater pollution caused by population and chemical fertilizer application based on the analysis of aquifer structure and sediment characteristics a conceptual model of groundwater environment deterioration in the process of urbanization in hohhot is summarized fig 8 it can be seen that the groundwater flow pattern changes from the piedmont to the plain the driving force of groundwater environment deterioration in hohhot is classified as the comprehensive reflection of the following factors groundwater level drop caused by artificial mining water rock interaction and mineral dissolution irrigation infiltration including rivers and canals caused by artificial mining etc this conceptual model has certain reference value for the analysis of groundwater environment deterioration mechanism in the process of urbanization all over the world 5 conclusion in this study hohhot the capital city of western china was selected as a representative city to assess the impact of urbanization on the groundwater environment of the region the analysis was based on data of water quality monitoring wells the monitoring data of groundwater level and the statistical data of social economy and rural development provided by the hohhot bureau of statistics from 1990 to 2007 with the development of urbanization groundwater exploitation is intense and the water level continues to decline the piedmont phreatic water level in the urban area was closely related to the confined water in the plain area and the dynamic trend of the water level was consistent showing an approximate linear decline from 1990 to 2017 the piedmont phreatic water level and the confined water level decreased by 34 98 and 28 08 m respectively the shallow water level in the plain area dropped sharply in 2005 and had dropped by 12 02 m by 2014 moreover the decline rate of groundwater level varied among the different stages of urbanization under the intensive exploitation of groundwater the thickness of the aeration zone increased and the reduction environment changed to an oxidation environment leading to changes in the groundwater dynamic field and hydrochemical field the hydrochemical type of groundwater changed from ca mg hco3 to ca na mg hco3 so4 the variability and complexity increased and the groundwater was subjected to salinization and hardening moreover the groundwater quality deteriorated significantly and the hardness and no3 content exceeded the limits of the grade iii national quality standard for groundwater in 2005 and 2006 respectively the cl so4 2 and no3 contents are easily affected by human activities and have shown a fluctuating increase moreover water level ca2 content mg2 content so4 2 content and hardness are highly correlated with the urbanization development index the pca attributed the deterioration of groundwater environment to social and economic development population growth groundwater overexploitation and chemical fertilizer application national and local governments should propose environmental management measures according to the actual situation to better realize the sustainable development of the social economy and resources and to reduce environmental damage credit

3932,this study presents a decision support method that can quantify the effects of water management practices on surface water and groundwater systems using a basin scale fully integrated model for improvement to the decision making process the integrated model consists of evapotranspiration surface and subsurface hydrologic conditions and accounts for anthropogenic water management such as groundwater pumping and dam and weir operations which significantly affect the water resources of the geum river basin south korea in this study the fully integrated model is calibrated based on a step wise calibration approach for a reliable decision support model the calibrated model was further evaluated against five year monthly transient agricultural pumping and control structure operation data with taking into account the parametric uncertainty of the model the calibration and evaluation results agree well with various observation datasets including watertable depths surface flow reservoir water depths and dam and weir discharge rates simulation results reveal that annual average net precipitation ratio for the simulation period is 0 32 with a range from 0 12 to 0 40 which is a water surplus condition within each year however negative net precipitation ratios or water deficit conditions occur consistently during the dry seasons indicating that the hydrologic systems in the basin may be vulnerable during the dry seasons groundwater pumping within the basin lowers the local groundwater levels an average of 0 52 m over five years in the downstream area of the basin groundwater pumping activities affect approximately 30 of the area and result in a reduction of groundwater levels by 0 4 m with an acceptable range of uncertainty as a decision support method for weir operations we apply a weir removal scenario to evaluate the changes in surface flow conditions the simulation results reveal that surface flow rates in weir reservoirs increase by three orders of magnitudes and surface water depths in the reservoirs of the dams and weirs reduce by two to four times compared to a case where all the weirs are in operation therefore appropriate weir removal plans are necessary to minimize the impact on the ecosystem of the geum river keywords geum river basin integrated hydrologic model groundwater pumping dam operations surface water groundwater interactions groundwater contribution decision support method 1 introduction anthropogenic activities may alter natural hydrological systems and as a result may threaten ecosystem health and sustainability the impact of anthropogenic activity on water resources is of considerable interest to water resource managers industry and the public the evaluation of anthropogenic impacts on surface water and groundwater systems necessitate accounting for various aspects during environmental assessments including hydrologic ecologic and climatic system panday et al 2009 condon and maxwell 2013 davison et al 2015 gorelick and zheng 2015 in order to construct policies for sustaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies a quantitative understanding of the multi physical processes governing potential anthropogenic impacts on water flow and solute transport in integrated groundwater and surface water systems is essential panday et al 2009 fatichi et al 2016 erler et al 2019a b chen et al 2020 simmons et al 2020 xu et al 2021 various water management tools combined with integrated groundwater and surface water simulators have been developed to improve decision making for example as described in hwang et al 2019a b integrated water management tools include modhms with a water supply system module panday et al 2009 parflow with a water management optimization solver condon and maxwell 2013 the modflow farm process module hanson et al 2010 hanson et al 2012 and hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty inc 2019 combined with oasis operation analysis and simulation of integrated systems brookfield et al 2016 brookfield and gnau 2016 recently hgs has been used for various water management applications including tile drainage networks frey et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 dam operations valerio et al 2010 brookfield and gnau 2016 and complex water supply and demand networks hwang et al 2019a b overall these studies aim to support decision making processes on water resources systems using integrated surface subsurface models to our knowledge however this study is one of the first to provide a basin scale integrated modeling framework for decision support systems that consider anthropogenic impacts on the surface and groundwater system the calibration and uncertainty analysis methods applied in this study are relevant for other studies which need to handle complex hydrologic hydrogeologic conditions in an integrated model and need to provide reliable predictive information for water management and decision making in addition this study considers multi weir operation scenarios with predictive uncertainties to assess the cumulative impact of anthropogenic activities which can to more confidence in determining water management policies regarding water management in south korea the four major rivers restoration project was carried out to enhance the management of water quantity and quality on the han nakdong yeongsan and geum rivers in south korea from 2009 to 2012 shin and chung 2011 specifically the main objectives of the project were to improve water security by restoring riverbeds to promote flood and drought control management by installing dams and weirs and thereby to enrich aquatic ecosystems by reducing biological oxygen demand recently the k water performed experiments on the effects of weir opening on the water quality in the geum river and reported that the water quality of the river was improved moe 2019 for this reason using various numerical tools for decision support several studies have been performed to analyze the effects of hydraulic structures and anthropogenic activities on the groundwater and surface water systems in the geum river basin grb ahn et al 2014 and ahn et al 2018 estimated the river flow variations affected by the control structures used for supporting the water management applications to the grb they used hec recsim klipsch and hurst 2007 for simulating the dam and weir operations and global environmental flow calculator gefc and streamflow synthesis and reservoir regulation ssarr for analyzing the environmental impacts of the hydraulic structure operations kim et al 2016 used soil and water assessment tool swat to investigate the influence of the weirs in the grb on the surface flow conditions in mid and end century periods the operations of the weirs were simulated using a reservoir factor in swat together with including land cover and soil texture information into their surface flow model similarly lee et al 2019 investigated climate change impacts on groundwater levels in the grb using swat in the basin scale groundwater flow model used in the study surface water e g runoff and reservoir storage and evapotranspiration e g soil evaporation components in swat were considered for quantifying the groundwater level changes ahn et al 2016 analyzed climate change impacts on agricultural water management in the grb using swat combined with modsim modified simyld a water balance network analysis model shafer 1979 for groundwater flow simulations in the grb lee et al 2020 estimated the effects of weir operation on the interactions between the groundwater and surface water systems using visual modflow because visual modflow is a groundwater only flow simulator constant head boundary conditions were used for representing the river level changes in order to estimate the surface water and groundwater interactions in the downstream area baekje weir of the grb however rarely have there been investigations of the anthropogenic impacts on groundwater and surface water systems using a basin scale integrated approach that accounts simultaneously for dam and weir operations and intensive agricultural irrigations as well as the seasonal variability of atmospheric conditions such as rainfall and evapotranspiration in order to inform sustainable water resources management for effective decision making this study investigates the effects of anthropogenic activities on the entire groundwater and surface water system within the grb using a fully integrated modelling approach the specific objectives of this study are 1 to develop and calibrate a fully integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model of the grb using hgs 2 to assess basin scale groundwater surface water interactions and 3 to analyze the effects of the groundwater pumping and weir operations on groundwater and surface water systems for the weir removal scenarios while taking into account predictive model uncertainty analyses the main outcomes of this study will be helpful for decision support by identifying the main factors controlling the integrated flow system and key information to establish integrated groundwater surface quantity and quality management plans in response to projected policy change in addition the methodology demonstrated in this study can also provide a basis for further developing integrated water resources system models and quantifying the dynamic interactions of groundwater surface water resources affected by anthropogenic activities in other river basins 2 method 2 1 geum river basin model the grb one of four major basins in south korea covers approximately 10 000 km2 fig 1 like other basins in the korean peninsula the hydrologic conditions of the basin are highly affected by the monsoon climate which brings about 60 to 70 of the annual precipitation during the wet season june to september ha et al 2012 seo et al 2015 for this reason variation in monthly precipitation is greater than annual mean precipitation the annual mean total precipitation from 2001 to 2017 in the grb is about 1300 mm y with a standard deviation of 1469 mm y the monthly mean temperature ranges from 2 3 to 25 1 c with an annual mean temperature of 12 1 c since relatively warm weather occurs during the fall and winter snowmelt contribution to the hydrologic system is very minor compared to the amount of the liquid precipitation the geology of the grb is composed of four main formations precambrian bedrock jurassic granites cretaceous sedimentary rocks and quaternary alluvium deposits lee and kwon 2016 the basement rocks of the basin consist of precambrian gneiss and cretaceous granites cheong et al 2003 precambrian gneiss generally resistant to weathering is dominantly distributed in the upstream while weathered cretaceous granites are found in the mid and downstream portions of the grb overlying the bedrock quaternary alluvium originating from the okcheon fold belt is found along most streams and riparian zones in the grb choi et al 2016 for most of its length the geum river the mainstem of the grb flows from south to southwest and has a length of 344 km the hydraulic gradient of the river is approximately 1 2 10 3 with the upstream and downstream elevations of the river being 420 m a s l meters above sea level and 5 m a s l respectively the grb is highly affected by anthropogenic activities including surface water control systems in addition to agricultural irrigation there are five main surface water management structures along the geum river the yongdam and daecheong dams and the sejong gongju and baekje weirs fig 1 the yongdam and daecheong dams were constructed in the upper and middle regions of the grb to supply water for municipal and industrial use in the downstream area of the grb three weirs were constructed throughout the four major rivers restoration project which aimed to improve the riverine environment with five main objectives flood control water security water quality aquatic ecosystem restoration and water front development ahn et al 2014 additionally groundwater is the main water source for agricultural activities in the grb and thereby groundwater pumping is intensive for crop production activities groundwater extraction occurs year round due to agricultural activities which use groundwater for irrigating crops during the production season april to october and for warming greenhouses through water curtain systems during the winter season november to march kwon et al 2020 lee et al 2020 accordingly groundwater consumption in this basin is consistently high over the entire year in some cases the groundwater pumping wells located near the streams in the basin may induce losing stream conditions during the dry season and cause groundwater contamination through surface water infiltration krause et al 2008 2 1 1 two dimensional surface flow and evapotranspiration models the two dimensional 2d surface flow model of the grb was discretized using algomesh merrick 2015 the surface model consists of 166 010 triangle elements and 83 741 nodes the total area of the surface flow domain is approximately 10 000 km2 and the average element size is approximately 0 06 km2 fig 2 a there are about 200 branches black lines in fig 2a flowing into the geum river red line in fig 2a because datasets describing the stream bed elevation and reservoir bathymetry were not available elevations along the stream were adjusted to conform to the average slope 1 2 10 3 of the basin the spatial distribution of the land cover use types in the grb is shown in fig 2b there are a total of seven types 1 urban 2 croplands 3 forest 4 shrublands 5 wetland 6 barren rock and 7 water forest is the dominant land cover type in the simulation domain and both forest and croplands cover approximately 90 of the grb table 1 table 1 lists the initial parameters describing the land cover use types ascribed to the grb surface flow model the parameter values for urban croplands and forest zones were initially assigned based on the study of hwang et al 2020 who investigated surface flow under similar land cover conditions other parameter values were initially assigned according to mccuen 1989 it is noted that in order to reduce the computational cost and complexity during model calibration only the most important sensitive parameters such as the roughness coefficients for the urban croplands and water zones were included in the calibration process to fit the observation data in hgs the actual evapotranspiration aet is computed using an evapotranspiration et model suggested by kristensen and jensen 1975 the details of the et process are presented in aquanty inc 2019 for the et calculations in the grb model the et zones were assigned based on land use cover types such that all et zones are identical to the surface flow zones of the grb model fig 2b table 2 summarizes et zone properties used for the grb simulations similar to the surface model there are a total of seven et zones among which the forest and crop areas are dominant in other words the et zones of the forest and crop areas are the main sinks affecting the water balance of the grb the et properties of these zones were obtained through the calibration process for the seasonality of the et parameterization the monthly normal or mean monthly leaf area index lai for each et zone was used based on the study conducted by park et al 2013 2 1 2 three dimensional subsurface model using geologic information from borehole logging a three dimensional 3d subsurface domain was constructed with four main material types competent bedrock weathered rock unconsolidated deposits and topsoil fig 3 the bottom elevation of the bedrock layer was assigned at 70 m a s l and the top surface elevation of the model was assigned using the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m digital elevation model farr et al 2007 the bedrock layer with a thickness ranging from 4 to 195 m was assigned as the bottom of the subsurface domain the weathered rock layer with an average thickness of 13 m was placed above the bedrock layer the unconsolidated layer lying on top of the weathered rock was assigned below the topsoil layer and its thickness ranges from 1 to 36 m calibrated subsurface zone properties used in the simulations are listed in table 3 anisotropic hydraulic conductivity values were assigned to the consolidated and unconsolidated rocks which are underlain by the topsoil layers the ratios of horizontal kx ky to vertical kz hydraulic conductivities for the rock types range from 4 to 13 isotropic conditions however were assigned to the topsoil layers lee et al 2020 except for the bedrock the hydraulic conductivities for all of the zones were adjusted in the model calibration process the porosity and specific storage parameters were assigned based on previous studies park et al 2013 moe 2019 2 2 model calibration the model calibration was focused using monthly normal or mean conditions for each month of the year i e average january conditions from 2013 to 2017 average february conditions from 2013 to 2017 etc these monthly normal conditions represent the average annual cycle of hydrologic hydrogeologic conditions within the basin as discussed in erler et al 2019a b because fully transient simulations are difficult to track and time consuming simulations with monthly normal forcing are a compromise between fully transient and steady state conditions by using a representative seasonal cycle based on mean monthly hydrologic conditions according to xu et al 2021 simulations with the monthly normal forcing can provide seasonal variability over an average annual cycle for these reasons the model calibration with the monthly normal forcing can be a cost effective approach the time period considered for model calibration in this study is from 2013 to 2017 as such it only reflects the period after the construction of the three weirs i e sejong gongju and baekje weirs in the downstream region of the grb the calibration targets consist of groundwater level measurements stream flow observations and surface water discharge rates and water depths measured at the dam and weir reservoirs details of the model calibration are provided in supporting information 2 3 monthly average transient simulation in order to evaluate calibrated model performance the grb model was further simulated using monthly average transient conditions the simulation period is five years from january 2013 to december 2017 during which the groundwater and surface water systems were affected by the operation of three weirs in the downstream areas the groundwater and surface water heads obtained from the model calibration were assigned as initial conditions for the monthly transient simulations the boundary conditions including assigned fluxes and critical depth outflow locations were the same as those applied to the monthly normal model calibration for the climate forcing data the monthly average total liquid precipitation was assigned to the surface flow domain additionally the potential evapotranspiration pet provided by the korea meteorological administration was also applied to the evapotranspiration domain 2 4 uncertainty analysis since the fully integrated grb model has many parameters that need to be estimated the uncertainty of the calibrated model needs to be investigated to assess the reliability of the predications for water management and decision making issues in this study we evaluated the uncertainty of the predictive simulations on weir operation scenarios based on a linearized uncertainty model based on a bayesian approach christensen and doherty 2008 doherty et al 2010 1 σ p 2 z t c p z z t c p j t j c p j t c ε 1 j c p z where σ p 2 represents the predictive uncertainty variance of parameter p z is the predictive sensitivity vector j is the jacobian matrix with respect to p c p is the precalibration covariance matrices and c ε is the observation errors with the estimated uncertainty of the model parameters we evaluated the predictive uncertainty of the river flow and reservoir depths under weir operation scenarios latin hypercube sampling lhs was used to generate uniformly distributed random samples from equally probable parameter combinations mckay et al 2000 the lhs method is implemented in the hydrogeosphere uncertainty quantification tool hgsuq aquanty inc 2017 miller et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance the model calibration was performed based on the monthly normal surface water and groundwater conditions the performance of the calibrated model was further evaluated under the monthly transient conditions the results of the calibrated model performance are detailed in supporting information briefly the calibrated model can reproduce the spatiotemporal behavior of the integrated flow system with an acceptable range of simulation error but groundwater table near the tributaries and surface flow during the high flow seasons were consistently underestimated due to the relatively low mesh resolution of the model 3 2 characteristics of integrated flow system 3 2 1 subsurface flow system the spatial distribution of the annual average depth to the water table is shown in fig 4 a the sub basins upstream of the daecheong dam shown in fig 4a are mostly mountainous and are characterized by a relatively deep groundwater system of which groundwater depths to the water table range from 10 to 50 m in fig 4b the standard deviations of the depth to the water table in the upstream region are greater than 0 5 m while those in the downstream area below the daecheong dam are less than 0 1 m in agricultural fields located in the relatively low relief areas of the downstream region the mean depth to the water table is typically less than 1 0 m σ 0 05 due mainly to groundwater inflow from surrounding regions at higher elevations the simulated groundwater table is slightly lowered by the pumping wells in highland areas the overall pumping effects on the groundwater system appear to be less important because the total pumping rate estimated during the simulation period is approximately 1 84 109 m3 which is about 17 of the total precipitation however because the groundwater pumping in this area occurs year round the amount of the groundwater extraction is about 52 of the average net precipitation it may be more significant during the dry periods when the net precipitation is negative the spatial changes in the water table depths are relatively large due to the topographic relief additionally the standard deviation of the water table depths at the pumping wells ranges from 0 01 near the surface m to 0 5 m in the deep aquifer indicating that the groundwater table of the deep aquifer is more affected by the groundwater pumping 3 2 2 evapotranspiration the simulated annual mean aet during the five year period ranges from approximately 400 to 1 100 mm y fig 5 a for the annual changes in aet the standard deviation σ of the simulated aet ranges from 60 to 200 mm y fig 5b the mean aet over the basin is 750 mm y σ 98 the annual variations of aet tend to be proportional to the aet magnitudes specifically because aet is dependent on the water table depth or soil saturations the minimum aet occurs mainly in areas where the water table is relatively deep which can be affected by natural and anthropogenic factors the natural factors include topographic relief and underlying subsurface material properties in this case minimum aet occurs mainly in the highlands where the depth to the water table is deeper than 3 m for the anthropogenic factors they occur mainly in the groundwater pumping areas where many wells are highly clustered however it is worth noting that the pumped water is being used for irrigation purpose and thus the simulated aet in these areas can be closer to pet in reality indicating possible limitations in this model on the other hand the maximum aet occurs mainly where there is high evaporation from the dam reservoirs and evapotranspiration from the groundwater discharge areas where the topsoil layer is close to saturation spatially there are slight changes in the areal mean aet between the upstream and downstream portions of the basin the mean aet is 763 mm y in the upstream area of the yongdam dam which is slightly great than the mid 751 mm y and downstream 747 mm y areas the minor changes in the areal mean aet are mainly derived from the characteristics of the land cover types the forest and croplands cover approximately 90 of the basin and the croplands 30 are primarily located in the downstream area regarding the land cover types the mean aet in the forest areas ranges from 700 to 760 mm y which is similar to the areal average in the crop areas located in upstream of the sejong weir and downstream of the baekje weir the simulated mean aet ranges from 800 to 850 mm y which is higher than the overall mean aet because of the relatively shallow groundwater table compared to upstream areas 3 2 3 surface water groundwater interactions the annual mean and standard deviation of the simulated exchange flux are plotted in fig 6 a and b respectively for the annual mean exchange flux there are two components infiltration shown in blue and represented by negative values and exfiltration shown in red and represented by positive values fig 6a dark colors represent greater magnitudes based on the characteristics of the spatial distribution of the exchange flux exfiltration fluxes or groundwater seepage ranging from 100 to 2000 mm y tend to be slightly dominant along the streams while groundwater infiltration fluxes ranging from 100 to 2000 mm y are strongly dominant in the mountainous and highland areas where the groundwater table is relatively deep the overall basin averaged infiltration and exfiltration rates are 1280 mm y and 1050 mm y respectively note that the infiltration flux used in this analysis is not necessarily groundwater recharge because infiltrated water can be taken up by subsurface evaporation and transpiration the magnitude of the mean infiltration rate is about 22 greater than that of the exfiltration rate the standard deviation of the exchange flux over the basin is approximately 70 mm y fig 6b in the upstream area the mean infiltration and exfiltration rates in the yongdam dam area are 1120 mm y and 610 mm y respectively the standard deviations of both infiltration and exfiltration are less than 100 mm y fig 6b the mean infiltration is about two times greater than the mean exfiltration because of the relatively high mountainous terrains in the midstream area the mean exfiltration increases to 2020 mm y while the mean infiltration in this subbasin is 1460 mm y which is about 30 greater than that in the upstream region the standard deviation of the exchange flux in this area is 74 mm y fig 6b the mean infiltration in the downstream area is about 13 less than the basin averaged infiltration which is also lower than those in the upstream and midstream areas additionally the mean exfiltration in this area is about 42 less than the basin averaged exfiltration the relatively large decrease in the mean infiltration and exfiltration is due to the presence of the large crop fields where the groundwater depths are shallow and thus the exchange fluxes are almost balanced or less than 150 mm y 3 3 water balance analysis 3 3 1 net precipitation the temporal changes in total precipitation positive values blue and aet negative values red over the basin from 2013 to 2017 are shown in fig 7 net precipitation green was also estimated by calculating the difference between the total precipitation and aet rates the overall average rates of total precipitation and aet are 347 and 236 m3 s respectively the average net precipitation is 111 m3 s with a net precipitation ratio of 0 32 which is similar to 0 29 estimated by hwang et al 2020 for a watershed in wonju located less than 100 km from the grb the temporal variation of the net precipitation is significant from year to year ranging from 30 m3 s 97 mm y in 2015 to 269 m3 s 857 mm y in 2017 it is noted that each year has water deficit conditions in which the net precipitation is below zero because aet exceeds precipitation water deficit conditions occur during the april june and september october periods on the other hand maximum water surplus conditions occur mainly during the july august period the annual net precipitation in 2013 2014 and 2016 fall within a similar range with a difference of less than 40 of the average net precipitation while those in 2015 and 2017 are about 73 lower and 150 greater than the average net precipitation respectively based on the water balance results a relatively strong dry condition occurred in 2015 with a net precipitation ratio of 0 12 the annual net precipitation ratio in 2017 is 0 35 which is similar to the average over the simulation period both strong dry and wet conditions however occur in 2017 due mainly to relatively high precipitation and aet 3 3 2 groundwater seepage contributions groundwater seepage and surface flow rates along the geum river were estimated using the simulated groundwater exfiltration seepage fluxes fig 8 shows the comparison of groundwater seepage red and surface flow rates blue along the geum river the dark shaded areas represent the standard deviation of the flow rates overall both flow rates gradually increase from the headwater 0 km to the outlet 334 km of the river it is noted that the stream flows in the dam and weir reservoirs are not included in the stream flow plots in fig 8 for better visualization of the stream flow trends additionally the step changes in the stream flow and groundwater seepage rates along the geum river corresponds to the contributions of the inflows from its tributaries fig 8a shows the comparison between river blue and groundwater seepage flow rates red during the dry seasons over the simulation period the river flow at the outlet ranges from 52 3 166 7 mm y to 172 8 m3 s 550 8 mm y with a mean of 111 7 m3 s 356 0 mm y σ 28 2 the mean groundwater seepage rate upstream of the outlet is 32 5 m3 s 103 6 mm y σ 2 8 which is 29 1 of the mean river flow the stream flow drastically increases at about 229 km where the miho river one of the main tributaries joins to the geum river the mean groundwater contribution to the geum river during the wet season decreases to 17 7 because the mean stream flow increases by a factor of 1 5 but the mean groundwater seepage is more or less similar to that of the dry season fig 8b in addition the standard deviation and minimum and maximum seepage rates at the outlet also fall in similar ranges which indicates that the groundwater seepage rates are not sensitive to seasonal hydrologic conditions fig 8c shows the annual mean flow conditions over the simulation period the annual mean river flow and groundwater seepage at the outlet are 131 3 m3 s 418 5 mm y σ 66 7 and 31 7 m3 s 101 0 mm y σ 3 1 m3 s respectively of which the mean groundwater contribution is 24 2 the groundwater seepage contribution to the river flow varies from 10 in upstream of the yongdam dam to 34 in midstream near the daecheong dam with an overall standard deviation of 10 3 4 decision support model with parametric uncertainty for a reliable decision support model it is important to consider model uncertainty due to various limitations inherent in a calibrated model such as non uniqueness issues lack of observation dataset and assumptions about model structure schoups et al 2006 delottier et al 2017 in this study because the grb is highly affected by anthropogenic activities and water management policies a reliable assessment of the water management impact in the grb is essential therefore an ensemble of 15 uncertainty runs obtained from lhs was performed for assessing the impact of current and future water management activities in the grb specifically the effect of groundwater pumping and weir operations on surface water and groundwater conditions were evaluated using the monthly transient model base case first groundwater pumping effects on the groundwater system of the grb were estimated by comparing the base case simulation results with a simulation case where there is no groundwater pumping occurred in the basin second a simulation with a weir removal scenario was performed to evaluate the effect of weir dismantling on surface flow conditions by comparing the results to the base case simulation 3 4 1 parameter uncertainty to reduce the computing effort only parameters with relatively high sensitivities were selected and their corresponding σ p 2 values were applied to generate simulation parameter sets using lhs as listed in table 4 the parameters used for the uncertainty analysis are the main parameters in the subsurface surface and evapotranspiration domains the subsurface parameters correspond to the hydraulic conductivities of the topsoil and unconsolidated rock layers which affect shallow groundwater levels and exchange fluxes the surface model parameters used in the uncertainty analysis are the manning s coefficients for water forest and cropland which are dominant in the grb surface model similarly the field capacity and oxic limits of the forest and cropland zones in the evapotranspiration domain were included for the uncertainty analysis the 95 confidence interval of each parameter was computed from its mean or calibrated value and predictive uncertainty standard deviation σ p the 95 confidence intervals for the parameters are mostly within one order of magnitude range the maximum difference between the calibrated parameter value and the 95 confidence interval is 5 5 which indicates that the uncertainty of the calibrated model is small and thus the simulation results are acceptable based on the number of parameter sets obtained from lhs a total of 15 runs were performed to evaluate the predictive uncertainty of the grb model on water management or decisions 3 4 2 groundwater pumping effect to evaluate the groundwater pumping impact on the groundwater system within the basin we performed a simulation case with no groundwater pumping in the grb the effect of groundwater pumping was evaluated by subtracting the results of the groundwater pumping case base case from the results of a simulation without pumping the groundwater pumping rates applied to the monthly average transient simulation are based on the calibration results the calibrated annual average pumping rate over the basin is approximately 3 68 108 m3 y which is about 24 less than that reported during the simulation period see section s1 1 3 in the supporting information however it is noted that there may be a large difference between the reported and actual groundwater pumping rates because the reported annual average pumping rate was calculated based on the maximum pumping rate of each well that was reported for obtaining permission from the government kim et al 2013 in the calculation the changes in the annual mean depth to the water table was used as the measure all other conditions such as initial and boundary conditions are the same as those assigned for the base case fig 9 shows the impact of the groundwater pumping in the basin on the depth to the water table and the groundwater seepage rates the spatial distribution of the watertable decline caused by the agricultural pumping shows that the drawdown area is mainly concentrated in the mid and downstream regions of the grb fig 9a overall the annual average watertable decline due to pumping is less than 20 m and there is almost no decline in the upstream areas such as near wg01 wg02 and wg03 where the average water level decline is less than 0 01 m in the midstream areas such as near wg05 wg06 wg07 and wg08 the average watertable decline ranges from 0 3 wg05 to 1 5 m wg06 but the groundwater pumping effects are relatively minor because the groundwater decline area covers less than 10 of each total wg area in the downstream areas from wg10 to wg14 the average decrease in the depth to the water table ranges from 0 36 to 0 74 m the area of watertable decline covers between 21 and 51 of each total area specifically the wg13 and wg14 areas are significantly affected by the groundwater pumping with a watertable decline area of 45 for wg13 and 51 for wg14 fig 9a groundwater seepage along the geum river for the no pumping case was calculated to quantify the impact of pumping on the groundwater contribution to the streams as shown in fig 9b from the upstream to the downstream portion near the sejong weir 240 km from origin there is almost no difference between two cases in the downstream of the sejong weir the average seepage rate for the base case is slightly lower than the no pumping case all the seepage rates including average minimum and maximum are linearly decreased by the groundwater pumping at the outlet of the river the difference in the average seepage rate between two cases is about 0 8 m3 s which is 2 4 of the total seepage rate for the no pumping case additionally the groundwater seepage is reduced by 3 0 by the groundwater pumping during the low flow seasons although the effect of the groundwater pumping is relatively minor excessive pumping activities in the downstream areas may cause significant drawdown and reduced groundwater seepage in the rivers during extreme water deficit conditions 3 4 3 weir removal scenario in order to assess the impact of removing weirs in the grb a weir removal scenario was performed while accounting for model uncertainty in this case three weirs the sejong gongju and baekje weirs were excluded from the base case monthly transient model all other numerical inputs including the initial and boundary conditions are the same as those of the base case using the simulated surface flow rates and reservoir depths at the weirs we analyzed the impact of removing the control structures on the surface flow system in the downstream area fig 10 shows the comparison of the surface flow rates and water depths in the weir reservoirs between the weir removal scenario lines with symbols and the base case lines without symbols the solid lines represent average surface flows and water depths over all simulations performed for the uncertainty analysis and the dotted lines correspond to their minimum and maximum values the average stream flow rates computed at the weir reservoirs show a significant increase for the weir removal scenario fig 10a specifically the flow rates at the weir reservoirs are less than 0 5 m3 s during the weir operations because of the bottleneck effect in the reservoirs but all the stream flows for the weir removal scenario increase to approximately 100 m3 s which is more than three orders of magnitude higher than the base case results for the model uncertainty there are minor differences in the stream flow rates such that the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum stream flows is less than 0 1 m3 s for the base case and 10 m3 s for the weir removal case similar to the changes in the stream flow there are also significant changes in the reservoir water depth for the weir removal scenario fig 10b for the base case the average water depth at the weir reservoirs ranges from 2 3 m at the sejong weir to 4 2 m at the gongju weir for the weir removal scenario however the average reservoir water depth reduces to 0 7 m at the sejong weir and 1 3 m at the baekje weir which are about 2 to 4 times shallower than the base case results the model uncertainty associated with the surface water depths is also in an acceptable range with the maximum difference being less than 0 1 m for both cases overall the results suggest that there are significant changes in the downstream areas of the grb when the weirs are removed the changes in the stream flow rates and surface water depths may cause a chain of changes in riverine ecosystems surface water quality and surface water and groundwater interactions therefore it is necessary to consider appropriate weir removal plans that can mitigate the effect of the drastic changes in the surface flow regime 4 summary and conclusion sustainable water resources management requires a comprehensive understanding of an integrated hydrosystem consisting of multi physical components this study presents an integrated surface subsurface model of the geum river basin in south korea as a decision supporting method for surface water and groundwater management such as engineered hydrologic control structure operations and agricultural groundwater extractions the basin scale model was calibrated with various calibration targets such as monthly normal stream flow depth to the water table dam weir discharge rate and surface water depth at each reservoir because many parameters to be estimed and observations were included in the calibration process we used a stepwise calibration approach based on the model calibration results the spatiotemporal behavior of the surface flow and groundwater system was reproduced with an acceptable degree of accuracy however regarding the model limitations the subsurface model tended to underestimate water table close to the streams due to relatively low mesh resolutions near the branches of the geum river the calibrated integrated model was further simulated by driving it with the monthly transient atmospheric forcing and anthropogenic conditions over a five year period for which the observed data were not used for calibration the monthly transient simulation results demonstrated that the seasonal changes in groundwater levels and surface flow rates were reproduced well under complex groundwater pumping and dam weir operation conditions the analysis of the transient simulation results revealed that the water budget of the basin was balanced or slightly subject to water surplus conditions but water deficit conditions occurred consistently during the dry seasons over the simulation period additionally the groundwater seepage along the rivers within the basin was an important water source component that can sustain environmental flow under severe water deficit conditions for better support water management decision making we performed simulations with model uncertainty and estimated the impact of groundwater pumping and weir operation scenarios on the surface water and groundwater system in the grb groundwater pumping over the basin showed a significant influence on the groundwater system in the downstream portion of the basin where the annual mean watertable elevation decreased by up to 0 4 m with a standard deviation of 0 06 m consequently the groundwater discharge fluxes along the geum river were also reduced by the groundwater pumping in the downstream part of the basin although the amount of the reduction in the annual mean groundwater seepage was about 2 4 with a standard deviation of 0 05 the effect of the reduction was expected to be more significant during dry seasons due to the negative net precipitation causing water deficit conditions the weir removal scenario assuming that three weirs in the downstream area were dismantled was simulated to analyze its impact on the surface water system simulation results showed that the surface flow rates at the weir reservoirs increased by more than three orders of magnitudes and the reservoir water depths decreased by two to four times compared to those for the case with weir operation the model uncertainty associated with both the base and weir removal cases was less than 10 of the mean values and thus was in an acceptable range this indicates that the weir operations significantly impact the surface flow conditions and they also increase water residence times in the reservoirs therefore effective and comprehensive weir removal plans are necessary to avoid or minimize the impact of the drastic surface water changes on the ecosystem in the downstream areas of the grb with the numerical schemes used for assessing the anthropogenic effects the simulation results demonstrated that the integrated basin scale model can provide many useful insights on the factors affecting hydrologic processes within the basin from a gross water balance for the entire hydrologic system to detailed surface water and groundwater interactions affected by the anthropogenic activities the integrated modelling approach

3932,this study presents a decision support method that can quantify the effects of water management practices on surface water and groundwater systems using a basin scale fully integrated model for improvement to the decision making process the integrated model consists of evapotranspiration surface and subsurface hydrologic conditions and accounts for anthropogenic water management such as groundwater pumping and dam and weir operations which significantly affect the water resources of the geum river basin south korea in this study the fully integrated model is calibrated based on a step wise calibration approach for a reliable decision support model the calibrated model was further evaluated against five year monthly transient agricultural pumping and control structure operation data with taking into account the parametric uncertainty of the model the calibration and evaluation results agree well with various observation datasets including watertable depths surface flow reservoir water depths and dam and weir discharge rates simulation results reveal that annual average net precipitation ratio for the simulation period is 0 32 with a range from 0 12 to 0 40 which is a water surplus condition within each year however negative net precipitation ratios or water deficit conditions occur consistently during the dry seasons indicating that the hydrologic systems in the basin may be vulnerable during the dry seasons groundwater pumping within the basin lowers the local groundwater levels an average of 0 52 m over five years in the downstream area of the basin groundwater pumping activities affect approximately 30 of the area and result in a reduction of groundwater levels by 0 4 m with an acceptable range of uncertainty as a decision support method for weir operations we apply a weir removal scenario to evaluate the changes in surface flow conditions the simulation results reveal that surface flow rates in weir reservoirs increase by three orders of magnitudes and surface water depths in the reservoirs of the dams and weirs reduce by two to four times compared to a case where all the weirs are in operation therefore appropriate weir removal plans are necessary to minimize the impact on the ecosystem of the geum river keywords geum river basin integrated hydrologic model groundwater pumping dam operations surface water groundwater interactions groundwater contribution decision support method 1 introduction anthropogenic activities may alter natural hydrological systems and as a result may threaten ecosystem health and sustainability the impact of anthropogenic activity on water resources is of considerable interest to water resource managers industry and the public the evaluation of anthropogenic impacts on surface water and groundwater systems necessitate accounting for various aspects during environmental assessments including hydrologic ecologic and climatic system panday et al 2009 condon and maxwell 2013 davison et al 2015 gorelick and zheng 2015 in order to construct policies for sustaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies a quantitative understanding of the multi physical processes governing potential anthropogenic impacts on water flow and solute transport in integrated groundwater and surface water systems is essential panday et al 2009 fatichi et al 2016 erler et al 2019a b chen et al 2020 simmons et al 2020 xu et al 2021 various water management tools combined with integrated groundwater and surface water simulators have been developed to improve decision making for example as described in hwang et al 2019a b integrated water management tools include modhms with a water supply system module panday et al 2009 parflow with a water management optimization solver condon and maxwell 2013 the modflow farm process module hanson et al 2010 hanson et al 2012 and hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty inc 2019 combined with oasis operation analysis and simulation of integrated systems brookfield et al 2016 brookfield and gnau 2016 recently hgs has been used for various water management applications including tile drainage networks frey et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 dam operations valerio et al 2010 brookfield and gnau 2016 and complex water supply and demand networks hwang et al 2019a b overall these studies aim to support decision making processes on water resources systems using integrated surface subsurface models to our knowledge however this study is one of the first to provide a basin scale integrated modeling framework for decision support systems that consider anthropogenic impacts on the surface and groundwater system the calibration and uncertainty analysis methods applied in this study are relevant for other studies which need to handle complex hydrologic hydrogeologic conditions in an integrated model and need to provide reliable predictive information for water management and decision making in addition this study considers multi weir operation scenarios with predictive uncertainties to assess the cumulative impact of anthropogenic activities which can to more confidence in determining water management policies regarding water management in south korea the four major rivers restoration project was carried out to enhance the management of water quantity and quality on the han nakdong yeongsan and geum rivers in south korea from 2009 to 2012 shin and chung 2011 specifically the main objectives of the project were to improve water security by restoring riverbeds to promote flood and drought control management by installing dams and weirs and thereby to enrich aquatic ecosystems by reducing biological oxygen demand recently the k water performed experiments on the effects of weir opening on the water quality in the geum river and reported that the water quality of the river was improved moe 2019 for this reason using various numerical tools for decision support several studies have been performed to analyze the effects of hydraulic structures and anthropogenic activities on the groundwater and surface water systems in the geum river basin grb ahn et al 2014 and ahn et al 2018 estimated the river flow variations affected by the control structures used for supporting the water management applications to the grb they used hec recsim klipsch and hurst 2007 for simulating the dam and weir operations and global environmental flow calculator gefc and streamflow synthesis and reservoir regulation ssarr for analyzing the environmental impacts of the hydraulic structure operations kim et al 2016 used soil and water assessment tool swat to investigate the influence of the weirs in the grb on the surface flow conditions in mid and end century periods the operations of the weirs were simulated using a reservoir factor in swat together with including land cover and soil texture information into their surface flow model similarly lee et al 2019 investigated climate change impacts on groundwater levels in the grb using swat in the basin scale groundwater flow model used in the study surface water e g runoff and reservoir storage and evapotranspiration e g soil evaporation components in swat were considered for quantifying the groundwater level changes ahn et al 2016 analyzed climate change impacts on agricultural water management in the grb using swat combined with modsim modified simyld a water balance network analysis model shafer 1979 for groundwater flow simulations in the grb lee et al 2020 estimated the effects of weir operation on the interactions between the groundwater and surface water systems using visual modflow because visual modflow is a groundwater only flow simulator constant head boundary conditions were used for representing the river level changes in order to estimate the surface water and groundwater interactions in the downstream area baekje weir of the grb however rarely have there been investigations of the anthropogenic impacts on groundwater and surface water systems using a basin scale integrated approach that accounts simultaneously for dam and weir operations and intensive agricultural irrigations as well as the seasonal variability of atmospheric conditions such as rainfall and evapotranspiration in order to inform sustainable water resources management for effective decision making this study investigates the effects of anthropogenic activities on the entire groundwater and surface water system within the grb using a fully integrated modelling approach the specific objectives of this study are 1 to develop and calibrate a fully integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model of the grb using hgs 2 to assess basin scale groundwater surface water interactions and 3 to analyze the effects of the groundwater pumping and weir operations on groundwater and surface water systems for the weir removal scenarios while taking into account predictive model uncertainty analyses the main outcomes of this study will be helpful for decision support by identifying the main factors controlling the integrated flow system and key information to establish integrated groundwater surface quantity and quality management plans in response to projected policy change in addition the methodology demonstrated in this study can also provide a basis for further developing integrated water resources system models and quantifying the dynamic interactions of groundwater surface water resources affected by anthropogenic activities in other river basins 2 method 2 1 geum river basin model the grb one of four major basins in south korea covers approximately 10 000 km2 fig 1 like other basins in the korean peninsula the hydrologic conditions of the basin are highly affected by the monsoon climate which brings about 60 to 70 of the annual precipitation during the wet season june to september ha et al 2012 seo et al 2015 for this reason variation in monthly precipitation is greater than annual mean precipitation the annual mean total precipitation from 2001 to 2017 in the grb is about 1300 mm y with a standard deviation of 1469 mm y the monthly mean temperature ranges from 2 3 to 25 1 c with an annual mean temperature of 12 1 c since relatively warm weather occurs during the fall and winter snowmelt contribution to the hydrologic system is very minor compared to the amount of the liquid precipitation the geology of the grb is composed of four main formations precambrian bedrock jurassic granites cretaceous sedimentary rocks and quaternary alluvium deposits lee and kwon 2016 the basement rocks of the basin consist of precambrian gneiss and cretaceous granites cheong et al 2003 precambrian gneiss generally resistant to weathering is dominantly distributed in the upstream while weathered cretaceous granites are found in the mid and downstream portions of the grb overlying the bedrock quaternary alluvium originating from the okcheon fold belt is found along most streams and riparian zones in the grb choi et al 2016 for most of its length the geum river the mainstem of the grb flows from south to southwest and has a length of 344 km the hydraulic gradient of the river is approximately 1 2 10 3 with the upstream and downstream elevations of the river being 420 m a s l meters above sea level and 5 m a s l respectively the grb is highly affected by anthropogenic activities including surface water control systems in addition to agricultural irrigation there are five main surface water management structures along the geum river the yongdam and daecheong dams and the sejong gongju and baekje weirs fig 1 the yongdam and daecheong dams were constructed in the upper and middle regions of the grb to supply water for municipal and industrial use in the downstream area of the grb three weirs were constructed throughout the four major rivers restoration project which aimed to improve the riverine environment with five main objectives flood control water security water quality aquatic ecosystem restoration and water front development ahn et al 2014 additionally groundwater is the main water source for agricultural activities in the grb and thereby groundwater pumping is intensive for crop production activities groundwater extraction occurs year round due to agricultural activities which use groundwater for irrigating crops during the production season april to october and for warming greenhouses through water curtain systems during the winter season november to march kwon et al 2020 lee et al 2020 accordingly groundwater consumption in this basin is consistently high over the entire year in some cases the groundwater pumping wells located near the streams in the basin may induce losing stream conditions during the dry season and cause groundwater contamination through surface water infiltration krause et al 2008 2 1 1 two dimensional surface flow and evapotranspiration models the two dimensional 2d surface flow model of the grb was discretized using algomesh merrick 2015 the surface model consists of 166 010 triangle elements and 83 741 nodes the total area of the surface flow domain is approximately 10 000 km2 and the average element size is approximately 0 06 km2 fig 2 a there are about 200 branches black lines in fig 2a flowing into the geum river red line in fig 2a because datasets describing the stream bed elevation and reservoir bathymetry were not available elevations along the stream were adjusted to conform to the average slope 1 2 10 3 of the basin the spatial distribution of the land cover use types in the grb is shown in fig 2b there are a total of seven types 1 urban 2 croplands 3 forest 4 shrublands 5 wetland 6 barren rock and 7 water forest is the dominant land cover type in the simulation domain and both forest and croplands cover approximately 90 of the grb table 1 table 1 lists the initial parameters describing the land cover use types ascribed to the grb surface flow model the parameter values for urban croplands and forest zones were initially assigned based on the study of hwang et al 2020 who investigated surface flow under similar land cover conditions other parameter values were initially assigned according to mccuen 1989 it is noted that in order to reduce the computational cost and complexity during model calibration only the most important sensitive parameters such as the roughness coefficients for the urban croplands and water zones were included in the calibration process to fit the observation data in hgs the actual evapotranspiration aet is computed using an evapotranspiration et model suggested by kristensen and jensen 1975 the details of the et process are presented in aquanty inc 2019 for the et calculations in the grb model the et zones were assigned based on land use cover types such that all et zones are identical to the surface flow zones of the grb model fig 2b table 2 summarizes et zone properties used for the grb simulations similar to the surface model there are a total of seven et zones among which the forest and crop areas are dominant in other words the et zones of the forest and crop areas are the main sinks affecting the water balance of the grb the et properties of these zones were obtained through the calibration process for the seasonality of the et parameterization the monthly normal or mean monthly leaf area index lai for each et zone was used based on the study conducted by park et al 2013 2 1 2 three dimensional subsurface model using geologic information from borehole logging a three dimensional 3d subsurface domain was constructed with four main material types competent bedrock weathered rock unconsolidated deposits and topsoil fig 3 the bottom elevation of the bedrock layer was assigned at 70 m a s l and the top surface elevation of the model was assigned using the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m digital elevation model farr et al 2007 the bedrock layer with a thickness ranging from 4 to 195 m was assigned as the bottom of the subsurface domain the weathered rock layer with an average thickness of 13 m was placed above the bedrock layer the unconsolidated layer lying on top of the weathered rock was assigned below the topsoil layer and its thickness ranges from 1 to 36 m calibrated subsurface zone properties used in the simulations are listed in table 3 anisotropic hydraulic conductivity values were assigned to the consolidated and unconsolidated rocks which are underlain by the topsoil layers the ratios of horizontal kx ky to vertical kz hydraulic conductivities for the rock types range from 4 to 13 isotropic conditions however were assigned to the topsoil layers lee et al 2020 except for the bedrock the hydraulic conductivities for all of the zones were adjusted in the model calibration process the porosity and specific storage parameters were assigned based on previous studies park et al 2013 moe 2019 2 2 model calibration the model calibration was focused using monthly normal or mean conditions for each month of the year i e average january conditions from 2013 to 2017 average february conditions from 2013 to 2017 etc these monthly normal conditions represent the average annual cycle of hydrologic hydrogeologic conditions within the basin as discussed in erler et al 2019a b because fully transient simulations are difficult to track and time consuming simulations with monthly normal forcing are a compromise between fully transient and steady state conditions by using a representative seasonal cycle based on mean monthly hydrologic conditions according to xu et al 2021 simulations with the monthly normal forcing can provide seasonal variability over an average annual cycle for these reasons the model calibration with the monthly normal forcing can be a cost effective approach the time period considered for model calibration in this study is from 2013 to 2017 as such it only reflects the period after the construction of the three weirs i e sejong gongju and baekje weirs in the downstream region of the grb the calibration targets consist of groundwater level measurements stream flow observations and surface water discharge rates and water depths measured at the dam and weir reservoirs details of the model calibration are provided in supporting information 2 3 monthly average transient simulation in order to evaluate calibrated model performance the grb model was further simulated using monthly average transient conditions the simulation period is five years from january 2013 to december 2017 during which the groundwater and surface water systems were affected by the operation of three weirs in the downstream areas the groundwater and surface water heads obtained from the model calibration were assigned as initial conditions for the monthly transient simulations the boundary conditions including assigned fluxes and critical depth outflow locations were the same as those applied to the monthly normal model calibration for the climate forcing data the monthly average total liquid precipitation was assigned to the surface flow domain additionally the potential evapotranspiration pet provided by the korea meteorological administration was also applied to the evapotranspiration domain 2 4 uncertainty analysis since the fully integrated grb model has many parameters that need to be estimated the uncertainty of the calibrated model needs to be investigated to assess the reliability of the predications for water management and decision making issues in this study we evaluated the uncertainty of the predictive simulations on weir operation scenarios based on a linearized uncertainty model based on a bayesian approach christensen and doherty 2008 doherty et al 2010 1 σ p 2 z t c p z z t c p j t j c p j t c ε 1 j c p z where σ p 2 represents the predictive uncertainty variance of parameter p z is the predictive sensitivity vector j is the jacobian matrix with respect to p c p is the precalibration covariance matrices and c ε is the observation errors with the estimated uncertainty of the model parameters we evaluated the predictive uncertainty of the river flow and reservoir depths under weir operation scenarios latin hypercube sampling lhs was used to generate uniformly distributed random samples from equally probable parameter combinations mckay et al 2000 the lhs method is implemented in the hydrogeosphere uncertainty quantification tool hgsuq aquanty inc 2017 miller et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance the model calibration was performed based on the monthly normal surface water and groundwater conditions the performance of the calibrated model was further evaluated under the monthly transient conditions the results of the calibrated model performance are detailed in supporting information briefly the calibrated model can reproduce the spatiotemporal behavior of the integrated flow system with an acceptable range of simulation error but groundwater table near the tributaries and surface flow during the high flow seasons were consistently underestimated due to the relatively low mesh resolution of the model 3 2 characteristics of integrated flow system 3 2 1 subsurface flow system the spatial distribution of the annual average depth to the water table is shown in fig 4 a the sub basins upstream of the daecheong dam shown in fig 4a are mostly mountainous and are characterized by a relatively deep groundwater system of which groundwater depths to the water table range from 10 to 50 m in fig 4b the standard deviations of the depth to the water table in the upstream region are greater than 0 5 m while those in the downstream area below the daecheong dam are less than 0 1 m in agricultural fields located in the relatively low relief areas of the downstream region the mean depth to the water table is typically less than 1 0 m σ 0 05 due mainly to groundwater inflow from surrounding regions at higher elevations the simulated groundwater table is slightly lowered by the pumping wells in highland areas the overall pumping effects on the groundwater system appear to be less important because the total pumping rate estimated during the simulation period is approximately 1 84 109 m3 which is about 17 of the total precipitation however because the groundwater pumping in this area occurs year round the amount of the groundwater extraction is about 52 of the average net precipitation it may be more significant during the dry periods when the net precipitation is negative the spatial changes in the water table depths are relatively large due to the topographic relief additionally the standard deviation of the water table depths at the pumping wells ranges from 0 01 near the surface m to 0 5 m in the deep aquifer indicating that the groundwater table of the deep aquifer is more affected by the groundwater pumping 3 2 2 evapotranspiration the simulated annual mean aet during the five year period ranges from approximately 400 to 1 100 mm y fig 5 a for the annual changes in aet the standard deviation σ of the simulated aet ranges from 60 to 200 mm y fig 5b the mean aet over the basin is 750 mm y σ 98 the annual variations of aet tend to be proportional to the aet magnitudes specifically because aet is dependent on the water table depth or soil saturations the minimum aet occurs mainly in areas where the water table is relatively deep which can be affected by natural and anthropogenic factors the natural factors include topographic relief and underlying subsurface material properties in this case minimum aet occurs mainly in the highlands where the depth to the water table is deeper than 3 m for the anthropogenic factors they occur mainly in the groundwater pumping areas where many wells are highly clustered however it is worth noting that the pumped water is being used for irrigation purpose and thus the simulated aet in these areas can be closer to pet in reality indicating possible limitations in this model on the other hand the maximum aet occurs mainly where there is high evaporation from the dam reservoirs and evapotranspiration from the groundwater discharge areas where the topsoil layer is close to saturation spatially there are slight changes in the areal mean aet between the upstream and downstream portions of the basin the mean aet is 763 mm y in the upstream area of the yongdam dam which is slightly great than the mid 751 mm y and downstream 747 mm y areas the minor changes in the areal mean aet are mainly derived from the characteristics of the land cover types the forest and croplands cover approximately 90 of the basin and the croplands 30 are primarily located in the downstream area regarding the land cover types the mean aet in the forest areas ranges from 700 to 760 mm y which is similar to the areal average in the crop areas located in upstream of the sejong weir and downstream of the baekje weir the simulated mean aet ranges from 800 to 850 mm y which is higher than the overall mean aet because of the relatively shallow groundwater table compared to upstream areas 3 2 3 surface water groundwater interactions the annual mean and standard deviation of the simulated exchange flux are plotted in fig 6 a and b respectively for the annual mean exchange flux there are two components infiltration shown in blue and represented by negative values and exfiltration shown in red and represented by positive values fig 6a dark colors represent greater magnitudes based on the characteristics of the spatial distribution of the exchange flux exfiltration fluxes or groundwater seepage ranging from 100 to 2000 mm y tend to be slightly dominant along the streams while groundwater infiltration fluxes ranging from 100 to 2000 mm y are strongly dominant in the mountainous and highland areas where the groundwater table is relatively deep the overall basin averaged infiltration and exfiltration rates are 1280 mm y and 1050 mm y respectively note that the infiltration flux used in this analysis is not necessarily groundwater recharge because infiltrated water can be taken up by subsurface evaporation and transpiration the magnitude of the mean infiltration rate is about 22 greater than that of the exfiltration rate the standard deviation of the exchange flux over the basin is approximately 70 mm y fig 6b in the upstream area the mean infiltration and exfiltration rates in the yongdam dam area are 1120 mm y and 610 mm y respectively the standard deviations of both infiltration and exfiltration are less than 100 mm y fig 6b the mean infiltration is about two times greater than the mean exfiltration because of the relatively high mountainous terrains in the midstream area the mean exfiltration increases to 2020 mm y while the mean infiltration in this subbasin is 1460 mm y which is about 30 greater than that in the upstream region the standard deviation of the exchange flux in this area is 74 mm y fig 6b the mean infiltration in the downstream area is about 13 less than the basin averaged infiltration which is also lower than those in the upstream and midstream areas additionally the mean exfiltration in this area is about 42 less than the basin averaged exfiltration the relatively large decrease in the mean infiltration and exfiltration is due to the presence of the large crop fields where the groundwater depths are shallow and thus the exchange fluxes are almost balanced or less than 150 mm y 3 3 water balance analysis 3 3 1 net precipitation the temporal changes in total precipitation positive values blue and aet negative values red over the basin from 2013 to 2017 are shown in fig 7 net precipitation green was also estimated by calculating the difference between the total precipitation and aet rates the overall average rates of total precipitation and aet are 347 and 236 m3 s respectively the average net precipitation is 111 m3 s with a net precipitation ratio of 0 32 which is similar to 0 29 estimated by hwang et al 2020 for a watershed in wonju located less than 100 km from the grb the temporal variation of the net precipitation is significant from year to year ranging from 30 m3 s 97 mm y in 2015 to 269 m3 s 857 mm y in 2017 it is noted that each year has water deficit conditions in which the net precipitation is below zero because aet exceeds precipitation water deficit conditions occur during the april june and september october periods on the other hand maximum water surplus conditions occur mainly during the july august period the annual net precipitation in 2013 2014 and 2016 fall within a similar range with a difference of less than 40 of the average net precipitation while those in 2015 and 2017 are about 73 lower and 150 greater than the average net precipitation respectively based on the water balance results a relatively strong dry condition occurred in 2015 with a net precipitation ratio of 0 12 the annual net precipitation ratio in 2017 is 0 35 which is similar to the average over the simulation period both strong dry and wet conditions however occur in 2017 due mainly to relatively high precipitation and aet 3 3 2 groundwater seepage contributions groundwater seepage and surface flow rates along the geum river were estimated using the simulated groundwater exfiltration seepage fluxes fig 8 shows the comparison of groundwater seepage red and surface flow rates blue along the geum river the dark shaded areas represent the standard deviation of the flow rates overall both flow rates gradually increase from the headwater 0 km to the outlet 334 km of the river it is noted that the stream flows in the dam and weir reservoirs are not included in the stream flow plots in fig 8 for better visualization of the stream flow trends additionally the step changes in the stream flow and groundwater seepage rates along the geum river corresponds to the contributions of the inflows from its tributaries fig 8a shows the comparison between river blue and groundwater seepage flow rates red during the dry seasons over the simulation period the river flow at the outlet ranges from 52 3 166 7 mm y to 172 8 m3 s 550 8 mm y with a mean of 111 7 m3 s 356 0 mm y σ 28 2 the mean groundwater seepage rate upstream of the outlet is 32 5 m3 s 103 6 mm y σ 2 8 which is 29 1 of the mean river flow the stream flow drastically increases at about 229 km where the miho river one of the main tributaries joins to the geum river the mean groundwater contribution to the geum river during the wet season decreases to 17 7 because the mean stream flow increases by a factor of 1 5 but the mean groundwater seepage is more or less similar to that of the dry season fig 8b in addition the standard deviation and minimum and maximum seepage rates at the outlet also fall in similar ranges which indicates that the groundwater seepage rates are not sensitive to seasonal hydrologic conditions fig 8c shows the annual mean flow conditions over the simulation period the annual mean river flow and groundwater seepage at the outlet are 131 3 m3 s 418 5 mm y σ 66 7 and 31 7 m3 s 101 0 mm y σ 3 1 m3 s respectively of which the mean groundwater contribution is 24 2 the groundwater seepage contribution to the river flow varies from 10 in upstream of the yongdam dam to 34 in midstream near the daecheong dam with an overall standard deviation of 10 3 4 decision support model with parametric uncertainty for a reliable decision support model it is important to consider model uncertainty due to various limitations inherent in a calibrated model such as non uniqueness issues lack of observation dataset and assumptions about model structure schoups et al 2006 delottier et al 2017 in this study because the grb is highly affected by anthropogenic activities and water management policies a reliable assessment of the water management impact in the grb is essential therefore an ensemble of 15 uncertainty runs obtained from lhs was performed for assessing the impact of current and future water management activities in the grb specifically the effect of groundwater pumping and weir operations on surface water and groundwater conditions were evaluated using the monthly transient model base case first groundwater pumping effects on the groundwater system of the grb were estimated by comparing the base case simulation results with a simulation case where there is no groundwater pumping occurred in the basin second a simulation with a weir removal scenario was performed to evaluate the effect of weir dismantling on surface flow conditions by comparing the results to the base case simulation 3 4 1 parameter uncertainty to reduce the computing effort only parameters with relatively high sensitivities were selected and their corresponding σ p 2 values were applied to generate simulation parameter sets using lhs as listed in table 4 the parameters used for the uncertainty analysis are the main parameters in the subsurface surface and evapotranspiration domains the subsurface parameters correspond to the hydraulic conductivities of the topsoil and unconsolidated rock layers which affect shallow groundwater levels and exchange fluxes the surface model parameters used in the uncertainty analysis are the manning s coefficients for water forest and cropland which are dominant in the grb surface model similarly the field capacity and oxic limits of the forest and cropland zones in the evapotranspiration domain were included for the uncertainty analysis the 95 confidence interval of each parameter was computed from its mean or calibrated value and predictive uncertainty standard deviation σ p the 95 confidence intervals for the parameters are mostly within one order of magnitude range the maximum difference between the calibrated parameter value and the 95 confidence interval is 5 5 which indicates that the uncertainty of the calibrated model is small and thus the simulation results are acceptable based on the number of parameter sets obtained from lhs a total of 15 runs were performed to evaluate the predictive uncertainty of the grb model on water management or decisions 3 4 2 groundwater pumping effect to evaluate the groundwater pumping impact on the groundwater system within the basin we performed a simulation case with no groundwater pumping in the grb the effect of groundwater pumping was evaluated by subtracting the results of the groundwater pumping case base case from the results of a simulation without pumping the groundwater pumping rates applied to the monthly average transient simulation are based on the calibration results the calibrated annual average pumping rate over the basin is approximately 3 68 108 m3 y which is about 24 less than that reported during the simulation period see section s1 1 3 in the supporting information however it is noted that there may be a large difference between the reported and actual groundwater pumping rates because the reported annual average pumping rate was calculated based on the maximum pumping rate of each well that was reported for obtaining permission from the government kim et al 2013 in the calculation the changes in the annual mean depth to the water table was used as the measure all other conditions such as initial and boundary conditions are the same as those assigned for the base case fig 9 shows the impact of the groundwater pumping in the basin on the depth to the water table and the groundwater seepage rates the spatial distribution of the watertable decline caused by the agricultural pumping shows that the drawdown area is mainly concentrated in the mid and downstream regions of the grb fig 9a overall the annual average watertable decline due to pumping is less than 20 m and there is almost no decline in the upstream areas such as near wg01 wg02 and wg03 where the average water level decline is less than 0 01 m in the midstream areas such as near wg05 wg06 wg07 and wg08 the average watertable decline ranges from 0 3 wg05 to 1 5 m wg06 but the groundwater pumping effects are relatively minor because the groundwater decline area covers less than 10 of each total wg area in the downstream areas from wg10 to wg14 the average decrease in the depth to the water table ranges from 0 36 to 0 74 m the area of watertable decline covers between 21 and 51 of each total area specifically the wg13 and wg14 areas are significantly affected by the groundwater pumping with a watertable decline area of 45 for wg13 and 51 for wg14 fig 9a groundwater seepage along the geum river for the no pumping case was calculated to quantify the impact of pumping on the groundwater contribution to the streams as shown in fig 9b from the upstream to the downstream portion near the sejong weir 240 km from origin there is almost no difference between two cases in the downstream of the sejong weir the average seepage rate for the base case is slightly lower than the no pumping case all the seepage rates including average minimum and maximum are linearly decreased by the groundwater pumping at the outlet of the river the difference in the average seepage rate between two cases is about 0 8 m3 s which is 2 4 of the total seepage rate for the no pumping case additionally the groundwater seepage is reduced by 3 0 by the groundwater pumping during the low flow seasons although the effect of the groundwater pumping is relatively minor excessive pumping activities in the downstream areas may cause significant drawdown and reduced groundwater seepage in the rivers during extreme water deficit conditions 3 4 3 weir removal scenario in order to assess the impact of removing weirs in the grb a weir removal scenario was performed while accounting for model uncertainty in this case three weirs the sejong gongju and baekje weirs were excluded from the base case monthly transient model all other numerical inputs including the initial and boundary conditions are the same as those of the base case using the simulated surface flow rates and reservoir depths at the weirs we analyzed the impact of removing the control structures on the surface flow system in the downstream area fig 10 shows the comparison of the surface flow rates and water depths in the weir reservoirs between the weir removal scenario lines with symbols and the base case lines without symbols the solid lines represent average surface flows and water depths over all simulations performed for the uncertainty analysis and the dotted lines correspond to their minimum and maximum values the average stream flow rates computed at the weir reservoirs show a significant increase for the weir removal scenario fig 10a specifically the flow rates at the weir reservoirs are less than 0 5 m3 s during the weir operations because of the bottleneck effect in the reservoirs but all the stream flows for the weir removal scenario increase to approximately 100 m3 s which is more than three orders of magnitude higher than the base case results for the model uncertainty there are minor differences in the stream flow rates such that the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum stream flows is less than 0 1 m3 s for the base case and 10 m3 s for the weir removal case similar to the changes in the stream flow there are also significant changes in the reservoir water depth for the weir removal scenario fig 10b for the base case the average water depth at the weir reservoirs ranges from 2 3 m at the sejong weir to 4 2 m at the gongju weir for the weir removal scenario however the average reservoir water depth reduces to 0 7 m at the sejong weir and 1 3 m at the baekje weir which are about 2 to 4 times shallower than the base case results the model uncertainty associated with the surface water depths is also in an acceptable range with the maximum difference being less than 0 1 m for both cases overall the results suggest that there are significant changes in the downstream areas of the grb when the weirs are removed the changes in the stream flow rates and surface water depths may cause a chain of changes in riverine ecosystems surface water quality and surface water and groundwater interactions therefore it is necessary to consider appropriate weir removal plans that can mitigate the effect of the drastic changes in the surface flow regime 4 summary and conclusion sustainable water resources management requires a comprehensive understanding of an integrated hydrosystem consisting of multi physical components this study presents an integrated surface subsurface model of the geum river basin in south korea as a decision supporting method for surface water and groundwater management such as engineered hydrologic control structure operations and agricultural groundwater extractions the basin scale model was calibrated with various calibration targets such as monthly normal stream flow depth to the water table dam weir discharge rate and surface water depth at each reservoir because many parameters to be estimed and observations were included in the calibration process we used a stepwise calibration approach based on the model calibration results the spatiotemporal behavior of the surface flow and groundwater system was reproduced with an acceptable degree of accuracy however regarding the model limitations the subsurface model tended to underestimate water table close to the streams due to relatively low mesh resolutions near the branches of the geum river the calibrated integrated model was further simulated by driving it with the monthly transient atmospheric forcing and anthropogenic conditions over a five year period for which the observed data were not used for calibration the monthly transient simulation results demonstrated that the seasonal changes in groundwater levels and surface flow rates were reproduced well under complex groundwater pumping and dam weir operation conditions the analysis of the transient simulation results revealed that the water budget of the basin was balanced or slightly subject to water surplus conditions but water deficit conditions occurred consistently during the dry seasons over the simulation period additionally the groundwater seepage along the rivers within the basin was an important water source component that can sustain environmental flow under severe water deficit conditions for better support water management decision making we performed simulations with model uncertainty and estimated the impact of groundwater pumping and weir operation scenarios on the surface water and groundwater system in the grb groundwater pumping over the basin showed a significant influence on the groundwater system in the downstream portion of the basin where the annual mean watertable elevation decreased by up to 0 4 m with a standard deviation of 0 06 m consequently the groundwater discharge fluxes along the geum river were also reduced by the groundwater pumping in the downstream part of the basin although the amount of the reduction in the annual mean groundwater seepage was about 2 4 with a standard deviation of 0 05 the effect of the reduction was expected to be more significant during dry seasons due to the negative net precipitation causing water deficit conditions the weir removal scenario assuming that three weirs in the downstream area were dismantled was simulated to analyze its impact on the surface water system simulation results showed that the surface flow rates at the weir reservoirs increased by more than three orders of magnitudes and the reservoir water depths decreased by two to four times compared to those for the case with weir operation the model uncertainty associated with both the base and weir removal cases was less than 10 of the mean values and thus was in an acceptable range this indicates that the weir operations significantly impact the surface flow conditions and they also increase water residence times in the reservoirs therefore effective and comprehensive weir removal plans are necessary to avoid or minimize the impact of the drastic surface water changes on the ecosystem in the downstream areas of the grb with the numerical schemes used for assessing the anthropogenic effects the simulation results demonstrated that the integrated basin scale model can provide many useful insights on the factors affecting hydrologic processes within the basin from a gross water balance for the entire hydrologic system to detailed surface water and groundwater interactions affected by the anthropogenic activities the integrated modelling approach used in this study is applicable to other areas where decision support for water management plans are needed credit authorship contribution statement hyoun tae hwang conceptualization software formal

3933,the multi model combination is a technique to improve the performances of hydrological streamflow simulations an area that has not been investigated much is the performance dependence of combination techniques on the hydrological model calibration strategy and ensemble size this study aims at investigating the joint effect of the hydrological models calibration strategies and ensemble sizes on combination abilities for selecting the most appropriate multi model combination method the ensemble members were constructed by applying four hydrological models and four objective functions over 383 catchments in china the ensemble members were combined by using nine commonly used methods which are equal weights ewa akaike information criterion aica bayes information criterion bica bates and granger bga granger ramanathan a b and c gra grb and grc bayesian model averaging bma and multi model super ensemble mmse the grc is found as the best multi model combination method for hydrological simulations adding ensemble members by either multiple hydrological models or calibration strategies could help to improve the simulation abilities specifically the increase of ensemble members can obviously enhance the performance of multi model combinations when the ensemble size is less than six while only limited improvement is achieved when the ensemble size is more than nine the combination of ensemble members with various calibration strategies is hard to compensate for the weakness of hydrological model structures as well the application of a single calibration strategy in ensemble members only emphasizes single discharge periods and neglects other important discharge periods this study found that various models with different objective functions are more robust and efficient the combination performs better than any individual model in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for approximately 70 catchments but the multi model combination is less efficient in terms of low flow simulations keywords multi model combination method ensemble modeling calibration strategy ensemble size joint effect 1 introduction hydrological models are essential tools for addressing a wide spectrum of hydrological and water resources problems including water resources planning drought and flood control simulation at ungauged locations and impact studies for climate or land use changes kotsuki et al 2014 kudo et al 2017 lane et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 over the last decades a large number of hydrological models have been developed ranging from lumped conceptual models to physically based distributed models arnold et al 1998 chiew et al 2002 edijatno et al 1999 liang et al 1994 xu 2021 zhao et al 1980 the performance of those models varies for diverse catchments characterized by different climate land use and topography according to the strengths and weaknesses of the modeling mendoza et al 2016 pechlivanidis et al 2011 vansteenkiste et al 2014a zhang et al 2020 it is hard to determine a priori which model is most appropriate for a given application over widely differing characteristics of catchments a single model is not able to consistently outperform the others for all catchment characteristics and heterogeneous climatology arsenault et al 2015 kumar et al 2015 velazquez et al 2010 several studies arsenault et al 2015 velázquez et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 found that multi model combinations are more robust and efficient than their individual members with the concept of using ensemble to reducing errors with an optimal bias and variance trade off a wide range of methods can be used to generate a multi model combination solution the simplest example is the calculation of the arithmetic mean of the input models commonly referred to as the equal weights averaging ewa more sophisticated techniques employ weighted schemes with differential weightings applied to each input model reflecting their relative advantages or limitations there are some popular techniques used to obtain the optimal set weights for multi model combinations like multiple linear regression arsenault et al 2015 granger and ramanathan 1984 kumar et al 2015 machine learning algorithms jeong and kim 2009 shamseldin et al 1997 zaherpour et al 2019 bayesian model averaging neuman 2003 and information criterion averaging akaike 1974 schwarz 1978 the challenge in ensemble modeling is to determine the ensemble size and to identify the best averaging method arsenault et al 2015 buizza and palmer 1998 kumar et al 2015 many studies jeong and kim 2009 shamseldin et al 1997 sun and trevor 2018 zaherpour et al 2019 have attempted to identify the best multi model combination method for hydrological simulations shamseldin et al 1997 applied three methods simple arithmetic mean constrained ordinary least squares weighting and neural network to combine four hydrological models for 11 catchments and found the constrained ordinary least squares weighting and neural network are more robust and efficient than the simple arithmetic mean in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse broderick et al 2016 analyzed the performance of four ensemble averaging techniques using four hydrological models for 37 irish catchments they concluded that gra is the best ensemble averaging technique and the averaging methods performed better for the nse as opposed to bias metrics in addition some studies investigated the effect of ensemble size on the performance of multi model ensemble simulations for example arsenault et al 2015 compared nine multi model averaging approaches using 12 hydrographs 4 models 3 metrics over 429 catchments they found that grc performs better than other averaging methods and no catchment requiring more than seven ensemble members to maximize the nse with this method kumar et al 2015 compared ten different multi model ensemble methods using eight hydrological models to select the best multi model ensemble method for the discharge estimation over a catchment of the mahanadi river basin in india they showed that the constrained multiple linear regression is the most suitable multi model ensemble method in terms of nse root mean square error rmse and pearson s correlation coefficient r and five ensembles show the best performance for the study area the method of multi model combination is usually used to extract as much information as possible from a group of existing models which may produce a better overall simulation as each simulation of the group provides specific information in addition to the selection of the hydrological models the process of parameter identification is also a crucial step in streamflow modeling the calibration strategies which here mean choice of objective functions reflect the goodness of fitting between hydrological model simulations and observations which can substantially influence the model parameters and the streamflow projections krysanova et al 2018 lane et al 2019 mizukami et al 2019 seiller et al 2017 the hydrological models with various structures and calibration strategies have certain capacities to predict the streamflow in general the hydrological simulations achieve maximum accuracy in terms of specific hydrological properties using a particular metric but that might limit the modeling skill in other aspects arsenault et al 2015 mizukami et al 2019 seiller et al 2017 for example the most widely used calibration strategies such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge emphasize high flow events and their timing gupta et al 2009 mizukami et al 2019 nash and sutcliffe 1970 those metrics calculated on the natural logarithm of the flow values put more weight on low flows pushpalatha et al 2012 seiller et al 2017 the use of multi model combination scheme is expected to benefit from the variation of the parameter sets derived from objective functions targeted at different hydrological processes to produce a better overall simulation although the influence of calibration strategies exists in hydrological modeling the impacts of hydrological model calibration strategies on the performance of multi model combinations and their joint effects with ensemble sizes are not clear moreover there is no consensus in the hydrological community in terms of the selection of particular multi model ensemble sizes to ensure good model performances this study aims to investigate the joint effect of ensemble sizes and hydrological model calibration strategies on combination abilities for selecting the most appropriate multi model combination method specifically nine commonly used multi model combination techniques are compared over 383 catchments in china using ensemble members derived from 4 hydrological models calibrated with 4 objective functions the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a brief introduction of the study data and the methodology including the hydrological models the calibration strategies the multi model combination techniques and the details of the evaluation technique used in this study the results are presented in section 3 followed by the discussion and conclusion in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 study region and data this study used a gridded meteorological dataset 0 5 0 5 over china for the period of 1961 2016 which contains four climate variables including daily precipitation daily maximum minimum and mean air temperatures to represent observed data this dataset was generated from 2 472 in situ gauge stations across china by thin plate spline interpolation method and gtopo30 global 30 arc second elevation data sampling and is considered as the latest gridded meteorological data with the highest spatial resolution in china this dataset has been commonly used in many hydro climatological studies in china gu et al 2021 li et al 2019 yin et al 2020 and downloaded from the china meteorological data sharing service system http www cma gov cn the daily streamflow series over 383 catchments in china were used fig 1 these catchments with a wide range of climatic conditions and hydrological regimes span over all the nine major river basins in china based on climate type and physical geography this study region was divided into four major climate regions continental climate zone of northwest nw the highland climate zone of southwest tibetan plateau sw the temperate monsoon region of northeast ne and the tropical and subtropical monsoon region of southeast se ding 2013 wu et al 2016 ne is the driest region according to the average aridity index value fig 2 the size of the catchments ranges from 612 km2 to 995 343 km2 the streamflow dataset covers the 1961 2016 period with a maximum length of 52 years and a minimum length of 22 years the average annual precipitation of the catchment varies greatly with clear gradients depending on the region the mean annual precipitation is more than 1400 mm in the southern region while it is less than 600 mm in the northern region 2 2 hydrological models a wide range of hydrological models is used for different application purposes some studies compared the performance of lumped and distributed models for outlet streamflow simulation and found that two types of models may lead to similar accuracy kumar et al 2015 lobligeois et al 2014 vansteenkiste et al 2014b even for quite large catchments merz et al 2009 considering the scope of this study the lumped model the most common model type used by hydrologists for water resources assessment flood forecasting and impact of climate change studies was chosen and the distributed model with expensive computations was excluded four lumped models with different complexity were used i e modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j edijatno et al 1999 perrin et al 2003 hydrological model of école de technologie supérieure hmets martel et al 2017 simple hydrolog simhyd chiew et al 2002 and xinanjiang xaj zhao 1992 zhao et al 1980 those models have been widely used in streamflow simulation and have been shown to be relatively efficient arsenault et al 2015 broderick et al 2016 jones et al 2006 liang et al 2013 mathevet et al 2020 table 1 briefly summarized the basic information for these hydrological models the four models have different numbers of parameters and are different in model structures and underlying mechanisms for example the physical process is described in more detailed and complex mechanisms in hmets simhyd and xaj than in the most parsimonious structure gr4j with only four free parameters the main feature of the runoff generation of hmets and xaj is using the saturation excess flow mechanism based on the soil moisture content of the aeration zone reaching its field capacity while simhyd considers both infiltration excess runoff and saturation excess runoff in streamflow production calculated by an interception store a nonlinear soil moisture store for the simulation of evaporation xaj uses a three layer evaporation model while hmets and simhyd use a one layer model additionally gr4j and hmets consider the incorporation of groundwater exchange by surface water groundwater interaction functions but xaj and simhyd do not have this consideration since gr4j xaj and simhyd do not simulate snow accumulation or melt processes a snow module cemaneige with 2 free parameters valéry et al 2014 was combined with the original model to make it applicable in seasonally snow covered catchments in northern china the basic inputs of these four models are catchment averaged precipitation and temperature potential evapotranspiration over the entire basin for the computation of discharge the potential evapotranspiration was estimated using a temperature based method proposed by oudin et al 2006a 2 3 calibration and evaluation metrics this study used four objective functions to calibrate the four hydrological models over 383 catchments the four calibration strategies are the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nse computed on natural logarithm and square root of the flow values nse ln and nse sqrt and percent bias pbias nse nse ln and nse sqrt all range from negative infinity to 1 with a value of 1 indicating perfect fitting the pbias value being closer to zero indicates the better simulating performances different calibration strategies were included in the combination since they emphasize different aspects of hydrological streamflow properties the original nse without discharge transformation puts great emphasis on high flows li et al 2019 mizukami et al 2019 the natural logarithm of discharge transformation nse ln is to optimize the performance for low flow segments seiller et al 2017 the analysis of nse sqrt well balances simulated streamflow without too much emphasis on low or high flow oudin et al 2006b and the pbias emphasizes the total water balance regardless of the objective function the hydrological models optimized the parameter using the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 a cross validation method that divided the complete record of each catchment arsenault et al 2015 yang et al 2020 into odd and even years for model calibration and validation was used to reduce the influence from the non stationarity of hydro climatological conditions in this process the first year in the calibration period was used for model warm up in addition to using nse nse ln nse sqrt and pbias as evaluation metrics to represent the overall performance of simulations the high and low flows were also analyzed based on the discharge segments of flow duration curves fdc to identify the influence of ensemble method on the performance of various flow components following previous studies laaha and blöschl 2006 pfannerstill et al 2014 yilmaz et al 2008 the flow exceedance probability of 70 was used to represent the low flow and the mid flow segment was shifted from 20 to 70 the very high flow range was defined between 0 and 5 and the high flow range between 5 and 20 the performance of the model simulations within these fdc segments was analyzed using pbias pbiasfsv noted by pbiasfsv 5 pbiasfsv 20 pbiasfsv mid and pbiasfsv low the basic information of those metrics which were used for evaluating the performance of the different hydrograph phases was shown in table 2 2 4 multi model averaging methods there are several methods available in the literature for developing the multi model combination here we compared the performance of nine commonly used deterministic ensemble techniques for creating multi model ensembles the selected methods include equal weights averaging ewa akaike information criterion averaging aica bayes information criterion averaging bica bates and granger averaging bga granger ramanathan a averaging gra granger ramanathan b averaging grb granger ramanathan c averaging grc bayesian model averaging bma and multi model super ensemble mmse the general model for averaging methods can be expressed as q ens i 1 n w i q simi where q ens is the ensemble simulation q simi is the individual simulation and wi is the weight of the ensemble member a description of the selected averaging methods was given in the appendix the basic characteristics of the nine multi model averaging techniques were summarized in table 3 3 results 3 1 performance of the individual members the performances of the 16 ensemble members over 383 catchments in the calibration and validation were analyzed using the evaluation of nse nse ln nse sqrt and pbias representing the average simulated abilities and using the pbias of four different fdc segments pbiasfsv 5 pbiasfsv 20 pbiasfsv mid and pbiasfsv low representing the high and low flows as presented in fig 3 the result shows that the evaluation metrics in the validation period are consistent with those in the calibration period which indicates the hydrological simulations are robust and transferable the ensemble members with calibration strategies closely related to the evaluation metrics work best as expected models calibrated with nse sqrt maintain good performances in terms of nse and nse ln evaluation with median values around 0 7 and 0 8 all ensemble members show the absolute value of pbias being less than 10 but the models calibrated with pbias yield inferior performance in terms of nse based evaluation metrics according to the fdc segment evaluation values fig 3e 3 h the models calibrated with nse show good performance for high flow segments that obtain the best score for 38 and 42 of catchments in terms of the pbiasfsv 5 and pbiasfsv 20 respectively table 4 the models calibrated with nse ln put high weight on low flows and obtain the best score at a frequency of 42 catchments models calibrated with nse sqrt emphasize middle flows which obtain the best score at a frequency of 38 catchments those results confirmed the specialization of the objective functions for specific parts of the hydrographs this figure also demonstrates that hydrologic models perform differently with respect to different calibration strategies and evaluation metrics for example calibrated with nse both hmets and gr4j with median nse ln value of 0 6 perform better than simhyd and xaj with median nse ln value of 0 3 and 0 5 in addition hmets and gr4j tend to overestimate the midle and low flow segments while the other two models i e simhyd and xaj tend to underestimate those flows comparing the hydrological models xaj generally performs best for the evaluation metrics followed by hmets gr4j and simhyd when looking at four sub regions based on the median value of evaluation metrics fig 4 different models show similar spatial patterns in terms of nse based metrics with better performances in the wetter southern catchments sw and se than in drier northern catchments nw and ne however the performance of the four hydrological models is not the same gr4j and simhyd perform better than xaj and hmets in terms of nse based metrics over sw when using nse ln as the objective function 3 2 performance of the multi model averaging methods the nine multi model combination methods were applied to calculate the optimal weights based on the observed and the 16 simulated streamflow series the performance of those methods over 383 catchments in the validation period is presented in fig 5 the result shows that the differences of the ensemble simulations are evident not just in how well the averaging methods but also in the evaluation metrics used for nse metric almost all multi model combination methods show similar performances with median values around 0 8 except for ewa bga and bma with median values less than 0 75 for nse ln metric ewa bga and bma perform better than others with median values around 0 8 followed by gra grb and grc with median values around 0 75 almost all averaging methods show similar performances in terms of nse sqrt metric with median values exceeding 0 81 for pbias and pbiasfsv 5 gra grb grc and mmse show similar performances and outperform others followed by aica and bica for pbiasfsv 20 pbiasfsv mid and pbiasfsv low grc performs the best followed by gra grb and mmse in general all simulations tend to underestimate the high flow but overestimating the mid and low flows among various averaging methods gra grb grc and mmse show similar performance since they derived from the same optimal weighting group the aica and bica perform poorly in terms of nse ln and pbiasfsv low metrics compared with other averaging methods as they put almost all weights on the individual member with minimum rmse it can also be seen that the bma ewa and bga without bias correction show worse performances in terms of pbias based measures especially for pbias pbiasfsv 5 and pbiasfsv low overall the gra grb grc and mmse consistently outperformed other combination methods in terms of the eight evaluation metrics and grc provided the best performances especially in terms of pbias and pbiasfsv therefore grc is considered as the best multi model averaging method for hydrological simulations in this study 3 3 impact of the hydrological model calibration strategy and ensemble size on multi model combinations this section investigated the joint influence of the hydrological models calibration strategies and ensemble size on the performance of grc the selection of ensemble members is based on multiple hydrological models calibrated with a single objective function a single hydrological model calibrated with multiple objective functions and multiple hydrological models calibrated with multiple objective functions fig 6 shows the median performance value over 383 catchments in the validation period to represent the overall ability of those combinations the performance of multiple hydrological models calibrated with a single objective function varies depending on the selection of objective function and is improved along with the increase of hydrological model numbers areas numbered 2 in fig 6 areas numbered 3 in fig 6 show the performances of a hydrological model with multiple objective functions though using multiple objective functions could improve the combination abilities the performances still depend on the selection of hydrological models as each hydrological model has its own advantages and limitations for example the combinations based on simhyd generally perform worse than others in terms of nse and nse sqrt but perform better in terms of nse ln pbias and pbiasfsv low in addition a single model is not able to consistently outperform others for all catchments with various hydro climatic regimes the combinations of multiple hydrological models calibrated with various objective functions taking advantage of all ensemble members generally perform more robust and efficient than combinations only using a single calibration or a single hydrological model in terms of all nse based metrics areas numbered 4 in fig 6 overall either using multiple hydrological models or multiple calibration strategies could improve the multi model combination performances in terms of nse based metrics but is less efficient in pbias based evaluation metrics the above results also indicate that the influence of increasing hydrological models on combination is larger than increasing model calibration strategies and the effect of the individual simulation is decreasing along with the increase of ensemble members the qualitative comparison of different combinations and individual simulations would be analyzed later section 3 4 the combinations with ensemble sizes ranging from 2 to 16 ensemble members are generated by re sampling the ensemble members 100 times from all combination members to investigate the effect of ensemble size on simulating abilities fig 7 shows the relationship between the ensemble size and the combination performances the 0 05 and 0 25 quantiles of nse nse ln and nse sqrt values correspond to the poor efficiency modeling while 0 75 and 0 95 quantiles correspond to simulations with good performance the median performance is represented by quantile 0 50 red lines the absolute values of pbias and four pbiasfsv being infinite to zero indicating better performances this result indicates that the performance is improved along with the increase in ensemble sizes and the effect of ensemble size on the low quantile values is larger than that on the high quantile in general the performance of the multi model combinations is sensitive to the ensemble size and the selection of ensemble members when the member is less than six the influence of enlarging ensemble numbers on simulation performances could be ignored when the ensemble member is more than nine in other words when the ensemble member is more than nine neither enriching the hydrological model nor increasing calibration strategies show limited improvement in simulating abilities as larger ensemble sizes mean each individual member with smaller weights and limited influence on the combination in order to investigate whether all ensemble members contribute to the performance of the combination the frequency of the individual member being selected in the best performed combinations of all catchments is calculated and plotted in fig 8 here the ensemble sizes of the combinations are nine since the results from fig 7 concluded that the effect of increasing ensemble numbers more than nine could be ignored fig 8 shows that all individual members have similar chancies of being selected in the best performed combinations in terms of different evaluation metrics indicating all ensemble members contribute to enhancing the combination simulation 3 4 comparison of the multi model combination and ensemble members the performances of grc and the ensemble members were compared using the cumulative distributions of nse nse ln nse sqrt absolute values of pbias and pbiasfsv over the 383 catchments in the validation period fig 9 here five combinations are represented including four hydrological models calibrated with a specified objective function i e h4 nse h4 nse ln h4 nse sqrt and h4 pbias and four hydrological models calibrated with four calibration strategies i e h4c4 it is apparent that the multi model combinations either using multiple hydrological models or using multiple calibration strategies outperform the individual member in terms of those performance metrics except for nse ln and pbiasfsv low the combinations of four hydrological models calibrated with four calibration strategies perform the best and show 85 catchments have nse values exceeding 0 6 and 75 catchments have nse values exceeding 0 7 fig 9a in addition 91 catchments have nse sqrt values exceeding 0 6 and 73 catchments have nse sqrt values exceeding 0 7 fig 9b the absolute value of pbias is less than 10 for more than 95 catchments and that is less than 5 for 78 catchments in addition the absolute values of pbiasfsv 5 pbiasfsv 20 and pbiasfsv mid are less than 10 for 55 80 and 80 of catchments respectively however the combinations are less efficient in terms of nse ln and pbiasfsv low evaluation than the individual members using nse ln calibration since the averaging methods based on minimum rmse are more sensitive to flood peaks than low flow period table 5 shows the rate at which the averaging simulation surpasses the best individual member in terms of four average performance metrics and four fdc segment metrics over the 383 catchments in the validation period here the best individual member value is selected from the 16 members independently for each catchment the results show that four hydrological models calibrated with four calibrations h4c4 perform more robustly than other combinations in terms of various performance metrics the combination of four hydrological models calibrated with a specified objective only performs efficiently for the specific parts of the hydrographs the combinations perform better than the best individual member for about 70 catchments in terms of nse and for about 55 catchments in terms of nse sqrt on the contrary combinations show less efficiency for performance values in terms of nse ln and pbias fig 10 a and b show the geographic distribution of the nse value in the validation period from the best individual member and combinations the spatial patterns are consistent with better performances in the wetter southern catchments than in the drier northern catchments for catchments with annual precipitation larger than 600 mm 82 catchments obtain nse value exceeding 0 7 and the combination outperforms the best individual in 82 cases however for catchments with annual precipitation less than 600 mm only 51 catchments obtain nse value exceeding 0 7 and the combinations outperform the best individual only in 45 cases fig 10c and d since hydrological simulations are big challenges for the arid catchments especially when using lumped models which cannot represent the rainfall and loss variability that tends to be higher the multi model combinations have less benefit when the ensemble members cannot accurately simulate the streamflow 4 discussion and conclusion the multi model combination is a technique widely used to improve the performance of hydrological streamflow simulations as it extracts potentially useful information from a group of existing models the commonly used multi model combination usually takes information from different hydrological models while neglects the additional information from calibration strategies this study investigated the joint effect of hydrological models calibration strategies and ensemble sizes on combination abilities for selecting the appropriate multi model combination method this study compared different multi model ensemble methods by combining the simulated discharge with four hydrological models and four different calibration strategies generally the hydrological model performances were similar in terms of geographic distribution with better performances in wetter catchments than drier catchments nevertheless there were some obvious differences between those models gr4j and hmets with surface water groundwater interaction functions performed better than xaj and simhyd in terms of nse ln value this is consistent with pushpalatha et al 2011 and fleckenstein et al 2006 who found that the lumped model with the incorporation of groundwater exchange functions improves the predictions of low flows one of the other goals was to compare the nine multi model averaging methods overall gra grb grc and mmse with similar methods for optimal weight showed consistent performances and performed better than other combination methods grc with bias correction showed better performances in terms of pbias and pbiasfsv metrics than other combination methods and was considered as the best multi model averaging method for hydrological simulations in this study as aica and bica put all weights on the individual model with a minim root mean squareerror they performed similarly to the best performing individual model bga without the consideration of the biases from ensemble members only performed slightly better than ewa which is consistent with the previous study arsenault et al 2015 this study also found that bma which was widely used in previous ensemble studies li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 performs similarly to bga in terms of pbias baed evaluation metrics bma is recommended to apply on ensemble simulations whereas it is sometimes difficult to effectively remove bias from the predictions of complex streamflow simulation madadgar and moradkhani 2014 which is related to the poor performance in inters of pbias evaluations in addition this study found that adding ensemble members by either increasing hydrological models or increasing calibration strategies could improve the simulation abilities but the combinations of taking advantage of different hydrological models and objective functions were more robust and efficient in terms of different hydrological properties and hydro climatic regimes in addition this study found that the increase of ensemble members could obviously improve the multi model combination performance when the ensemble size is less than six but has limited effects when the ensemble size is more than nine this is consistent with kumar et al 2015 and arsenault et al 2015 who found that four and seven ensemble members are efficient for multi model combinations comparing the combinations and individual simulations the combinations of different hydrological models with various objective functions performed better than any individual model for around 70 of 383 catchments in terms of nse scores in contrast the combinations were less efficient than the best individual members in terms of low flow simulations this study also found that the multi model combinations perform better for wetter catchments than for drier catchments the frequencies of ensemble simulation outperforming the best individual simulation in terms of nse were 82 catchments in wetter regions with precipitation more than 600 mm year and 45 catchments in drier regions with precipitation less than 600 mm year credit authorship contribution statement yongjing wan conceptualization software formal analysis writing

equal weight is simply assigned to each of the ensemble members this is expressed mathematically as a1 w 1 n where n is the number of ensemble models 2 akaike and bayes information criteria averaging aica and bica aica akaike 1974 and bica schwarz 1978 methods combine ensemble members based on both performance and model complexity weight represents a trade off between reducing the simulated error while tending toward less complex which is calculated as a2 w exp 1 2 i i 1 n exp 1 2 i i where i is the information criterion estimated based on the mean of the logarithm of the ensemble member variances and the number of calibration parameters and is calculated as a3 i 2 log l q p where l and q p are the maximum likelihood of ensemble member and the penalty term respectively the difference between the aica and bica methods lies in the penalty term calculation the penalty terms of aica and bica are estimated by equations a4 and a5 a4 q 2 p a5 q p l o g k where p donates the number of calibrated parameters in the members and k donates the sample size here is the number of time steps 3 bates and granger averaging bga the bga bates and granger 1969 method aims to produce a combined

ramanathan a b and c gra grb and grc the gra granger and ramanathan 1984 approach minimizes the rmse setting weights based on the ordinary least squares ols algorithm the weights are estimated by a7 w q sim t q sim 1 q sim t q obs where q obs is the observation the grb variant is similar to the gra method but the ols algorithm is constrained such that the sum of the weights to unity the grc variant is unconstrained but the averaged streamflow is bias corrected through the use of a constant term 5 bayesian model averaging bma bma neuman 2003 determines the weights of each member through the use of the ensemble members probability distribution functions pdfs the combined distribution is bias corrected and the difference between the distributions is minimized according to bma the posterior

3933,the multi model combination is a technique to improve the performances of hydrological streamflow simulations an area that has not been investigated much is the performance dependence of combination techniques on the hydrological model calibration strategy and ensemble size this study aims at investigating the joint effect of the hydrological models calibration strategies and ensemble sizes on combination abilities for selecting the most appropriate multi model combination method the ensemble members were constructed by applying four hydrological models and four objective functions over 383 catchments in china the ensemble members were combined by using nine commonly used methods which are equal weights ewa akaike information criterion aica bayes information criterion bica bates and granger bga granger ramanathan a b and c gra grb and grc bayesian model averaging bma and multi model super ensemble mmse the grc is found as the best multi model combination method for hydrological simulations adding ensemble members by either multiple hydrological models or calibration strategies could help to improve the simulation abilities specifically the increase of ensemble members can obviously enhance the performance of multi model combinations when the ensemble size is less than six while only limited improvement is achieved when the ensemble size is more than nine the combination of ensemble members with various calibration strategies is hard to compensate for the weakness of hydrological model structures as well the application of a single calibration strategy in ensemble members only emphasizes single discharge periods and neglects other important discharge periods this study found that various models with different objective functions are more robust and efficient the combination performs better than any individual model in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for approximately 70 catchments but the multi model combination is less efficient in terms of low flow simulations keywords multi model combination method ensemble modeling calibration strategy ensemble size joint effect 1 introduction hydrological models are essential tools for addressing a wide spectrum of hydrological and water resources problems including water resources planning drought and flood control simulation at ungauged locations and impact studies for climate or land use changes kotsuki et al 2014 kudo et al 2017 lane et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 over the last decades a large number of hydrological models have been developed ranging from lumped conceptual models to physically based distributed models arnold et al 1998 chiew et al 2002 edijatno et al 1999 liang et al 1994 xu 2021 zhao et al 1980 the performance of those models varies for diverse catchments characterized by different climate land use and topography according to the strengths and weaknesses of the modeling mendoza et al 2016 pechlivanidis et al 2011 vansteenkiste et al 2014a zhang et al 2020 it is hard to determine a priori which model is most appropriate for a given application over widely differing characteristics of catchments a single model is not able to consistently outperform the others for all catchment characteristics and heterogeneous climatology arsenault et al 2015 kumar et al 2015 velazquez et al 2010 several studies arsenault et al 2015 velázquez et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 found that multi model combinations are more robust and efficient than their individual members with the concept of using ensemble to reducing errors with an optimal bias and variance trade off a wide range of methods can be used to generate a multi model combination solution the simplest example is the calculation of the arithmetic mean of the input models commonly referred to as the equal weights averaging ewa more sophisticated techniques employ weighted schemes with differential weightings applied to each input model reflecting their relative advantages or limitations there are some popular techniques used to obtain the optimal set weights for multi model combinations like multiple linear regression arsenault et al 2015 granger and ramanathan 1984 kumar et al 2015 machine learning algorithms jeong and kim 2009 shamseldin et al 1997 zaherpour et al 2019 bayesian model averaging neuman 2003 and information criterion averaging akaike 1974 schwarz 1978 the challenge in ensemble modeling is to determine the ensemble size and to identify the best averaging method arsenault et al 2015 buizza and palmer 1998 kumar et al 2015 many studies jeong and kim 2009 shamseldin et al 1997 sun and trevor 2018 zaherpour et al 2019 have attempted to identify the best multi model combination method for hydrological simulations shamseldin et al 1997 applied three methods simple arithmetic mean constrained ordinary least squares weighting and neural network to combine four hydrological models for 11 catchments and found the constrained ordinary least squares weighting and neural network are more robust and efficient than the simple arithmetic mean in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse broderick et al 2016 analyzed the performance of four ensemble averaging techniques using four hydrological models for 37 irish catchments they concluded that gra is the best ensemble averaging technique and the averaging methods performed better for the nse as opposed to bias metrics in addition some studies investigated the effect of ensemble size on the performance of multi model ensemble simulations for example arsenault et al 2015 compared nine multi model averaging approaches using 12 hydrographs 4 models 3 metrics over 429 catchments they found that grc performs better than other averaging methods and no catchment requiring more than seven ensemble members to maximize the nse with this method kumar et al 2015 compared ten different multi model ensemble methods using eight hydrological models to select the best multi model ensemble method for the discharge estimation over a catchment of the mahanadi river basin in india they showed that the constrained multiple linear regression is the most suitable multi model ensemble method in terms of nse root mean square error rmse and pearson s correlation coefficient r and five ensembles show the best performance for the study area the method of multi model combination is usually used to extract as much information as possible from a group of existing models which may produce a better overall simulation as each simulation of the group provides specific information in addition to the selection of the hydrological models the process of parameter identification is also a crucial step in streamflow modeling the calibration strategies which here mean choice of objective functions reflect the goodness of fitting between hydrological model simulations and observations which can substantially influence the model parameters and the streamflow projections krysanova et al 2018 lane et al 2019 mizukami et al 2019 seiller et al 2017 the hydrological models with various structures and calibration strategies have certain capacities to predict the streamflow in general the hydrological simulations achieve maximum accuracy in terms of specific hydrological properties using a particular metric but that might limit the modeling skill in other aspects arsenault et al 2015 mizukami et al 2019 seiller et al 2017 for example the most widely used calibration strategies such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge emphasize high flow events and their timing gupta et al 2009 mizukami et al 2019 nash and sutcliffe 1970 those metrics calculated on the natural logarithm of the flow values put more weight on low flows pushpalatha et al 2012 seiller et al 2017 the use of multi model combination scheme is expected to benefit from the variation of the parameter sets derived from objective functions targeted at different hydrological processes to produce a better overall simulation although the influence of calibration strategies exists in hydrological modeling the impacts of hydrological model calibration strategies on the performance of multi model combinations and their joint effects with ensemble sizes are not clear moreover there is no consensus in the hydrological community in terms of the selection of particular multi model ensemble sizes to ensure good model performances this study aims to investigate the joint effect of ensemble sizes and hydrological model calibration strategies on combination abilities for selecting the most appropriate multi model combination method specifically nine commonly used multi model combination techniques are compared over 383 catchments in china using ensemble members derived from 4 hydrological models calibrated with 4 objective functions the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a brief introduction of the study data and the methodology including the hydrological models the calibration strategies the multi model combination techniques and the details of the evaluation technique used in this study the results are presented in section 3 followed by the discussion and conclusion in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 study region and data this study used a gridded meteorological dataset 0 5 0 5 over china for the period of 1961 2016 which contains four climate variables including daily precipitation daily maximum minimum and mean air temperatures to represent observed data this dataset was generated from 2 472 in situ gauge stations across china by thin plate spline interpolation method and gtopo30 global 30 arc second elevation data sampling and is considered as the latest gridded meteorological data with the highest spatial resolution in china this dataset has been commonly used in many hydro climatological studies in china gu et al 2021 li et al 2019 yin et al 2020 and downloaded from the china meteorological data sharing service system http www cma gov cn the daily streamflow series over 383 catchments in china were used fig 1 these catchments with a wide range of climatic conditions and hydrological regimes span over all the nine major river basins in china based on climate type and physical geography this study region was divided into four major climate regions continental climate zone of northwest nw the highland climate zone of southwest tibetan plateau sw the temperate monsoon region of northeast ne and the tropical and subtropical monsoon region of southeast se ding 2013 wu et al 2016 ne is the driest region according to the average aridity index value fig 2 the size of the catchments ranges from 612 km2 to 995 343 km2 the streamflow dataset covers the 1961 2016 period with a maximum length of 52 years and a minimum length of 22 years the average annual precipitation of the catchment varies greatly with clear gradients depending on the region the mean annual precipitation is more than 1400 mm in the southern region while it is less than 600 mm in the northern region 2 2 hydrological models a wide range of hydrological models is used for different application purposes some studies compared the performance of lumped and distributed models for outlet streamflow simulation and found that two types of models may lead to similar accuracy kumar et al 2015 lobligeois et al 2014 vansteenkiste et al 2014b even for quite large catchments merz et al 2009 considering the scope of this study the lumped model the most common model type used by hydrologists for water resources assessment flood forecasting and impact of climate change studies was chosen and the distributed model with expensive computations was excluded four lumped models with different complexity were used i e modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j edijatno et al 1999 perrin et al 2003 hydrological model of école de technologie supérieure hmets martel et al 2017 simple hydrolog simhyd chiew et al 2002 and xinanjiang xaj zhao 1992 zhao et al 1980 those models have been widely used in streamflow simulation and have been shown to be relatively efficient arsenault et al 2015 broderick et al 2016 jones et al 2006 liang et al 2013 mathevet et al 2020 table 1 briefly summarized the basic information for these hydrological models the four models have different numbers of parameters and are different in model structures and underlying mechanisms for example the physical process is described in more detailed and complex mechanisms in hmets simhyd and xaj than in the most parsimonious structure gr4j with only four free parameters the main feature of the runoff generation of hmets and xaj is using the saturation excess flow mechanism based on the soil moisture content of the aeration zone reaching its field capacity while simhyd considers both infiltration excess runoff and saturation excess runoff in streamflow production calculated by an interception store a nonlinear soil moisture store for the simulation of evaporation xaj uses a three layer evaporation model while hmets and simhyd use a one layer model additionally gr4j and hmets consider the incorporation of groundwater exchange by surface water groundwater interaction functions but xaj and simhyd do not have this consideration since gr4j xaj and simhyd do not simulate snow accumulation or melt processes a snow module cemaneige with 2 free parameters valéry et al 2014 was combined with the original model to make it applicable in seasonally snow covered catchments in northern china the basic inputs of these four models are catchment averaged precipitation and temperature potential evapotranspiration over the entire basin for the computation of discharge the potential evapotranspiration was estimated using a temperature based method proposed by oudin et al 2006a 2 3 calibration and evaluation metrics this study used four objective functions to calibrate the four hydrological models over 383 catchments the four calibration strategies are the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nse computed on natural logarithm and square root of the flow values nse ln and nse sqrt and percent bias pbias nse nse ln and nse sqrt all range from negative infinity to 1 with a value of 1 indicating perfect fitting the pbias value being closer to zero indicates the better simulating performances different calibration strategies were included in the combination since they emphasize different aspects of hydrological streamflow properties the original nse without discharge transformation puts great emphasis on high flows li et al 2019 mizukami et al 2019 the natural logarithm of discharge transformation nse ln is to optimize the performance for low flow segments seiller et al 2017 the analysis of nse sqrt well balances simulated streamflow without too much emphasis on low or high flow oudin et al 2006b and the pbias emphasizes the total water balance regardless of the objective function the hydrological models optimized the parameter using the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 a cross validation method that divided the complete record of each catchment arsenault et al 2015 yang et al 2020 into odd and even years for model calibration and validation was used to reduce the influence from the non stationarity of hydro climatological conditions in this process the first year in the calibration period was used for model warm up in addition to using nse nse ln nse sqrt and pbias as evaluation metrics to represent the overall performance of simulations the high and low flows were also analyzed based on the discharge segments of flow duration curves fdc to identify the influence of ensemble method on the performance of various flow components following previous studies laaha and blöschl 2006 pfannerstill et al 2014 yilmaz et al 2008 the flow exceedance probability of 70 was used to represent the low flow and the mid flow segment was shifted from 20 to 70 the very high flow range was defined between 0 and 5 and the high flow range between 5 and 20 the performance of the model simulations within these fdc segments was analyzed using pbias pbiasfsv noted by pbiasfsv 5 pbiasfsv 20 pbiasfsv mid and pbiasfsv low the basic information of those metrics which were used for evaluating the performance of the different hydrograph phases was shown in table 2 2 4 multi model averaging methods there are several methods available in the literature for developing the multi model combination here we compared the performance of nine commonly used deterministic ensemble techniques for creating multi model ensembles the selected methods include equal weights averaging ewa akaike information criterion averaging aica bayes information criterion averaging bica bates and granger averaging bga granger ramanathan a averaging gra granger ramanathan b averaging grb granger ramanathan c averaging grc bayesian model averaging bma and multi model super ensemble mmse the general model for averaging methods can be expressed as q ens i 1 n w i q simi where q ens is the ensemble simulation q simi is the individual simulation and wi is the weight of the ensemble member a description of the selected averaging methods was given in the appendix the basic characteristics of the nine multi model averaging techniques were summarized in table 3 3 results 3 1 performance of the individual members the performances of the 16 ensemble members over 383 catchments in the calibration and validation were analyzed using the evaluation of nse nse ln nse sqrt and pbias representing the average simulated abilities and using the pbias of four different fdc segments pbiasfsv 5 pbiasfsv 20 pbiasfsv mid and pbiasfsv low representing the high and low flows as presented in fig 3 the result shows that the evaluation metrics in the validation period are consistent with those in the calibration period which indicates the hydrological simulations are robust and transferable the ensemble members with calibration strategies closely related to the evaluation metrics work best as expected models calibrated with nse sqrt maintain good performances in terms of nse and nse ln evaluation with median values around 0 7 and 0 8 all ensemble members show the absolute value of pbias being less than 10 but the models calibrated with pbias yield inferior performance in terms of nse based evaluation metrics according to the fdc segment evaluation values fig 3e 3 h the models calibrated with nse show good performance for high flow segments that obtain the best score for 38 and 42 of catchments in terms of the pbiasfsv 5 and pbiasfsv 20 respectively table 4 the models calibrated with nse ln put high weight on low flows and obtain the best score at a frequency of 42 catchments models calibrated with nse sqrt emphasize middle flows which obtain the best score at a frequency of 38 catchments those results confirmed the specialization of the objective functions for specific parts of the hydrographs this figure also demonstrates that hydrologic models perform differently with respect to different calibration strategies and evaluation metrics for example calibrated with nse both hmets and gr4j with median nse ln value of 0 6 perform better than simhyd and xaj with median nse ln value of 0 3 and 0 5 in addition hmets and gr4j tend to overestimate the midle and low flow segments while the other two models i e simhyd and xaj tend to underestimate those flows comparing the hydrological models xaj generally performs best for the evaluation metrics followed by hmets gr4j and simhyd when looking at four sub regions based on the median value of evaluation metrics fig 4 different models show similar spatial patterns in terms of nse based metrics with better performances in the wetter southern catchments sw and se than in drier northern catchments nw and ne however the performance of the four hydrological models is not the same gr4j and simhyd perform better than xaj and hmets in terms of nse based metrics over sw when using nse ln as the objective function 3 2 performance of the multi model averaging methods the nine multi model combination methods were applied to calculate the optimal weights based on the observed and the 16 simulated streamflow series the performance of those methods over 383 catchments in the validation period is presented in fig 5 the result shows that the differences of the ensemble simulations are evident not just in how well the averaging methods but also in the evaluation metrics used for nse metric almost all multi model combination methods show similar performances with median values around 0 8 except for ewa bga and bma with median values less than 0 75 for nse ln metric ewa bga and bma perform better than others with median values around 0 8 followed by gra grb and grc with median values around 0 75 almost all averaging methods show similar performances in terms of nse sqrt metric with median values exceeding 0 81 for pbias and pbiasfsv 5 gra grb grc and mmse show similar performances and outperform others followed by aica and bica for pbiasfsv 20 pbiasfsv mid and pbiasfsv low grc performs the best followed by gra grb and mmse in general all simulations tend to underestimate the high flow but overestimating the mid and low flows among various averaging methods gra grb grc and mmse show similar performance since they derived from the same optimal weighting group the aica and bica perform poorly in terms of nse ln and pbiasfsv low metrics compared with other averaging methods as they put almost all weights on the individual member with minimum rmse it can also be seen that the bma ewa and bga without bias correction show worse performances in terms of pbias based measures especially for pbias pbiasfsv 5 and pbiasfsv low overall the gra grb grc and mmse consistently outperformed other combination methods in terms of the eight evaluation metrics and grc provided the best performances especially in terms of pbias and pbiasfsv therefore grc is considered as the best multi model averaging method for hydrological simulations in this study 3 3 impact of the hydrological model calibration strategy and ensemble size on multi model combinations this section investigated the joint influence of the hydrological models calibration strategies and ensemble size on the performance of grc the selection of ensemble members is based on multiple hydrological models calibrated with a single objective function a single hydrological model calibrated with multiple objective functions and multiple hydrological models calibrated with multiple objective functions fig 6 shows the median performance value over 383 catchments in the validation period to represent the overall ability of those combinations the performance of multiple hydrological models calibrated with a single objective function varies depending on the selection of objective function and is improved along with the increase of hydrological model numbers areas numbered 2 in fig 6 areas numbered 3 in fig 6 show the performances of a hydrological model with multiple objective functions though using multiple objective functions could improve the combination abilities the performances still depend on the selection of hydrological models as each hydrological model has its own advantages and limitations for example the combinations based on simhyd generally perform worse than others in terms of nse and nse sqrt but perform better in terms of nse ln pbias and pbiasfsv low in addition a single model is not able to consistently outperform others for all catchments with various hydro climatic regimes the combinations of multiple hydrological models calibrated with various objective functions taking advantage of all ensemble members generally perform more robust and efficient than combinations only using a single calibration or a single hydrological model in terms of all nse based metrics areas numbered 4 in fig 6 overall either using multiple hydrological models or multiple calibration strategies could improve the multi model combination performances in terms of nse based metrics but is less efficient in pbias based evaluation metrics the above results also indicate that the influence of increasing hydrological models on combination is larger than increasing model calibration strategies and the effect of the individual simulation is decreasing along with the increase of ensemble members the qualitative comparison of different combinations and individual simulations would be analyzed later section 3 4 the combinations with ensemble sizes ranging from 2 to 16 ensemble members are generated by re sampling the ensemble members 100 times from all combination members to investigate the effect of ensemble size on simulating abilities fig 7 shows the relationship between the ensemble size and the combination performances the 0 05 and 0 25 quantiles of nse nse ln and nse sqrt values correspond to the poor efficiency modeling while 0 75 and 0 95 quantiles correspond to simulations with good performance the median performance is represented by quantile 0 50 red lines the absolute values of pbias and four pbiasfsv being infinite to zero indicating better performances this result indicates that the performance is improved along with the increase in ensemble sizes and the effect of ensemble size on the low quantile values is larger than that on the high quantile in general the performance of the multi model combinations is sensitive to the ensemble size and the selection of ensemble members when the member is less than six the influence of enlarging ensemble numbers on simulation performances could be ignored when the ensemble member is more than nine in other words when the ensemble member is more than nine neither enriching the hydrological model nor increasing calibration strategies show limited improvement in simulating abilities as larger ensemble sizes mean each individual member with smaller weights and limited influence on the combination in order to investigate whether all ensemble members contribute to the performance of the combination the frequency of the individual member being selected in the best performed combinations of all catchments is calculated and plotted in fig 8 here the ensemble sizes of the combinations are nine since the results from fig 7 concluded that the effect of increasing ensemble numbers more than nine could be ignored fig 8 shows that all individual members have similar chancies of being selected in the best performed combinations in terms of different evaluation metrics indicating all ensemble members contribute to enhancing the combination simulation 3 4 comparison of the multi model combination and ensemble members the performances of grc and the ensemble members were compared using the cumulative distributions of nse nse ln nse sqrt absolute values of pbias and pbiasfsv over the 383 catchments in the validation period fig 9 here five combinations are represented including four hydrological models calibrated with a specified objective function i e h4 nse h4 nse ln h4 nse sqrt and h4 pbias and four hydrological models calibrated with four calibration strategies i e h4c4 it is apparent that the multi model combinations either using multiple hydrological models or using multiple calibration strategies outperform the individual member in terms of those performance metrics except for nse ln and pbiasfsv low the combinations of four hydrological models calibrated with four calibration strategies perform the best and show 85 catchments have nse values exceeding 0 6 and 75 catchments have nse values exceeding 0 7 fig 9a in addition 91 catchments have nse sqrt values exceeding 0 6 and 73 catchments have nse sqrt values exceeding 0 7 fig 9b the absolute value of pbias is less than 10 for more than 95 catchments and that is less than 5 for 78 catchments in addition the absolute values of pbiasfsv 5 pbiasfsv 20 and pbiasfsv mid are less than 10 for 55 80 and 80 of catchments respectively however the combinations are less efficient in terms of nse ln and pbiasfsv low evaluation than the individual members using nse ln calibration since the averaging methods based on minimum rmse are more sensitive to flood peaks than low flow period table 5 shows the rate at which the averaging simulation surpasses the best individual member in terms of four average performance metrics and four fdc segment metrics over the 383 catchments in the validation period here the best individual member value is selected from the 16 members independently for each catchment the results show that four hydrological models calibrated with four calibrations h4c4 perform more robustly than other combinations in terms of various performance metrics the combination of four hydrological models calibrated with a specified objective only performs efficiently for the specific parts of the hydrographs the combinations perform better than the best individual member for about 70 catchments in terms of nse and for about 55 catchments in terms of nse sqrt on the contrary combinations show less efficiency for performance values in terms of nse ln and pbias fig 10 a and b show the geographic distribution of the nse value in the validation period from the best individual member and combinations the spatial patterns are consistent with better performances in the wetter southern catchments than in the drier northern catchments for catchments with annual precipitation larger than 600 mm 82 catchments obtain nse value exceeding 0 7 and the combination outperforms the best individual in 82 cases however for catchments with annual precipitation less than 600 mm only 51 catchments obtain nse value exceeding 0 7 and the combinations outperform the best individual only in 45 cases fig 10c and d since hydrological simulations are big challenges for the arid catchments especially when using lumped models which cannot represent the rainfall and loss variability that tends to be higher the multi model combinations have less benefit when the ensemble members cannot accurately simulate the streamflow 4 discussion and conclusion the multi model combination is a technique widely used to improve the performance of hydrological streamflow simulations as it extracts potentially useful information from a group of existing models the commonly used multi model combination usually takes information from different hydrological models while neglects the additional information from calibration strategies this study investigated the joint effect of hydrological models calibration strategies and ensemble sizes on combination abilities for selecting the appropriate multi model combination method this study compared different multi model ensemble methods by combining the simulated discharge with four hydrological models and four different calibration strategies generally the hydrological model performances were similar in terms of geographic distribution with better performances in wetter catchments than drier catchments nevertheless there were some obvious differences between those models gr4j and hmets with surface water groundwater interaction functions performed better than xaj and simhyd in terms of nse ln value this is consistent with pushpalatha et al 2011 and fleckenstein et al 2006 who found that the lumped model with the incorporation of groundwater exchange functions improves the predictions of low flows one of the other goals was to compare the nine multi model averaging methods overall gra grb grc and mmse with similar methods for optimal weight showed consistent performances and performed better than other combination methods grc with bias correction showed better performances in terms of pbias and pbiasfsv metrics than other combination methods and was considered as the best multi model averaging method for hydrological simulations in this study as aica and bica put all weights on the individual model with a minim root mean squareerror they performed similarly to the best performing individual model bga without the consideration of the biases from ensemble members only performed slightly better than ewa which is consistent with the previous study arsenault et al 2015 this study also found that bma which was widely used in previous ensemble studies li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 performs similarly to bga in terms of pbias baed evaluation metrics bma is recommended to apply on ensemble simulations whereas it is sometimes difficult to effectively remove bias from the predictions of complex streamflow simulation madadgar and moradkhani 2014 which is related to the poor performance in inters of pbias evaluations in addition this study found that adding ensemble members by either increasing hydrological models or increasing calibration strategies could improve the simulation abilities but the combinations of taking advantage of different hydrological models and objective functions were more robust and efficient in terms of different hydrological properties and hydro climatic regimes in addition this study found that the increase of ensemble members could obviously improve the multi model combination performance when the ensemble size is less than six but has limited effects when the ensemble size is more than nine this is consistent with kumar et al 2015 and arsenault et al 2015 who found that four and seven ensemble members are efficient for multi model combinations comparing the combinations and individual simulations the combinations of different hydrological models with various objective functions performed better than any individual model for around 70 of 383 catchments in terms of nse scores in contrast the combinations were less efficient than the best individual members in terms of low flow simulations this study also found that the multi model combinations perform better for wetter catchments than for drier catchments the frequencies of ensemble simulation outperforming the best individual simulation in terms of nse were 82 catchments in wetter regions with precipitation more than 600 mm year and 45 catchments in drier regions with precipitation less than 600 mm year credit authorship contribution statement yongjing wan conceptualization software formal analysis writing

equal weight is simply assigned to each of the ensemble members this is expressed mathematically as a1 w 1 n where n is the number of ensemble models 2 akaike and bayes information criteria averaging aica and bica aica akaike 1974 and bica schwarz 1978 methods combine ensemble members based on both performance and model complexity weight represents a trade off between reducing the simulated error while tending toward less complex which is calculated as a2 w exp 1 2 i i 1 n exp 1 2 i i where i is the information criterion estimated based on the mean of the logarithm of the ensemble member variances and the number of calibration parameters and is calculated as a3 i 2 log l q p where l and q p are the maximum likelihood of ensemble member and the penalty term respectively the difference between the aica and bica methods lies in the penalty term calculation the penalty terms of aica and bica are estimated by equations a4 and a5 a4 q 2 p a5 q p l o g k where p donates the number of calibrated parameters in the members and k donates the sample size here is the number of time steps 3 bates and granger averaging bga the bga bates and granger 1969 method aims to produce a combined

3934,effectively and efficiently protecting groundwater resources requires a better understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry and their controlling factors natural and anthropogenic in this study to reveal the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry we explored two clustering methods i e the one way clustering implemented by using the hierarchical cluster analysis hca and the co clustering implemented by using the bregman block average co clustering algorithm with i divergence bbac i the one way clustering identifies the spatial and temporal patterns separately whereas the co clustering identifies the spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously the two clustering methods were applied to 9 geochemical parameters of 329 groundwater samples collected over the period of 2000 2017 from 19 monitoring wells located in the unconfined aquifer of the dagu river basin china as a first attempt of applying bbac i co clustering to groundwater geochemical data results show that it is feasible to use the bbac i co clustering method for simultaneously identifying location and timestamp clusters the clusters identified by the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering are similar based on the clustering results two geochemical zones and three geochemical periods of groundwater geochemistry were delineated the controlling factors of the two geochemical zones are residual seawater freshening elevated no3 concentrations and silicate weathering the temporal changes between the three geochemical periods are caused by a heavy rainfall in july 2011 after a one year drought and by ceased flow of the dagu river after 2013 due to drought conditions the impacts of drought conditions and anthropogenic activities in the dagu river basin on groundwater geochemistry should be considered for managing groundwater resources of the basin keywords dagu river basin residual seawater refreshening drought fertilizer nitrogen 1 introduction understanding spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry and their controlling factors natural and anthropogenic is imperative to protecting groundwater resources gaining such understanding demands a large amount of groundwater geochemistry data at the regional scale over a long period of groundwater monitoring in the last couple of decades long term monitoring data of groundwater geochemistry in regional aquifers have become available and statistical analysis has been performed to understand the spatio temporal patterns embedded in the data e g li et al 2021 jessen et al 2017 rakotondrabe et al 2018 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2021 wei et al 2021 yang et al 2021 a commonly used statistical method is cluster analysis that separates data into a number of clusters each of which has similar geochemical features so that insights on spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry can be gained by studying the clusters e g pacheco castro et al 2018 pant et al 2018 wu et al 2020a sayemuzzaman et al 2018 yang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the clusters can be categorized into two kinds i e location clusters and timestamp clusters the location clusters indicate which monitoring wells can be classified into one cluster and thus reveal spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry the timestamp clusters indicate which sampling campaigns can be classified into one cluster and thus reveal temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry obtaining the location and timestamp clusters is necessary for advancing our understanding of spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry this study explores the one way clustering and co clustering methods for cluster analysis of groundwater geochemistry the one way clustering produces the location and timestamp clusters separately whereas the co clustering produces the location and timestamp clusters simultaneously detailed differences between the two methods are elaborated by using fig 1 as shown in fig 1 a the groundwater geochemical data are generally three dimensional because multiple geochemical parameters are measured for groundwater samples collected from multiple monitoring wells at multiple sampling campaigns for conducting a statistical analysis the three dimensional dataset is always converted into a two dimensional dataset shown in fig 1 b the rows of the dataset are monitoring wells at different sampling campaigns and the columns are the geochemical parameters the one way clustering uses various clustering methods e g hierarchical cluster analysis hca or k means to determine the number of clusters and the cluster memberships i e well w at sampling campaign t belonging to cluster c as shown in fig 1 c based on the cluster index the final products of the one way clustering are the location frequency table shown in fig 1 d and the timestamp frequency table shown in fig 1 e the location frequency table lists the number of groundwater samples belonging to each cluster for each well over all sampling campaigns and this table can be used to understand spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry e g delineating groundwater geochemical zones the timestamp frequency table lists the number of groundwater samples belong to each cluster for each sampling campaign over all monitoring wells and this table can be used to understand temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry e g identifying a transition period of groundwater geochemistry due to natural and or anthropogenic reasons the one way clustering is a traditional approach for analyzing groundwater geochemical data for example hca has been commonly used to partition sampling locations into location clusters e g de brito neto et al 2016 wu et al 2020a sayemuzzaman et al 2018 pant et al 2018 however there are only few studies that used hca to partition sampling campaigns into timestamp clusters e g yu et al 2017 yang et al 2020 a potential problem of the one way clustering is that the spatial and temporal patterns are identified separately whereas groundwater geochemistry evolves in space and time simultaneously different from the one way clustering that produces the location and timestamp clusters separately the co clustering produces the location and timestamp clusters simultaneously as shown in fig 1 h this is achieved by iteratively assigning monitoring wells to the location clusters and the sampling campaigns to the timestamp clusters and the final clusters are obtained by minimizing a distortion function defined to measure the difference between the data before and after performing the co clustering there are multiple distortion functions and a review of the functions is referred to banerjee et al 2007 this study used the bregman block average co clustering method with the i divergence bbac i developed by dhillon et al 2003 bbac i uses the i divergence also known as kullback leibler divergence due to its superiority as demonstrated by banerjee et al 2007 bbac i has been used for environmental studies recently wu et al 2015 applied bbac i to daily temperature data collected at 28 weather stations in dutch from 1992 to 2011 to understand the spatio temporal patterns of temperature wu et al 2016 applied bbac i to a long term time series of first leaf dates over europe from 1950 to 2011 to study spatio temporal patterns in spring phenology wu et al 2020b further used bbac i to explore the spatial patterns of first bloom date in china and their temporal dynamics for 40 years from 1979 to 2018 python codes for general purpose co clustering were recently developed by role et al 2019 bbac i has not been applied to groundwater geochemical data and this study is the first attempt of using bbac i for co clustering to understand spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry this study aims to answer the following two questions 1 can bbac i be applied to a three dimensional dataset of groundwater geochemistry for understanding spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry 2 what are the advantages and disadvantages of the co clustering in comparison with the one way clustering with respect to understanding spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry the two questions are tackled by applying the two clustering methods to the groundwater geochemistry data collected from the unconfined aquifer of the dagu river basin china fig 2 groundwater of this aquifer accounts for about 70 of freshwater resources in the basin and provides 30 70 of water supply for drinking water and agriculture and industrial uses qingdao water resources bureau 2019 recent studies fang et al 2020 liu et al 2017 yu et al 2020 yin et al 2021 have shown that groundwater quality of this aquifer has deteriorated over time due to overexploitation xiong et al 2020 seawater intrusion chen and zheng 2015 liu et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 anthropogenic contaminants e g fertilizer nitrogen this study differs from the previous studies on the following two aspects 1 we use both hca one way clustering and bbac i co clustering methods for understanding spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry which has not been attempted for the dagu river basin and 2 the groundwater geochemical data used in this study include 327 groundwater samples collected from 19 monitoring wells over a long monitoring period of 18 years the number of samples is significantly larger than those used in previous studies the clustering analysis of this study advances our understanding on the spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry and the controlling factors of the patterns in the unconfined aquifer and the findings of this study are expected to be useful for effective and efficient management of groundwater resources in the aquifer 2 study area and groundwater geochemical data 2 1 study area the dagu river basin is located in the shangdong province china fig 2 a and the dagu river flows into the jiaozhou bay fig 2 c this area is under a temperate continental climate with hot rainy summers and cold dry winters the annual average temperature rainfall and evaporation are 12 c 692 mm and 960 mm respectively the annual precipitation ranges from 407 mm to 1 353 mm and nearly 45 of the annual precipitation occurs in july and august daily temperature and precipitation data over the period of 1990 2015 are available at the qingdao meteorological station managed by the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn accessed as of 5 10 2021 as shown in fig 2 b the land use types of this area are characterized by croplands dominated by vegetable cropping in the north part and wheat cropping in the south part of the basin yu et al 2020 the unconfined aquifer in the dagu river basin has a quaternary alluvial proluvial double layer structure xiong et al 2020 the upper layer is 2 4 m thick and composed of clayey sand and sandy clay with low permeability the lower layer is 4 8 m thick and composed of sand and gravel with high permeability zhang et al 2020 groundwater in the aquifer is mainly stored in the lower layer beneath the lower layer is impermeable cretaceous siltstones and clay rocks fang et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 c the regional groundwater flow direction in the unconfined aquifer is from north to south following the land surface topography the main source of groundwater recharge to the unconfined aquifer is precipitation accounting for 65 of the total recharge followed by river recharge 25 and irrigation 10 qingdao water resources bureau 2019 the river recharge of groundwater from the river occurs only during monsoon seasons from july to september in the wet years as the river is non perennial for the aquifer s discharge 90 of it is water exploitation for drinking agricultural and industrial uses wen et al 2017 because the unconfined aquifer is recharged by precipitation directly temporal variation of the aquifer s water level is largely controlled by temporal variation of precipitation and this is illustrated in fig 3 this figure plots the groundwater level measured every five days at wells w9 and w15 see the well locations in fig 2 c and the daily precipitation measured at the qingdao meteorological station see its location in fig 2 c the temporal variation of groundwater levels in general matches that of precipitation for instance the continuous decline of groundwater level after 2010 corresponds to the negative 12 month standardized precipitation index spi 12 mckee et al 1993 after 2010 whichwas calculated based on the precipitation data to characterize meteorological droughts the interaction between groundwater and precipitation is important to the temporal evolution of groundwater geochemistry in the unconfined aquifer previous studies have revealed a number of factors that control spatial temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry of the unconfined aquifer one controlling factor of the spatial patterns is the seawater intrusion that occurred 1990 s in 1998 a 4 km long underground cutoff wall was built at the location of the red line shown in fig 2 c downstream of the dagu river xiong et al 2020 found that while groundwater south to the cutoff wall is still seriously affected by seawater intrusion groundwater north to the cutoff wall is not indicating that the cutoff wall effectively stopped seawater intrusion another controlling factor of the spatial patterns is nitrogen pollution from multiple sources fang et al 2020 found that the nitrogen source in the central and northern regions of the basin is fertilizer nitrogen based on an isotope study yu et al 2020 found that in the south region of the basin nitrogen is also from soil manure and sewage with respect to the spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry yin et al 2021 divided the dagu river basin into three spatial zones i e the upper middle and lower reaches and the monitoring period of 2001 2017 into three stages i e stage i from 2001 to 2006 stage ii from 2007 to 2012 and stage iii from 2013 to 2017 the three spatial zones and three temporal stages of yin et al 2021 based on their best professional judgement are different from the two geochemical zones and three geochemical periods of this study based on the hca one way clustering and bbac i co clustering methods yin et al 2021 found that mineral dissolution precipitation cation exchange and human inputs e g nitrogen fertilizer livestock manure and sewage from industrial and domestic sources are the controlling factors of the spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry in the basin these previous studies provide the basis of geochemical analysis for evaluating and understanding the clustering results of this study it should be noted that the geochemical analysis of this study was conducted for each geochemical zone and each geochemical period the controlling factors of the two geochemical zones are residual seawater freshening elevated no3 concentrations and silicate weathering the temporal changes between the three geochemical periods are caused by a heavy rainfall in july 2011 after a one year drought and by ceased flow of the dagu river after 2013 due to drought conditions these findings are complementary to those of previous studies and provide an in depth understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution of groundwater geochemistry in the dagu river basin 2 2 groundwater geochemical data during 2000 2017 a total of 378 groundwater samples were collected from 19 monitoring wells screened at the unconfined aquifer the well locations are shown in fig 2 c the sampling months and years are listed in table s1 in the supplementary information file thirteengroundwater geochemical parameters were measured and they are alkalinity total hardness total dissolved solids tds ph ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and f alkalinity total hardness and tds were excluded from the clustering for this study because the three parameters can be derived or approximated from the other 10 parameters appelo and postma 2005 the remaining 10 parameters including major cations and anions are commonly used for characterizing groundwater geochemistry among the 378 groundwater samples 43 samples did not have measurements of hco3 no3 andf see table s1 and were thus excluded from further analysis for the remaining 335samples 136samples have thesum of na and k concentrations not their individual concentrations in order to maximize the data use the sumof na and k concentrations denoted as nak hereinafter was used in the cluster analysis for all the 335 samples among the 335 samples 199 samples have separated na and k concentrations and the averageconcentrations of na and k are 146 9 mg l and 14 1 mg l respectively the large difference may indicate certain disadvantage of using the sum of na and k concentrations the charge balance errorwas calculated for the 199 samples with separated na and k concentrations following previous studies e g ghesquière et al 2015 yang et al 2020 eightsamples see table s1 with charge balance error higher than 10 were excluded from the clustering as a result the dataset used for the cluster analysis includes 327 groundwater samples with 9 geochemical parameters i e ph ca2 mg2 nak cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and f 3 methodology this section introduces the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering methods although graphical methods such as stiff diagram stiff 1951 hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d giménez forcada 2010 2019 and gaillardet diagram gaillardet et al 1999 were also used in this study for understanding the groundwater geochemistry details of these methods are not given in this paper but referred to the references above the hca analysis was performed by using python libraries scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 and scipy jones et al 2001 the bbac i co clustering analysis was performed by using the clustering geo data cubes package nattino et al 2019 the python codes and groundwater geochemical data used in this study are available on github at https github com jyangfsu clustering dagu 3 1 hca one way clustering method hca with the ward method is an agglomerative approach to separate data into clusters hca starts by treating each sample as a cluster and then merges the clusters stepwise to generate larger clusters at each step of merging two clusters are merged into one according to the ward criterion with the smallest increase of sum of squared errors the merging procedure continues until only one cluster remains to contain all samples this produces a dendrogram that presents the linkage distance between merged clusters the number of clusters and associated cluster membership of data i e which sample belonging to which cluster are commonly determined by placing a so called phenon line at a linkage distance since hca has been well documented in statistical books such as rencher 2003 we do not present more details of the method but focus on the hca based one way cluster analysis for the groundwater geochemistry data of this study following yang et al 2020 the 327 groundwater samples with 9 parameters were organized into a data matrix with 327 rows and 9 columns as shown in fig 1 b the natural log transformation and z score standardization which are typical for geochemical data clustering templ et al 2008 were applied to the data applying hca to the data yields the cluster index as shown in fig 1 c the clustering results were validated by using the principal component analysis pca to project the high dimensional geochemical data into low dimensional typically two dimensional maps pacheco castro et al 2018 yang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 if the number of the clusters and the cluster membership are appropriate the low dimensional maps show clear separation between the clusters based on the hca produced cluster index for the groundwater samples the location frequency table fig 1 d and the timestamp frequency table fig 1 e were generated to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry table 1 is the location frequency table used in this study and it was generated by counting the number of samples that fall into each cluster for each well studying the spatial distribution of the clusters can reveal spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry if the groundwater geochemistry is stable over time all the samples from one well would belong to one cluster this however is not the case as shown in table 1 because groundwater geochemistry changes over time and samples from one well may belong to more than one cluster the timestamp frequency table for sampling campaigns is thus needed for understanding the temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry table 2 is the timestamp frequency table used in this study and it was produced by counting the number of wells belonging to each cluster for each sampling campaign over all monitoring wells tracking the temporal changes of the frequency can reveal temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry 3 2 bbac i co clustering method the bbac i co clustering method can be applied to a two dimensional data matrix with positive element values since this method has not been applied to geochemical studies we below briefly describe this method for matrix o s t of data collected in space and time with the size of m n for m monitoring wells s and n sampling campaigns t bbac i uses an optimization process to convert the original data matrix o s t to a co clustered data matrix o s t where s and t denote the clustered location sets and timestamp sets respectively the size of o s t is k l where k is the number of location clusters and l is the number of timestamp clusters bbac i first randomly assigns the monitoring wells to the location clusters and the sampling campaigns to the timestamp clusters matrix r of size m k is used to denote the location cluster membership if the i th i 1 2 m monitoring well belongs to the j th j 1 2 k location cluster the corresponding element value in matrix r is set as one all other elements of matrix r are set as zeros see fig 1 h for example similarly a binary matrix denoted as c of size n l is used to denote the timestamp cluster membership based on matrices r c and o the co clustered data matrix o s t is constructed as nattino et al 2019 1 o s t r t o s t c r t ec where operator is the hadamard division i e the element wise division between two matrices e is the identity matrix that has the same size of o s t and the superscript t of r t denotes the matrix transpose the elements in the co clustered data matrix o s t are cluster based means matrix o s t is further used to construct matrix a s t as 2 a s t r o s t c t the loss in mutual information before and after the co clustering is measured by using the i divergence d i between matrices o s t and a s t defined as wu et al 2015 3 d i o s t a s t s 1 k t 1 l s s t t o s t log o s t a s t where o s t and a s t are elements of o s t and a s t respectively d i is minimized by iteratively adjusting the cluster memberships in matrices of r and c for the monitoring wells and sampling campaigns banerjee et al 2007 showed that d i can monotonically decrease and converge to a local minimum details of minimizing d i can be found in wu et al 2015 the final results of bbac i are matrix r of size m k for the location cluster membership m monitoring wells for k clusters and matrix c of size n l for the timestamp cluster membership n sampling campaigns for l clusters fig 1 h bbac i cannot be directly applied to the groundwater geochemistry data for co clustering due to four issues we first describe the four issues and then offer our empirical solutions to the issues the first issue is that the data matrix o s t cannot have any empty elements for the sake of estimating the loss in mutual information defined in equation 3 this requirement is not always satisfied for groundwater geochemical data because certain wells may not be sampled over certain sampling campaigns as shown in table s1 to resolve this issue we suggest removing such a well and a campaign from the data matrix for co clustering the second issue is that bbac i can only be used for co clustering a two dimensional data matrix but not a three dimensional matrix such as that discussed above for a number of geochemical parameters of groundwater samples collected from multiple wells over multiple sampling campaigns to resolve this issue we suggest first organizing the three dimensional matrix as the two dimensional matrix as shown in fig 1 b and then applying pca to the two dimensional data as shown in fig 1 f the third issue is that bbac i requires that all the elements of o s t are positive for the sake of evaluating the loss of mutual information defined in equation 3 but certain pc1 scores may be negative to resolve this issue we suggest applying the min max normalization y y min y max y min ε to convert negative pc1 scores into positive values where y represents the original pc1 scores y min and y max denote the minimum and maximum values of pc1 scores respectively and ε denotes a small value 10 8 in this study used for all samples to ensure that all values are positive the last issue is that the numbers of location and timestamp clusters i e k and l need to be specified for bbac i a priori but these numbers are unknown for real world problems our solution in this study is to use the numbers determined by the hca one way clustering which are reliable and physically reasonable as discussed below it should be noted that the solutions provided above are empirical and evaluating their potential impacts on bbac i is warranted in a future study 4 results 4 1 hca one way classification fig 4 shows the dendrogram of the hca classification for the 327 groundwater samples the phenon line drawn at the linkage distance of 20 led to four clusters denoted as c1 c4 to examine geochemical dissimilarity of the four clusters the stiff diagrams of the four clusters are plotted in fig 4 by using mean concentrations of eight geochemical parameters of the clusters cluster c1 has a distinctive shape with elevated mean concentrations of na k and cl the mean concentration of no3 of cluster c1 is significantly smaller than those of the other three clusters the stiff diagram of cluster c3 are different from those of clusters c2 and c4 in that cluster c3 s mean concentrations of ca2 and hco3 are larger than the mean concentrations of other cations and anions the stiff diagrams of clusters c2 and c4 have a similar shape except that the mean concentrations of cluster c2 are larger than those of cluster c4 fig 5 plots the boxplots of all the nine groundwater geochemical parameters to better understand the geochemical characteristics of the four clusters cluster c1 is characterized by high mean ph and high mean concentrations of nak cl so4 2 and hco3 but low mean concentrations of ca2 and no3 cluster c2 is characterized by the highest mean concentrations of ca2 and the second highest mean concentrations of so4 2 and mg2 among the four clusters cluster c3 is characterized by relatively lowest mean concentrations of ca2 and mg2 but relatively high mean concentration of hco3 cluster c4 is characterized by low mean concentrations of all the parameters except ca2 mg2 and no3 the boxplots qualitatively support the classification of the four clusters fig 6 shows the pca visualization performed to further examine whether the classification of the four clusters is reasonable for the pca analysis based on the kaiser criterion kaiser 1960 the first two principal components pcs with eigenvalues greater than one were selected as shown in fig s1 a of the supplementary information file the first principal component pc1 explains 33 of the total variance and the second principal component pc2 explains 21 of the total variance based on the first two pc scores fig 6 shows that the four clusters are reasonably separated with a marginal overlap indicating that the cluster classification is reasonable with respect to grouping the groundwater geochemical measurements 4 2 two frequency tables based on the hca clustering results the location frequency table table 1 and timestamp frequency table table 2 were generated to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of the groundwater geochemistry respectively table 1 lists the number of groundwater samples and the corresponding relative frequency of each cluster for the individual wells taking well w1 as an example ten samples were collected from this well over the 18 year monitoring period for the ten samples four and six samples belong to clusters c2 and c4 respectively and the corresponding relative frequency values are 4 10 40 and 6 10 60 a larger frequency indicates more stable groundwater geochemistry and a value of 100 means that the groundwater geochemistry does not change over time of the 19 wells only three wells w9 w16 and w19 have a relative frequency larger than 80 indicating that the groundwater geochemistry of the unconfined aquifer changes dramatically over time due to the controlling factors discussed in sections 5 and 6 table 2 lists the number of samples in each cluster for the individual sampling campaigns and the relative frequencies of the four clusters are also listed taking the sampling campaign of 2001 6 june 2001 and this notation is used throughout the paper as an example among the seven groundwater samples collected from seven monitoring wells one sample belongs to cluster c1 three samples to cluster c2 and three samples to cluster c4 the corresponding relative frequencies are 14 1 7 43 3 7 and 43 3 7 if the total number of samples is less than five for a sampling campaign the relative frequency was not calculated for each sampling campaign the relative frequency changes between clusters indicating spatial variability of groundwater geochemistry the sampling campaign of 2012 9 is an extreme case that all samples belong to cluster c3 the relative frequency also changes between sampling campaigns indicating that it is necessary to study the joint variation of groundwater geochemistry in space and time 4 3 bbac i co clustering results to apply the bbac i co clustering to the groundwater geochemical data of dagu river basin six wells w1 w12 w16 w17 w18 and w19 were excluded because a lot of samples were not collected for these wells table s1 sampling campaigns of 2000 9 and 2001 6 were also excluded because only 1 and 7 samples were collected respectively in the two sampling campaigns for the campaign of 2005 4 although groundwater samples were not collected from wells w7 w8 and w10 this sampling campaign was retained so that the data of this sampling campaign can be utilized in bbac i co clustering for the three wells the average concentrations based on those of campaigns of 2004 9 and 2006 9 were used for the campaign of 2005 4 similarly since groundwater samples were not collected from wells w13 and w14 during the sampling campaign of 2013 7 the average concentrations based on those of 2012 9 and 2013 10 were used for the two wells the remaining 299 groundwater samples collected from 13 monitoring wells during 23 sampling campaigns were used for bbac i co clustering organizing the data of 9 geochemical parameters in the manner shown in fig 1 a led to a three dimensional matrix with the size of 13 23 9 the natural log transformation and z score standardization were also applied to the data then pca was the applied to the data to extract the first principal component scores pc1 scores for the pca results of this study pc1 pc4 explain 25 20 13 and 11 of data variation the first principal component scores pc1 scores were used to represent the maximum possible information of the original groundwater geochemical data and the pc1 score was organized as the two dimensional matrix shown in fig 1 g the two dimensional data was used as o s t for bbac i co clustering the size of o s t is 13 23 corresponding to the selected 13 monitoring wells and 23 sampling campaigns for the bbac i co clustering the number of location clusters and the number of timestamp clusters were both set as three based on the location frequency table table 1 and the timestamp frequency table table 2 and the reasons are given in sections 5 and 6 the co clustering results are shown in fig 7 using a heatmap as a matrix in the manner of fig 1 h the three location clusters were denoted as l1 l2 and l3 and the three timestamp clusters were denoted as p1 p2 and p3 location cluster l1 contains wells w2 w5 w6 w10 and w15 l2 contains wells w3 w4 w7 w8 w9 w11 and w13 and l3 only contains well w14 for the three timestamp clusters timestamp cluster p1 includes all the sampling campaigns of 2002 9 2011 4 except the campaign of 2009 4 this campaign belongs to timestamp cluster p3 and p3 includes all the sampling campaigns of 2013 7 2017 10 timestamp cluster p2 includes there consecutive sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 5 discussion on spatial patterns and their controlling factors 5 1 spatial patterns identified by the two clustering methods examining table 1 of location frequency and fig 2 c of well locations reveals the following spatial pattens 1 the samples of cluster c1 are mainly from wells w17 and w19 located north to the cutoff wall 2 the samples of cluster c2 are mainly from wells w5 w6 w14 w15 w16 and w18 and the latter four wells are located north to the wells of cluster c1 3 the samples of cluster c3 are mainly from wells w13 and w14 located north to the wells of cluster c2 and 4 the samples of cluster c4 are mainly from wells w1 w12 located north to the wells of cluster c3 therefore the overall spatial pattern is that the wells of clusters c1 c4 are located from south to north along the direction from the downgradient to the upgradient of groundwater flow in the study area for the wells of cluster c1 c4 because wells w17 and w19 of cluster c1 were excluded from the co clustering analysis as explained in section 3 2 the number of the location clusters used for the bbac i co clustering was thus set as three rather than four fig 7 shows that the three location clusters l1 l3 produced by bbac i co clustering are generally consistent with the three clusters c2 c4 produced by the hca one way clustering generally speaking location cluster l1 corresponds to cluster c2 location cluster l2 to cluster c4 and location cluster l3 to cluster c3 however discrepancy between the wells of l1 l3 and the wells of c2 c4 is noticed for example wells w13 and w14 belong to cluster c3 of the hca one way clustering but according to the bbac i co clustering w13 and w14 belongs to clusters l2 and l3 respectively the discrepancy is not surprising because the bbac i co clustering used less data than the hca one way clustering did as explained in section 3 2 in addition only the pc1 scores were used for bbac i co clustering and certain information of the groundwater geochemistry in other pcs may lose more discussion on these issues is given in section 7 5 2 two geochemical zones and their controlling factors based on the results of hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering the unconfined aquifer of the dagu river basin was divided into the following two geochemical zones the downgradient residual seawater freshening zone that consists of the wells of clusters c1 and c2 and the upgradient fertilizer nitrogen zone that consists of wells of clusters c3 and c4 the estimated boundary of the two zones is shown in fig 2 c there are three controlling factors of the two groundwater geochemical zones and they are residual seawater freshening in the downgradient zone elevated no3 concentrations due to anthropogenic activity in the entire aquifer and agricultural fertilizer uses in the upgradient zone and silicate weathering due to water rock interaction over the entire aquifer 5 2 1 residual seawater freshening the residual seawater is referred to the seawater that entered the aquifer before the cutoff wall was built in 1998 and the high concentrations of nak and cl at wells w17 and w19 of cluster c1 are attributed to the residual seawater the residual seawater is being continuously freshened by groundwater that flows from north to south fig 2 c to understand the residual seawater refreshening the hfe d gimenez forcada 2010 was used to identify different hydrochemical facies produced during the stages of seawater intrusion and freshening fig 8 the diagram considers the percentage values of the four most significant ions i e ca2 or mg2 na k cl and so4 2 or hco3 co3 2 considering that na and cl are the dominant ions in seawater and that ca2 and hco3 are typically dominant ions in fresh water fig 8 shows the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram used in this study with a total of 16 hydrochemical facies e g na cl for seawater and ca hco3 so4 for fresh groundwater the conservative mixing line between fresh groundwater and seawater was generated by using the concentrations of the two end members the concentrations of seawater in jiaozhou bay were taken from liu et al 2019 since concentrations of fresh groundwater are not available we followed giménez forcada 2010 2019 to use the highest percentages of ca2 or mg2 and hco3 or so4 2 the diagram shows the intrusion process in which the groundwater type evolves from ca hco3 so4 face 13 to ca cl face 16 and ultimately to na cl face 4 the freshening process shown in the diagram is opposite and the groundwater type evolves from na cl face 4 to na hco3 face 1 and ultimately to ca hco3 so4 face 13 the 191 groundwater samples with separated na and k concentrations were plotted in fig 8 to illustrate the refreshening process of the residual seawater generally speaking the samples of clusters c1 and c2 are distributed along the direction of freshening since the samples of the two clusters are mainly from wells w14 w19 located at the south end of the dagu river basin fig 2c it is likely that the residual seawater is freshened by the regional groundwater flowing from north to south this is evidenced by the groundwater geochemistry evolution from the na cl type to the ca hco3 so4 type along the dashed blue line shown in fig 8 that connects wells w19 w17 w16 w15 and w14 located from south to north in the downgradient area of the aquifer the freshening process is continuous as evidenced by the red solid line shown in fig 8 that connects the groundwater geochemical data at well w19 from the sampling campaign of 2003 6 to the sampling campaign of 2017 10 since the groundwater geochemistry of clusters c1 and c2 is controlled by the residual seawater refreshening the two clusters are combined to form the downgradient freshening zone 5 2 2 anthropogenic activities with elevated no3 concentrations fig 5 shows that the mean no3 concentrations of clusters c3 and c4 are significantly higher than the guideline value of 50 mg l given by the world health organization for drinking water the high no3 concentrations are attributed to anthropogenic sources such as fertilizer uses and human wastes based on isotope data yu et al 2020 concluded that fertilizer nitrogen and soil nitrogen were the dominant nitrate sources in the north part of vegetable cropping area and that soil nitrogen fertilizer nitrogen and manure and sewage nitrogen were the dominant nitrate sources in the south part of wheat cropping area see the boundary of the vegetable cropping area and the wheat cropping area in fig 2b fig 9 plots the molar ratio of no3 cl vs the cl concentration mmol l for the four clusters the molar ratio of no3 cl of seawater in the jiaozhou bay was calculated as 5 6 10 5 given that the no3 n and cl concentrations of seawater are 6 93 µmol l shen et al 2006 and 19 300 mg l liu et al 2019 respectively fig 9 shows that all the samples are above the no3 cl ratio line of seawater indicating other nitrate sources than the seawater the samples of clusters c1 and c2 with higher concentration of cl and lower molar ratios of no3 cl suggest the influence of municipal sewage and animal manure because groundwater impacted by sewage and animal mature usually contains high cl concentrations but relatively low no3 concentrations abu alnaeem et al 2018 the samples of clusters c3 and c4 with lower concentration of cl and higher molar ratio of no3 cl indicate the source of fertilizer nitrogen because groundwater impacted by agricultural fertilizer uses usually has high no3 concentrations but low cl concentrations ogrinc et al 2019 wang et al 2016 since the elevated no3 concentrations of clusters c3 and c4 are attributed to the agriculture fertilizer uses the wells of the two clusters are combined to form the upgradient fertilizer nitrogen zone 5 2 3 water rock interactions dominated by silicate weathering the pca results shown in fig s1 b indicate that ca2 and mg2 have relatively high scores in both pc1 and pc2 and this is attributed to water rock interactions in the aquifer we first examined to what extent the conservative mixing of seawater and rainwater can explain the ca2 and mg2 of the four clusters the conservative mixing lines of ca2 cl and mg2 cl were plotted in fig 10 a and 10 b respectively based on the two member mixing equation 5 c mix f sw c sw 1 f sw c rw where cmix is the mixed concentration of an ion i e ca2 mg2 or cl in groundwater f sw is the mixing fraction of seawater csw is the concentration of the ion in seawater and crw is the concentration of the ion in rainwater the ion concentrations of seawater in the jiaozhou bay were taken from liu et al 2019 since the ion concentrations of rainwater were unavailabe the lowest ion concentrations of each ion among the 327 groundwater samples were used fig 10 a and 10 b show that the ca2 and mg2 concentrations of almost all samples except several samples of cluster c1 are above the conventional mixing lines indicating additional sources of ca2 and mg2 cations such as the water rock interactions that produce ca2 and mg2 cations given that the quaternary aquifer sediments in the dagu river basin consists mainly of quartz feldspar calcite dolomite illite kaolinite and montmorillonite chen and zheng 2015 the elevated ca2 and mg2 concentrations can be explained by the weathering of silicate minerals such as ca montmorillonite and illite appelo and postma 2005 6 2h 3ca 0 33 si 7 33 al 0 67 al 4 o 20 oh 4 23 h 2 o 7 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 8 h 4 sio 4 ca 2 c a m o n t m o r i l l o n i t e k a o l i n i t e 7 k 0

that plots the molar ratio of ca2 na versus the molar ratio of mg2 na following gaillardet et al 1999 fig 10 c also plots the three areas with representative ca2 na and mg2 na molar ratios for carbonate silicate and evaporite minerals the figure shows that most of the samples of this study are located in the area of silicates indicating dominance of silicate weathering over the entire aquifer fig 10 d which was plotted in the same manner of fig 10 c but for the molar ratios of ca2 na and hco3 na indicates that weathering of calcite and dolomite minerals is not the source of elevated ca2 concentrations further examining the geochemistry data suggests that the evaluated ca2 and mg2 concentrations are not caused by carbonate or gypsum weathering for the two weathering processes the milligram equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 should be 1 1 this however is not the case at the study site as shown in fig s2 a of the supplementary information file the groundwater geochemistry data of this study do not support dissolution of calcite or dolomite for the following two reasons 1 the molar ratio of ca2 hco3 is not close to either 1 2 for calcite dissolution or 1 4 for dolomite dissolution as shown in fig s2 b and 2 the molar ratio of ca2 mg2 is not close to 1 1 for dolomite dissolution as shown in fig s2 c the groundwater geochemical data of this study do not support gypsum dissolution because the molar ratio of ca2 so4 2 is not close to 1 1 as shown in fig s2 d 6 discussion on temporal patterns and their controlling factors 6 1 temporal patterns identified by the two clustering methods table 2 of timestamp frequency shows two temporal changes of the cluster indices the first change is that for the data of the sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 almost all the wells belong to cluster c3 the period of the three sampling campaigns is called thereinafter the transition period of groundwater geochemistry comparing the relative frequency values before and after the transition period indicates that starting from the campaign of 2013 7 the relative frequency values of cluster c2 increase and the relative frequency values of clusters c3 and c4 decrease accordingly as a result the number of the timestamp clusters of bbac i co clustering was set to be three the bbac i co clustering results fig 7 are consistent with the hca one way clustering results in that the transition period stands out as timestamp cluster p2 in addition the sampling campaigns before 2011 9 were classified as timestamp cluster p1 except for 2009 4 which was classified to timestamp cluster p3 and the sampling campaigns after 2012 9 were classified as timestamp cluster p3 6 2 three geochemical periods and their controlling factors based on the results of hca one way clustering and bbac i co clustering we divided the 18 years of 2000 2017 into three periods as follows 1 the baseline period before the sampling campaign of 2011 4 2 the transition period for the three sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 and 3 the drought period after the sampling campaign of 2013 7 the temporal changes of groundwater geochemistry between the three periods are caused by the following two factors 1 ca2 and mg2 dilution and co2 introduction by the heavy precipitation in july 2011 that caused the change from the baseline period to the transition period and 2 ceased flow of the dagu river after 2013 due to drought and anthropogenic activities in the drought period 6 2 1 ca2 and mg2 dilution and co2 introduction by precipitation table 2 of the timestamp frequency indicates that during the transition period the sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 almost all groundwater samples belong to cluster c3 in other words the sample indices change from clusters c1 c2 and c4 to cluster c3 after the sampling campaign of 2011 9 fig 5 shows that the ca2 and mg2 concentrations of cluster c3 are lower than those of clusters c2 and c4 and that the hco3 concentrations of cluster c3 are higher than those of clusters c2 and c4 the two characteristics are attributed to the extreme drought condition from october 2010 to february 2011 followed by a heavy rainfall in july 2011 the total amount of precipitation was only 44 mm from october 2010 to february 2011 but 256 mm for july 2011 fig s3 considering precipitation is the major source of groundwater recharge to the unconfined aquifer the ca2 and mg2 concentrations may be diluted by the rainfall in july 2011 causing the decreased ca2 and mg2 concentrations in cluster c3 the increased hco3 concentrations in cluster c3 may be explained by the co2 introduced by the rainfall recharge based on the ph and hco3 concentrations in groundwater the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 in groundwater was calculated by using the geochemical computer code phreeqc with the default thermodynamic database of phreeqc dat apple and postma 2005 fig 11 a shows that the calculated pco2 values of groundwater are higher than the atmospheric pco2 value of 10 3 5 atm appelo and postma 2005 indicating additional sources of co2 from soils due to root respiration and decomposition of soil organic matter the pco2 values of the three sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 are generally higher than those of the other sampling campaigns indicating that the rainfall recharge introduced more co2 accumulated in the soils the ca2 and mg2 dilution and co2 introduction due to the precipitation in july 2011 are thus believed to be the reason that samples indices change from c1 c2 and c4 to c3 6 2 2 ceased river flow and anthropogenic activities in the drought period table 2 shows that after the transition period the sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 a number of samples of clusters c3 and c4 were classified to cluster c2 the change from c3 to c2 is illustrated in fig 11 b for well w14 that is located near the dagu river fig 2 this well belongs to cluster c3 for the sampling campaigns of 2004 9 2012 9 but belongs to cluster c2 after the sampling campaign of 2013 10 this change is attributed to the continuous drought conditions starting from 2010 in the dagu river basin fig 3 and especially to the ceased flow in the dagu river after september 2013 as shown in fig 11 b before the river flow ceased groundwater received river recharge and groundwater ca2 and mg2 concentrations near the river were low which is a characteristic of cluster c3 when the river flow ceased river recharge to groundwater stopped and the ca2 and mg2 concentrations increased which is a characteristic of cluster c2 the change of monitoring wells from cluster c4 to cluster c2 after 2013 10 is shown in fig s4 of the supplementary material file the change occurred for wells w1 w2 w5 w6 and w12 and the change is attributed to the increased so4 2 concentrations at these wells fig s4 the increased so4 2 concentrations may be caused by several reasons such as the uses of ammonium sulfate fertilizers and sewage inputs during the drought period 7 discussion on limitations of the two clustering methods the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering yield similar results with respect to the cluster memberships indicating that the location clusters and timestamp clusters given by the bbac i co clustering are reasonable in comparison with the hca one way clustering that relies on the location frequency table and the timestamp frequency table the bbac i co clustering is more efficient and easier to operate because theoretically speaking bbac i only requires the numbers of location clusters and the timestamp clusters after the numbers are determined bbac i can yield the location clusters and the timestamp clusters simultaneously in this sense the bbac i co clustering is more attractive than the hca one way clustering for understanding groundwater geochemistry in space and time although the similar results of the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering indicate that our empirical approaches are practical for handling the four issues of bbac i co clustering discussed in section 3 2 the empirical approaches are subject to three theoretical and practical limitations the first limitation is when removing monitoring wells and or sampling campaigns to meet the data completeness requirement of bbac i co clustering i e groundwater geochemical parameters are measured at every monitoring well and every sampling campaign certain location and timestamp clusters may be missed in this study cluster c1 was missed by the bbac i co clustering due to removing six wells the second limitation is that using only one principal component may result in loss of information regarding groundwater geochemistry this may be the reason that the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering yielded similar but different location clusters the third limitation is that the bbac i co clustering requires specifying the numbers of location and timestamp clusters a prior because the numbers are unknown in practice while the numbers can be determined by using the results of the hca one way clustering a better approach is needed so that the numbers can be determined independently within the bbac i co clustering this may be done by using optimization algorithms e g genetic algorithms and or statistical method e g the elbow method used in k means clustering to address the three limitations requires a theoretical study that however is beyond the scope of this study 8 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt of using the bbac i co clustering for understanding spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry there are four issues that are barriers to directly applying bbac i clustering to groundwater geochemical data and the four issues were addressed by four empirical approaches as follows 1 removing monitoring wells and or sampling campaigns where and when groundwater geochemical data are unavailable 2 applying pca to remaining data and using the first principal component scores for bbac i co clustering 3 applying the min max normalization to the scores so that all the data are positive for bbac i co clustering and 4 using the number of location and timestamp clusters determined from the hca one way clustering after applying the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering to the groundwater geochemical data collected from the dagu river basin we found that it is feasible to use the bbac i co clustering together with our empirical solutions for simultaneously identifying locations and timestamp clusters this study applies the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering to the 9 geochemical parameters ph ca2 mg2 nak cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and f of 327 groundwater samples collected from 19 monitoring wells over the period of 2000 2017 in the unconfined aquifer of dagu river basin the clustering analyses delineate two groundwater geochemical zones i e the downgradient residual seawater freshening zone and the upgradient fertilizer nitrogen zone there are three controlling factors of the two zones and they are residual seawater freshening in the downgradient zone elevated no3 concentrations due to anthropogenic activity in the entire aquifer and agricultural fertilizer uses in the upgradient zone and silicate weathering due to water rock interaction over the entire aquifer the clustering analyses yield three groundwater geochemical periods i e the baseline period before the sampling campaign of 2011 4 the transition period for the three sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 and the drought period after the sampling campaign of 2013 7 the temporal changes of groundwater geochemistry between the three periods were caused by the following two factors 1 ca2 and mg2 dilution and co2 introduction by the heavy precipitation in july 2011 that caused the change from the baseline period to the transition period and 2 ceased flow of the dagu river after 2013 due to drought and anthropogenic activities in the drought period the impacts of drought conditions and anthropogenic activities in the dagu river basin on groundwater geochemistry should be considered for managing groundwater resources of the basin credit authorship contribution statement honghua liu

3934,effectively and efficiently protecting groundwater resources requires a better understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry and their controlling factors natural and anthropogenic in this study to reveal the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry we explored two clustering methods i e the one way clustering implemented by using the hierarchical cluster analysis hca and the co clustering implemented by using the bregman block average co clustering algorithm with i divergence bbac i the one way clustering identifies the spatial and temporal patterns separately whereas the co clustering identifies the spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously the two clustering methods were applied to 9 geochemical parameters of 329 groundwater samples collected over the period of 2000 2017 from 19 monitoring wells located in the unconfined aquifer of the dagu river basin china as a first attempt of applying bbac i co clustering to groundwater geochemical data results show that it is feasible to use the bbac i co clustering method for simultaneously identifying location and timestamp clusters the clusters identified by the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering are similar based on the clustering results two geochemical zones and three geochemical periods of groundwater geochemistry were delineated the controlling factors of the two geochemical zones are residual seawater freshening elevated no3 concentrations and silicate weathering the temporal changes between the three geochemical periods are caused by a heavy rainfall in july 2011 after a one year drought and by ceased flow of the dagu river after 2013 due to drought conditions the impacts of drought conditions and anthropogenic activities in the dagu river basin on groundwater geochemistry should be considered for managing groundwater resources of the basin keywords dagu river basin residual seawater refreshening drought fertilizer nitrogen 1 introduction understanding spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry and their controlling factors natural and anthropogenic is imperative to protecting groundwater resources gaining such understanding demands a large amount of groundwater geochemistry data at the regional scale over a long period of groundwater monitoring in the last couple of decades long term monitoring data of groundwater geochemistry in regional aquifers have become available and statistical analysis has been performed to understand the spatio temporal patterns embedded in the data e g li et al 2021 jessen et al 2017 rakotondrabe et al 2018 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2021 wei et al 2021 yang et al 2021 a commonly used statistical method is cluster analysis that separates data into a number of clusters each of which has similar geochemical features so that insights on spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry can be gained by studying the clusters e g pacheco castro et al 2018 pant et al 2018 wu et al 2020a sayemuzzaman et al 2018 yang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the clusters can be categorized into two kinds i e location clusters and timestamp clusters the location clusters indicate which monitoring wells can be classified into one cluster and thus reveal spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry the timestamp clusters indicate which sampling campaigns can be classified into one cluster and thus reveal temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry obtaining the location and timestamp clusters is necessary for advancing our understanding of spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry this study explores the one way clustering and co clustering methods for cluster analysis of groundwater geochemistry the one way clustering produces the location and timestamp clusters separately whereas the co clustering produces the location and timestamp clusters simultaneously detailed differences between the two methods are elaborated by using fig 1 as shown in fig 1 a the groundwater geochemical data are generally three dimensional because multiple geochemical parameters are measured for groundwater samples collected from multiple monitoring wells at multiple sampling campaigns for conducting a statistical analysis the three dimensional dataset is always converted into a two dimensional dataset shown in fig 1 b the rows of the dataset are monitoring wells at different sampling campaigns and the columns are the geochemical parameters the one way clustering uses various clustering methods e g hierarchical cluster analysis hca or k means to determine the number of clusters and the cluster memberships i e well w at sampling campaign t belonging to cluster c as shown in fig 1 c based on the cluster index the final products of the one way clustering are the location frequency table shown in fig 1 d and the timestamp frequency table shown in fig 1 e the location frequency table lists the number of groundwater samples belonging to each cluster for each well over all sampling campaigns and this table can be used to understand spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry e g delineating groundwater geochemical zones the timestamp frequency table lists the number of groundwater samples belong to each cluster for each sampling campaign over all monitoring wells and this table can be used to understand temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry e g identifying a transition period of groundwater geochemistry due to natural and or anthropogenic reasons the one way clustering is a traditional approach for analyzing groundwater geochemical data for example hca has been commonly used to partition sampling locations into location clusters e g de brito neto et al 2016 wu et al 2020a sayemuzzaman et al 2018 pant et al 2018 however there are only few studies that used hca to partition sampling campaigns into timestamp clusters e g yu et al 2017 yang et al 2020 a potential problem of the one way clustering is that the spatial and temporal patterns are identified separately whereas groundwater geochemistry evolves in space and time simultaneously different from the one way clustering that produces the location and timestamp clusters separately the co clustering produces the location and timestamp clusters simultaneously as shown in fig 1 h this is achieved by iteratively assigning monitoring wells to the location clusters and the sampling campaigns to the timestamp clusters and the final clusters are obtained by minimizing a distortion function defined to measure the difference between the data before and after performing the co clustering there are multiple distortion functions and a review of the functions is referred to banerjee et al 2007 this study used the bregman block average co clustering method with the i divergence bbac i developed by dhillon et al 2003 bbac i uses the i divergence also known as kullback leibler divergence due to its superiority as demonstrated by banerjee et al 2007 bbac i has been used for environmental studies recently wu et al 2015 applied bbac i to daily temperature data collected at 28 weather stations in dutch from 1992 to 2011 to understand the spatio temporal patterns of temperature wu et al 2016 applied bbac i to a long term time series of first leaf dates over europe from 1950 to 2011 to study spatio temporal patterns in spring phenology wu et al 2020b further used bbac i to explore the spatial patterns of first bloom date in china and their temporal dynamics for 40 years from 1979 to 2018 python codes for general purpose co clustering were recently developed by role et al 2019 bbac i has not been applied to groundwater geochemical data and this study is the first attempt of using bbac i for co clustering to understand spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry this study aims to answer the following two questions 1 can bbac i be applied to a three dimensional dataset of groundwater geochemistry for understanding spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry 2 what are the advantages and disadvantages of the co clustering in comparison with the one way clustering with respect to understanding spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry the two questions are tackled by applying the two clustering methods to the groundwater geochemistry data collected from the unconfined aquifer of the dagu river basin china fig 2 groundwater of this aquifer accounts for about 70 of freshwater resources in the basin and provides 30 70 of water supply for drinking water and agriculture and industrial uses qingdao water resources bureau 2019 recent studies fang et al 2020 liu et al 2017 yu et al 2020 yin et al 2021 have shown that groundwater quality of this aquifer has deteriorated over time due to overexploitation xiong et al 2020 seawater intrusion chen and zheng 2015 liu et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 anthropogenic contaminants e g fertilizer nitrogen this study differs from the previous studies on the following two aspects 1 we use both hca one way clustering and bbac i co clustering methods for understanding spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry which has not been attempted for the dagu river basin and 2 the groundwater geochemical data used in this study include 327 groundwater samples collected from 19 monitoring wells over a long monitoring period of 18 years the number of samples is significantly larger than those used in previous studies the clustering analysis of this study advances our understanding on the spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry and the controlling factors of the patterns in the unconfined aquifer and the findings of this study are expected to be useful for effective and efficient management of groundwater resources in the aquifer 2 study area and groundwater geochemical data 2 1 study area the dagu river basin is located in the shangdong province china fig 2 a and the dagu river flows into the jiaozhou bay fig 2 c this area is under a temperate continental climate with hot rainy summers and cold dry winters the annual average temperature rainfall and evaporation are 12 c 692 mm and 960 mm respectively the annual precipitation ranges from 407 mm to 1 353 mm and nearly 45 of the annual precipitation occurs in july and august daily temperature and precipitation data over the period of 1990 2015 are available at the qingdao meteorological station managed by the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn accessed as of 5 10 2021 as shown in fig 2 b the land use types of this area are characterized by croplands dominated by vegetable cropping in the north part and wheat cropping in the south part of the basin yu et al 2020 the unconfined aquifer in the dagu river basin has a quaternary alluvial proluvial double layer structure xiong et al 2020 the upper layer is 2 4 m thick and composed of clayey sand and sandy clay with low permeability the lower layer is 4 8 m thick and composed of sand and gravel with high permeability zhang et al 2020 groundwater in the aquifer is mainly stored in the lower layer beneath the lower layer is impermeable cretaceous siltstones and clay rocks fang et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 c the regional groundwater flow direction in the unconfined aquifer is from north to south following the land surface topography the main source of groundwater recharge to the unconfined aquifer is precipitation accounting for 65 of the total recharge followed by river recharge 25 and irrigation 10 qingdao water resources bureau 2019 the river recharge of groundwater from the river occurs only during monsoon seasons from july to september in the wet years as the river is non perennial for the aquifer s discharge 90 of it is water exploitation for drinking agricultural and industrial uses wen et al 2017 because the unconfined aquifer is recharged by precipitation directly temporal variation of the aquifer s water level is largely controlled by temporal variation of precipitation and this is illustrated in fig 3 this figure plots the groundwater level measured every five days at wells w9 and w15 see the well locations in fig 2 c and the daily precipitation measured at the qingdao meteorological station see its location in fig 2 c the temporal variation of groundwater levels in general matches that of precipitation for instance the continuous decline of groundwater level after 2010 corresponds to the negative 12 month standardized precipitation index spi 12 mckee et al 1993 after 2010 whichwas calculated based on the precipitation data to characterize meteorological droughts the interaction between groundwater and precipitation is important to the temporal evolution of groundwater geochemistry in the unconfined aquifer previous studies have revealed a number of factors that control spatial temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry of the unconfined aquifer one controlling factor of the spatial patterns is the seawater intrusion that occurred 1990 s in 1998 a 4 km long underground cutoff wall was built at the location of the red line shown in fig 2 c downstream of the dagu river xiong et al 2020 found that while groundwater south to the cutoff wall is still seriously affected by seawater intrusion groundwater north to the cutoff wall is not indicating that the cutoff wall effectively stopped seawater intrusion another controlling factor of the spatial patterns is nitrogen pollution from multiple sources fang et al 2020 found that the nitrogen source in the central and northern regions of the basin is fertilizer nitrogen based on an isotope study yu et al 2020 found that in the south region of the basin nitrogen is also from soil manure and sewage with respect to the spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry yin et al 2021 divided the dagu river basin into three spatial zones i e the upper middle and lower reaches and the monitoring period of 2001 2017 into three stages i e stage i from 2001 to 2006 stage ii from 2007 to 2012 and stage iii from 2013 to 2017 the three spatial zones and three temporal stages of yin et al 2021 based on their best professional judgement are different from the two geochemical zones and three geochemical periods of this study based on the hca one way clustering and bbac i co clustering methods yin et al 2021 found that mineral dissolution precipitation cation exchange and human inputs e g nitrogen fertilizer livestock manure and sewage from industrial and domestic sources are the controlling factors of the spatio temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry in the basin these previous studies provide the basis of geochemical analysis for evaluating and understanding the clustering results of this study it should be noted that the geochemical analysis of this study was conducted for each geochemical zone and each geochemical period the controlling factors of the two geochemical zones are residual seawater freshening elevated no3 concentrations and silicate weathering the temporal changes between the three geochemical periods are caused by a heavy rainfall in july 2011 after a one year drought and by ceased flow of the dagu river after 2013 due to drought conditions these findings are complementary to those of previous studies and provide an in depth understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution of groundwater geochemistry in the dagu river basin 2 2 groundwater geochemical data during 2000 2017 a total of 378 groundwater samples were collected from 19 monitoring wells screened at the unconfined aquifer the well locations are shown in fig 2 c the sampling months and years are listed in table s1 in the supplementary information file thirteengroundwater geochemical parameters were measured and they are alkalinity total hardness total dissolved solids tds ph ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and f alkalinity total hardness and tds were excluded from the clustering for this study because the three parameters can be derived or approximated from the other 10 parameters appelo and postma 2005 the remaining 10 parameters including major cations and anions are commonly used for characterizing groundwater geochemistry among the 378 groundwater samples 43 samples did not have measurements of hco3 no3 andf see table s1 and were thus excluded from further analysis for the remaining 335samples 136samples have thesum of na and k concentrations not their individual concentrations in order to maximize the data use the sumof na and k concentrations denoted as nak hereinafter was used in the cluster analysis for all the 335 samples among the 335 samples 199 samples have separated na and k concentrations and the averageconcentrations of na and k are 146 9 mg l and 14 1 mg l respectively the large difference may indicate certain disadvantage of using the sum of na and k concentrations the charge balance errorwas calculated for the 199 samples with separated na and k concentrations following previous studies e g ghesquière et al 2015 yang et al 2020 eightsamples see table s1 with charge balance error higher than 10 were excluded from the clustering as a result the dataset used for the cluster analysis includes 327 groundwater samples with 9 geochemical parameters i e ph ca2 mg2 nak cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and f 3 methodology this section introduces the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering methods although graphical methods such as stiff diagram stiff 1951 hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d giménez forcada 2010 2019 and gaillardet diagram gaillardet et al 1999 were also used in this study for understanding the groundwater geochemistry details of these methods are not given in this paper but referred to the references above the hca analysis was performed by using python libraries scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 and scipy jones et al 2001 the bbac i co clustering analysis was performed by using the clustering geo data cubes package nattino et al 2019 the python codes and groundwater geochemical data used in this study are available on github at https github com jyangfsu clustering dagu 3 1 hca one way clustering method hca with the ward method is an agglomerative approach to separate data into clusters hca starts by treating each sample as a cluster and then merges the clusters stepwise to generate larger clusters at each step of merging two clusters are merged into one according to the ward criterion with the smallest increase of sum of squared errors the merging procedure continues until only one cluster remains to contain all samples this produces a dendrogram that presents the linkage distance between merged clusters the number of clusters and associated cluster membership of data i e which sample belonging to which cluster are commonly determined by placing a so called phenon line at a linkage distance since hca has been well documented in statistical books such as rencher 2003 we do not present more details of the method but focus on the hca based one way cluster analysis for the groundwater geochemistry data of this study following yang et al 2020 the 327 groundwater samples with 9 parameters were organized into a data matrix with 327 rows and 9 columns as shown in fig 1 b the natural log transformation and z score standardization which are typical for geochemical data clustering templ et al 2008 were applied to the data applying hca to the data yields the cluster index as shown in fig 1 c the clustering results were validated by using the principal component analysis pca to project the high dimensional geochemical data into low dimensional typically two dimensional maps pacheco castro et al 2018 yang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 if the number of the clusters and the cluster membership are appropriate the low dimensional maps show clear separation between the clusters based on the hca produced cluster index for the groundwater samples the location frequency table fig 1 d and the timestamp frequency table fig 1 e were generated to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry table 1 is the location frequency table used in this study and it was generated by counting the number of samples that fall into each cluster for each well studying the spatial distribution of the clusters can reveal spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry if the groundwater geochemistry is stable over time all the samples from one well would belong to one cluster this however is not the case as shown in table 1 because groundwater geochemistry changes over time and samples from one well may belong to more than one cluster the timestamp frequency table for sampling campaigns is thus needed for understanding the temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry table 2 is the timestamp frequency table used in this study and it was produced by counting the number of wells belonging to each cluster for each sampling campaign over all monitoring wells tracking the temporal changes of the frequency can reveal temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry 3 2 bbac i co clustering method the bbac i co clustering method can be applied to a two dimensional data matrix with positive element values since this method has not been applied to geochemical studies we below briefly describe this method for matrix o s t of data collected in space and time with the size of m n for m monitoring wells s and n sampling campaigns t bbac i uses an optimization process to convert the original data matrix o s t to a co clustered data matrix o s t where s and t denote the clustered location sets and timestamp sets respectively the size of o s t is k l where k is the number of location clusters and l is the number of timestamp clusters bbac i first randomly assigns the monitoring wells to the location clusters and the sampling campaigns to the timestamp clusters matrix r of size m k is used to denote the location cluster membership if the i th i 1 2 m monitoring well belongs to the j th j 1 2 k location cluster the corresponding element value in matrix r is set as one all other elements of matrix r are set as zeros see fig 1 h for example similarly a binary matrix denoted as c of size n l is used to denote the timestamp cluster membership based on matrices r c and o the co clustered data matrix o s t is constructed as nattino et al 2019 1 o s t r t o s t c r t ec where operator is the hadamard division i e the element wise division between two matrices e is the identity matrix that has the same size of o s t and the superscript t of r t denotes the matrix transpose the elements in the co clustered data matrix o s t are cluster based means matrix o s t is further used to construct matrix a s t as 2 a s t r o s t c t the loss in mutual information before and after the co clustering is measured by using the i divergence d i between matrices o s t and a s t defined as wu et al 2015 3 d i o s t a s t s 1 k t 1 l s s t t o s t log o s t a s t where o s t and a s t are elements of o s t and a s t respectively d i is minimized by iteratively adjusting the cluster memberships in matrices of r and c for the monitoring wells and sampling campaigns banerjee et al 2007 showed that d i can monotonically decrease and converge to a local minimum details of minimizing d i can be found in wu et al 2015 the final results of bbac i are matrix r of size m k for the location cluster membership m monitoring wells for k clusters and matrix c of size n l for the timestamp cluster membership n sampling campaigns for l clusters fig 1 h bbac i cannot be directly applied to the groundwater geochemistry data for co clustering due to four issues we first describe the four issues and then offer our empirical solutions to the issues the first issue is that the data matrix o s t cannot have any empty elements for the sake of estimating the loss in mutual information defined in equation 3 this requirement is not always satisfied for groundwater geochemical data because certain wells may not be sampled over certain sampling campaigns as shown in table s1 to resolve this issue we suggest removing such a well and a campaign from the data matrix for co clustering the second issue is that bbac i can only be used for co clustering a two dimensional data matrix but not a three dimensional matrix such as that discussed above for a number of geochemical parameters of groundwater samples collected from multiple wells over multiple sampling campaigns to resolve this issue we suggest first organizing the three dimensional matrix as the two dimensional matrix as shown in fig 1 b and then applying pca to the two dimensional data as shown in fig 1 f the third issue is that bbac i requires that all the elements of o s t are positive for the sake of evaluating the loss of mutual information defined in equation 3 but certain pc1 scores may be negative to resolve this issue we suggest applying the min max normalization y y min y max y min ε to convert negative pc1 scores into positive values where y represents the original pc1 scores y min and y max denote the minimum and maximum values of pc1 scores respectively and ε denotes a small value 10 8 in this study used for all samples to ensure that all values are positive the last issue is that the numbers of location and timestamp clusters i e k and l need to be specified for bbac i a priori but these numbers are unknown for real world problems our solution in this study is to use the numbers determined by the hca one way clustering which are reliable and physically reasonable as discussed below it should be noted that the solutions provided above are empirical and evaluating their potential impacts on bbac i is warranted in a future study 4 results 4 1 hca one way classification fig 4 shows the dendrogram of the hca classification for the 327 groundwater samples the phenon line drawn at the linkage distance of 20 led to four clusters denoted as c1 c4 to examine geochemical dissimilarity of the four clusters the stiff diagrams of the four clusters are plotted in fig 4 by using mean concentrations of eight geochemical parameters of the clusters cluster c1 has a distinctive shape with elevated mean concentrations of na k and cl the mean concentration of no3 of cluster c1 is significantly smaller than those of the other three clusters the stiff diagram of cluster c3 are different from those of clusters c2 and c4 in that cluster c3 s mean concentrations of ca2 and hco3 are larger than the mean concentrations of other cations and anions the stiff diagrams of clusters c2 and c4 have a similar shape except that the mean concentrations of cluster c2 are larger than those of cluster c4 fig 5 plots the boxplots of all the nine groundwater geochemical parameters to better understand the geochemical characteristics of the four clusters cluster c1 is characterized by high mean ph and high mean concentrations of nak cl so4 2 and hco3 but low mean concentrations of ca2 and no3 cluster c2 is characterized by the highest mean concentrations of ca2 and the second highest mean concentrations of so4 2 and mg2 among the four clusters cluster c3 is characterized by relatively lowest mean concentrations of ca2 and mg2 but relatively high mean concentration of hco3 cluster c4 is characterized by low mean concentrations of all the parameters except ca2 mg2 and no3 the boxplots qualitatively support the classification of the four clusters fig 6 shows the pca visualization performed to further examine whether the classification of the four clusters is reasonable for the pca analysis based on the kaiser criterion kaiser 1960 the first two principal components pcs with eigenvalues greater than one were selected as shown in fig s1 a of the supplementary information file the first principal component pc1 explains 33 of the total variance and the second principal component pc2 explains 21 of the total variance based on the first two pc scores fig 6 shows that the four clusters are reasonably separated with a marginal overlap indicating that the cluster classification is reasonable with respect to grouping the groundwater geochemical measurements 4 2 two frequency tables based on the hca clustering results the location frequency table table 1 and timestamp frequency table table 2 were generated to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of the groundwater geochemistry respectively table 1 lists the number of groundwater samples and the corresponding relative frequency of each cluster for the individual wells taking well w1 as an example ten samples were collected from this well over the 18 year monitoring period for the ten samples four and six samples belong to clusters c2 and c4 respectively and the corresponding relative frequency values are 4 10 40 and 6 10 60 a larger frequency indicates more stable groundwater geochemistry and a value of 100 means that the groundwater geochemistry does not change over time of the 19 wells only three wells w9 w16 and w19 have a relative frequency larger than 80 indicating that the groundwater geochemistry of the unconfined aquifer changes dramatically over time due to the controlling factors discussed in sections 5 and 6 table 2 lists the number of samples in each cluster for the individual sampling campaigns and the relative frequencies of the four clusters are also listed taking the sampling campaign of 2001 6 june 2001 and this notation is used throughout the paper as an example among the seven groundwater samples collected from seven monitoring wells one sample belongs to cluster c1 three samples to cluster c2 and three samples to cluster c4 the corresponding relative frequencies are 14 1 7 43 3 7 and 43 3 7 if the total number of samples is less than five for a sampling campaign the relative frequency was not calculated for each sampling campaign the relative frequency changes between clusters indicating spatial variability of groundwater geochemistry the sampling campaign of 2012 9 is an extreme case that all samples belong to cluster c3 the relative frequency also changes between sampling campaigns indicating that it is necessary to study the joint variation of groundwater geochemistry in space and time 4 3 bbac i co clustering results to apply the bbac i co clustering to the groundwater geochemical data of dagu river basin six wells w1 w12 w16 w17 w18 and w19 were excluded because a lot of samples were not collected for these wells table s1 sampling campaigns of 2000 9 and 2001 6 were also excluded because only 1 and 7 samples were collected respectively in the two sampling campaigns for the campaign of 2005 4 although groundwater samples were not collected from wells w7 w8 and w10 this sampling campaign was retained so that the data of this sampling campaign can be utilized in bbac i co clustering for the three wells the average concentrations based on those of campaigns of 2004 9 and 2006 9 were used for the campaign of 2005 4 similarly since groundwater samples were not collected from wells w13 and w14 during the sampling campaign of 2013 7 the average concentrations based on those of 2012 9 and 2013 10 were used for the two wells the remaining 299 groundwater samples collected from 13 monitoring wells during 23 sampling campaigns were used for bbac i co clustering organizing the data of 9 geochemical parameters in the manner shown in fig 1 a led to a three dimensional matrix with the size of 13 23 9 the natural log transformation and z score standardization were also applied to the data then pca was the applied to the data to extract the first principal component scores pc1 scores for the pca results of this study pc1 pc4 explain 25 20 13 and 11 of data variation the first principal component scores pc1 scores were used to represent the maximum possible information of the original groundwater geochemical data and the pc1 score was organized as the two dimensional matrix shown in fig 1 g the two dimensional data was used as o s t for bbac i co clustering the size of o s t is 13 23 corresponding to the selected 13 monitoring wells and 23 sampling campaigns for the bbac i co clustering the number of location clusters and the number of timestamp clusters were both set as three based on the location frequency table table 1 and the timestamp frequency table table 2 and the reasons are given in sections 5 and 6 the co clustering results are shown in fig 7 using a heatmap as a matrix in the manner of fig 1 h the three location clusters were denoted as l1 l2 and l3 and the three timestamp clusters were denoted as p1 p2 and p3 location cluster l1 contains wells w2 w5 w6 w10 and w15 l2 contains wells w3 w4 w7 w8 w9 w11 and w13 and l3 only contains well w14 for the three timestamp clusters timestamp cluster p1 includes all the sampling campaigns of 2002 9 2011 4 except the campaign of 2009 4 this campaign belongs to timestamp cluster p3 and p3 includes all the sampling campaigns of 2013 7 2017 10 timestamp cluster p2 includes there consecutive sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 5 discussion on spatial patterns and their controlling factors 5 1 spatial patterns identified by the two clustering methods examining table 1 of location frequency and fig 2 c of well locations reveals the following spatial pattens 1 the samples of cluster c1 are mainly from wells w17 and w19 located north to the cutoff wall 2 the samples of cluster c2 are mainly from wells w5 w6 w14 w15 w16 and w18 and the latter four wells are located north to the wells of cluster c1 3 the samples of cluster c3 are mainly from wells w13 and w14 located north to the wells of cluster c2 and 4 the samples of cluster c4 are mainly from wells w1 w12 located north to the wells of cluster c3 therefore the overall spatial pattern is that the wells of clusters c1 c4 are located from south to north along the direction from the downgradient to the upgradient of groundwater flow in the study area for the wells of cluster c1 c4 because wells w17 and w19 of cluster c1 were excluded from the co clustering analysis as explained in section 3 2 the number of the location clusters used for the bbac i co clustering was thus set as three rather than four fig 7 shows that the three location clusters l1 l3 produced by bbac i co clustering are generally consistent with the three clusters c2 c4 produced by the hca one way clustering generally speaking location cluster l1 corresponds to cluster c2 location cluster l2 to cluster c4 and location cluster l3 to cluster c3 however discrepancy between the wells of l1 l3 and the wells of c2 c4 is noticed for example wells w13 and w14 belong to cluster c3 of the hca one way clustering but according to the bbac i co clustering w13 and w14 belongs to clusters l2 and l3 respectively the discrepancy is not surprising because the bbac i co clustering used less data than the hca one way clustering did as explained in section 3 2 in addition only the pc1 scores were used for bbac i co clustering and certain information of the groundwater geochemistry in other pcs may lose more discussion on these issues is given in section 7 5 2 two geochemical zones and their controlling factors based on the results of hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering the unconfined aquifer of the dagu river basin was divided into the following two geochemical zones the downgradient residual seawater freshening zone that consists of the wells of clusters c1 and c2 and the upgradient fertilizer nitrogen zone that consists of wells of clusters c3 and c4 the estimated boundary of the two zones is shown in fig 2 c there are three controlling factors of the two groundwater geochemical zones and they are residual seawater freshening in the downgradient zone elevated no3 concentrations due to anthropogenic activity in the entire aquifer and agricultural fertilizer uses in the upgradient zone and silicate weathering due to water rock interaction over the entire aquifer 5 2 1 residual seawater freshening the residual seawater is referred to the seawater that entered the aquifer before the cutoff wall was built in 1998 and the high concentrations of nak and cl at wells w17 and w19 of cluster c1 are attributed to the residual seawater the residual seawater is being continuously freshened by groundwater that flows from north to south fig 2 c to understand the residual seawater refreshening the hfe d gimenez forcada 2010 was used to identify different hydrochemical facies produced during the stages of seawater intrusion and freshening fig 8 the diagram considers the percentage values of the four most significant ions i e ca2 or mg2 na k cl and so4 2 or hco3 co3 2 considering that na and cl are the dominant ions in seawater and that ca2 and hco3 are typically dominant ions in fresh water fig 8 shows the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram used in this study with a total of 16 hydrochemical facies e g na cl for seawater and ca hco3 so4 for fresh groundwater the conservative mixing line between fresh groundwater and seawater was generated by using the concentrations of the two end members the concentrations of seawater in jiaozhou bay were taken from liu et al 2019 since concentrations of fresh groundwater are not available we followed giménez forcada 2010 2019 to use the highest percentages of ca2 or mg2 and hco3 or so4 2 the diagram shows the intrusion process in which the groundwater type evolves from ca hco3 so4 face 13 to ca cl face 16 and ultimately to na cl face 4 the freshening process shown in the diagram is opposite and the groundwater type evolves from na cl face 4 to na hco3 face 1 and ultimately to ca hco3 so4 face 13 the 191 groundwater samples with separated na and k concentrations were plotted in fig 8 to illustrate the refreshening process of the residual seawater generally speaking the samples of clusters c1 and c2 are distributed along the direction of freshening since the samples of the two clusters are mainly from wells w14 w19 located at the south end of the dagu river basin fig 2c it is likely that the residual seawater is freshened by the regional groundwater flowing from north to south this is evidenced by the groundwater geochemistry evolution from the na cl type to the ca hco3 so4 type along the dashed blue line shown in fig 8 that connects wells w19 w17 w16 w15 and w14 located from south to north in the downgradient area of the aquifer the freshening process is continuous as evidenced by the red solid line shown in fig 8 that connects the groundwater geochemical data at well w19 from the sampling campaign of 2003 6 to the sampling campaign of 2017 10 since the groundwater geochemistry of clusters c1 and c2 is controlled by the residual seawater refreshening the two clusters are combined to form the downgradient freshening zone 5 2 2 anthropogenic activities with elevated no3 concentrations fig 5 shows that the mean no3 concentrations of clusters c3 and c4 are significantly higher than the guideline value of 50 mg l given by the world health organization for drinking water the high no3 concentrations are attributed to anthropogenic sources such as fertilizer uses and human wastes based on isotope data yu et al 2020 concluded that fertilizer nitrogen and soil nitrogen were the dominant nitrate sources in the north part of vegetable cropping area and that soil nitrogen fertilizer nitrogen and manure and sewage nitrogen were the dominant nitrate sources in the south part of wheat cropping area see the boundary of the vegetable cropping area and the wheat cropping area in fig 2b fig 9 plots the molar ratio of no3 cl vs the cl concentration mmol l for the four clusters the molar ratio of no3 cl of seawater in the jiaozhou bay was calculated as 5 6 10 5 given that the no3 n and cl concentrations of seawater are 6 93 µmol l shen et al 2006 and 19 300 mg l liu et al 2019 respectively fig 9 shows that all the samples are above the no3 cl ratio line of seawater indicating other nitrate sources than the seawater the samples of clusters c1 and c2 with higher concentration of cl and lower molar ratios of no3 cl suggest the influence of municipal sewage and animal manure because groundwater impacted by sewage and animal mature usually contains high cl concentrations but relatively low no3 concentrations abu alnaeem et al 2018 the samples of clusters c3 and c4 with lower concentration of cl and higher molar ratio of no3 cl indicate the source of fertilizer nitrogen because groundwater impacted by agricultural fertilizer uses usually has high no3 concentrations but low cl concentrations ogrinc et al 2019 wang et al 2016 since the elevated no3 concentrations of clusters c3 and c4 are attributed to the agriculture fertilizer uses the wells of the two clusters are combined to form the upgradient fertilizer nitrogen zone 5 2 3 water rock interactions dominated by silicate weathering the pca results shown in fig s1 b indicate that ca2 and mg2 have relatively high scores in both pc1 and pc2 and this is attributed to water rock interactions in the aquifer we first examined to what extent the conservative mixing of seawater and rainwater can explain the ca2 and mg2 of the four clusters the conservative mixing lines of ca2 cl and mg2 cl were plotted in fig 10 a and 10 b respectively based on the two member mixing equation 5 c mix f sw c sw 1 f sw c rw where cmix is the mixed concentration of an ion i e ca2 mg2 or cl in groundwater f sw is the mixing fraction of seawater csw is the concentration of the ion in seawater and crw is the concentration of the ion in rainwater the ion concentrations of seawater in the jiaozhou bay were taken from liu et al 2019 since the ion concentrations of rainwater were unavailabe the lowest ion concentrations of each ion among the 327 groundwater samples were used fig 10 a and 10 b show that the ca2 and mg2 concentrations of almost all samples except several samples of cluster c1 are above the conventional mixing lines indicating additional sources of ca2 and mg2 cations such as the water rock interactions that produce ca2 and mg2 cations given that the quaternary aquifer sediments in the dagu river basin consists mainly of quartz feldspar calcite dolomite illite kaolinite and montmorillonite chen and zheng 2015 the elevated ca2 and mg2 concentrations can be explained by the weathering of silicate minerals such as ca montmorillonite and illite appelo and postma 2005 6 2h 3ca 0 33 si 7 33 al 0 67 al 4 o 20 oh 4 23 h 2 o 7 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 8 h 4 sio 4 ca 2 c a m o n t m o r i l l o n i t e k a o l i n i t e 7 k 0

that plots the molar ratio of ca2 na versus the molar ratio of mg2 na following gaillardet et al 1999 fig 10 c also plots the three areas with representative ca2 na and mg2 na molar ratios for carbonate silicate and evaporite minerals the figure shows that most of the samples of this study are located in the area of silicates indicating dominance of silicate weathering over the entire aquifer fig 10 d which was plotted in the same manner of fig 10 c but for the molar ratios of ca2 na and hco3 na indicates that weathering of calcite and dolomite minerals is not the source of elevated ca2 concentrations further examining the geochemistry data suggests that the evaluated ca2 and mg2 concentrations are not caused by carbonate or gypsum weathering for the two weathering processes the milligram equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 should be 1 1 this however is not the case at the study site as shown in fig s2 a of the supplementary information file the groundwater geochemistry data of this study do not support dissolution of calcite or dolomite for the following two reasons 1 the molar ratio of ca2 hco3 is not close to either 1 2 for calcite dissolution or 1 4 for dolomite dissolution as shown in fig s2 b and 2 the molar ratio of ca2 mg2 is not close to 1 1 for dolomite dissolution as shown in fig s2 c the groundwater geochemical data of this study do not support gypsum dissolution because the molar ratio of ca2 so4 2 is not close to 1 1 as shown in fig s2 d 6 discussion on temporal patterns and their controlling factors 6 1 temporal patterns identified by the two clustering methods table 2 of timestamp frequency shows two temporal changes of the cluster indices the first change is that for the data of the sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 almost all the wells belong to cluster c3 the period of the three sampling campaigns is called thereinafter the transition period of groundwater geochemistry comparing the relative frequency values before and after the transition period indicates that starting from the campaign of 2013 7 the relative frequency values of cluster c2 increase and the relative frequency values of clusters c3 and c4 decrease accordingly as a result the number of the timestamp clusters of bbac i co clustering was set to be three the bbac i co clustering results fig 7 are consistent with the hca one way clustering results in that the transition period stands out as timestamp cluster p2 in addition the sampling campaigns before 2011 9 were classified as timestamp cluster p1 except for 2009 4 which was classified to timestamp cluster p3 and the sampling campaigns after 2012 9 were classified as timestamp cluster p3 6 2 three geochemical periods and their controlling factors based on the results of hca one way clustering and bbac i co clustering we divided the 18 years of 2000 2017 into three periods as follows 1 the baseline period before the sampling campaign of 2011 4 2 the transition period for the three sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 and 3 the drought period after the sampling campaign of 2013 7 the temporal changes of groundwater geochemistry between the three periods are caused by the following two factors 1 ca2 and mg2 dilution and co2 introduction by the heavy precipitation in july 2011 that caused the change from the baseline period to the transition period and 2 ceased flow of the dagu river after 2013 due to drought and anthropogenic activities in the drought period 6 2 1 ca2 and mg2 dilution and co2 introduction by precipitation table 2 of the timestamp frequency indicates that during the transition period the sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 almost all groundwater samples belong to cluster c3 in other words the sample indices change from clusters c1 c2 and c4 to cluster c3 after the sampling campaign of 2011 9 fig 5 shows that the ca2 and mg2 concentrations of cluster c3 are lower than those of clusters c2 and c4 and that the hco3 concentrations of cluster c3 are higher than those of clusters c2 and c4 the two characteristics are attributed to the extreme drought condition from october 2010 to february 2011 followed by a heavy rainfall in july 2011 the total amount of precipitation was only 44 mm from october 2010 to february 2011 but 256 mm for july 2011 fig s3 considering precipitation is the major source of groundwater recharge to the unconfined aquifer the ca2 and mg2 concentrations may be diluted by the rainfall in july 2011 causing the decreased ca2 and mg2 concentrations in cluster c3 the increased hco3 concentrations in cluster c3 may be explained by the co2 introduced by the rainfall recharge based on the ph and hco3 concentrations in groundwater the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 in groundwater was calculated by using the geochemical computer code phreeqc with the default thermodynamic database of phreeqc dat apple and postma 2005 fig 11 a shows that the calculated pco2 values of groundwater are higher than the atmospheric pco2 value of 10 3 5 atm appelo and postma 2005 indicating additional sources of co2 from soils due to root respiration and decomposition of soil organic matter the pco2 values of the three sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 are generally higher than those of the other sampling campaigns indicating that the rainfall recharge introduced more co2 accumulated in the soils the ca2 and mg2 dilution and co2 introduction due to the precipitation in july 2011 are thus believed to be the reason that samples indices change from c1 c2 and c4 to c3 6 2 2 ceased river flow and anthropogenic activities in the drought period table 2 shows that after the transition period the sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 a number of samples of clusters c3 and c4 were classified to cluster c2 the change from c3 to c2 is illustrated in fig 11 b for well w14 that is located near the dagu river fig 2 this well belongs to cluster c3 for the sampling campaigns of 2004 9 2012 9 but belongs to cluster c2 after the sampling campaign of 2013 10 this change is attributed to the continuous drought conditions starting from 2010 in the dagu river basin fig 3 and especially to the ceased flow in the dagu river after september 2013 as shown in fig 11 b before the river flow ceased groundwater received river recharge and groundwater ca2 and mg2 concentrations near the river were low which is a characteristic of cluster c3 when the river flow ceased river recharge to groundwater stopped and the ca2 and mg2 concentrations increased which is a characteristic of cluster c2 the change of monitoring wells from cluster c4 to cluster c2 after 2013 10 is shown in fig s4 of the supplementary material file the change occurred for wells w1 w2 w5 w6 and w12 and the change is attributed to the increased so4 2 concentrations at these wells fig s4 the increased so4 2 concentrations may be caused by several reasons such as the uses of ammonium sulfate fertilizers and sewage inputs during the drought period 7 discussion on limitations of the two clustering methods the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering yield similar results with respect to the cluster memberships indicating that the location clusters and timestamp clusters given by the bbac i co clustering are reasonable in comparison with the hca one way clustering that relies on the location frequency table and the timestamp frequency table the bbac i co clustering is more efficient and easier to operate because theoretically speaking bbac i only requires the numbers of location clusters and the timestamp clusters after the numbers are determined bbac i can yield the location clusters and the timestamp clusters simultaneously in this sense the bbac i co clustering is more attractive than the hca one way clustering for understanding groundwater geochemistry in space and time although the similar results of the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering indicate that our empirical approaches are practical for handling the four issues of bbac i co clustering discussed in section 3 2 the empirical approaches are subject to three theoretical and practical limitations the first limitation is when removing monitoring wells and or sampling campaigns to meet the data completeness requirement of bbac i co clustering i e groundwater geochemical parameters are measured at every monitoring well and every sampling campaign certain location and timestamp clusters may be missed in this study cluster c1 was missed by the bbac i co clustering due to removing six wells the second limitation is that using only one principal component may result in loss of information regarding groundwater geochemistry this may be the reason that the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering yielded similar but different location clusters the third limitation is that the bbac i co clustering requires specifying the numbers of location and timestamp clusters a prior because the numbers are unknown in practice while the numbers can be determined by using the results of the hca one way clustering a better approach is needed so that the numbers can be determined independently within the bbac i co clustering this may be done by using optimization algorithms e g genetic algorithms and or statistical method e g the elbow method used in k means clustering to address the three limitations requires a theoretical study that however is beyond the scope of this study 8 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt of using the bbac i co clustering for understanding spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry there are four issues that are barriers to directly applying bbac i clustering to groundwater geochemical data and the four issues were addressed by four empirical approaches as follows 1 removing monitoring wells and or sampling campaigns where and when groundwater geochemical data are unavailable 2 applying pca to remaining data and using the first principal component scores for bbac i co clustering 3 applying the min max normalization to the scores so that all the data are positive for bbac i co clustering and 4 using the number of location and timestamp clusters determined from the hca one way clustering after applying the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering to the groundwater geochemical data collected from the dagu river basin we found that it is feasible to use the bbac i co clustering together with our empirical solutions for simultaneously identifying locations and timestamp clusters this study applies the hca one way clustering and the bbac i co clustering to the 9 geochemical parameters ph ca2 mg2 nak cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and f of 327 groundwater samples collected from 19 monitoring wells over the period of 2000 2017 in the unconfined aquifer of dagu river basin the clustering analyses delineate two groundwater geochemical zones i e the downgradient residual seawater freshening zone and the upgradient fertilizer nitrogen zone there are three controlling factors of the two zones and they are residual seawater freshening in the downgradient zone elevated no3 concentrations due to anthropogenic activity in the entire aquifer and agricultural fertilizer uses in the upgradient zone and silicate weathering due to water rock interaction over the entire aquifer the clustering analyses yield three groundwater geochemical periods i e the baseline period before the sampling campaign of 2011 4 the transition period for the three sampling campaigns of 2011 9 2012 4 and 2012 9 and the drought period after the sampling campaign of 2013 7 the temporal changes of groundwater geochemistry between the three periods were caused by the following two factors 1 ca2 and mg2 dilution and co2 introduction by the heavy precipitation in july 2011 that caused the change from the baseline period to the transition period and 2 ceased flow of the dagu river after 2013 due to drought and anthropogenic activities in the drought period the impacts of drought conditions and anthropogenic activities in the dagu river basin on groundwater geochemistry should be considered for managing groundwater resources of the basin credit authorship contribution statement honghua liu
