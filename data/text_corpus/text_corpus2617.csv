sildenafil and testosterone the target pharmaceuticals were selected based on their widespread environmental occurrence in asia 17 21 the chemical properties of the target compounds are summarized in table 2 all target pharmaceuticals solvents and chemical reagents were purchased from sigma aldrich saint louis mo usa and fluka seelze germany with high purity grade 98 the isotopically labeled standards were also purchased from sigma aldrich and toronto research chemicals toronto on canada a 10 mg l standard solution of each pharmaceutical was prepared based on their dissolution characteristics by using an appropriate solvent methanol water and 0 1 n hcl and stored at 4 c until use 2 3 analysis of target pharmaceuticals for liquid phase sample analysis 50 ml of each sample was filtered with a 0 45 μm pore size filter a filtered sample quantity of 900 μl was transferred into amber auto sampler vials 2 ml and combined with 100 μl 1 formic acid 10 μl of 40 mg ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate na2edta and 10 μl of 10 μg l isotopically labeled standards for solid phase sample the quick easy cheap effective rugged and safe quechers method which is used for the analysis of nsaids antibiotics and pesticides affixed on various solids samples such as swine manure sewage sludge and soil 24 26 was applied for solid phase sample analysis 50 ml of each sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min after centrifugation 1g wet mass of the residual solids was combined with 5 ml of 1 acetic acid 10 ml of acetonitrile 2 g of na2so4 0 2 ml of 40 mg ml na2edta and 100 μl of 100 μg l isotopically labeled standards using a vortex mixer for 1 min the mixture was centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 5 min and 1 ml of the acetonitrile layer was transferred to a glass tube and concentrated using a nitrogen concentrator after concentration the sample was dissolved with 10 ml of a mixture solvent comprising 0 1 formic acid and methanol at a mixing ratio of 9 1 and then filtered using a 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf syringe filter to prevent the inflow of impurities from the extraction process the filtered supernatant and residual solids after sample filtration were pretreated using the same method as those used for the liquid and solids phase samples respectively next 300 μl of the pretreated sample was analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms nexera x2 lc lcms 8050 ms shimadzu co coupled with online solid phase extraction spe which is commonly applied for clean up the interferences in the original matrix the ace 5 c18 pfp 150 2 1 mm and mayi ods g 2 0 10 mm columns were used for lc and online spe respectively the operating conditions of the online spe lc ms ms are presented in table a 1 2 4 quality control the linearity limit of detection lod limit of quantification loq and recoveries of the target pharmaceuticals in both liquid and solid phase samples are summarized in table a 2 a 4 linearity was calculated by linear regression analysis with an eleven point dilution of standard solution in the range of 0 10 000 ng l calibration curve the lod and loq were determined from fortified water samples with signal to noise s n ratios of 3 and 10 on the chromatogram respectively the recoveries of target pharmaceuticals in the liquid phase samples were determined by spiking the mixed standard solutions of all 27 pharmaceuticals to concentration ranges of 10 100 ng l 400 4000 ng l and 800 8000 ng l respectively the mixed standard solutions were fortified to achieve final concentrations of 10 ng g 50 ng g and 100 ng g in 1 g wet mass of the activated sludge collected from wwtp a c respectively the recoveries of target compounds and surrogates in the liquid phase were calculated as a percentage of the measured concentration to the concentration of the mixed standard solution and the recoveries of those in the solid phase were calculated as a percentage of the measured concentration difference of spiked and unspiked samples with the concentration of the mixed standard solution the recoveries of pharmaceuticals were 91 0 117 2 for liquid phase samples and 61 3 137 2 for solid phase samples in the extraction stage of pretreatment surrogate recovery was also in the range of 60 130 2 5 calculation of sorption coefficient and biodegradability sorption is an important mechanism for the mitigation of pharmaceuticals in municipal wwtps the possibility of pharmaceuticals sorption to biosolids can be predicted by the sorption coefficient kd and this qualitative indicator of sorption behavior can also be calculated typically as follows 1 k d c s mlss c w 10 6 kgmlss mgmlss where kd is the sorption coefficient of activated sludge l kgmlss cs is the pharmaceuticals concentration in solid phase ng l mlss is the mixed liquor suspended solids concentration mgmlss l and cw is the pharmaceuticals concentration in liquid phase ng l biodegradation is also a major pathway of pharmaceutical mitigation in wastewater treatment to evaluate the biodegradation of soluble pharmaceuticals the kinetic constant kbiol from pseudo first order kinetics described by joss et al 69 was used 2 ds t dt k biol mlss s 0 where st is the concentration of pharmaceuticals in liquid phase at time t ng l t is the hydraulic retention time h kbiol is the biodegradation constant l gmlss d mlss is the mixed liquor suspended solids concentration gmlss l and s0 is the initial concentration of pharmaceuticals in the liquid phase ng l 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal assessment of pharmaceuticals in wwtps table 3 summarizes the minimum maximum and average concentrations of target pharmaceuticals in the influent and effluent of the selected municipal wwtps among the target pharmaceuticals seven pharmaceuticals showed higher average concentrations in the influent irrespective of regional differences namely acetaminophen acetylsalicylic acid caffeine cimetidine clarithromycin ibuprofen and naproxen the removal of these pharmaceuticals except for cimetidine and clarithromycin were relatively higher than that of others despite the differences in process configuration acetaminophen acetylsalicylic acid caffeine cefradine and naproxen were dramatically mitigated and the removal of these pharmaceuticals was as high as 99 6 100 95 3 100 99 7 100 80 2 100 and 94 2 99 5 respectively the contribution of biological wastewater treatment for the removal of these pharmaceuticals has also been elucidated in previous studies 17 18 20 27 30 however elevated concentrations of carbamazepine diclofenac diphenhydramine and propranolol in the effluent of each wwtp indicated that the accumulation of these pharmaceuticals in wwtps is due to their persistence in biological wastewater treatment 31 34 du et al 35 emphasized that the deconjugation of conjugated propranolol during phase ii metabolism which defined in pharmacokinetics occurs for many pharmaceuticals and may elevate the concentration of propranolol in effluent tertiary treatments such as activated carbon ultraviolet h2o2 fenton oxidation and ozonation may be helpful for the mitigation of pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine and diclofenac 11 13 reverse osmosis is a practical method for controlling recalcitrant pharmaceuticals in water reclamation 36 37 therefore to meet the future water quality regulations additional processes as mentioned above should be prepared as same as water reclamation level compared to analgesics nsaids pharmaceuticals the concentrations of selected antibiotics in the influents were relatively low and the average removal varied significantly from 226 to 98 3 blair et al 38 summarized the possible reasons for negative pharmaceuticals and personal care products removals in wwtps as follows 1 inappropriate fluid dynamics e g short circuiting 2 deconjugation of conjugated compounds and 3 desorption from the return activated sludge the average removals of macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin erythromycin and roxithromycin in wwtp a which employed the membrane bioreactor mbr process were superior to the removal in other wwtps in general biodegradation sorption by biosolids photodegradation and volatilization are major mechanisms of pharmaceutical removal in the mbr process 39 however the photodegradation and volatilization mechanisms can be negligible for the removal of pharmaceuticals in biological wastewater treatment due to the high turbidity of mixed liquor in the biological reactor and lower henry s constant of pharmaceuticals respectively 3 15 40 in this respect the mbr process enhanced the removal of pharmaceuticals mainly through the pathways of biodegradation and sorption to biosolids the mbr process has a low food to microorganism ratio owing to the high mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration derived from longer the solids retention time srt and membrane application therefore the utilization of non biodegradable pharmaceuticals could occur with acclimated microorganisms alvarino et al 41 elucidated that the biodegradation of complex compounds could occur due to an increase in microbial diversity because of a long srt blair et al 38 also showed the possibility of the biodegradation of clarithromycin and roxithromycin in wastewater treatment on the other hand studies on the removal of macrolide antibiotics in biological wastewater treatment reported that macrolide antibiotics existing in cationic form at a ph range of 6 8 can easily sorb to biosolids that are negatively charged at the same ph 4 42 44 hence securing a high concentration of biosolids to act as sorbent is essential for the removal of macrolide antibiotics theoretically a longer srt can increase the biosolid concentration in the bio reactor however the net biosolid growth rate and srt have an inversely proportional relationship 45 therefore the mass of newly produced biosolids that acts as sorbents can decrease under a long srt 46 despite the small difference in the average srt between wwtp a and wwtp c table 1 the average removal of macrolide antibiotics in wwtp a was relatively higher than that in wwtp c owing to the electrostatic interactions derived from a high concentration of biosolids that act as sorbents consequently sorption was the primary removal mechanism of macrolide antibiotics in the mbr process which was associated with the biosolid concentration 3 2 distribution of pharmaceuticals in liquid and solid phase based on the concentration results of influents and effluents presented in table 3 we selected 12 pharmaceuticals that showed positive removal in biological treatment of each wwtp during all sampling campaigns namely acetaminophen acetylsalicylic acid ibuprofen ketoprofen naproxen cefradine ciprofloxacin ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole atenolol caffeine and gemfibrozil among the pharmaceuticals classified as analgesics nsaids the highest average concentration in the influent was for acetaminophen 32 370 43 900 ng l followed by that of acetylsalicylic acid 4940 6510 ng l ibuprofen 1315 3732 ng l naproxen 2 270 3340 ng l and ketoprofen 114 347 ng l as depicted in fig 2 most of these pharmaceuticals were mainly observed in the liquid phase of the influent 3 2 1 analgesics nsaids concentrations of acetaminophen and naproxen in the liquid phase sharply decreased by 3 4 orders of magnitude as the wwtp process progressed however the concentrations in the solid phase remained relatively constant this result indirectly suggests that the biodegradation of acetaminophen and naproxen can be accomplished in wwtps although a high removal potential of ibuprofen has been reported using biological treatment 19 21 47 a temporarily elevated concentration in both liquid and solid phases was clearly observed in the first biological unit process of all wwtps owing to the deconjugation of ibuprofen which was introduced to wwtps in conjugated or metabolized forms and at various return flows the profiles of acetylsalicylic acid in each wwtp showed a high sorption potential to biosolids the average concentration of acetylsalicylic acid in the solid phase increased to 12 480 ng l wwtp a 2880 ng l wwtp b and 4370 ng l wwtp c therefore the concentration of mlss could be a governing factor for diminishing the concentration of acetylsalicylic acid by sorption in biological wastewater treatment and ensuring sufficient biosolid is imperative for improving pharmaceuticals mitigation 3 2 2 antibiotics profiles of selected antibiotics in each wwtp are illustrated in fig 3 among the selected antibiotics the highest average concentration in the influent was for cefradine 438 1104 ng l followed by that of ofloxacin 133 359 ng l ciprofloxacin 40 1 247 ng l and sulfamethoxazole 74 9 259 ng l sorption plays a significant role in diminishing antibiotics in wwtps and it is a major pathway for the mitigation of antibiotics in biological wastewater treatment 48 49 the concentration variation of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in this study follows an ordinary phenomenon compared to the average concentration in the influent the concentration increased by approximately 11 107 times ciprofloxacin and 6 56 times ofloxacin in the solid phase the sorption of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin classified as quinolone antibiotics can easily occur by electrostatic interactions between the positively charged nitrogen atom of quinolone antibiotics and negatively charged colloidal particles of biomass 50 as shown in fig 3 although sulfamethoxazole is an antibiotic pharmaceutical its sorption was not significant some studies on the removal mechanisms of sulfamethoxazole elucidated that the mitigation of its concentration in wastewater treatment could be accomplished by both biodegradation and sorption 51 52 furthermore sorption could be less efficient for sulfamethoxazole mitigation because sulfonamide antibiotics are electrically neutral or negative in wastewater at ph of 7 50 studies on the removal of cephalosporin antibiotics have reported the limited efficacy of conventional biological wastewater treatment due to their anti microbial impact on the microorganisms responsible for biodegradation 53 cefradine was the cephalosporin antibiotics investigated in this study photo transformation and a combined system of algae and biological wastewater treatment have been suggested for mitigating cephalosporin antibiotics because of its resistance to biodegradation 19 54 56 however as represented in fig 3 the cefradine concentration in the liquid phase decreased dramatically irrespective of the process configuration the qualitative detection of cefradine in the solid phase that is the possibility of sorption to biosolids was relatively lower than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin table 4 the result of cefradine in wwtp a which employed the mbr process demonstrated the necessity of considering the role of biodegradation in biological wastewater treatment for the mitigation of cefradine 3 2 3 others in wwtp a a drastic increase in the atenolol concentration in the solid phase was clearly observed fig 4 although previous studies reported the possibility of removing atenolol in batch type bench scale biological wastewater treatment setups 9 57 the mitigation of its concentration was not significant in this study except in wwtp a inyang et al 57 found a lower removal of atenolol in a continuous flow wastewater treatment system than in the batch type in addition the high dispersion and high excretion rate of atenolol as a persistent drug may explain its lower removal rate in wastewater treatment 58 59 as shown in fig 4 a relatively high removal of gemfibrozil was observed in the mbr process the improved biodegradability of gemfibrozil under aerobic conditions compared to that under anaerobic conditions has been reported 57 here a slight mitigation of gemfibrozil was observed in the aerobic reactors of wwtp b and wwtp c 3 3 evaluating the sorption to biosolids table 4 demonstrates the kd values of selected pharmaceuticals in this study and those reported in previous studies higher kd values are reported in this study compared to previous studies although a significant variation in kd values can be caused by single point calculations and differences in analysis methods for biomass inactivation 15 the sorption capacity is proportional to the kd value 60 61 notably the evaluation of the kd value with qualitative detection in the solid phase is necessary to accurately assess pharmaceuticals mitigation by sorption for example the mitigation of acetylsalicylic acid ciprofloxacin ibuprofen and ofloxacin by sorption in each wwtp seems to be feasible however it is inadequate to use only the kd value to evaluate the sorption of acetaminophen caffeine and cefradine in wwtp b owing to their lower qualitative detection in the solid phase in addition the physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals such as log octanol water partitioning coefficient kow acid dissociation constant pka ionization state and molecular structures could be a function of the sorption mechanism 15 according to luo et al 68 pharmaceuticals with log kow value greater than 4 0 have high sorption potential kd 1000 l kgmlss whereas pharmaceutical with log kow value smaller than 2 5 have low sorption potential kd 300 l kgmlss however ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin classified as quinolones antibiotics which exhibit hydrophilic characteristics log kow 2 5 showed higher sorption potential in this study kd 8000 l kgmlss than previous reports kd 12 000 l kgmlss 67 the sorption of these pharmaceuticals to biosolids is mainly attributed to electrostatic interactions therefore a comprehensive analysis including the qualitative detection of pharmaceuticals in the solid phase with calculated kd values kow value and ionization states is necessary to determine the sorption potential of pharmaceuticals 3 4 biodegradability evaluation table 5 summarizes the kbiol values of selected pharmaceuticals in this study and those reported in previous studies in this study the kbiol was only calculated for the first two biological reactors anaerobic and anoxic which showed significant decreases in selected pharmaceuticals in the liquid phase figs 2 4 the kbiol values in this study were relatively lower than those of previous studies most bench scale studies on pharmaceutical biodegradation have been conducted in batch type reactors with pharmaceutical concentrations ranging from a few 10 μg l to several mg l which are 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than those in the influent in our study therefore the lower kbiol values for some pharmaceuticals could be explained by lower δst values in eq 2 derived from the lower concentrations in the influent despite the high biodegradation potential of some pharmaceuticals moreover because the variation in pharmaceuticals was only considered in the liquid phase it was difficult to determine whether their reduced concentration in the liquid phase was due to biodegradation or sorption by electrostatic interaction for example in the anaerobic reactor of wwtp a the calculated kbiol value of ciprofloxacin 0 41 5 07 l gmlss d which was mitigated using electrostatic interaction was similar to that of caffeine 0 84 5 20 l gmlss d which reported a high biodegradability in wastewater treatment thus the simultaneous analysis of both liquid and solid phases is recommended for a detailed fate evaluation of pharmaceuticals in the biological processes of municipal wastewater treatment plants 4 conclusion in this study the occurrence and fate of 27 pharmaceuticals inflow to full scale municipal wwtps with various biological treatment processes were evaluated and the fates of 12 selected pharmaceuticals in both liquid and solid phases were evaluated the performance results showed that the mitigation of highly degradable pharmaceuticals including acetaminophen acetylsalicylic acid caffeine cefradine and naproxen occurs irrespective of process configuration the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals decreased by 2 4 orders of magnitude as the wwtp process progressed we also confirmed that the mbr process can efficiently mitigate the concentration of macrolide antibiotics through electrostatic interactions as it maintains a high concentration of biosolids that act as sorbents the biodegradation and sorption potential for the 12 selected pharmaceuticals which showed positive removals in the biological treatment of each wwtp during all sampling campaigns were evaluated by calculating the kbiol and kd values respectively compared with previous literature this study showed that the appropriate pharmaceuticals mitigation mechanism in biological wastewater treatment was not only determined by these constants but also by other factors including qualitative detection frequency operating conditions and physicochemical properties overall the simultaneous analysis of both liquid and solid phase is highly recommended to better understand the appropriate mitigation mechanisms of

fortified to achieve final concentrations of 10 ng g 50 ng g and 100 ng g in 1 g wet mass of the activated sludge collected from wwtp a c respectively the recoveries of target compounds and surrogates in the liquid phase were calculated as a percentage of the measured concentration to the concentration of the mixed standard solution and the recoveries of those in the solid phase were calculated as a percentage of the measured concentration difference of spiked and unspiked samples with the concentration of the mixed standard solution the recoveries of pharmaceuticals were 91 0 117 2 for liquid phase samples and 61 3 137 2 for solid phase samples in the extraction stage of pretreatment surrogate recovery was also in the range of 60 130 2 5 calculation of sorption coefficient and biodegradability sorption is an important mechanism for the mitigation of pharmaceuticals in municipal wwtps the possibility of pharmaceuticals sorption to biosolids can be predicted by the sorption coefficient kd and this qualitative indicator of sorption behavior can also be calculated typically as follows 1 k d c s mlss c w 10 6 kgmlss mgmlss where kd is the sorption coefficient of activated sludge l kgmlss cs is the pharmaceuticals concentration in solid phase ng l mlss is the mixed liquor suspended solids concentration mgmlss l and cw is the pharmaceuticals concentration in liquid phase ng l biodegradation is also a major pathway of pharmaceutical mitigation in wastewater treatment to evaluate the biodegradation of soluble pharmaceuticals the kinetic constant kbiol from pseudo first order kinetics described by joss et al 69 was used 2 ds t dt k biol mlss s 0 where st is the concentration of pharmaceuticals in liquid phase at time t ng l t is the hydraulic retention time h kbiol is the biodegradation constant l gmlss d mlss is the mixed liquor suspended solids concentration gmlss l and s0 is the initial concentration of pharmaceuticals in the liquid phase ng l 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal assessment of pharmaceuticals in wwtps table 3 summarizes the minimum maximum and average concentrations of target pharmaceuticals in the influent and effluent of the selected municipal wwtps among the target pharmaceuticals seven pharmaceuticals showed higher average concentrations in the influent irrespective of regional differences namely acetaminophen acetylsalicylic acid caffeine cimetidine clarithromycin ibuprofen and naproxen the removal of these pharmaceuticals except for cimetidine and clarithromycin were relatively higher than that of others despite the differences in process configuration acetaminophen acetylsalicylic acid caffeine cefradine and naproxen were dramatically mitigated and the removal of these pharmaceuticals was as high as 99 6 100 95 3 100 99 7 100 80 2 100 and 94 2 99 5 respectively the contribution of biological wastewater treatment for the removal of these pharmaceuticals has also been elucidated in previous studies 17 18 20 27 30 however elevated concentrations of carbamazepine diclofenac diphenhydramine and propranolol in the effluent of each wwtp indicated that the accumulation of these pharmaceuticals in wwtps is due to their persistence in biological wastewater treatment 31 34 du et al 35 emphasized that the deconjugation of conjugated propranolol during phase ii metabolism which defined in pharmacokinetics occurs for many pharmaceuticals and may elevate the concentration of propranolol in effluent tertiary treatments such as activated carbon ultraviolet h2o2 fenton oxidation and ozonation may be helpful for the mitigation of pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine and diclofenac 11 13 reverse osmosis is a practical method for controlling recalcitrant pharmaceuticals in water reclamation 36 37 therefore to meet the future water quality regulations additional processes as mentioned above should be prepared as same as water reclamation level compared to analgesics nsaids pharmaceuticals the concentrations of selected antibiotics in the influents were relatively low and the average removal varied significantly from 226 to 98 3 blair et al 38 summarized the possible reasons for negative pharmaceuticals and personal care products removals in wwtps as follows 1 inappropriate fluid dynamics e g short circuiting 2 deconjugation of conjugated compounds and 3 desorption from the return activated sludge the average removals of macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin erythromycin and roxithromycin in wwtp a which employed the membrane bioreactor mbr process were superior to the removal in other wwtps in general biodegradation sorption by biosolids photodegradation and volatilization are major mechanisms of pharmaceutical removal in the mbr process 39 however the photodegradation and volatilization mechanisms can be negligible for the removal of pharmaceuticals in biological wastewater treatment due to the high turbidity of mixed liquor in the biological reactor and lower henry s constant of pharmaceuticals respectively 3 15 40 in this respect the mbr process enhanced the removal of pharmaceuticals mainly through the pathways of biodegradation and sorption to biosolids the mbr process has a low food to microorganism ratio owing to the high mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration derived from longer the solids retention time srt and membrane application therefore the utilization of non biodegradable pharmaceuticals could occur with acclimated microorganisms alvarino et al 41 elucidated that the biodegradation of complex compounds could occur due to an increase in microbial diversity because of a long srt blair et al 38 also showed the possibility of the biodegradation of clarithromycin and roxithromycin in wastewater treatment on the other hand studies on the removal of macrolide antibiotics in biological wastewater treatment reported that macrolide antibiotics existing in cationic form at a ph range of 6 8 can easily sorb to biosolids that are negatively charged at the same ph 4 42 44 hence securing a high concentration of biosolids to act as sorbent is essential for the removal of macrolide antibiotics theoretically a longer srt can increase the biosolid concentration in the bio reactor however the net biosolid growth rate and srt have an inversely proportional relationship 45 therefore the mass of newly produced biosolids that acts as sorbents can decrease under a long srt 46 despite the small difference in the average srt between wwtp a and wwtp c table 1 the average removal of macrolide antibiotics in wwtp a was relatively higher than that in wwtp c owing to the electrostatic interactions derived from a high concentration of biosolids that act as sorbents consequently sorption was the primary removal mechanism of macrolide antibiotics in the mbr process which was associated with the biosolid concentration 3 2 distribution of pharmaceuticals in liquid and solid phase based on the concentration results of influents and effluents presented in table 3 we selected 12 pharmaceuticals that showed positive removal in biological treatment of each wwtp during all sampling campaigns namely acetaminophen acetylsalicylic acid ibuprofen ketoprofen naproxen cefradine ciprofloxacin ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole atenolol caffeine and gemfibrozil among the pharmaceuticals classified as analgesics nsaids the highest average concentration in the influent was for acetaminophen 32 370 43 900 ng l followed by that of acetylsalicylic acid 4940 6510 ng l ibuprofen 1315 3732 ng l naproxen 2 270 3340 ng l and ketoprofen 114 347 ng l as depicted in fig 2 most of these pharmaceuticals were mainly observed in the liquid phase of the influent 3 2 1 analgesics nsaids concentrations of acetaminophen and naproxen in the liquid phase sharply decreased by 3 4 orders of magnitude as the wwtp process progressed however the concentrations in the solid phase remained relatively constant this result indirectly suggests that the biodegradation of acetaminophen and naproxen can be accomplished in wwtps although a high removal potential of ibuprofen has been reported using biological treatment 19 21 47 a temporarily elevated concentration in both liquid and solid phases was clearly observed in the first biological unit process of all wwtps owing to the deconjugation of ibuprofen which was introduced to wwtps in conjugated or metabolized forms and at various return flows the profiles of acetylsalicylic acid in each wwtp showed a high sorption potential to biosolids the average concentration of acetylsalicylic acid in the solid phase increased to 12 480 ng l wwtp a 2880 ng l wwtp b and 4370 ng l wwtp c therefore the concentration of mlss could be a governing factor for diminishing the concentration of acetylsalicylic acid by sorption in biological wastewater treatment and ensuring sufficient biosolid is imperative for improving pharmaceuticals mitigation 3 2 2 antibiotics profiles of selected antibiotics in each wwtp are illustrated in fig 3 among the selected antibiotics the highest average concentration in the influent was for cefradine 438 1104 ng l followed by that of ofloxacin 133 359 ng l ciprofloxacin 40 1 247 ng l and sulfamethoxazole 74 9 259 ng l sorption plays a significant role in diminishing antibiotics in wwtps and it is a major pathway for the mitigation of antibiotics in biological wastewater treatment 48 49 the concentration variation of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in this study follows an ordinary phenomenon compared to the average concentration in the influent the concentration increased by approximately 11 107 times ciprofloxacin and 6 56 times ofloxacin in the solid phase the sorption of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin classified as quinolone antibiotics can easily occur by electrostatic interactions between the positively charged nitrogen atom of quinolone antibiotics and negatively charged colloidal particles of biomass 50 as shown in fig 3 although sulfamethoxazole is an antibiotic pharmaceutical its sorption was not significant some studies on the removal mechanisms of sulfamethoxazole elucidated that the mitigation of its concentration in wastewater treatment could be accomplished by both biodegradation and sorption 51 52 furthermore sorption could be less efficient for sulfamethoxazole mitigation because sulfonamide antibiotics are electrically neutral or negative in wastewater at ph of 7 50 studies on the removal of cephalosporin antibiotics have reported the limited efficacy of conventional biological wastewater treatment due to their anti microbial impact on the microorganisms responsible for biodegradation 53 cefradine was the cephalosporin antibiotics investigated in this study photo transformation and a combined system of algae and biological wastewater treatment have been suggested for mitigating cephalosporin antibiotics because of its resistance to biodegradation 19 54 56 however as represented in fig 3 the cefradine concentration in the liquid phase decreased dramatically irrespective of the process configuration the qualitative detection of cefradine in the solid phase that is the possibility of sorption to biosolids was relatively lower than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin table 4 the result of cefradine in wwtp a which employed the mbr process demonstrated the necessity of considering the role of biodegradation in biological wastewater treatment for the mitigation of cefradine 3 2 3 others in wwtp a a drastic increase in the atenolol concentration in the solid phase was clearly observed fig 4 although previous studies reported the possibility of removing atenolol in batch type bench scale biological wastewater treatment setups 9 57 the mitigation of its concentration was not significant in this study except in wwtp a inyang et al 57 found a lower removal of atenolol in a continuous flow wastewater treatment system than in the batch type in addition the high dispersion and high excretion rate of atenolol as a persistent drug may explain its lower removal rate in wastewater treatment 58 59 as shown in fig 4 a relatively high removal of gemfibrozil was observed in the mbr process the improved biodegradability of gemfibrozil under aerobic conditions compared to that under anaerobic conditions has been reported 57 here a slight mitigation of gemfibrozil was observed in the aerobic reactors of wwtp b and wwtp c 3 3 evaluating the sorption to biosolids table 4 demonstrates the kd values of selected pharmaceuticals in this study and those reported in previous studies higher kd values are reported in this study compared to previous studies although a significant variation in kd values can be caused by single point calculations and differences in analysis methods for biomass inactivation 15 the sorption capacity is proportional to the kd value 60 61 notably the evaluation of the kd value with qualitative detection in the solid phase is necessary to accurately assess pharmaceuticals mitigation by sorption for example the mitigation of acetylsalicylic acid ciprofloxacin ibuprofen and ofloxacin by sorption in each wwtp seems to be feasible however it is inadequate to use only the kd value to evaluate the sorption of acetaminophen caffeine and cefradine in wwtp b owing to their lower qualitative detection in the solid phase in addition the physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals such as log octanol water partitioning coefficient kow acid dissociation constant pka ionization state and molecular structures could be a function of the sorption mechanism 15 according to luo et al 68 pharmaceuticals with log kow value greater than 4 0 have high sorption potential kd 1000 l kgmlss whereas pharmaceutical with log kow value smaller than 2 5 have low sorption potential kd 300 l kgmlss however ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin classified as quinolones antibiotics which exhibit hydrophilic characteristics log kow 2 5 showed higher sorption potential in this study kd 8000 l kgmlss than previous reports kd 12 000 l kgmlss 67 the sorption of these pharmaceuticals to biosolids is mainly attributed to electrostatic interactions therefore a comprehensive analysis including the qualitative detection of pharmaceuticals in the solid phase with calculated kd values kow value and ionization states is necessary to determine the sorption potential of pharmaceuticals 3 4 biodegradability evaluation table 5 summarizes the kbiol values of selected pharmaceuticals in this study and those reported in previous studies in this study the kbiol was only calculated for the first two biological reactors anaerobic and anoxic which showed significant decreases in selected pharmaceuticals in the liquid phase figs 2 4 the kbiol values in this study were relatively lower than those of previous studies most bench scale studies on pharmaceutical biodegradation have been conducted in batch type reactors with pharmaceutical concentrations ranging from a few 10 μg l to several mg l which are 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than those in the influent in our study therefore the lower kbiol values for some pharmaceuticals could be explained by lower δst values in eq 2 derived from the lower concentrations in the influent despite the high biodegradation potential of some pharmaceuticals moreover because the variation in pharmaceuticals was only considered in the liquid phase it was difficult to determine whether their reduced concentration in the liquid phase was due to biodegradation or sorption by electrostatic interaction for example in the anaerobic reactor of wwtp a the calculated kbiol value of ciprofloxacin 0 41 5 07 l gmlss d which was mitigated using electrostatic interaction was similar to that of caffeine 0 84 5 20 l gmlss d which reported a high biodegradability in wastewater treatment thus the simultaneous analysis of both liquid and solid phases is recommended for a detailed fate evaluation of pharmaceuticals in the biological processes of municipal wastewater treatment plants 4 conclusion in this study the occurrence and fate of 27 pharmaceuticals inflow to full scale municipal wwtps with various biological treatment processes were evaluated and the fates of 12 selected pharmaceuticals in both liquid and solid phases were evaluated the performance results showed that the mitigation of highly degradable pharmaceuticals including acetaminophen acetylsalicylic acid caffeine cefradine and naproxen occurs irrespective of process configuration the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals decreased by 2 4 orders of magnitude as the wwtp process progressed we also confirmed that the mbr process can efficiently mitigate the concentration of macrolide antibiotics through electrostatic interactions as it maintains a high concentration of biosolids that act as sorbents the biodegradation and sorption potential for the 12 selected pharmaceuticals which showed positive removals in the biological treatment of each wwtp during all sampling campaigns were evaluated by calculating the kbiol and kd values respectively compared with previous literature this study showed that the appropriate pharmaceuticals mitigation mechanism in biological wastewater treatment was not only determined by these constants but also by other factors including qualitative detection frequency operating conditions and physicochemical properties overall the simultaneous analysis of both liquid and solid phase is highly recommended to better understand the appropriate mitigation mechanisms of

13086,in this paper a series of copper oxide supported manganese dioxide cuxmnt composites were prepared by the hydrothermal and deposition precipitation methods the effects of different hydrothermal temperatures 100 c 180 c and copper doping amounts 1 10 mm on the structural and physicochemical properties of cuxmnt composites were systematically investigated the bet sem and xrd characterizations revealed that the cuxmnt composites exhibited a typical rod like structure besides with the increscent hydrothermal temperature the bet specific surface area decreased and the crystal form of the composites changed from α mno2 to β mno2 the cu1mn180 with low specific surface area 3 277 m2 g 1 exhibited the splendid catalytic ozonation activity and the oxalic acid oa removal rate reached 87 5 in o3 cu1mn180 process compared with single ozonation 3 2 additionally it was noteworthy that the excellent catalytic performance of cu1mn180 91 8 of oa removal rate at ph 3 0 was resulted from the electrostatic adsorption while the complexation played a vital role for oa degradation at ph 6 0 and 9 0 with the oa removal efficiencies of 87 5 and 70 3 within 30 min respectively furthermore cu1mn180 could obtain more than 90 9 of oa removal rate during multiple consecutive cycles representing the satisfactory stability and reusability moreover the multivalent mn the structural oxygen species and cu species played the key roles for oa degradation in o3 cu1mn180 process at ph 6 0 via the tem esr xps and o2 tpd characterizations overall the results presented a promising alternative material for efficient catalytic ozonation application in water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords β mno2 cu doping oxalic acid heterogeneous catalytic ozonation complexation 1 introduction ozone o3 a powerful oxidant 2 07 v has been extensively used in the decolorization disinfection and refractory pollutants oxidation in water treatment 1 organic compounds could be directly degraded by molecular o3 or indirectly by hydroxyl radicals oh originated from the decomposition of o3 nonetheless the utilization rate of o3 and mineralization efficiencies of pollutants are relatively low in single ozonation process due to the selective oxidization low solubility and poor stability of o3 in water 2 limiting the transformation of o3 to free radicals 3 however the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation could effectively enhance the decomposition of o3 and production of oh leading to the rapid and complete oxidation and mineralization of contaminants 2 the metal oxides 3 carbon containing materials 4 siliceous materials 1 and etc have been demonstrated to be the highly efficient and widely used catalysts in the catalytic ozonation process for pollutants degradation among manganese

into the framework and attached on the surface of mno2 could efficiently promote its catalytic performance with higher electron transfer rate more oxygen vacancies and or larger specific surface area therein cu makes up about 0 005 of the earth s crust which is a kind of cheap metal and easily obtained due to its multi valence and stronger reducibility cu has been commonly used as a dopant for catalysts modification liu et al 19 found that cu embedded into the oms 2 framework via the formation of mn o cu bond could change the original bond structure and the transformation of structural oxygen species in oms 2 resulting in more defect sites enhanced electron transport of multivalent metals and significant improvement of oa degradation yang et al 20 reported that the copper oxide coated on the surface of α mno2 composite cuo vo mno2 exhibited superior catalytic performance for the methyl mercaptan ch3sh elimination by gaseous o3 the cuo could promote the electron transfer at cuo vo mno2 interface facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies expedite the conversion efficiency of ch3sh and strengthen the catalytic stability of mno2 however the catalytic ozonation performance by cu supported on β mno2 for oa degradation has been rarely explored so far in which the in depth study on the effects of different ph and the surface reaction process is still lacking in this work a suite of cuo decorated β mno2 cuxmnt composites was synthesized by the hydrothermal and deposition precipitation dp methods the catalytic ozonation performance of cuxmnt composites with different hydrothermal temperatures and doping amounts were systematically evaluated the specific structure and physicochemical characteristics of the composites were explored via bet sem tem xrd and

discussion 3 1 effects of the temperature and doping amount on cuxmnt composites it is noteworthy that the cuxmnt composites exhibited a typical rod like structure 6 22 and with the hydrothermal temperature increased the stacking degree of the rods increased fig 1 as the hydrothermal temperature varied from 100 c to 180 c the nanorods gradually agglomerated together and evolved into a 100 times larger rod the mean diameter of the nanorod evolved from 0 038 μm cu1mn100 to 4 01 μm cu1mn180 and the mean length increased from 0 41 μm cu1mn100 to 92 9 μm cu1mn180 in addition the elemental composition of cu1mn100 and cu1mn180 table s1 revealed that cu was manifested to be existed in cuxmnt composites while there was no obvious observation of cuo particles on the surface of the composites owning to the high dispersion of trace cu species as summarized in table 1 with the increment of the hydrothermal temperature the bet specific surface area and pore volume of the composites decreased from 40 708 m2 g 1 and 4 871 10 3 cm3 g 1 cu1mn100 to 3 277 m2 g 1 and 1 216 10 3 cm3 g 1 cu1mn180 respectively while the pore size rose from 59 689 å cu1mn120 to 104 765 å cu1mn180 the bet specific surface areas of cuxmn180 composites were quite low 2 456 3 640 m2 g 1 and there was no obvious changing regular with the augment of the cu doping amounts the aggregation of nanorod structure of cuxmnt composites into larger size with the increasing hydrothermal temperature could result in the reduction of bet specific surface area in comparison with the cu doping amount the hydrothermal temperature played a key role on the morphology and crystal structure of the composites moreover the type iv isotherm adsorption equilibrium of cuxmnt composites reflected the mesoporous structure formed from the stacking of the nanorods fig s1 23 it is noted from fig 2 that the crystal texture transformed from manganese oxide cu1mn100 cu1mn120 and cu1mn140 pdf 44 0141 to pyrolusite cu1mn180 pdf 24 0735 the lattice constants of the manganese oxide were a 9 815 å b 9 815 å c 2 847 å which were consistent with α mno2 while the lattice parameters of the pyrolusite were a 4 388 å b 4 388 å c 2 865 å which were compatible with β mno2 the crystal growth rate and crystallization tendency could be markedly altered with the increscent temperature leading to the crystal phase transformation from α mno2 to β mno2 with the peculiar peaks in cu1mn160 as the transition state 24 25 there was no additional peak of cu species observed in cu1mnt composites fig 2a suggesting the high dispersion of cu species which was consistent with the sem results furthermore the peak intensity of β mno2 distinctly decreased and the diffraction peaks of cuo pdf 48 1548 appeared fig 2b as the cu doping amount raised signifying that cu specie could be physically adsorbed on the surface in the form of cuo the crystal structure of the cuxmn180 composites was still dominated by β mno2 the catalytic ozonation activities of cuxmnt composites towards oa degradation were evaluated fig 3 the oa adsorption via cuxmnt composites could be negligible 2 0 at ph 6 0 as shown in fig 3a the removal efficiencies of oa in o3 cu1mnt processes were 89 0 94 9 in 15 min while only 3 2 of oa was degraded in single ozonation the cu1mnt composites exhibited excellent catalytic ozonation activity towards oa degradation indicating that the hydrothermal temperature had a slight effect on the catalytic activity of cu1mnt composites the possible speculations lied on the dominant roles of cu species other than mno2 or diverse reaction mechanisms involved despite similar catalytic behaviors gao et al 6 reported that α mno2 and β mno2 had similar catalytic activity for no oxidation while the catalytic activity of α mno2 was benefit from the chemisorbed oxygen species while that of β mno2 was influenced by chemisorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen or mn cations it was noted from fig 3b that the catalytic activity of cuxmn180 composites decreased slightly with the increasing cu doping amount which might be resulted from the agglomeration or the occupation of mn sites of the excessive cu species in addition compared with cu1mn100 cu1mn180 composite exhibited higher crystallinity stabilization better sedimentation performance easy recycle characteristics and more promising prospect in practical application moreover the detailed mechanisms in o3 cu1mn180 process would be discussed and elucidated in the following section 3 2 the catalytic ozonation applicability of cu1mn180 composite the effects of cu1mn180 dosage and initial oa concentration on oa degradation in o3 cu1mn180 process were evaluated fig s2 when the cu1mn180 dosage was 200 500 and 1000 mg l 1 the degradation efficiencies of oa in 30 min were 86 7 92 2 and 85 2 respectively fig s2a the increasing dosage of catalysts could provide more active sites to promote the production of active radicals from o3 decomposition and facilitate the degradation of oa however the excessive catalyst would be aggregated and inhibit the availability of the active sites leading to the declined oa removal 19 in addition the degradation efficiencies of oa decreased from 92 2 to 67 3 with the initial oa concentration increased from 30 to 100 mg l 1 fig s2b the excessive oa would compete with the dissolved o3 for the limited surface active sites and reactive oxygen species ros further restricting the degradation of oa 26 it is notable from fig 4a that the removal efficiencies of oa via direct adsorption of cu1mn180 and o3 cu1mn180 process were 35 3 and 91 8 79 8 of toc removal rate as shown in fig s6 within 30 min which were similar with these of mn180 at ph 3 0 suggesting that the β mno2 instead of the surface cuo played a crucial role for efficient oa degradation the electrostatic attraction may take a predominant role for oa removal at ph 3 0 due to the existence of the hydrogen oxalate ion hc2o4 and the protonated surface of cu1mn180 composite phpzc 3 49 mn oh2 and or cu oh2 in solution fig s3 which could facilitate the ros generation and oa elimination during ozonation 27 29 in addition there was maximum 3 64 mg l 1 of mn2 released into the solution during the reaction fig s4 probably posing a slight improvement on oa degradation 30 besides the role of oh at ph 3 0 in o3 cu1mn180 process was identified by the addition of tba 31 in the presence of tba the removal efficiency of oa mildly declined to 81 9 indicating that oh in the bulk solution took a minor part for oa degradation in o3 cu1mn180 process furthermore po4 3 a strong lewis base has a relatively strong affinity for transition metal ions 27 with the existence of po4 3 a distinct inhibitory effect on oa removal was observed resulting in a 43 3 decline in oa removal efficiency at 10 min it s worth noting that the oa removal efficiency recovered to 92 3 within 30 min fig 4a indicating that there still existed other synergistic processes or active sites besides the surface oh groups and the lewis acid sites for the enhanced ozonation degradation of oa at ph 3 0 in o3 cu1mn180 process as depicted in fig 4b less than 2 0 of oa was removed by direct adsorption of mn180 and cu1mn180 at ph 6 0 because of the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged cu1mn180 and oxalate ion c2o4 2 noteworthily the removal efficiencies of oa were 3 2 12 5 and 87 5 79 1 of toc removal rate in fig s6 within 30 min in single ozonation o3 mn180 and o3 cu1mn180 processes respectively the results demonstrated that the presence of cu1mn180 significantly expedited the catalytic ozonation performance of oa degradation and the cu specie could be the dominant active site at ph 6 0 it was probably that the good coordination potential and multivalence properties of cu could increase the superficial active sites and promote the electron transfer of cu1mn180 besides there was a weak leakage of cu2 0 2 mg l 1 and mn2 0 3 mg l 1 after 30 min reaction of which the contributions to the catalytic ozonation could be ignored as illustrated in fig 4b the catalytic ozonation activities were drastically suppressed by the addition of tba and po4 3 and the oa removal efficiencies reduced to 12 8 and 8 5 30 min respectively representing that oh and the surface acid sites played critical roles in o3 cu1mn180 process furthermore the detection of dmpo oh adduct with the four peak intensity ratios of 1 2 2 1 confirming the production of oh in o3 cu1mn180 process fig s5 moreover the strong interference of po4 3 disclosed the role of acid sites involved in the catalytic ozonation and the formation of complexation between oa and cu specie on the catalytic surface could be a key link for efficient oa removal at ph 9 0 fig 4c the adsorption removal of oa by mn180 and cu1mn180 could be neglected 2 0 and attributed to the greater electrostatic repulsion meanwhile the removal efficiencies of oa were 33 0 14 3 and 70 3 30 min 45 4 of toc removal rate in fig s6 in single ozonation o3 mn180 and o3 cu1mn180 processes respectively the cu1mn180 showed favorable catalytic performance in basic solution environment the distinct enhancement of oa degradation during single ozonation was ascribed to the improving oh production derived from the increased decomposition rate of molecular o3 by oh 32 33 the oa removal efficiency in o3 mn180 was lower than that in single ozonation probably because the mn180 caused the ineffective decomposition of o3 34 the semblable suppression performance was achieved in o3 cu1mn180 process with the addition of tba and po4 3 signified the similar catalytic mechanisms existed at ph 6 0 and 9 0 as displayed in fig 5 among four consecutive cycles there was no distinct loss of catalytic properties the oa removal efficiency was 90 9 within 60 min after the 4th run exhibiting excellent stability and industrial application potential in catalytic ozonation the surface morphology of fresh and used cu1mn180 composites were characterized by tem and the images were shown in fig 6 the lattice fringes were clearly visible and the distance between neighboring fringes were 0 31797 nm fresh cu1mn180 and 0 31596 used cu1mn180 respectively which were consistent with the 110 facet of β mno2 35 the morphology of cu1mn180 composite hardly changed during the catalytic ozonation presenting the superb stability of the composite 3 3 reaction mechanism elucidation in o3 cu1mn180 process based on a series of characterization and oxidation experiments the feasible mechanism of the oxidation process at ph 6 0 was speculated as follows the near neutral condition ph 6 0 was closer to the ph of the practical water treatment processes which has potential and significant application prospects 3 3 1 the multivalent mn the survey spectrum and spectra of mn 3 s mn 2p3 2 o 1 s and cu 2p were illustrated in fig 7 the main constituent elements of cu1mn180 composite were mn cu and o fig 7a the average oxidation state aos of the composites could be calculated with the formula aos 8 956 1 126δes where δes means the energy difference between the splitting mn3s peaks as shown in fig 7b 9 36 the aos before and after the catalytic ozonation were 3 69 and 3 71 respectively the increment of average valence state of mn after the ozonation demonstrated the electron transfer among multivalent mn during the reaction besides the mn2p3 2 xps spectrum fig 7c was deconvoluted into three peaks with the binding energy of 643 0 or 643 1 641 8 and 640 1 ev which were attributed to mn4 mn3 and mn2 respectively 37 3 3 2 the function of structural o species for the o1s spectrum in fig 7d the peak with the binding energy of 530 7 ev was assigned as the surface adsorbed oxygen oads including o2 o and oh and another peak of 529 5 ev was denoted as the lattice oxygen olatt 38 the composition of o species on the surface of cu1mn180 was further investigated by o2 tpd analysis as illustrated in fig 8 the peaks appearing at 400 c to 650 c were due to the release of subsurface olatt while the peak emerging above 700 c was attributed to the bulk olatt 38 no obvious peaks occurred when the temperature was lower than 350 c meaning that the release of chemisorbed oxygen molecules and superficial active oxygen species were negligible confirming the extremely low impact posed by surface oh groups noteworthily the peak intensities of used cu1mn180 was higher than that of fresh cu1mn180 fig 8 and there was more olatt generated during the catalytic ozonation indicating the participation of the olatt in o3 cu1mn180 process the reciprocal conversion of multivalent metals mn4 mn3 and mn2 can produce oxygen vacancy ov to maintain the electrostatic balance which would play a crucial role in enhancive catalytic ozonation performance 24 38 the ratios of mn2 mn3 mn4 were 0 93 fresh cu1mn180 and 0 79 used cu1mn180 respectively fig 7c reflecting the higher ov content in fresh cu1mn180 composite the ov played an important role in the absorption of oxidant like o2 24 and o3 38 and the ov made olatt adjacent to the ov more active further promoting the redox properties of oxygen species 24 compared with the fresh cu1mn180 the blurred edge was distinct in used cu1mn180 marked with the red box in tem image fig 6d and the peaks of the used cu1mn180 shifted to the lower temperature in o2 tpd characterization fig 8 indicating that more defects were generated and the olatt in became more active after ozonation reaction with the involvement of ov h2o molecule could occupy the ov to form the surface oh2 eq 3 20 which further react with o3 to yield ho3 eqs 4 6 37 the o2 on the surface of cu1mn180 is released as an oxygen molecule to regenerate the ov eq 7 37 furthermore o3 molecule could also be absorbed on the surface of cu1mn180 via donating an oxygen atom o to replenish an ov whereafter the o3 could react with o2 to generate the intermediate ozone anion radical o3 eq 8 which will convert to ho3 eq 9 and then decompose to produce oh eq 10 39 3 mn ii mn iii o 3 h 2 o mn i v oh 2 o 2 o 2 4 mn i v oh 2 o 3 mn i v oh ho 3 5 mn iv

were located at the binding energy of 934 1 used cu1mn180 and 934 0 ev fresh cu1mn180 denoting the successful decoration of cuo onto the cu1mn180 surface 40 previous researches confirmed that the cuo was able to form multi dentate surface complex with oa 41 42 the py ir characterization was used to identify the b and l acid sites on the surface of the composites 43 it can be seen from fig s7 that the peak at 1605 cm 1 originated from the l acid site was observed and there was no absorption peak corresponding to the b acid site 21 44 further conforming the absence of surface oh groups the acid quantity was calculated according to eqs 1 2 and the results are listed in table 2 the l acidity of cu1mn180 was obviously decreased after the catalytic ozonation based on the tem and o2 tpd results the excellent stability of cu1mn180 composite in the cyclic experiments was ascribed to the induced defects and the active olatt during the catalytic ozonation cu as the l acid site made a huge contribution to the exceptional catalytic performance of cu1mn180 composite cu ii could complex with c2o4 2 41 42 contribute to the rearrangement of electron clouds and then accelerate the electron transfer 27 the complex cu ii c2o4 2 can be oxidized by o3 to generate cu iii c2o4 2 which is highly unstable and further be dissociated into cu ii and oxalate radical c2o4 eqs 11 12 42 in the bulk solution c2o4 reacted with oh to generate co2 and h2o shown as eq 13 the plausible mechanisms for oa degradation involving in o3 cu1mn180 process were elucidated in fig 9 11 cu ii c 2 o 4 2 o 3 cu ii

catalytic ozonation as the hydrothermal temperature elevated the crystal phase of mno2 changed from α mno2 to β mno2 and the bet specific surface area continuingly descended the cu1mn180 with especially low specific surface area 3 277 m2 g 1 exhibited exceptional catalytic ozonation activity the removal efficiencies of oa were 91 8 87 5 and 70 3 at ph 3 0 6 0 and 9 0 respectively the electrostatic attraction between hc2o4 and the protonated cu1mn180 surface was the reliable explanations for efficient oa degradation at ph 3 0 in summary the promoted ozonation of oa via cu1mn180 composite is a complicated multifunctional process involving the participation of multivalent mn the structural o species and cu species in cu1mn180 composite under near neutral and alkaline conditions ultimately the splendid catalytic performance and reusability exhibited that cu1mn180 composite is an encouraging ozonation catalyst with great application potential for removing organic

13086,in this paper a series of copper oxide supported manganese dioxide cuxmnt composites were prepared by the hydrothermal and deposition precipitation methods the effects of different hydrothermal temperatures 100 c 180 c and copper doping amounts 1 10 mm on the structural and physicochemical properties of cuxmnt composites were systematically investigated the bet sem and xrd characterizations revealed that the cuxmnt composites exhibited a typical rod like structure besides with the increscent hydrothermal temperature the bet specific surface area decreased and the crystal form of the composites changed from α mno2 to β mno2 the cu1mn180 with low specific surface area 3 277 m2 g 1 exhibited the splendid catalytic ozonation activity and the oxalic acid oa removal rate reached 87 5 in o3 cu1mn180 process compared with single ozonation 3 2 additionally it was noteworthy that the excellent catalytic performance of cu1mn180 91 8 of oa removal rate at ph 3 0 was resulted from the electrostatic adsorption while the complexation played a vital role for oa degradation at ph 6 0 and 9 0 with the oa removal efficiencies of 87 5 and 70 3 within 30 min respectively furthermore cu1mn180 could obtain more than 90 9 of oa removal rate during multiple consecutive cycles representing the satisfactory stability and reusability moreover the multivalent mn the structural oxygen species and cu species played the key roles for oa degradation in o3 cu1mn180 process at ph 6 0 via the tem esr xps and o2 tpd characterizations overall the results presented a promising alternative material for efficient catalytic ozonation application in water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords β mno2 cu doping oxalic acid heterogeneous catalytic ozonation complexation 1 introduction ozone o3 a powerful oxidant 2 07 v has been extensively used in the decolorization disinfection and refractory pollutants oxidation in water treatment 1 organic compounds could be directly degraded by molecular o3 or indirectly by hydroxyl radicals oh originated from the decomposition of o3 nonetheless the utilization rate of o3 and mineralization efficiencies of pollutants are relatively low in single ozonation process due to the selective oxidization low solubility and poor stability of o3 in water 2 limiting the transformation of o3 to free radicals 3 however the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation could effectively enhance the decomposition of o3 and production of oh leading to the rapid and complete oxidation and mineralization of contaminants 2 the metal oxides 3 carbon containing materials 4 siliceous materials 1 and etc have been demonstrated to be the highly efficient and widely used catalysts in the catalytic ozonation process for pollutants degradation among manganese

elimination of oxalic acid oa 8 4 nitrophenol 9 bisphenol a 10 sulfosalicylic acid propionic acid 11 and etc the incorporation of the metal ions including ce 12 pb 13 cu 14 ag 15 au 16 co 17 and fe 18 into the framework and attached on the surface of mno2 could efficiently promote its catalytic performance with higher electron transfer rate more oxygen vacancies and or larger specific surface area therein cu makes up about 0 005 of the earth s crust which is a kind of cheap metal and easily obtained due to its multi valence and stronger reducibility cu has been commonly used as a dopant for catalysts modification liu et al 19 found that cu embedded into the oms 2 framework via the formation of mn o cu bond could change the original bond structure and the transformation of structural oxygen species in oms 2 resulting in more defect sites enhanced electron transport of multivalent metals and significant improvement of oa degradation yang et al 20 reported that the copper oxide coated on the surface of α mno2 composite cuo vo mno2 exhibited superior catalytic performance for the methyl mercaptan ch3sh elimination by gaseous o3 the cuo could promote the electron transfer at cuo vo mno2 interface facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies expedite the conversion efficiency of ch3sh and strengthen the catalytic stability of mno2 however the catalytic ozonation performance by cu supported on β mno2 for oa degradation has been rarely explored so far in which the in depth study on the effects of different ph and the surface reaction process is still lacking in this work a suite of cuo decorated β mno2 cuxmnt composites was synthesized by the hydrothermal and deposition precipitation dp methods the catalytic ozonation performance of cuxmnt composites with different hydrothermal temperatures and doping amounts were systematically evaluated the specific structure and physicochemical characteristics of the composites were explored via bet sem tem xrd and

13 a certain amount 1 5 and 10 mmol of cucl2 2h2o dissolved in 38 ml ultrapure water was then mixed with 1 g mnt the solution ph was adjusted to 12 0 with dilute naoh solution the suspension was stirred at 60 c for 2 h subsequently the product was washed dried overnight and calcinated at 300 c for 4 h the final composites were denoted as cuxmnt x 1 5 10 with the x referring to the doping amount of cucl2 2h2o 2 3 catalytic ozonation procedure the catalytic ozonation procedure was described in details in our previous research 19 briefly the desirable concentration of oa solution 500 ml

into the solution the reaction was carried out at 20 c 2 c under constant magnetic stirring at predetermined time interval samples were taken out and quenched with na2s2o3 solution after the filtration with 0 22 μm filter samples were injected into chromatographic bottles for further testing the analysis of oa concentration was performed by waters e2695 hplc equipped with the sunfire c18

discussion 3 1 effects of the temperature and doping amount on cuxmnt composites it is noteworthy that the cuxmnt composites exhibited a typical rod like structure 6 22 and with the hydrothermal temperature increased the stacking degree of the rods increased fig 1 as the hydrothermal temperature varied from 100 c to 180 c the nanorods gradually agglomerated together and evolved into a 100 times larger rod the mean diameter of the nanorod evolved from 0 038 μm cu1mn100 to 4 01 μm cu1mn180 and the mean length increased from 0 41 μm cu1mn100 to 92 9 μm cu1mn180 in addition the elemental composition of cu1mn100 and cu1mn180 table s1 revealed that cu was manifested to be existed in cuxmnt composites while there was no obvious observation of cuo particles on the surface of the composites owning to the high dispersion of trace cu species as summarized in table 1 with the increment of the hydrothermal temperature the bet specific surface area and pore volume of the composites decreased from 40 708 m2 g 1 and 4 871 10 3 cm3 g 1 cu1mn100 to 3 277 m2 g 1 and 1 216 10 3 cm3 g 1 cu1mn180 respectively while the pore size rose from 59 689 å cu1mn120 to 104 765 å cu1mn180 the bet specific surface areas of cuxmn180 composites were quite low 2 456 3 640 m2 g 1 and there was no obvious changing regular with the augment of the cu doping amounts the aggregation of nanorod structure of cuxmnt composites into larger size with the increasing hydrothermal temperature could result in the reduction of bet specific surface area in comparison with the cu doping amount the hydrothermal temperature played a key role on the morphology and crystal structure of the composites moreover the type iv isotherm adsorption equilibrium of cuxmnt composites reflected the mesoporous structure formed from the stacking of the nanorods fig s1 23 it is noted from fig 2 that the crystal texture transformed from manganese oxide cu1mn100 cu1mn120 and cu1mn140 pdf 44 0141 to pyrolusite cu1mn180 pdf 24 0735 the lattice constants of the manganese oxide were a 9 815 å b 9 815 å c 2 847 å which were consistent with α mno2 while the lattice parameters of the pyrolusite were a 4 388 å b 4 388 å c 2 865 å which were compatible with β mno2 the crystal growth rate and crystallization tendency could be markedly altered with the increscent temperature leading to the crystal phase transformation from α mno2 to β mno2 with the peculiar peaks in cu1mn160 as the transition state 24 25 there was no additional peak of cu species observed in cu1mnt composites fig 2a suggesting the high dispersion of cu species which was consistent with the sem results furthermore the peak intensity of β mno2 distinctly decreased and the diffraction peaks of cuo pdf 48 1548 appeared fig 2b as the cu doping amount raised signifying that cu specie could be physically adsorbed on the surface in the form of cuo the crystal structure of the cuxmn180 composites was still dominated by β mno2 the catalytic ozonation activities of cuxmnt composites towards oa degradation were evaluated fig 3 the oa adsorption via cuxmnt composites could be negligible 2 0 at ph 6 0 as shown in fig 3a the removal efficiencies of oa in o3 cu1mnt processes were 89 0 94 9 in 15 min while only 3 2 of oa was degraded in single ozonation the cu1mnt composites exhibited excellent catalytic ozonation activity towards oa degradation indicating that the hydrothermal temperature had a slight effect on the catalytic activity of cu1mnt composites the possible speculations lied on the dominant roles of cu species other than mno2 or diverse reaction mechanisms involved despite similar catalytic behaviors gao et al 6 reported that α mno2 and β mno2 had similar catalytic activity for no oxidation while the catalytic activity of α mno2 was benefit from the chemisorbed oxygen species while that of β mno2 was influenced by chemisorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen or mn cations it was noted from fig 3b that the catalytic activity of cuxmn180 composites decreased slightly with the increasing cu doping amount which might be resulted from the agglomeration or the occupation of mn sites of the excessive cu species in addition compared with cu1mn100 cu1mn180 composite exhibited higher crystallinity stabilization better sedimentation performance easy recycle characteristics and more promising prospect in practical application moreover the detailed mechanisms in o3 cu1mn180 process would be discussed and elucidated in the following section 3 2 the catalytic ozonation applicability of cu1mn180 composite the effects of cu1mn180 dosage and initial oa concentration on oa degradation in o3 cu1mn180 process were evaluated fig s2 when the cu1mn180 dosage was 200 500 and 1000 mg l 1 the degradation efficiencies of oa in 30 min were 86 7 92 2 and 85 2 respectively fig s2a the increasing dosage of catalysts could provide more active sites to promote the production of active radicals from o3 decomposition and facilitate the degradation of oa however the excessive catalyst would be aggregated and inhibit the availability of the active sites leading to the declined oa removal 19 in addition the degradation efficiencies of oa decreased from 92 2 to 67 3 with the initial oa concentration increased from 30 to 100 mg l 1 fig s2b the excessive oa would compete with the dissolved o3 for the limited surface active sites and reactive oxygen species ros further restricting the degradation of oa 26 it is notable from fig 4a that the removal efficiencies of oa via direct adsorption of cu1mn180 and o3 cu1mn180 process were 35 3 and 91 8 79 8 of toc removal rate as shown in fig s6 within 30 min which were similar with these of mn180 at ph 3 0 suggesting that the β mno2 instead of the surface cuo played a crucial role for efficient oa degradation the electrostatic attraction may take a predominant role for oa removal at ph 3 0 due to the existence of the hydrogen oxalate ion hc2o4 and the protonated surface of cu1mn180 composite phpzc 3 49 mn oh2 and or cu oh2 in solution fig s3 which could facilitate the ros generation and oa elimination during ozonation 27 29 in addition there was maximum 3 64 mg l 1 of mn2 released into the solution during the reaction fig s4 probably posing a slight improvement on oa degradation 30 besides the role of oh at ph 3 0 in o3 cu1mn180 process was identified by the addition of tba 31 in the presence of tba the removal efficiency of oa mildly declined to 81 9 indicating that oh in the bulk solution took a minor part for oa degradation in o3 cu1mn180 process furthermore po4 3 a strong lewis base has a relatively strong affinity for transition metal ions 27 with the existence of po4 3 a distinct inhibitory effect on oa removal was observed resulting in a 43 3 decline in oa removal efficiency at 10 min it s worth noting that the oa removal efficiency recovered to 92 3 within 30 min fig 4a indicating that there still existed other synergistic processes or active sites besides the surface oh groups and the lewis acid sites for the enhanced ozonation degradation of oa at ph 3 0 in o3 cu1mn180 process as depicted in fig 4b less than 2 0 of oa was removed by direct adsorption of mn180 and cu1mn180 at ph 6 0 because of the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged cu1mn180 and oxalate ion c2o4 2 noteworthily the removal efficiencies of oa were 3 2 12 5 and 87 5 79 1 of toc removal rate in fig s6 within 30 min in single ozonation o3 mn180 and o3 cu1mn180 processes respectively the results demonstrated that the presence of cu1mn180 significantly expedited the catalytic ozonation performance of oa degradation and the cu specie could be the dominant active site at ph 6 0 it was probably that the good coordination potential and multivalence properties of cu could increase the superficial active sites and promote the electron transfer of cu1mn180 besides there was a weak leakage of cu2 0 2 mg l 1 and mn2 0 3 mg l 1 after 30 min reaction of which the contributions to the catalytic ozonation could be ignored as illustrated in fig 4b the catalytic ozonation activities were drastically suppressed by the addition of tba and po4 3 and the oa removal efficiencies reduced to 12 8 and 8 5 30 min respectively representing that oh and the surface acid sites played critical roles in o3 cu1mn180 process furthermore the detection of dmpo oh adduct with the four peak intensity ratios of 1 2 2 1 confirming the production of oh in o3 cu1mn180 process fig s5 moreover the strong interference of po4 3 disclosed the role of acid sites involved in the catalytic ozonation and the formation of complexation between oa and cu specie on the catalytic surface could be a key link for efficient oa removal at ph 9 0 fig 4c the adsorption removal of oa by mn180 and cu1mn180 could be neglected 2 0 and attributed to the greater electrostatic repulsion meanwhile the removal efficiencies of oa were 33 0 14 3 and 70 3 30 min 45 4 of toc removal rate in fig s6 in single ozonation o3 mn180 and o3 cu1mn180 processes respectively the cu1mn180 showed favorable catalytic performance in basic solution environment the distinct enhancement of oa degradation during single ozonation was ascribed to the improving oh production derived from the increased decomposition rate of molecular o3 by oh 32 33 the oa removal efficiency in o3 mn180 was lower than that in single ozonation probably because the mn180 caused the ineffective decomposition of o3 34 the semblable suppression performance was achieved in o3 cu1mn180 process with the addition of tba and po4 3 signified the similar catalytic mechanisms existed at ph 6 0 and 9 0 as displayed in fig 5 among four consecutive cycles there was no distinct loss of catalytic properties the oa removal efficiency was 90 9 within 60 min after the 4th run exhibiting excellent stability and industrial application potential in catalytic ozonation the surface morphology of fresh and used cu1mn180 composites were characterized by tem and the images were shown in fig 6 the lattice fringes were clearly visible and the distance between neighboring fringes were 0 31797 nm fresh cu1mn180 and 0 31596 used cu1mn180 respectively which were consistent with the 110 facet of β mno2 35 the morphology of cu1mn180 composite hardly changed during the catalytic ozonation presenting the superb stability of the composite 3 3 reaction mechanism elucidation in o3 cu1mn180 process based on a series of characterization and oxidation experiments the feasible mechanism of the oxidation process at ph 6 0 was speculated as follows the near neutral condition ph 6 0 was closer to the ph of the practical water treatment processes which has potential and significant application prospects 3 3 1 the multivalent mn the survey spectrum and spectra of mn 3 s mn 2p3 2 o 1 s and cu 2p were illustrated in fig 7 the main constituent elements of cu1mn180 composite were mn cu and o fig 7a the average oxidation state aos of the composites could be calculated with the formula aos 8 956 1 126δes where δes means the energy difference between the splitting mn3s peaks as shown in fig 7b 9 36 the aos before and after the catalytic ozonation were 3 69 and 3 71 respectively the increment of average valence state of mn after the ozonation demonstrated the electron transfer among multivalent mn during the reaction besides the mn2p3 2 xps spectrum fig 7c was deconvoluted into three peaks with the binding energy of 643 0 or 643 1 641 8 and 640 1 ev which were attributed to mn4 mn3 and mn2 respectively 37 3 3 2 the function of structural o species for the o1s spectrum in fig 7d the peak with the binding energy of 530 7 ev was assigned as the surface adsorbed oxygen oads including o2 o and oh and another peak of 529 5 ev was denoted as the lattice oxygen olatt 38 the composition of o species on the surface of cu1mn180 was further investigated by o2 tpd analysis as illustrated in fig 8 the peaks appearing at 400 c to 650 c were due to the release of subsurface olatt while the peak emerging above 700 c was attributed to the bulk olatt 38 no obvious peaks occurred when the temperature was lower than 350 c meaning that the release of chemisorbed oxygen molecules and superficial active oxygen species were negligible confirming the extremely low impact posed by surface oh groups noteworthily the peak intensities of used cu1mn180 was higher than that of fresh cu1mn180 fig 8 and there was more olatt generated during the catalytic ozonation indicating the participation of the olatt in o3 cu1mn180 process the reciprocal conversion of multivalent metals mn4 mn3 and mn2 can produce oxygen vacancy ov to maintain the electrostatic balance which would play a crucial role in enhancive catalytic ozonation performance 24 38 the ratios of mn2 mn3 mn4 were 0 93 fresh cu1mn180 and 0 79 used cu1mn180 respectively fig 7c reflecting the higher ov content in fresh cu1mn180 composite the ov played an important role in the absorption of oxidant like o2 24 and o3 38 and the ov made olatt adjacent to the ov more active further promoting the redox properties of oxygen species 24 compared with the fresh cu1mn180 the blurred edge was distinct in used cu1mn180 marked with the red box in tem image fig 6d and the peaks of the used cu1mn180 shifted to the lower temperature in o2 tpd characterization fig 8 indicating that more defects were generated and the olatt in became more active after ozonation reaction with the involvement of ov h2o molecule could occupy the ov to form the surface oh2 eq 3 20 which further react with o3 to yield ho3 eqs 4 6 37 the o2 on the surface of cu1mn180 is released as an oxygen molecule to regenerate the ov eq 7 37 furthermore o3 molecule could also be absorbed on the surface of cu1mn180 via donating an oxygen atom o to replenish an ov whereafter the o3 could react with o2 to generate the intermediate ozone anion radical o3 eq 8 which will convert to ho3 eq 9 and then decompose to produce oh eq 10 39 3 mn ii mn iii o 3 h 2 o mn i v oh 2 o 2 o 2 4 mn i v oh 2 o 3 mn i v oh ho 3 5 mn iv

were located at the binding energy of 934 1 used cu1mn180 and 934 0 ev fresh cu1mn180 denoting the successful decoration of cuo onto the cu1mn180 surface 40 previous researches confirmed that the cuo was able to form multi dentate surface complex with oa 41 42 the py ir characterization was used to identify the b and l acid sites on the surface of the composites 43 it can be seen from fig s7 that the peak at 1605 cm 1 originated from the l acid site was observed and there was no absorption peak corresponding to the b acid site 21 44 further conforming the absence of surface oh groups the acid quantity was calculated according to eqs 1 2 and the results are listed in table 2 the l acidity of cu1mn180 was obviously decreased after the catalytic ozonation based on the tem and o2 tpd results the excellent stability of cu1mn180 composite in the cyclic experiments was ascribed to the induced defects and the active olatt during the catalytic ozonation cu as the l acid site made a huge contribution to the exceptional catalytic performance of cu1mn180 composite cu ii could complex with c2o4 2 41 42 contribute to the rearrangement of electron clouds and then accelerate the electron

catalytic ozonation as the hydrothermal temperature elevated the crystal phase of mno2 changed from α mno2 to β mno2 and the bet specific surface area continuingly descended the cu1mn180 with especially low specific surface area 3 277 m2 g 1 exhibited exceptional catalytic ozonation activity the removal efficiencies of oa were 91 8 87 5 and 70 3 at ph 3 0 6 0 and 9 0 respectively the electrostatic attraction between hc2o4 and the protonated cu1mn180 surface was the reliable explanations for efficient oa degradation at ph 3 0 in summary the promoted ozonation of oa via cu1mn180 composite is a complicated multifunctional process involving the participation of multivalent mn the structural o species and cu species in cu1mn180 composite under near neutral and alkaline

13087,in the textile industry a high efficiency dye removal is demanded to recycle wastewater in this study we decide to report the fabrication of high performance mixed matrix nanofiltration pvdf membranes mmms through the incorporation of different loading amounts of pvdf g pmma copolymer and go and go sio2 gs nanoparticles separately and in coupled with each other this copolymer was synthesized by grafting methyl methacrylate monomers onto polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf via the atom transfer radical polymerization method atrp and graphene oxide sio2 was synthesized by using the modified hummer method followed by the addition of sio2 to the as prepared go nanosheets the pvdf pvdf g pmma graphene oxide sio2 membrane with optimum properties not only resulted in a high dye rejection of above 99 for crystal violet cv and direct yellow dy dyes but also led to a remarkable enhancement in water flux from 1 96 l m2 h bar for the neat pvdf to 2 5 l m2 h bar for the optimum pvdf pvdf g pmma graphene oxide sio2 membrane owing to the addition of the hydrophilic pvdf g pmma copolymer and graphene oxide sio2 nanoparticles to the pvdf membrane matrix furthermore the durability and antifouling abilities of the optimum membrane were also investigated by which a significant performance was obtained keywords mixed matrix membrane polyvinylidene fluoride membrane atrp method amphiphilic graft copolymer go sio2 nanoparticles 1 introduction in recent decades water scarcity has proved to be a very important issue which can strongly affect people s life all around the world 1 it has been evaluated that about 40 70 of the chemical plant capital along with operating costs are related to the separation and purification approaches for water treatment 2 so far innumerable approaches have been utilized for wastewater treatment including the advanced oxidation procedure desalination route membrane separation process water reuse and ion exchange method 3 among which membrane separation processes are not only capable of providing much better performance but also able to provide the greener approaches by their bio compatibility to the environment and small footprint 4 5 water purification processes by membrane technologies including microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have recently become the center of attention in an extensive range of applications including water reclamation desalination approaches energy production processes water and wastewater treatment routes carbon dioxide capture procedures as well as energy storage 6 7 nanofiltration technology is now extensively utilized in drinking water wastewater treatment and industrial applications arising from not only low energy cost but also its simple operational process in which the properties of nf membranes are considered as the most important parameters 8 polymeric nf membranes are capable of providing many merits in the range between ro and uf leading to its versatility for separations on a molecular level 9 separation procedures conducted via nf membranes mainly takes place as a result of size exclusion and electrostatic interactions it is well known that size exclusion is the main determining factor for separation in charged and uncharged membranes 10 hence the pore structure and size along with the membrane surface characteristics are all the main features affecting transport of water and solute molecules through the membrane accordingly it is necessary to develop new membrane materials and explore facile membrane preparation routes to reach optimum features by the final nf membranes 11 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is considered as a naturally hydrophobic polymer which is commercially proposed for its outstanding properties including good membrane forming capability excellent thermal stability superb chemical resistance and considerable mechanical strength and therefore it is extensively employed for the fabrication of various mf uf nf and other membranes 12 14 due to the hydrophobic nature of pvdf the membranes prepared by this polymer are prone to fouling arising from by the accumulation of dissolved solutes on the membrane surface or blocking the pores accordingly the membrane surface provides favorable conditions for serious fouling against solutions including accumulation deposition and adsorption of organic inorganic and biological foulants including proteins suspended solids natural organic matters dye molecules microorganisms etc on the membrane surface or within membrane pores hence it is vital to improve the hydrophilicity of these membranes by the addition of different additives for the purpose of reducing the above mentioned issue 15 in recent decades innumerable studies have been conducted on improving the hydrophobic nature of pvdf membranes through chemical and physical modification routs 16 17 based on the literature the chemical modification routs lead to several changes in the pvdf backbone structure providing several advantages in the final membranes 18 also physical modification routs specially mixing with inorganic nps have also proven to be very efficient for enhancing the hydrophilicity of pvdf membranes 19 20 for instance du et al prepared pvdf polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp and titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles blend membranes through an electrostatic spinning by which the membrane hydrophilicity was significantly enhanced 21 the incorporation of nanoparticles into membrane matrixes is a promising route for improving their antifouling property arising from the straightforward processing along with the predictable separation performance 22 according to the literature nanoparticles including tio2 23 24 sio2 25 al2o3 26 27 and carbon nanotubes 28 have been widely utilized for this purpose nevertheless not only the poor dispersibility but also the complete encapsulation via the polymer matrix is regarded as the two main drawbacks in the utilization of nanoparticles considerably deteriorating the modification efficiency 29 graphene oxide go is promising candidate for modification of polymeric membranes arising from its large surface area as well as great charge carrier mobility 30 31 nevertheless go nanosheets suffer from restacking decreasing their surface area and deteriorating their properties hence it has been reported in the literature that the immobilization of nanoparticles on go nanosheets can avoid their restacking enhancing their efficiency in different applications 32 33 it is also noteworthy that the large surface area and the numerous oxygen containing functional groups present in go make it as a superb platform for anchoring different nanoparticles by which agglomeration can be also minimized 31 additionally blending hydrophilic polymers e g pvp 34 35 polyethylene glycol peg 36 37 polyvinyl alcohol pva 38 is also another approach for improving the hydrophilicity and antifouling performance nonetheless the above mentioned polymers are water soluble and therefore they would be washed out of the membrane matrix throughout the membrane formation and subsequent operation 29 hence amphiphilic copolymers comprised of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties have attracted many interests 39 the presence of the hydrophobic chains results in a good compatibility with pvdf chains and the hydrophilic moieties can give a considerable coverage of hydrated side chains which are anchored via a hydrophobic backbone enhancing the antifouling performance 40 in this research work mixed matrix nanofiltration pvdf membranes mmms with outstanding properties were fabricated through the incorporation of different loading amounts of the prepared pvdf g pmma copolymer and go and go sio2 gs nanoparticles separately and in coupled with each other the atrp process was employed for the preparation of the copolymer through grafting methyl methacrylate monomers onto the pvdf backbone furthermore the modified hummer method was also utilized for the synthesis of graphene oxide nanosheets then the as prepared go nanosheets were loaded with sio2 nanoparticles to prevent restacking of go nanoparticles avoid sio2 nanoparticles agglomeration and prepare a new nanoparticle with high hydrophilicity so that a superior performance could be achieved furthermore it is worth mentioning that the prepared copolymer and gs nanoparticles were both incorporated in membranes matrix to reach an outstanding by their synergistic effect it was found that the pvdf pvdf g pmma graphene oxide sio2 membrane with optimum properties was able to provide a high dye rejection good water flux excellent durability and superb antifouling abilities in comparison with the neat pvdf one 2 experimental 2 1 materials pvdf mw 145 000 was obtained from basf cucl cucl2 99 999 n n n n n pentamethyl diethylenetriamine amine 98 n n dimethylacetamide n methyl 2 pyrrolidone sulphuric acid h2so4 98 and phosphoric acid h3po4 99 were purchased from merck nitric acid hno3 65 wt potassium permanganate kmno4 99 natural graphite powder 20 mm with purity 99 85 wt bovine serum albumin bsa mn 68 000 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane aptes 97 crystal violet direct yellow and 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl dimethyl 3 sulfopropyl ammonium hydroxide msa 97 were obtained from sigma aldrich hydrochloric acid hcl 36 wt n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 9 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 wt were obtained from pubchem 2 2 copolymer synthesis pvdf g pmma copolymer was fabricated through the atrp method scheme 1 in which pvdf was the main backbone accordingly 5 g of pvdf was first dissolved in dmac nmp 4 1 in a 100 ml three neck flask at 50 c in the next step 0 05 g 0 5 mmol of cucl 0 08 g 0 5 mmol of pmdeta and 4 48 mg of cucl2 were introduced to the above mentioned solution subsequently the reaction flask was placed in an oil bath at the temperature of 90 c for 1 day under nitrogen atmosphere the copolymer was prepared as a diluted dark brown solution with thf and precipitated in methanol eventually the fabricated solid was purified three times followed via drying in a vacuum oven set at 60 c overnight 2 3 go synthesis here the improved hummer s route was utilized for the fabrication of go nanosheets based on this method 41 natural graphite powder is employed as the source material it is worth pointing out that by using this method the use of nano3 as the reactant is eliminated and also the volume percentage ratio of h2so4 h3po4 increases to 9 1 for environmental decontamination purposes accordingly 1 g of graphite was added into 200 ml of the above mentioned concentrated acids mixture under constant stirring because of exothermic conditions 30 35 c it is required to conduct this reaction in an ice bath subsequently 6 g of kmno4 was introduced mildly into the as prepared mixture followed via stirring for 3 days while the reaction container was placed in an oil bath set at the temperature of 40 50 c it was observed that the color of the reaction mixture was gradually changed from dark black to brown in the next step the reaction mixture was transferred into 400 ml of ice bath to form a dark red solution moreover the color of the reaction mixture was then changed to bright yellow after the drop wise addition of h2o2 to the solution finally the prepared graphene oxide first washed twice with a 1 1 1 solution of absolute ethanol deionized water and hcl respectively and then centrifuged and washed several times with di water to adjust ph of the solution to 4 5 additionally it is noteworthy that it is preferable to utilize ultrasonic homogenizer for exfoliation of the prepared go nanosheets eventually the final product was separated by freeze drying and centrifugation 2 4 go sio2 synthesis go sio2 nanoparticles were fabricated via the kou strategy 42 conducted via the in situ hydrolysis of teos as the precursor for this purpose 37 5 mg of go nanosheets powder was first dispersed completely in 450 ml of an ethanol water solution 5 1 v v by using a probe high power ultrasonic device for 2 h and subsequently the solution ph was adjusted to 8 5 9 with an as prepared ammonia solution after the addition of 1 8 ml of teos the mixture was sonicated for 2 h in order to obtain the go sio2 nanoparticles the solution was centrifuged and washed twice with ethyl alcohol and it finally dried eventually the final product was transferred to a freeze dryer instrument and kept until conducting the membrane fabrication 2 5 preparation of the pvdf pvdf g pmma go sio2 and pvdf pvdf g pmma go mixed matrix membranes for the fabrication of both the modified pvdf pvdf g pmma go and pvdf pvdf g pmma go sio2 mixed matrix membranes a non solvent induced phase separation nips method was utilized accordingly a certain amount of the as fabricated go and go sio2 nanoparticles with a weight percentage of 0 05 wt was dissolved in a mixture of dmac dmso solvents with the ratio of 70 30 followed via sonication for 90 min subsequently a certain amount of the as prepared pvdf g pmma copolymer with a weight percentage of 0 05 wt was also added to the above mentioned solution followed by sonicating for another 90 min in the next step a certain amount of pvdf with a weight percentage of 19 wt was added to the mixture followed by stirring at 65 c for 1 day until a homogeneous solution was obtained then after vacuuming the solution and wholly eliminating the trapped bubbles the above mentioned mixture solution was cast on a glass substrate by using a dr blade device thickness of about 250 μm and immersed in a water coagulation bath at 15 c in the final step the prepared membranes were stored in di water for removing the residual solvent molecules trapped in the membrane pores the details related to the experimental conditions are listed in table 1 2 6 filtration experiment here water flux and dye rejection were investigated by a dead end cell accordingly a feed including a 25 ppm dye solution in di water was added to the cell and pushed to permeate through the fabricated membrane under the pressure of 7 bar afterwards data were measured through the following equations 1 f v a t 2 r c f c p c f 100 where f is ascribed to flux l m2 h v is related to the collected volume l a is the effective surface area m2 and t is related to the collecting time h r is ascribed to the rejection cf and cp are related to the feed and permeate solution concentration measured via uv vis spectrophotometer uv 5100 china it is worth pointing out that after initial flux measurements the membranes were washed with distilled water for 1 h and then the operation was continued 3 results and discussion 3 1 copolymer characterization elemental studies the 1h nmr spectra corresponding to the pvdf homopolymer and the pvdf g pmma copolymer are represented in fig 1 accordingly it is easily discernible that the peaks appeared at 2 25 ppm a hh and 2 88 ppm a ht in both the homopolymer and copolymer spectra correspond to the ch2 group in head to head and head to tail structures respectively in the pvdf backbone based on fig 1b the peak which has emerged at 3 60 ppm b corresponds to the och3 group existing on the side chain of pmma which firmly confirms the accomplishment of pmma grafting from the pvdf backbone also it should be mentioned that the two strong peaks which have been emerged at 2 49 s1 and 3 29 ppm s2 correspond to dmso and h2o solvents respectively fig s1 shows the ft ir spectra corresponding to the pvdf homopolymer and the pvdf g pmma copolymer based on which it can be easily observed that the strong peak appeared at 1729 cm 1 in the spectrum related to the copolymer which is ascribed to the co group in pmma is the main difference of these spectra strongly confirming the accomplishment of the grafting step additionally it can be seen that a sharp peak has also emerged at 2868 cm 1 in the copolymer spectrum corresponding to the och3 group in pmma which is another evidence for the successful grafting step 43 for the purpose of evaluating the thermal stability of the fabricated pvdf homopolymer and the pvdf g pmma copolymer tga analysis was performed at a heating rate of 15 c min in the range between 25 and 600 c under purging nitrogen gas it is evident in fig 2a that a thermal decomposition has occurred at the temperature of 478 89 c for the unmodified pvdf homopolymer while there are two thermal decomposition steps in the spectrum related to the copolymer fig 2b in which the first one corresponds to the pmma decomposition located at 396 41 c and the second decomposition is ascribed to the pvdf decomposition emerged at 491 21 c 44 moreover it is also noteworthy that the decomposition step emerged before 250 c is ascribed to the solvent or h2o elimination 3 2 nanoparticles characterization elemental studies fig 3 exhibits the ftir spectra of go and go sio2 nanoparticles the broad peak emerged at 3000 3750 cm 1 in both spectra corresponds to oh groups present in both go and go sio2 nanoparticles characteristic peaks of go have emerged at 1635 and 1730 cm 1 related to cc and co stretching vibrations respectively moreover ch and co stretching vibrations have appeared at 1037 and 1091 cm 1 respectively it is clear that after conducting the reaction with teos for the fabrication of go sio2 nanoparticles the intensity of the co peak present at 1730 cm 1 has decreased arising from the conversion of some co groups to cosi ones by drawing a comparison between the spectra of go and go sio2 nanoparticles it can be discerned that several new peaks have also emerged at 1091 950 and 805 cm 1 which are related to siosi asymmetric vibration sioh stretching vibration and siosi symmetric vibration respectively 45 fig 4 exhibits the xrd diffraction peaks of go and go sio2 nanoparticles as can be seen in the pattern related to go the intense peak emerged at about 2θ 10 88 is related to the crystalline stack and smooth structure of go 46 because of the transition between the go crystalline structure and the semi crystalline one in go sio2 nanoparticles the intense distinctive peak of go has shifted towards 2θ 12 02 in the go sio2 pattern furthermore the broad peak appeared at 2θ 19 6 is also ascribed to the amorphous structure of sio2 which has overlapped with the go characteristic peak 47 the raman spectra of go and go sio2 nanoparticles are depicted in fig 5 it is well known that go shows two distinctive peaks at about 1342 cm 1 d band and 1599 cm 1 g band which are obvious in this figure the g band is generally ascribed to sp2 stretching of double bonded atoms cc arising from the graphite structure the d peak is also related to the disorders generated via the sp3 carbon structure originating from the go functional groups additionally the 2d peak is considered as the overton or the second order harmonic of the d peak usually emerged at 1708 cm 1 46 48 it is noteworthy that the i2d ig ratio is ascribed to the number of layers in the crystalline go framework accordingly after the evaluation of the exact position intensity of the 2d peak it is confirmed that the i2d ig ratio of go sio2 has been considerably enhanced when compared to go leading to the higher tendency of go sio2 nanoparticles to double layer sheets indeed through loading the sio2 nanoparticles into the go layers a superior exfoliation of these layers can be achieved resulting in the fabrication of double layer nanoparticles furthermore it is known that the intensity ratio of d to g id ig is a measure of the disorders percentage in the sp3 structure 48 evaluated to be 92 and 98 for go and go sio2 nanoparticles respectively additionally it is also worth pointing out that the id ig ratio reflects the crystalline order of the carbon based materials 49 accordingly due to the fact that the id ig ratio of go sio2 is higher than that of go it possesses a more defective lattice also the presence of the amorphous sio2 nanoparticles in the crystalline structure of go lead to more disorders in the hybrid nanoparticles 3 3 membranes characterization elemental studies the elemental analysis was conducted via edx analysis to investigate the elemental composition of the prepared membranes as depicted in fig s3 as exhibited in fig s3a the neat pvdf membrane is only composed of c and f elements while after the addition of the copolymer and go nanosheets as shown in fig s2b c and e respectively the o element is also observed in the composition demonstrating their successful incorporation furthermore along with the o element the si element can be easily discerned in fig s2d f h by which the incorporation of go sio2 into the gs 0 3 co gs 0 15 co gs 0 3 and co gs 0 45 membrane samples can be strongly demonstrated fig 6 exhibits the ft ir spectra of all the fabricated membranes it is obvious in all the spectra that the peaks related to the pvdf backbone have emerged at 1399 1176 and 1068 cm 1 which are ascribed to the ch2 cf2 and cc stretching vibrations in addition the peaks emerged at 1277 878 and 838 cm 1 also correspond to the vibration bands of the β phase moreover the peak evident at 763 cm 1 is also related to the vibration of the pvdf α phase 50 by drawing a comparison between the spectra of the neat pvdf membrane and those containing the pvdf g pmma copolymer it can be discerned that the most important difference is the strong peak appeared at 1736 cm 1 in the spectra of those containing pvdf g pmma which is related to the co group in pmma 34 36 also the characteristic peaks of go in the spectra of the membranes with go and gs nanoparticles have emerged at 1636 and 1727 cm 1 which are ascribed to the cc and co stretching vibrations respectively furthermore in comparison with go the new peaks appeared at 799 959 and 1078 cm 1 in the spectra of the membranes with gs which are related to the siosi symmetric vibration sioh stretching vibration and siosi asymmetric stretching vibration respectively demonstrate the successful incorporation of go sio2 nanoparticles into the pvdf membranes 51 the xrd diffraction peaks of go and go sio2 nanoparticles are exhibited in fig 4 and the xrd diffraction peaks of the prepared membranes are exhibited in fig 7 by drawing a comparison between these two figures it can be discerned that the peaks related to go and go sio2 nanoparticles have overlapped with those of the pvdf backbone the peaks emerged at 18 40 25 3 36 79 and 40 6 correspond to the α phase pvdf while the peak appeared at 20 49 is related to the β phase pvdf although the peaks related to the nanoparticles are not evident the integral area of the peaks emerged at 18 40 and 20 49 have clearly decreased through the incorporation of go copolymer and go sio2 arising from the reduction of pvdf crystallinity it is obvious that the more nanoparticles have been added and the more agglomerations have been formed the more crystallinity has decreased 50 3 4 membranes characterization morphological studies figs 8 and s2 shows the cross sectional fesem images of the fabricated membranes in which the asymmetric open cellular spongy structure with finger like cavities are obvious in all the membranes cross section 9 according to the literature the size of the finger like cavities is related to a balance between the velocity of water molecules as the non solvent that enter the polymer solution and the velocity of the solvent molecules that leave the polymer solution the incorporation of both the copolymer and nanoparticles can considerably enhance the hydrophilic nature of the membrane leading to a faster transport of water molecules into the polymer solution and therefore formation of larger cavities 52 53 all the aforementioned findings are easily discernible in fig 8 by drawing a comparison between the neat membrane morphology and that of other mmms fig 9 shows the surface fesem images of all the prepared membranes on which the incorporated nanoparticles and copolymer are easily discerned according to scheme 2 the incorporation of both the nanoparticles and the copolymer coupled with each other leads to a much better dispersion of nanoparticles and negligible agglomerations hence the go 0 3 and gs 0 3 show a higher agglomerations than the coupled ones moreover it can be found that the more the loading amount has increased the more agglomeration has also increased accordingly although the co go 0 15 and co go 0 3 membranes exhibit no agglomerations by increasing the nanoparticles content some agglomerations have been formed on the surface of the co go 0 45 sample which leads to deterioration in the membrane performance 13 bet analysis was also conducted on the neat pvdf membrane and the co gs 0 3 membrane as the optimum sample to investigate the nanoparticles effect on the pores characteristics of the membrane accordingly it can be seen that through the incorporation of the co gs nanoparticles pore size has decreased from 35 nm for the neat membrane to 25 3 nm for the co gs 0 3 membrane furthermore the bet surface area has also increased from 4 07 m2 g for the neat membrane to 6 21 m2 g for the co gs 0 3 membrane all these findings demonstrate that although cavities have enlarged in the modified membranes cross section based on the fesem results the overall pore size distribution has decreased after the incorporation of nanoparticles especially the surface pore sizes leading to a much better rejection performance fesem mapping analysis was utilized as an effective tool for investigating the elements dispersion in the prepared co gs 0 3 membrane according to fig s4 all the elements are obvious and their good dispersion throughout the membrane surface can be demonstrated by which the formation of the efficient co gs 0 3 membrane can be confirmed afm analysis was also conducted to evaluate the roughness parameters of the fabricated membranes surface as exhibited in fig 10 and table s1 it is obvious that the addition of the prepared copolymer fig 10a b has negligibly increased the roughness of the neat membrane moreover the addition of the nanoparticles fig 10c d has considerably increased the membrane surface roughness arising from their agglomerations on the surface on the other hands although the incorporation of both nanoparticles and the copolymer fig 10e f has increased the membrane surface roughness the roughness is lower than that of the membranes with only nanoparticles maybe arising from their lower agglomerations as shown in scheme 2 3 5 membranes characterization hydrophilicity studies contact angle analysis was conducted for all the prepared samples to evaluate the effect of the prepared copolymer and nanoparticles on the hydrophilic nature of the membranes the less the contact angle the more the hydrophilic nature 54 55 as can be seen in fig 11 by the addition of the copolymer and nanoparticles into the membranes matrix hydrophilicity has increased arising from their high hydrophilic nature furthermore the hydrophilicity of the membranes incorporated with go and gs is better than that of the copolymer incorporated membrane arising from the higher hydrophilicity of nanoparticles when compared to the prepared copolymer additionally it was found that the hydrophilic nature can be enhanced more as a result of the synergistic effect if both the copolymer and nanoparticles are incorporated into the membrane matrix it can be attributed to the good dispersion of nanoparticles without any agglomerations due to the interactions with the copolymer in the membrane matrix 56 3 6 membranes characterization separation performance to investigate the separation performance of the prepared membranes their flux and dyes rejection for direct yellow and crystal violet were evaluated via the self made cell under the pressure of 7 bar according to fig 12 the membranes flux has been considerably enhanced after the addition of the copolymer go and gs nanoparticles separately or in a coupled way when compared to the neat pvdf membrane it is well known that go nanosheets act as porous nanoparticles providing an additional channel for permeation of water molecules 57 graphene and its derivatives are capable of providing a clear molecular cutoff along with considerable selectivity because of their well arranged laminar structure as well as the well defined interlayer space 8 furthermore it has been demonstrated in the literature that through the narrow interspace existing between the go sheets 58 an ultrafast transport of water and other solvents can be provided resulting in a significant permeate flux 59 furthermore the nanoparticles and copolymer can enhance the hydrophilic nature of the mmms leading to a higher flux 52 moreover it can be discerned that the incorporation of gs has a higher impact on enhancing flux arising from the more hydrophilic functional groups provided via sio2 nanoparticles the rejection performance of the modified membranes was also enhanced in comparison to the neat one it was found that the incorporation of both the copolymer and nanoparticles could provide a synergistic effect by which a higher rejection ability could be obtained when compared to the membranes with only nanoparticles or the copolymer the highest rejection performance was obtained by the co gs 0 3 sample which could reject 99 8 of dy and 99 5 of cv dye molecules 3 6 1 permeate flux versus time fluxes of the c0 and co gs 0 3 membranes versus time are displayed in fig s5 in which it can be easily seen that the prepared co gs 0 3 membrane possesses a better antifouling performance as a result of introducing both the copolymer and go sio2 nanoparticles which has resulted in no significant changes in the flux performance through time the above mentioned findings are probably due to the effect of the added copolymer and go sio2 nanoparticles in enhancing water permeability 9 3 6 2 long term durability according to fig s6 for the purpose of evaluating the durability of the co gs 0 3 membrane in a long run its flux and dye rejection capability were investigated through running the experiments for ten consecutive days 9 accordingly the obtained results demonstrated that the fabricated co gs 0 3 membrane could provide a superb ability in the rejection of the dy and cv dyes for long periods it was proved that no significant changes was occurred in the dye rejection after

13087,in the textile industry a high efficiency dye removal is demanded to recycle wastewater in this study we decide to report the fabrication of high performance mixed matrix nanofiltration pvdf membranes mmms through the incorporation of different loading amounts of pvdf g pmma copolymer and go and go sio2 gs nanoparticles separately and in coupled with each other this copolymer was synthesized by grafting methyl methacrylate monomers onto polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf via the atom transfer radical polymerization method atrp and graphene oxide sio2 was synthesized by using the modified hummer method followed by the addition of sio2 to the as prepared go nanosheets the pvdf pvdf g pmma graphene oxide sio2 membrane with optimum properties not only resulted in a high dye rejection of above 99 for crystal violet cv and direct yellow dy dyes but also led to a remarkable enhancement in water flux from 1 96 l m2 h bar for the neat pvdf to 2 5 l m2 h bar for the optimum pvdf pvdf g pmma graphene oxide sio2 membrane owing to the addition of the hydrophilic pvdf g pmma copolymer and graphene oxide sio2 nanoparticles to the pvdf membrane matrix furthermore the durability and antifouling abilities of the optimum membrane were also investigated by which a significant performance was obtained keywords mixed matrix membrane polyvinylidene fluoride membrane atrp method amphiphilic graft copolymer go sio2 nanoparticles 1 introduction in recent decades water scarcity has proved to be a very important issue which can strongly affect people s life all around the world 1 it has been evaluated that about 40 70 of the chemical plant capital along with operating costs are related to the separation and purification approaches for water treatment 2 so far innumerable approaches have been utilized for wastewater treatment including the advanced oxidation procedure desalination route membrane separation process water reuse and ion exchange method 3 among which membrane separation processes are not only capable of providing much better performance but also able to provide the greener approaches by their bio compatibility to the environment and small footprint 4 5 water purification processes by membrane technologies including microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have recently become the center of attention in an extensive range of applications including water reclamation desalination approaches energy production processes water and wastewater treatment routes carbon dioxide capture procedures as well as energy storage 6 7 nanofiltration technology is now extensively utilized in drinking water wastewater treatment and industrial applications arising from not only low energy cost but also its simple operational process in which the properties of nf membranes are considered as the most important parameters 8 polymeric nf membranes are capable of providing many merits in the range between ro and uf leading to its versatility for separations on a molecular level 9 separation procedures conducted via nf membranes mainly takes place as a result of size exclusion and electrostatic interactions it is well known that size exclusion is the main determining factor for separation in charged and uncharged membranes 10 hence the pore structure and size along with the membrane surface characteristics are all the main features affecting transport of water and solute molecules through the membrane accordingly it is necessary to develop new membrane materials and explore facile membrane preparation routes to reach optimum features by the final nf membranes 11 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is considered as a naturally hydrophobic polymer which is commercially proposed for its outstanding properties including good membrane forming capability excellent thermal stability superb chemical resistance and considerable mechanical strength and therefore it is extensively employed for the fabrication of various mf uf nf and other membranes 12 14 due to the hydrophobic nature of pvdf the membranes prepared by this polymer are prone to fouling arising from by the accumulation of dissolved solutes on the membrane surface or blocking the pores accordingly the membrane surface provides favorable conditions for serious fouling against solutions including accumulation deposition and adsorption of organic inorganic and biological foulants including proteins suspended solids natural organic matters dye molecules microorganisms etc on the membrane surface or within membrane pores hence it is vital to improve the hydrophilicity of these membranes by the addition of different additives for the purpose of reducing the above mentioned issue 15 in recent decades innumerable studies have been conducted on improving the hydrophobic nature of pvdf membranes through chemical and physical modification routs 16 17 based on the literature the chemical modification routs lead to several changes in the pvdf backbone structure providing several advantages in the final membranes 18 also physical modification routs specially mixing with inorganic nps have also proven to be very efficient for enhancing the hydrophilicity of pvdf membranes 19 20 for instance du et al prepared pvdf polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp and titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles blend membranes through an electrostatic spinning by which the membrane hydrophilicity was significantly enhanced 21 the incorporation of nanoparticles into membrane matrixes is a promising route for improving their antifouling property arising from the straightforward processing along with the predictable separation performance 22 according to the literature nanoparticles including tio2 23 24 sio2 25 al2o3 26 27 and carbon nanotubes 28 have been widely utilized for this purpose nevertheless not only the poor dispersibility but also the complete encapsulation via the polymer matrix is regarded as the two main drawbacks in the utilization of nanoparticles considerably deteriorating the modification efficiency 29 graphene oxide go is promising candidate for modification of polymeric membranes arising from its large surface area as well as great charge carrier mobility 30 31 nevertheless go nanosheets suffer from restacking decreasing their surface area and deteriorating their properties hence it has been reported in the literature that the immobilization of nanoparticles on go nanosheets can avoid their restacking enhancing their efficiency in different applications 32 33 it is also noteworthy that the large surface area and the numerous oxygen containing functional groups present in go make it as a superb platform for anchoring different nanoparticles by which agglomeration can be also minimized 31 additionally blending hydrophilic polymers e g pvp 34 35 polyethylene glycol peg 36 37 polyvinyl alcohol pva 38 is also another approach for improving the hydrophilicity and antifouling performance nonetheless the above mentioned polymers are water soluble and therefore they would be washed out of the membrane matrix throughout the membrane formation and subsequent operation 29 hence amphiphilic copolymers comprised of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties have attracted many interests 39 the presence of the hydrophobic chains results in a good compatibility with pvdf chains and the hydrophilic moieties can give a considerable coverage of hydrated side chains which are anchored via a hydrophobic backbone enhancing the antifouling performance 40 in this research work mixed matrix nanofiltration pvdf membranes mmms with outstanding properties were fabricated through the incorporation of different loading amounts of the prepared pvdf g pmma copolymer and go and go sio2 gs nanoparticles separately and in coupled with each other the atrp process was employed for the preparation of the copolymer through grafting methyl methacrylate monomers onto the pvdf backbone furthermore the modified hummer method was also utilized for the synthesis of graphene oxide nanosheets then the as prepared go nanosheets were loaded with sio2 nanoparticles to prevent restacking of go nanoparticles avoid sio2 nanoparticles agglomeration and prepare a new nanoparticle with high hydrophilicity so that a superior performance could be achieved furthermore it is worth mentioning that the prepared copolymer and gs nanoparticles were both incorporated in membranes matrix to reach an outstanding by their synergistic effect it was found that the pvdf pvdf g pmma graphene oxide sio2 membrane with optimum properties was able to provide a high dye rejection good water flux excellent durability and superb antifouling abilities in comparison with the neat pvdf one 2 experimental 2 1 materials pvdf mw 145 000 was obtained from basf cucl cucl2 99 999 n n n n n pentamethyl diethylenetriamine amine 98 n n dimethylacetamide n methyl 2 pyrrolidone sulphuric acid h2so4 98 and phosphoric acid h3po4 99 were purchased from merck nitric acid hno3 65 wt potassium permanganate kmno4 99 natural graphite powder 20 mm with purity 99 85 wt bovine serum albumin bsa mn 68 000 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane aptes 97 crystal violet direct yellow and 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl dimethyl 3 sulfopropyl ammonium hydroxide msa 97 were obtained from sigma aldrich hydrochloric acid hcl 36 wt n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 9 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 wt were obtained from pubchem 2 2 copolymer synthesis pvdf g pmma copolymer was fabricated through the atrp method scheme 1 in which pvdf was the main backbone accordingly 5 g of pvdf was first dissolved in dmac nmp 4 1 in a 100 ml three neck flask at 50 c in the next step 0 05 g 0 5 mmol of cucl 0 08 g 0 5 mmol of pmdeta and 4 48 mg of cucl2 were introduced to the above mentioned solution subsequently the reaction flask was placed in an oil bath at the temperature of 90 c for 1 day under nitrogen atmosphere the copolymer was prepared as a diluted dark brown solution with thf and precipitated in methanol eventually the fabricated solid was purified three times followed via drying in a vacuum oven set at 60 c overnight 2 3 go synthesis here the improved hummer s route was utilized for the fabrication of go nanosheets based on this method 41 natural graphite powder is employed as the source material it is worth pointing out that by using this method the use of nano3 as the reactant is eliminated and also the volume percentage ratio of h2so4 h3po4 increases to 9 1 for environmental decontamination purposes accordingly 1 g of graphite was added into 200 ml of the above mentioned concentrated acids mixture under constant stirring because of exothermic conditions 30 35 c it is required to conduct this reaction in an ice bath subsequently 6 g of kmno4 was introduced mildly into the as prepared mixture followed via stirring for 3 days while the reaction container was placed in an oil bath set at the temperature of 40 50 c it was observed that the color of the reaction mixture was gradually changed from dark black to brown in the next step the reaction mixture was transferred into 400 ml of ice bath to form a dark red solution moreover the color of the reaction mixture was then changed to bright yellow after the drop wise addition of h2o2 to the solution finally the prepared graphene oxide first washed twice with a 1 1 1 solution of absolute ethanol deionized water and hcl respectively and then centrifuged and washed several times with di water to adjust ph of the solution to 4 5 additionally it is noteworthy that it is preferable to utilize ultrasonic homogenizer for exfoliation of the prepared go nanosheets eventually the final product was separated by freeze drying and centrifugation 2 4 go sio2 synthesis go sio2 nanoparticles were fabricated via the kou strategy 42 conducted via the in situ hydrolysis of teos as the precursor for this purpose 37 5 mg of go nanosheets powder was first dispersed completely in 450 ml of an ethanol water solution 5 1 v v by using a probe high power ultrasonic device for 2 h and subsequently the solution ph was adjusted to 8 5 9 with an as prepared ammonia solution after the addition of 1 8 ml of teos the mixture was sonicated for 2 h in order to obtain the go sio2 nanoparticles the solution was centrifuged and washed twice with ethyl alcohol and it finally dried eventually the final product was transferred to a freeze dryer instrument and kept until conducting the membrane fabrication 2 5 preparation of the pvdf pvdf g pmma go sio2 and pvdf pvdf g pmma go mixed matrix membranes for the fabrication of both the modified pvdf pvdf g pmma go and pvdf pvdf g pmma go sio2 mixed matrix membranes a non solvent induced phase separation nips method was utilized accordingly a certain amount of the as fabricated go and go sio2 nanoparticles with a weight percentage of 0 05 wt was dissolved in a mixture of dmac dmso solvents with the ratio of 70 30 followed via sonication for 90 min subsequently a certain amount of the as prepared pvdf g pmma copolymer with a weight percentage of 0 05 wt was also added to the above mentioned solution followed by sonicating for another 90 min in the next step a certain amount of pvdf with a weight percentage of 19 wt was added to the mixture followed by stirring at 65 c for 1 day until a homogeneous solution was obtained then after vacuuming the solution and wholly eliminating the trapped bubbles the above mentioned mixture solution was cast on a glass substrate by using a dr blade device thickness of about 250 μm and immersed in a water coagulation bath at 15 c in the final step the prepared membranes were stored in di water for removing the residual solvent molecules trapped in the membrane pores the details related to the experimental conditions are listed in table 1 2 6 filtration experiment here water flux and dye rejection were investigated by a dead end cell accordingly a feed including a 25 ppm dye solution in di water was added to the cell and pushed to permeate through the fabricated membrane under the pressure of 7 bar afterwards data were measured through the following equations 1 f v a t 2 r c f c p c f 100 where f is ascribed to flux l m2 h v is related to the collected volume l a is the effective surface area m2 and t is related to the collecting time h r is ascribed to the rejection cf and cp are related to the feed and permeate solution concentration measured via uv vis spectrophotometer uv 5100 china it is worth pointing out that after initial flux measurements the membranes were washed with distilled water for 1 h and then the operation was continued 3 results and discussion 3 1 copolymer characterization elemental studies the 1h nmr spectra corresponding to the pvdf homopolymer and the pvdf g pmma copolymer are represented in fig 1 accordingly it is easily discernible that the peaks appeared at 2 25 ppm a hh and 2 88 ppm a ht in both the homopolymer and copolymer spectra correspond to the ch2 group in head to head and head to tail structures respectively in the pvdf backbone based on fig 1b the peak which has emerged at 3 60 ppm b corresponds to the och3 group existing on the side chain of pmma which firmly confirms the accomplishment of pmma grafting from the pvdf backbone also it should be mentioned that the two strong peaks which have been emerged at 2 49 s1 and 3 29 ppm s2 correspond to dmso and h2o solvents respectively fig s1 shows the ft ir spectra corresponding to the pvdf homopolymer and the pvdf g pmma copolymer based on which it can be easily observed that the strong peak appeared at 1729 cm 1 in the spectrum related to the copolymer which is ascribed to the co group in pmma is the main difference of these spectra strongly confirming the accomplishment of the grafting step additionally it can be seen that a sharp peak has also emerged at 2868 cm 1 in the copolymer spectrum corresponding to the och3 group in pmma which is another evidence for the successful grafting step 43 for the purpose of evaluating the thermal stability of the fabricated pvdf homopolymer and the pvdf g pmma copolymer tga analysis was performed at a heating rate of 15 c min in the range between 25 and 600 c under purging nitrogen gas it is evident in fig 2a that a thermal decomposition has occurred at the temperature of 478 89 c for the unmodified pvdf homopolymer while there are two thermal decomposition steps in the spectrum related to the copolymer fig 2b in which the first one corresponds to the pmma decomposition located at 396 41 c and the second decomposition is ascribed to the pvdf decomposition emerged at 491 21 c 44 moreover it is also noteworthy that the decomposition step emerged before 250 c is ascribed to the solvent or h2o elimination 3 2 nanoparticles characterization elemental studies fig 3 exhibits the ftir spectra of go and go sio2 nanoparticles the broad peak emerged at 3000 3750 cm 1 in both spectra corresponds to oh groups present in both go and go sio2 nanoparticles characteristic peaks of go have emerged at 1635 and 1730 cm 1 related to cc and co stretching vibrations respectively moreover ch and co stretching vibrations have appeared at 1037 and 1091 cm 1 respectively it is clear that after conducting the reaction with teos for the fabrication of go sio2 nanoparticles the intensity of the co peak present at 1730 cm 1 has decreased arising from the conversion of some co groups to cosi ones by drawing a comparison between the spectra of go and go sio2 nanoparticles it can be discerned that several new peaks have also emerged at 1091 950 and 805 cm 1 which are related to siosi asymmetric vibration sioh stretching vibration and siosi symmetric vibration respectively 45 fig 4 exhibits the xrd diffraction peaks of go and go sio2 nanoparticles as can be seen in the pattern related to go the intense peak emerged at about 2θ 10 88 is related to the crystalline stack and smooth structure of go 46 because of the transition between the go crystalline structure and the semi crystalline one in go sio2 nanoparticles the intense distinctive peak of go has shifted towards 2θ 12 02 in the go sio2 pattern furthermore the broad peak appeared at 2θ 19 6 is also ascribed to the amorphous structure of sio2 which has overlapped with the go characteristic peak 47 the raman spectra of go and go sio2 nanoparticles are depicted in fig 5 it is well known that go shows two distinctive peaks at about 1342 cm 1 d band and 1599 cm 1 g band which are obvious in this figure the g band is generally ascribed to sp2 stretching of double bonded atoms cc arising from the graphite structure the d peak is also related to the disorders generated via the sp3 carbon structure originating from the go functional groups additionally the 2d peak is considered as the overton or the second order harmonic of the d peak usually emerged at 1708 cm 1 46 48 it is noteworthy that the i2d ig ratio is ascribed to the number of layers in the crystalline go framework accordingly after the evaluation of the exact position intensity of the 2d peak it is confirmed that the i2d ig ratio of go sio2 has been considerably enhanced when compared to go leading to the higher tendency of go sio2 nanoparticles to double layer sheets indeed through loading the sio2 nanoparticles into the go layers a superior exfoliation of these layers can be achieved resulting in the fabrication of double layer nanoparticles furthermore it is known that the intensity ratio of d to g id ig is a measure of the disorders percentage in the sp3 structure 48 evaluated to be 92 and 98 for go and go sio2 nanoparticles respectively additionally it is also worth pointing out that the id ig ratio reflects the crystalline order of the carbon based materials 49 accordingly due to the fact that the id ig ratio of go sio2 is higher than that of go it possesses a more defective lattice also the presence of the amorphous sio2 nanoparticles in the crystalline structure of go lead to more disorders in the hybrid nanoparticles 3 3 membranes characterization elemental studies the elemental analysis was conducted via edx analysis to investigate the elemental composition of the prepared membranes as depicted in fig s3 as exhibited in fig s3a the neat pvdf membrane is only composed of c and f elements while after the addition of the copolymer and go nanosheets as shown in fig s2b c and e respectively the o element is also observed in the composition demonstrating their successful incorporation furthermore along with the o element the si element can be easily discerned in fig s2d f h by which the incorporation of go sio2 into the gs 0 3 co gs 0 15 co gs 0 3 and co gs 0 45 membrane samples can be strongly demonstrated fig 6 exhibits the ft ir spectra of all the fabricated membranes it is obvious in all the spectra that the peaks related to the pvdf backbone have emerged at 1399 1176 and 1068 cm 1 which are ascribed to the ch2 cf2 and cc stretching vibrations in addition the peaks emerged at 1277 878 and 838 cm 1 also correspond to the vibration bands of the β phase moreover the peak evident at 763 cm 1 is also related to the vibration of the pvdf α phase 50 by drawing a comparison between the spectra of the neat pvdf membrane and those containing the pvdf g pmma copolymer it can be discerned that the most important difference is the strong peak appeared at 1736 cm 1 in the spectra of those containing pvdf g pmma which is related to the co group in pmma 34 36 also the characteristic peaks of go in the spectra of the membranes with go and gs nanoparticles have emerged at 1636 and 1727 cm 1 which are ascribed to the cc and co stretching vibrations respectively furthermore in comparison with go the new peaks appeared at 799 959 and 1078 cm 1 in the spectra of the membranes with gs which are related to the siosi symmetric vibration sioh stretching vibration and siosi asymmetric stretching vibration respectively demonstrate the successful incorporation of go sio2 nanoparticles into the pvdf membranes 51 the xrd diffraction peaks of go and go sio2 nanoparticles are exhibited in fig 4 and the xrd diffraction peaks of the prepared membranes are exhibited in fig 7 by drawing a comparison between these two figures it can be discerned that the peaks related to go and go sio2 nanoparticles have overlapped with those of the pvdf backbone the peaks emerged at 18 40 25 3 36 79 and 40 6 correspond to the α phase pvdf while the peak appeared at 20 49 is related to the β phase pvdf although the peaks related to the nanoparticles are not evident the integral area of the peaks emerged at 18 40 and 20 49 have clearly decreased through the incorporation of go copolymer and go sio2 arising from the reduction of pvdf crystallinity it is obvious that the more nanoparticles have been added and the more agglomerations have been formed the more crystallinity has decreased 50 3 4 membranes characterization morphological studies figs 8 and s2 shows the cross sectional fesem images of the fabricated membranes in which the asymmetric open cellular spongy structure with finger like cavities are obvious in all the membranes cross section 9 according to the literature the size of the finger like cavities is related to a balance between the velocity of water molecules as the non solvent that enter the polymer solution and the velocity of the solvent molecules that leave the polymer solution the incorporation of both the copolymer and nanoparticles can considerably enhance the hydrophilic nature of the membrane leading to a faster transport of water molecules into the polymer solution and therefore formation of larger cavities 52 53 all the aforementioned findings are easily discernible in fig 8 by drawing a comparison between the neat membrane morphology and that of other mmms fig 9 shows the surface fesem images of all the prepared membranes on which the incorporated nanoparticles and copolymer are easily discerned according to scheme 2 the incorporation of both the nanoparticles and the copolymer coupled with each other leads to a much better dispersion of nanoparticles and negligible agglomerations hence the go 0 3 and gs 0 3 show a higher agglomerations than the coupled ones moreover it can be found that the more the loading amount has increased the more agglomeration has also increased accordingly although the co go 0 15 and co go 0 3 membranes exhibit no agglomerations by increasing the nanoparticles content some agglomerations have been formed on the surface of the co go 0 45 sample which leads to deterioration in the membrane performance 13 bet analysis was also conducted on the neat pvdf membrane and the co gs 0 3 membrane as the optimum sample to investigate the nanoparticles effect on the pores characteristics of the membrane accordingly it can be seen that through the incorporation of the co gs nanoparticles pore size has decreased from 35 nm for the neat membrane to 25 3 nm for the co gs 0 3 membrane furthermore the bet surface area has also increased from 4 07 m2 g for the neat membrane to 6 21 m2 g for the co gs 0 3 membrane all these findings demonstrate that although cavities have enlarged in the modified membranes cross section based on the fesem results the overall pore size distribution has decreased after the incorporation of nanoparticles especially the surface pore sizes leading to a much better rejection performance fesem mapping analysis was utilized as an effective tool for investigating the elements dispersion in the prepared co gs 0 3 membrane according to fig s4 all the elements are obvious and their good dispersion throughout the membrane surface can be demonstrated by which the formation of the efficient co gs 0 3 membrane can be confirmed afm analysis was also conducted to evaluate the roughness parameters of the fabricated membranes surface as exhibited in fig 10 and table s1 it is obvious that the addition of the prepared copolymer fig 10a b has negligibly increased the roughness of the neat membrane moreover the addition of the nanoparticles fig 10c d has considerably increased the membrane surface roughness arising from their agglomerations on the surface on the other hands although the incorporation of both nanoparticles and the copolymer fig 10e f has increased the membrane surface roughness the roughness is lower than that of the membranes with only nanoparticles maybe arising from their lower agglomerations as shown in scheme 2 3 5 membranes characterization hydrophilicity studies contact angle analysis was conducted for all the prepared samples to evaluate the effect of the prepared copolymer and nanoparticles on the hydrophilic nature of the membranes the less the contact angle the more the hydrophilic nature 54 55 as can be seen in fig 11 by the addition of the copolymer and nanoparticles into the membranes matrix hydrophilicity has increased arising from their high hydrophilic nature furthermore the hydrophilicity of the membranes incorporated with go and gs is better than that of the copolymer incorporated membrane arising from the higher hydrophilicity of nanoparticles when compared to the prepared copolymer additionally it was found that the hydrophilic nature can be enhanced more as a result of the synergistic effect if both the copolymer and nanoparticles are incorporated into the membrane matrix it can be attributed to the good dispersion of nanoparticles without any agglomerations due to the interactions with the copolymer in the membrane matrix 56 3 6 membranes characterization separation performance to investigate the separation performance of the prepared membranes their flux and dyes rejection for direct yellow and crystal violet were evaluated via the self made cell under the pressure of 7 bar according to fig 12 the membranes flux has been considerably enhanced after the addition of the copolymer go and gs nanoparticles separately or in a coupled way when compared to the neat pvdf membrane it is well known that go nanosheets act as porous nanoparticles providing an additional channel for permeation of water molecules 57 graphene and its derivatives are capable of providing a clear molecular cutoff along with considerable selectivity because of their well arranged laminar structure as well as the well defined interlayer space 8 furthermore it has been demonstrated in the literature that through the narrow interspace existing between the go sheets 58 an ultrafast transport of water and other solvents can be provided resulting in a significant permeate flux 59 furthermore the nanoparticles and copolymer can enhance the hydrophilic nature of the mmms leading to a higher flux 52 moreover it can be discerned that the incorporation of gs has a higher impact on enhancing flux arising from the more hydrophilic functional groups provided via sio2 nanoparticles the rejection performance of the modified membranes was also enhanced in comparison to the neat one it was found that the incorporation of both the copolymer and nanoparticles could provide a synergistic effect by which a higher rejection ability could be obtained when compared to the membranes with only nanoparticles or the copolymer the highest rejection performance was obtained by the co gs 0 3 sample which could reject 99 8 of dy and 99 5 of cv dye molecules 3 6 1 permeate flux versus time fluxes of the c0 and co gs 0 3 membranes versus time are displayed in fig s5 in which it can be easily seen that the prepared co gs 0 3 membrane possesses a better antifouling performance as a result of introducing both the copolymer and go sio2 nanoparticles which has resulted in no significant changes in the flux performance through time the above mentioned findings are probably due to the effect of the added copolymer and go sio2 nanoparticles in enhancing water permeability 9 3 6 2 long term durability according to fig s6 for the purpose of evaluating the durability of the co gs 0 3 membrane in a long run its flux and dye rejection capability were investigated through running the experiments for ten consecutive days 9 accordingly the obtained results demonstrated that the fabricated co gs 0 3 membrane could provide a superb ability in the rejection of the dy and cv dyes for long periods it was proved that no significant changes was occurred in the dye rejection after ten days while flux exhibited a continuous decline as a result of both dilution and the fouling effect according to all the above mentioned results it can be confirmed that the co gs 0 3 sample has shown no deterioration in rejection ability through time comparison of nanofiltration membranes reported by other articles and the m2 sample prepared in this study is listed in table 2 based on which it can be strongly confirmed that the membrane prepared in our work has a superior performance 4 conclusions here mixed matrix nanofiltration pvdf membranes mmms were prepared with different loading amounts of the pvdf g pmma copolymer and go and go sio2 gs nanoparticles separately and in coupled with each other accordingly the atrp and modified hummer methods were employed for the preparation of the copolymer through grafting methyl methacrylate monomers onto the pvdf backbone and the synthesis of graphene oxide nanosheets respectively in the next step the as prepared go nanosheets were loaded with sio2 nanoparticles in order to obtain a better performance it was found that the membrane with 0 3 wt copolymer and go sio2 could provide a high dye rejection of 99 8 for dy and 99 5 for cv and water flux as high as 2 5 l m2 h bar moreover its water flux and dye rejection were also evaluated versus time by which an excellent durability and superb antifouling abilities were achieved

development of pharmaceutical industry sectors in china in the last decades increased public concern has been focus on serious detriments to both human and environment associated with a wide range of substances including raw materials organic solvents reactants intermediates generated in manufacturing processes 1 2 more seriously pharmaceutical industry is among the most polluting of the industries in terms of large water consumption besides in response to the fact that northern china has suffered from a scarcity of water for industrial and rural processes due to an exhaustible water supply sustainable strategy of water resources is expected however so far it is still a lack of information in reclaiming the various types of wastewater from pharmaceutical industry in china especially in full scale treatment for this reason it is urgent to explore a promising and feasible technology for reclamation of pharmaceutical wastewater preferably in treating high cod concentration and low levels of biodegradability of industrial wastewaters anaerobic process is firstly implemented due to low chemical consumption energy recovery and low surplus sludge production 3 following the anaerobic treatment aerobic process is often conducted for further organic pollutants removal however it is still insufficient to meet the stricter discharge or reclamation requirements thus further post treatment after anaerobic aerobic was required currently in the context of reusable water though an expansive option membrane bioreactor mbr is still a mainstream technology because it can effectively retain most microorganisms and has the capability of producing superior quality of treated effluent in single footprint 4 in this sense the hybrid system with anaerobic aerobic reactor followed by a mbr should be very competitive in treating pharmaceutical wastewater to produce high quality effluent for the purpose of possible recycling reuse from application perspective elevation of uaf and contact oxidation system efficiency to high strength wastewater is of great importance uasb upflow anaerobic sludge bed as the most widely applied high rate anaerobic reactor often encounters a large number of anaerobic sludge losses and organic pollutants remove efficiency is thus inferior up flow anaerobic bio filter uaf outperforms uasb because it can be operated with its large biomass attachment high organic loadings and long sludge age since porous media inside can facilitate microorganisms immobilization 5 similarly the contact oxidation system is superior to traditional activated sludge process because contact oxidation is also incorporated with a fixed filter to develop biofilm for prevention of microorganisms from being washed out the favorable aggregation situations for microbes have the preferable merit of easy start up resisting shock load and toxicity up to now the main disadvantage of porous plastic materials as microbial carriers is lower surface wettability in this study a highly hydrophilic lightweight ceramic material ceramsite was selected as a promising microbial carrier alternative for sludge retention in uaf and contact oxidation system recently the application of ceramic membranes in membrane bioreactor mbr is a hot trend the ceramic membranes can offer several advantages over conventional polymeric membranes such as the higher permeate flux better mechanical and chemical stability more rugged cleaning method and the feasibility in a wide range of treatment conditions 6 however membrane fouling is still a major obstacle in the development of ceramic membrane generally the physical cleaning such as air scouring system is the most representative option to prevent membrane fouling however despite energy consumption the system can t still achieve satisfactory result in practical engineering trials typically no research was founded about performance of a full scale plant using an innovative auto brush cleaning aiding ceramic membrane mbr to further solve the fouling issues in order to sustain long term membrane permeability thus in this full scale study the main purposes are 1 to investigate the

technical option for reclamation of such pharmaceutical wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 the source and quality of pharmaceutical wastewater raw feed water to this full scale treatment plant located in a pharmaceutical raw material manufacturer shandong province china was the mixed discharged water 1400 m3 day of three factories including ammonium sulfate sodium methyl sulfate and acetanilide manufacturing apartment the mixed wastewater mainly contained diverse chemicals including aniline dichloroethane sodium methyl sulfate meta phenol and some unknown compounds table 1 summarized the main characteristics of pharmaceutical wastewater and required discharge standard for the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for urban miscellaneous water consumption gb t 18920 2002 table 1 toilet flushing road cleaning and urban landscaping apparently it illustrated that pharmaceutical wastewater had high organic matter and lower b c ratio which was suitable for anaerobic process as pretreatment 2 2 the system description and experimental design the schematic diagram of the pilot study was illustrated in fig 1 the experiment was performed with a uaf reactor with an effective volume of 2800 m3 φ16 16 m aerobic concrete tank with an effective volume of 7000 m3 and mbr tank with a size of 15 m 5 m 5 m l w h raw feed water from the different manufacturing apartments was firstly distributed to the grille by the pumps thereafter an equalization concrete tank of 1500 m3 was installed to adjust ph and alkalinity for uaf and functioned as a regulating pool to stabilize certain fluctuations in raw wastewater uaf reactor consisted of pulse water inlet system below the reactor and a gas solid separator above the reactor and was packed with porous lightweight ceramsite effluent from the uaf reactor gravitationally flowed into contact oxidation system which was formed by packing porous lightweight ceramsite as the carriers into conventional activated sludge system the main components of ceramsite were 56 of sio2 21 of al2o3 8 5 of fe2o3 3 5 of cao and 2 7 of mgo the diameter of ceramsite ranged from 3 to 6 mm and specific surface area was around 7 4 m2 g the fourteen sets of flat sheet of ceramic membrane module l1740 w760 h3100 mm were immersed in the ceramic mbr tank an ceramic membrane module was equipped with 200 pieces of zro2 coated al2o3 ceramic membrane l1024 w250 thk6 mm with pore size of 0 1 μm and auto controlled brush cleaning equipment for membrane fouling resistance which was supplied by bocent advanced ceramic company pingxiang city jiangxi province china above mentioned ceramic flat sheet membranes 2800 m2 of total area were installed in the mbr tank brush was fixed at the middle of every two pieces of ceramic membrane and was driven automatically by fluid power system the permeate water from the ceramic mbr was introduced into the permeate tank by suction pump two online backwash pumps were fixed on the backwash line which was same line with inlet flow finally prior to reuse naclo was applied for disinfection in the disinfecting tank fig 1 during the whole wastewater treatment one blower was operated for providing air to aerobic biological treatment process and another one for providing scouring air to ceramic membrane fouling alleviation seed sludge vss of 22 5 mg l for starting up uaf and contact oxidation system was collected from secondary settling tank in a local sewage treatment plant the uaf and contact oxidation system were inoculated with 400 m3 and 105 m3 of sewage sludge respectively the uaf reactor and contact oxidation system in the present study were operated with the hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 0 day and 5 0 day respectively a 160 day run was conducted and divided into four main stages comprising start up and three steady state stages the reactor operating conditions are summarized in table 2 the progressive augment of olr organic loading rate up to 2 8 g cod l d by elevating raw wastewater cod by stepwise model was realized through diluting water in the lake near the plant from stage ii day 21 contact oxidation tank and ceramic membrane mbr will receive the uaf effluent for further treatment 2 3 chemical analysis effluent from each treatment unit and influent from the distribution tank were regularly obtained for cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and vfa measurement according to a previous study 7 bod5 was determined using bodtrak ii hach u s 2 4 illumina miseq sequencing regarding the microbial community structure the sludge sample was taken from the bottom of the bioreactor on the 160th day the extrication of genomic dna by the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s was completed according to the manufacturer s protocols details for the amplification of 16s rrna genes for archaea and bacteria and the pyrosequencing procedure statistical and bioinformatics analysis were introduced elsewhere 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 uaf performance the operation of the uaf contact oxidation system fell into 4 stages mainly respecting the influent cod and ammonia which lasted 160 days table 2 with reference to uaf process performance effluent cod ph and vfa was detected after 7 days operation in order to firstly wash out inactive sludge in raw inoculated sludge uaf influent cod concentration increased from 1000 mg l to 2000 mg l at an fixed hrt of 2 day corresponding to initial olr of 0 5 g cod l d to 1 4 g cod l d from day 1 to day 40 as set up period stage i ii fig 2a b parallel to this increment in the influent strength the ubf effluent cod varied from 197 mg l to 469 mg l reflecting satisfactory cod abatement efficiency in the range from 75 80 fig 2a b this highlighted that immobilization technology using novel porous lightweight ceramsite was a powerful tool to shorten the adaptation time of the uaf system a key hindrance in traditional anaerobic bioreactors was massive sludge washout resulting in a large fluctuation in cod abatement and slow granule sludge formation 9 10 moreover methanogenic bacteria suffered from slow rate of growth problem which led to the extreme importance of start up period for accumulation of microbial community to degrade organic pollutants 11 up to now ceramsite is a favoured microbial carrier widely selected in the anaerobic aerobic rectors moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr biological aerated filters baf etc in china the main shortcoming of the common organic microbial carrier such as pe is slow rate of biofilm formation because of lower surface wettability a large number of hydroxyl on the surface of ceramsite mainly made of al2o3 can ensure higher biofilm attachment ability and higher compatibility with microbe which significantly avoid sludge washout and shorten start up period starting from day 41 stage iii further increase of olr to around 1 4 g cod l d corresponding to influent cod of 4200 mg l fig 2a b showed the negligible difference for cod removal efficiency 72 at influent cod of 4200 mg l finally in stage iv day 61 160 when the uaf system was operated at highest olr up to 2 8 g cod l d corresponding to influent cod of 8400 mg l the cod removal efficiency dropped to 66 with reference to uaf process performance in terms of vfa the stepwise elevation of olr led to an significant increase of vfa level from initial approximately 110 mg l to around 1300 mg l at the highest olr operated fig 2d in parallel accompanying with the vfa elevation the ph of effluent decreased to around 6 5 at the stage iv fig 2c furthermore the result of uaf process fig 3 showed that the nh4 n contents in the uaf effluent showed a slight augment of about 30 comparing to the influents reflecting that the ammonification process took place in the uaf to transform a certain amount of organic nitrogen to nh4 n although the excellent anaerobic performance in terms of organic pollutants abatement the uaf effluent was not able to meet the discharge standards for the reuse thus requiring further treatments 3 2 contact oxidation system and ceramic membrane based mbr performance following the uaf process the wastewater entered the contact oxidation process satisfactory cod removal in the uaf guaranteed the low operation loading in aerobic stage thus within the initial 60 days operation the contact oxidation effluent cod flocculated in a range of 50 1125 mg l corresponding to cod removal efficiency up to around 90 when the cod of uaf effluent raised up to around 2600 mg l and the olr was elevated to approximate 0 5 g cod l d cod removal with observed efficiencies lightly decreased to around 85 table 2 and fig 4 the cod removal efficiency of the mbr remained constant at a rate of approximately 89 throughout the experiment while the cod values in the mbr permeate raised gradually from 20 mg l at day 21 to 95 mg l at day 61 fig 4 for the treated ceramic membrane permeate bod5 was consistently below 20 mg l which met the reuse standards fig 4 nh4 n removal was mainly removed in contact oxidation system and kept stable at 95 regardless of the fluctuation of olr fig 3 thus throughout all periods of operation high organic pollutant and nh4 n was maintained via the combination of uaf contact oxidation system and ceramic membrane based mbr according to the literature 12 due to their hydrophilicity ceramic membranes are less susceptible to organic fouling prone to organic fouling if compared with polymeric membranes such as pvdf pes membrane fouling alleviation via membrane surface modification is an innovative and emerging strategy to enhance the hydrophilicity of membrane surface by the presence of organic pollutants and or microorganisms in contact to al2o3 ceramic membrane water flux became obviously greater under the same pressure because of more hydroxyls on the surface of the membrane when the al2o3 ceramic membrane was grafted with the nano sized tetragonal zro2 coats 12 this was because zro2 assisted ceramic membrane will possess more hydroxyls plus the fact that the polarization of zr4 can facilitate the hydrolysis of hydroxyls in the surface of zro2 12 it is worthy to note that the binding with ethylene glycol peg can also increase the hydrophilicity of ceramic membrane in the case of large scale project the graft of zro2 often attained more application than other chemicals besides the filtration ability of membrane the operation protocol including operation duration and frequency of backwashing had key influences on mbr performance 13 it was reported by a previous study 14 that a 10 min mbr membrane filtration plus 0 75 min backwashing model was more efficient than another 33 3 min mbr membrane filtration plus 0 75 min backwashing model in this study based on a large number of tests the ceramic mbr was automatically operated at a service cycle of 9 min suction 1 min pause and 1 min backwash generally on line chemical cleaning must be conducted when the tmp trans membrane pressure of ceramic membrane mbr was around 65 kpa it should be emphasized that physical cleaning and surface modification of membrane can only alleviate the membrane fouling to some extent and delay the onset of severe membrane fouling and chemical cleaning would ultimately be implemented for eliminating irreversible membrane fouling as observed from fig 5 the respective tmp profile showed in the filtration process indicated that tmp increased gradually and the ceramic membrane mbr system stably sustained a longer operation period at a higher permeate around average 25 l m2 h from day 20 day 160 it can be further observed from fig 5 that the dramatic drop of tmp to 10 kpa companied with the almost total recovery of flux to 25 l m2 h happened after every chemical cleaning comparatively a control lab scale trial applying the same ceramic membrane module fixed with air scouring system without the aid of brush scrubbing revealed that tmp increased sharply and reached the threshold of around 60 kpa only after 8 days of operation necessitating chemical cleaning data not shown if compared with brush aiding membrane module which could last 25 days fig 5 thus it was conceivable that the brush system as an innovative and economic mechanically cleaning option was capable of adequately mitigate reversible membrane fouling by scouring the membrane detaching the deposited cake layer since reversible fouling was often defined as fouling that can be cancelled by physical means generally extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp were recognized as main pollutants causing membrane fouling 13 though detailed characterization of foulants in this study have not well investigated intensive physical cleaning such as circulating scouring agents was reported to achieve good fouling mitigation performance and restore their permeability especially for ceramic membranes because ceramic membrane was both physically and chemically robust 15 3 3 microbial community anaerobic and aerobic degradation performance relays on the quantity function and structure of microorganisms present in the reactor the community structure of samples enriched at the end of the operation was investigated based on illumina miseq high throughput sequencing technology the numbers of otus determined at 97 sequence similarity for each library were listed in table 3 the high value of good s coverage reflected that the outcome of sequencing analysis could indicate the real profile of sample the chao1 and ace represented the richness of microbial community content while shannon index and simpson indices indicated the diversity of microbial community content 3 3 1 archaea and bacteria structure and diversity in uaf system cod removal and methane production in anaerobic degradation process can be achieved by methanogensis as revealed at genus level from fig 6 the largest group belonged to methanosarcina which accounted for 38 13 of total archaeal community on 160 days methanosarcina consumed acetate for growth and involves in methane production the abundance of methanosarcina could be enriched by the successive accumulation of acetate concentration in uaf accompanied by the augmented operational olrs unclassfied thermoplasmata was the second abundance with 36 31 relative abundance followed by methanofollis with 9 58 relative abundance which could only convert h2 and co2 to produce methane in summary the result of archeal composition indicated that acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen gained higher community richness in archaeal prolife which could explain the large volume of methane production from water sealed tank on the top of uaf in the case of bacteria library the observed number of operational taxonomic units otus and the shannon index was as high as 602 and 3 676 indicating higher diversity than archeal case table 3 the bacterial structure with the 6 most abundant phyla which accounted for 91 of the average abundance fig 7 the uaf was rich in firmicutes with 42 02 relative abundance followed by thermotogae 22 91 bacteroidetes 13 59 synergistetes 10 4 firmicutes are commonly widespread in a variety of anaerobic reactors members of firmicutes can be observed to deliver extracellular enzymes such as cellulose lipase and protease which will play vital role in hydroxylation process 16 besides because firmicutes had the capacity to decompose monomers such as alcohol vfas some amino acids and aromatic compounds into acetate 8 it was reasonable to conclude that firmicutes was closely related to covert aniline and meta phenol in the raw wastewater into acetate thermotogae was highly enriched in variety of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants 17 like firmicutes bacteroidetes and synergistetes was able to degrade macromolecules into small molecules in both hydrolysis and fermentation steps we must emphasize that bacteroidetes were found as a dominant phylum involved in generation of biofilm which was speculated to have protected them from the toxic compounds existed in the pharmaceutical wastewater 18 in addition the observation of phylum thermotogae was also detected in the mature biofilm 19 thus judging from higher abundance of bacteroidetes and thermotogae detected it was clear that rich film for microorganism accumulation was well developed by porous lightweight ceramsite in this engineering practice some species affiliation with synergistetes could play certain role in fermenting lactic acid or acetic acid to product h2 and co2 as for genus level the largest genus group was petrotoga which accounted for 21 72 in the library fig 6 organisms related to petrotoga have previously been isolated from cstr in thermophilic anaerobic digestion of food waste as dominant bacterial genus to play the important role in the degradation of organic matter 20 thus it can be speculated that the appearance of highest relative abundance of petrotoga could be responsible for pronounced cod removal in uaf the second group 8 81 was affiliated with aminobacterium related genera which could be associated with the degradation of amino acid in anaerobic environment soehngenia 4 18 of relative abundance was previously reported to degradation of an intermediate in anaerobic phenol degradation 21 thus anaerobic degradation performance relayed on a variety of functional genes involved in four processes ranging from hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis to methanogensis in implementing organic pollutants removal and methane yield 3 3 2 bacteria in contact oxidation system in long term operation process the higher value of the shannon index and the lower value of the simpson index means the more diversity of microbial content from table 3 it can be concluded that day 160 sludge in contact oxidation system exhibited higher content richness and significant difference from the uaf as shown in fig 7 the relative abundance of the major functional bacteria at phylum levels was firstly analyzed the five most abundant phyla including proteobacteria unclassfied bacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes and firmicutes accounted for 41 7 15 71 7 28 6 69 and 5 98 respectively proteobacteria phyla was an expected member of microbial community because appearance of proteobacteria might be associated with the cod abatement in contact oxidation system because proteobacteria species could participate in the breakdown of a wide variety of organic matter which were often dominated species in treating a broad spectrum of wastewater in aerobic and anaerobic environment 16 furthermore proteobacteria can account for biological nitrogen and phosphorous removal 22 obviously as time went on the aerobic environment in contact oxidation system became more favorable for the development of chloroflexi than anaerobic condition only 0 93 of relative abundance in uaf the observation was inconsistent with a previous conclusion that under anaerobic condition chloroflexi was the most dominant phylum in a membrane biofilm reactor while it should decline significantly if the dissolved oxygen was fed 23 chloroflexi presence can be responsible to the nh4 and tn removal because some chloroflex related microorganism can be involved in both nitrification and denitrification 24 in addition chloroflex as a filamentous species played a key role for the aerobic granules stability and was closely linked with the compactness of the granule structures 25 26 like anaerobic treatment bacteroidetes and firmicutes were commonly highly enriched in the aerobic process in term of genus level 65 23 species were unclassified reflecting the complexity of bacterial community in contact oxidation system the contact oxidation system was rich in thauera with a relative abundance of 6 63 in addition as previously reported bacterial genus thauera was thought to be a phenol methylphenol and indole aromatic degrader 27 thauera was identified as the most dominant species which had the perfect potential in nitrification and denitrification 28 in addition in the previous literature thauera was observed to be capable of secreting extracellular polymeric substances eps 23 similarly acinetobacter with a relative abundance of 4 63 can also contributed to eps production it was well known that the abundant eps producers can play an essential role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the aerobic granules the relative abundance of thauera and acinetobacter implied that eps might be one of main pollutants in this project thereby resulting in membrane fouling acinetobacter can be also able to nitrification as heterotrophic nitrifier 28 organisms related to truepera composed the relative abundance of 2 07 members of bacterial family truepera existed in some extreme activated sludge systems stimulated by high salt or different aromatics reflecting a high resistance ability to impact from environmental hazards 29 a certain proportion of aeromonas 2 82 was also detected on the sludge according to a previous study 30 a well functioning heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification bacteria was identified as aeromonas from activated sludge and could have a certain capacity in ammonia nitrite and nitrate removal 4 conclusion after 160 days successive treatment by the engineering scale it can be concluded that sequent anaerobic and aerobic treatment followed by submerged flat sheet ceramic membrane mbr modified nano sized tetragonal zro2 coats was a promising stagey to achieve high cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies with a high quality effluent for reclamation the final effluent met the discharge standard for the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for urban miscellaneous water consumption gb t 18920 2002 table 1 toilet flushing road cleaning and urban landscaping from a practical viewpoint problems associated with membrane fouling were addressed by auto mechanical brush aiding membrane module matched with intensive aeration cleaning which enabled operations of mbr at higher membrane flux apparent difference in both diversity and richness of the microbial community was observed in sludge day160 in uaf and contact oxidation system in addition dominant species that were responsible for acetate growth methane production cod abatement nitrification related to anaerobic and aerobic process respectively

13088,this project aimed to assess the feasibility of applying uaf contact oxidation followed by ceramic membrane mbr in reclaiming 1400 m3 day of pharmaceutical wastewater with cod and nh4 n of around 8400 and 135 mg l respectively uaf and contact oxidation system employed novel porous lightweight ceramsite as microbial carriers to facilitate the biomass retention results revealed that the integrated biological treatment experienced excellent and stable performance in the operation of successive 160 days in terms of cod and nh4 n abatement around 96 8 and 81 respectively with the aid of auto mechanical bush and air scouring in submerged flat sheet nano zro2 coated ceramic membrane mbr for mitigating the membrane fouling the mbr exhibited stable and better performance to remove suspended solid and soluble microbial products with around flux of 25 lmh and no severe fouling was observed during the whole treatment process the mbr effluent can be reclaimed for road cleaning urban landscaping etc miseq sequencing analysis in the sludge day 160 indicated that uaf was rich in firmicutes with 42 02 relative abundance followed by thermotogae 22 91 and bacteroidetes 13 59 which can decompose macromolecules into small molecules moreover some species in thermotogae and bacteroidetes accounted for generation of biofilm in the ceramsite in uaf genus petrotoga played a key role in conspicuous cod removal in uaf the bacterial species composition in contact oxidation exhibited substantially discrepant appearance of proteobacteria as the dominant phylum 41 7 can be

development of pharmaceutical industry sectors in china in the last decades increased public concern has been focus on serious detriments to both human and environment associated with a wide range of substances including raw materials organic solvents reactants intermediates generated in manufacturing processes 1 2 more seriously pharmaceutical industry is among the most polluting of the industries in terms of large water consumption besides in response to the fact that northern china has suffered from a scarcity of water for industrial and rural processes due to an exhaustible water supply sustainable strategy of water resources is expected however so far it is still a lack of information in reclaiming the various types of wastewater from pharmaceutical industry in china especially in full scale treatment for this reason it is urgent to explore a promising and feasible technology for reclamation of pharmaceutical wastewater preferably in treating high cod concentration and low levels of biodegradability of industrial wastewaters anaerobic process is firstly implemented due to low chemical consumption energy recovery and low surplus sludge production 3 following the anaerobic treatment aerobic process is often conducted for further organic pollutants removal however it is still insufficient to meet the stricter discharge or reclamation requirements thus further post treatment after anaerobic aerobic was required currently in the context of reusable water though an expansive option membrane bioreactor mbr is still a mainstream technology because it can effectively retain most microorganisms and has the capability of producing superior quality of treated effluent in single footprint 4 in this sense the hybrid system with anaerobic aerobic reactor followed by a mbr should be very competitive in treating pharmaceutical wastewater to produce high quality effluent for the purpose of possible recycling reuse from application perspective elevation of uaf and contact oxidation system efficiency to high strength wastewater is of great importance uasb upflow anaerobic sludge bed as the most widely applied high rate anaerobic reactor often encounters a large number of anaerobic sludge losses and organic pollutants remove efficiency is thus inferior up flow anaerobic bio filter uaf outperforms uasb because it can be operated with its large biomass attachment high organic loadings and long sludge age since porous media inside can facilitate microorganisms immobilization 5 similarly the contact oxidation system is superior to traditional activated sludge process because contact oxidation is also incorporated with a fixed filter to develop biofilm for prevention of microorganisms from being washed out the favorable aggregation situations for microbes have the preferable merit of easy start up resisting shock load and toxicity up to now the main disadvantage of porous plastic materials as microbial carriers is lower surface wettability in this study a highly hydrophilic lightweight ceramic material ceramsite was selected as a promising microbial carrier alternative for sludge retention in uaf and contact oxidation system recently the application of ceramic membranes in membrane bioreactor mbr is a hot trend the ceramic membranes can offer several advantages over conventional polymeric membranes such as the higher permeate flux better mechanical and chemical stability more rugged cleaning method and the feasibility in a wide range of treatment conditions 6 however membrane fouling is still a major obstacle in the development of ceramic membrane generally the physical cleaning such as air scouring system is the most representative option to prevent membrane fouling however despite energy consumption the system can t still achieve satisfactory result in practical engineering trials typically no research was founded about performance of a full scale plant using an innovative auto brush

to around 1300 mg l at the highest olr operated fig 2d in parallel accompanying with the vfa elevation the ph of effluent decreased to around 6 5 at the stage iv fig 2c furthermore the result of uaf process fig 3 showed that the nh4 n contents in the uaf effluent showed a slight augment of about 30 comparing to the influents reflecting that the ammonification process took place in the uaf to transform a certain amount of organic nitrogen to nh4 n although the excellent anaerobic performance in terms of organic pollutants abatement the uaf effluent was not able to meet the discharge standards for the reuse thus requiring further treatments 3 2 contact oxidation system and ceramic membrane based mbr performance following the uaf process the wastewater entered the contact oxidation process satisfactory cod removal in the uaf guaranteed the low operation loading in aerobic stage thus within the initial 60 days operation the contact oxidation effluent cod flocculated in a range of 50 1125 mg l corresponding to cod removal efficiency up to around 90 when the cod of uaf effluent raised up to around 2600 mg l and the olr was elevated to approximate 0 5 g cod l d cod removal with observed efficiencies lightly decreased to around 85 table 2 and fig 4 the cod removal efficiency of the mbr remained constant at a rate of approximately 89 throughout the experiment while the cod values in the mbr permeate raised gradually from 20 mg l at day 21 to 95 mg l at day 61 fig 4 for the treated ceramic membrane permeate bod5 was consistently below 20 mg l which met the reuse standards fig 4 nh4 n removal was mainly removed in contact oxidation system and kept stable at 95 regardless of the fluctuation of olr fig 3 thus throughout all periods of operation high organic pollutant and nh4 n was maintained via the combination of uaf contact oxidation system and ceramic membrane based mbr according to the literature 12 due to their hydrophilicity ceramic membranes are less susceptible to organic fouling prone to organic fouling if compared with polymeric membranes such as pvdf pes membrane fouling alleviation via membrane surface modification is an innovative and emerging strategy to enhance the hydrophilicity of membrane surface by the presence of organic pollutants and or microorganisms in contact to al2o3 ceramic membrane water flux became obviously greater under the same pressure because of more hydroxyls on the surface of the membrane when the al2o3 ceramic membrane was grafted with the nano sized tetragonal zro2 coats 12 this was because zro2 assisted ceramic membrane will possess more hydroxyls plus the fact that the polarization of zr4 can facilitate the hydrolysis of hydroxyls in the surface of zro2 12 it is worthy to note that the binding with ethylene glycol peg can also increase the hydrophilicity of ceramic membrane in the case of large scale project the graft of zro2 often attained more application than other chemicals besides the filtration ability of membrane the operation protocol including operation duration and frequency of backwashing had key influences on mbr performance 13 it was reported by a previous study 14 that a 10 min mbr membrane filtration plus 0 75 min backwashing model was more efficient than another 33 3 min mbr membrane filtration plus 0 75 min backwashing model in this study based on a large number of tests the ceramic mbr was automatically operated at a service cycle of 9 min suction 1 min pause and 1 min backwash generally on line chemical cleaning must be conducted when the tmp trans membrane pressure of ceramic membrane mbr was around 65 kpa it should be emphasized that physical cleaning and surface modification of membrane can only alleviate the membrane fouling to some extent and delay the onset of severe membrane fouling and chemical cleaning would ultimately be implemented for eliminating irreversible membrane fouling as observed from fig 5 the respective tmp profile showed in the filtration process indicated that tmp increased gradually and the ceramic membrane mbr system stably sustained a longer operation period at a higher permeate around average 25 l m2 h from day 20 day 160 it can be further observed from fig 5 that the dramatic drop of tmp to 10 kpa companied with the almost total recovery of flux to 25 l m2 h happened after every chemical cleaning comparatively a control lab scale trial applying the same ceramic membrane module fixed with air scouring system without the aid of brush scrubbing revealed that tmp increased sharply and reached the threshold of around 60 kpa only after 8 days of operation necessitating chemical cleaning data not shown if compared with brush aiding membrane module which could last 25 days fig 5 thus it was conceivable that the brush system as an innovative and economic mechanically cleaning option was capable of adequately mitigate reversible membrane fouling by scouring the membrane detaching the deposited cake layer since reversible fouling was often defined as fouling that can be cancelled by physical means generally extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp were recognized as main pollutants causing membrane fouling 13 though detailed characterization of foulants in this study have not well investigated intensive physical cleaning such as circulating scouring agents was reported to achieve good fouling mitigation performance and restore their permeability especially for ceramic membranes because ceramic membrane was both physically and chemically robust 15 3 3 microbial community anaerobic and aerobic degradation performance relays on the quantity function and structure of microorganisms present in the reactor the community structure of samples enriched at the end of the operation was investigated based on illumina miseq high throughput sequencing technology the numbers of otus determined at 97 sequence similarity for each library were listed in table 3 the high value of good s coverage reflected that the outcome of sequencing analysis could indicate the real profile of sample the chao1 and ace represented the richness of microbial community content while shannon index and simpson indices indicated the diversity of microbial community content 3 3 1 archaea and bacteria structure and diversity in uaf system cod removal and methane production in anaerobic degradation process can be achieved by methanogensis as revealed at genus level from fig 6 the largest group belonged to methanosarcina which accounted for 38 13 of total archaeal community on 160 days methanosarcina consumed acetate for growth and involves in methane production the abundance of methanosarcina could be enriched by the successive accumulation of acetate concentration in uaf accompanied by the augmented operational olrs unclassfied thermoplasmata was the second abundance with 36 31 relative abundance followed by methanofollis with 9 58 relative abundance which could only convert h2 and co2 to produce methane in summary the result of archeal composition indicated that acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen gained higher community richness in archaeal prolife which could explain the large volume of methane production from water sealed tank on the top of uaf in the case of bacteria library the observed number of operational taxonomic units otus and the shannon index was as high as 602 and 3 676 indicating higher diversity than archeal case table 3 the bacterial structure with the 6 most abundant phyla which accounted for 91 of the average abundance fig 7 the uaf was rich in firmicutes with 42 02 relative abundance followed by thermotogae 22 91 bacteroidetes 13 59 synergistetes 10 4 firmicutes are commonly widespread in a variety of anaerobic reactors members of firmicutes can be observed to deliver extracellular enzymes such as cellulose lipase and protease which will play vital role in hydroxylation process 16 besides because firmicutes had the capacity to decompose monomers such as alcohol vfas some amino acids and aromatic compounds into acetate 8 it was reasonable to conclude that firmicutes was closely related to covert aniline and meta phenol in the raw wastewater into acetate thermotogae was highly enriched in variety of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants 17 like firmicutes bacteroidetes and synergistetes was able to degrade macromolecules into small molecules in both hydrolysis and fermentation steps we must emphasize that bacteroidetes were found as a dominant phylum involved in generation of biofilm which was speculated to have protected them from the toxic compounds existed in the pharmaceutical wastewater 18 in addition the observation of phylum thermotogae was also detected in the mature biofilm 19 thus judging from higher abundance of bacteroidetes and thermotogae detected it was clear that rich film for microorganism accumulation was well developed by porous lightweight ceramsite in this engineering practice some species affiliation with synergistetes could play certain role in fermenting lactic acid or acetic acid to product h2 and co2 as for genus level the largest genus group was petrotoga which accounted for 21 72 in the library fig 6 organisms related to petrotoga have previously been isolated from cstr in thermophilic anaerobic digestion of food waste as dominant bacterial genus to play the important role in the degradation of organic matter 20 thus it can be speculated that the appearance of highest relative abundance of petrotoga could be responsible for pronounced cod removal in uaf the second group 8 81 was affiliated with aminobacterium related genera which could be associated with the degradation of amino acid in anaerobic environment soehngenia 4 18 of relative abundance was previously reported to degradation of an intermediate in anaerobic phenol degradation 21 thus anaerobic degradation performance relayed on a variety of functional genes involved in four processes ranging from hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis to methanogensis in implementing organic pollutants removal and methane yield 3 3 2 bacteria in contact oxidation system in long term operation process the higher value of the shannon index and the lower value of the simpson index means the more diversity of microbial content from table 3 it can be concluded that day 160 sludge in contact oxidation system exhibited higher content richness and significant difference from the uaf as shown in fig 7 the relative abundance of the major functional bacteria at phylum levels was firstly analyzed the five most abundant phyla including proteobacteria unclassfied bacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes and firmicutes accounted for 41 7 15 71 7 28 6 69 and 5 98 respectively proteobacteria phyla was an expected member of microbial community because appearance of proteobacteria might be associated with the cod abatement in contact oxidation system because proteobacteria species could participate in the breakdown of a wide variety of organic matter which were often dominated species in treating a broad spectrum of wastewater in aerobic and anaerobic environment 16 furthermore proteobacteria can account for biological nitrogen and phosphorous removal 22 obviously as time went on the aerobic environment in contact oxidation system became more favorable for the development of chloroflexi than anaerobic condition only 0 93 of relative abundance in uaf the observation was inconsistent with a previous conclusion that under anaerobic condition chloroflexi was the most dominant phylum in a membrane biofilm reactor while it should decline significantly if the dissolved oxygen was fed 23 chloroflexi presence can be responsible to the nh4 and tn removal because some chloroflex related microorganism can be involved in both nitrification and denitrification 24 in addition chloroflex as a filamentous species played a key role for the aerobic granules stability and was closely linked with the compactness of the granule structures 25 26 like anaerobic treatment bacteroidetes and firmicutes were commonly highly enriched in the aerobic process in term of genus level 65 23 species were unclassified reflecting the complexity of bacterial community in contact oxidation system the contact oxidation system was rich in thauera with a relative abundance of 6 63 in addition as previously reported bacterial genus thauera was thought to be a phenol methylphenol and indole aromatic degrader 27 thauera was identified as the most dominant species which had the perfect potential in nitrification and denitrification 28 in addition in the previous literature thauera was observed to be capable of secreting extracellular polymeric substances eps 23 similarly acinetobacter with a relative abundance of 4 63 can also contributed to eps production it was well known that the abundant eps producers can play an essential role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the aerobic granules the relative abundance of thauera and acinetobacter implied that eps might be one of main pollutants in this project thereby resulting in membrane fouling acinetobacter can be also able to nitrification as heterotrophic nitrifier 28 organisms related to truepera composed the relative abundance of 2 07 members of bacterial family truepera existed in some extreme activated sludge systems stimulated by high salt or different aromatics reflecting a high resistance ability to impact from environmental hazards 29 a certain proportion of aeromonas 2 82 was also detected on the sludge according to a previous study 30 a well functioning heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification bacteria was identified as aeromonas from activated sludge and could have a certain capacity in ammonia nitrite and nitrate removal 4 conclusion after 160 days successive treatment by the engineering scale it can be concluded that sequent anaerobic and aerobic treatment followed by submerged flat sheet ceramic membrane mbr modified nano sized tetragonal zro2 coats was a promising stagey to achieve high cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies with a high quality effluent for reclamation the final effluent met the discharge standard for the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for urban miscellaneous water consumption gb t 18920 2002 table 1 toilet flushing road cleaning and urban landscaping from a practical viewpoint problems associated with membrane fouling were addressed by auto mechanical brush aiding membrane module matched with intensive aeration cleaning which enabled operations of mbr at higher membrane flux apparent difference in both diversity and richness of the microbial community was observed in sludge day160 in uaf and contact oxidation system in addition dominant species that were responsible for acetate growth methane production cod abatement nitrification related to anaerobic and aerobic process respectively were further revealed through miseq pyrosequencing declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

13089,the general perception of rainwater is that it is pure clean and safe to drink as it is a product of vapor condensation however rainwater easily gets polluted from catchment surface such as roofs and gutters like other countries in rural areas of australia people generally drink rainwater without any formal treatment which is not in line with the australian government s health advice drinking untreated harvested rainwater is likely to impact human health therefore treatment and disinfection of harvested rainwater are required to meet the drinking water guidelines and protect public health the aim of this review is to systematically analyze the current literature on harvested rainwater treatment and disinfection methods and their effectiveness there has been limited research on small scale disinfection systems which are especially suitable and sustainable for rainwater harvesting systems in rural areas a scoping review method has been adopted in this study which has shown that there is a need to pre treat the harvested rainwater before formal disinfection more importantly treated rainwater needs protection from recontamination similar to mains water if the water is to be stored over a longer period for subsequent use furthermore it is found that hypochlorite could be an effective disinfectant as it can offer residual effects and is readily available and cost effective a sustainable disinfection method which is easy to operate and cost effective in rural settings is needed to achieve maximum advantage of disinfection by hypochlorite in order to design such an efficient chlorination system measurement of chlorine demand and optimum chlorine dose rate are required which are discussed in this study to conclude harvested rainwater requires pre treatment and disinfection before human consumption an adequate chlorination method can easily be adapted to make the harvested rainwater drinkable at the household level finally the proposed technology could significantly improve the rural water supply in both developed and developing countries which will assist in meeting a number of sustainable development goals sdgs keywords rainwater drinking water chlorination disinfection recontamination sdg hypochlorite rural water supply 1 introduction water is a basic need and hence it is expected that every human being has access to safe and affordable drinking water 1 increasing drinking water demand in large cities needs massive investment in infrastructure 2 deterioration of water quality caused by human activities and climate change has stressed freshwater resources in many countries supplying safe drinking water is a challenging issue in isolated communities and in areas where skilled labours are limited and big investment is not financially viable even in the developed countries this issue is prevalent in rural areas one proposed solution to rural water supply is rainwater harvesting rwh however two questions are relevant in recommending rainwater use for human consumption i is water from a rwh system safe to drink ii does this water meet local drinking water guidelines in this regard there is no consensus and hence rainwater has not been widely adopted for drinking purpose in rural areas according to bain et al 3 water sources can be categorised into two groups improved and unimproved besides centralised potable water they considered rwh as an improved source because it is unlikely to be contaminated from outside sources and hence it can be a potential source of drinking water on the contrary it has been argued that harvested rainwater is not safe to drink 4 as many researchers have demonstrated that it often contains both chemical and biological contaminants for example ahmed et al 5 identified several sources that can pollute rainwater such as trees bird nests roof materials atmospheric pollution deposition and animal faeces 6 collecting materials and storage systems 7 furthermore some harmful microbiological contaminants such as campylobacter spp salmonella spp giardia lamblia and escherichia coli have been detected in the rainwater sample 5 macdonald et al 8 mentioned that any chemical oxygen demand cod in the treated water implies possibility of microbiological regrowth this study demonstrated that numerous contaminants in several water samples exceeded the limit as set by the world health organization who 5 adequate rainwater treatment can remove contaminants and make it safe to drink 9 therefore it is desirable to treat the water provided by a rwh system to comply with local drinking water guidelines 2 researchers have proposed various methods to make water from a rwh meeting potable water standards the most common areas of this treatment have focused on storage and distribution 2 they also mentioned several treatment systems that can be adopted to make harvested rainwater safe to drink such as first flush diversion gross filtration fine filtration ultraviolet and chemical disinfection in this regard sobsey et al 10 noted that disinfection had been the central area of interest in relation to rainwater treatment the most common and affordable disinfection method in centralised water distribution systems is chlorination 10 12 however for small water systems like an isolated rwh this is not the best option because of several challenges i complexity of mixing chemicals ii inconvenience in storing chemicals iii deterioration of water quality in terms of taste and odour with time iv inability to remove two vital water borne micro organisms which are cryptosporidium parvum and giardia lamblia cysts 13 and v lack of technical knowledge by the individual householders to operate a chemical based water treatment system including ongoing monitoring and testing of water furthermore to determine the chlorination dose rate chlorine demand needs to be predicted to calculate chlorine demand in raw water there are several methods such as measuring total trihalomethane 14 measuring both total organic carbon and contact time 15 which is not easy to understand by householders this area lacks significant research and warrants further investigations to propose a viable treatment system for isolated rwh in rural areas the aim of this review paper is to investigate whether standard methods can be used to determine chlorine demand for a small household rwh system moreover treated harvested rainwater can be re contaminated if it is stored for a longer period of time and hence the presence of residual chlorine in the treated water is important therefore this review focuses on i how recontamination can be prevented during storage of water in rainwater tanks ii can chlorination stop recontamination iii is chlorination feasible technically and financially to disinfect harvested rainwater on a small scale iv does one need filtration before chlorination for the roof harvested rainwater and v how one can determine chlorine demand easily that can be used by an ordinary person operating a rwh system at the household level 2 methodology of review based on the literature review presented above it may be argued that many people in the rural areas often drink untreated rainwater and hence these people fall at the risk of microbiological infection by micro organisms such as giardia lamblia salmonella spp campylobacter cryptosporidiosis and clostridium botulinum 16 it is important to identify proper disinfection methods to treat harvested rainwater before human consumption therefore in this review an attempt was made to investigate the quality of harvested rainwater in the existing literature and identify adequate disinfection methods with respective advantages and disadvantages in treating harvested rainwater several research questions related to the harvested rainwater quality and disinfection methods were asked and a scoping review was performed to find the answers of those questions the selection of scoping review instead of systematic review was because this area had not been explored vastly in the past the idea was to locate and map the related research studies first by a scoping review and then perform by an in depth analysis on a specific topic through a systematic review the research questions that were asked in this review are as below 1 why is disinfection necessary when harvested rainwater is used to replace potable water 2 what are the advantages of pre treatment before disinfection as generally rainwater is not highly contaminated 3 which pre treatment processes are the most sustainable 4 what disinfection methods are available and the most sustainable ones at a domestic level 5 is chlorination a better option 6 what is the best possible method to predict chlorine demand 7 what are the challenges in the current disinfection methods for small scale applications to answer these questions three key topics that have been recognized as vital are the pollutants in harvested rainwater various cost effective water treatment techniques and drinking water quality guidelines furthermore these research questions have also exposed two future research scopes which are 1 chlorination on a small scale 2 potential recontamination of treated harvested rainwater hrw several keywords related to the topic were used to identify the peer reviewed research articles from scopus google scholar and web of science the list of keywords and the related number of articles are shown in table 1 a total of 1163 papers were found among these 82 were selected as they answer the research questions related to this study a manual scrutiny method was followed in finalizing the selected 82 papers that were used in writing this review all the selected papers were peer reviewed the methodology section clearly explains how experiments were conducted and the relevant data collected a methodology flowchart for the review is shown in fig 1 3 quality of harvested rainwater roof harvested rainwater is mostly limited to domestic scale which is known as domestic rwh generally people s perception about domestic rwh is that the quality of water is good as it is coming from rain and hence it is safe to drink therefore many people drink rainwater delivered by a domestic rwh system without any formal treatment 17 however rainwater contamination can occur at different points such as rain drops travelling through the polluted air important in industrial areas catchments used to collect runoff and storage tank materials 17 by both undesirable chemicals and micro organisms these contaminants are likely to make adverse effects on human health in this regard hamilton et al 18 suggested that untreated rainwater can be the source of lymphadenitis in children and can also cause infection in adults it is also mentioned that in victoria salmonella in queensland campylobacter and in new south wales giardia lamblia were spread due to untreated rainwater these incidents were found predominantly in aged care facilities and holiday camps abbasi and abbasi 19 identified various sources that can pollute harvested rainwater as noted below roof geometry such as size exposure and inclination roof materials that include chemical characteristics of roof roughness surface coating roof age sealing and joining materials such as lead and possibility of weathering location of roofs such as nearby trees and air quality of the area frequency of roof maintenance environmental conditions during rainfall wind speed and presence of pollutants in the surrounding air other metrological aspects such as seasons weather conditions like droughts and floods studies have shown that pollutants present in the atmosphere can a affect rwh water quality 20 21 researchers around the world have conducted studies and presented evidence of typical chemical contaminations in hrw table 2 presents a summary of chemical compounds concentration mg l in rainwater samples globally from table 2 two questions arise a does hrw generally meet drinking water quality guidelines b if hrw is consumed without treatment what could be the possible health consequences in this review we have compared the results with drinking water guidelines of world health organization who the contaminant concentrations in hrw samples shown in table 2 are compared with who s drinking water guidelines in table 3 aluminum calcium chlorine lead manganese and nitrite concentrations are exceeded in many cases among these chemicals lead is the most detrimental to human health which was found in china thailand south korea and australia the percentage of exceedance of the chemicals and their possible health impacts are presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively from table 3 it is found that lead concentration in harvested rainwater samples in china for the reported case is 310 in south korea 100 and in thailand 70 higher than who s recommended limit the health hazards due to lead include neurological damage in children kidney damage interfering with red blood cell and bone formation it is understood that in the northern china table 3 aluminum concentration was 68 higher than who s recommended limit but this does not have a major impact on the human body 37 higher calcium concentration was identified in the northern china thailand zambia bermuda south korea palestine greece mexico australia and nigeria excessive calcium may develop stones in the kidney there is no study on the long term effect of these metallic contaminants e g cumulative effect on the human body which is important if one drinks harvested rainwater for a long period of time a higher concentration of manganese was found in northern china which was 12 higher than the who recommended limit in palestine and mexico nitrite concentrations in the harvested rainwater were 40 and 28 higher respectively than who s recommended limit it is also noted that in some locations fluoride is absent in harvested rainwater therefore fluoride supplement dosing may be required to reduce dental decay if harvested rainwater is to be used by a person for many years as a single source of potable water it should be noted that according to kwaadsteniet et al 17 viruses and protozoa are the major sources of microbiological contamination in rwh systems ahmed et al 40 suggested that faeces from animals such as squirrels possums rats and birds are the major source of microbiological contaminants when rain falls on a roof these unwanted animal droppings and organic debris which likely contain bacteria and protozoa are washed off and accumulated inside the rainwater tank table 6 presents possible health effects due to microbiological contamination they may cause serious illnesses especially gastro related ones children could be at risk of fatality if the treatment is not given on time table 7 shows the pollution level found in water samples collected from rainwater tanks in various locations of the world according to who 37 guidelines drinking water must be free from any microbial contamination table 7 shows that all the reported samples have exceeded who drinking water quality guidelines if rainwater is stored in the tank for a long period water quality is likely to change during the storage period and protozoa and other bacteria may grow in water 7 40 upon drinking this type of contaminated water various diseases showed in table 5 can spread among the community ahmed et al 16 mentioned that there were cases in different countries where people suffered from diarrhea vomiting abdominal pain nausea legionnaires headache and fever because of drinking untreated water from a rwh system diels et al 55 concluded that in australia health hazard due to microbiological contamination is relatively more significant than chemical contamination except for some considerable industrial polluted areas tables 2 3 and 4 present data on this issue methods such as diversion precipitation filtration and disinfection may be considered to treat rainwater to make it suitable for consumption outside australia there are few success stories on simple treatment methods which have reduced diseases caused by micro organism significantly for example lantagne and yates 56 mentioned that in liberia at an internally displaced camp 95 of the water from rwh were applied prescribed treatment method as a result diarrhea was reduced by 67 in this area and the likelihood of diarrhea was decreased by 77 in bangladesh death due to cholera was reduced by about 40 by using clean nylon clothes and sari for water filtration 57 in kenya solar disinfection reduced 88 of diarrheal infections in children in south sudan chlorine tablets were distributed among the community which reduced 82 of cholera spreading by drinking water from these results it is understood that water treatment such as filtration and disinfection can minimize health risk significantly therefore water from domestic rwh systems requires treatment prior to human consumption 4 treatment of harvested rainwater meera and ahammed 58 as well as helmreich and horn 59 suggested that there are several methods that can be used for water filtration such as membrane filtration slow sand filtration filtration by granular activated carbon media filtration by dual media sand coal and gravel and filtration through nylon clothes for disinfection they also suggested several methods but not all of these are suitable for domestic purposes and cost effective however several disinfection methods are considered for domestic purposes such as chlorination tablet liquid chlorine ultraviolet uv and solar disinfection according to 17 water in the rwh system can be treated mainly in two ways a treating in the storage tank in this method rainwater needs to be screened prior to being stored in the tank but this method does not allow sufficient filtration time as the filtration process needs a relatively long time only disinfection can be done but sometimes it is generally less efficient if the turbidity is high in the incoming rainwater b removing water from the storage tank and treating it separately this method fig 2 allows sufficient filtration and disinfection as both processes are done in separate locations fig 2 shows a typical method of water treatment in a rwh system heavy metal can be removed through precipitation depending on the chemical contents in water coagulants such as aluminum sulphate can be added for enhanced sedimentation if there is a presence of significant amount of dissolved and suspended materials filtration methods which are likely to be economical and suitable for the remote communities are discussed below 4 1 filtration methods filters can remove suspended particles from water 60 alim et al 61 recognized the advantages of filtration as noted below improve microbiological and physiochemical qualities significantly remove odour and bad taste reduce turbidity caused by various suspended particles and reduce chemicals and microbiological contamination the ceramic filter may be used as low cost water filtration option in cambodia clay pots are manufactured from locally acquired clay by cambodian government and non governmental organisations ngos to create porosity it is mixed with rice husk and water afterwards it is moulded in a cone shape and fired in 870 c 62 to reduce growth of micro organisms the filter is painted with agno3 ceramic filter can be effective moderately against microbial pathogens the authors tested ceramic filters for both rainwater and surface water to test their performances in their study e coli reduction was achieved at 99 2 log10 level and reduction of viruses was in the range of 90 99 1 2 log10 in contrast to ceramic filters a slow sand filter has sand and supporting gravel beds it is relatively low cost for domestic purposes and simple to operate but for industrial or large scale applications the investment cost is high due to its large area requirement and structural support of heavy materials if the filter is to be located at an elevated place ellis and wood 63 mentioned that a slow sand filter is effective for surface water treatment in small towns and villages heavy metals protozoa e coli and bacteria can be removed significantly by slow sand filter as the filter removes suspended solids the efficiency of disinfection improves 63 treated water generally exits from the filter by gravity a slow sand filter can reduce turbidity by about 95 viruses by 1 log removal value lrv bacteria by 2 lrv and protozoa by 2 lrv granular activated carbon gac filter can remove dissolved organic carbon doc and natural organic material by adsorption this method has been used for many years 64 gac filtration is also used for removing natural organic material odour and unpleasant taste 65 naddeo et al 66 mentioned that gac can reduce turbidity by 59 7 e coli by 67 9 220 cfu 100 ml and total coliform tc by 59 8 91 cfu 100 ml there are other filtration methods such as nylon cloth can be used for very basic filtration which has been found to be effective in reducing turbidity in water and spreading diarrhea in rural communities in bangladesh 56 it has a mesh size of 150 μm and can reduce about 2 log units of cholera bacteria dual media which is a combination of sand and gac media 67 can remove e coli from urban water by about 63 2 lrv 0 43 68 however its performance varies with season which means that during rainy season efficacy of e coli reduction is smaller than in dry season 8 hence they strongly recommended disinfecting dual media filtered water tables 8 and 9 summarises the advantages and disadvantages of various types of filters 4 2 disinfection methods disinfection is necessary to deactivate bacteria pathogens and various harmful micro organism in full extent to make the water fit for drinking 59 the authors further suggested several effective disinfection methods for rainwater which include chlorination by tablets liquid chlorination ultraviolet and solar disinfection 4 2 1 chlorination chlorination is quite common and it is easy to disinfect raw rainwater with it however there are few issues needing attention for example chlorine should be applied in the pipe or mixing tank rather than in storage tank because it may react with organic matter and settle at bottom of storage tank 71 according to helmreich 2009 to kill germs properly the free chlorine concentration should be 0 4 to 0 5 mg l at least for 15 min sources of chlorine could be chlorine tablet chlorine gas or hypochlorite solution the dose rate varies according to the chlorine demand of the water from various research it is found that filtration can reduce total organic carbon toc or natural organic matter nrm in water which can contribute to reduced chlorine demand wilhelm et al 72 mentioned that for higher turbidity in water more chlorine is needed the disadvantage of chlorination is that it is not effective on some protozoa such as cryptosporidium and giardia additionally it can create by products that could be harmful 4 2 2 ultraviolet disinfection ultraviolet disinfection method can also be used to disinfect rainwater when dna and rna of micro organisms absorb the uv light their dna and rna structure changes that stops them to regenerate i e they are unable to cause diseases despite their metabolically alive state the main advantage of uv system is that it can be effective for killing protozoa such as cryptosporidium and giardia and it does not produce any by products like chlorination craik et al 73 mentioned that both low and medium level uv radiation can make cryptosporidium effectively inactive the disadvantage is that there is no recontamination protection after the disinfection 74 the microbiological recontamination can happen shortly after the disinfection if the treated water is left in the tank or jar for a longer time 4 2 3 thermal pasteurisation disinfection disinfection can also be done through thermal pasteurisation where water is heated at 50 c to 70 c at this temperature the heat can kill micro organisms or make them inactive the most common and cost effective method in rural areas is boiling water by wood fire 75 4 2 4 solar disinfection in solar disinfection water is heated by sunlight 69 the water is stored in a bottle or container and then left in the sun it is very cost effective and very popular where the sun light is strong the water temperature in the container can reach to about 60 c many micro organisms become inactive due to sunlight and generated heat 76 these authors also found that solar collectors can provide better performance than just solar disinfection but the main disadvantage with this disinfection process is that it cannot be done at night time and on rainy days therefore it is effective where sunlight intensity is high such as africa some countries in asia and other countries where sunlight is available most of the time of the year the disadvantage of this method is that it does not offer recontamination protection like chlorination 4 2 5 boiling boiling of water with the help of fuel is an ancient and common method of disinfection 75 these authors identified that in most of the rural areas source of fire is wood the wood fire which is used to boil water over 55 c kills and makes most of the water borne micro organisms such as pathogenic bacteria viruses helminths and protozoa inactive in rural areas in kenya it was found that when the boiling temperature reached 70 c coliforms were reduced up to 70 there are several disadvantages such as boiling water by fire is linked to smoke greenhouse gas emission and reduction of the forest area table 10 compares various disinfection methods 5 benefit of pre treatment of harvested rainwater in the 1970s some researchers expressed concerns on health risks due to disinfection by products dbp it was identified that trihalomethanes thm have potential health effects which is a by product of chlorination 77 in malaysia halogenated organic contaminants were found in drinking water supplies due to chemical reactions between chlorine and other contaminants chemical species and organic materials according to this study dbp is not expected to be present in drinking water because they are teratogens mutagens carcinogens and toxic it is more advantageous if filtration is done before disinfection pre treatment such as first flush sedimentation and filtration can reduce solids natural organic matters and total organic carbon this will reduce the contaminant load used in disinfection 69 if it is uv system less intensity is required for chlorination chlorine demand is reduced 72 for sodis less sunlight intensity and less duration in sunlight are required for low turbidity or treated water sodium hypo is to be dosed at the rate of 1 88 mg l and for untreated water sodium hypo is to be dosed at the rate of 3 75 mg l 72 burch and thomas 1998 analysed and compared the advantages and disadvantages among different domestic water harvesting treatment methods roughing filter consisting of fine gravel and coarse sand and slow sand filter was noted to be a cost effective option in villages subject to low cost labour they added that chlorine and uv are also relatively less costly but they are less effective in high turbidity hence pre treatment is needed to get a better outcome for chlorination supply should be uninterrupted and whoever operates the chlorine treatment system would require training on the other hand uv treatment is relatively simple compared to chlorination it could be potentially powered by photo voltage pv and has less storage cost as it can be operated as per demand but it requires the facility of accessing spare parts and necessary maintenance services from both village and household perspectives solar pasteurisation treatment may be very attractive as the associated treatment and maintenance costs are very low the main drawback of this method is it is not effective during wintertime from analysis by clasen et al 75 it is clear that treatment cost is higher on household scale compared to village scale the authors noted the costs of treatment per person are chlorination cost 0 66 person filtration cost 3 03 person solar disinfection cost 0 63 person and flocculation disinfection cost 4 95 person according to li et al 78 in ireland during 2009 the general cost for a domestic rwh system was 1500 to 4000 if storage capacity is 1500 l to 10 000 l the expected electricity consumption is 1 kwh a day the cost to build a storage tank in africa differs notably from any european country helmreich and horn 2009 mentioned that a 2 m3 tank could cost 20 to 30 and for a 20 m3 tank it could be 120 to 140 6 challenges in selecting a disinfection method ahmed et al 79 and hamilton et al 18 found that people can be exposed to harmful pathogens such as salmonella inva giardia lamblia legionella pneumophila mip and campylobacter jejuni mapa genes by consuming untreated harvested rainwater uhrw through a ingestion by drinking uhrw regularly 2 ingestion by accident during hosing or other outdoor activities by using uhrw and 3 aerosol ingestion during shower regularly with uhrw water therefore it is prudent to treat rainwater in such a way that the quantity of micro organisms in the uhrw can be reduced below the threat level a number of techniques have been developed to treat uhrw 79 however adoption of these techniques depends on several factors awareness of communities quality of domestic harvested rainwater turbidity presence of chemical species and micro organisms economical state of the community local labour cost available infrastructure in the respective area or community number of people consuming rainwater storage capacity of rainwater tank climatethe area sanitation practices of the community and prevention of micro organism appearance in post treated water during storage period 7 challenges in chlorination at a domestic scale naddeo et al 66 suggested that instead of chlorine gas a liquid hypochlorite solution is preferable because it is less hazardous and easy to distribute to rural communities however other disinfection methods can be applicable at a domestic level hypochlorite can be effective if cryptosporidium and giardia are not present in the uhrw however avoiding recontamination after post treatment chlorination can be a better option than any other disinfection method as during chlorination total and free chlorine residuals can reduce the risk of recontamination 69 alekal et al 13 pointed out the significant challenges for chlorination at a small scale as follows complexity of mixing chemical inconvenience of storing chemical deterioration of water quality parameters in terms of taste and odour inability to remove two strong water borne micro organisms which are cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and giardia lamblia cysts 8 chlorine demand calculation according to who the recommended c t value is 15 mg l min who 2011 which means effective disinfection by chlorination can be achieved at 0 5 mg l free chlorine concentration for 30 min australian drinking water guidelines follow the same principle australian drinking water guidelines 6 2011 version 3 5 updated august 2018 based on the above guideline from the drinking water storage tank to the tap the minimum free chlorine must be 0 5 mg l burch and thomas 69 acknowledged that identifying the right amount of dosing chlorine and maintaining suitable residual chorine level before ingestion is a very complex procedure however to determine a hypochlorite storage facility with an automatic dosing system it is useful to predict chlorine demand researchers have identified various ways of calculating chlorine demand as noted below 9 chlorine decay method as chlorine is a non selective oxidant it reacts with both organic and inorganic chemicals species the reaction rate varies depending on the nature of the species chlorine decay in bulk water can be calculated based on either a first order or second order kinetics 15 first order chlorine concentration decay can be expressed by 1 c t c 0 exp kt c t is the chlorine concentration at time t c 0 is the initial chlorine concentration and k is first order decay constant this formula considers only chlorine fading in the water and does not consider other reactants with which it may react with boccelli et al 14 considered both chlorine decay and the reactants that react with chlorine as chlorine demand furthermore warton et al 15 plotted initial chlorine concentration against chlorine concentration after a period of time t they plotted chlorine decay in 5 min to 4 h and 4 h to 168 h and developed the following equation 2 c 0 a b exp d t warton et al 15 also developed another equation to predict the required chlorine dose to achieve desired chlorine concentration 3 c 0 e f c t here f is the slope of the linear function and e is the y intercept the values of e and f are specific for a given time t hence it is clear from the above three equations that chlorine decay can be presented by linear equations if the initial chlorine concentration is known the chlorine concentration can be predicted after a certain period besides linear formulae there are models which can predict chlorine doses 80 9 1 chlorine demand calculation from by product formation besides the linear formula as noted above two more models can be used for predicting chlorine demand which is the trihalomethanes thm model and chlorine demand model abdullah et al 80 9 2 chlorine demand model abdullah et al 80 suggested that ammonia in the water can influence the chlorine demand they commented that ammonia reacts with chlorine and form chloramine they developed a regression equation with three independent variables ph suva and ammonia 4 chlorine demand a ph b suva c ammonia d where a 101 614 b 0 216 c 0 237 d 0 576 thm model 5 thm a chlorine dosage b suva c ph d where a 10 1 783 b 0 663 c 0 227 d 0 478 from the analysis it was found that in terms of prediction accuracy the chlorine demand thm model is associated with less error than the chlorine demand model 80 10 discussion in australia roof harvested rainwater rhrw is a primary source of drinking water in many rural households surprisingly in a capital city like adelaide some residents preferred rhrw over mains water 81 the limited knowledge about the water quality between mains water and rhrw and taste are the primary reasons for this choice but in rural areas the reasons to prefer rhrw above supplied water are different than those in big cities which are economic disadvantage poor water quality absence of water supply from municipality although people s perception of rainwater is pure in reality it is not the case in most instances water is contaminated by various sources while saved in a storage tank the contaminants are either chemicals or microbiological or a combination of both the sample data from various researchers indicate that the location surrounding environment and type of catchments can dictate the type of contaminants in the harvested rainwater 19 this variation of contaminants in the harvested rainwater samples at different countries and cities is evident in tables 1 and 5 it is also noticed in table 2 that harmful chemical contaminants such as lead cadmium and arsenic have been detected in harvested rainwater at unacceptable concentrations long term ingestion of this type of untreated rhrw can harm multiple organs in the human body refer to table 4 furthermore according to table 6 rhrw contains harmful micro organisms such as fecal coliform e coli and enterococci at significant concentrations which can pose a potential risk of a local pandemic therefore rhrw treatment is indispensable to retain public health in both remote and metropolitan cities among many of the previously discussed treatment methods it is found that filtration is very effective against chemical contaminants and effective against microbiological organisms to a great extent among all the low cost filters refer table 6 ceramic filter is the best performed filtration method in terms of removing micro organism besides micro organism log reduction value removing odour and maintaining taste are also important factors in choosing a filtration method in this context dual media is the preferred option compared to the ceramic filter as it has got both sand and granular activated carbon as filter media which reduce germs and odour and maintain good taste in the filtered water 67 82 on many occasions rhrw consumers filter their water before consumption however little evidence of the disinfection of rhrw was found after the filtration table 6 shows that germs remaining in rwrh after filtration and micro organisms are removed partially in india macdonald et al 8 found that after filtration remaining organic carbon and activated micro organisms can grow and contaminate while rhrw is stored and that is why for drinking purposes australian drinking water guideline has emphasised disinfection disinfection can work mostly against the germs such as bacteria viruses and protozoa however burch and thomas 69 suggested filtering water prior to implementing disinfection to enhance disinfection efficiency potential high turbidity in rhrw can undermine disinfection effectiveness they further confirmed that filtration improves disinfection performance significantly this review paper refer table 9 compares advantages and disadvantages among various disinfection methods subject to consumer s financial capability availability of disinfectants type of micro organisms in rhrw and surrounding environmental factors largely dictate the selection of the best disinfection method senevirathna et al 2 designed an ultraviolet uv system with a granular activated carbon gac filter which was found to be cost effective however this system would need consistent power supply uv lamps and technical support to build such a system furthermore people with limited financial means may not be able to afford a uv disinfection system at home among other disinfection methods solar disinfection is another effective and cost effective one for remote and low income areas 69 since it is impossible to get sufficient sunlight consistently throughout the year it may not be a good choice in most situations furthermore boiling water is also a low cost and popular disinfection method like solar disinfection the high temperature makes germs inactive for a certain period but the fuel source can be challenging on many occasions such as remote areas underdeveloped countries desert locations and wet seasons moreover it can cause pollution to environment and reduce the forest area mintz et al 11 12 and sobsey et al 10 suggested that chlorination is another disinfection method that is widely used and cost effective in a commercial context but not well developed and popular in domestic cases 13 burch and thomas 69 presented the cost and effectiveness of various treatment methods they also compared various combinations of different filtration and disinfection methods as summarised in table 11 the recent cost data are also included in the table to show a comparison about cost reduction over the time as we can see that the system cost has been decreased substantially with time considering the effectiveness and residual disinfection chlorination and rough filter gravel and fine sand media combination is found to be preferable to other methods however there are also other types of filters such as dual media filter ceramic filter and cloth filter which can be combined with various disinfection methods to verify their effectiveness from the above discussion it is understood that chlorination has a unique advantage which is residual effectiveness that no other disinfection method can provide as chlorinated water can be stored longer than any other treated water it can also be a potential disinfection method for domestic purposes however no standard system that runs automatically has been found which can be used to disinfect harvested rainwater by chlorination at a small scale therefore there is an opportunity to develop an automatic chlorination system for application at the individual household level the challenging issues in designing a chlorination device for small scale applications include predicting chlorine demand and determining the appropriate dose rate 11 conclusions rainwater harvesting rwh is an ancient practice of storing water for subsequent use recently this has received wider attention as an alternative fresh water source in urban areas rainwater is used in an effort to reduce the demand for mains water however harvested rainwater is used for potable and nonpotable purposes in most rural areas of australia and other countries people generally perceive roof harvested rainwater as clean and safe for drinking without any formal treatment however in this literature review it is found that rainwater is not safe to drink without treatment there are several treatment methods that can be implemented in treating the roof harvested rainwater though large scale filtration is a widely accepted water treatment method the effectiveness of filtration systems at a domestic scale in terms of quality and economic viability has rarely been investigated also the requirement of disinfection and the method of disinfection at a domestic scale is still a topic of discussion and further research therefore the aim of this review was to investigate how a domestic rainwater harvesting system can be used safely to produce potable water the major findings of this review are the followings o filtered rainwater followed by disinfection needs protection from recontamination after being stored for an extended period o hypochlorite could be very effective in delaying bacteria regrowth however on a domestic scale it is not adopted due to multiple limitations more research works are required to overcome these to develop a hypochlorite based domestic disinfection system o an efficient automatic disinfection system by sodium hypochlorite requires both chlorine demand measurements and optimum chlorine dose rate however as the roof harvested rainwater catchment materials and surrounding environments are non uniform it is complex to calculate chlorine demand and dosage at smaller scale applications o the chlorine decay model is more straightforward than the chlorine demand model for calculating chlorine demand o toc contributes to creating cdbp in water treatment process nonetheless not much data are available regarding toc in domestic harvested rainwater in australia o further research is required to configure an automatic rainwater treatment systems that would produce drinking water for consumers at household level which can be widely embraced in rural areas credit

13089,the general perception of rainwater is that it is pure clean and safe to drink as it is a product of vapor condensation however rainwater easily gets polluted from catchment surface such as roofs and gutters like other countries in rural areas of australia people generally drink rainwater without any formal treatment which is not in line with the australian government s health advice drinking untreated harvested rainwater is likely to impact human health therefore treatment and disinfection of harvested rainwater are required to meet the drinking water guidelines and protect public health the aim of this review is to systematically analyze the current literature on harvested rainwater treatment and disinfection methods and their effectiveness there has been limited research on small scale disinfection systems which are especially suitable and sustainable for rainwater harvesting systems in rural areas a scoping review method has been adopted in this study which has shown that there is a need to pre treat the harvested rainwater before formal disinfection more importantly treated rainwater needs protection from recontamination similar to mains water if the water is to be stored over a longer period for subsequent use furthermore it is found that hypochlorite could be an effective disinfectant as it can offer residual effects and is readily available and cost effective a sustainable disinfection method which is easy to operate and cost effective in rural settings is needed to achieve maximum advantage of disinfection by hypochlorite in order to design such an efficient chlorination system measurement of chlorine demand and optimum chlorine dose rate are required which are discussed in this study to conclude harvested rainwater requires pre treatment and disinfection before human consumption an adequate chlorination method can easily be adapted to make the harvested rainwater drinkable at the household level finally the proposed technology could significantly improve the rural water supply in both developed and developing countries which will assist in meeting a number of sustainable development goals sdgs keywords rainwater drinking water chlorination disinfection recontamination sdg hypochlorite rural water supply 1 introduction water is a basic need and hence it is expected that every human being has access to safe and affordable drinking water 1 increasing drinking water demand in large cities needs massive investment in infrastructure 2 deterioration of water quality caused by human activities and climate change has stressed freshwater resources in many countries supplying safe drinking water is a challenging issue in isolated communities and in areas where skilled labours are limited and big investment is not financially viable even in the developed countries this issue is prevalent in rural areas one proposed solution to rural water supply is rainwater harvesting rwh however two questions are relevant in recommending rainwater use for human consumption i is water from a rwh system safe to drink ii does this water meet local drinking water guidelines in this regard there is no consensus and hence rainwater has not been widely adopted for drinking purpose in rural areas according to bain et al 3 water sources can be categorised into two groups improved and unimproved besides centralised potable water they considered rwh as an improved source because it is unlikely to be contaminated from outside sources and hence it can be a potential source of drinking water on the contrary it has been argued that harvested rainwater is not safe to drink 4 as many researchers have demonstrated that it often contains both chemical and biological contaminants for example ahmed et al 5 identified several sources that can pollute rainwater such as trees bird nests roof materials atmospheric pollution deposition and animal faeces 6 collecting materials and storage systems 7 furthermore some harmful microbiological contaminants such as campylobacter spp salmonella spp giardia lamblia and escherichia coli have been detected in the rainwater sample 5 macdonald et al 8 mentioned that any chemical oxygen demand cod in the treated water implies possibility of microbiological regrowth this study demonstrated that numerous contaminants in several water samples exceeded the limit as set by the world health organization who 5 adequate rainwater treatment can remove contaminants and make it safe to drink 9 therefore it is desirable to treat the water provided by a rwh system to comply with local drinking water guidelines 2 researchers have proposed various methods to make water from a rwh meeting potable water standards the most common areas of this treatment have focused on storage and distribution 2 they also mentioned several treatment systems that can be adopted to make harvested rainwater safe to drink such as first flush diversion gross filtration fine filtration ultraviolet and chemical disinfection in this regard sobsey et al 10 noted that disinfection had been the central area of interest in relation to rainwater treatment the most common and affordable disinfection method in centralised water distribution systems is chlorination 10 12 however for small water systems like an isolated rwh this is not the best option because of several challenges i complexity of mixing chemicals ii inconvenience in storing chemicals iii deterioration of water quality in terms of taste and odour with time iv inability to remove two vital water borne micro organisms which are cryptosporidium parvum and giardia lamblia cysts 13 and v lack of technical knowledge by the individual householders to operate a chemical based water treatment system including ongoing monitoring and testing of water furthermore to determine the chlorination dose rate chlorine demand needs to be predicted to calculate chlorine demand in raw water there are several methods such as measuring total trihalomethane 14 measuring both total organic carbon and contact time 15 which is not easy to understand by householders this area lacks significant research and warrants further investigations to propose a viable treatment system for isolated rwh in rural areas the aim of this review paper is to investigate whether standard methods can be used to determine chlorine demand for a small household rwh system moreover treated harvested rainwater can be re contaminated if it is stored for a longer period of time and hence the presence of residual chlorine in the treated water is important therefore this review focuses on i how recontamination can be prevented during storage of water in rainwater tanks ii can chlorination stop recontamination iii is chlorination feasible technically and financially to disinfect harvested rainwater on a small scale iv does one need filtration before chlorination for the roof harvested rainwater and v how one can determine chlorine demand easily that can be used by an ordinary person operating a rwh system at the household level 2 methodology of review based on the literature review presented above it may be argued that many people in the rural areas often drink untreated rainwater and hence these people fall at the risk of microbiological infection by micro organisms such as giardia lamblia salmonella spp campylobacter cryptosporidiosis and clostridium botulinum 16 it is important to identify proper disinfection methods to treat harvested rainwater before human consumption therefore in this review an attempt was made to investigate the quality of harvested rainwater in the existing literature and identify adequate disinfection methods with respective advantages and disadvantages in treating harvested rainwater several research questions related to the harvested rainwater quality and disinfection methods were asked and a scoping review was performed to find the answers of those questions the selection of scoping review instead of systematic review was because this area had not been explored vastly in the past the idea was to locate and map the related research studies first by a scoping review and then perform by an in depth analysis on a specific topic through a systematic review the research questions that were asked in this review are as below 1 why is disinfection necessary when harvested rainwater is used to replace potable water 2 what are the advantages of pre treatment before disinfection as generally rainwater is not highly contaminated 3 which pre treatment processes are the most sustainable 4 what disinfection methods are available and the most sustainable ones at a domestic level 5 is chlorination a better option 6 what is the best possible method to predict chlorine demand 7 what are the challenges in the current disinfection methods for small scale applications to answer these questions three key topics that have been recognized as vital are the pollutants in harvested rainwater various cost effective water treatment techniques and drinking water quality guidelines furthermore these research questions have also exposed two future research scopes which are 1 chlorination on a small scale 2 potential recontamination of treated harvested rainwater hrw several keywords related to the topic were used to identify the peer reviewed research articles from scopus google scholar and web of science the list of keywords and the related number of articles are shown in table 1 a total of 1163 papers were found among these 82 were selected as they answer the research questions related to this study a manual scrutiny method was followed in finalizing the selected 82 papers that were used in writing this review all the selected papers were peer reviewed the methodology section clearly explains how experiments were conducted and the relevant data collected a methodology flowchart for the review is shown in fig 1 3 quality of harvested rainwater roof harvested rainwater is mostly limited to domestic scale which is known as domestic rwh generally people s perception about domestic rwh is that the quality of water is good as it is coming from rain and hence it is safe to drink therefore many people drink rainwater delivered by a domestic rwh system without any formal treatment 17 however rainwater contamination can occur at different points such as rain drops travelling through the polluted air important in industrial areas catchments used to collect runoff and storage tank materials 17 by both undesirable chemicals and micro organisms these contaminants are likely to make adverse effects on human health in this regard hamilton et al 18 suggested that untreated rainwater can be the source of lymphadenitis in children and can also cause infection in adults it is also mentioned that in victoria salmonella in queensland campylobacter and in new south wales giardia lamblia were spread due to untreated rainwater these incidents were found predominantly in aged care facilities and holiday camps abbasi and abbasi 19 identified various sources that can pollute harvested rainwater as noted below roof geometry such as size exposure and inclination roof materials that include chemical characteristics of roof roughness surface coating roof age sealing and joining materials such as lead and possibility of weathering location of roofs such as nearby trees and air quality of the area frequency of roof maintenance environmental conditions during rainfall wind speed and presence of pollutants in the surrounding air other metrological aspects such as seasons weather conditions like droughts and floods studies have shown that pollutants present in the atmosphere can a affect rwh water quality 20 21 researchers around the world have conducted studies and presented evidence of typical chemical contaminations in hrw table 2 presents a summary of chemical compounds concentration mg l in rainwater samples globally from table 2 two questions arise a does hrw generally meet drinking water quality guidelines b if hrw is consumed without treatment what could be the possible health consequences in this review we have compared the results with drinking water guidelines of world health organization who the contaminant concentrations in hrw samples shown in table 2 are compared with who s drinking water guidelines in table 3 aluminum calcium chlorine lead manganese and nitrite concentrations are exceeded in many cases among these chemicals lead is the most detrimental to human health which was found in china thailand south korea and australia the percentage of exceedance of the chemicals and their possible health impacts are presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively from table 3 it is found that lead concentration in harvested rainwater samples in china for the reported case is 310 in south korea 100 and in thailand 70 higher than who s recommended limit the health hazards due to lead include neurological damage in children kidney damage interfering with red blood cell and bone formation it is understood that in the northern china table 3 aluminum concentration was 68 higher than who s recommended limit but this does not have a major impact on the human body 37 higher calcium concentration was identified in the northern china thailand zambia bermuda south korea palestine greece mexico australia and nigeria excessive calcium may develop stones in the kidney there is no study on the long term effect of these metallic contaminants e g cumulative effect on the human body which is important if one drinks harvested rainwater for a long period of time a higher concentration of manganese was found in northern china which was 12 higher than the who recommended limit in palestine and mexico nitrite concentrations in the harvested rainwater were 40 and 28 higher respectively than who s recommended limit it is also noted that in some locations fluoride is absent in harvested rainwater therefore fluoride supplement dosing may be required to reduce dental decay if harvested rainwater is to be used by a person for many years as a single source of potable water it should be noted that according to kwaadsteniet et al 17 viruses and protozoa are the major sources of microbiological contamination in rwh systems ahmed et al 40 suggested that faeces from animals such as squirrels possums rats and birds are the major source of microbiological contaminants when rain falls on a roof these unwanted animal droppings and organic debris which likely contain bacteria and protozoa are washed off and accumulated inside the rainwater tank table 6 presents possible health effects due to microbiological contamination they may cause serious illnesses especially gastro related ones children could be at risk of fatality if the treatment is not given on time table 7 shows the pollution level found in water samples collected from rainwater tanks in various locations of the world according to who 37 guidelines drinking water must be free from any microbial contamination table 7 shows that all the reported samples have exceeded who drinking water quality guidelines if rainwater is stored in the tank for a long period water quality is likely to change during the storage period and protozoa and other bacteria may grow in water 7 40 upon drinking this type of contaminated water various diseases showed in table 5 can spread among the community ahmed et al 16 mentioned that there were cases in different countries where people suffered from diarrhea vomiting abdominal pain nausea legionnaires headache and fever because of drinking untreated water from a rwh system diels et al 55 concluded that in australia health hazard due to microbiological contamination is relatively more significant than chemical contamination except for some considerable industrial polluted areas tables 2 3 and 4 present data on this issue methods such as diversion precipitation filtration and disinfection may be considered to treat rainwater to make it suitable for consumption outside australia there are few success stories on simple treatment methods which have reduced diseases caused by micro organism significantly for example lantagne and yates 56 mentioned that in liberia at an internally displaced camp 95 of the water from rwh were applied prescribed treatment method as a result diarrhea was reduced by 67 in this area and the likelihood of diarrhea was decreased by 77 in bangladesh death due to cholera was reduced by about 40 by using clean nylon clothes and sari for water filtration 57 in kenya solar disinfection reduced 88 of diarrheal infections in children in south sudan chlorine tablets were distributed among the community which reduced 82 of cholera spreading by drinking water from these results it is understood that water treatment such as filtration and disinfection can minimize health risk significantly therefore water from domestic rwh systems requires treatment prior to human consumption 4 treatment of harvested rainwater meera and ahammed 58 as well as helmreich and horn 59 suggested that there are several methods that can be used for water filtration such as membrane filtration slow sand filtration filtration by granular activated carbon media filtration by dual media sand coal and gravel and filtration through nylon clothes for disinfection they also suggested several methods but not all of these are suitable for domestic purposes and cost effective however several disinfection methods are considered for domestic purposes such as chlorination tablet liquid chlorine ultraviolet uv and solar disinfection according to 17 water in the rwh system can be treated mainly in two ways a treating in the storage tank in this method rainwater needs to be screened prior to being stored in the tank but this method does not allow sufficient filtration time as the filtration process needs a relatively long time only disinfection can be done but sometimes it is generally less efficient if the turbidity is high in the incoming rainwater b removing water from the storage tank and treating it separately this method fig 2 allows sufficient filtration and disinfection as both processes are done in separate locations fig 2 shows a typical method of water treatment in a rwh system heavy metal can be removed through precipitation depending on the chemical contents in water coagulants such as aluminum sulphate can be added for enhanced sedimentation if there is a presence of significant amount of dissolved and suspended materials filtration methods which are likely to be economical and suitable for the remote communities are discussed below 4 1 filtration methods filters can remove suspended particles from water 60 alim et al 61 recognized the advantages of filtration as noted below improve microbiological and physiochemical qualities significantly remove odour and bad taste reduce turbidity caused by various suspended particles and reduce chemicals and microbiological contamination the ceramic filter may be used as low cost water filtration option in cambodia clay pots are manufactured from locally acquired clay by cambodian government and non governmental organisations ngos to create porosity it is mixed with rice husk and water afterwards it is moulded in a cone shape and fired in 870 c 62 to reduce growth of micro organisms the filter is painted with agno3 ceramic filter can be effective moderately against microbial pathogens the authors tested ceramic filters for both rainwater and surface water to test their performances in their study e coli reduction was achieved at 99 2 log10 level and reduction of viruses was in the range of 90 99 1 2 log10 in contrast to ceramic filters a slow sand filter has sand and supporting gravel beds it is relatively low cost for domestic purposes and simple to operate but for industrial or large scale applications the investment cost is high due to its large area requirement and structural support of heavy materials if the filter is to be located at an elevated place ellis and wood 63 mentioned that a slow sand filter is effective for surface water treatment in small towns and villages heavy metals protozoa e coli and bacteria can be removed significantly by slow sand filter as the filter removes suspended solids the efficiency of disinfection improves 63 treated water generally exits from the filter by gravity a slow sand filter can reduce turbidity by about 95 viruses by 1 log removal value lrv bacteria by 2 lrv and protozoa by 2 lrv granular activated carbon gac filter can remove dissolved organic carbon doc and natural organic material by adsorption this method has been used for many years 64 gac filtration is also used for removing natural organic material odour and unpleasant taste 65 naddeo et al 66 mentioned that gac can reduce turbidity by 59 7 e coli by 67 9 220 cfu 100 ml and total coliform tc by 59 8 91 cfu 100 ml there are other filtration methods such as nylon cloth can be used for very basic filtration which has been found to be effective in reducing turbidity in water and spreading diarrhea in rural communities in bangladesh 56 it has a mesh size of 150 μm and can reduce about 2 log units of cholera bacteria dual media which is a combination of sand and gac media 67 can remove e coli from urban water by about 63 2 lrv 0 43 68 however its performance varies with season which means that during rainy season efficacy of e coli reduction is smaller than in dry season 8 hence they strongly recommended disinfecting dual media filtered water tables 8 and 9 summarises the advantages and disadvantages of various types of filters 4 2 disinfection methods disinfection is necessary to deactivate bacteria pathogens and various harmful micro organism in full extent to make the water fit for drinking 59 the authors further suggested several effective disinfection methods for rainwater which include chlorination by tablets liquid chlorination ultraviolet and solar disinfection 4 2 1 chlorination chlorination is quite common and it is easy to disinfect raw rainwater with it however there are few issues needing attention for example chlorine should be applied in the pipe or mixing tank rather than in storage tank because it may react with organic matter and settle at bottom of storage tank 71 according to helmreich 2009 to kill germs properly the free chlorine concentration should be 0 4 to 0 5 mg l at least for 15 min sources of chlorine could be chlorine tablet chlorine gas or hypochlorite solution the dose rate varies according to the chlorine demand of the water from various research it is found that filtration can reduce total organic carbon toc or natural organic matter nrm in water which can contribute to reduced chlorine demand wilhelm et al 72 mentioned that for higher turbidity in water more chlorine is needed the disadvantage of chlorination is that it is not effective on some protozoa such as cryptosporidium and giardia additionally it can create by products that could be harmful 4 2 2 ultraviolet disinfection ultraviolet disinfection method can also be used to disinfect rainwater when dna and rna of micro organisms absorb the uv light their dna and rna structure changes that stops them to regenerate i e they are unable to cause diseases despite their metabolically alive state the main advantage of uv system is that it can be effective for killing protozoa such as cryptosporidium and giardia and it does not produce any by products like chlorination craik et al 73 mentioned that both low and medium level uv radiation can make cryptosporidium effectively inactive the disadvantage is that there is no recontamination protection after the disinfection 74 the microbiological recontamination can happen shortly after the disinfection if the treated water is left in the tank or jar for a longer time 4 2 3 thermal pasteurisation disinfection disinfection can also be done through thermal pasteurisation where water is heated at 50 c to 70 c at this temperature the heat can kill micro organisms or make them inactive the most common and cost effective method in rural areas is boiling water by wood fire 75 4 2 4 solar disinfection in solar disinfection water is heated by sunlight 69 the water is stored in a bottle or container and then left in the sun it is very cost effective and very popular where the sun light is strong the water temperature in the container can reach to about 60 c many micro organisms become inactive due to sunlight and generated heat 76 these authors also found that solar collectors can provide better performance than just solar disinfection but the main disadvantage with this disinfection process is that it cannot be done at night time and on rainy days therefore it is effective where sunlight intensity is high such as africa some countries in asia and other countries where sunlight is available most of the time of the year the disadvantage of this method is that it does not offer recontamination protection like chlorination 4 2 5 boiling boiling of water with the help of fuel is an ancient and common method of disinfection 75 these authors identified that in most of the rural areas source of fire is wood the wood fire which is used to boil water over 55 c kills and makes most of the water borne micro organisms such as pathogenic bacteria viruses helminths and protozoa inactive in rural areas in kenya it was found that when the boiling temperature reached 70 c coliforms were reduced up to 70 there are several disadvantages such as boiling water by fire is linked to smoke greenhouse gas emission and reduction of the forest area table 10 compares various disinfection methods 5 benefit of pre treatment of harvested rainwater in the 1970s some researchers expressed concerns on health risks due to disinfection by products dbp it was identified that trihalomethanes thm have potential health effects which is a by product of chlorination 77 in malaysia halogenated organic contaminants were found in drinking water supplies due to chemical reactions between chlorine and other contaminants chemical species and organic materials according to this study dbp is not expected to be present in drinking water because they are teratogens mutagens carcinogens and toxic it is more advantageous if filtration is done before disinfection pre treatment such as first flush sedimentation and filtration can reduce solids natural organic matters and total organic carbon this will reduce the contaminant load used in disinfection 69 if it is uv system less intensity is required for chlorination chlorine demand is reduced 72 for sodis less sunlight intensity and less duration in sunlight are required for low turbidity or treated water sodium hypo is to be dosed at the rate of 1 88 mg l and for untreated water sodium hypo is to be dosed at the rate of 3 75 mg l 72 burch and thomas 1998 analysed and compared the advantages and disadvantages among different domestic water harvesting treatment methods roughing filter consisting of fine gravel and coarse sand and slow sand filter was noted to be a cost effective option in villages subject to low cost labour they added that chlorine and uv are also relatively less costly but they are less effective in high turbidity hence pre treatment is needed to get a better outcome for chlorination supply should be uninterrupted and whoever operates the chlorine treatment system would require training on the other hand uv treatment is relatively simple compared to chlorination it could be potentially powered by photo voltage pv and has less storage cost as it can be operated as per demand but it requires the facility of accessing spare parts and necessary maintenance services from both village and household perspectives solar pasteurisation treatment may be very attractive as the associated treatment and maintenance costs are very low the main drawback of this method is it is not effective during wintertime from analysis by clasen et al 75 it is clear that treatment cost is higher on household scale compared to village scale the authors noted the costs of treatment per person are chlorination cost 0 66 person filtration cost 3 03 person solar disinfection cost 0 63 person and flocculation disinfection cost 4 95 person according to li et al 78 in ireland during 2009 the general cost for a domestic rwh system was 1500 to 4000 if storage capacity is 1500 l to 10 000 l the expected electricity consumption is 1 kwh a day the cost to build a storage tank in africa differs notably from any european country helmreich and horn 2009 mentioned that a 2 m3 tank could cost 20 to 30 and for a 20 m3 tank it could be 120 to 140 6 challenges in selecting a disinfection method ahmed et al 79 and hamilton et al 18 found that people can be exposed to harmful pathogens such as salmonella inva giardia lamblia legionella pneumophila mip and campylobacter jejuni mapa genes by consuming untreated harvested rainwater uhrw through a ingestion by drinking uhrw regularly 2 ingestion by accident during hosing or other outdoor activities by using uhrw and 3 aerosol ingestion during shower regularly with uhrw water therefore it is prudent to treat rainwater in such a way that the quantity of micro organisms in the uhrw can be reduced below the threat level a number of techniques have been developed to treat uhrw 79 however adoption of these techniques depends on several factors awareness of communities quality of domestic harvested rainwater turbidity presence of chemical species and micro organisms economical state of the community local labour cost available infrastructure in the respective area or community number of people consuming rainwater storage capacity of rainwater tank climatethe area sanitation practices of the community and prevention of micro organism appearance in post treated water during storage period 7 challenges in chlorination at a domestic scale naddeo et al 66 suggested that instead of chlorine gas a liquid hypochlorite solution is preferable because it is less hazardous and easy to distribute to rural communities however other disinfection methods can be applicable at a domestic level hypochlorite can be effective if cryptosporidium and giardia are not present in the uhrw however avoiding recontamination after post treatment chlorination can be a better option than any other disinfection method as during chlorination total and free chlorine residuals can reduce the risk of recontamination 69 alekal et al 13 pointed out the significant challenges for chlorination at a small scale as follows complexity of mixing chemical inconvenience of storing chemical deterioration of water quality parameters in terms of taste and odour inability to remove two strong water borne micro organisms which are cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and giardia lamblia cysts 8 chlorine demand calculation according to who the recommended c t value is 15 mg l min who 2011 which means effective disinfection by chlorination can be achieved at 0 5 mg l free chlorine concentration for 30 min australian drinking water guidelines follow the same principle australian drinking water guidelines 6 2011 version 3 5 updated august 2018 based on the above guideline from the drinking water storage tank to the tap the minimum free chlorine must be 0 5 mg l burch and thomas 69 acknowledged that identifying the right amount of dosing chlorine and maintaining suitable residual chorine level before ingestion is a very complex procedure however to determine a hypochlorite storage facility with an automatic dosing system it is useful to predict chlorine demand researchers have identified various ways of calculating chlorine demand as noted below 9 chlorine decay method as chlorine is a non selective oxidant it reacts with both organic and inorganic chemicals species the reaction rate varies depending on the nature of the species chlorine decay in bulk water can be calculated based on either a first order or second order kinetics 15 first order chlorine concentration decay can be expressed by 1 c t c 0 exp kt c t is the chlorine concentration at time t c 0 is the initial chlorine concentration and k is first order decay constant this formula considers only chlorine fading in the water and does not consider other reactants with which it may react with boccelli et al 14 considered both chlorine decay and the reactants that react with chlorine as chlorine demand furthermore warton et al 15 plotted initial chlorine concentration against chlorine concentration after a period of time t they plotted chlorine decay in 5 min to 4 h and 4 h to 168 h and developed the following equation 2 c 0 a b exp d t warton et al 15 also developed another equation to predict the required chlorine dose to achieve desired chlorine concentration 3 c 0 e f c t here f is the slope of the linear function and e is the y intercept the values of e and f are specific for a given time t hence it is clear from the above three equations that chlorine decay can be presented by linear equations if the initial chlorine concentration is known the chlorine concentration can be predicted after a certain period besides linear formulae there are models which can predict chlorine doses 80 9 1 chlorine demand calculation from by product formation besides the linear formula as noted above two more models can be used for predicting chlorine demand which is the trihalomethanes thm model and chlorine demand model abdullah et al 80 9 2 chlorine demand model abdullah et al 80 suggested that ammonia in the water can influence the chlorine demand they commented that ammonia reacts with chlorine and form chloramine they developed a regression equation with three independent variables ph suva and ammonia 4 chlorine demand a ph b suva c ammonia d where a 101 614 b 0 216 c 0 237 d 0 576 thm model 5 thm a chlorine dosage b suva c ph d where a 10 1 783 b 0 663 c 0 227 d 0 478 from the analysis it was found that in terms of prediction accuracy the chlorine demand thm model is associated with less error than the chlorine demand model 80 10 discussion in australia roof harvested rainwater rhrw is a primary source of drinking water in many rural households surprisingly in a capital city like adelaide some residents preferred rhrw over mains water 81 the limited knowledge about the water quality between mains water and rhrw and taste are the primary reasons for this choice but in rural areas the reasons to prefer rhrw above supplied water are different than those in big cities which are economic disadvantage poor water quality absence of water supply from municipality although people s perception of rainwater is pure in reality it is not the case in most instances water is contaminated by various sources while saved in a storage tank the contaminants are either chemicals or microbiological or a combination of both the sample data from various researchers indicate that the location surrounding environment and type of catchments can dictate the type of contaminants in the harvested rainwater 19 this variation of contaminants in the harvested rainwater samples at different countries and cities is evident in tables 1 and 5 it is also noticed in table 2 that harmful chemical contaminants such as lead cadmium and arsenic have been detected in harvested rainwater at unacceptable concentrations long term ingestion of this type of untreated rhrw can harm multiple organs in the human body refer to table 4 furthermore according to table 6 rhrw contains harmful micro organisms such as fecal coliform e coli and enterococci at significant concentrations which can pose a potential risk of a local pandemic therefore rhrw treatment is indispensable to retain public health in both remote and metropolitan cities among many of the previously discussed treatment methods it is found that filtration is very effective against chemical contaminants and effective against microbiological organisms to a great extent among all the low cost filters refer table 6 ceramic filter is the best performed filtration method in terms of removing micro organism besides micro organism log reduction value removing odour and maintaining taste are also important factors in choosing a filtration method in this context dual media is the preferred option compared to the ceramic filter as it has got both sand and granular activated carbon as filter media which reduce germs and odour and maintain good taste in the filtered water 67 82 on many occasions rhrw consumers filter their water before consumption however little evidence of the disinfection of rhrw was found after the filtration table 6 shows that germs remaining in rwrh after filtration and micro organisms are removed partially in india macdonald et al 8 found that after filtration remaining organic carbon and activated micro organisms can grow and contaminate while rhrw is stored and that is why for drinking purposes australian drinking water guideline has emphasised disinfection disinfection can work mostly against the germs such as bacteria viruses and protozoa however burch and thomas 69 suggested filtering water prior to implementing disinfection to enhance disinfection efficiency potential high turbidity in rhrw can undermine disinfection effectiveness they further confirmed that filtration improves disinfection performance significantly this review paper refer table 9 compares advantages and disadvantages among various disinfection methods subject to consumer s financial capability availability of disinfectants type of micro organisms in rhrw and surrounding environmental factors largely dictate the selection of the best disinfection method senevirathna et al 2 designed an ultraviolet uv system with a granular activated carbon gac filter which was found to be cost effective however this system would need consistent power supply uv lamps and technical support to build such a system furthermore people with limited financial means may not be able to afford a uv disinfection system at home among other disinfection methods solar disinfection is another effective and cost effective one for remote and low income areas 69 since it is impossible to get sufficient sunlight consistently throughout the year it may not be a good choice in most situations furthermore boiling water is also a low cost and popular disinfection method like solar disinfection the high temperature makes germs inactive for a certain period but the fuel source can be challenging on many occasions such as remote areas underdeveloped countries desert locations and wet seasons moreover it can cause pollution to environment and reduce the forest area mintz et al 11 12 and sobsey et al 10 suggested that chlorination is another disinfection method that is widely used and cost effective in a commercial context but not well developed and popular in domestic cases 13 burch and thomas 69 presented the cost and effectiveness of various treatment methods they also compared various combinations of different filtration and disinfection methods as summarised in table 11 the recent cost data are also included in the table to show a comparison about cost reduction over the time as we can see that the system cost has been decreased substantially with time considering the effectiveness and residual disinfection chlorination and rough filter gravel and fine sand media combination is found to be preferable to other methods however there are also other types of filters such as dual media filter ceramic filter and cloth filter which can be combined with various disinfection methods to verify their effectiveness from the above discussion it is understood that chlorination has a unique advantage which is residual effectiveness that no other disinfection method can provide as chlorinated water can be stored longer than any other treated water it can also be a potential disinfection method for domestic purposes however no standard system that runs automatically has been found which can be used to disinfect harvested rainwater by chlorination at a small scale therefore there is an opportunity to develop an automatic chlorination system for application at the individual household level the challenging issues in designing a chlorination device for small scale applications include predicting chlorine demand and determining the appropriate dose rate 11 conclusions rainwater harvesting rwh is an ancient practice of storing water for subsequent use recently this has received wider attention as an alternative fresh water source in urban areas rainwater is used in an effort to reduce the demand for mains water however harvested rainwater is used for potable and nonpotable purposes in most rural areas of australia and other countries people generally perceive roof harvested rainwater as clean and safe for drinking without any formal treatment however in this literature review it is found that rainwater is not safe to drink without treatment there are several treatment methods that can be implemented in treating the roof harvested rainwater though large scale filtration is a widely accepted water treatment method the effectiveness of filtration systems at a domestic scale in terms of quality and economic viability has rarely been investigated also the requirement of disinfection and the method of disinfection at a domestic scale is still a topic of discussion and further research therefore the aim of this review was to investigate how a domestic rainwater harvesting system can be used safely to produce potable water the major findings of this review are the followings o filtered rainwater followed by disinfection needs protection from recontamination after being stored for an extended period o hypochlorite could be very effective in delaying bacteria regrowth however on a domestic scale it is not adopted due to multiple limitations more research works are required to overcome these to develop a hypochlorite based domestic disinfection system o an efficient automatic disinfection system by sodium hypochlorite requires both chlorine demand measurements and optimum chlorine dose rate however as the roof harvested rainwater catchment materials and surrounding environments are non uniform it is complex to calculate chlorine demand and dosage at smaller scale applications o the chlorine decay model is more straightforward than the chlorine demand model for calculating chlorine demand o toc contributes to creating cdbp in water treatment process nonetheless not much data are available regarding toc in domestic harvested rainwater in australia o further research is required to configure an automatic rainwater treatment systems that would produce drinking water for consumers at household level which can be widely embraced in rural areas credit
