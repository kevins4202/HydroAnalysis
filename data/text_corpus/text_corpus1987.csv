9935,water shortage and serious soil salinization are two general features in arid regions crop models can provide constructive suggestions for scientific soil water salt regulations in the study an ecohydrological crop model waves the water vegetation energy and solute model was employed to examine the crop responses to soil water salt dynamics in a severely dry and saline region of southern xinjiang china observation data of film mulched cotton with the initial soil salinity of 7 19 9 80 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 56 2 12 ds m 1 were collected in 2009 and 2010 with five different irrigation water salinity treatments 0 11 05 g l 1 ec of 0 11 85 ds m 1 results showed that the relative absolute errors of simulated soil water and salt were less than 4 1 and 12 4 in 2010 calibration and 11 1 and 13 2 in 2009 validation the coefficient of determination of yield in calibration and validation was 0 93 and 0 74 respectively simulated dynamics indicated soil salt accumulation at a depth of 40 cm results of scenario analysis showed that crop water productivity was the highest when the total irrigation volume was 275 325 mm in all scenarios saline water with a certain degree of salinity can be used for irrigation without causing a severe yield reduction 20 reduction this study provided a scientific basis for water management in areas with severe drought and salinization keywords crop model salt stress cotton growth crop water productivity saline water irrigation 1 introduction the continuous growth of the world s population coupled with climate change puts forward new and higher requirements for the global food and fiber supply agricultural development still faces many challenges to keep up with the demand at present agricultural water use accounts for the largest proportion of total water use with the proportion even greater than 90 in some countries and the fresh water resources available for irrigation agriculture are increasingly scarce aquastat 2016 on the other hand inappropriate agricultural practices lead to land degradation with the enhancement of soil salinization soil degradation caused by salinization is deteriorating agricultural practices at an alarming rate 20 of the irrigated land were salt affected soils fao 2021 soil salinization has increasingly become a serious problem affecting global agricultural production and sustainability of land resources especially in arid and semi arid areas salinity along with drought makes agricultural development more difficult mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 management of water and salt is crucial to the sustainable agriculture in arid areas and crop model is an important tool for understanding the interactions between salt and water in order to develop sustainable water and salt management plans though current mainstream crop models have taken into account salt stress factors including swap ben asher et al 2006 jiang et al 2016 kumar et al 2015 hydrus phogat et al 2020 ramos et al 2011 unsatchem rasouli et al 2012 saltmed alkhasha and al omran 2019 chauhdary et al 2020 aquacrop kumar et al 2014 tan et al 2018 apsim radanielson et al 2018 zeng et al 2016 and waves zhang et al 1999a limited studies were conducted under severely saline condition there are no consistent criteria and authoritative standards for the classifications of salinization at present and different units were used to quantify the level of salinization generally soil is considered to be severely saline as soil salt content ssc g kg 1 is greater than 6 g kg 1 or electrical conductivity of soil water saturated paste ece ds m 1 is greater than 16 ds m 1 or electrical conductivity of soil water 1 5 extract paste ec1 5 ds m 1 is greater than 1 56 ds m 1 u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 gao et al 2011 zaman et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 taking the widely used model swap for example only 2 out of 29 researches about salinization were conducted under severely saline condition qureshi et al 2013 su et al 2005 the limited applications of crop models under severe salinization conditions may be related to the fact that those areas are not commonly used for farming because fewer crops are tolerant to high salinity levels allen et al 1998 salt tolerant crops such as cotton and barley are widely planted in moderate and severely saline area and great economic benefits are produced xinjiang is a typical severe salinization area in the arid northwest china and 32 of the arable land is affected by salinity yang et al 2019 up to 1 279 000 ha and 22 1 of the salinity affected area is severely saline cultivated land luo et al 2001 cotton production in xinjiang accounted for 87 3 of the total production of china in 2020 national bureau of statistics of the prc currently crop models considering crop response to water and salt stress are rarely studied in xinjiang tan et al 2018 simulated cotton growth and water salt dynamic using the aquacrop model in korla of southern xinjiang however the r2 the coefficient of determination of salinity was only 0 01 0 2 tan et al 2018 so crop modeling with appropriate parameters to conform with the local production practice is urgently needed for the water salt management in arid saline areas furthermore in the models mentioned above the crop responses to water salt coupling stress are mostly based on empirical relationships and are mainly in two different combinations of water stress and salt stress functions one assumes that the combined effect of water stress and salt stress are additive whereas the other assumes that they are multiplicative oster et al 2012 the combined matric and osmotic effects in waves model adopts an integrated rate methodology irm wu et al 1994 for multi factor growth rate modeling which is a semi empirical and semi mechanical methods irm is a procedure for constructing a single growth multiplier equation that integrates multiple environmental factors affecting plant growth into a number between zero and one the irm method is different from the empirical expressions above and is an effective attempt to relate crop growth rate to abiotic stress zhang et al 1999a used the waves model to simulate the growth of alfalfa and soil water salt dynamics under different scenarios of groundwater level 60 and 100 cm below the soil surface and groundwater salinity ec of 0 1 and 16 ds m 1 the results were in good agreement with the measurements however the salt module of the waves model still lacks validation and application in more areas e g areas with severe salinization and on more crops e g cotton taking all these factors together the objectives of this paper are to 1 evaluate the performance of waves model in the extremely dry and serious salinization region 2 simulate soil water and salt dynamics cotton growth and yield response under saline water irrigation conditions using the calibrated waves model and 3 optimize total irrigation volume and the threshold of irrigation water salinity under different scenarios the results are expected to provide a scientific basis for water and salt management of cotton farmland in arid and saline areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design the study was conducted from 2009 to 2010 at aksu national field research station of agro ecosystems 80 51 e longitude 40 37 n latitude altitude 1028 m xinjiang uygur autonomous region china the station is in the warm temperate zone with an arid climate the annual average temperature precipitation relative humidity sunshine hours pan evaporation and solar radiation are 11 3 45 7 mm 48 2948 h 2500 mm and 6000 mj m 2 respectively hu et al 2013 zhao et al 2010 low precipitation and strong evaporation make the area extremely arid the rainfall during the growth period was 62 3 and 67 3 mm in 2009 and 2010 the groundwater table at the station fluctuated within 0 54 3 04 m in 2009 2010 the predominant soil textures at this site are silty loam 25 4 sand 69 4 silt and 5 3 clay the average bulk density along the 1 m soil profile is 1 48 g cm 3 the saturated water content is 0 48 cm3 cm 3 the experiment was carried out in non weighing lysimeters with the sealed bottom 1 7 m height 2 m width and 2 5 m length the soil filled in the lysimeter was taken from the nearby saline land the salinity level of the soil before sowing was 7 19 9 80 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 56 2 12 ds m 1 which was classified as the severely saline soil gao et al 2011 the crop was cotton of the variety zhongmian 49 with drip irrigation under transparent film mulching the experimental site was surrounded by the cotton field freshwater surface water about 150 mm with a low salinity concentration of 0 46 g l 1 ec of 0 77 ds m 1 in 2009 and 0 35 g l 1 ec of 0 59 ds m 1 in 2010 was applied to provide necessary moisture before sowing no irrigation was applied at seedling stage to promote deeper root system and avoid spindling growth the first irrigation was applied in the budding period 21 6 2009 12 6 2010 with surface water to maintain plant vitality afterwards different irrigation treatments with saline water were applied and the detailed information was listed in table 1 saline water was a mix of saline drainage water and surface water and the ion composition of one sample was presented in table 2 the salt content per unit volume of water cw g l 1 was converted to electrical conductivity ec ds m 1 of water using the following equation 1 ec 18 45 e 0 09298 c w 18 45 r 2 0 99 52 samples the salinity level of the drainage water was 31 70 g l 1 ec of 17 48 ds m 1 in 2009 and 31 32 g l 1 ec of 17 45 ds m 1 in 2010 five treatments were arranged in a complete randomized design with three replications in a total of 15 lysimeters the irrigation schedule was shown in table 1 during the growing season 350 kg hm 2 of urea and 150 kg hm 2 of potassium dihydrogen phosphate were applied with water through drip irrigation other agronomic measures were carried out according to local experience the meteorological data including precipitation temperature sunshine hours and solar radiation were collected by an automatic weather station inside the experiment site soil samples were taken every 15 days during the growing season at depths of 5 15 25 35 50 and 70 cm for soil water electrical conductivity ec1 5 ds m 1 determination which was measured on 1 5 extracts for soil and water by weight the salt content in the soil solution c ss g l 1 was determined from ec1 5 following approach of xu et al 2013 first the soil salt content ssc g kg 1 was empirically related to ec1 5 as follows 2 ssc 4 6126ec1 5 r2 0 96 517 soil samples then the c ss was obtained on the basis of soil water content θ cm3 cm 3 ssc and bulk density γ g cm 3 using the equation 3 c ss ssc γ θ soil water content was measured once a week by the neutron probe at depths of 10 30 50 and 70 cm and the measurement of soil water content was also taken before and after the irrigation and rainfall events the neutron probe was calibrated by measured soil water content using the gravimetric method the leaf area index lai was measured only in 2010 with the assistance of a ci 110 plant canopy digital imager cotton yield lint for each plot was measured at harvest by hand harvesting with three replications the root samples were extracted by the root auger and root distribution was measured by hp 4850 scanner and delta t scan results showed that most of the root was distributed in the depth of 0 80 cm hu et al 2013 tan et al 2018 also fixed the soil depth at 80 cm within which all the water salt dynamics could be captured 2 2 model description the model used in this study is waves the water vegetation energy and solute model which was developed by csiro in 1993 dawes and short 1993 zhang and dawes 1998 zhang et al 1996 waves is a process based model at a daily time step and strikes a good balance between complexity usefulness and accuracy of prediction in energy water carbon and solute processes in a one dimensional soil canopy atmosphere system waves has been widely tested and applied in the field to simulate soil water budget and evapotranspiration et cheng et al 2014 gharun et al 2018 tian et al 2017 crop growth and yield kang et al 2003 wang et al 2001 groundwater recharge barron et al 2012 crosbie et al 2013 silberstein et al 2013 and water and carbon balance gharun et al 2018 silberstein et al 2013 in waves the infiltration of net rainfall and irrigation and soil water movement along the soil profile is simulated using a fully finite difference numerical solution of the richards equation as showed in eq 4 salt transport is obtained by solving convection dispersion equation as eq 5 assuming the solute is conservative

solute in the soil m2 s 1 waves considers osmotic potential to represent salt stress which can be obtained from the linear conversion of solute concentration as in eq 6 as for the coupling stress of water and salt it mainly reflects in two processes firstly waves simulates the impact of salt on carbon assimilation as in eqs 7 8 using an integrated rate method irm wu et al 1994 which is based on saturation rate kinetics the mathematical foundation of irm can be viewed as a generalization of michaelis menten kinetics to multiple substrates simply understood as an analogy with a parallel resistance network here a potential growth rate a max is determined which represents the maximum growth rate under the optimum condition a multiplier between 0 and 1 is applied based on the availability of environmental factors including water and salt this multiplier combines several biochemical and biophysical processes in an empirical relationship allowing for various processes and their interaction to be dealt with simultaneously besides it s easy to take into account other factors for example mccallum et al 2010 slightly modified waves model by considering the atmosphere of co2 availability of water varies with osmotic potential changes as in eq 8 salt stress has a negative effect on the availability of water and furthermore reduces carbon assimilation in other words as crop growth and carbon assimilation are closely related crop growth like lai and biomass formation above and below ground will slow down in the presence of salt and ultimately et and yield are affected 6 π 2 c r t 7 a a max 1 ω w ω n 1 η t χ l ω w χ w ω n χ n 1 exp klai dl 43200 8 χ w 1 φ m w osm π ψ wilt where π is the osmotic potential m c is the molarity of solute in the soil water mol m

factor ψ wilt is the water potential at the wilting point m on the other hand salt stress affects the rate of root water absorption and its distribution in each layer as in eqs 9 13 in other words roots are able to adjust for water uptake accordingly the potential crop transpiration λ e c is calculated by a big leaf application of the penman monteith pm formula as in eq 9 one of its parameters crop resistance is linked to water availability as in eq 10 with considering the salt stress the amount of water absorbed by roots is distributed by the magnitude of water potential and root biomass in each layer of the root zone as showed in eqs 10 13 osmotic potential affects water potential and finally affects distribution of water extraction in each layer 9 λ e c r nc ρ c p vpd r ac γ 1 r wc

dynamically allocated from daily production as shown in eqs 14 16 waves model provides two methods to calculate final yield kang et al 2003 one is to multiply the accumulated above ground biomass by harvest index in the second method final yield is estimated by assuming a linear relationship between relative crop transpiration and production in this paper the latter method was adopted in yield

simulations the soil profile was divided into 40 layers and the surface layer was densified to capture the drastic water and salt changes the upper boundary condition was cauchy boundary condition determined by the irrigation and precipitation fluxes the evaporation e and transpiration t rates the bottom boundary condition was defined as a zero flux boundary condition because of the sealed bottom of the lysimeters the simulation period was from may 1 to october 13 day of year 121 286 in 2009 and may 11 to october 11 day of year 131 284 in 2010 covering the full growing season the parameters in the model consist of meteorological soil and crop parameters the meteorological parameters were obtained from the meteorological station at the site the soil parameters mainly the soil hydraulic properties were retrieved and adjusted manually to achieve good agreement between measured soil water content and water potential here we divided the soil into three layers and set the k c hydraulic conductivity at a very low value as 0 001 m day in the surface layer 0 0 002 m considering the mulching effect other soil parameters were shown in table 3 lines 26 30 there are various crop parameters in the waves model and a sensitivity analysis was carried out firstly to determine the most sensitive parameters in this study the sobol method sobol 2001 was used and the global sensitivity factor of 21 crop parameters were quantified fig 1 five model outputs including the e t et yield and biomass were analyzed according to the uncertain inputs overall there were 9 parameters that had a relatively large global sensitivity coefficient which indicated they had a greater impact on the outputs the 9 parameters were salt sensitivity factor maximum production rate accumulated temperature requirements optimum growth temperature semi optimum growth temperature above ground partitioning factor light extinction coefficient crop factor and soil albedo respectively among them salt sensitivity factor had the largest global sensitivity denoting that the model was sensitive to salt stress the soil albedo mainly affected e and the crop factor only affected the yield the remaining insensitive parameters were determined based on the measured or empirical values from literature there were more observations in 2010 so the data in 2010 were used for model calibration and the data in 2009 were used for verification the 9 sensitive parameters were calibrated against observed data in 2010 using the shuffled complex evolution sce ua duan et al 1994 which has been widely used for calibration of hydrological model parameters the objective functions in sce ua of soil moisture and soil salinity were optimized simultaneously with equal weights and crop parameters that affect yield were subsequently calibrated the crop parameters after calibration were shown in table 3 all the calibrated parameters were within their feasible ranges they were different from other c3 crop parameters recommended by zhang and dawes 1998 prior to this waves hasn t been used for simulating the growth of cotton in this study the parameters of waves were determined on the specific crop of cotton in the extremely dry and serious salinization area which would provide a reference for the future work 2 4 performance evaluation statistical indices including the coefficient of determination r2 mean of absolute error mae relative mean absolute error mre root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used for model evaluation they are defined by the following equations 17 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 18 mae i 1 n o i s i n 19 mre i 1 n o i s i o i 100 n 20 rmse i 1 n o i s i 2 n 21 nse 1 i

observations the closer r2 and nse values are to 1 0 the model accuracy is higher when nse is close to 0 it means that the simulation results are close to the average level of the observed values that is the overall results are credible but the process simulation error is large if nse is far less than 0 the model is not credible when mae mre and rmse equal to the value of 0 the maximum agreement achieves 2 5 scenario simulations and analyses optimized farmland management requires knowledge of the yield response water consumption and water productivity in different scenarios considering the heterogeneity of soil moisture and salinity and the management practice different scenarios in this study included different initial soil water contents of 0 25 0 30 0 35 and 0 40 cm3 cm 3 initial soil salt contents of 7 0 7 5 8 0 8 5 9 0 9 5 and 10 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 52 1 63 1 73 1 84 1 95 2 06 and 2 17 ds m 1 irrigation water salinity of 0 5 10 15 and 20 g l 1 ec of 0 6 86 11 17 13 88 and 15 58 ds m 1 and total irrigation volumes of 200 500 mm gradient 25 mm the scenario simulations assumed that the initial soil water and salt content were evenly distributed along the profile the rainfall during the growth period in 2010 was 67 3 mm which was slightly higher than the multi year average of 62 2 mm since 2010 http data cma cn the interannual variability of other meteorological factors was small e g temperature therefore 4 7 5 13 1820 scenarios of the different combinations of the 4 key variables i e initial soil water content initial soil salt content salinity of irrigation water and total irrigation volume were simulated based on the meteorological data and irrigation schedule in 2010 2 6 crop water productivity after analysis was made in the scenario prediction crop water productivity wp c was estimated using eq 22 as follow 22 wp c y et where wp c is crop water productivity kg m 3 y is the lint yield kg ha 1 et is the crop evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 during the growing season 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance 3 1 1 soil water content goodness of fit test indices of soil water content in 2010 calibration and 2009 validation were shown in table 4 r2 of all the treatments was greater than 0 75 the values of nse were all greater than 0 5 in the calibration the range of mae was 0 009 0 011 cm3 cm 3 the range of rmse was 0 011 0 013 cm3 cm 3 and the mre was less than 4 1 in the validation the range of mae was 0 013 0 028 cm3 cm 3 and the range of rmse was 0 016 0 031 cm3 cm 3 except for the treatment 1 t1 the mre was less than 7 9 although the error was enlarged during validation it was within the acceptable range han et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 these results were comparable with the results of the published studies about the waves model cheng et al 2014 tian et al 2017 zhang et al 1999a overall the simulated soil water content and the measured data is comparable which showed that waves is capable of modeling soil water content in the cotton field fig 2 showed the temporal variation of the simulated average soil water content the trend of the simulated moisture was consistent with the measurement both in calibration 2010 and validation 2009 especially good matching was observed in calibration as expected from table 4 deviations still existed a closer look of the results indicated that the model underestimated the high soil water content in the initial period day of year 120 170 for both years especially in 2009 this may be attributed to waves s inability to take the film effect into account physically and thus it caused an overestimation of the et and mainly the e minimizing the hydraulic conductivity in the soil surface layer is not enough to fully reflect the mulching effect in the early period i e seeding stage the cotton canopy was very small and the evaporation was dominant when the film effect was neglected the large bare soil was open to the atmosphere with extremely strong evaporation and e was great and overestimated considerably li et al 2013 this resulted an obvious simulated deviation in the early stage and smaller simulated values of soil water content than the measurement as the canopy developed simulation errors decreased in addition the pm formula was generally considered to be suitable for evapotranspiration calculation of the dense canopies lai 2 and the calculation error was larger when the canopy was sparse at the seedling stage lagos et al 2011 tian et al 2017 found that there was also an underestimation of soil water content in the early stage using waves relatively lager deviations were also found between the simulated and measured values at the later stages of t1 and t2 in 2009 which may be caused by the errors in the initial water storage considering sufficient irrigation was applied before sowing the initial soil moisture content below 1 3 m was set to be near saturation based on experience however in t1 and t2 in 2009 the water content in the deep layer may not reach saturation the inconsistency leads to an overestimation of the upward water supply in the later stage and thus the simulated moisture was greater than the observation 3 1 2 soil water salinity table 5 shows the statistical indexes between the simulated and measured salt concentration r2 of all the treatments was all greater than 0 5 except for t5 in 2010 with the value of 0 49 in calibration 2010 mae and mre were 6 40 7 30 g l 1 and 11 0 12 4 respectively in validation 2009 mae and mre were 3 34 8 07 g l 1 and 5 9 13 2 the simulated error was on the lower side of the range reported by tan et al 2018 hassanli et al 2016 and jiang et al 2011 however compared with mre of the soil water content the results for salinity were larger the explanation was that waves model establishes the convection dispersion equation based on the solution of the richards equation as most models do and thus the simulated moisture error will be added to the salt modeling hao et al 2015 in addition this may be attributed to the fact that there were limited measured points and the soil sampling sites were different at each time meanwhile the soil salt content itself had a great spatial variability soil water and salt transport parameters had large spatial variability verma et al 2012 but waves used a set of unified parameters to simplify the complex systems as most models do moreover the model didn t consider the effects of crop absorption of ion these may all contributed to the simulated error fig 3 described the temporal variation of soil water salinity the simulated soil salinity profiles were broadly consistent with measured soil salinity profiles though there was bias as illustrated in fig 3 the salt concentration was slightly underestimated in validation 2009 and in the early stage of calibration 2010 but it was overestimated in the later stage of 2010 in order to check the source of the error in the salt concentration simulation the temporal variation of treatments t1 and t5 in 2009 was plotted in fig 4 it can be seen that simulated result of the surface layer 5 cm depth had the largest error followed by the layer of 15 cm depth while the simulated values in deeper layers matched well with the measured data after irrigation the simulated salinity in the surface layer at a depth of 5 cm decreased rapidly and was lower than the measurements in the middle growth stages mainly in the flowering and boll stage the increasing trend of the simulated surface salt concentration was not obvious and much smaller than the measured data after each irrigation event the high complexity of the upper boundary conditions may be the cause of reduced accuracy in the surface salt simulation jiang et al 2016 the film effect in the surface evaporation and water movement may also influence the simulation accuracy of the surface salt which needs a further study zheng et al 2009 in summary the underestimation of salinity in the surface layer for most treatments may explain the slightly underestimated salinity in fig 3 in the later growth period of 2010 day of year 230 280 the salinity was overestimated but the simulation matched well with the last measurement october 29 which indicated that a consistent change trend of the model simulation the deviation may be caused by systematic errors in salinity measurement 3 1 3 crop growth and yield the measurements and simulations of lai in 2010 were shown in fig 5 the mae was 0 19 cm2 cm 2 the model can grasp the basic characteristics of the development of the lai the simulated maximum value was between 1 65 and 2 5 cm2 cm 2 which is lower than some published data of cotton lai up to 5 cm2 cm 2 gao et al 2019 soil salt content may greatly affect canopy growth and similar lai result was found in xinjiang with an average soil salinity of 6 07 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 32 ds m 1 within 1 0 m root depth ning et al 2013 moreover the differences may be related to cotton variety geographical location irrigation amount and so on the simulated lai curve was a unimodal curve as the same shape of simulated lai zhang et al 1999b produced when the lai developed to the maximum the canopy began to decline at a large rate immediately instead of maintaining at a relatively high lai level and falling down slowly in waves the respiration load was multiplied by 20 to cause the carbon pools to senesce to avoid introducing extra parameters and better describe the life cycle the number of measurements is also supposed to increase for further verifying and modifying the lai simulation in waves model lint yield was presented in fig 6 the simulated and measured data displayed a linear relationship with r2 of 0 93 in calibration 2010 and 0 74 in validation 2009 the mre in calibration and validation was 9 2 and 5 9 respectively the simulation accuracy was similar to previous studies jiang et al 2016 verma et al 2012 the points in fig 6 were a little bit discrete which may be due to the simulation error of the soil moisture content and soil salt content previously mentioned in general the accuracy of yield simulation was acceptable and the waves model can reflect the yield differences between different treatments with saline water irrigation and initial severely saline soil cotton was classified as a salt tolerant plant allen et al 1998 considerable yield was still obtained with the high salinity soil which implied that cotton has a great planting potential how to maximize the growth potential of cotton in the severe salinization soil needs a further study 3 2 simulated dynamics of soil water and salinity 3 2 1 soil water content and et table 6 showed average normalized water availability χ w calculated by eq 8 and also the simulated et and e during the growing period the water availability indicated the intensity of water salt stress total irrigation volume was the same among different treatments thus χ w mainly reflected salt stress the smaller χ w was the stronger stress the crop suffered in general as the salinity of irrigation water increased t1 to t5 which brought more salt into the soil the salt stress was intensified but χ w didn t simply decrease from t1 to t5 with some subtle differences the larger initial soil salinity value of t3 9 8 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 2 12 ds m 1 table 1 leads to a smaller χ w than t4 and t5 in calibration 2010 the same pattern was found during the validation 2009 salt stress was caused by the combined effect of the irrigated saline water and the initial soil salt content waves integrated these two sources of salt stress into a single variable and it was easier for comparison from table 6 when the χ w was smaller and the salt stress intensified crop transpiration reduced as many studies reported ben asher et al 2006 jiang et al 2016 minhas et al 2020 the average values of soil water content in fig 2 showed that the soil moisture gradually decreased at the seedling stage without irrigation and after the regular irrigation started at the budding stage the soil moisture began to fluctuate showing an overall downward trend fig 7 showed the simulated et and e during the growth period it can be seen that et got smaller with smaller χ w for example χ w in t1 of 2010 was the largest and et was the highest accordingly consistent with fig 7 t1 in 2010 had the lowest average soil water content as depicted in fig 2 because more water lost through evapotranspiration from table 6 we can also see that the smaller χ w was the greater the proportion of e to et was it was because when salt stress was strong generally the canopy development was poor with a reduced t and the canopy coverage was at a low level this means that the exposed area increased and e increased minhas et al 2020 with the reduced t and increased e the percentage of e increased the average rate of e et was at a relatively high level of 26 9 which was closer to the result without mulching tian et al 2016 this was mainly due to the fact that the surface resistance was greatly underestimated without considering the mulching effect which led to an overestimation of e the deviation was obvious especially in the early stage of sparse canopy and after irrigation in the early stage more available energy would reach the soil surface and after irrigation a larger amount of water was available for evaporation which resulted in larger errors in both cases the e ratio under film should be less than 20 rosa et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 and this should be modified in the waves model 3 2 2 soil salt content fig 8 showed the spatial and temporal changes of the total soil salt content g kg 1 along different depths during the growth period under saline water irrigation in 2010 similar trend was found in 2009 as shown in fig 8 the soil salt content in the surface layer changed relatively dramatically influenced by irrigation the salt content was the highest at a depth of 40 cm with a tendency of salt accumulation this may be due to the fact that irrigation washed the surface salt down and that salt in the deep layers was transported upwards through evaporation eventually the salt concentrated at the depth around 40 cm the soil salt content was relatively stable at 60 80 cm and the salt content tended to decrease below the soil layer of 80 cm salt in the deep layers during the growing period was continuously transported to the upper layers at the beginning of the growing period the soil salt content was distributed evenly in the soil profile with the highest soil salt content below the depth of 40 cm however by the end of the growing period the soil salt content differed greatly in the soil profile the high salt content layer shifted to shallow layers and the soil salt content reached a fairly high level average 12 34 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 2 68 ds m 1 at 80 cm profile and was 136 157 of the original salt content of the soil profile chen et al 2010 also reported salt accumulation in xinjiang that the average salinity in the 1 0 m soil profile at the end of growing season was 336 and 547 of the original soil profile respectively for electrical conductivity of irrigation water of 3 6 ds m 1 and 6 7 ds m 1 the experiment was conducted in the soil with the ece of 1 15 1 90 ds m 1 not severely saline so there may be differences in soil salt accumulation rate unlike the study of verma et al 2014 which located in the monsoon climate zone it doesn t have abundant rainfall in xinjiang for salt leaching therefore it needs to take the initiative to leach the salt to deep layers before sowing in xinjiang chen et al 2010 suggested that a flood irrigation in the fallow period was much more efficient than applying the same extra amount of water during the growing season 3 3 scenario analysis figs 9 and 10 showed the simulation results with the initial soil water content of 0 35 cm3 cm 3 which indicated an irrigation before sowing was applied and the soil profile water content was close to field capacity scenario simulations were conducted and plots of yield versus irrigation water amount were shown in fig 9 with a given initial soil water content the yield gradually decreased when the irrigation salinity increased when the initial soil salt content increased and other conditions remain the same the yield showed a downward trend as well the results were expected because higher irrigation salinity and initial soil salt content impose a greater osmotic stress on the crop oster et al 2012 shani et al 2005 the yield output showed an increasing trend with the increase of the total irrigation volume enhanced irrigation volume will increase soil water storage that alleviate the salt stress and increase the possibility for leaching salt into deeper layer with further increase of the irrigation amount production growth was slow qureshi et al 2013 reported similar phenomenon in the cotton field for the scenarios with high irrigation amount the yield differences between different irrigation salinity were small it suggested that a feasible measure for making use of the high salinity water was to increase the irrigation volume but at the same time it was necessary to pay attention to the drainage regulation fig 10 showed the changes of wp c which differed with different initial soil salt contents and total irrigation volume when soil salt content was less than or equal to 8 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 73 ds m 1 and the total irrigation volume was less than or equal to 275 mm wp c appeared stable as the total irrigation volume increased wp c started to decline and then gradually stabilized when the soil salt content was higher than 8 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 73 ds m 1 wp c gradually increased as the total irrigation volume increased when the total irrigation volume exceeded 275 mm wp c also showed a downward trend it can be concluded that with the increase of total irrigation volume the increase rates of yield and et were not consistent when there was relatively limited irrigation yield grew faster than et and wp c tended to increase because when the soil salt content was high increased irrigation water can remove the salt in the root zone of cotton and alleviated the water and salt stress to some extent this effect was limited when the total irrigation volume was larger than 275 mm and the increase rate of et exceeded the increase rate of yield production since climate in xinjiang was very dry and the atmospheric evaporation capacity was strong with further increase of total irrigation volume the yield was limited by soil salinity and cotton variety and the potential for yield increasing was small meanwhile the ineffective transpiration increased largely which caused a decrease of wp c in general with the increase of initial soil salt content wp c also gradually decreased the total irrigation volume with wp c reaching its maximum was about 275 300 mm when the objective was to seek a balance between water use and production it was recommended that the irrigation amount in the growing period be controlled around 300 mm if the aim was set to increase yield the irrigation amount could be further increased it s worth mentioning that wp c alone was not enough to identify the best option for irrigation in the field management because the profit function of the production has not been considered in this study fernández et al 2020 it was generally acknowledged that a severe yield reduction occurred when the reduction was greater than 20 the maximum yield was regarded as the optimal yield in this study and the critical value for severe reduction was 2374 kg ha 1 when the initial water content of the soil was 0 35 cm3 cm 3 it can be seen from fig 9 that the management plans for achieving the yield above the horizontal dotted line was applicable to avoid severe yield reduction it could be a reference for the local irrigation practice when the irrigation amount was greater than 475 mm there will be no severe reduction in yield for all scenarios for the initial salt content of the soil of 7 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 52 ds m 1 to avoid severe yield reduction the irrigation amount should be greater than 225 mm in order to get a higher yield it was necessary to irrigate more water or reduce the initial salt content of soil as much as possible it can be estimated that irrigation water with the amount of 275 mm and a salinity less than 2 g l 1 ec of 3 13 ds m 1 fig 9e would help to achieve a balance between saving water and ensuring yield except for the scenarios with soil salt content at 9 5 and 10 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 2 06 and 2 17 ds m 1 from fig 9 and fig 10 it means that wp c reached a fairly large value and no severe reduction occurred in addition as shown in the figure if the amount of irrigation was appropriate saline water with a certain degree of mineralization can be used for irrigation regardless of the initial salt content when the initial soil salt contents are 8 8 5 9 9 5 and 10 kg 1 the amount of irrigation water with a salinity of 5 g l 1 ec of 6 86 ds m 1 greater than 225 275 300 350 and 400 mm respectively can be applied to avoid severe yield reduction increasingly scarce fresh water resources are forcing people to use low quality water for irrigation including the use of saline water for irrigation all over the world huang et al 2012 qadir et al 2007 wang et al 2007 in the plain area of xinjiang saline groundwater with a salinity of 3 5 g l 1 ec of 4 49 6 86 ds m 1 is 44 265 km2 hu et al 2013 in the southern xinjiang the actual development of groundwater resources was only 18 9 li et al 2014 this study indicated that an appropriate amount of saline groundwater could be used in irrigation to alleviate the shortage of freshwater the initial soil water content of 0 25 cm3 cm 3 and the initial salt content of the soil exceeded 8 5 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 84 ds m 1 would directly lead to a severe reduction in production not shown in the figure when the initial salinity of the soil was 8 5 8 0 7 5 and 7 0 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 84 1 73 1 63 and 1 52 ds m 1 the irrigation amount should be equal to or larger than 500 450 375 300 mm respectively to avoid severe yield reduction when the initial soil water content was 0 4 cm3 cm 3 the requirement for irrigation amount and water salinity during the growing period can be correspondingly reduced it can be seen that to ensure a certain initial soil water content was important for the growth of cotton in seedlings and this value should be greater than 0 25 cm3 cm 3 for wp c not shown when the initial water content of the soil was 0 25 0 30 and 0 40 cm3 cm 3 the corresponding irrigation amount for reaching the highest wp c was 325 300 and 275 mm respectively many studies have suggested that the climate in northwest china has gradually become wetter since the 1960 s under the warming background wang et al 2020 thus with the increase of precipitation the irrigation water demand may be correspondingly reduced or yield may increase however the coupling effect of increased temperature and rainfall on cotton growth remains to be further studied to analyze and predict the threshold of sustainability under climate change by considering different future climatic scenarios will be more comprehensive for evaluating the model performance and agricultural development and management for xinjiang and similar areas 4 conclusions the ecohydrological crop model waves was used to simulate the water and salt dynamics cotton growth and yield irrigated with saline water in a typical irrigation district in southern xinjiang with severely dry and serious salinization the main conclusions were as follows 1 the model obtained the dynamic changes of soil water and salt with high accuracy the relative absolute error of soil water content soil salt content and cotton yield were within 11 1 13 2 and 6 0 in validation thus the available crop parameters of waves were generated with acceptable accuracy but the simulation result of soil water content was relatively unsatisfactory in the early growth stage and the simulated salt content in the surface layer also had a discrepancy the poor performance was due to the fact that the effect of film mulching was not able to consider in waves 2 the simulated e et was greater than the theoretical value for neglecting the effects of mulching during the growth period salt accumulated to the shallow layer along with evaporation and the salt accumulation was obvious at the depth of 40 cm 3 scenarios with different initial soil water contents initial salt contents irrigation water salinities and total irrigation volumes were analyzed the results showed that the crop water productivity was the highest when the total amount of irrigation water was 275 325 mm saline water with a certain salinity can be used for irrigation without causing a severe reduction in yield 20 reduction irrigation water with the amount of 275 mm and a salinity less than 2 g l 1 ec of 3 13 ds m 1 would help to achieve a balance between saving water and ensuring yield when soil salt content was less than 9 5 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 2 06 ds m 1 waves model is a process based model that achieves a balance between accuracy and complexity in xinjiang under the severely dry climate and soil salinization further work should be done to consider

9935,water shortage and serious soil salinization are two general features in arid regions crop models can provide constructive suggestions for scientific soil water salt regulations in the study an ecohydrological crop model waves the water vegetation energy and solute model was employed to examine the crop responses to soil water salt dynamics in a severely dry and saline region of southern xinjiang china observation data of film mulched cotton with the initial soil salinity of 7 19 9 80 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 56 2 12 ds m 1 were collected in 2009 and 2010 with five different irrigation water salinity treatments 0 11 05 g l 1 ec of 0 11 85 ds m 1 results showed that the relative absolute errors of simulated soil water and salt were less than 4 1 and 12 4 in 2010 calibration and 11 1 and 13 2 in 2009 validation the coefficient of determination of yield in calibration and validation was 0 93 and 0 74 respectively simulated dynamics indicated soil salt accumulation at a depth of 40 cm results of scenario analysis showed that crop water productivity was the highest when the total irrigation volume was 275 325 mm in all scenarios saline water with a certain degree of salinity can be used for irrigation without causing a severe yield reduction 20 reduction this study provided a scientific basis for water management in areas with severe drought and salinization keywords crop model salt stress cotton growth crop water productivity saline water irrigation 1 introduction the continuous growth of the world s population coupled with climate change puts forward new and higher requirements for the global food and fiber supply agricultural development still faces many challenges to keep up with the demand at present agricultural water use accounts for the largest proportion of total water use with the proportion even greater than 90 in some countries and the fresh water resources available for irrigation agriculture are increasingly scarce aquastat 2016 on the other hand inappropriate agricultural practices lead to land degradation with the enhancement of soil salinization soil degradation caused by salinization is deteriorating agricultural practices at an alarming rate 20 of the irrigated land were salt affected soils fao 2021 soil salinization has increasingly become a serious problem affecting global agricultural production and sustainability of land resources especially in arid and semi arid areas salinity along with drought makes agricultural development more difficult mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 management of water and salt is crucial to the sustainable agriculture in arid areas and crop model is an important tool for understanding the interactions between salt and water in order to develop sustainable water and salt management plans though current mainstream crop models have taken into account salt stress factors including swap ben asher et al 2006 jiang et al 2016 kumar et al 2015 hydrus phogat et al 2020 ramos et al 2011 unsatchem rasouli et al 2012 saltmed alkhasha and al omran 2019 chauhdary et al 2020 aquacrop kumar et al 2014 tan et al 2018 apsim radanielson et al 2018 zeng et al 2016 and waves zhang et al 1999a limited studies were conducted under severely saline condition there are no consistent criteria and authoritative standards for the classifications of salinization at present and different units were used to quantify the level of salinization generally soil is considered to be severely saline as soil salt content ssc g kg 1 is greater than 6 g kg 1 or electrical conductivity of soil water saturated paste ece ds m 1 is greater than 16 ds m 1 or electrical conductivity of soil water 1 5 extract paste ec1 5 ds m 1 is greater than 1 56 ds m 1 u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 gao et al 2011 zaman et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 taking the widely used model swap for example only 2 out of 29 researches about salinization were conducted under severely saline condition qureshi et al 2013 su et al 2005 the limited applications of crop models under severe salinization conditions may be related to the fact that those areas are not commonly used for farming because fewer crops are tolerant to high salinity levels allen et al 1998 salt tolerant crops such as cotton and barley are widely planted in moderate and severely saline area and great economic benefits are produced xinjiang is a typical severe salinization area in the arid northwest china and 32 of the arable land is affected by salinity yang et al 2019 up to 1 279 000 ha and 22 1 of the salinity affected area is severely saline cultivated land luo et al 2001 cotton production in xinjiang accounted for 87 3 of the total production of china in 2020 national bureau of statistics of the prc currently crop models considering crop response to water and salt stress are rarely studied in xinjiang tan et al 2018 simulated cotton growth and water salt dynamic using the aquacrop model in korla of southern xinjiang however the r2 the coefficient of determination of salinity was only 0 01 0 2 tan et al 2018 so crop modeling with appropriate parameters to conform with the local production practice is urgently needed for the water salt management in arid saline areas furthermore in the models mentioned above the crop responses to water salt coupling stress are mostly based on empirical relationships and are mainly in two different combinations of water stress and salt stress functions one assumes that the combined effect of water stress and salt stress are additive whereas the other assumes that they are multiplicative oster et al 2012 the combined matric and osmotic effects in waves model adopts an integrated rate methodology irm wu et al 1994 for multi factor growth rate modeling which is a semi empirical and semi mechanical methods irm is a procedure for constructing a single growth multiplier equation that integrates multiple environmental factors affecting plant growth into a number between zero and one the irm method is different from the empirical expressions above and is an effective attempt to relate crop growth rate to abiotic stress zhang et al 1999a used the waves model to simulate the growth of alfalfa and soil water salt dynamics under different scenarios of groundwater level 60 and 100 cm below the soil surface and groundwater salinity ec of 0 1 and 16 ds m 1 the results were in good agreement with the measurements however the salt module of the waves model still lacks validation and application in more areas e g areas with severe salinization and on more crops e g cotton taking all these factors together the objectives of this paper are to 1 evaluate the performance of waves model in the extremely dry and serious salinization region 2 simulate soil water and salt dynamics cotton growth and yield response under saline water irrigation conditions using the calibrated waves model and 3 optimize total irrigation volume and the threshold of irrigation water salinity under different scenarios the results are expected to provide a scientific basis for water and salt management of cotton farmland in arid and saline areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design the study was conducted from 2009 to 2010 at aksu national field research station of agro ecosystems 80 51 e longitude 40 37 n latitude altitude 1028 m xinjiang uygur autonomous region china the station is in the warm temperate zone with an arid climate the annual average temperature precipitation relative humidity sunshine hours pan evaporation and solar radiation are 11 3 45 7 mm 48 2948 h 2500 mm and 6000 mj m 2 respectively hu et al 2013 zhao et al 2010 low precipitation and strong evaporation make the area extremely arid the rainfall during the growth period was 62 3 and 67 3 mm in 2009 and 2010 the groundwater table at the station fluctuated within 0 54 3 04 m in 2009 2010 the predominant soil textures at this site are silty loam 25 4 sand 69 4 silt and 5 3 clay the average bulk density along the 1 m soil profile is 1 48 g cm 3 the saturated water content is 0 48 cm3 cm 3 the experiment was carried out in non weighing lysimeters with the sealed bottom 1 7 m height 2 m width and 2 5 m length the soil filled in the lysimeter was taken from the nearby saline land the salinity level of the soil before sowing was 7 19 9 80 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 56 2 12 ds m 1 which was classified as the severely saline soil gao et al 2011 the crop was cotton of the variety zhongmian 49 with drip irrigation under transparent film mulching the experimental site was surrounded by the cotton field freshwater surface water about 150 mm with a low salinity concentration of 0 46 g l 1 ec of 0 77 ds m 1 in 2009 and 0 35 g l 1 ec of 0 59 ds m 1 in 2010 was applied to provide necessary moisture before sowing no irrigation was applied at seedling stage to promote deeper root system and avoid spindling growth the first irrigation was applied in the budding period 21 6 2009 12 6 2010 with surface water to maintain plant vitality afterwards different irrigation treatments with saline water were applied and the detailed information was listed in table 1 saline water was a mix of saline drainage water and surface water and the ion composition of one sample was presented in table 2 the salt content per unit volume of water cw g l 1 was converted to electrical conductivity ec ds m 1 of water using the following equation 1 ec 18 45 e 0 09298 c w 18 45 r 2 0 99 52 samples the salinity level of the drainage water was 31 70 g l 1 ec of 17 48 ds m 1 in 2009 and 31 32 g l 1 ec of 17 45 ds m 1 in 2010 five treatments were arranged in a complete randomized design with three replications in a total of 15 lysimeters the irrigation schedule was shown in table 1 during the growing season 350 kg hm 2 of urea and 150 kg hm 2 of potassium dihydrogen phosphate were applied with water through drip irrigation other agronomic measures were carried out according to local experience the meteorological data including precipitation temperature sunshine hours and solar radiation were collected by an automatic weather station inside the experiment site soil samples were taken every 15 days during the growing season at depths of 5 15 25 35 50 and 70 cm for soil water electrical conductivity ec1 5 ds m 1 determination which was measured on 1 5 extracts for soil and water by weight the salt content in the soil solution c ss g l 1 was determined from ec1 5 following approach of xu et al 2013 first the soil salt content ssc g kg 1 was empirically related to ec1 5 as follows 2 ssc 4 6126ec1 5 r2 0 96 517 soil samples then the c ss was obtained on the basis of soil water content θ cm3 cm 3 ssc and bulk density γ g cm 3 using the equation 3 c ss ssc γ θ soil water content was measured once a week by the neutron probe at depths of 10 30 50 and 70 cm and the measurement of soil water content was also taken before and after the irrigation and rainfall events the neutron probe was calibrated by measured soil water content using the gravimetric method the leaf area index lai was measured only in 2010 with the assistance of a ci 110 plant canopy digital imager cotton yield lint for each plot was measured at harvest by hand harvesting with three replications the root samples were extracted by the root auger and root distribution was measured by hp 4850 scanner and delta t scan results showed that most of the root was distributed in the depth of 0 80 cm hu et al 2013 tan et al 2018 also fixed the soil depth at 80 cm within which all the water salt dynamics could be captured 2 2 model description the model used in this study is waves the water vegetation energy and solute model which was developed by csiro in 1993 dawes and short 1993 zhang and dawes 1998 zhang et al 1996 waves is a process based model at a daily time step and strikes a good balance between complexity usefulness and accuracy of prediction in energy water carbon and solute processes in a one dimensional soil canopy atmosphere system waves has been widely tested and applied in the field to simulate soil water budget and evapotranspiration et cheng et al 2014 gharun et al 2018 tian et al 2017 crop growth and yield kang et al 2003 wang et al 2001 groundwater recharge barron et al 2012 crosbie et al 2013 silberstein et al 2013 and water and carbon balance gharun et al 2018 silberstein et al 2013 in waves the infiltration of net rainfall and irrigation and soil water movement along the soil profile is simulated using a fully finite difference numerical solution of the richards equation as showed in eq 4 salt transport is obtained by solving convection dispersion equation as eq 5 assuming the solute is conservative

solute in the soil m2 s 1 waves considers osmotic potential to represent salt stress which can be obtained from the linear conversion of solute concentration as in eq 6 as for the coupling stress of water and salt it mainly reflects in two processes firstly waves simulates the impact of salt on carbon assimilation as in eqs 7 8 using an integrated rate method irm wu et al 1994 which is based on saturation rate kinetics the mathematical foundation of irm can be viewed as a generalization of michaelis menten kinetics to multiple substrates simply understood as an analogy with a parallel resistance network here a potential growth rate a max is determined which represents the maximum growth rate under the optimum condition a multiplier between 0 and 1 is applied based on the availability of environmental factors including water and salt this multiplier combines several biochemical and biophysical processes in an empirical relationship allowing for various processes and their interaction to be dealt with simultaneously besides it s easy to take into account other factors for example mccallum et al 2010 slightly modified waves model by considering the atmosphere of co2 availability of water varies with osmotic potential changes as in eq 8 salt stress has a negative effect on the availability of water and furthermore reduces carbon assimilation in other words as crop growth and carbon assimilation are closely related crop growth like lai and biomass formation above and below ground will slow down in the presence of salt and ultimately et and yield are

factor ψ wilt is the water potential at the wilting point m on the other hand salt stress affects the rate of root water absorption and its distribution in each layer as in eqs 9 13 in other words roots are able to adjust for water uptake accordingly the potential crop transpiration λ e c is calculated by a big leaf application of the penman monteith pm formula as in eq 9 one of its parameters crop resistance is linked to water availability as in eq 10 with considering the salt stress the amount of water absorbed by roots is distributed by the magnitude of water potential and root biomass in each layer of the root zone as showed in eqs 10 13 osmotic potential affects water potential and finally affects distribution of water extraction in each layer 9 λ e c r nc ρ c p vpd r ac γ 1 r wc

dynamically allocated from daily production as shown in eqs 14 16 waves model provides two methods to calculate final yield kang et al 2003 one is to multiply the accumulated above ground biomass by harvest index in the second method final yield is estimated by assuming a linear relationship between relative crop transpiration and production in this paper the latter method was adopted in yield

simulations the soil profile was divided into 40 layers and the surface layer was densified to capture the drastic water and salt changes the upper boundary condition was cauchy boundary condition determined by the irrigation and precipitation fluxes the evaporation e and transpiration t rates the bottom boundary condition was defined as a zero flux boundary condition because of the sealed bottom of the lysimeters the simulation period was from may 1 to october 13 day of year 121 286 in 2009 and may 11 to october 11 day of year 131 284 in 2010 covering the full growing season the parameters in the model consist of meteorological soil and crop parameters the meteorological parameters were obtained from the meteorological station at the site the soil parameters mainly the soil hydraulic properties were retrieved and adjusted manually to achieve good agreement between measured soil water content and water potential here we divided the soil into three layers and set the k c hydraulic conductivity at a very low value as 0 001 m day in the surface layer 0 0 002 m considering the mulching effect other soil parameters were shown in table 3 lines 26 30 there are various crop parameters in the waves model and a sensitivity analysis was carried out firstly to determine the most sensitive parameters in this study the sobol method sobol 2001 was used and the global sensitivity factor of 21 crop parameters were quantified fig 1 five model outputs including the e t et yield and biomass were analyzed according to the uncertain inputs overall there were 9 parameters that had a relatively large global sensitivity coefficient which indicated they had a greater impact on the outputs the 9 parameters were salt sensitivity factor maximum production rate accumulated temperature requirements optimum growth temperature semi optimum growth temperature above ground partitioning factor light extinction coefficient crop factor and soil albedo respectively among them salt sensitivity factor had the largest global sensitivity denoting that the model was sensitive to salt stress the soil albedo mainly affected e and the crop factor only affected the yield the remaining insensitive parameters were determined based on the measured or empirical values from literature there were more observations in 2010 so the data in 2010 were used for model calibration and the data in 2009 were used for verification the 9 sensitive parameters were calibrated against observed data in 2010 using the shuffled complex evolution sce ua duan et al 1994 which has been widely used for calibration of hydrological model parameters the objective functions in sce ua of soil moisture and soil salinity were optimized simultaneously with equal weights and crop parameters that affect yield were subsequently calibrated the crop parameters after calibration were shown in table 3 all the calibrated parameters were within their feasible ranges they were different from other c3 crop parameters recommended by zhang and dawes 1998 prior to this waves hasn t been used for simulating the growth of cotton in this study the parameters of waves were determined on the specific crop of cotton in the extremely dry and serious salinization area which would provide a reference for the future work 2 4 performance evaluation statistical indices including the coefficient of

achieves 2 5 scenario simulations and analyses optimized farmland management requires knowledge of the yield response water consumption and water productivity in different scenarios considering the heterogeneity of soil moisture and salinity and the management practice different scenarios in this study included different initial soil water contents of 0 25 0 30 0 35 and 0 40 cm3 cm 3 initial soil salt contents of 7 0 7 5 8 0 8 5 9 0 9 5 and 10 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 52 1 63 1 73 1 84 1 95 2 06 and 2 17 ds m 1 irrigation water salinity of 0 5 10 15 and 20 g l 1 ec of 0 6 86 11 17 13 88 and 15 58 ds m 1 and total irrigation volumes of 200 500 mm gradient 25 mm the scenario simulations assumed that the initial soil water and salt content were evenly distributed along the profile the rainfall during the growth period in 2010 was 67 3 mm which was slightly higher than the multi year average of 62 2 mm since 2010 http data cma cn the interannual variability of other meteorological factors

season 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance 3 1 1 soil water content goodness of fit test indices of soil water content in 2010 calibration and 2009 validation were shown in table 4 r2 of all the treatments was greater than 0 75 the values of nse were all greater than 0 5 in the calibration the range of mae was 0 009 0 011 cm3 cm 3 the range of rmse was 0 011 0 013 cm3 cm 3 and the mre was less than 4 1 in the validation the range of mae was 0 013 0 028 cm3 cm 3 and the range of rmse was 0 016 0 031 cm3 cm 3 except for the treatment 1 t1 the mre was less than 7 9 although the error was enlarged during validation it was within the acceptable range han et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 these results were comparable with the results of the published studies about the waves model cheng et al 2014 tian et al 2017 zhang et al 1999a overall the simulated soil water content and the measured data is comparable which showed that waves is capable of modeling soil water content in the cotton field fig 2 showed the temporal variation of the simulated average soil water content the trend of the simulated moisture was consistent with the measurement both in calibration 2010 and validation 2009 especially good matching was observed in calibration as expected from table 4 deviations still existed a closer look of the results indicated that the model underestimated the high soil water content in the initial period day of year 120 170 for both years especially in 2009 this may be attributed to waves s inability to take the film effect into account physically and thus it caused an overestimation of the et and mainly the e minimizing the hydraulic conductivity in the soil surface layer is not enough to fully reflect the mulching effect in the early period i e seeding stage the cotton canopy was very small and the evaporation was dominant when the film effect was neglected the large bare soil was open to the atmosphere with extremely strong evaporation and e was great and overestimated considerably li et al 2013 this resulted an obvious simulated deviation in the early stage and smaller simulated values of soil water content than the measurement as the canopy developed simulation errors decreased in addition the pm formula was generally considered to be suitable for evapotranspiration calculation of the dense canopies lai 2 and the calculation error was larger when the canopy was sparse at the seedling stage lagos et al 2011 tian et al 2017 found that there was also an underestimation of soil water content in the early stage using waves relatively lager deviations were also found between the simulated and measured values at the later stages of t1 and t2 in 2009 which may be caused by the errors in the initial water storage considering sufficient irrigation was applied before sowing the initial soil moisture content below 1 3 m was set to be near saturation based on experience however in t1 and t2 in 2009 the water content in the deep layer may not reach saturation the inconsistency leads to an overestimation of the upward water supply in the later stage and thus the simulated moisture was greater than the observation 3 1 2 soil water salinity table 5 shows the statistical indexes between the simulated and measured salt concentration r2 of all the treatments was all greater than 0 5 except for t5 in 2010 with the value of 0 49 in calibration 2010 mae and mre were 6 40 7 30 g l 1 and 11 0 12 4 respectively in validation 2009 mae and mre were 3 34 8 07 g l 1 and 5 9 13 2 the simulated error was on the lower side of the range reported by tan et al 2018 hassanli et al 2016 and jiang et al 2011 however compared with mre of the soil water content the results for salinity were larger the explanation was that waves model establishes the convection dispersion equation based on the solution of the richards equation as most models do and thus the simulated moisture error will be added to the salt modeling hao et al 2015 in addition this may be attributed to the fact that there were limited measured points and the soil sampling sites were different at each time meanwhile the soil salt content itself had a great spatial variability soil water and salt transport parameters had large spatial variability verma et al 2012 but waves used a set of unified parameters to simplify the complex systems as most models do moreover the model didn t consider the effects of crop absorption of ion these may all contributed to the simulated error fig 3 described the temporal variation of soil water salinity the simulated soil salinity profiles were broadly consistent with measured soil salinity profiles though there was bias as illustrated in fig 3 the salt concentration was slightly underestimated in validation 2009 and in the early stage of calibration 2010 but it was overestimated in the later stage of 2010 in order to check the source of the error in the salt concentration simulation the temporal variation of treatments t1 and t5 in 2009 was plotted in fig 4 it can be seen that simulated result of the surface layer 5 cm depth had the largest error followed by the layer of 15 cm depth while the simulated values in deeper layers matched well with the measured data after irrigation the simulated salinity in the surface layer at a depth of 5 cm decreased rapidly and was lower than the measurements in the middle growth stages mainly in the flowering and boll stage the increasing trend of the simulated surface salt concentration was not obvious and much smaller than the measured data after each irrigation event the high complexity of the upper boundary conditions may be the cause of reduced accuracy in the surface salt simulation jiang et al 2016 the film effect in the surface evaporation and water movement may also influence the simulation accuracy of the surface salt which needs a further study zheng et al 2009 in summary the underestimation of salinity in the surface layer for most treatments may explain the slightly underestimated salinity in fig 3 in the later growth period of 2010 day of year 230 280 the salinity was overestimated but the simulation matched well with the last measurement october 29 which indicated that a consistent change trend of the model simulation the deviation may be caused by systematic errors in salinity measurement 3 1 3 crop growth and yield the measurements and simulations of lai in 2010 were shown in fig 5 the mae was 0 19 cm2 cm 2 the model can grasp the basic characteristics of the development of the lai the simulated maximum value was between 1 65 and 2 5 cm2 cm 2 which is lower than some published data of cotton lai up to 5 cm2 cm 2 gao et al 2019 soil salt content may greatly affect canopy growth and similar lai result was found in xinjiang with an average soil salinity of 6 07 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 32 ds m 1 within 1 0 m root depth ning et al 2013 moreover the differences may be related to cotton variety geographical location irrigation amount and so on the simulated lai curve was a unimodal curve as the same shape of simulated lai zhang et al 1999b produced when the lai developed to the maximum the canopy began to decline at a large rate immediately instead of maintaining at a relatively high lai level and falling down slowly in waves the respiration load was multiplied by 20 to cause the carbon pools to senesce to avoid introducing extra parameters and better describe the life cycle the number of measurements is also supposed to increase for further verifying and modifying the lai simulation in waves model lint yield was presented in fig 6 the simulated and measured data displayed a linear relationship with r2 of 0 93 in calibration 2010 and 0 74 in validation 2009 the mre in calibration and validation was 9 2 and 5 9 respectively the simulation accuracy was similar to previous studies jiang et al 2016 verma et al 2012 the points in fig 6 were a little bit discrete which may be due to the simulation error of the soil moisture content and soil salt content previously mentioned in general the accuracy of yield simulation was acceptable and the waves model can reflect the yield differences between different treatments with saline water irrigation and initial severely saline soil cotton was classified as a salt tolerant plant allen et al 1998 considerable yield was still obtained with the high salinity soil which implied that cotton has a great planting potential how to maximize the growth potential of cotton in the severe salinization soil needs a further study 3 2 simulated dynamics of soil water and salinity 3 2 1 soil water content and et table 6 showed average normalized water availability χ w calculated by eq 8 and also the simulated et and e during the growing period the water availability indicated the intensity of water salt stress total irrigation volume was the same among different treatments thus χ w mainly reflected salt stress the smaller χ w was the stronger stress the crop suffered in general as the salinity of irrigation water increased t1 to t5 which brought more salt into the soil the salt stress was intensified but χ w didn t simply decrease from t1 to t5 with some subtle differences the larger initial soil salinity value of t3 9 8 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 2 12 ds m 1 table 1 leads to a smaller χ w than t4 and t5 in calibration 2010 the same pattern was found during the validation 2009 salt stress was caused by the combined effect of the irrigated saline water and the initial soil salt content waves integrated these two sources of salt stress into a single variable and it was easier for comparison from table 6 when the χ w was smaller and the salt stress intensified crop transpiration reduced as many studies reported ben asher et al 2006 jiang et al 2016 minhas et al 2020 the average values of soil water content in fig 2 showed that the soil moisture gradually decreased at the seedling stage without irrigation and after the regular irrigation started at the budding stage the soil moisture began to fluctuate showing an overall downward trend fig 7 showed the simulated et and e during the growth period it can be seen that et got smaller with smaller χ w for example χ w in t1 of 2010 was the largest and et was the highest accordingly consistent with fig 7 t1 in 2010 had the lowest average soil water content as depicted in fig 2 because more water lost through evapotranspiration from table 6 we can also see that the smaller χ w was the greater the proportion of e to et was it was because when salt stress was strong generally the canopy development was poor with a reduced t and the canopy coverage was at a low level this means that the exposed area increased and e increased minhas et al 2020 with the reduced t and increased e the percentage of e increased the average rate of e et was at a relatively high level of 26 9 which was closer to the result without mulching tian et al 2016 this was mainly due to the fact that the surface resistance was greatly underestimated without considering the mulching effect which led to an overestimation of e the deviation was obvious especially in the early stage of sparse canopy and after irrigation in the early stage more available energy would reach the soil surface and after irrigation a larger amount of water was available for evaporation which resulted in larger errors in both cases the e ratio under film should be less than 20 rosa et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 and this should be modified in the waves model 3 2 2 soil salt content fig 8 showed the spatial and temporal changes of the total soil salt content g kg 1 along different depths during the growth period under saline water irrigation in 2010 similar trend was found in 2009 as shown in fig 8 the soil salt content in the surface layer changed relatively dramatically influenced by irrigation the salt content was the highest at a depth of 40 cm with a tendency of salt accumulation this may be due to the fact that irrigation washed the surface salt down and that salt in the deep layers was transported upwards through evaporation eventually the salt concentrated at the depth around 40 cm the soil salt content was relatively stable at 60 80 cm and the salt content tended to decrease below the soil layer of 80 cm salt in the deep layers during the growing period was continuously transported to the upper layers at the beginning of the growing period the soil salt content was distributed evenly in the soil profile with the highest soil salt content below the depth of 40 cm however by the end of the growing period the soil salt content differed greatly in the soil profile the high salt content layer shifted to shallow layers and the soil salt content reached a fairly high level average 12 34 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 2 68 ds m 1 at 80 cm profile and was 136 157 of the original salt content of the soil profile chen et al 2010 also reported salt accumulation in xinjiang that the average salinity in the 1 0 m soil profile at the end of growing season was 336 and 547 of the original soil profile respectively for electrical conductivity of irrigation water of 3 6 ds m 1 and 6 7 ds m 1 the experiment was conducted in the soil with the ece of 1 15 1 90 ds m 1 not severely saline so there may be differences in soil salt accumulation rate unlike the study of verma et al 2014 which located in the monsoon climate zone it doesn t have abundant rainfall in xinjiang for salt leaching therefore it needs to take the initiative to leach the salt to deep layers before sowing in xinjiang chen et al 2010 suggested that a flood irrigation in the fallow period was much more efficient than applying the same extra amount of water during the growing season 3 3 scenario analysis figs 9 and 10 showed the simulation results with the initial soil water content of 0 35 cm3 cm 3 which indicated an irrigation before sowing was applied and the soil profile water content was close to field capacity scenario simulations were conducted and plots of yield versus irrigation water amount were shown in fig 9 with a given initial soil water content the yield gradually decreased when the irrigation salinity increased when the initial soil salt content increased and other conditions remain the same the yield showed a downward trend as well the results were expected because higher irrigation salinity and initial soil salt content impose a greater osmotic stress on the crop oster et al 2012 shani et al 2005 the yield output showed an increasing trend with the increase of the total irrigation volume enhanced irrigation volume will increase soil water storage that alleviate the salt stress and increase the possibility for leaching salt into deeper layer with further increase of the irrigation amount production growth was slow qureshi et al 2013 reported similar phenomenon in the cotton field for the scenarios with high irrigation amount the yield differences between different irrigation salinity were small it suggested that a feasible measure for making use of the high salinity water was to increase the irrigation volume but at the same time it was necessary to pay attention to the drainage regulation fig 10 showed the changes of wp c which differed with different initial soil salt contents and total irrigation volume when soil salt content was less than or equal to 8 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 73 ds m 1 and the total irrigation volume was less than or equal to 275 mm wp c appeared stable as the total irrigation volume increased wp c started to decline and then gradually stabilized when the soil salt content was higher than 8 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 73 ds m 1 wp c gradually increased as the total irrigation volume increased when the total irrigation volume exceeded 275 mm wp c also showed a downward trend it can be concluded that with the increase of total irrigation volume the increase rates of yield and et were not consistent when there was relatively limited irrigation yield grew faster than et and wp c tended to increase because when the soil salt content was high increased irrigation water can remove the salt in the root zone of cotton and alleviated the water and salt stress to some extent this effect was limited when the total irrigation volume was larger than 275 mm and the increase rate of et exceeded the increase rate of yield production since climate in xinjiang was very dry and the atmospheric evaporation capacity was strong with further increase of total irrigation volume the yield was limited by soil salinity and cotton variety and the potential for yield increasing was small meanwhile the ineffective transpiration increased largely which caused a decrease of wp c in general with the increase of initial soil salt content wp c also gradually decreased the total irrigation volume with wp c reaching its maximum was about 275 300 mm when the objective was to seek a balance between water use and production it was recommended that the irrigation amount in the growing period be controlled around 300 mm if the aim was set to increase yield the irrigation amount could be further increased it s worth mentioning that wp c alone was not enough to identify the best option for irrigation in the field management because the profit function of the production has not been considered in this study fernández et al 2020 it was generally acknowledged that a severe yield reduction occurred when the reduction was greater than 20 the maximum yield was regarded as the optimal yield in this study and the critical value for severe reduction was 2374 kg ha 1 when the initial water content of the soil was 0 35 cm3 cm 3 it can be seen from fig 9 that the management plans for achieving the yield above the horizontal dotted line was applicable to avoid severe yield reduction it could be a reference for the local irrigation practice when the irrigation amount was greater than 475 mm there will be no severe reduction in yield for all scenarios for the initial salt content of the soil of 7 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 52 ds m 1 to avoid severe yield reduction the irrigation amount should be greater than 225 mm in order to get a higher yield it was necessary to irrigate more water or reduce the initial salt content of soil as much as possible it can be estimated that irrigation water with the amount of 275 mm and a salinity less than 2 g l 1 ec of 3 13 ds m 1 fig 9e would help to achieve a balance between saving water and ensuring yield except for the scenarios with soil salt content at 9 5 and 10 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 2 06 and 2 17 ds m 1 from fig 9 and fig 10 it means that wp c reached a fairly large value and no severe reduction occurred in addition as shown in the figure if the amount of irrigation was appropriate saline water with a certain degree of mineralization can be used for irrigation regardless of the initial salt content when the initial soil salt contents are 8 8 5 9 9 5 and 10 kg 1 the amount of irrigation water with a salinity of 5 g l 1 ec of 6 86 ds m 1 greater than 225 275 300 350 and 400 mm respectively can be applied to avoid severe yield reduction increasingly scarce fresh water resources are forcing people to use low quality water for irrigation including the use of saline water for irrigation all over the world huang et al 2012 qadir et al 2007 wang et al 2007 in the plain area of xinjiang saline groundwater with a salinity of 3 5 g l 1 ec of 4 49 6 86 ds m 1 is 44 265 km2 hu et al 2013 in the southern xinjiang the actual development of groundwater resources was only 18 9 li et al 2014 this study indicated that an appropriate amount of saline groundwater could be used in irrigation to alleviate the shortage of freshwater the initial soil water content of 0 25 cm3 cm 3 and the initial salt content of the soil exceeded 8 5 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 84 ds m 1 would directly lead to a severe reduction in production not shown in the figure when the initial salinity of the soil was 8 5 8 0 7 5 and 7 0 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 1 84 1 73 1 63 and 1 52 ds m 1 the irrigation amount should be equal to or larger than 500 450 375 300 mm respectively to avoid severe yield reduction when the initial soil water content was 0 4 cm3 cm 3 the requirement for irrigation amount and water salinity during the growing period can be correspondingly reduced it can be seen that to ensure a certain initial soil water content was important for the growth of cotton in seedlings and this value should be greater than 0 25 cm3 cm 3 for wp c not shown when the initial water content of the soil was 0 25 0 30 and 0 40 cm3 cm 3 the corresponding irrigation amount for reaching the highest wp c was 325 300 and 275 mm respectively many studies have suggested that the climate in northwest china has gradually become wetter since the 1960 s under the warming background wang et al 2020 thus with the increase of precipitation the irrigation water demand may be correspondingly reduced or yield may increase however the coupling effect of increased temperature and rainfall on cotton growth remains to be further studied to analyze and predict the threshold of sustainability under climate change by considering different future climatic scenarios will be more comprehensive for evaluating the model performance and agricultural development and management for xinjiang and similar areas 4 conclusions the ecohydrological crop model waves was used to simulate the water and salt dynamics cotton growth and yield irrigated with saline water in a typical irrigation district in southern xinjiang with severely dry and serious salinization the main conclusions were as follows 1 the model obtained the dynamic changes of soil water and salt with high accuracy the relative absolute error of soil water content soil salt content and cotton yield were within 11 1 13 2 and 6 0 in validation thus the available crop parameters of waves were generated with acceptable accuracy but the simulation result of soil water content was relatively unsatisfactory in the early growth stage and the simulated salt content in the surface layer also had a discrepancy the poor performance was due to the fact that the effect of film mulching was not able to consider in waves 2 the simulated e et was greater than the theoretical value for neglecting the effects of mulching during the growth period salt accumulated to the shallow layer along with evaporation and the salt accumulation was obvious at the depth of 40 cm 3 scenarios with different initial soil water contents initial salt contents irrigation water salinities and total irrigation volumes were analyzed the results showed that the crop water productivity was the highest when the total amount of irrigation water was 275 325 mm saline water with a certain salinity can be used for irrigation without causing a severe reduction in yield 20 reduction irrigation water with the amount of 275 mm and a salinity less than 2 g l 1 ec of 3 13 ds m 1 would help to achieve a balance between saving water and ensuring yield when soil salt content was less than 9 5 g kg 1 ec1 5 of 2 06 ds m 1 waves model is a process based model that achieves a balance between accuracy and complexity in xinjiang under the severely dry climate and soil salinization further work should be done to consider the mulching effect and climate change scenarios for an improvement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9936,agricultural food production systems are facing the challenging task to provide food and socio economic welfare while preserving natural resources in the long term in morocco the green moroccan plan steered the promotion of groundwater based drip irrigation over the last decade the plan encouraged producers to shift to cash crop production this is how tomato became a main agri food export commodity mostly produced in greenhouses in the souss massa region and produced intensively in open fields for local demand in the northern part of the country however water resources are expected to become particularly scarce over the next decades increasing the vulnerabilities of tomato farmers in face of unforeseen changes and shocks the main purpose of this study is to show a how global and local tomato value chains respond to irrigation schemes and b what the environmental consequences are by means of a system dynamics model and a survey conducted among a sample of 244 producers we describe and outline the major interactions between agricultural ecological and socio economic dimensions of the tomato production systems the results of the model simulations highlight how overexploitation of groundwater tables negatively affects crop production and farmers welfare the model shows that in the near future water scarcity will have long lasting consequences on the producers such as reduced productivity and losses in cash flow our model results highlight that measures need to be taken in the coming years in order to prevent the predicted irremediable water shortage in 2030 we conclude that the current groundwater management will in the long term lead to irreversible groundwater depletion which will enhance already existing inequalities between the two types of producers urgent actions have to be taken in order to sustainably manage water while supporting farmers in the long term keywords agricultural food system system dynamics simulation groundwater management 1 introduction designing policies that ensure food security support social and economic welfare and at the same time preserve natural resources in the long term is challenging historically the prospect of economic growth coupled with agricultural intensification has led to the unsustainable use of resources and environmental degradation in several countries alauddin and quiggin 2008 gohari et al 2013 xu 2001 today long term effects of some policies such as deepening socio economic inequalities and degradation of natural resources can be observed manero 2017 these effects are further exacerbated by climate change and market instabilities among others ouraich et al 2019 rochdane et al 2014 those incremental stresses can lead the system to a regime shift that may evoke large unexpected changes in ecosystem services and human livelihoods scheffer and carpenter 2003 to avoid unanticipated consequences of agricultural policies in the future such as the dependency of some food systems on subsidy programs gerber 2016 it is crucial to investigate the dynamics arising from the complex interrelationships in food and farming systems in countries facing increasing water scarcity suitable water management and more particularly water savings in agriculture becomes a necessity over the last decades governmental water agencies in these countries have encouraged farmers to shift to localized irrigation methods such as drip irrigation to save water groundwater based drip irrigation appeared to be the most secure and reliable solution to provide access to water especially in semi arid and arid areas postel et al 2001 the combination of drip irrigation and trade policies has fostered the intensification of existing farming systems and subsequently high value crops ameur et al 2017 kang et al 2009 such as fresh fruits and vegetables this contributed to the rapid expansion of agri food export production and global food value chains akesbi 2014 paradoxically the conversion to drip irrigation and the shift in cropping patterns has increased the water consumption in morocco molle and tanouti 2017a the extensive groundwater exploitation along with the recent droughts have led to over exploitation of water resources alcalá et al 2015 bekkar et al 2009 thus the design of water resource management policies requires an integrated perspective that considers biophysical and socio economic aspects as well as potential feedbacks associated with the introduction of such policies batchelor et al 2014 berbel and mateos 2014 in the agricultural food production systems operationalizing the interactions between disparate measures of productivity and sustainability necessarily requires an adequate understanding of the complex interactions between environmental social and economic drivers socio ecological systems ses contain a multitude of diverse components interacting non linearly and dynamically in both space and time walters et al 2016 more specifically for water resources management systems it has been argued that the inability to develop sustainable solutions is grounded in the lack of understanding about the interconnections and dynamics of different sub systems davies and simonovic 2011 kotir et al 2016 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 system feedbacks are key mechanisms that influence the sustainability of social ecological systems the system dynamics modelling sdm approach offers a way to gain understanding of an interconnected and complex systems behavior over time and its non linear feedback mechanism kopainsky et al 2017 turner et al 2016 this modeling approach is also a tool to support the design of policies or strategies for improving system performance over time kopainsky et al 2012 kopainsky and luna reyes 2008 sterman 2001 several recent studies have used the sdm approach to develop system dynamic and simulation models in various agricultural systems such as understanding the role of fertilizer subsidy program in zambia to increase maize availability or analyzing food security resilience to climate change in guatemala alifujiang et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 gerber 2016 herrera 2017 xu 2001 the diversity of sdm applications contributed to an improved understanding of the current and future dynamics of water resources management systems for several contexts such as exploring policy scenarios for sustainable water resource management and agricultural development in the volta region in ghana or develop smart groundwater governance in iran barati et al 2019 kotir et al 2016 the tomato production in morocco allows us to explore the complex interplay between agricultural production farmers economic welfare and ecological preservation it becomes relevant to further investigate what are the synergies and trade offs between those three aspects of agroecosystems hence with this study we aim to understand the consequences and the cascading impacts on the socio ecological systems of the irrigation schemes for both global and local tomato producers by using sdm to evaluate the cascading impacts of irrigation on the sustainability of these agricultural systems more concretely we seek to answer to the question what are the different socio ecological implications of the green moroccan plan of both natural resources and humans using sdm enables to highlight the interconnections within this socio ecological system drawing those linkages become then crucial to investigate the disparities between several groups of producers the first section of the paper provides an in depth description of the case study and its specificities based on a literature review and interviews with experts then we present a social ecological system ses model and describe the main modules composing the model using this model we analyze the long term effects of the system with a status quo scenario finally we analyze the outcome of the model and identify the implications of the agricultural irrigation and production strategies with a special focus on the outcomes for agricultural production producer s economic welfare and water resources we chose sdm as a coherent and relevant approach for analyzing complex ses behavior balali et al 2015 stave and kopainsky 2015 2 water governance and a dual agricultural system 2 1 agricultural strategy and water governance in 2008 the moroccan government launched an agricultural strategy the green moroccan plan gmp to rehabilitate agriculture and turn it into the main engine of economic growth and a tool against poverty in morocco this strategy was based on two pillars and was expected to reach both large and small actors along the agricultural value chains the first pillar of the strategy aimed to promote modern agriculture with high added value crops adapted to export markets the second pillar aimed to develop an approach to fight against poverty by significantly increasing agricultural income for the most vulnerable farmers particularly in disadvantaged or peripheral areas plan maroc vert 2008 akesbi 2012 moroccan agriculture has essentially been shaped and divided by these two pillars the differences between these two systems became particularly visible in the fruit and vegetable sector with 517 thousand tons of fresh tomato exported making the crop one of the flagship products for export faostat for 2017 among other targets this latter strategy aims at converting 50 of the moroccan irrigated agricultural land area by 2020 to drip irrigation through a national subsidy program alonso et al 2019 however over the past decade the expected results of this strategy officially ending in 2020 have been widely disputed akesbi 2014 faysse 2015 ouraich and tyner 2018 sippel 2016 previous studies argue on the one hand too much focus on agricultural intensive practices and productivist models to the expense of natural resources preservation on the other hand the subsidies conversion to drip irrigation and the expansion of intensive farming had severe impacts on water contrary to what was announced the latter underlines the need to integrate major challenges related to water management or global competitiveness boudhar et al 2017 schyns and hoekstra 2014 2 2 a dual production system the diversity of horticultural production systems for tomato especially ranges from open field grown systems to greenhouse production systems soil or soil less culture georgios k and maximilin 2017 in morocco exported tomatoes are produced in greenhouses that are extensively mechanized and generates a yield from 120 to 250 t ha 1 wet weight this system benefits from better connection to processing industry and cooperatives that ensure conditioning of the crop and access to export markets around 85 of total tomatoes destined for export are produced in the souss massa region omrvasm 2015 considered as one of the most important agricultural poles 55 of the exported fruits and vegetables are produced in this region in order to meet the european off season demand from september to may this semi arid region is characterized by a low average rainfall of 200 mm year 1 and average temperature of 24 ºc ait brahim et al 2017 malki et al 2017 the high water demand for the crops has led to the over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation purposes the chtouka aquifer located in the region has recorded an annual deficit of 58 60 million m3 per year over the last two decades hirich 2016 malki et al 2017 agricultural productivity has subsequently increased groundwater resources depletion and degradation rates over the last decades payen et al 2014 due to its strategic economic and political importance the region has been extensively studied over the last decades and quantitative information on the water and agricultural situation is available in the scientific and grey literature several studies ait brahim et al 2017 malki et al 2017 showed the groundwater depletion patterns as well as its impacts on the quality of the water in contrast to large export producers smaller producers are growing tomatoes in irrigated open fields from april to october along with other vegetables throughout the year generating lower yields from 40 to 80 t ha 1 see fig 1 for clarity reasons open field smaller producers will be referred to as farmers in the following sections according to the data provided by the ministry of agriculture the rabat sale kénitra rsk region has produced most of the irrigated and open field tomatoes in recent years 73 thousand tons in 2017 dss 2017 rsk is considered as one of the most important areas for fresh fruit and vegetable production such production using drip irrigation has fostered extensive groundwater exploitation for the rsk region we found no studies reporting quantitatively on the depletion of the resources however several studies on morocco and regions close by reported on the groundwater over exploitation and the subsequent issues regarding water quality and availability hirich 2016 malki et al 2017 najib et al 2016 3 material and methods 3 1 simulation approach to investigate the dynamic interactions within the chosen agricultural system we developed a system dynamics model sdm representing the moroccan tomato ses according to repenning 2002 there are two corresponding benefits for the approach to mathematically represent an ses as an sdm first a model allows to implement the internal consistency of the theory and ensures that the behavior it purports to explain can in fact be generated by its underlying assumptions second a model can serve as a sort of a laboratory to test different scenarios into the future thus we developed a sdm model to understand the dynamic interactions between tomato production farmers welfare and groundwater depletion the dynamic behavior arises through a non linear interaction of feedback loops connecting the three following components ecological agricultural and socio economic see fig 2 3 2 data collection the following four step procedure allowed us to capture the specificity of this ses to observe the cause and effect relationships as well as the feedback loops within the system and to gather information for a quantitative representation first an in depth literature review was conducted to develop a modeling framework the framework allows illustrating the system s structure and feedback mechanisms sterman 2001 furthermore the literature review allowed identifying how systems components influence each other i e the polarity of the causality which is essential in understanding system s behavior also we identified drivers that leads to perturbations of a loop that may then amplify the original effect a reinforcing loop r or into an equilibrating response a balancing loop b this first step led to the description of the model through a causal loop diagram second we conducted a series of expert interviews and several field visits which allowed more empirical observations for the interviews we used a semi structured approach which allowed us to validate and quantify the causalities established through the literature review in the first step and also to identify the specificities of the tomato production system the interviews were conducted with agricultural consultants delegates of the ministry of agriculture fisheries rural development water and forests academics farmers and farmers cooperatives see table 2 the first two steps allowed us to establish a modeling framework that is a qualitative statement about a system s structure consequently in a third step this framework was further used as a base for developing and calibrating the quantitative simulation model to get quantitative data to adjust the model a survey among 244 producers was conducted in spring 2018 see table 1 the fourth step of the data collection was based on the formal mathematical simulations run on the modelling framework technically the model consisted of a set of coupled non linear first order integral equations once the model was calibrated and validated see appendix it was used to test the sensitivity of some key indicators and served as a virtual playground in which to test different experiments and scenarios from agricultural management practices to policy implementations the full model was designed using vensim software ventana 2015 3 3 survey outcome the survey informed us on the specificities of the 2 typologies of tomato producers and provided basic information such as average yield in recent seasons farm size area allocated for tomato production irrigation infrastructures links to markets participation in cooperatives and access to other social support moreover the results of the survey provided support for the model analysis and interpretation complementary the survey conducted in 2018 shows the main characteristics and differences between the two types of producers firstly drip irrigation system is used by all producers surveyed water is entirely supplied from wells in the rsk region and in sm region 31 of the producers also use well however the majority of producers extract water from boreholes highlighting there need to pump at deeper level to have access to water then results from the survey indicate that for open field farmers water management practices such as water harvesting techniques are not applied see table 2 only 9 9 are mulching there fields while it has been shown in other mediterranean context that mulching reduces the water footprint of crops more than drip irrigation and when those two practices are combined the effects on water conservations are higher nouri et al 2019 water harvesting techniques are also a key farm management practice to integrate in order to minimize water intake from the groundwater table some farmers surveyed have reported the use of semi circular bunds as a way to collect water run offs an increase soil moisture in the same perspective of increasing the water retention capacities of the soil some farmers have reported the use of compost that is furthermore used as a source of organic fertilizer increasing soil moisture could thus influence positively the recharge of the aquifer however farmer s lack of accountability in water management on the field have been reported in other studies bekkar et al 2009 the slow dynamics arising from groundwater exploitation can compromise farmers acknowledgement of the scope and urgency of the threat in the long run secondly the survey results indicate that tomato production is one of the main sources of income for both type of producers with 96 4 of the producers considering tomato as their main income source in sm region and 58 6 in the rsk region thus 100 of the open field farmers grow other fruits and vegetables showing a certain diversity within their farm only 33 of the greenhouse producers are growing other crops which shows on the other hand the high reliance for tomato as a high value crop however the producers surveyed present also major differences in terms of accessibility to markets while the open field producers in rsk region only have access to local and regional markets the greenhouse producers in sm region have both access to export market and local and regional markets 3 4 modeling framework for explanatory purposes the model is split into modules that explores the socio ecological dynamics in the system versus the natural resources supporting it we present here the main modules in order to explain the underlying links in each of the model outcomes that were chosen as sustainable indicators for this study 3 4 1 socio economic modules the following two sub modules aim to represent the dual agricultural production system for tomato production in the country a typology of two different modes of production and producers have been established in order to describe the situation in the two different regions of the country 3 4 1 1 open field farmers dynamics the farm management sub module is a central part of the model establishing the link between the social ecological structures namely the crop production and the income generation this sub module describes an open field farm producing mostly vegetables as a main source of income incl net revenue from tomato production and other revenues results from the survey indicates that open field farmers are producing other crops the seasonality of tomato production would enable themthe characteristics of the farm management have been designed according to the field observations and the average data from the survey see table 2 it is assumed here that those tomato producers are family farmers and have alternative sources of income different crop production and or off farm activities open field farmers in this specific context only have access to the local and regional markets the main stock represents the farmers cash flow it depends on the net income from tomato production and sales other crop production and other activities see r1 in fig 3 as the cash flow increase farmers can increase their expenditures on machineries or irrigation systems like digging their wells deeper regularly which has a balancing effect of increasing the expenses and decreasing the potential cash flow see b4 in fig 3 3 4 1 2 greenhouse producers dynamics greenhouse production for export requires knowledge in terms of technical expertise but also a different set of infrastructure and thus production costs aloui and kenny 2005 sippel 2016 with an initial capital to start the producing activities exporters can invest in quality inputs labor and mechanized tools to produce a higher yield than open field producers here again three stocks characterize the economic dimension within the farm the farm infrastructure is considered as a stock and is the one enabling producers to invest in the first place on mechanized tools good quality inputs and land to extend their production area exporters tomatoes have to meet certain standards of quality to be able to be exported to european and international markets that explains the high costs of production see fig 4 3 4 2 agricultural and ecological resource modules 3 4 2 1 water and groundwater dynamics this sub module focuses on water management and groundwater use the aquifers of the studied region are represented as stocks inflows to the stock come from upward drainage from deep aquifer river and flood water infiltration percolated water from irrigation and recharge from rainfall abhbc 2012 malki et al 2017 the outflows are water discharges mainly driven by agricultural water consumption indeed in both of the studied region the use of the aquifers is mostly dedicated to irrigation and agricultural production the more water is available in the natural reservoirs the more water is accessible for agriculture and the easier it is to access it but the more water is used for agriculture the less water is left in the natural reservoirs see loop b9 in fig 5 similarly this reinforcing feedback loop occurs for the open field farming region the more water is available and use the higher is the intake for the crop see r5 in fig 5 higher water uptake leads to higher yields than otherwise which eventually contribute to an increase in the household s revenue cash availability can result in irrigation infrastructure expenditure as shown in fig 4 loop b5 the water consumed by the agricultural sector is a minimum function of the maximum water extracted for agricultural purposes and groundwater used for irrigation 3 4 2 2 yield finally another core part of the model represents the interactions between input use and yields the yields for both greenhouse and open field production are dependent on the effect of both water and fertilizer use this agricultural sub module has been elaborated to capture the influence of nutrient and water dynamics on yields gerber 2016 the main reinforcing feedback loop r7 see fig 6 describe the links between agricultural productivity revenues generated by the production and expenses and use of fertilizers and water to increase the production the nutrient uptake is influenced by the fertilization application and soil organic nutrient dynamics the soil sub module captures the main dynamics of the soil organic nitrogen and carbon in the soil soil organic carbon and nitrogen are two stocks linking fertilizers use and the soil dynamics nitrogen plant uptake affects directly the yields and constitutes a natural constraint of how much can be produced r9 for further information see the appendix 3 4 3 modeling timeframe and simulations to simulate the effects we ran the model within a timeframe 2008 2050 on the one hand the model covers the historical behavior of the last decade since the implementation of the gmp in 2008 on the other hand the model is used to simulate the behavior until the year of 2050 the selected timeframe allowed 1 to validate the model by comparing its results to the actual data see methodx and 2 to observe and understand the long term environmental and socio economic processes in this dual tomato production system the first objective of the simulation is to understand what major changes occur in the system then we explore the cascading impacts of the changes on sustainability of these two agricultural systems through a sensitivity analysis two types of sustainability outcomes are displayed groundwater availability of both aquifers and the producer s cash flow for open field and greenhouse farmers 4 results and discussion 4 1 modeling outcomes in this section we use the socio ecological model to describe how current trends for water use and groundwater depletion affect tomato production as well as socio economic aspects 4 1 1 ecological domain groundwater the aquifers dynamics highlight the severity of groundwater over exploitation in both regions see fig 7 in both cases we observe that the reinforcing feedback loops contributing to groundwater use operate faster than the balancing one responsible for groundwater table recharge the groundwater volume balance is not reached leading to a quick depletion process explained by the reinforcing loop r5 that is not balanced by the balancing loop b9 in fig 5 this acceleration is mostly explained by the conversion to drip irrigation and the expansion of intensive farming especially for cash crop production like tomato having thus an impact on water resources as a result the gmp plan to manage sustainably water resources appears to have failed in its initial intentions by having considerably promoted this irrigation practice molle and tanouti 2017b this confirms the concerns regarding a decreasing water balance iglesias et al 2007 malki et al 2017 seif ennasr et al 2016 recharge of the groundwater tables is mostly driven by precipitation and infiltration from irrigation or other water sources like rivers however a water balance can only be achieved in an aquifer through sustainable water management where the volume extracted should be assigned according to the water recharge these graphs inform us on the transition from a regime relying on groundwater table to a regime where this irrigation option could not be available anymore on the other hand even though the same behavior can be observed in both aquifers we found only literature reporting on the chtouka groundwater volume ait brahim et al 2017 hirich 2016 malki et al 2017 walters et al 2018 the rsk region and more particularly the temara groundwater volume has received only little attention in the scientific literature zouahri et al 2014a this raises a concern for the open field producers of the rsk region ultimately our observations regarding future water regimes are alarming for all the systems relying on groundwater based irrigation 4 1 2 socio economic domain producer s cash flow the two different agricultural systems present two different patterns in the face of the same water depletion trend for the open field tomato farmers cash flow increases until 2019 see fig 8 it appears that for today s farmers the benefits from tomato production has resulted from intensive irrigation and production leading to higher incomes molle and tanouti 2017b yet a tipping point is projected to be reached in the coming years leading the cash flow to continuously decrease until reaching back its initial value in 2030 the results show how the investment in irrigation for tomato production cannot cope with the effects of water depletion for both types of producers the balancing loops enacting on irrigation systems see b4 and b4 fig 3 and fig 4 appears to be faster than the two reinforcing loops sustaining production and investment for the cash crop see r1 r1 r5 and r5 fig 3 and fig 4 ultimately the expenses for the production of tomato are not compensated by the prices and profits start to decrease this tipping point is reached a few years before the groundwater decreases to more than 90 of its initial volume the tomato national supply is then higher than the demand and the crop price tends to decrease however the overconsumption of water continues and start to have a direct effect on the production see fig 8 and the yields start to decrease rapidly for the exporter a similar increase of their cash flow over the first 15 years is observed and is directly followed by a drastic decrease over a longer time period however an increase in exporters cash flow is projected after 2030 it is explained by the link between tomato production yield and the profit namely the yield starts to increase again due to the use of fertilizer and its effect on the crop while water availability decreases producers are still using adequate nutrients for the plant at the same time it is observed that the scales for the evolution of the relative cash flow are not the same for each type of producer while exporters are selling to both international and national markets their profit remains higher than the local farmers and despite the groundwater depletion their cash flow could reach 6 times the initial one see fig 8 these results reveal a significant difference between farmers involved in the groundwater economy and goes in line with what has been observed in other regions of the country ameur et al 2017 the results also highlight an increasing gap between the two typologies of farmers this appears as a second argument showing the failure of the strategy of the gmp aiming to uphold domestic agriculture and supporting the most vulnerable farmers a threshold in producers cash flow is reached and the subsequent tipping point indicates the necessity to change the regime in order to enable sustainable outcomes for all producers the cascading effects of water overexploitation on yield and cash flow appears in this model to have long lasting consequences for the producers 4 2 sensitivity analysis in order to have a deeper understanding of the effects of key variables on the system we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses the results of the sensitivity analysis show that for farmers and exporters cash flow at the years 2030 and 2050 are shown in fig 9 the selected 10 exogenous variables of the model were tested under 10 and 10 difference from the baseline scenario depicted in fig 7 and fig 8 the sensitivity analysis shows a minimal effect of a few indicators such as water used per hectare and precipitation on the groundwater table none of the variation of the 10 indicators appear to have a significant effect on the groundwater table in fact in 2030 and 2050 groundwater volume would have already reached its minimal volume see fig 9 the variation from 10 10 of the sensitivity analysis shows the incapacity at that stage to have a significant effect on the groundwater depletion trend it points at the need for bigger endogenous changes or exogenous ones such as alternative water supply for farmers furthermore climate projections suggest that drought events will be more frequent in the future esper et al 2007 kusunose and lybbert 2014 this raises more concerns on groundwater recharge that is mostly driven by precipitation frequent droughts could accelerate water depletion over the coming years to a certain extent these results show how critical the situation is for water resource management and that the variations of only one indicator is not enough to make a change thus our results highlight that actions need to be taken in the coming years in order to prevent the irremediable situation of 2030 moreover the observations from the sensitivity analysis for exporter cash flow see fig 10 show that only an increase in the share of exported tomato and the total tomato consumption per capita could have a positive influence on their cash flow it also appears that positive variations in terms of water supply has negative impacts on the cash flow of the exporters in the long term this is explained by the reinforcing feedback loop of groundwater management see fig 5 r5 the more water is available the more water is used accelerating the process of depletion leading to water shortages before 2030 this has subsequent effects on the yield and thus on the profits from tomato sales this translates the heavy dependence on tomato production of exporters that mostly produce this cash crop and almost solely rely on its profits t7 20 2021 9 47 00 amhe sensitivity tests show a more striking variability for farmer than exporter cash flow in 2030 a raise in tomato market price appears to be one of the best fitted solutions for a cash flow increase this variable raises the role of market structure and its effects on producer cash flow that rely heavily on this cash crop complementary information from the survey see table 2 shows that exporters are mostly linked to both markets moreover farmer cash flow changes are considerable in 2050 we can observe a high variability for each variable e g water used per hectare part of the land allocated to tomato production tomato consumption per captia etc which is explained by the outcome of the baseline scenario farmer cash flow in 2050 is estimated at 9 mad 0 9 usd see fig 10 thus any variation is having a substantial effect on the relative outcome results from the sensitivity analysis shows the advantages of being linked to both markets in terms of cash flow generation on the other hand up to 21 1 of the farmers in rsk region have a seasonal alternative source of income while only 1 2 in the sm region see table 2 this also comes to confirm the vulnerability of open field farmers in face of market price variation results from the sensitivity analysis shows that in order to reach sustainable outcomes for both producer cash flow and groundwater volume there is a necessity to urgently enact on water resource management as well as to combine a set of policies that would effectively support open field farmers toward a long term prosperity while decreasing the considerable gap between the two type of producers 4 3 synthesis and further research opportunities 4 3 1 unsustainable and unequal spillovers the model has shown that the agricultural strategy aiming for an intensification of the production driven by an increase access and use of groundwater has reached a critical limit a tipping point was projected to be reached in the coming years between 2018 and 2023 and another reorganization of the farming and agricultural systems is needed to prevent a collapse for some farmers this shift in the regime arises not only from gradual changes in a single variable but from the interactions e g between water access land use and market access among processes e g production and trading operating at different spatial and temporal scales filatova et al 2016 when addressing the sustainable outcome of this system temporality and reversibility become two major components to address the temporality of the simulation shows how the major changes i e scarce water availability and cash flow operate within a 40 years timeframe a long term overview of the system becomes crucial to anticipate irreversible change when it comes to aquifer management studies have shown the difficulty or sometimes the impossibility to recharge and restore the aquifers reversibility is often viewed with respect to the ecological system whether a previous typically more natural regime can be restored rather than the social ecological system filatova et al 2016 however if we focus on the socio economic sub system maintaining the agricultural activity becomes possible by supplying water from other sources than the groundwater or by implementing more water management practices to this end measures have been taken in the sm region to put in place a decree safeguarding the chtouka aquifer and establish an irrigation perimeter from desalinated water ormvasm 2018 the desalinization plant should provide water to the producers of the region in the coming years however no policy or longer term plan have been announced for the rsk region leaving high concerns for the fate of the most vulnerable farmers 4 3 2 salinity incursions an extension of the model integrating the impacts of agrochemical impacts and saline intrusion on water quality and its effects on the yields and the cash flow over a longer time period could enrich the analysis several studies have reported nitrate pollution issues on water quality in both aquifers studied and the effects it could generate for producers malki et al 2017 zouahri et al 2014b the risks of saline water intrusion are such that already some farmers surveyed in the rsk region mentioned this issue not only vegetable production will be affected but every type of irrigated crop would bare the irreversible consequences of sea water intrusion existing models of salinization on irrigated land reveal that depending on the drainage the groundwater discharge and the groundwater intrusion the salinity reaches alarming levels and with what strategies it can be controlled as an example a common strategy of increasing the drainage in order to control the salinity level yields to growing salinity levels and have a catastrophic result for crop production and agriculture in general saysel and barlas 2001 for the purposes of our project this was not modeled due to the lack of reliable information and sparse data however the model has been shaped in order to be able to add sub modules related to those issues 4 3 3 regime shifts and climate resilience climate change and droughts affecting the country represent also major concerns that have the potential to speed up the process of groundwater depletion ezzine et al 2014 kusunose and lybbert 2014 ouatiki et al 2019 empirical studies on ecosystems have shown that slowly changing conditions can cause quite abrupt changes in the functioning of a system i e regime shifts scheffer and carpenter 2003 for example soil salinization has been reported as an example of regime shift happening in socio ecological systems especially impacting water tables and agricultural production systems anderies et al 2006 biggs et al 2018 under constant changes in environmental ecological political and socioeconomic conditions the likelihood of regime shifts increase and reduce human resilience the combination of various pressures such as coupled water depletion and climate change could make the ecosystems even more vulnerable to changes that could have been absorbed folke et al 2004 walker et al 2004 in this study groundwater depletion leads to a new state that is driven by endogenous gradual change and allows us to project a potential regime shift a regime shift suggests a loss of resilience in that former functions structures feedbacks of the systems cumming and collier 2005 kinzig et al 2006 a combined threat of increasing droughts and a foreseen groundwater depletion questions the resilience of the tomato production system minimizing trade offs and optimizing the sustainability of such system can be a challenging task that requires further analysis of sdm and integrated policy support 5 conclusion we have brought a different perspective on the agricultural situation in two moroccan localities chtouka and temara representing two of the main agricultural regions of the country souss massa and rabat salé kénitra on the one hand this study raises more than ever the awareness about the dynamics of using groundwater in both regions and the consequences of its over exploitation on producers of both regions on the other hand it also enables to draw an alarming conclusion on the implications of the green morocco plan as a strategy aiming to uphold smallholder farmers as well as promoting high added value crop production for export this strategy has failed some rural population by enhancing the socio economic gaps and increasing vulnerability to a vital resource water through the use of sd modelling this study allowed to gather information from stakeholders and literature and captures a more holistic vision of this complex agricultural system multiple methods both quantitative and qualitative allowed to elucidate the effects of the irrigation schemes on the global and local tomato producers the main purpose of this study was to show a how global and local tomato value chains respond to irrigation schemes and b what the environmental consequences are to this extend our study confirms other findings in that the boom in the groundwater economy benefitted entrepreneurial and well endowed farmers oriented towards the global tomato value chain market who made intensive use of groundwater while the effects of the over exploitation of groundwater fed the marginalization of family farmers supplying local tomato value chains we also conclude that there is an urgent need to resolve access to and use of groundwater in the face of declining water tables as the current environmental consequences of the policies in place are alarming socio economic inequalities between exporters and open field farmers remain unaddressed the bond aimed by the gmp between this dual production system has not proven to be build or efficient ultimately this interdisciplinary study addresses agricultural water management in a systemic as well as a systematic manner such approach has been the first one used in the moroccan context and aims to pave the way for further systemic socio ecological studies funding this work was supported by the swiss national excellence scholarship for foreign students grant numbers 2016 0824 marokko

9936,agricultural food production systems are facing the challenging task to provide food and socio economic welfare while preserving natural resources in the long term in morocco the green moroccan plan steered the promotion of groundwater based drip irrigation over the last decade the plan encouraged producers to shift to cash crop production this is how tomato became a main agri food export commodity mostly produced in greenhouses in the souss massa region and produced intensively in open fields for local demand in the northern part of the country however water resources are expected to become particularly scarce over the next decades increasing the vulnerabilities of tomato farmers in face of unforeseen changes and shocks the main purpose of this study is to show a how global and local tomato value chains respond to irrigation schemes and b what the environmental consequences are by means of a system dynamics model and a survey conducted among a sample of 244 producers we describe and outline the major interactions between agricultural ecological and socio economic dimensions of the tomato production systems the results of the model simulations highlight how overexploitation of groundwater tables negatively affects crop production and farmers welfare the model shows that in the near future water scarcity will have long lasting consequences on the producers such as reduced productivity and losses in cash flow our model results highlight that measures need to be taken in the coming years in order to prevent the predicted irremediable water shortage in 2030 we conclude that the current groundwater management will in the long term lead to irreversible groundwater depletion which will enhance already existing inequalities between the two types of producers urgent actions have to be taken in order to sustainably manage water while supporting farmers in the long term keywords agricultural food system system dynamics simulation groundwater management 1 introduction designing policies that ensure food security support social and economic welfare and at the same time preserve natural resources in the long term is challenging historically the prospect of economic growth coupled with agricultural intensification has led to the unsustainable use of resources and environmental degradation in several countries alauddin and quiggin 2008 gohari et al 2013 xu 2001 today long term effects of some policies such as deepening socio economic inequalities and degradation of natural resources can be observed manero 2017 these effects are further exacerbated by climate change and market instabilities among others ouraich et al 2019 rochdane et al 2014 those incremental stresses can lead the system to a regime shift that may evoke large unexpected changes in ecosystem services and human livelihoods scheffer and carpenter 2003 to avoid unanticipated consequences of agricultural policies in the future such as the dependency of some food systems on subsidy programs gerber 2016 it is crucial to investigate the dynamics arising from the complex interrelationships in food and farming systems in countries facing increasing water scarcity suitable water management and more particularly water savings in agriculture becomes a necessity over the last decades governmental water agencies in these countries have encouraged farmers to shift to localized irrigation methods such as drip irrigation to save water groundwater based drip irrigation appeared to be the most secure and reliable solution to provide access to water especially in semi arid and arid areas postel et al 2001 the combination of drip irrigation and trade policies has fostered the intensification of existing farming systems and subsequently high value crops ameur et al 2017 kang et al 2009 such as fresh fruits and vegetables this contributed to the rapid expansion of agri food export production and global food value chains akesbi 2014 paradoxically the conversion to drip irrigation and the shift in cropping patterns has increased the water consumption in morocco molle and tanouti 2017a the extensive groundwater exploitation along with the recent droughts have led to over exploitation of water resources alcalá et al 2015 bekkar et al 2009 thus the design of water resource management policies requires an integrated perspective that considers biophysical and socio economic aspects as well as potential feedbacks associated with the introduction of such policies batchelor et al 2014 berbel and mateos 2014 in the agricultural food production systems operationalizing the interactions between disparate measures of productivity and sustainability necessarily requires an adequate understanding of the complex interactions between environmental social and economic drivers socio ecological systems ses contain a multitude of diverse components interacting non linearly and dynamically in both space and time walters et al 2016 more specifically for water resources management systems it has been argued that the inability to develop sustainable solutions is grounded in the lack of understanding about the interconnections and dynamics of different sub systems davies and simonovic 2011 kotir et al 2016 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 system feedbacks are key mechanisms that influence the sustainability of social ecological systems the system dynamics modelling sdm approach offers a way to gain understanding of an interconnected and complex systems behavior over time and its non linear feedback mechanism kopainsky et al 2017 turner et al 2016 this modeling approach is also a tool to support the design of policies or strategies for improving system performance over time kopainsky et al 2012 kopainsky and luna reyes 2008 sterman 2001 several recent studies have used the sdm approach to develop system dynamic and simulation models in various agricultural systems such as understanding the role of fertilizer subsidy program in zambia to increase maize availability or analyzing food security resilience to climate change in guatemala alifujiang et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 gerber 2016 herrera 2017 xu 2001 the diversity of sdm applications contributed to an improved understanding of the current and future dynamics of water resources management systems for several contexts such as exploring policy scenarios for sustainable water resource management and agricultural development in the volta region in ghana or develop smart groundwater governance in iran barati et al 2019 kotir et al 2016 the tomato production in morocco allows us to explore the complex interplay between agricultural production farmers economic welfare and ecological preservation it becomes relevant to further investigate what are the synergies and trade offs between those three aspects of agroecosystems hence with this study we aim to understand the consequences and the cascading impacts on the socio ecological systems of the irrigation schemes for both global and local tomato producers by using sdm to evaluate the cascading impacts of irrigation on the sustainability of these agricultural systems more concretely we seek to answer to the question what are the different socio ecological implications of the green moroccan plan of both natural resources and humans using sdm enables to highlight the interconnections within this socio ecological system drawing those linkages become then crucial to investigate the disparities between several groups of producers the first section of the paper provides an in depth description of the case study and its specificities based on a literature review and interviews with experts then we present a social ecological system ses model and describe the main modules composing the model using this model we analyze the long term effects of the system with a status quo scenario finally we analyze the outcome of the model and identify the implications of the agricultural irrigation and production strategies with a special focus on the outcomes for agricultural production producer s economic welfare and water resources we chose sdm as a coherent and relevant approach for analyzing complex ses behavior balali et al 2015 stave and kopainsky 2015 2 water governance and a dual agricultural system 2 1 agricultural strategy and water governance in 2008 the moroccan government launched an agricultural strategy the green moroccan plan gmp to rehabilitate agriculture and turn it into the main engine of economic growth and a tool against poverty in morocco this strategy was based on two pillars and was expected to reach both large and small actors along the agricultural value chains the first pillar of the strategy aimed to promote modern agriculture with high added value crops adapted to export markets the second pillar aimed to develop an approach to fight against poverty by significantly increasing agricultural income for the most vulnerable farmers particularly in disadvantaged or peripheral areas plan maroc vert 2008 akesbi 2012 moroccan agriculture has essentially been shaped and divided by these two pillars the differences between these two systems became particularly visible in the fruit and vegetable sector with 517 thousand tons of fresh tomato exported making the crop one of the flagship products for export faostat for 2017 among other targets this latter strategy aims at converting 50 of the moroccan irrigated agricultural land area by 2020 to drip irrigation through a national subsidy program alonso et al 2019 however over the past decade the expected results of this strategy officially ending in 2020 have been widely disputed akesbi 2014 faysse 2015 ouraich and tyner 2018 sippel 2016 previous studies argue on the one hand too much focus on agricultural intensive practices and productivist models to the expense of natural resources preservation on the other hand the subsidies conversion to drip irrigation and the expansion of intensive farming had severe impacts on water contrary to what was announced the latter underlines the need to integrate major challenges related to water management or global competitiveness boudhar et al 2017 schyns and hoekstra 2014 2 2 a dual production system the diversity of horticultural production systems for tomato especially ranges from open field grown systems to greenhouse production systems soil or soil less culture georgios k and maximilin 2017 in morocco exported tomatoes are produced in greenhouses that are extensively mechanized and generates a yield from 120 to 250 t ha 1 wet weight this system benefits from better connection to processing industry and cooperatives that ensure conditioning of the crop and access to export markets around 85 of total tomatoes destined for export are produced in the souss massa region omrvasm 2015 considered as one of the most important agricultural poles 55 of the exported fruits and vegetables are produced in this region in order to meet the european off season demand from september to may this semi arid region is characterized by a low average rainfall of 200 mm year 1 and average temperature of 24 ºc ait brahim et al 2017 malki et al 2017 the high water demand for the crops has led to the over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation purposes the chtouka aquifer located in the region has recorded an annual deficit of 58 60 million m3 per year over the last two decades hirich 2016 malki et al 2017 agricultural productivity has subsequently increased groundwater resources depletion and degradation rates over the last decades payen et al 2014 due to its strategic economic and political importance the region has been extensively studied over the last decades and quantitative information on the water and agricultural situation is available in the scientific and grey literature several studies ait brahim et al 2017 malki et al 2017 showed the groundwater depletion patterns as well as its impacts on the quality of the water in contrast to large export producers smaller producers are growing tomatoes in irrigated open fields from april to october along with other vegetables throughout the year generating lower yields from 40 to 80 t ha 1 see fig 1 for clarity reasons open field smaller producers will be referred to as farmers in the following sections according to the data provided by the ministry of agriculture the rabat sale kénitra rsk region has produced most of the irrigated and open field tomatoes in recent years 73 thousand tons in 2017 dss 2017 rsk is considered as one of the most important areas for fresh fruit and vegetable production such production using drip irrigation has fostered extensive groundwater exploitation for the rsk region we found no studies reporting quantitatively on the depletion of the resources however several studies on morocco and regions close by reported on the groundwater over exploitation and the subsequent issues regarding water quality and availability hirich 2016 malki et al 2017 najib et al 2016 3 material and methods 3 1 simulation approach to investigate the dynamic interactions within the chosen agricultural system we developed a system dynamics model sdm representing the moroccan tomato ses according to repenning 2002 there are two corresponding benefits for the approach to mathematically represent an ses as an sdm first a model allows to implement the internal consistency of the theory and ensures that the behavior it purports to explain can in fact be generated by its underlying assumptions second a model can serve as a sort of a laboratory to test different scenarios into the future thus we developed a sdm model to understand the dynamic interactions between tomato production farmers welfare and groundwater depletion the dynamic behavior arises through a non linear interaction of feedback loops connecting the three following components ecological agricultural and socio economic see fig 2 3 2 data collection the following four step procedure allowed us to capture the specificity of this ses to observe the cause and effect relationships as well as the feedback loops within the system and to gather information for a quantitative representation first an in depth literature review was conducted to develop a modeling framework the framework allows illustrating the system s structure and feedback mechanisms sterman 2001 furthermore the literature review allowed identifying how systems components influence each other i e the polarity of the causality which is essential in understanding system s behavior also we identified drivers that leads to perturbations of a loop that may then amplify the original effect a reinforcing loop r or into an equilibrating response a balancing loop b this first step led to the description of the model through a causal loop diagram second we conducted a series of expert interviews and several field visits which allowed more empirical observations for the interviews we used a semi structured approach which allowed us to validate and quantify the causalities established through the literature review in the first step and also to identify the specificities of the tomato production system the interviews were conducted with agricultural consultants delegates of the ministry of agriculture fisheries rural development water and forests academics farmers and farmers cooperatives see table 2 the first two steps allowed us to establish a modeling framework that is a qualitative statement about a system s structure consequently in a third step this framework was further used as a base for developing and calibrating the quantitative simulation model to get quantitative data to adjust the model a survey among 244 producers was conducted in spring 2018 see table 1 the fourth step of the data collection was based on the formal mathematical simulations run on the modelling framework technically the model consisted of a set of coupled non linear first order integral equations once the model was calibrated and validated see appendix it was used to test the sensitivity of some key indicators and served as a virtual playground in which to test different experiments and scenarios from agricultural management practices to policy implementations the full model was designed using vensim software ventana 2015 3 3 survey outcome the survey informed us on the specificities of the 2 typologies of tomato producers and provided basic information such as average yield in recent seasons farm size area allocated for tomato production irrigation infrastructures links to markets participation in cooperatives and access to other social support moreover the results of the survey provided support for the model analysis and interpretation complementary the survey conducted in 2018 shows the main characteristics and differences between the two types of producers firstly drip irrigation system is used by all producers surveyed water is entirely supplied from wells in the rsk region and in sm region 31 of the producers also use well however the majority of producers extract water from boreholes highlighting there need to pump at deeper level to have access to water then results from the survey indicate that for open field farmers water management practices such as water harvesting techniques are not applied see table 2 only 9 9 are mulching there fields while it has been shown in other mediterranean context that mulching reduces the water footprint of crops more than drip irrigation and when those two practices are combined the effects on water conservations are higher nouri et al 2019 water harvesting techniques are also a key farm management practice to integrate in order to minimize water intake from the groundwater table some farmers surveyed have reported the use of semi circular bunds as a way to collect water run offs an increase soil moisture in the same perspective of increasing the water retention capacities of the soil some farmers have reported the use of compost that is furthermore used as a source of organic fertilizer increasing soil moisture could thus influence positively the recharge of the aquifer however farmer s lack of accountability in water management on the field have been reported in other studies bekkar et al 2009 the slow dynamics arising from groundwater exploitation can compromise farmers acknowledgement of the scope and urgency of the threat in the long run secondly the survey results indicate that tomato production is one of the main sources of income for both type of producers with 96 4 of the producers considering tomato as their main income source in sm region and 58 6 in the rsk region thus 100 of the open field farmers grow other fruits and vegetables showing a certain diversity within their farm only 33 of the greenhouse producers are growing other crops which shows on the other hand the high reliance for tomato as a high value crop however the producers surveyed present also major differences in terms of accessibility to markets while the open field producers in rsk region only have access to local and regional markets the greenhouse producers in sm region have both access to export market and local and regional markets 3 4 modeling framework for explanatory purposes the model is split into modules that explores the socio ecological dynamics in the system versus the natural resources supporting it we present here the main modules in order to explain the underlying links in each of the model outcomes that were chosen as sustainable indicators for this study 3 4 1 socio economic modules the following two sub modules aim to represent the dual agricultural production system for tomato production in the country a typology of two different modes of production and producers have been established in order to describe the situation in the two different regions of the country 3 4 1 1 open field farmers dynamics the farm management sub module is a central part of the model establishing the link between the social ecological structures namely the crop production and the income generation this sub module describes an open field farm producing mostly vegetables as a main source of income incl net revenue from tomato production and other revenues results from the survey indicates that open field farmers are producing other crops the seasonality of tomato production would enable themthe characteristics of the farm management have been designed according to the field observations and the average data from the survey see table 2 it is assumed here that those tomato producers are family farmers and have alternative sources of income different crop production and or off farm activities open field farmers in this specific context only have access to the local and regional markets the main stock represents the farmers cash flow it depends on the net income from tomato production and sales other crop production and other activities see r1 in fig 3 as the cash flow increase farmers can increase their expenditures on machineries or irrigation systems like digging their wells deeper regularly which has a balancing effect of increasing the expenses and decreasing the potential cash flow see b4 in fig 3 3 4 1 2 greenhouse producers dynamics greenhouse production for export requires knowledge in terms of technical expertise but also a different set of infrastructure and thus production costs aloui and kenny 2005 sippel 2016 with an initial capital to start the producing activities exporters can invest in quality inputs labor and mechanized tools to produce a higher yield than open field producers here again three stocks characterize the economic dimension within the farm the farm infrastructure is considered as a stock and is the one enabling producers to invest in the first place on mechanized tools good quality inputs and land to extend their production area exporters tomatoes have to meet certain standards of quality to be able to be exported to european and international markets that explains the high costs of production see fig 4 3 4 2 agricultural and ecological resource modules 3 4 2 1 water and groundwater dynamics this sub module focuses on water management and groundwater use the aquifers of the studied region are represented as stocks inflows to the stock come from upward drainage from deep aquifer river and flood water infiltration percolated water from irrigation and recharge from rainfall abhbc 2012 malki et al 2017 the outflows are water discharges mainly driven by agricultural water consumption indeed in both of the studied region the use of the aquifers is mostly dedicated to irrigation and agricultural production the more water is available in the natural reservoirs the more water is accessible for agriculture and the easier it is to access it but the more water is used for agriculture the less water is left in the natural reservoirs see loop b9 in fig 5 similarly this reinforcing feedback loop occurs for the open field farming region the more water is available and use the higher is the intake for the crop see r5 in fig 5 higher water uptake leads to higher yields than otherwise which eventually contribute to an increase in the household s revenue cash availability can result in irrigation infrastructure expenditure as shown in fig 4 loop b5 the water consumed by the agricultural sector is a minimum function of the maximum water extracted for agricultural purposes and groundwater used for irrigation 3 4 2 2 yield finally another core part of the model represents the interactions between input use and yields the yields for both greenhouse and open field production are dependent on the effect of both water and fertilizer use this agricultural sub module has been elaborated to capture the influence of nutrient and water dynamics on yields gerber 2016 the main reinforcing feedback loop r7 see fig 6 describe the links between agricultural productivity revenues generated by the production and expenses and use of fertilizers and water to increase the production the nutrient uptake is influenced by the fertilization application and soil organic nutrient dynamics the soil sub module captures the main dynamics of the soil organic nitrogen and carbon in the soil soil organic carbon and nitrogen are two stocks linking fertilizers use and the soil dynamics nitrogen plant uptake affects directly the yields and constitutes a natural constraint of how much can be produced r9 for further information see the appendix 3 4 3 modeling timeframe and simulations to simulate the effects we ran the model within a timeframe 2008 2050 on the one hand the model covers the historical behavior of the last decade since the implementation of the gmp in 2008 on the other hand the model is used to simulate the behavior until the year of 2050 the selected timeframe allowed 1 to validate the model by comparing its results to the actual data see methodx and 2 to observe and understand the long term environmental and socio economic processes in this dual tomato production system the first objective of the simulation is to understand what major changes occur in the system then we explore the cascading impacts of the changes on sustainability of these two agricultural systems through a sensitivity analysis two types of sustainability outcomes are displayed groundwater availability of both aquifers and the producer s cash flow for open field and greenhouse farmers 4 results and discussion 4 1 modeling outcomes in this section we use the socio ecological model to describe how current trends for water use and groundwater depletion affect tomato production as well as socio economic aspects 4 1 1 ecological domain groundwater the aquifers dynamics highlight the severity of groundwater over exploitation in both regions see fig 7 in both cases we observe that the reinforcing feedback loops contributing to groundwater use operate faster than the balancing one responsible for groundwater table recharge the groundwater volume balance is not reached leading to a quick depletion process explained by the reinforcing loop r5 that is not balanced by the balancing loop b9 in fig 5 this acceleration is mostly explained by the conversion to drip irrigation and the expansion of intensive farming especially for cash crop production like tomato having thus an impact on water resources as a result the gmp plan to manage sustainably water resources appears to have failed in its initial intentions by having considerably promoted this irrigation practice molle and tanouti 2017b this confirms the concerns regarding a decreasing water balance iglesias et al 2007 malki et al 2017 seif ennasr et al 2016 recharge of the groundwater tables is mostly driven by precipitation and infiltration from irrigation or other water sources like rivers however a water balance can only be achieved in an aquifer through sustainable water management where the volume extracted should be assigned according to the water recharge these graphs inform us on the transition from a regime relying on groundwater table to a regime where this irrigation option could not be available anymore on the other hand even though the same behavior can be observed in both aquifers we found only literature reporting on the chtouka groundwater volume ait brahim et al 2017 hirich 2016 malki et al 2017 walters et al 2018 the rsk region and more particularly the temara groundwater volume has received only little attention in the scientific literature zouahri et al 2014a this raises a concern for the open field producers of the rsk region ultimately our observations regarding future water regimes are alarming for all the systems relying on groundwater based irrigation 4 1 2 socio economic domain producer s cash flow the two different agricultural systems present two different patterns in the face of the same water depletion trend for the open field tomato farmers cash flow increases until 2019 see fig 8 it appears that for today s farmers the benefits from tomato production has resulted from intensive irrigation and production leading to higher incomes molle and tanouti 2017b yet a tipping point is projected to be reached in the coming years leading the cash flow to continuously decrease until reaching back its initial value in 2030 the results show how the investment in irrigation for tomato production cannot cope with the effects of water depletion for both types of producers the balancing loops enacting on irrigation systems see b4 and b4 fig 3 and fig 4 appears to be faster than the two reinforcing loops sustaining production and investment for the cash crop see r1 r1 r5 and r5 fig 3 and fig 4 ultimately the expenses for the production of tomato are not compensated by the prices and profits start to decrease this tipping point is reached a few years before the groundwater decreases to more than 90 of its initial volume the tomato national supply is then higher than the demand and the crop price tends to decrease however the overconsumption of water continues and start to have a direct effect on the production see fig 8 and the yields start to decrease rapidly for the exporter a similar increase of their cash flow over the first 15 years is observed and is directly followed by a drastic decrease over a longer time period however an increase in exporters cash flow is projected after 2030 it is explained by the link between tomato production yield and the profit namely the yield starts to increase again due to the use of fertilizer and its effect on the crop while water availability decreases producers are still using adequate nutrients for the plant at the same time it is observed that the scales for the evolution of the relative cash flow are not the same for each type of producer while exporters are selling to both international and national markets their profit remains higher than the local farmers and despite the groundwater depletion their cash flow could reach 6 times the initial one see fig 8 these results reveal a significant difference between farmers involved in the groundwater economy and goes in line with what has been observed in other regions of the country ameur et al 2017 the results also highlight an increasing gap between the two typologies of farmers this appears as a second argument showing the failure of the strategy of the gmp aiming to uphold domestic agriculture and supporting the most vulnerable farmers a threshold in producers cash flow is reached and the subsequent tipping point indicates the necessity to change the regime in order to enable sustainable outcomes for all producers the cascading effects of water overexploitation on yield and cash flow appears in this model to have long lasting consequences for the producers 4 2 sensitivity analysis in order to have a deeper understanding of the effects of key variables on the system we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses the results of the sensitivity analysis show that for farmers and exporters cash flow at the years 2030 and 2050 are shown in fig 9 the selected 10 exogenous variables of the model were tested under 10 and 10 difference from the baseline scenario depicted in fig 7 and fig 8 the sensitivity analysis shows a minimal effect of a few indicators such as water used per hectare and precipitation on the groundwater table none of the variation of the 10 indicators appear to have a significant effect on the groundwater table in fact in 2030 and 2050 groundwater volume would have already reached its minimal volume see fig 9 the variation from 10 10 of the sensitivity analysis shows the incapacity at that stage to have a significant effect on the groundwater depletion trend it points at the need for bigger endogenous changes or exogenous ones such as alternative water supply for farmers furthermore climate projections suggest that drought events will be more frequent in the future esper et al 2007 kusunose and lybbert 2014 this raises more concerns on groundwater recharge that is mostly driven by precipitation frequent droughts could accelerate water depletion over the coming years to a certain extent these results show how critical the situation is for water resource management and that the variations of only one indicator is not enough to make a change thus our results highlight that actions need to be taken in the coming years in order to prevent the irremediable situation of 2030 moreover the observations from the sensitivity analysis for exporter cash flow see fig 10 show that only an increase in the share of exported tomato and the total tomato consumption per capita could have a positive influence on their cash flow it also appears that positive variations in terms of water supply has negative impacts on the cash flow of the exporters in the long term this is explained by the reinforcing feedback loop of groundwater management see fig 5 r5 the more water is available the more water is used accelerating the process of depletion leading to water shortages before 2030 this has subsequent effects on the yield and thus on the profits from tomato sales this translates the heavy dependence on tomato production of exporters that mostly produce this cash crop and almost solely rely on its profits t7 20 2021 9 47 00 amhe sensitivity tests show a more striking variability for farmer than exporter cash flow in 2030 a raise in tomato market price appears to be one of the best fitted solutions for a cash flow increase this variable raises the role of market structure and its effects on producer cash flow that rely heavily on this cash crop complementary information from the survey see table 2 shows that exporters are mostly linked to both markets moreover farmer cash flow changes are considerable in 2050 we can observe a high variability for each variable e g water used per hectare part of the land allocated to tomato production tomato consumption per captia etc which is explained by the outcome of the baseline scenario farmer cash flow in 2050 is estimated at 9 mad 0 9 usd see fig 10 thus any variation is having a substantial effect on the relative outcome results from the sensitivity analysis shows the advantages of being linked to both markets in terms of cash flow generation on the other hand up to 21 1 of the farmers in rsk region have a seasonal alternative source of income while only 1 2 in the sm region see table 2 this also comes to confirm the vulnerability of open field farmers in face of market price variation results from the sensitivity analysis shows that in order to reach sustainable outcomes for both producer cash flow and groundwater volume there is a necessity to urgently enact on water resource management as well as to combine a set of policies that would effectively support open field farmers toward a long term prosperity while decreasing the considerable gap between the two type of producers 4 3 synthesis and further research opportunities 4 3 1 unsustainable and unequal spillovers the model has shown that the agricultural strategy aiming for an intensification of the production driven by an increase access and use of groundwater has reached a critical limit a tipping point was projected to be reached in the coming years between 2018 and 2023 and another reorganization of the farming and agricultural systems is needed to prevent a collapse for some farmers this shift in the regime arises not only from gradual changes in a single variable but from the interactions e g between water access land use and market access among processes e g production and trading operating at different spatial and temporal scales filatova et al 2016 when addressing the sustainable outcome of this system temporality and reversibility become two major components to address the temporality of the simulation shows how the major changes i e scarce water availability and cash flow operate within a 40 years timeframe a long term overview of the system becomes crucial to anticipate irreversible change when it comes to aquifer management studies have shown the difficulty or sometimes the impossibility to recharge and restore the aquifers reversibility is often viewed with respect to the ecological system whether a previous typically more natural regime can be restored rather than the social ecological system filatova et al 2016 however if we focus on the socio economic sub system maintaining the agricultural activity becomes possible by supplying water from other sources than the groundwater or by implementing more water management practices to this end measures have been taken in the sm region to put in place a decree safeguarding the chtouka aquifer and establish an irrigation perimeter from desalinated water ormvasm 2018 the desalinization plant should provide water to the producers of the region in the coming years however no policy or longer term plan have been announced for the rsk region leaving high concerns for the fate of the most vulnerable farmers 4 3 2 salinity incursions an extension of the model integrating the impacts of agrochemical impacts and saline intrusion on water quality and its effects on the yields and the cash flow over a longer time period could enrich the analysis several studies have reported nitrate pollution issues on water quality in both aquifers studied and the effects it could generate for producers malki et al 2017 zouahri et al 2014b the risks of saline water intrusion are such that already some farmers surveyed in the rsk region mentioned this issue not only vegetable production will be affected but every type of irrigated crop would bare the irreversible consequences of sea water intrusion existing models of salinization on irrigated land reveal that depending on the drainage the groundwater discharge and the groundwater intrusion the salinity reaches alarming levels and with what strategies it can be controlled as an example a common strategy of increasing the drainage in order to control the salinity level yields to growing salinity levels and have a catastrophic result for crop production and agriculture in general saysel and barlas 2001 for the purposes of our project this was not modeled due to the lack of reliable information and sparse data however the model has been shaped in order to be able to add sub modules related to those issues 4 3 3 regime shifts and climate resilience climate change and droughts affecting the country represent also major concerns that have the potential to speed up the process of groundwater depletion ezzine et al 2014 kusunose and lybbert 2014 ouatiki et al 2019 empirical studies on ecosystems have shown that slowly changing conditions can cause quite abrupt changes in the functioning of a system i e regime shifts scheffer and carpenter 2003 for example soil salinization has been reported as an example of regime shift happening in socio ecological systems especially impacting water tables and agricultural production systems anderies et al 2006 biggs et al 2018 under constant changes in environmental ecological political and socioeconomic conditions the likelihood of regime shifts increase and reduce human resilience the combination of various pressures such as coupled water depletion and climate change could make the ecosystems even more vulnerable to changes that could have been absorbed folke et al 2004 walker et al 2004 in this study groundwater depletion leads to a new state that is driven by endogenous gradual change and allows us to project a potential regime shift a regime shift suggests a loss of resilience in that former functions structures feedbacks of the systems cumming and collier 2005 kinzig et al 2006 a combined threat of increasing droughts and a foreseen groundwater depletion questions the resilience of the tomato production system minimizing trade offs and optimizing the sustainability of such system can be a challenging task that requires further analysis of sdm and integrated policy support 5 conclusion we have brought a different perspective on the agricultural situation in two moroccan localities chtouka and temara representing two of the main agricultural regions of the country souss massa and rabat salé kénitra on the one hand this study raises more than ever the awareness about the dynamics of using groundwater in both regions and the consequences of its over exploitation on producers of both regions on the other hand it also enables to draw an alarming conclusion on the implications of the green morocco plan as a strategy aiming to uphold smallholder farmers as well as promoting high added value crop production for export this strategy has failed some rural population by enhancing the socio economic gaps and increasing vulnerability to a vital resource water through the use of sd modelling this study allowed to gather information from stakeholders and literature and captures a more holistic vision of this complex agricultural system multiple methods both quantitative and qualitative allowed to elucidate the effects of the irrigation schemes on the global and local tomato producers the main purpose of this study was to show a how global and local tomato value chains respond to irrigation schemes and b what the environmental consequences are to this extend our study confirms other findings in that the boom in the groundwater economy benefitted entrepreneurial and well endowed farmers oriented towards the global tomato value chain market who made intensive use of groundwater while the effects of the over exploitation of groundwater fed the marginalization of family farmers supplying local tomato value chains we also conclude that there is an urgent need to resolve access to and use of groundwater in the face of declining water tables as the current environmental consequences of the policies in place are alarming socio economic inequalities between exporters and open field farmers remain unaddressed the bond aimed by the gmp between this dual production system has not proven to be build or efficient ultimately this interdisciplinary study addresses agricultural water management in a systemic as well as a systematic manner such approach has been the first one used in the moroccan context and aims to pave the way for further systemic socio ecological studies funding this work was supported by the swiss national excellence scholarship for foreign students grant numbers 2016 0824 marokko

9937,agriculture is required to produce more food while reduce water consumption at the same time to improve the irrigation water use efficiency in agricultural production this study proposed a fuzzy multiobjective optimal modeling approach based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis global evapotranspiration products for optimizing spatial water footprint of crop planting this study attempts to accurately estimate the spatial crop water footprint based on remote sensing information and effectively plan crop planting structure considering conflicting targets spatial water footprint and limited irrigation water resources under fuzzy uncertainty to test its feasibility the proposed approach is employed to a typical semi arid region in northwest china three performance evaluation indicators including synthetic degree sd sustainability index si and approximation degree of ideal objective value ad are applied for measuring model performance and try to give a more comprehensive picture of agricultural land use strategies results show that 1 the remote sensing data can effectively improve the accuracy of water footprint estimation and identify crop planting advantage distribution in spatial 2 the planting area of crops with high evapotranspiration should be increased in irrigation districts near the upstream with high precipitation which can improve economic benefit increase utilization rate of green water and fairness of allocation 3 through optimization the average total blue and gray water footprint among ids are drop while green water utilization rates is raised comparing with status quo 2014 4 water scarcity will not only damage the coordinated development degree of economy society and environment but also hurt the regional sustainable development ability and the realization of development objectives the proposed optimal modeling framework can help optimize the spatial water footprint of crop planting and improve irrigation water use efficiency which can be applied to similar regions that suffer from water scarcity graphical abstract ga1 keywords remote sensing information spatial water footprint fuzzy credibility constrained multiobjective programming optimal crop planting structure irrigation water use efficiency improvement 1 introduction beating number on the live world population clock reminds us that the population on the earth is ceaselessly growing in every second it means that more food and freshwater will be needed to support increasing population predictably how to save water resources and produce more food is a long term problem we need to tackle in the future cai et al 2019 agriculture is the largest freshwater consumption sector accounting for approximately 70 of total global freshwater li et al 2020 it is necessary to propose an efficient agricultural water management practice to reduce irrigation water consumption guarantee regional food security and increase crop yields for sustainable development of agriculture crop planting structure optimization is an effective way to improve agricultural water management standard luo et al 2021 many studies have been reported on optimal crop planting structure under the constraints of water resources and the optimization models have been widely used in dealing with different real world cases zeng et al 2010 su et al 2014 nie et al 2019 he et al 2020 cai et al 2009 liu et al 2009 cai et al 2018 the most commonly used are the interval programming model gui et al 2016 fuzzy programming model dai et al 2021 stochastic programming model li et al 2019a and multiobjective programming mop yu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 among these optimization models fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp showed its good performance in dealing with incomplete knowledge and vagueness of human judgment liu and liu 2002 zhang et al 2018a which are mainly difficulties in optimization to concurrently tackle multiple conflicting targets and fuzziness in the optimization system zhang et al 2018b integrated the mop and fccp model into one framework resulting in fccmop model such model was proved as a useful tool in agricultural water management but these applications usually simplify the spatial information as point values tang et al 2019 the spatial diversities of crop growth features and precipitation conditions were rarely reported in previous studies virtual water theory is always regarded as a useful tool to address above problem the virtual water means the quantities of water needed to produce products allan 1998 and can be divided as blue green and gray water footprint according to source and usage of water dai et al 2021 blue and green water footprint respectively refers to the consumption of blue water surface water and groundwater resources and green water rainwater that would not be runoff within agricultural production grey water footprint is defined as the volume of fresh water needed to assimilate a certain pollutant load based on the natural background concentration and the existing environmental water quality standards generally virtual water theory is used for broadening the geographical scope of optimal water allocation and finally help address water shortage and food security through trade moreover some studies realized that crop water requirement is not only the characteristics of crop itself but also depends on the environmental characteristics of crop planting location indicating that the various composition of crop virtual water in different areas reflects the planting advantages of crops li et al 2019a for example improvement of the utilization rate of green water or reduction of blue water usage in crop planting structure planning can save irrigation water without reducing crop yield su et al 2014 which has vital meaning for food security and sustainable development of arid and semi arid regions however because of the limited ground meteorological stations the spatial variability of hydrometeorological data used in calculating water footprint cannot be well reflected which inevitably affects the estimation accuracy of crop water footprint the accurate and meticulous description of its spatial variability contributes to formulate a water saving crop planting structure and improve irrigation water use efficiency with the wide application of 3s technology including remote sensing geography information systems and global position system more spatial information was provided to agricultural water management practice it has gradually become one of research hotspots to gain spatiotemporal data using remote sensing information in agricultural water management for example garrido rubio et al 2020 employed the remote sensing based soil water balance method to irrigation water accounting and results demonstrated that such method can offer reproducible and reliable mapped estimations filgueiras et al 2020 used remote sensing data to estimate soil water content and actual evapotranspiration tang et al 2019 2020 generated spatial actual evapotranspiration and precipitation of irrigation districts via regression model and remote sensing data such studies successfully helped water managers understand the spatial variability of key factors in agricultural water management which inspired us that the spatial water footprint of crops can be generated based on remote sensing data nevertheless few studies have reported the remote sensing based crop water footprint estimation therefore this paper aims to propose a novel modeling approach coupling remote sensing based water footprint accounting for optimally configuring crop planting area the paper is expected to deal with following problems 1 how to accurately estimate the spatial crop water footprint based on remote sensing information 2 how to effectively plan crop planting structure considering conflicting targets spatial water footprint and limited irrigation water resources under fuzzy uncertainty the proposed approach is applied to a real world case study and optimal alternatives of crop planting structure are generated which guide decision makers plan crop planting structure to response the changing environment and improve water use efficiency then the effectiveness of the multi objective model from three aspects of indicators including coordination degree sustainable development ability and goal realization degree is examined the remote sensing based water footprint accounting and fccmop modeling method for optimizing crop planting structure will be introduced in section 2 in detail section 3 will present the study area the middle reaches of heihe river basin in northwest china and its data collection section 4 will analyze the results obtained by solving the optimization model section 5 draws some conclusions and suggests extensions 2 material and methods 2 1 remote sensing based water footprint calculation to account spatial crop water footprint in different irrigation districts spatial hydrological information will be first obtained via remote sensing data processing this section consists of several parts including spatial et 0 and precipitation acquisition based on remote sensing data and water footprint calculation according to the study by tang et al 2019 the spatial et 0 information of each irrigation district id can be generated with the help of remote sensing data the spatial et 0 acquisition process is shown as fig 1 in detail the spatial precipitation data can be obtained via spatial interpolation methods such as kriging interpolation method inverse distance weight method etc according to the statistical data from local meteorological stations he et al 2018 and the average precipitation of each id can be generated through conducting the mask extraction according to ids map after obtaining the spatial et 0 and precipitation of each id the water footprint can be estimated

programming fccmop for optimizing agricultural land use through integrating fuzzy credibility constrained programming and multiobjective programming zhang et al 2018b a fuzzy credibility constrained multiobjective programming fccmop model with three objectives including economic social and environmental benefits is developed in this section objectives and constraints of fccmop will be detailed discussed in the following parts 2 2 1 objectives of fccmop 1 economic benefit objective maximize economic benefits the pursuit of maximum economic benefits is the most important factor to promote farmers to grow crops by subtracting the cost of planting from the sale of agricultural products in the market the economic benefit of planting area can be obtained the economic benefit can be expressed as follows 4a m a x f 1 i 1 i j 1 j e b i j 4b e b i j a i j y i j m p j p i w a t a i j i q i j c o s t o f w a t e r p f e r n j f e r a i j c o s t o f f e r t i l i z e r i j where eb ij

market price of crop j cny kg p i w a t is the cost of water use in irrigation district i cny m3 iq ij is the irrigation water of crop j in irrigation district i m3 ha p fer is the market price of fertilizer cny kg 2 social benefit objective minimize gini coefficient the fairness of resource allocation is farmers most concerned problem li et al 2019a when planting area planning farmers always want to get the similar income as others in this study the fairness is considered as equilibrium of the economic benefit per unit area which can be reflected by gini coefficient zhang et al 2020 the smaller gini coefficient is the better fairness is so the second objective can be displayed as follows 4c m i n f 2 1 2 i i 1 i j 1 j e b i j j 1 j a i j i 1 1 i 1 i 2 1 i 2 j 1 j e b i 1 j j 1 j a i 1 j j 1 j e b i 2 j j 1 j a i 2 j 3 environmental benefit objective maximize green water utilization rate green water is highly immobile meaning that it is difficult to replace other water as the water demand of crops mainly consist of green and blue water making full use of green water can definitely save blue water su et al 2014 and thus more water can be used to guarantee the health of regional eco environment thus third objective is to maximize the proportion of green water utilization for saving irrigation water resources which can be denoted as follows 4d m a x f 3 i 1 i j 1 j a i j y i j g n i j i 1 i j 1 j a i j y i j w f i j 100 4e w f i j g n i j b e i j g y i j i j 2 2 2 constraints of fccmp 1 available water constraint 4f c r i 1 i j 1 j a i j i q i j a s η f η c a g η

model the confliction of multiple objectives and complexity of fuzzy credibility constraints must be tackled according to the algorithms for solving these two kinds of programming zhang et al 2018b the solving method of fccmop can be obtained as following steps 1 transform the fuzzy credibility constraints as normal constraints the fuzzy credibility constraints include two types expressed as c r a x b α and c r c x d β where a and c are coefficients α and β are the are confidence level b b b b and d d d d are right hand side fuzzy coefficients according to the fccp algorithm dai et al 2021 when the fuzzy credibility constraint has the form of c r a x b α it can be transformed as a x b 1 2 α b b and c r c x d β can be transformed as c x d 2 β 1 d d with the help of these equations fccmop can be transformed as multiobjective programming mop model with normal constraints 2 transform mop model as a single objective model there are many algorithms solving mop models and their main solution thinking is to build a new single objective model based on original mop model osman et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b among these solution method minimum deviation method mdm has been widely used in this step due to its simple formula structure according to mdm best value f 1 b f 2 b f 3 b and worst value f 1 w f 2 w f 3 w of each objective under the constraints should be first calculated then the multiple objectives in this study can be integrated as a single objective through following equation 5 f ω 1 f 1 b e s t f 1 f 1 b e s t f 1 w o r s t ω 2 f 1 f 2 b e s t f 2 w o r s t f 2 b e s t ω 3 f 3 b e s t f 3 f 3 b e s t f 3 w o r s t where ɷ 1 ɷ 2 and ɷ 3 are important weights of each objective which is usually obtained by analytic hierarchy process ahp method zhang et al 2020 3 generate optimization results after above processing fccmop model have been converted as a single objective model with normal constraints which can be easily coded in the lingo software 2 3 model performance evaluation method some indicators are involved to measure the model performance economic benefit is the total net economic income of farmers in agricultural production which can be estimated through eqs 4a and 4b the benefit per unit water is defined as the ratio of total economic benefit to total irrigation water the water productivity is defined as the ratio of total yield to total irrigation water the utilization rate benefit per unit water and water productivity are the indicators reflecting water use efficiency the benefit per unit water and water productivity are respectively defined as the ratio of total economic benefit to total irrigation water and the ratio of total yield to total irrigation water the relative deviation rd reflect the change of optimized value relative to status quo which is defined as 6 r d v v v 100 where v and v are the optimization and original value respectively additionally to exam the performance of proposed model in dealing with multiple objectives three indexes including synthetic degree sd sustainability index si and approximation degree of ideal objective value ad are involved for evaluating the comprehensive performance of optimization model the computation equations and the parameter meanings of these three indicators can be found in table 1 the framework of this study can be found in fig 2 providing the detailed steps of generating crop structure planting strategies 3 application 3 1 study area the study area is the middle reaches of heihe river basin mrhrb located in gansu province northwestern china 98 00 100 55 e 38 50 40 00 n fig 3 the mrhrb is featured as semi arid climate belonging to bsk in köppen climate classification it lies between yingluo gorge hydrological station and zhengyi gorge hydrological station it is consisted of three administrative regions which can be divided as 17 irrigation districts as table 2 shows as a typical semi arid region mrhrb has high evaporation above 1000 mm water turns into vapor and enters the atmosphere per year and low precipitation below 250 mm per year over the year while it is a crucial agricultural production base of china from earliest times to the present day with the population growth industrial development and scale expansion of agricultural production mrhrb faces the intense contradiction between water supply and demand the increasing water consumption of middle reaches reduces the available water of the lower reaches and seriously endangers its ecological health leading to the lake disappear the groundwater level decrease and the desertification the lower reaches of heihe river basin even became one of the main sources of sandstorm in china agriculture is the pillar industry in the mrhrb and the largest water use sector accounting for over 90 of the total water consumption the practical problem faced by local water managers is to ensure agricultural production and reduce the consumption of water resources simultaneously 3 2 data collection wheat seed corn field corn and vegetables are the main crops of the mrhrb whose planting area occupy over 80 of the total cultivated land thus these crops are selected as research crops in this study this study set 2014 as the typical year to apply proposed approach to mrhrb many data were collected through field surveys official reports relevant literatures and websites first mod16 pet product in 2010 2014 was downloaded from the website of national aeronautics and space administration nasa https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov according to the latitude and longitude of the study area then the china monthly precipitation value 0 5 0 5 grid data set v2 0 of the study area in 2014 and meteorological station data of zhangye linze and gaotai during 2004 2014 were downloaded from china meteorological data service center http data cma cn en according to the field research in mrhrb available surface water and groundwater resources for irrigating these crops are 8 68 9 77 11 73 and 1 05 2 45 2 94 108 m3 respectively water leakage coefficient of canal and field are 0 66 and 0 80 respectively li et al 2019a regional price of fertilizer is 2 42 cny kg the market price of water in gz lz and gt are 0 08 0 04 and 0 05 cny m3 respectively wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 annual food demand of every people is set as 400 kg referring to data from the chinese dietary guidelines 2016 table 3 shows the monthly comprehensive crop coefficients kc market price and dosage of fertilizer use of research crops table 4 provides the population of each id crop yield irrigation quota and planting area 2014 in different ids 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 spatial et0 and precipitation as fig 3 shows there are three meteorological stations in the study area after calculating the monthly et 0 value and extracting the monthly mod16 pet value of these meteorological stations during 2004 2014 linze station only use the meteorological statistics during 2004 2009 because of data missing the corresponding values of two data series at three meteorological stations can be drawn as fig 4 shows then the functional relationship between these two parameters were determined to avoid the negative values of pm et0 the intercepts were set as zero we found that quadratic model has good performance at ganzhou and gaotai meteorological station while linear model performs well at linze meteorological station with the help of these functional equations and mod16 pet data set the spatial et 0 of each administrative region can be generated fig 5 shows the et 0it and monthly average et 0 indicating that the value of et 0 in the area near the upstream is small and that in the area near the downstream is large such findings in line with geographical features of study area where the upper reaches have higher altitude and vegetation coverage while the lower reaches have lower altitude and vegetation coverage finally the actual evapotranspiration et c of each crop in different ids during crop growth period et cijt were generated through eq 2 and the calculation results are displayed in fig 6 as for spatial precipitation data the values within the latitude and longitude 98 30 101 30 e 38 00 40 30 n of the study area were intercepted and 30 values were found within this area then kriging interpolation method was applied to this area and the spatial precipitation data can be generated after using the mask extraction and average value calculation the precipitation of each id during april to september can be obtained the monthly precipitation of each id and total precipitation during crop growth period in 2014 are displayed in the fig 7 it can be found that the precipitation of the ids near the upstream is greater than ids near the downstream 4 2 spatial water footprint accounting after inputting above data into eqs 1a 1d the crop water footprint of each id during whole growth period in 2014 can be estimated and the footprint results are shown in fig 8 not surprisingly due to the semi arid features of study area blue water footprint is the major component of the total water footprint accounting for around 50 90 for each crop in different ids gray water footprint only occupies about 0 05 0 11 among total water footprint for each crop in different ids indicating that the amounts of pollutants produced by fertilization is small as fig 8 shows luocheng id has the highest blue water footprint while its green and gray water footprint are almost the smallest the reasons why that happens are 1 luocheng id is near the downstream with higher evapotranspiration and less precipitation 2 the crop yield in this id is higher than others 3 the fertilizer usage in gaotai county the administrative region that luocheng id belongs to is the smallest among three administrative regions besides because the green water footprint is greatly affected by precipitation ids near upstream with large precipitation have larger green water footprint value for crops there are significantly difference of the water footprints in different ids in fig 8 it is noteworthy that vegetables have lowest blue green gray and total water footprint owing to their highest crop yield among all crops the gray water footprint of field corn is higher than seed corn because the fertilizer usage of field corn is more than seed corn in whole planting process the water footprint information showed in fig 8 provides clear virtual water structure of each crop from different ids in agricultural production demonstrating that integration of the remote sensing information and cropwat model was a meaningful attempt to estimate the spatial distribution of blue and green water footprint at regions with scarce ground meteorological stations the relevant studies in water footprint calculation can hardly guarantee the accuracy via applying point value to the entire area su et al 2014 yue and guo 2021 or conducting spatial interpolation with several points tang et al 2020 the results obtained in this section can support agricultural water managers adjust the crop planting structure to improve water use efficiency thus this information has been input into the fccmop model to further generate the optimization alternatives of crop planting structure 4 3 optimization results analysis three credibility levels of β including 0 55 0 75 and 0 95 are considered in this study after solving the optimization model through the algorithm in 2 3 section the optimization results of crop planting structure can be generated as table 5 shows the optimization results indicate that the change of credibility level would lead to the somewhat difference among the optimal crop planting structures with the credibility level increasing from 0 55 to 0 75 the total crop planting area in the study area are decreasing according to the solution method of credibility constraint programming the higher the credibility the stronger the robustness of the system different credibility levels represent the different estimation of available water resources and higher credibility level means less available water and land resources which will lead to fierce competition among different crops for example in dm id the resources reduction pressure of irrigation water and land is mainly alleviated by reducing corn planting area especially seed corn about 37 of seed corn planting area in dm id is reduced when the credibility level change from 0 55 to 0 95 although the planting benefit of seed corn is higher than wheat and field optimization results indicate that the food security is the first consideration under the extreme shortage of water resources which well meets the basic requirements of regional crop planting structure planning moreover comparing the status quo in table 4 and optimization results of crop planting area it is noteworthy that the planting area of wheat are reduced in most of the ids owing to its large water demand except ay lc lb xb and hyz the increase planting area of wheat in these exceptions is mainly caused by two reasons high yield such as lc lb xb and hyz id and less irrigation water demand ay id we found that regional governments have made some attempts to reduce the planting area of wheat for saving more irrigation water in field investigation at the study area however wheat is an important staple food for chinese people living in northwest china and thus decision makers face difficulty in balancing the food security and water saving when reducing the planting area of wheat the obtained optimization results in this study remind local decision makers that it is not necessary to reduce the wheat planting area in all irrigation areas for saving irrigation water resources and planting wheat in some advantage area can help solve such problem field corn is staple food closely related to food security and the planting area of field corn can be adjusted dynamically according to available water amounts as a major cash crop in the mrhrb seed corn has obviously advantage among all crops the information in table 5 indicates that the planting scale of seed corn can be further expanded when the available water is abundant vegetables is another advantage crop and its planting area can be expanded to improve farmers income when food security is not affected table 6 displays key indicators that are usually concerned by regional decision makers in crop planting structure planning comparing with status quo all indicators have been significantly improved through optimization model especially for three optimization objectives of fccmop total economic benefit value of status quo is 74 46 108 cny which is lower than optimization results under different credibility level the total economic benefit under credibility of 0 55 0 75 and 0 95 are 88 15 82 35 and 75 06 108 cny respectively gini coefficient of optimization results under different credibility 0 10 0 11 and 0 12 are lower than status quo it can be found that regional water use efficiency has been effectively improved through optimization when the credibility level increased the economic benefit in most ids is cut down which has the same change trend with total planting area on the contrary other two indicators of water use efficiency benefit per unit water and water productivity increase with the improvement of credibility level indicating water deficit can improve water use efficiency to some extent besides the comparison of total footprint between status quo and optimization results shows that the optimal crop planting structure can save more water to obtain same yield in agricultural production which contributes to the sustainable development of arid and semi arid regions as mrhrb fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of total water footprint and its components under three credibility level and status quo in each id through which the dynamic change of regional water footprint can be clearly reflected the darker color of the id denotes the higher value of water footprint when water deficit occurs credibility level raising it is found that the total water footprint of large ids such as dm yk lyh and etc are drop but there is an increasing trend in small ids such as yn lq sh and etc indicating that large ids has stronger bearing capacity for water shortage with more space for planting structure adjustment the change of water footprint is affected by crop yield evapotranspiration and precipitation of each id especially for green water footprint its spatial distribution has high similarity with precipitation ids near the upstream have higher green water footprint than others while the blue water footprint has almost the opposite trend moreover it appears that xj and ss have the highest gray water footprint among ids this is mainly because the lowest proportion of vegetables planted in these two ids while the yield of vegetables is much higher than that of other crops through making the comparison between existing condition and optimal results it is also found that spatial distribution has obviously change to clearly display the changes brought by optimization the detailed comparison of water footprint between existing condition 2014 and optimal results under credibility of 0 75 the blue water usage and total planting area in 2014 is near the credibility level of 0 75 table 7 shows the comparison of water footprint between status quo and optimal results β 0 75 it is noteworthy that the total blue and gray water footprint in most ids is drop while green water utilization rates are raising however lb and lc id have the opposite trend with these ids the total planting area of wheat and field corn in these two ids have been expended to guarantee food security of the study area but it comes at the cost of reducing the planting area of vegetables and seed corn with high economic benefits and yield resulting in the water footprint raising that is these two ids have advantage in planting food crops with high water demand and low income and local managers should formulate corresponding policies to increase the planting area of food crops in such areas to save irrigation water resources with the help of this information local decision makers of agricultural production can estimate the allocation efficiency of different crop planting strategies and determining better agricultural land use practice 4 4 performance analysis of fccmop model to identify the performance of fccmop model in dealing with multiple objectives three new optimization model with single objective are built based on fccmop model as table 8 shows these models have the same constraints as fccmop after solving the model 1 2 and 3 the optimal results and corresponding objective values were generated then the values of sd si and ad were calculated based on the computation equations in table 1 and the performance comparisons between single objective models and fccmop model were made with the help of three indicators the comparison results are displayed in fig 10 comparing the indicators of status quo with the optimal results under the credibility level of β 0 75 it is found that all optimization models can effectively improve the value of these three indexes especially compared with single objective models fccmop model shows obvious advantages in most indicators under each credibility level indicating that fccmop can well deal with the conflicting contradictions among configuration objectives of different dimensions it is noteworthy that model 2 shows the better performance in ad index which may be due to the relatively large variation of gini coefficient calculated by different models besides by comparing the optimal results under different credibility level the decreased trend is found in value of sd si and ad with the increase of credibility level this suggests that water deficit will not only damage the coordinated development degree of economy society and environment but also hinder the regional sustainable development ability and the realization of development objectives the performance examines illustrated that the fccmop model could successfully make synergic control of multiple water allocation objectives in optimizing and make full use of remote sensing based spatial water footprint information which were rarely considered in similar studies dai et al 2021 li et al 2019b the indicators using for identifying model performance including sd si and ad can provide support for the evaluation of agricultural land use strategies the real world application indicated that the proposed approach has advantages in 1 fully reflecting the spatial variability of crop water footprint 2 successfully dealing with multiple conflicting objectives and fuzziness in planning crop planting 3 well evaluating the comprehensive performance of the optimization schemes from three aspects besides the mod16 pet data spatial precipitation data and meteorological station data are usually easily accessible from the website which make this approach more easy to apply in practical agricultural water management than others however it is notable that many relevant data such as crop yield and growth period still have to be collected through field survey for calculating water footprint and optimization such data is expected to be collected through some new technologies such as remote sensing in the future for fully reflecting spatiotemporal variability of data besides as a complex system crop planting area structure optimization include multiple uncertainties such as random fuzzy interval and their interactions these uncertainties should be considered in the future optimization model formulation to improve the practicability and effectiveness of the optimal results 5 conclusions this paper developed a novel optimal modeling approach for planning crop planting structure to improve water use efficiency and ensure the harmoniously development of economic social and environmental benefit considering the spatial distribution of water footprint through the optimization the optimal results under scenarios of water deficit β 0 55 status quo β 0 75 and water abundant β 0 95 can be generated which can provide the adjustment directions of regional crop planting planning to respond the dynamic available irrigation water resources the approach used in this study can help policy makers plan crop planting structure in an efficient manner three performance evaluation indicators including synthetic degree sd sustainability index si and approximation degree of ideal objective value ad can give a more comprehensive picture of agricultural land use strategies these will contribute to water scarcity remission and the sustainable development in arid and semi arid regions from the application to the middle reaches of heihe river basin the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the remote sensing data can effectively improve the accuracy of water footprint estimation and identify crop planting advantage distribution in spatial 2 the planting area of crops with high evapotranspiration should be increased in irrigation districts near the upstream where the precipitation is higher than others which can improve economic benefit and utilization rate of green water by 10 59 and 3 96 respectively while reduced gini coefficient by 23 94 3 through optimization the average total blue and gray water footprint among ids are drop by 5 45 5 91 and 4 70 while green water utilization rates is raised by 3 96 comparing with status quo 2014 4 water scarcity will not only damage the coordinated development degree of economy society and environment but also hurt the regional sustainable development ability and the realization of development objectives this approach was portable and practical for finding optimal crop planting structure considering spatial water footprint of crops remote sensing data utilization objective functions and constraints formulation and solution method in this study can serve as a reference for crop planting structure planning in similar regions however some research limitations as mentioned in the results

9937,agriculture is required to produce more food while reduce water consumption at the same time to improve the irrigation water use efficiency in agricultural production this study proposed a fuzzy multiobjective optimal modeling approach based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis global evapotranspiration products for optimizing spatial water footprint of crop planting this study attempts to accurately estimate the spatial crop water footprint based on remote sensing information and effectively plan crop planting structure considering conflicting targets spatial water footprint and limited irrigation water resources under fuzzy uncertainty to test its feasibility the proposed approach is employed to a typical semi arid region in northwest china three performance evaluation indicators including synthetic degree sd sustainability index si and approximation degree of ideal objective value ad are applied for measuring model performance and try to give a more comprehensive picture of agricultural land use strategies results show that 1 the remote sensing data can effectively improve the accuracy of water footprint estimation and identify crop planting

irrigation water use efficiency which can be applied to similar regions that suffer from water scarcity graphical abstract ga1 keywords remote sensing information spatial water footprint fuzzy credibility constrained multiobjective programming optimal crop planting structure irrigation water use efficiency improvement 1 introduction beating number on the live world population clock reminds us that the population on the earth is ceaselessly growing in every second it means that more food and freshwater will be needed to support increasing population predictably how to save water resources and produce more food is a long term problem we need to tackle in the future cai et al 2019 agriculture is the largest freshwater consumption sector accounting for approximately 70 of total global freshwater li et al 2020 it is necessary to propose an efficient agricultural water management practice to reduce irrigation water consumption guarantee regional food security and increase crop yields for sustainable development of agriculture crop planting structure optimization is an effective way to improve agricultural water management standard luo et al 2021 many studies have been

stochastic programming model li et al 2019a and multiobjective programming mop yu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 among these optimization models fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp showed its good performance in dealing with incomplete knowledge and vagueness of human judgment liu and liu 2002 zhang et al 2018a which are mainly difficulties in optimization to concurrently tackle multiple conflicting targets and fuzziness in the optimization system zhang et al 2018b integrated the mop and fccp model into one framework resulting in fccmop model such model was proved as a useful tool in agricultural water management but these applications usually simplify the spatial information as point values tang et al 2019 the spatial diversities of crop growth features and precipitation conditions were rarely reported in previous studies virtual water theory is always regarded as a useful tool to address above problem the virtual water means the quantities of water needed to produce products allan 1998 and can be divided as blue green and gray water footprint according to source and usage of water dai et al 2021 blue and green water footprint respectively refers to the consumption of blue water surface water and groundwater resources and green water rainwater that would not be runoff within agricultural production grey water footprint is defined as the volume of fresh water needed to assimilate a certain pollutant load based on the natural background concentration and the existing environmental water quality standards generally virtual water theory is used for broadening the geographical scope of optimal water allocation and finally help address water shortage and food security through trade moreover some studies realized that crop water requirement is not only the characteristics of crop itself but also depends on the environmental characteristics of crop planting location indicating that the various composition of crop virtual water in different areas reflects the planting advantages of crops li et al 2019a for example improvement of the utilization rate of green water or reduction of blue water usage in crop planting structure planning can save irrigation water without reducing crop yield su et al 2014 which has vital meaning for food security and sustainable development of arid and semi arid regions however because of the limited ground meteorological stations the spatial variability of hydrometeorological data used in calculating water footprint cannot be well reflected which inevitably affects the estimation accuracy of crop water footprint the accurate and meticulous description of its spatial variability contributes to formulate a water saving crop planting structure and improve irrigation water use efficiency with the wide application of 3s technology including remote sensing geography information systems and global position system more spatial information was provided to agricultural water management practice it has gradually become one of research hotspots to gain spatiotemporal data using remote sensing information in agricultural water management for example garrido rubio et al 2020 employed the remote sensing based soil water balance method to irrigation water accounting and results demonstrated that such method can offer reproducible and reliable mapped estimations filgueiras et al 2020 used remote sensing data to estimate soil water content and actual evapotranspiration tang et al 2019 2020 generated spatial actual evapotranspiration and precipitation of irrigation districts via regression model and remote sensing data such studies successfully helped water managers understand the spatial variability of key factors in agricultural water management which inspired us that the spatial water footprint of crops can be generated based on remote sensing data nevertheless few studies have reported the remote sensing based crop water footprint estimation therefore this paper aims to propose a novel modeling approach coupling remote sensing based water footprint accounting for optimally configuring crop planting area the paper is expected to deal with following problems 1 how to accurately estimate the spatial crop water footprint based on remote sensing information 2 how to effectively plan crop planting structure considering conflicting targets spatial water footprint and limited irrigation water resources under fuzzy uncertainty the proposed approach is applied to a real world case study and optimal alternatives of crop planting structure are generated which guide decision makers plan crop planting structure to response the changing environment and improve water use efficiency then the effectiveness of the multi objective model from three aspects of indicators including coordination degree sustainable development ability and goal realization degree is examined the remote sensing based water footprint accounting and fccmop modeling method for optimizing crop planting structure will be introduced in section 2 in detail section 3 will present the study area the middle reaches of heihe river basin in northwest china and its data collection section 4 will analyze the results obtained by solving the optimization model section 5 draws some conclusions and suggests extensions 2 material and methods 2 1 remote sensing based water footprint calculation to account spatial crop water footprint in different irrigation districts spatial hydrological information will be first obtained via remote sensing data processing this section consists of several parts including spatial et 0 and precipitation acquisition based on remote sensing data and water footprint calculation according to the study by tang et al 2019 the spatial et 0 information of each irrigation district id can be generated with the help of remote sensing data the spatial et 0 acquisition process is shown as fig 1 in detail the spatial precipitation data can be obtained via spatial interpolation methods such as kriging interpolation method inverse distance weight method etc according to the statistical data from local meteorological stations he et al 2018 and the average precipitation of each id can be generated through conducting the mask extraction according to ids map after obtaining the spatial et 0 and precipitation of each id the water footprint can be estimated through cropwat model dai et al 2021 hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 1a w f i j g n i j b e i j g y i j 1b g n i j v w i j g n y i j 10 e t g i j y i j 10 t 1 t min e t c i j t e p i t

programming fccmop for optimizing agricultural land use through integrating fuzzy credibility constrained programming and multiobjective programming zhang et al 2018b a fuzzy credibility constrained multiobjective programming fccmop model with three objectives including economic social and environmental benefits is developed in this section objectives and constraints of fccmop will be detailed discussed in the following parts 2 2 1 objectives of fccmop 1 economic benefit objective maximize economic benefits the pursuit of maximum economic benefits is the most important factor to promote farmers to grow crops by subtracting the cost of planting from the sale of agricultural products in the market the economic benefit of planting area can be obtained the economic benefit can be expressed as follows 4a m a x f 1 i 1 i j 1 j e b i j 4b e b i j a i j y i j m p j p i w a t a i j i q i j c o s t o f w a t e r p f e r n j f e r a i j c o s t o f f e r t i l i z e r i j where eb ij

market price of crop j cny kg p i w a t is the cost of water use in irrigation district i cny m3 iq ij is the irrigation water of crop j in irrigation district i m3 ha p fer is the market price of fertilizer cny kg 2 social benefit objective minimize gini coefficient the fairness of resource allocation is farmers most concerned problem li et al 2019a when planting area planning farmers always want to get the similar income as others in this study the fairness is considered as equilibrium of the economic benefit per unit area which can be reflected by gini coefficient zhang et al 2020 the smaller gini coefficient is the better fairness is so the second objective can be displayed as follows 4c m i n f 2 1 2 i i 1 i j 1 j e b i j j 1 j a i j i 1 1 i 1 i 2 1 i 2 j 1 j e b i 1 j j 1 j a i 1 j j 1 j e b i 2 j j 1 j a i 2 j 3 environmental benefit objective maximize green water utilization rate green water is highly immobile meaning that it is difficult to replace other water as the water demand of crops mainly consist of green and blue water making full use of green water can definitely save blue water su et al 2014 and thus more water can be used to guarantee the health of regional eco environment thus third objective is to maximize the proportion of green water utilization for saving irrigation water resources which can be denoted as follows 4d m a x f 3 i 1 i j 1 j a i j y i j g n i j i 1 i j 1 j a i j y i j w f i j 100 4e w f i j g n i j b e i j g y i j i j 2 2 2 constraints of fccmp 1 available water constraint 4f c r i 1 i j 1 j a i j i q i j a s η f η c a g η

model the confliction of multiple objectives and complexity of fuzzy credibility constraints must be tackled according to the algorithms for solving these two kinds of programming zhang et al 2018b the solving method of fccmop can be obtained as following steps 1 transform the fuzzy credibility constraints as normal constraints the fuzzy credibility constraints include two types expressed as c r a x b α and c r c x d β where a and c are coefficients α and β are the are confidence level b b b b and d d d d are right hand side fuzzy coefficients according to the fccp algorithm dai et al 2021 when the fuzzy credibility constraint has the form of c r a x b α it can be transformed as a x b 1 2 α b b and c r c x d β can be transformed as c x d 2 β 1 d d with the help of these equations fccmop can be transformed as multiobjective programming mop model with normal constraints 2 transform mop model as a single objective model there are many algorithms solving mop models and their main solution thinking is to build a new single objective model based on original mop model osman et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b among these solution method minimum deviation method mdm has been widely used in this step due to its simple formula structure according to mdm best value f 1 b f 2 b f 3 b and worst value f 1 w f 2 w f 3 w of each objective under the constraints should be first calculated then the multiple objectives in this study can be integrated as a single objective through following equation 5 f ω 1 f 1 b e s t f 1 f 1 b e s t f 1 w o r s t ω 2 f 1 f 2 b e s t f 2 w o r s t f 2 b e s t ω 3 f 3 b e s t f 3 f 3 b e s t f 3 w o r s t where ɷ 1 ɷ 2 and ɷ 3 are important weights of each objective which is usually obtained by analytic hierarchy process ahp method zhang et al 2020 3 generate optimization results after above processing fccmop model have been converted as a single objective model with normal constraints which can be easily coded in the lingo software 2 3 model performance evaluation method some indicators are involved to measure the model performance economic benefit is the total net economic income of farmers in agricultural production which can be estimated through eqs 4a and 4b the benefit per unit water is defined as the ratio of total economic benefit to total irrigation water the water productivity is defined as the ratio of total yield to total irrigation water the utilization rate benefit per unit water and water productivity are the indicators reflecting water use efficiency the benefit per unit water and water productivity are respectively defined as the ratio of total economic benefit to total irrigation water and the ratio of total yield to total irrigation water the relative deviation rd reflect the change of optimized value relative to status quo which is defined as 6 r d v v v 100 where v and v are the optimization and original value respectively additionally to exam the performance of proposed model in dealing with multiple objectives three indexes including synthetic degree sd sustainability index si and approximation degree of ideal objective value ad are involved for evaluating the comprehensive performance of optimization model the computation equations and the parameter meanings of these three indicators can be found in table 1 the framework of this study can be found in fig 2 providing the detailed steps of generating crop structure planting strategies 3 application 3 1 study area the study area is the middle reaches of heihe river basin mrhrb located in gansu province northwestern china 98 00 100 55 e 38 50 40 00 n fig 3 the mrhrb is featured as semi arid climate belonging to bsk in köppen climate classification it lies between yingluo gorge hydrological station and zhengyi gorge hydrological station it is consisted of three administrative regions which can be divided as 17 irrigation districts as table 2 shows as a typical semi arid region mrhrb has high evaporation above 1000 mm water turns into vapor and enters the atmosphere per year and low precipitation below 250 mm per year over the year while it is a crucial agricultural production base of china from earliest times to the present day with the population growth industrial development and scale expansion of agricultural production mrhrb faces the intense contradiction between water supply and demand the increasing water consumption of middle reaches reduces the available water of the lower reaches and seriously endangers its ecological health leading to the lake disappear the groundwater level decrease and the desertification the lower reaches of heihe river basin even became one of the main sources of sandstorm in china agriculture is the pillar industry in the mrhrb and the largest water use sector accounting for over 90 of the total water consumption the practical problem faced by local water managers is to ensure agricultural production and reduce the consumption of water resources simultaneously 3 2 data collection wheat seed corn field corn and vegetables are the main crops of the mrhrb whose planting area occupy over 80 of the total cultivated land thus these crops are selected as research crops in this study this study set 2014 as the typical year to apply proposed approach to mrhrb many data were collected through field surveys official reports relevant literatures and websites first mod16 pet product in 2010 2014 was downloaded from the website of national aeronautics and space administration nasa https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov according to the latitude and longitude of the study area then the china monthly precipitation value 0 5 0 5 grid data set v2 0 of the study area in 2014 and meteorological station data of zhangye linze and gaotai during 2004 2014 were downloaded from china meteorological data service center http data cma cn en according to the field research in mrhrb available surface water and groundwater resources for irrigating these crops are 8 68 9 77 11 73 and 1 05 2 45 2 94 108 m3 respectively water leakage coefficient of canal and field are 0 66 and 0 80 respectively li et al 2019a regional price of fertilizer is 2 42 cny kg the market price of water in gz lz and gt are 0 08 0 04 and 0 05 cny m3 respectively wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 annual food demand of every people is set as 400 kg referring to data from the chinese dietary guidelines 2016 table 3 shows the monthly comprehensive crop coefficients kc market price and dosage of fertilizer use of research crops table 4 provides the population of each id crop yield irrigation quota and planting area 2014 in different ids 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 spatial et0 and precipitation as fig 3 shows there are three meteorological stations in the study area after calculating the monthly et 0 value and extracting the monthly mod16 pet value of these meteorological stations during 2004 2014 linze station only use the meteorological statistics during 2004 2009 because of data missing the corresponding values of two data series at three meteorological stations can be drawn as fig 4 shows then the functional relationship between these two parameters were determined to avoid the negative values of pm et0 the intercepts were set as zero we found that quadratic model has good performance at ganzhou and gaotai meteorological station while linear model performs well at linze meteorological station with the help of these functional equations and mod16 pet data set the spatial et 0 of each administrative region can be generated fig 5 shows the et 0it and monthly average et 0 indicating that the value of et 0 in the area near the upstream is small and that in the area near the downstream is large such findings in line with geographical features of study area where the upper reaches have higher altitude and vegetation coverage while the lower reaches have lower altitude and vegetation coverage finally the actual evapotranspiration et c of each crop in different ids during crop growth period et cijt were generated through eq 2 and the calculation results are displayed in fig 6 as for spatial precipitation data the values within the latitude and longitude 98 30 101 30 e 38 00 40 30 n of the study area were intercepted and 30 values were found within this area then kriging interpolation method was applied to this area and the spatial precipitation data can be generated after using the mask extraction and average value calculation the precipitation of each id during april to september can be obtained the monthly precipitation of each id and total precipitation during crop growth period in 2014 are displayed in the fig 7 it can be found that the precipitation of the ids near the upstream is greater than ids near the downstream 4 2 spatial water footprint accounting after inputting above data into eqs 1a 1d the crop water footprint of each id during whole growth period in 2014 can be estimated and the footprint results are shown in fig 8 not surprisingly due to the semi arid features of study area blue water footprint is the major component of the total water footprint accounting for around 50 90 for each crop in different ids gray water footprint only occupies about 0 05 0 11 among total water footprint for each crop in different ids indicating that the amounts of pollutants produced by fertilization is small as fig 8 shows luocheng id has the highest blue water footprint while its green and gray water footprint are almost the smallest the reasons why that happens are 1 luocheng id is near the downstream with higher evapotranspiration and less precipitation 2 the crop yield in this id is higher than others 3 the fertilizer usage in gaotai county the administrative region that luocheng id belongs to is the smallest among three administrative regions besides because the green water footprint is greatly affected by precipitation ids near upstream with large precipitation have larger green water footprint value for crops there are significantly difference of the water footprints in different ids in fig 8 it is noteworthy that vegetables have lowest blue green gray and total water footprint owing to their highest crop yield among all crops the gray water footprint of field corn is higher than seed corn because the fertilizer usage of field corn is more than seed corn in whole planting process the water footprint information showed in fig 8 provides clear virtual water structure of each crop from different ids in agricultural production demonstrating that integration of the remote sensing information and cropwat model was a meaningful attempt to estimate the spatial distribution of blue and green water footprint at regions with scarce ground meteorological stations the relevant studies in water footprint calculation can hardly guarantee the accuracy via applying point value to the entire area su et al 2014 yue and guo 2021 or conducting spatial interpolation with several points tang et al 2020 the results obtained in this section can support agricultural water managers adjust the crop planting structure to improve water use efficiency thus this information has been input into the fccmop model to further generate the optimization alternatives of crop planting structure 4 3 optimization results analysis three credibility levels of β including 0 55 0 75 and 0 95 are considered in this study after solving the optimization model through the algorithm in 2 3 section the optimization results of crop planting structure can be generated as table 5 shows the optimization results indicate that the change of credibility level would lead to the somewhat difference among the optimal crop planting structures with the credibility level increasing from 0 55 to 0 75 the total crop planting area in the study area are decreasing according to the solution method of credibility constraint programming the higher the credibility the stronger the robustness of the system different credibility levels represent the different estimation of available water resources and higher credibility level means less available water and land resources which will lead to fierce competition among different crops for example in dm id the resources reduction pressure of irrigation water and land is mainly alleviated by reducing corn planting area especially seed corn about 37 of seed corn planting area in dm id is reduced when the credibility level change from 0 55 to 0 95 although the planting benefit of seed corn is higher than wheat and field optimization results indicate that the food security is the first consideration under the extreme shortage of water resources which well meets the basic requirements of regional crop planting structure planning moreover comparing the status quo in table 4 and optimization results of crop planting area it is noteworthy that the planting area of wheat are reduced in most of the ids owing to its large water demand except ay lc lb xb and hyz the increase planting area of wheat in these exceptions is mainly caused by two reasons high yield such as lc lb xb and hyz id and less irrigation water demand ay id we found that regional governments have made some attempts to reduce the planting area of wheat for saving more irrigation water in field investigation at the study area however wheat is an important staple food for chinese people living in northwest china and thus decision makers face difficulty in balancing the food security and water saving when reducing the planting area of wheat the obtained optimization results in this study remind local decision makers that it is not necessary to reduce the wheat planting area in all irrigation areas for saving irrigation water resources and planting wheat in some advantage area can help solve such problem field corn is staple food closely related to food security and the planting area of field corn can be adjusted dynamically according to available water amounts as a major cash crop in the mrhrb seed corn has obviously advantage among all crops the information in table 5 indicates that the planting scale of seed corn can be further expanded when the available water is abundant vegetables is another advantage crop and its planting area can be expanded to improve farmers income when food security is not affected table 6 displays key indicators that are usually concerned by regional decision makers in crop planting structure planning comparing with status quo all indicators have been significantly improved through optimization model especially for three optimization objectives of fccmop total economic benefit value of status quo is 74 46 108 cny which is lower than optimization results under different credibility level the total economic benefit under credibility of 0 55 0 75 and 0 95 are 88 15 82 35 and 75 06 108 cny respectively gini coefficient of optimization results under different credibility 0 10 0 11 and 0 12 are lower than status quo it can be found that regional water use efficiency has been effectively improved through optimization when the credibility level increased the economic benefit in most ids is cut down which has the same change trend with total planting area on the contrary other two indicators of water use efficiency benefit per unit water and water productivity increase with the improvement of credibility level indicating water deficit can improve water use efficiency to some extent besides the comparison of total footprint between status quo and optimization results shows that the optimal crop planting structure can save more water to obtain same yield in agricultural production which contributes to the sustainable development of arid and semi arid regions as mrhrb fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of total water footprint and its components under three credibility level and status quo in each id through which the dynamic change of regional water footprint can be clearly reflected the darker color of the id denotes the higher value of water footprint when water deficit occurs credibility level raising it is found that the total water footprint of large ids such as dm yk lyh and etc are drop but there is an increasing trend in small ids such as yn lq sh and etc indicating that large ids has stronger bearing capacity for water shortage with more space for planting structure adjustment the change of water footprint is affected by crop yield evapotranspiration and precipitation of each id especially for green water footprint its spatial distribution has high similarity with precipitation ids near the upstream have higher green water footprint than others while the blue water footprint has almost the opposite trend moreover it appears that xj and ss have the highest gray water footprint among ids this is mainly because the lowest proportion of vegetables planted in these two ids while the yield of vegetables is much higher than that of other crops through making the comparison between existing condition and optimal results it is also found that spatial distribution has obviously change to clearly display the changes brought by optimization the detailed comparison of water footprint between existing condition 2014 and optimal results under credibility of 0 75 the blue water usage and total planting area in 2014 is near the credibility level of 0 75 table 7 shows the comparison of water footprint between status quo and optimal results β 0 75 it is noteworthy that the total blue and gray water footprint in most ids is drop while green water utilization rates are raising however lb and lc id have the opposite trend with these ids the total planting area of wheat and field corn in these two ids have been expended to guarantee food security of the study area but it comes at the cost of reducing the planting area of vegetables and seed corn with high economic benefits and yield resulting in the water footprint raising that is these two ids have advantage in planting food crops with high water demand and low income and local managers should formulate corresponding policies to increase the planting area of food crops in such areas to save irrigation water resources with the help of this information local decision makers of agricultural production can estimate the allocation efficiency of different crop planting strategies and determining better agricultural land use practice 4 4 performance analysis of fccmop model to identify the performance of fccmop model in dealing with multiple objectives three new optimization model with single objective are built based on fccmop model as table 8 shows these models have the same constraints as fccmop after solving the model 1 2 and 3 the optimal results and corresponding objective values were generated then the values of sd si and ad were calculated based on the computation equations in table 1 and the performance comparisons between single objective models and fccmop model were made with the help of three indicators the comparison results are displayed in fig 10 comparing the indicators of status quo with the optimal results under the credibility level of β 0 75 it is found that all optimization models can effectively improve the value of these three indexes especially compared with single objective models fccmop model shows obvious advantages in most indicators under each credibility level indicating that fccmop can well deal with the conflicting contradictions among configuration objectives of different dimensions it is noteworthy that model 2 shows the better performance in ad index which may be due to the relatively large variation of gini coefficient calculated by different models besides by comparing the optimal results under different credibility level the decreased trend is found in value of sd si and ad with the increase of credibility level this suggests that water deficit will not only damage the coordinated development degree of economy society and environment but also hinder the regional sustainable development ability and the realization of development objectives the performance examines illustrated that the fccmop model could successfully make synergic control of multiple water allocation objectives in optimizing and make full use of remote sensing based spatial water footprint information which were rarely considered in similar studies dai et al 2021 li et al 2019b the indicators using for identifying model performance including sd si and ad can provide support for the evaluation of agricultural land use strategies the real world application indicated that the proposed approach has advantages in 1 fully reflecting the spatial variability of crop water footprint 2 successfully dealing with multiple conflicting objectives and fuzziness in planning crop planting 3 well evaluating the comprehensive performance of the optimization schemes from three aspects besides the mod16 pet data spatial precipitation data and meteorological station data are usually easily accessible from the website which make this approach more easy to apply in practical agricultural water management than others however it is notable that many relevant data such as crop yield and growth period still have to be collected through field survey for calculating water footprint and optimization such data is expected to be collected through some new technologies such as remote sensing in the future for fully reflecting spatiotemporal variability of data besides as a complex system crop planting area structure optimization include multiple uncertainties such as random fuzzy interval and their interactions these uncertainties should be considered in the future optimization model formulation to improve the practicability and effectiveness of the optimal results 5 conclusions this paper developed a novel optimal modeling approach for planning crop planting structure to improve water use efficiency and ensure the harmoniously development of economic social and environmental benefit considering the spatial distribution of water footprint through the optimization the optimal results under scenarios of water deficit β 0 55 status quo β 0 75 and water abundant β 0 95 can be generated which can provide the adjustment directions of regional crop planting planning to respond the dynamic available irrigation water resources the approach used in this study can help policy makers plan crop planting structure in an efficient manner three performance evaluation indicators including synthetic degree sd sustainability index si and approximation degree of ideal objective value ad can give a more comprehensive picture of agricultural land use strategies these will contribute to water scarcity remission and the sustainable development in arid and semi arid regions from the application to the middle reaches of heihe river basin the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the remote sensing data can effectively improve the accuracy of water footprint estimation and identify crop planting advantage distribution in spatial 2 the planting area of crops with high evapotranspiration should be increased in irrigation districts near the upstream where the precipitation is higher than others which can improve economic benefit and utilization rate of green water by 10 59 and 3 96 respectively while reduced gini coefficient by 23 94 3 through optimization the average total blue and gray water footprint among ids are drop by 5 45 5 91 and 4 70 while green water utilization rates is raised by 3 96 comparing with status quo 2014 4 water scarcity will not only damage the coordinated development degree of economy society and environment but also hurt the regional sustainable development ability and the realization of development objectives this approach was portable and practical for finding optimal crop planting structure considering spatial water footprint of crops remote sensing data utilization objective functions and constraints formulation and solution method in this study can serve as a reference for crop planting structure planning in similar regions however some research limitations as mentioned in the results

9938,widespread water losses in endorheic river basins have triggered ecological disasters agricultural irrigation has been one of the major drivers of water losses it is imperative to address the water conflict between agriculture and ecosystems in arid regions but significant gaps remain in knowledge of the water agriculture ecosystem nexus the heihe river basin china s second largest endorheic river basin lost its terminal lake in the 1990 s due to a rapid decline in river discharge to the downstream area but the lake has returned quickly since the early 2000 s a system analysis on the recovery of the lake is performed in this study fusing field observations remote sensing data and ecohydrological model simulations the major findings show that the waning and waxing of the lake are driven remotely by agricultural irrigation in the midstream area rather than the climate a one decade effort involving diversion restrictions in the middle reach starting from 2000 has recovered the lake to the condition of the early 1970 s under historical climate conditions saving extra irrigation water may change the recovery trajectory but would not significantly enhance the stability level the aquifer connected to the lake acts as a buffer receiving leakage from the lake under normal conditions while discharging water to the lake under dry conditions the overall water efficiency of water conservation for lake restoration during 2002 2012 is estimated to be only 3 5 due to significant riverbed leakage in the downstream area nevertheless leakage loss is beneficial to the recovery of groundwater and vegetation downstream whether the diversion restriction needs modification depends on the tradeoff between ecological services provided by the lake and its related ecosystems and economic benefit produced by the midstream agriculture this study provides insight into agricultural water management and ecological conservation in endorheic river basins in a fast changing global environment keywords endorheic lake arid region agricultural irrigation ecological restoration environmental flow groundwater 1 introduction the global endorheic system has experienced widespread water losses in surface water soil moisture and groundwater in response to both climate change and human intervention wang et al 2018a over 70 of the global net permanent water loss has occurred in the middle east and central asia due to drought and water resource exploitation including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal pekel et al 2016 in some areas such as the aral sea basin varis 2014 and the mongolian plateau tao et al 2015 socioeconomic activities such as agricultural irrigation and mining are the leading causes of loss in inland lakes the disappearing lakes in these areas are often accompanied by ecological and environmental disasters such as vegetation degradation and sand storms and socioeconomic problems vörösmarty et al 2000 husar et al 2001 zhang et al 2011 xiao et al 2016 thus preventing inland lakes from further degrading or even vanishing is imperative and critical to achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs raised by the united nations griggs et al 2013 the endorheic river basins in western china including the four largest ones i e the tarim river hui et al 2008 tao et al 2011 heihe river huang and wen 2014 li et al 2018 shiyang river su et al 2014 wei et al 2020 and shule river basins chen et al 2012 ma et al 2019 have experienced water body disappearance and ecological degradation for decades to address this problem china has launched ecological restoration programs for its endorheic basins in the past two decades xu 2011 bryan et al 2018 significant research attention has been given to impacts of ecological restoration programs particularly afforestation on regional hydrologic cycles and water resources ouyang et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 but an opposite research question how water resource management would promote ecological restoration programs has been much less addressed in practice conservation of water resources from agricultural irrigation for ecosystems is a common restoration strategy and positive impacts have been observed tao et al 2008 day et al 2018 li et al 2018 from a broader perspective the agriculture ecosystem water conflict and restoration challenge in western china is very typical in arid inland areas worldwide under a rapidly changing environment to address the water conflict and restoration challenges described above ecohydrological mechanisms associated with basin wide restoration efforts need to be systematically examined from a long term perspective this study uses the heihe river basin hrb the second largest endorheic river basin in china as the testbed to explore the ecohydrological mechanisms by fusing multisource data the hrb is a representative endorheic river basin and restoration has been implemented there for more than a decade li et al 2018 tian et al 2018 in the late 20th century the extensively irrigated croplands in the hexi corridor a vital passageway of the ancient silk road absorbed the river flow in the middle basin causing serious ecological problems in the lower basin particularly the drying up of the terminal lake and east juyan lake and killing of culturally significant populus euphratica trees the disappearance of east juyan lake was a reminder of the regression of the aral sea varis 2014 since 2000 as a key measure of restoration the central government imposed a restriction on surface water diversion for irrigation in the middle hrb which guarantees certain amounts of river flow for the lower hrb under different hydrological conditions wu et al 2014 2015 2016 the system appears to be responsive to the regulation as both the degraded vegetation and the dried end of the lake started to recover zhang et al 2018 the dramatic retreat and expansion of the terminal lake in just a few decades presents a unique case of lake restoration and agricultural water management in arid regions while the hydrological processes in the hrb have been adequately understood in general tian et al 2015 yao et al 2017 li et al 2018 ecohydrological mechanisms associated with the waxing and waning of the terminal lake need further exploration some researchers have quantified the variations in lake area and level based on different terraces of east juyan lake peng and tian 2016 and discussed lake area expansion and vegetation restoration si et al 2005 xiao et al 2005 a recent study zhang et al 2019 investigated the response of the area of east juyan lake to environmental flow regulation between 2005 and 2015 a water mass balance model was built for the lake and the annual discharge to sustain an appropriate lake area level was estimated while the study of zhang et al 2019 verified the significant contribution of flow regulation in the middle hrb to the recovery of the lake area ecohydrological mechanisms of the recovery have not been fully understood and several critical issues deserve further research including the variation in the lake area over a longer time span the role of groundwater and the linkage between the lake area and agricultural development in the middle hrb due to these knowledge gaps it has been long debated whether the flow regulation is too stringent for the middle hrb this study addresses the abovementioned issues by fusing meteorological and hydrological observations simulation results of an integrated hydrological model and remote sensing data to achieve a holistic view of the lake recovery process remote sensing data are widely used to quantify the areas of surface waters over a long time span at different scales e g individual water body regional and global scales yu et al 2010 pekel et al 2016 wang et al 2018b grill et al 2019 and they are therefore used in this study to characterize the long term 1972 2015 variation in lake area the main objectives of the study are 1 to reveal the ecohydrological mechanisms behind the recovery of east juyan lake after a decade of conservation effort and address the importance of groundwater in the recovery process 2 to evaluate the water conservation and flow delivery efficiencies of environmental flow regulation and 3 to resolve the long lasting debate over the appropriateness of flow regulation from a system perspective as the water and ecological issues in the hrb mirror a common challenge faced by many endorheic river basins around the world the results of this study provide insights into water resource management and ecological conservation in such basins 2 data and methods 2 1 study area east juyan lake is the terminal lake of the hrb the second largest endorheic river basin in china fig 1a the qilian mountains are in the upstream region of the hrb and the middle hexi corridor and the northern alxa plateau are in the middle and lower regions respectively fig 1b the middle and lower regions have a continental arid temperate climate and the annual average temperature is approximately 9 0 where the highest temperature is 41 in july and the lowest temperature is 36 4 in january in the downstream area liao et al 2015 annual precipitation ranges from 69 to 216 mm in the middle hrb while in the lower hrb it is only 35 mm in the middle and lower hrb the annual potential evapotranspiration reaches 2300 mm zhang et al 2018 the middle hrb has a century old history of agriculture in its oases which consumes a large amount of water the irrigation system is relatively complete with more than 893 main canals and branch canals the lower hrb is mainly composed of the gobi desert with sparse and vulnerable vegetation the ejina basin in the lower hrb fig 1c is considered to be a major eco barrier in northern china xin et al 2001 the water sources of the heihe river are mainly rainfall and snowmelt from the qilian mountains where the annual precipitation is approximately 532 mm yue et al 2016 the dividing point between the upper and middle reaches is yingluoxia ylx and the dividing point between the middle and lower reaches is zhangyixia zyx fig 1b the main river bifurcates into the east river and the west river at langxinshan lxs ending at east juyan lake and west juyan lake respectively west juyan lake has been dry for a half century and the current conservation efforts are focused on east juyan lake four gauging stations are built along the east river at ylx zyx lxs and angiche ang providing long term discharge data ang is very close to east juyan lake fig 1b and discharge at ang is considered to be the river inflow into the lake the annual average runoff at the four stations is approximately 18 11 108 m3 10 80 108 m3 5 79 108 m3 and 0 57 108 m3 between 2002 and 2012 respectively the water conflict between the irrigation needs in the middle hrb and the ecological needs in the lower hrb has existed for decades the annual runoff at lxs was approximately 10 0 108 m3 in the 1960 s but it started to decrease drastically in the 1970 s due to the fast growing irrigation in the middle hrb in the 1990 s the annual runoff at lxs was only 3 0 108 m3 on average and even as low as 1 8 108 m3 in 1992 since 2000 to restore east juyan lake and vegetation in the lower hrb the central government has strictly regulated surface water diversion for irrigation in the middle hrb as a result the annual runoff at lxs has been maintained at a level of approximately 5 0 108 m3 and the terminal lake has been gradually recovering 2 2 study framework and data sources the study framework is illustrated in fig 2 which consists of four major steps interpretation of the lake area see section 2 3 derivation of lake storage change see section 2 4 calculation of lake water balance see section 2 4 and evaluation of water efficiency see section 2 5 with the water efficiency evaluated the role of the environmental flow regulation in mediating the water conflict between agriculture and ecosystems in the hrb was addressed more details of the major steps are provided in the following subsections the integrated ecohydrological model used in this study heiflow hydrological ecological integrated watershed scale flow model zheng et al 2020 was developed and successfully calibrated and validated for the study area in our previous studies details of the model development and application in the hrb can be found in the references the major novelty of this study is not using the existing heiflow model but fusing it with remote sensing data and field observations fig 2 to address the ecohydrological mechanisms and water efficiency of the lake restoration process the multisource data used in this study mainly include the following 1 landsat images with a 30 m spatial resolution were downloaded from the united stated geological survey usgs remote sensing image database http earthexplore usgs gov a total of 1591 remote sensing images see table 1 were screened or are free of clouds to interpret the surface area of east juyan lake during 1972 2015 table 1 for landsat satellites their repeat cycles are 16 or 18 days there is no imagery available during 1979 1985 2 two sources of data are used to establish the stage area relationship of the terminal lake from may 2014 to october 2014 the hourly water level of east juyan lake was automatically recorded at an hourly time step by a conductivity temperature depth ctd micro diver designed by schlumberger installed in the lake as the landsat images are taken at noon the average water level between 11 00 am and 2 00 pm is paired with the interpreted lake area in addition the stage area curve reported in feng et al 2015 is referred to 3 daily meteorological data from 2002 to 2012 including temperature wind speed and relative humidity were collected from the china meteorological website http data cma cn en 4 the annual discharge data at ylx zyx and ang during 2002 2012 were acquired from the environmental ecological science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn en and from feng et al 2015 2 3 interpretation of lake area based on satellite imagery in this study the modified normalized difference water index mndwi mcfeeters 1996 is adopted to derive the surface area of east juyan lake 1 mndwi green mir green mir b and 2 band 5 b and 2 band 5 where green and mir stand for the green band and the middle infrared band respectively for the landsat imagery bands 2 and 5 are the green band and the middle infrared band respectively the mndwi has been widely used in extracting water bodies zhu et al 2014 yan et al 2016 and its applicability for lakes and wetlands in arid and semiarid areas has been well demonstrated tao et al 2015 the derivation of the lake area follows a well established procedure singh et al 2015 szabó et al 2016 the steps are briefly introduced below an image is pretreated with atmospheric corrections and radiation calibrations before it is used to calculate the mndwi by eq 1 next the image is manually cropped to a region surrounding the lake to reduce the data size and the computational burden the third step is to calculate the mndwi pixel by pixel to determine the water surface area the calculation of the mndwi is performed with the raster calculator in arcgis 10 4 esri inc if a pixel has an mndwi higher than a predefined threshold value it is identified as a lake surface pixel in this study the threshold was set as 0 based on preliminary tests 2 4 calculation of the lake water balance a stage area curve fig 3 was constructed by fitting the data points to a third order polynomial function using the least squares method the derived function and the value of r2 are illustrated in the figure the same function form has been used to derive the stage area curves of several lakes in the alxa plateau region which is where east juyan lake is located zheng et al 2016 the data points in fig 3 are mainly collected from feng et al 2015 and the two additional data points obtained in 2014 extended the high end of the water level range the lake geometry is approximated by a frustum pyramid following sima and tajrishy 2013 the change in storage δv km3 in a given period can be calculated as 2 δ v 0 33 l 2 l 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the beginning and ending of the time period respectively l 1 and l 2 are the water levels m and a 1 and a 2 are the lake areas km2 lake evaporation is largely determined by lake area temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure and saturation vapor pressure lenters et al 2005 in this study the method used by li 2000 which has been tested in the alxa plateau region is adopted to calculate evaporation as follows 3 e t e a a t where e t is the lake evaporation at time t 108 m3 e a is the evaporation per unit lake area 108 m3 km2 and a t is the lake area km2 at time t e a is further estimated by eq 4 4 e a 0 1 0 24 1 rh 2 e 0 e 1 u 0 85 u u 2 where rh stands for relative humidity u is wind speed m s e 0 is saturation vapor pressure at the lake surface hpa and e 1 is the atmospheric vapor pressure 150 cm above the surface of the water hpa according to the magnus equation murray 1966 e 0 at the water surface specifically denoted as e0water can be determined by eq 5 5 e 0 water 6 11 107 45 t 235 t where t is the air temperature at the surface c for the ice surface eq 6 can be used to calculate e 0 specifically denoted as e0ice 6 e 0 ice 6 11 109 5 t 265 t the annual water balance of east juyan lake can be formulated as 7 i e g v where i is the inflow from the river to the lake e is the lake evaporation as previously defined g is the groundwater recharge from the lake positive value or discharge into the lake negative value and δv is the change in the water storage of the lake precipitation is neglected when the annual precipitation in this area is less than 40 mm wang et al 2014 liao et al 2015 which accounts for no more than 3 of i in eq 7 it is therefore a reasonable assumption that neglecting the precipitation over the lake would have no significant impact on the water balance calculation because the lake is located in a very remote area with poor transportation access no field data are available to quantify the groundwater exchange which represents a common situation for many endorheic lakes in this study to estimate the groundwater exchange eq 7 is rewritten as 8 g i e v on the right side of eq 8 i can be derived based on flow observations and v can be estimated based on geometric calculation eq 2 as the flow records have been well maintained at ang fig 1b and the stage area curve shows excellent goodness of fit fig 3 both i and v involve small estimation error therefore it is assumed that the uncertainty in g mainly comes from the calculation of e to further investigate this uncertainty issue two previous studies on e are referred wang wang et al 2014 used the penman monteith fao56 approach to obtain an annual evaporation estimate of 1410 mm and liu et al 2016 used ф20 pan evaporation at the ejina weather station and achieved an estimate of 1471 mm based on eqs 3 and 4 this study reached an estimate of 1429 mm a value between the previous two estimates with a discrepancy of less than 3 therefore it is assumed that eqs 3 and 4 adequately quantify e at an annual time scale 2 5 water efficiency indices to evaluate the impact of environmental flow regulation mainly by reducing surface water diversion for irrigation in the middle hrb for the recovery of the terminal lake this study develops two indices the water conservation efficiency ef c in the midstream and the water delivery efficiency ef d in the downstream 9 ef c δ r δ d 10 ef d δ i δ r where δd is the total reduction in surface water diversion for irrigation in the middle hrb δr is the total increase in runoff at zyx due to δd and δi is the corresponding change in the inflow to the lake r d and i are water volumes in a certain period of time the two indices can be evaluated for a given time period e g one year or multiple years a higher value of ef c indicates that a larger portion of the reduction in diversion can be converted to the increase in the environmental flow i e runoff at zyx and a higher value of ef d indicates that a larger portion of the conserved environmental flow can eventually contribute to the lake recovery thus the overall water efficiency of the environmental flow regulation by reducing the surface water diversion can be expressed as 11 ef o i d r d i r ef c ef d a higher value of ef o indicates a higher overall efficiency in the given period 3 results and discussion 3 1 lake area in the past four decades in fig 4 a the interpreted lake area during 1972 2015 and the corresponding daily runoff at zyx are shown the data gap from 1978 to 1985 is due to the lack of corresponding landsat images this data gap does not impact the water balance calculation and efficiency analysis in this study which are based on the period after 2000 the variation in the lake area coincides well with that in the runoff at zyx and a deceasing trend is observed before 2000 seasonal drying started in the late 1970s and became increasingly severe in the 1980s and 1990s after the environmental flow regulation was enforced by the central government in 2000 the seasonal drying up became less severe and eventually stopped after 2004 and the lake area returned gradually the lake area became stable after around 2007 and fluctuated between 40 km2 and 60 km2 fig 4 b consists of four landsat images of the lake area in october the lake area normally reaches a maximum in october in 1995 2000 2005 and 2010 which clearly demonstrates the drying up phenomenon in the 1990s and the rapid recovery in the early period of this century as the later three images show as fig 4 c shows the runoff at ylx i e the outlet of the mountainous upper hrb exhibits no significant tendency since 1972 but the gap between the runoff at ylx and zyx continued to increase before 2000 the dashed line because the runoff at zyx is primarily caused by the runoff at ylx rather than by local precipitation the increasing gap before 2000 indicates the enhanced surface water diversion for irrigation in the middle hrb during this period after 2000 the gap dropped and then became stable reflecting the effect of flow regulation thus the waxing and waning of the terminal lake in the gobi desert have been remotely linked to human activities in the midstream oases and the environmental flow regulation turns out to be an effective control over the tradeoff between the conservation of the terminal lake and the agricultural development in the middle hrb the impact of regulation is further investigated in section 3 3 3 2 role of groundwater in lake recovery the changes in the annual water balance of the lake during 2002 2012 are shown in fig 5 a while in fig 5 b the respective changes in the annual average lake area along with the estimates of annual lake evaporation from different sources are shown as fig 5 a shows groundwater exchange comprises a significant portion of the water budget in most years and it shifts between recharge to the aquifer g 0 and discharge to the lake g 0 groundwater discharge usually occurs when the river flow input has a notable drop in contrast to the previous year such as in 2005 2007 2008 and 2010 interestingly the shift from recharge to discharge leads to an increase in lake storage and maintains the increasing tendency of the lake area this indicates that the aquifer connected to the lake acts as a buffer during the restoration period the groundwater system continued to recover due to enhanced leakage along the downstream section of the river in the years when the river flow into the terminal lake dropped the aquifer lake gradient changed its direction and the aquifer released the water stored in the previous year to the lake however this buffering effect was not present in 2003 probably because the groundwater was not sufficiently recovered at the early stage of the restoration an important implication is that the leakage loss along the river can contribute to the lake recovery due to the buffering effect although with a certain time delay the role of groundwater will be further discussed below the lake recovery progress can be further divided into two stages see fig 5b the annual average lake area increased rapidly in 2002 2007 stage 1 and became stable afterwards stage 2 fluctuating between 45 km2 and 50 km2 the reason is two fold first as shown in fig 3 there is an inflection point in the lake area at approximately 25 km2 and beyond this point the lake area becomes much less sensitive to water level increases second evaporation increases with the lake area and after 2007 the streamflow input was less than the evaporation in most years in which case the variation in lake storage was largely impacted by the groundwater flux this further demonstrates the important role of groundwater in lake restoration in addition the dashed lines in fig 5 b indicate that the uncertainty in the estimation of lake evaporation would not significantly impact our water balance calculation in fig 6 a the annual storage change v is plotted against the annual groundwater exchange g for the two stages separately the linear relations between the two variables in the two stages are both strong but distinct in the second stage v is more responsive to g fig 6 b demonstrates a linear relationship between i e and g and the regression function r2 0 869 and p 0 001 for the t test is as follows 12 g 1 4109 i e 0 0747 a regression function can also be built between the lake evaporation estimated by eqs 3 and 4 and the annual average lake area as 13 e t 0 0144 a t 0 054 the regression equation has a high r2 value of 0 9736 p 0 001 for the t test based on the data from 2002 to 2012 eq 13 approximates eqs 3 and 4 in which the annual average lake area is the only dependent variable eqs 12 and 13 provide an efficient way to estimate g with the river inflow monitored and the future lake area estimated 3 3 water efficiency of the flow regulation as mentioned before the main restoration strategy is to reduce the irrigation water from surface water diversion in the middle hrb and secure certain amounts of environmental flow at zyx under varying hydrological conditions using the heiflow model zheng et al 2020 the water conservation efficiency ef c was evaluated see fig 2 under four hypothetical scenarios of diversion reduction in the core area of the middle hrb see fig 1a with the reduction rate using the historical level in 2002 2012 as the reference ranging from 5 to 20 see table 2 in each of the hypothetical scenarios the groundwater pumping is assumed to be unchanged such that the reduction in diversion is equivalent to the reduction in total irrigation water in the core area as shown in table 2 the calculated values of ef c in the four scenarios range from 0 70 to 0 76 which implies that 24 30 of the river runoff saved from the irrigation would turn into stored water mainly aquifers in this case in the middle hrb and or evapotranspiration in non farmland areas e g river surface and riparian zone to further analyze the ef c value for the historical period of 2002 2012 the linear relationship between ef c and the amount of irrigation reduction was first constructed fig 7a based on the four scenarios in table 2 the value of ef c corresponding to the historical irrigation condition i e δd 0 was then extrapolated to be 0 690 this means that under historical conditions reducing surface water diversion by one unit in the core area of the middle hrb can lead to an increase of 0 690 units in the environmental flow towards the lower hrb in fig 7 b the linear relationship between the cumulative runoff at zyx r and the cumulative river inflow to the lake i considering 2002 as the starting point is illustrated each data point in fig 7 b represents one of the 11 years the slope of the fitted line is equal to 0 0501 which is also the constant water delivery efficiency of the downstream ef d in 2002 2012 in other words on average only 5 of the environmental flow through zyx eventually reaches the lake however the significant water loss during the river delivery i e r i mostly recharges the groundwater which can support the riparian vegetation i e transpiration and release water to the lake i e a negative g in certain circumstances and is therefore of great value for ecological services according to eq 11 the overall water efficiency of the flow regulation for lake restoration ef o during 2002 2012 is calculated to be 0 035 0 690 0 0501 which means on average only 3 5 of the reduced water diversion in the middle hrb would be converted to the increase in the flow into the terminal lake apparently ef o is largely limited by ef d because riverbed leakage is significant in the lower hrb note that 3 5 only quantifies the direct impact of the river flow on the lake area because the riverbed leakage along the river replenishes the local aquifer a portion of it may eventually contribute to the lake recovery through the buffering effect of groundwater as discussed in section 3 2 in addition riverbed loss can be beneficial to the recovery of vegetation in the lower hrb 3 4 revisiting the flow regulation the current regulation requires bottom line outflows at zyx under different inflow conditions at ylx based on a predefined flow regulation curve wu et al 2016 however the regulation does not account for the hydrological mechanisms of lake recovery as discussed in the previous section whether the regulation is an appropriate design for lake recovery has been long debated but has received few quantitative analyses the water managers in the lower hrb claim that in most years the actual flow volume at zyx did not reach the required amount while the water managers in the middle hrb complain that the regulation curve is too strict and not fair for them our system analysis of lake recovery provides a unique perspective for investigating this issue as fig 8 shows the lake area a increases rapidly with the cumulative runoff at zyx r at the early stage of the restoration and then becomes stable even as r continues to increase several important implications of this curve include the following first the one decade effort of flow regulation has recovered the lake to a stable status approximately 45 km2 on average in this sense although the target of diversion control in the middle hrb has not been fully fulfilled the regulation is still a success second the stable status is largely determined by the hydrogeological characteristics of the basin lake morphology and the historical climate conditions during which water sources and sinks for the lake roughly cancel out under historical climate conditions saving extra irrigation water in the middle hrb every year may change the recovery trajectory i e the stable status may be reached earlier but would not significantly enhance the stability level a larger lake area would only be realized if a much wetter climate or a dramatic reduction in irrigation water occurred in the hrb both of which are unlikely to happen in the near future third whether the current flow regulation is appropriate depends on how large the desired lake area is if a smaller stable lake area e g 40 km2 is acceptable the middle hrb could use more river flow for irrigation such that the flow turns to et in croplands rather than evaporates in the lake essentially this represents a tradeoff between the value of ecological services and economic benefits from a broader perspective a large lake area does not necessarily mean a better ecological outcome as discussed in section 3 3 riverbed loss would be beneficial to the recovery of vegetation in the lower hrb in addition ecosystems e g groundwater sustained wetlands in the middle hrb also face water stress xiao et al 2015 while the flow regulation has limited surface water diversion in the middle hrb and secured more water for the downstream area and the lake it also stimulated groundwater pumping and caused a decline in groundwater storage in the middle hrb wu et al 2016 a comprehensive assessment of ecological services and socioeconomic analyses is necessary to set an appropriate target for lake area recovery which deserves a separate study 4 conclusions this study performs a system analysis on the recovery of east juyan lake the terminal lake of china s second largest endorheic river basin after a decade of conservation effort by fusing meteorological and hydrological observations remote sensing data and the simulation results of an integrated ecohydrological model previous knowledge gaps in the ecohydrological mechanisms and water efficiencies of the restoration process and in the appropriateness of flow regulation are rectified the major findings include the following first the waning and waxing of the terminal lake in the gobi desert during the past two decades are largely driven by human activities in the midstream oases rather than by climate conditions after 2007 the lake area reached a stable status which was largely determined by the hydrological characteristics of the basin and lake and by the historical climate conditions second surface water groundwater interaction plays a critical role in the recovery of the lake the aquifer connected to the lake acts as a buffer receiving leakage from the lake under normal conditions but discharging water to the lake when the river flow input has a notable drop in contrast to the previous year after the lake area reached a stable status the mild interannual variation in lake storage is largely impacted by the groundwater flux third the water conservation efficiency of the midstream ef c and the water delivery efficiency of the downstream ef d under historical conditions are estimated to be 0 690 and 0 050 respectively therefore the overall water efficiency of the flow regulation for lake restoration ef o during 2002 2012 is calculated to be 0 035 this low value of ef o is mainly due to the significant leakage loss along the lower reach of the heihe river however leakage loss may contribute to the buffering effect of groundwater and the recovery of vegetation in the lower hrb overall this study represents an in depth analysis of restoring wetlands impacted by large scale human activities a common challenge faced by endorheic river basins around the world the hydrological mechanisms revealed in this study improve our understanding of the evolution of inland waters in a fast changing global environment the results of this study provide significant policy and management implications for water resource managers in the hrb and other endorheic river basins the present study is focused more on hydrology than on ecology and the interplay between the hydrologic regime and ecosystems e g the relationship between lake water storage and the health of various ecosystems in and around the lake deserves further exploration future studies also need to address the challenge in setting an appropriate target of restoration e g how large the maintained waterbody should be through a comprehensive assessment of ecological services and socioeconomic impacts in addition comparative studies across a variety of endorheic river basins would be of great value

9938,widespread water losses in endorheic river basins have triggered ecological disasters agricultural irrigation has been one of the major drivers of water losses it is imperative to address the water conflict between agriculture and ecosystems in arid regions but significant gaps remain in knowledge of the water agriculture ecosystem nexus the heihe river basin china s second largest endorheic river basin lost its terminal lake in the 1990 s due to a rapid decline in river discharge to the downstream area but the lake has returned quickly since the early 2000 s a system analysis on the recovery of the lake is performed in this study fusing field observations remote sensing data and ecohydrological model simulations the major findings show that the waning and waxing of the lake are driven remotely by agricultural irrigation in the midstream area rather than the climate a one decade effort involving diversion restrictions in the middle reach starting from 2000 has recovered the lake to the condition of the early 1970 s under historical climate conditions saving extra irrigation water may change the recovery trajectory but would not significantly enhance the stability level the aquifer connected to the lake acts as a buffer receiving leakage from the lake under normal conditions while discharging water to the lake under dry conditions the overall water efficiency of water conservation for lake restoration during 2002 2012 is estimated to be only 3 5 due to significant riverbed leakage in the downstream area nevertheless leakage loss is beneficial to the recovery of groundwater and vegetation downstream whether the diversion restriction needs modification depends on the tradeoff between ecological services provided by the lake and its related ecosystems and economic benefit produced by the midstream agriculture this study provides insight into agricultural water management and ecological conservation in endorheic river basins in a fast changing global environment keywords endorheic lake arid region agricultural irrigation ecological restoration environmental flow groundwater 1 introduction the global endorheic system has experienced

lakes in these areas are often accompanied by ecological and environmental disasters such as vegetation degradation and sand storms and socioeconomic problems vörösmarty et al 2000 husar et al 2001 zhang et al 2011 xiao et al 2016 thus preventing inland lakes from further degrading or even vanishing is imperative and critical to achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs raised by the united nations griggs et al 2013 the endorheic river basins in western china including the four largest ones i e the tarim river hui et al 2008 tao et al 2011 heihe river huang and wen 2014 li et al 2018 shiyang river su et al 2014 wei et al 2020 and shule river basins chen et al 2012 ma et al 2019 have experienced water body disappearance and ecological degradation for decades to address this problem china has launched ecological restoration programs for its endorheic basins in the past two decades xu 2011 bryan et al 2018 significant research attention has been given to impacts of ecological restoration programs particularly afforestation on regional hydrologic cycles and water resources ouyang et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 but an opposite research question how water resource management would promote ecological restoration programs has been much less addressed in practice conservation of water resources from agricultural irrigation for ecosystems is a common restoration strategy and positive impacts have been observed tao et al 2008 day et al 2018 li et al 2018 from a broader perspective the agriculture ecosystem water conflict and restoration challenge in western china is very typical in arid inland areas worldwide under a rapidly changing environment to address the water conflict and restoration challenges described above ecohydrological mechanisms associated with basin wide restoration efforts need to be systematically examined from a long term perspective this study uses the heihe river basin hrb the second largest endorheic river basin in china as the testbed to explore the ecohydrological mechanisms by fusing multisource data the hrb is a representative endorheic river basin and restoration has been implemented there for more than a decade li et al 2018 tian et al 2018 in the late 20th century the extensively irrigated croplands in the hexi corridor a vital passageway of the ancient silk road absorbed the river flow in the middle basin causing serious ecological problems in the lower basin particularly the drying up of the terminal lake and east juyan lake and killing of culturally significant populus euphratica trees the disappearance of east juyan lake was a reminder of the regression of the aral sea varis 2014 since 2000 as a key measure of restoration the central government imposed a restriction on surface water diversion for irrigation in the middle hrb which guarantees certain amounts of river flow for the lower hrb under different hydrological conditions wu et al 2014 2015 2016 the system appears to be responsive to the regulation as both the degraded vegetation and the dried end of the lake started to recover zhang et al 2018 the dramatic retreat and expansion of the terminal lake in just a few decades presents a unique case of lake restoration and agricultural water management in arid regions while the hydrological processes in the hrb have been adequately understood in general tian et al 2015 yao et al 2017 li et al 2018 ecohydrological mechanisms associated with the waxing and waning of the terminal lake need further exploration some researchers have quantified the variations in lake area and level based on different terraces of east juyan lake peng and tian 2016 and discussed lake area expansion and vegetation restoration si et al 2005 xiao et al 2005 a recent study zhang et al 2019 investigated the response of the area of east juyan lake to environmental flow regulation between 2005 and 2015 a water mass balance model was built for the lake and the annual discharge to sustain an appropriate lake area level was estimated while the study of zhang et al 2019 verified the significant contribution of flow regulation in the middle hrb to the recovery of the lake area ecohydrological mechanisms of the recovery have not been fully understood and several critical issues deserve further research including the variation in the lake area over a longer time span the role of groundwater and the linkage between the lake area and agricultural development in the middle hrb due to these knowledge gaps it has been long debated whether the flow regulation is too stringent for the middle hrb this study addresses the abovementioned issues by fusing meteorological and hydrological observations simulation results of an integrated hydrological model and remote sensing data to achieve a holistic view of the lake recovery process remote sensing data are widely used to quantify the areas of surface waters over a long time span at different scales e g individual water body regional and global scales yu et al 2010 pekel et al 2016 wang et al 2018b grill et al 2019 and they are therefore used in this study to characterize the long term 1972 2015 variation in lake area the main objectives of the study are 1 to reveal the ecohydrological mechanisms behind the recovery of east juyan lake after a decade of conservation effort and address the importance of groundwater in the recovery process 2 to evaluate the water conservation and flow delivery efficiencies of environmental flow regulation and 3 to resolve the long lasting debate over the appropriateness of flow regulation from a system perspective as the water and ecological issues in the hrb mirror a common challenge faced by many endorheic river basins around the world the results of this study provide insights into water resource management and ecological conservation in such basins 2 data and methods 2 1 study area east juyan lake is the terminal lake of the hrb the second largest endorheic river basin in china fig 1a the qilian mountains are in the upstream region of the hrb and the middle hexi corridor and the northern alxa plateau are in the middle and lower regions respectively fig 1b the middle and lower regions have a continental arid temperate climate and the annual average temperature is approximately 9 0 where the highest temperature is 41 in july and the lowest temperature is 36 4 in january in the downstream area liao et al 2015 annual precipitation ranges from 69 to 216 mm in the middle hrb while in the lower hrb it is only 35 mm in the middle and lower hrb the annual potential evapotranspiration reaches 2300 mm zhang et al 2018 the middle hrb has a century old history of agriculture in its oases which consumes a large amount of water the irrigation system is relatively complete with more than 893 main canals and branch canals the lower hrb is mainly composed of the gobi desert with sparse and vulnerable vegetation the ejina basin in the lower hrb fig 1c is considered to be a major eco barrier in northern china xin et al 2001 the water sources of the heihe river are mainly rainfall and snowmelt from the qilian mountains where the annual precipitation is approximately 532 mm yue et al 2016 the dividing point between the upper and middle reaches is yingluoxia ylx and the dividing point between the middle and lower reaches is zhangyixia zyx fig 1b the main river bifurcates into the east river and the west river at langxinshan lxs ending at east juyan lake and west juyan lake respectively west juyan lake has been dry for a half century and the current conservation efforts are focused on east juyan lake four gauging stations are built along the east river at ylx zyx lxs and angiche ang providing long term discharge data ang is very close to east juyan lake fig 1b and discharge at ang is considered to be the river inflow into the lake the annual average runoff at the four stations is approximately 18 11 108 m3 10 80 108 m3 5 79 108 m3 and 0 57 108 m3 between 2002 and 2012 respectively the water conflict between the irrigation needs in the middle hrb and the ecological needs in the lower hrb has existed for decades the annual runoff at lxs was approximately 10 0 108 m3 in the 1960 s but it started to decrease drastically in the 1970 s due to the fast growing irrigation in the middle hrb in the 1990 s the annual runoff at lxs was only 3 0 108 m3 on average and even as low as 1 8 108 m3 in 1992 since 2000 to restore east juyan lake and vegetation in the lower hrb the central government has strictly regulated surface water diversion for irrigation in the middle hrb as a result the annual runoff at lxs has been maintained at a level of approximately 5 0 108 m3 and the terminal lake has been gradually recovering 2 2 study framework and data sources the study framework is illustrated in fig 2 which consists of four major steps interpretation of the lake area see section 2 3 derivation of lake storage change see section 2 4 calculation of lake water balance see section 2 4 and evaluation of water efficiency see section 2 5 with the water efficiency evaluated the role of the environmental flow regulation in mediating the water conflict between agriculture and ecosystems in the hrb was addressed more details of the major steps are provided in the following subsections the integrated ecohydrological model used in this study heiflow hydrological ecological integrated watershed scale flow model zheng et al 2020 was developed and successfully calibrated and validated for the study area in our previous studies details of the model development and application in the hrb can be found in the references the major novelty of this study is not using the existing heiflow model but fusing it with remote sensing data and field observations fig 2 to address the ecohydrological mechanisms and water efficiency of the lake restoration process the multisource data used in this study mainly include the following 1 landsat images with a 30 m spatial resolution were downloaded from the united stated geological survey usgs remote sensing image database http earthexplore usgs gov a total of 1591 remote sensing images see table 1 were screened or are free of clouds to interpret the surface area of east juyan lake during 1972 2015 table 1 for landsat satellites their repeat cycles are 16 or 18 days there is no imagery available during 1979 1985 2 two sources of data are used to establish the stage area relationship of the terminal lake from may 2014 to october 2014 the hourly water level of east juyan lake was automatically recorded at an hourly time step by a conductivity temperature depth ctd micro diver designed by schlumberger installed in the lake as the landsat images are taken at noon the average water level between 11 00 am and 2 00 pm is paired with the interpreted lake area in addition the stage area curve reported in feng et al 2015 is referred to 3 daily meteorological data from 2002 to 2012 including temperature wind speed and relative humidity were collected from the china meteorological website http data cma cn en 4 the annual discharge data at ylx zyx and ang during 2002 2012 were acquired from the environmental ecological science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn en and from feng et al 2015 2 3 interpretation of lake area based on satellite imagery in this study the modified normalized difference water index mndwi mcfeeters 1996 is adopted to derive the surface area of east juyan lake 1 mndwi green mir green mir b and 2 band 5 b and 2 band 5 where green and mir stand for the green band and the middle infrared band respectively for the landsat imagery bands 2 and 5 are the green band and the middle infrared band respectively the mndwi has been widely used in extracting water bodies zhu et al 2014 yan et al 2016 and its applicability for lakes and wetlands in arid and semiarid areas has been well demonstrated tao et al 2015 the derivation of the lake area follows a well established procedure singh et al 2015 szabó et al 2016 the steps are briefly introduced below an image is pretreated with atmospheric corrections and radiation calibrations before it is used to calculate the mndwi by eq 1 next the image is manually cropped to a region surrounding the lake to reduce the data size and the computational burden the third step is to calculate the mndwi pixel by pixel to determine the water surface area the calculation of the mndwi is performed with the raster calculator in arcgis 10 4 esri inc if a pixel has an mndwi higher than a predefined threshold value it is identified as a lake surface pixel in this study the threshold was set as 0 based on preliminary tests 2 4 calculation of the lake water balance a stage area curve fig 3 was constructed by fitting the data points to a third order polynomial function using the least squares method the derived function and the value of r2 are illustrated in the figure the same function form has been used to derive the stage area curves of several lakes in the alxa plateau region which is where east juyan lake is located zheng et al 2016 the data points in fig 3 are mainly collected from feng et al 2015 and the two additional data points obtained in 2014 extended the high end of the water level range the lake geometry is approximated by a frustum pyramid following sima and tajrishy 2013 the change in storage δv km3 in a given period can be calculated as 2 δ v 0 33 l 2 l 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the beginning and ending of the time period respectively l 1 and l 2 are the water levels m and a 1 and a 2 are the lake areas km2 lake evaporation is largely determined by lake area temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure and saturation vapor pressure lenters et al 2005 in this study the method used by li 2000 which has been tested in the alxa plateau region is adopted to calculate evaporation as follows 3 e t e a a t where e t is the lake evaporation at time t 108 m3 e a is the evaporation per unit lake area 108 m3 km2 and a t is the lake area km2 at time t e a is further estimated by eq 4 4 e a 0 1 0 24 1 rh 2 e 0 e 1 u 0 85 u u 2 where rh stands for relative humidity u is wind speed m s e 0 is saturation vapor pressure at the lake surface hpa and e 1 is the atmospheric vapor pressure 150 cm above the surface of the water hpa according to the magnus equation murray 1966 e 0 at the water surface specifically denoted as e0water can be determined by eq 5 5 e 0 water 6 11 107 45 t 235 t where t is the air temperature at the surface c for the ice surface eq 6 can be used to calculate e 0 specifically denoted as e0ice 6 e 0 ice 6 11 109 5 t 265 t the annual water balance of east juyan lake can be formulated as 7 i e g v where i is the inflow from the river to the lake e is the lake evaporation as previously defined g is the groundwater recharge from the lake positive value or discharge into the lake negative value and δv is the change in the water storage of the lake precipitation is neglected when the annual precipitation in this area is less than 40 mm wang et al 2014 liao et al 2015 which accounts for no more than 3 of i in eq 7 it is therefore a reasonable assumption that neglecting the precipitation over the lake would have no significant impact on the water balance calculation because the lake is located in a very remote area with poor transportation access no field data are available to quantify the groundwater exchange which represents a common situation for many endorheic lakes in this study to estimate the groundwater exchange eq 7 is rewritten as 8 g i e v on the right side of eq 8 i can be derived based on flow observations and v can be estimated based on geometric calculation eq 2 as the flow records have been well maintained at ang fig 1b and the stage area curve shows excellent goodness of fit fig 3 both i and v involve small estimation error therefore it is assumed that the uncertainty in g mainly comes from the calculation of e to further investigate this uncertainty issue two previous studies on e are referred wang wang et al 2014 used the penman monteith fao56 approach to obtain an annual evaporation estimate of 1410 mm and liu et al 2016 used ф20 pan evaporation at the ejina weather station and achieved an estimate of 1471 mm based on eqs 3 and 4 this study reached an estimate of 1429 mm a value between the previous two estimates with a discrepancy of less than 3 therefore it is assumed that eqs 3 and 4 adequately quantify e at an annual time scale 2 5 water efficiency indices to evaluate the impact of environmental flow regulation mainly by reducing surface water diversion for irrigation in the middle hrb for the recovery of the terminal lake this study develops two indices the water conservation efficiency ef c in the midstream and the water delivery efficiency ef d in the downstream 9 ef c δ r δ d 10 ef d δ i δ r where δd is the total reduction in surface water diversion for irrigation in the middle hrb δr is the total increase in runoff at zyx due to δd and δi is the corresponding change in the inflow to the lake r d and i are water volumes in a certain period of time the two indices can be evaluated for a given time period e g one year or multiple years a higher value of ef c indicates that a larger portion of the reduction in diversion can be converted to the increase in the environmental flow i e runoff at zyx and a higher value of ef d indicates that a larger portion of the conserved environmental flow can eventually contribute to the lake recovery thus the overall water efficiency of the environmental flow regulation by reducing the surface water diversion can be expressed as 11 ef o i d r d i r ef c ef d a higher value of ef o indicates a higher overall efficiency in the given period 3 results and discussion 3 1 lake area in the past four decades in fig 4 a the interpreted lake area during 1972 2015 and the corresponding daily runoff at zyx are shown the data gap from 1978 to 1985 is due to the lack of corresponding landsat images this data gap does not impact the water balance calculation and efficiency analysis in this study which are based on the period after 2000 the variation in the lake area coincides well with that in the runoff at zyx and a deceasing trend is observed before 2000 seasonal drying started in the late 1970s and became increasingly severe in the 1980s and 1990s after the environmental flow regulation was enforced by the central government in 2000 the seasonal drying up became less severe and eventually stopped after 2004 and the lake area returned gradually the lake area became stable after around 2007 and fluctuated between 40 km2 and 60 km2 fig 4 b consists of four landsat images of the lake area in october the lake area normally reaches a maximum in october in 1995 2000 2005 and 2010 which clearly demonstrates the drying up phenomenon in the 1990s and the rapid recovery in the early period of this century as the later three images show as fig 4 c shows the runoff at ylx i e the outlet of the mountainous upper hrb exhibits no significant tendency since 1972 but the gap between the runoff at ylx and zyx continued to increase before 2000 the dashed line because the runoff at zyx is primarily caused by the runoff at ylx rather than by local precipitation the increasing gap before 2000 indicates the enhanced surface water diversion for irrigation in the middle hrb during this period after 2000 the gap dropped and then became stable reflecting the effect of flow regulation thus the waxing and waning of the terminal lake in the gobi desert have been remotely linked to human activities in the midstream oases and the environmental flow regulation turns out to be an effective control over the tradeoff between the conservation of the terminal lake and the agricultural development in the middle hrb the impact of regulation is further investigated in section 3 3 3 2 role of groundwater in lake recovery the changes in the annual water balance of the lake during 2002 2012 are shown in fig 5 a while in fig 5 b the respective changes in the annual average lake area along with the estimates of annual lake evaporation from different sources are shown as fig 5 a shows groundwater exchange comprises a significant portion of the water budget in most years and it shifts between recharge to the aquifer g 0 and discharge to the lake g 0 groundwater discharge usually occurs when the river flow input has a notable drop in contrast to the previous year such as in 2005 2007 2008 and 2010 interestingly the shift from recharge to discharge leads to an increase in lake storage and maintains the increasing tendency of the lake area this indicates that the aquifer connected to the lake acts as a buffer during the restoration period the groundwater system continued to recover due to enhanced leakage along the downstream section of the river in the years when the river flow into the terminal lake dropped the aquifer lake gradient changed its direction and the aquifer released the water stored in the previous year to the lake however this buffering effect was not present in 2003 probably because the groundwater was not sufficiently recovered at the early stage of the restoration an important implication is that the leakage loss along the river can contribute to the lake recovery due to the buffering effect although with a certain time delay the role of groundwater will be further discussed below the lake recovery progress can be further divided into two stages see fig 5b the annual average lake area increased rapidly in 2002 2007 stage 1 and became stable afterwards stage 2 fluctuating between 45 km2 and 50 km2 the reason is two fold first as shown in fig 3 there is an inflection point in the lake area at approximately 25 km2 and beyond this point the lake area becomes much less sensitive to water level increases second evaporation increases with the lake area and after 2007 the streamflow input was less than the evaporation in most years in which case the variation in lake storage was largely impacted by the groundwater flux this further demonstrates the important role of groundwater in lake restoration in addition the dashed lines in fig 5 b indicate that the uncertainty in the estimation of lake evaporation would not significantly impact our water balance calculation in fig 6 a the annual storage change v is plotted against the annual groundwater exchange g for the two stages separately the linear relations between the two variables in the two stages are both strong but distinct in the second stage v is more responsive to g fig 6 b demonstrates a linear relationship between i e and g and the regression function r2 0 869 and p 0 001 for the t test is as follows 12 g 1 4109 i e 0 0747 a regression function can also be built between the lake evaporation estimated by eqs 3 and 4 and the annual average lake area as 13 e t 0 0144 a t 0 054 the regression equation has a high r2 value of 0 9736 p 0 001 for the t test based on the data from 2002 to 2012 eq 13 approximates eqs 3 and 4 in which the annual average lake area is the only dependent variable eqs 12 and 13 provide an efficient way to estimate g with the river inflow monitored and the future lake area estimated 3 3 water efficiency of the flow regulation as mentioned before the main restoration strategy is to reduce the irrigation water from surface water diversion in the middle hrb and secure certain amounts of environmental flow at zyx under varying hydrological conditions using the heiflow model zheng et al 2020 the water conservation efficiency ef c was evaluated see fig 2 under four hypothetical scenarios of diversion reduction in the core area of the middle hrb see fig 1a with the reduction rate using the historical level in 2002 2012 as the reference ranging from 5 to 20 see table 2 in each of the hypothetical scenarios the groundwater pumping is assumed to be unchanged such that the reduction in diversion is equivalent to the reduction in total irrigation water in the core area as shown in table 2 the calculated values of ef c in the four scenarios range from 0 70 to 0 76 which implies that 24 30 of the river runoff saved from the irrigation would turn into stored water mainly aquifers in this case in the middle hrb and or evapotranspiration in non farmland areas e g river surface and riparian zone to further analyze the ef c value for the historical period of 2002 2012 the linear relationship between ef c and the amount of irrigation reduction was first constructed fig 7a based on the four scenarios in table 2 the value of ef c corresponding to the historical irrigation condition i e δd 0 was then extrapolated to be 0 690 this means that under historical conditions reducing surface water diversion by one unit in the core area of the middle hrb can lead to an increase of 0 690 units in the environmental flow towards the lower hrb in fig 7 b the linear relationship between the cumulative runoff at zyx r and the cumulative river inflow to the lake i considering 2002 as the starting point is illustrated each data point in fig 7 b represents one of the 11 years the slope of the fitted line is equal to 0 0501 which is also the constant water delivery efficiency of the downstream ef d in 2002 2012 in other words on average only 5 of the environmental flow through zyx eventually reaches the lake however the significant water loss during the river delivery i e r i mostly recharges the groundwater which can support the riparian vegetation i e transpiration and release water to the lake i e a negative g in certain circumstances and is therefore of great value for ecological services according to eq 11 the overall water efficiency of the flow regulation for lake restoration ef o during 2002 2012 is calculated to be 0 035 0 690 0 0501 which means on average only 3 5 of the reduced water diversion in the middle hrb would be converted to the increase in the flow into the terminal lake apparently ef o is largely limited by ef d because riverbed leakage is significant in the lower hrb note that 3 5 only quantifies the direct impact of the river flow on the lake area because the riverbed leakage along the river replenishes the local aquifer a portion of it may eventually contribute to the lake recovery through the buffering effect of groundwater as discussed in section 3 2 in addition riverbed loss can be beneficial to the recovery of vegetation in the lower hrb 3 4 revisiting the flow regulation the current regulation requires bottom line outflows at zyx under different inflow conditions at ylx based on a predefined flow regulation curve wu et al 2016 however the regulation does not account for the hydrological mechanisms of lake recovery as discussed in the previous section whether the regulation is an appropriate design for lake recovery has been long debated but has received few quantitative analyses the water managers in the lower hrb claim that in most years the actual flow volume at zyx did not reach the required amount while the water managers in the middle hrb complain that the regulation curve is too strict and not fair for them our system analysis of lake recovery provides a unique perspective for investigating this issue as fig 8 shows the lake area a increases rapidly with the cumulative runoff at zyx r at the early stage of the restoration and then becomes stable even as r continues to increase several important implications of this curve include the following first the one decade effort of flow regulation has recovered the lake to a stable status approximately 45 km2 on average in this sense although the target of diversion control in the middle hrb has not been fully fulfilled the regulation is still a success second the stable status is largely determined by the hydrogeological characteristics of the basin lake morphology and the historical climate conditions during which water sources and sinks for the lake roughly cancel out under historical climate conditions saving extra irrigation water in the middle hrb every year may change the recovery trajectory i e the stable status may be reached earlier but would not significantly enhance the stability level a larger lake area would only be realized if a much wetter climate or a dramatic reduction in irrigation water occurred in the hrb both of which are unlikely to happen in the near future third whether the current flow regulation is appropriate depends on how large the desired lake area is if a smaller stable lake area e g 40 km2 is acceptable the middle hrb could use more river flow for irrigation such that the flow turns to et in croplands rather than evaporates in the lake essentially this represents a tradeoff between the value of ecological services and economic benefits from a broader perspective a large lake area does not necessarily mean a better ecological outcome as discussed in section 3 3 riverbed loss would be beneficial to the recovery of vegetation in the lower hrb in addition ecosystems e g groundwater sustained wetlands in the middle hrb also face water stress xiao et al 2015 while the flow regulation has limited surface water diversion in the middle hrb and secured more water for the downstream area and the lake it also stimulated groundwater pumping and caused a decline in groundwater storage in the middle hrb wu et al 2016 a comprehensive assessment of ecological services and socioeconomic analyses is necessary to set an appropriate target for lake area recovery which deserves a separate study 4 conclusions this study performs a system analysis on the recovery of east juyan lake the terminal lake of china s second largest endorheic river basin after a decade of conservation effort by fusing meteorological and hydrological observations remote sensing data and the simulation results of an integrated ecohydrological model previous knowledge gaps in the ecohydrological mechanisms and water efficiencies of the restoration process and in the appropriateness of flow regulation are rectified the major findings include the following first the waning and waxing of the terminal lake in the gobi desert during the past two decades are largely driven by human activities in the midstream oases rather than by climate conditions after 2007 the lake area reached a stable status which was largely determined by the hydrological characteristics of the basin and lake and by the historical climate conditions second surface water groundwater interaction plays a critical role in the recovery of the lake the aquifer connected to the lake acts as a buffer receiving leakage from the lake under normal conditions but discharging water to the lake when the river flow input has a notable drop in contrast to the previous year after the lake area reached a stable status the mild interannual variation in lake storage is largely impacted by the groundwater flux third the water conservation efficiency of the midstream ef c and the water delivery efficiency of the downstream ef d under historical conditions are estimated to be 0 690 and 0 050 respectively therefore the overall water efficiency of the flow regulation for lake restoration ef o during 2002 2012 is calculated to be 0 035 this low value of ef o is mainly due to the significant leakage loss along the lower reach of the heihe river however leakage loss may contribute to the buffering effect of groundwater and the recovery of vegetation in the lower hrb overall this study represents an in depth analysis of restoring wetlands impacted by large scale human activities a common challenge faced by endorheic river basins around the world the hydrological mechanisms revealed in this study improve our understanding of the evolution of inland waters in a fast changing global environment the results of this study provide significant policy and management implications for water resource managers in the hrb and other endorheic river basins the present study is focused more on hydrology than on ecology and the interplay between the hydrologic regime and ecosystems e g the relationship between lake water storage and the health of various ecosystems in and around the lake deserves further exploration future studies also need to address the challenge in setting an appropriate target of restoration e g how large the maintained waterbody should be through a comprehensive assessment of ecological services and socioeconomic impacts in addition comparative studies across a variety of endorheic river basins would be of great value

9939,understanding the effects of the spatial distributions of soil water and nutrients on crop growth and yields is important for optimizing their management to achieve high water productivity wp under water deficit conditions in this study three spatial distributions of irrigation and nutrients were set up to winter wheat triticum aestivum l grown in 1 m deep tubes 19 2 cm inner diameter in 2017 18 and 1 4 m deep tubes in 2018 19 buried in the field the three treatments included both irrigation water and nutrients applied to the surface soil layer ns ws nutrients in the surface soil layer and irrigation applied to deep soil layer 60 cm below soil surface ns wd and nutrients and water both applied to the deep soil layer nd wd for the three main treatments each was supplied with two irrigation levels i e deficit irrigation and full irrigation at 160 mm and 240 mm respectively divided into four applications at different growing stages of winter wheat the results showed that the wheat grain yield and wp at grain yield level wpg under ns wd were the highest under deficit irrigation with yields 7 7 and 20 9 higher and wpg 9 2 and 20 4 higher than those of ns ws and nd wd averagely for the two seasons respectively the ns ws treatment resulted in the highest grain yield and wp at both grain and biomass levels wpb under full irrigation with yields 17 7 and 31 8 higher and wpg 23 4 and 38 0 higher than those of ns wd and nd wd averagely for the two seasons respectively treatments with nutrients located in deep soil layer produced the lowest yield and wp under both irrigation levels therefore nutrients should be located in the top soil layer to increase their availability for crop use anytime during the growing season water applied in the deep soil layer could benefit grain production and wpg under deficit irrigation possibly related to the increase in the proportion of the water use during reproductive growing stage to achieve higher harvest index hi under full irrigation water and nutrients matched in the topsoil layer where the roots were mostly distributed increased the availability of water and nutrients for root uptake and reduced the dry matter allocation to root growth in acquiring resources which resulted in a lower root shoot ratio higher biomass production and higher wpb the spatial soil water and nutrient distribution affected their

introduction it was projected that global wheat triticum aestivum l production will reach 758 3 million tons in 2020 and that china had the highest wheat production in 2019 134 m tons fao 2020 the north china plain ncp is one of the main wheat production regions in china producing two thirds of the national total wheat output lu and fan 2013 as the global population grows and the diet structure changes the requirement for wheat will increase increased crop production would require a continuous increase in irrigation water and fertilizer inputs gong et al 2011 li et al 2018 with the increase in water shortages around the world improving water productivity wp for wheat production will become more important in the future guo et al 2010 winter wheat and summer maize form the traditional annual double cropping system in the ncp zhu et al 1994 which requires considerable irrigation to meet the growth requirements of the two crops generally approximately 200 450 mm of irrigation water is required as supplemental irrigation to guarantee high and stable grain yields of the two crops in this region and irrigation water is mainly extracted from groundwater sun et al 2006 xiao et al 2017 2020 the overdraft of underground water has caused a rapid decline in the groundwater table and the average rate of decline of groundwater has been approximately one meter annually over the past 40 years van oort et al 2016 to reduce water consumption from groundwater regulated deficit irrigation rdi was proposed as an effective irrigation method and has been popularized in the ncp rdi is an irrigation method that uses a lower water amount than the full amount required by crops kang et al 2017 to adapt to growth requirements and climate changes rdi with the optimal irrigation timing and amount is conducted to improve wp and grain yields for example critical irrigation irrigation twice during the pre sowing and jointing periods and minimum irrigation irrigation once during the pre sowing period both significantly reduced irrigation water utilization without equivalent penalization of the grain yield zhang et al 2013 sun et al 2015 on the other hand under deficit irrigation winter wheat generally increased its root growth to allow better water extraction shepherd et al 2002 however nutrients are mainly concentrated in the surface soil layer because nutrient absorption is always accompanied by water absorption root water uptake from different locations in the root zone profile might affect the uptake of soil nutrients spatial dislocation of the water and nutrient distribution along the root zone profile might affect the resource use efficiency yan et al 2020 supplying nutrients to the subsoil could increase the root growth in deep soil layers and improve crop drought resistance bardhan et al 2021 soil water and nutrition acquisition is associated with root growth and distribution goss et al 1993 the availability of soil water at different soil depths to crop water use will depend on the root growth to reach a certain soil depth zhang et al 2004 irrigation applied to deep soil layers will become more active at the late growing stages of a crop with the deepening of the root system different location of irrigation application will affect the distribution of crop water use during the growing season and therefore the biomass accumulation harvest index and final grain production zhang et al 2013 fang et al 2021 mehrabi et al 2021 additionally root morphological characteristics affect nutrient uptake and water absorption ehdaie et al 2010 a well developed root system architecture rsa is essential for the final yields of crops proffitt et al 1985 liu et al 2018 as one of the staple foods wheat has a fibrous root system and 60 70 of the roots are distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer among the upper roots lateral roots occupy a large proportion and contribute to the absorption of water and nutrients narayanan et al 2014 chen et al 2020 various water and fertilizer application regimes lead to different soil water contents which affect the root distribution in the soil zhang et al 2017 under deficit irrigation root growth is critical for crops to use soil water robertson et al 1993 wheat is vulnerable to severe drought and absorbs more water from the deep soil profile by developing deep root systems under conditions with less water xue et al 2003 luo et al 2011 yu et al 2018 however the large root system is also a source of assimilation consumption which will reduce the shoot biomass and in turn reduce the grain yield in the ncp the deficit irrigation schedule generally applies irrigation water during the vegetative growth stages pre heading of winter wheat and the soil water contents are usually quite low during reproductive stages post heading which restricts water uptake from the surface soil in this situation when plants absorb water from the deep soil profile but nutrients are mainly distributed on the surface soil layers the dislocation of the two factors might affect the nutrient contents in the water flow in the xylem and further affect the photosynthetic rate at the leaf level abreu et al 1993 however because soil surface evaporation is closely linked to the soil moisture content soil evaporation increases with the increasing in surface soil moisture content chen et al 2018 controlling the soil water content in surface soil is vital for reducing ineffective evaporation liu et al 2015 therefore under drought and water shortage conditions in the ncp it is important to optimize the root uptake of water and nutrients by regulating the distribution of irrigation water in spatial distribution to achieve high water use efficiency yang et al 2020 understanding the effects of different distributions of water nutrients and roots on water productivity and assimilation allocation is critical for optimizing the water use by winter wheat in the ncp the objectives of this study were to use tube experiments to assess the effects of different spatial distribution conditions of nutrients and irrigation water on the root distribution above and below ground dry matter production yield and water productivity of winter wheat under deficit and full water supply conditions to provide references for better water management in the ncp 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design this study was conducted during 2017 2019 over two growing seasons of winter wheat at the luancheng agro eco experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences 37 53 n 114 40 e 50 m asl three spatial irrigation and fertilization treatments were implemented on winter wheat using column tubes the tubes were made of pvc with a 19 2 cm inner diameter and 1 m depth in the 2017 18 season and 1 4 m depth in the 2018 19 season the soil was packed into a tube at a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 the bottom of the pvc tube was sealed with thick water proof plastic film soil packed inside the tube was obtained from the surrounding field soils from 0 to 20 cm soil layer and from that below 20 cm were separately collected and mixed for packing into the tubes soil nutrient contents and texture for the two sampling locations were listed in table 1 the field capacity of the soil was 24 g g 1 and the initial soil water content was set at 22 g g 1 by adding water to mix with the soil before packing to create different spatial distributions of water and nutrients during the two growing seasons of winter wheat the soils obtained from different depths in the field were packed into the different locations of the tubes fig 1 during the growing seasons irrigations and n fertilizer were applied to different locations of the tubes the different locations of the fertile soils and the locations of n and irrigation water applications created three scenarios nutrients and water coupling on the top soil layers ns ws nutrients and water mismatching with nutrients at top soil layer and water at deep soil layer ns wd and nutrients and water coupling at deep soil layer nd wd the detailed arrangements of the soils and irrigation water application were listed in table 2 and shown in fig 1 for all the three treatments two irrigation levels of 160 mm and 240 mm were divided into four equal amounts of water applied to winter wheat at the jointing booting anthesis and grain filling stages the tubes were buried inside the field with a movable roof to prevent rainfall the two irrigation levels represented the general irrigation schedule of winter wheat in this region i e seasonal rainfall plus 60 mm irrigation as deficit irrigation and seasonal rainfall plus 140 mm irrigation as relative adequate irrigation nutrients fertilizer was applied at a rate of 4 g urea 46 n tube also divided into four equal parts to be applied at the same time with the four irrigations two small tubes inner diameter of 1 cm buried into the pvc tubes when packing were used for applying the water and nutrients into the deep soil layers fig 1 all the treatments were conducted in 6 replicates with tubes being arranged in a completely randomized design the tubes were buried in the field and surrounded with field grown winter wheat to avoid microclimate effects on crop growth rainfall was prevented using a movable shelter after emergency fine sand with depth of 1 cm was used to cover the soil surface of each tube to reduce soil evaporation the seedlings were thinned to nine plants at the three leaf stage which was similar to the density under field conditions 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 weather weather data were collected from the meteorological station 50 m away from the experimental site the daily maximum temperature c minimum temperature c average temperature c relative humidity sunshine duration h d 1 and wind speed m s 1 were recorded the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the above factors by the penman monteith equation which represents grass water requirements as the reference crop albedo 0 23 height 0 12 m and surface resistance 70 s m 1 allen et al 1998 2 2 2 agronomic and physiological parameters the plant height and number of stems in each column were measured at maturity the leaf photosynthesis rate pn were measured at the major growing stages especially at the anthesis stage four flag leaves in each column were chosen to measure pn using a co2 gas exchange system on sunny days from 11 00 to 13 00 local time li 6400 li cor inc usa the canopy temperature tc was measured by an infrared camera irc nec avio technologies co tokyo japan from anthesis to maturity for all tubes the emissivity was set at 0 98 and the images were collected at noon from 11 00 to 13 00 on sunny days the viewing angle was set at 90 c relative to the canopy and shot vertically down 2 2 3 grain yield yield components at maturity each column was harvested manually plants were cut at ground level and spike numbers were counted plants were air dried to record the dry weight and thereafter threshed to separate grains and straw and the harvest index hi was determined by dividing the grain weight by the total dry biomass kernel numbers per spike and thousand seed weights were recorded accordingly the weight of the grains was obtained at water content of 13 2 2 4 soil water contents and root measurement after the ground parts being harvested pvc columns were cut into 20 cm segments from top to bottom then the samples were taken to the laboratory first approximately 100 g of soil samples from each segment were obtained to measure the soil water contents using the oven drying method before measuring roots inside this small amount of soil were manually picked up and washed to mix with other roots which were obtained by washing the soils from each segment debris from the roots were separated manually after the root length was determined based on the line intersect method using a 1 27 cm grid tennant 1975 the roots were dried at 80 c to measure the dry weight the root length density rld cm cm 3 root shoot ratio r s ratio and specific root length srl m g 1 were calculated using the following formulas 1 rld l v 2 r s ratio total root dry weight total aboveground dry weight 3 srl 10 l m where l is the total root length cm m is the total root mass mg and v is the sampled soil volume cm3 the measured root characteristics were used to assess crop root responses to soil water variations eissenstat 1991 ahmadi et al 2018 2 3 calculations 2 3 1 evapotranspiration et evapotranspiration et mm for the whole growing season of winter wheat in this study was calculated using the following water balance equation 4 et swd p i cr d r where swd mm is the soil water depletion which is defined as the soil water content swc of the whole column at sowing after subtracting that at harvesting et is the seasonal evapotranspiration mm during the whole growth period p is precipitation mm which was zero due to the waterproof canopy being used to intercept rainfall i is the total irrigation during the growing season cr is the capillary rise to the root zone mm d is the drainage from the root zone mm and r is runoff mm the last three factors were taken as zero under the experimental conditions of this study 2 3 2 water productivity crop water productivity wp is defined as the crop yield per unit water consumption kg m 3 and it was calculated as the crop grain yield divided by seasonal et for the wp at the grain yield level wpg and as the aboveground dry weight divided by seasonal et for the wp at the biomass level wpb 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis of each factor measured in this study was performed using the spss software program version 19 0 spss for windows ibm armonk new york usa one way anova was conducted to analyze different factors among different treatments during the same season the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 was conducted when the differences were significant the figures were created using originpro 2020 originlab inc ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 temperature conditions and reference et et0 fig 2 shows the daily average temperature tave and et 0 changes from sowing to harvest during the two growing seasons there was high seasonal tave variation in the two seasons which affected the final grain production of winter wheat from the sowing to recovering stage tave in the 2017 18 season was higher than that in the 2018 19 season while during the jointing to maturity stage the 2018 19 season had a higher tave especially from the recovering stage days after sowing at 100 to the jointing stage days after sowing at 150 fig 2a fig 2b shows the daily et 0 changes during the two seasons which represent the atmospheric evaporation potential there was a large discrepancy between the two seasons during the reproductive stages of winter wheat with higher daily et0 values in 2018 19 than that in 2017 18 the cumulative et 0 in the two seasons was 430 8 mm and 561 5 mm respectively the results showed that for both seasons before winter dormancy the temperature was slightly lower than the long term average and after winter dormancy the temperature was much greater than the long term average especially in the 2018 2019 season and the atmospheric evaporation demands were also higher in this season which affected the actual crop water use 3 2 root distribution soil water consumption and seasonal et fig 3 shows the rld distribution under the three treatments at two irrigation levels in the 2017 18 and 2018 19 seasons although the depths of the tubes in the two seasons were different the distribution of rld along the soil profile showed similar trends under the two irrigation levels the rld in topsoil and subsoil was not significantly different among the different treatments except for the significant increase at approximately 60 80 cm under the nd wd treatments coupling of the water and nutrients at that depth significantly improved root growth previous studies also indicate that root length and biomass increase or decrease in response to a wide range of soil water and nutrient regimes elazab et al 2016 mehrabi et al 2021 the srl for different treatments is shown in table 3 with the increase in soil depth the srl generally increased a higher srl indicates thinner roots and a lower srl indicates thicker roots ahmadi et al 2018 de la riva et al 2021 thinner and longer roots are associated with more branching and with a high capacity for water and nutrient uptake due to increased root surface area eissenstat et al 2000 the results indicated a trend that roots in the surface soil were thicker and with the increase in soil depth roots became increasingly thinner the srl in the 20 60 cm soil layer treated under ns wd was higher than that of other treatments the reason might be the water stress condition at the surface soil layer which stimulated lateral roots to extend to deep soil layer to absorb water with the help of the rich nutrients in the top soil layer among the three treatments under the two water levels the srl in the 0 20 cm soil layer in the 2018 19 season was higher than that in the 2017 18 season this situation occurred because the pvc tube used in the second season was longer than that in the first season which favored root growth fig 4 shows the soil water contents swc along the tubes at harvest during the two seasons in the 2017 18 season the swc was quite low approaching the wilting point for the topsoil layer under the two irrigation levels with the increase in soil depth the swc slightly increased combined with the rld distribution in fig 3 these results indicated that roots at the soil surface had the ability to use all the available water while the relatively lower rld at deep soil layers restricted the full use of the soil water even though the aboveground parts encountered water stress for the 2018 2019 season the depth of the pvc tube was 1 4 m and the declining trend of the rld along the surface soil profile was more obvious than that in the 2017 2018 season the rld below 1 m was sparsely distributed and there was more available soil water left that was not fully absorbed by the root system the results indicated that the smaller rld in the deep soil layer restricted the full utilization of soil water by crops many studies have shown that an rld of at least 0 8 cm cm 3 is required for effective uptake of soil water barraclough and weir 1988 zhang et al 2004 2020 a higher rld in the deep soil layer would promote root water uptake and increase soil water availability to crop water use table 4 shows the soil water depletion swd of winter wheat and the ratio of swd to seasonal et under the three treatments in the two seasons the swd under deficit irrigation was higher than that under full irrigation for all three treatments which indicated that winter wheat had the ability to withdraw more soil water under deficit irrigation for the three treatments under deficit irrigation no significant difference in swd and swd et ratio was found for the two seasons indicating that the different locations of water and nutrients did not affect the total water use due to the limited water supply however under a full water supply ns ws tended to use more water than the other two treatments comparing the two seasons the deep tubes used in the second season increased the available soil water to the crop and both et and the ratio of swd et were greater than those for the first season a deep soil profile benefits soil water utilization by crops under water deficit conditions zhang et al 2004 kirkegaard et al 2007 3 3 biomass production and water productivity at biomass level although the total water use of the three treatments under the same irrigation level was similar a significant difference in the aboveground biomass of winter wheat at harvesting was observed for the two seasons fig 5 the highest biomass was achieved under ns wd under deficit irrigation and ns ws under full irrigation which was significantly higher than those of the other two treatments during each season the biomass of nd wd was the lowest among the three treatments under the same irrigation level it has been reported that biomass production was the major factor determining the final grain yield and lower biomass generally reduced the final yield production jin et al 2014 water consumption generally has a positive relationship with biomass production khan et al 2020 however the results from this study indicated that with similar seasonal et table 4 biomass production was distinguished due to the difference in the spatial distribution of nutrients and irrigation water supplies the difference in biomass production among different treatments might be related to the biomass allocation to belowground parts and the root shoot r s ratio a lower r s ratio might benefit the partitioning of more dry matter to the aboveground biomass to obtain higher biomass production in this study ns ws had the lowest r s ratio under deficit irrigation 0 046 and 0 045 and full irrigation 0 069 and 0 043 in the two seasons respectively the r s ratio of nd wd was the highest under deficit irrigation 0 094 and 0 089 and full irrigation 0 134 and 0 077 in the two seasons respectively fig 6 the treatment in which nutrients and water coupled to surface soil layers allocated more biomass to aboveground parts was therefore more economic for aboveground biomass production table 5 shows that there was a significant difference in water productivity at the biomass level wpb for winter wheat among the different treatments under full irrigation the highest wpb was achieved under ns ws during the two seasons the average wpb value of ns ws was 29 6 and 35 4 higher than those of ns wd and nd wd in the first season and 11 9 and 21 6 higher in the second season respectively under deficit irrigation ns wd got the highest wpb in the first season which was 13 0 and 15 1 higher than those of ns ws and nd wd respectively the wpb in the second season for ns ws and ns wd was similar both was significantly higher than nd wd the results indicated that coupling water and nutrients at the surface soil under full irrigation and supplying nutrients at surface soil and water at subsoil under deficit water supply benefited aboveground biomass production and improved water productivity at the biomass level when nutrients and water were coupled at the subsoil nd wd crops needed to increase root growth to obtain water and nutrient which resulted in a large root system in the subsoil fig 3 but the cost in producing roots would be greater when large root system occurred generally most roots of cereal crops are concentrated in the top 40 cm soil layer where water and nutrients are abundant thus reducing the cost in root growth to absorb nutrients and water it has been reported that when plants grow in productive environments they have a faster return of investment de la riva et al 2021 in contrast plants survive in a resource limiting environment tend to have a slower return of investment wright et al 2004 2005 roumet et al 2016 the coupling of water and nutrients in the top soil layer reduced the cost in soil water and nutrient uptake and enhanced the water productivity in biomass production in this study 3 4 yield harvest index and water productivity at the grain yield level under deficit irrigation dry matter accumulated by photosynthesis after flowering and transferred from the vegetative stage accounted for the main part of the final grain yield zhang et al 2013 fang et al 2021 table 6 shows that the grain yield and hi were significantly affected by different irrigation and nutrient treatments under deficit irrigation the ns wd treatment resulted in the highest yield in both seasons of 2017 18 on average 31 4 g tube 1 and 2018 19 on average 28 5 g tube 1 and the nd wd treatment produced the lowest yield in 2017 18 on average 25 6 g tube 1 and 2018 19 on average 21 8 g tube 1 harvest index hi shows the same change trend among the treatments as the grain production the possible reasons that ns ws produced lower grain yield and hi than that of ns wd might be that coupling of water and nutrients at the topsoil layer under deficit irrigation would favor root water uptake with more water consumed during the vegetative growing stages and less water available for water use during the grain filling stages which would reduce the photosynthesis activity under water deficit condition the possible differences in crop water status among the different treatments during grain filling stages could be indicated by the canopy temperature ct and leaf photosynthesis pn at the anthesis stage under deficit irrigation condition the photosynthesis rate for treatments with water applied to deep soil layer was slightly higher than the treatment with water applied at soil surface although no significant difference was found among the treatments fig 7 under full irrigation ns wd had higher leaf pn than the other two treatments higher flag leaf pn would favor more biomass production during grain fill stage which was quite important for high grain production fang et al 2021 carbohydrates produced during the grain fill stage provide the most parts of grains for cereal crops dordas 2012 post anthesis dry matter production contributes more than 60 of the final grain yield for wheat yang and zhang 2006 masoni et al 2007 the ns ws under deficit irrigation reduced the water availability during grain fill and therefore reduced the remobilization of pre anthesis photosynthetic products as well as the after anthesis products resulting in lower yield and hi asseng et al 2017 plants with lower available soil water would reduce transpiration and increase ct the measured ct during the grain filling stages indicated that the ct of the ns wd treatment was the lowest under deficit irrigation among the three treatments fig 8 which indicated that water supplied in the deep soil layer would be saved to favor crop water use during the late growing stages the lower water availability under ns ws during the grain filling stage reduced the hi and resulted in lower grain production as compared with the ns wd treatment under deficit irrigation condition table 6 the higher soil water content in the topsoil layer would also increase soil evaporation consumption which would result in less water consumption for crop transpiration although there was fine sand to reduce soil evaporation under the experimental conditions of this study soil evaporation for treatments with water supplied to the soil surface would still be greater than that supplied to deep soil layers liu et al 2002 have found that soil evaporation takes up 30 of the total et for winter wheat at the same site and soil evaporation is linearly correlated with the surface soil moisture therefore water applied into the deep soil layer would reduce the soil evaporation and increase the water availability for crop transpiration use under the full irrigation treatments the situation was different ns ws produced the highest yield and hi for both seasons table 6 the yields of ns ws were 27 7 and 32 6 g tube 1 on average in the two seasons respectively and they were significantly higher than those of the other two treatments the average yields of nd wd were 19 2 and 21 9 g tube 1 in the two seasons respectively which produced the lowest yields the high yield of ns ws was related to the higher spikes per area and seed numbers per spike table 6 table 6 also shows that nutrients and water coupling at the surface produced higher water productivity under full irrigation in the two seasons which was related to the higher biomass production and hi since et0 in the 2017 18 season was lower than that in the 2018 19 season the wpg in the first season was higher than that in the latter season table 6 different tube depths and weather also affected the values of yield and wpg for the two seasons for the two irrigation levels and the two seasons nd wd produced the lowest biomass yield hi and water productivity the results might indicate that during the earlier growth season the nutrients in the deep soil layer was not accessible to the crop root system and the lower nutrient supply reduced the aboveground growth at the earlier growth stage although the roots could access the nutrients at the later growing stages the earlier reduced crop growth might not have been replenished by the later growth another reason might be related to the deep roots which were not as effective as the surface roots in taking up nutrients because the latter had a large root surface the significantly increased root length in the deep soil layer increased the root shoot ratio which negatively affected the biomass allocation to the aboveground part the results from this study indicated that spatial distribution of soil water affected its total availability to crop water use and its availability at different growing stages of crops which influenced the biomass production grain yield and harvest index grain production could be improved under terminal drought if the water use during the vegetative growing stages was reduced and soil water availability during grain fill stage was increased ma et al 2008 yan et al 2020 yan et al 2020 reported that localized root proliferation is found in nutrient rich soils which is a critical strategy for crop nutrient acquisition their results also showed that soil dryness does not reduce nutrient uptake oldroyd and leyser 2020 wen et al 2020 therefore nutrients should be applied to the soil layers where roots are abundant to reduce the cost in root growth to absorb nutrients rational combination of water and nutrients increases the water and nutrient use efficiency and creates better interaction of the two factors li et al 2009 nutrients applied at the topsoil layers benefitted crop production under both adequate and deficient water conditions water applied to the deep soil layers favored crop production under deficit irrigation but not under adequate water supply although supplying nutrients to the subsoil could increase the rld in deep soil layers the energy needed to transfer water and nutrients would be increased which would increase the cost of producing roots de la riva et al 2021 in this study nutrients applied to the subsoil increased the r s and reduced the hi subsequently resulting in a lower yield and wpg the results from this study indicate that coupling water and nutrient management is important for high yields and resource use efficiency an interaction exists between water and nutrients and spatial changes in one factor likely affect the influences of the other factor on crop performance 4 conclusions this study showed that not only did different irrigation water supplies affect crop performance but the location of the water and nutrients applied also affected the final grain yield and wpg for winter wheat the different spatial distributions of water and nutrients affected the root distribution and dry matter allocation to below and above ground parts further resulting in variations in yield and water productivity although there was no significant difference in seasonal et the spatial distribution of water and nutrients affected the water use allocation during the vegetative and reproductive stages and carbohydrate allocation to the root system resulting in different root shoot ratios and harvest index these factors significantly affected the grain production and wpg at the grain yield level crops also respond differently to the spatial distribution of water and nutrients under different water application levels therefore it is important to manage water and nutrients based on water availability to achieve high yields and wpg the results of this study were from a column study and the wall of the column might have influenced the root growth and distribution however the column used in this study was quite deep and the crops were grown under the conditions of the field environment the results of the study could be taken as references in water and nutrient management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9939,understanding the effects of the spatial distributions of soil water and nutrients on crop growth and yields is important for optimizing their management to achieve high water productivity wp under water deficit conditions in this study three spatial distributions of irrigation and nutrients were set up to winter wheat triticum aestivum l grown in 1 m deep tubes 19 2 cm inner diameter in 2017 18 and 1 4 m deep tubes in 2018 19 buried in the field the three treatments included both irrigation water and nutrients applied to the surface soil layer ns ws nutrients in the surface soil layer and irrigation applied to deep soil layer 60 cm below soil surface ns wd and nutrients and water both applied to the deep soil layer nd wd for the three main treatments each was supplied with two irrigation levels i e deficit irrigation and full irrigation at 160 mm and 240 mm respectively divided into four applications at different growing stages of winter wheat the results showed that the wheat grain yield and wp at grain yield level wpg under ns wd were the highest under deficit irrigation with yields 7 7 and 20 9 higher and wpg 9 2 and 20 4 higher than those of ns ws and nd wd averagely for the two seasons respectively the ns ws treatment resulted in the highest grain yield and wp at both grain and biomass levels wpb under full irrigation with yields 17 7 and 31 8 higher and wpg 23 4 and 38 0 higher than those of ns wd and nd wd averagely for the two seasons respectively treatments with nutrients located in deep soil layer produced the lowest yield and wp under both irrigation levels therefore nutrients should be located in the top soil layer to increase their availability for crop use anytime during the growing season water applied in the deep soil layer could benefit grain production and wpg under deficit irrigation possibly related to the increase in the proportion of the water use during reproductive growing stage to achieve higher harvest index hi under full irrigation water and nutrients matched in the topsoil layer where the roots were mostly distributed increased the availability of water and nutrients for root uptake and reduced the dry matter allocation to root growth in acquiring resources which resulted in a lower root shoot ratio higher biomass production and higher wpb the spatial soil water and nutrient distribution affected their availability for crop use during different growing stages and influenced the allocation of dry matter to above and below ground parts optimizing the spatial distribution of nutrients and water based on water availability would benefit crop production and water productivity keywords dry matter allocation crop water productivity drought stress grain yield biomass yield specific root length 1 introduction it was projected that global wheat triticum aestivum l production will reach 758 3 million tons in 2020 and that china had the highest wheat production in 2019 134 m tons fao 2020 the north china plain ncp is one of the main wheat production regions in china producing two thirds of the national total wheat output lu and fan 2013 as the global population grows and the diet structure changes the requirement for wheat will increase increased crop production would require a continuous increase in irrigation water and fertilizer inputs gong et al 2011 li et al 2018 with the increase in water shortages around the world improving water productivity wp for wheat production will become more important in the future guo et al 2010 winter wheat and summer maize form the traditional annual double cropping system in the ncp zhu et al 1994 which requires considerable irrigation to meet the growth requirements of the two crops generally approximately 200 450 mm of irrigation water is required as supplemental irrigation to guarantee high and stable grain yields of the two crops in this region and irrigation water is mainly extracted from groundwater sun et al 2006 xiao et al 2017 2020 the overdraft of underground water has caused a rapid decline in the groundwater table and the average rate of decline of groundwater has been approximately one meter annually over the past 40 years van oort et al 2016 to reduce water consumption from groundwater regulated deficit irrigation rdi was proposed as an effective irrigation method and has been popularized in the ncp rdi is an irrigation method that uses a lower water amount than the full amount required by crops kang et al 2017 to adapt to growth requirements and climate changes rdi with the optimal irrigation timing and amount is conducted to improve wp and grain yields for example critical irrigation irrigation twice during the pre sowing and jointing periods and minimum irrigation irrigation once during the pre sowing period both significantly reduced irrigation water utilization without equivalent penalization of the grain yield zhang et al 2013 sun et al 2015 on the other hand under deficit irrigation winter wheat generally increased its root growth to allow better water extraction shepherd et al 2002 however nutrients are mainly concentrated in the surface soil layer because nutrient absorption is always accompanied by water absorption root water uptake from different locations in the root zone profile might affect the uptake of soil nutrients spatial dislocation of the water and nutrient distribution along the root zone profile might affect the resource use efficiency yan et al 2020 supplying nutrients to the subsoil could increase the root growth in deep soil layers and improve crop drought resistance bardhan et al 2021 soil water and nutrition acquisition is associated with root growth and distribution goss et al 1993 the availability of soil water at different soil depths to crop water use will depend on the root growth to reach a certain soil depth zhang et al 2004 irrigation applied to deep soil layers will become more active at the late growing stages of a crop with the deepening of the root system different location of irrigation application will affect the distribution of crop water use during the growing season and therefore the biomass accumulation harvest index and final grain production zhang et al 2013 fang et al 2021 mehrabi et al 2021 additionally root morphological characteristics affect nutrient uptake and water absorption ehdaie et al 2010 a well developed root system architecture rsa is essential for the final yields of crops proffitt et al 1985 liu et al 2018 as one of the staple foods wheat has a fibrous root system and 60 70 of the roots are distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer among the upper roots lateral roots occupy a large proportion and contribute to the absorption of water and nutrients narayanan et al 2014 chen et al 2020 various water and fertilizer application regimes lead to different soil water contents which affect the root distribution in the soil zhang et al 2017 under deficit irrigation root growth is critical for crops to use soil water robertson et al 1993 wheat is vulnerable to severe drought and absorbs more water from the deep soil profile by developing deep root systems under conditions with less water xue et al 2003 luo et al 2011 yu et al 2018 however the large root system is also a source of assimilation consumption which will reduce the shoot biomass and in turn reduce the grain yield in the ncp the deficit irrigation schedule generally applies irrigation water during the vegetative growth stages pre heading of winter wheat and the soil water contents are usually quite low during reproductive stages post heading which restricts water uptake from the surface soil in this situation when plants absorb water from the deep soil profile but nutrients are mainly distributed on the surface soil layers the dislocation of the two factors might affect the nutrient contents in the water flow in the xylem and further affect the photosynthetic rate at the leaf level abreu et al 1993 however because soil surface evaporation is closely linked to the soil moisture content soil evaporation increases with the increasing in surface soil moisture content chen et al 2018 controlling the soil water content in surface soil is vital for reducing ineffective evaporation liu et al 2015 therefore under drought and water shortage conditions in the ncp it is important to optimize the root uptake of water and nutrients by regulating the distribution of irrigation water in spatial distribution to achieve high water use efficiency yang et al 2020 understanding the effects of different distributions of water nutrients and roots on water productivity and assimilation allocation is critical for optimizing the water use by winter wheat in the ncp the objectives of this study were to use tube experiments to assess the effects of different spatial distribution conditions of nutrients and irrigation water on the root distribution above and below ground dry matter production yield and water productivity of winter wheat under deficit and full water supply conditions to provide references for better water management in the ncp 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design this study was conducted during 2017 2019 over two growing seasons of winter wheat at the luancheng agro eco experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences 37 53 n 114 40 e 50 m asl three spatial irrigation and fertilization treatments were implemented on winter wheat using column tubes the tubes were made of pvc with a 19 2 cm inner diameter and 1 m depth in the 2017 18 season and 1 4 m depth in the 2018 19 season the soil was packed into a tube at a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 the bottom of the pvc tube was sealed with thick water proof plastic film soil packed inside the tube was obtained from the surrounding field soils from 0 to 20 cm soil layer and from that below 20 cm were separately collected and mixed for packing into the tubes soil nutrient contents and texture for the two sampling locations were listed in table 1 the field capacity of the soil was 24 g g 1 and the initial soil water content was set at 22 g g 1 by adding water to mix with the soil before packing to create different spatial distributions of water and nutrients during the two growing seasons of winter wheat the soils obtained from different depths in the field were packed into the different locations of the tubes fig 1 during the growing seasons irrigations and n fertilizer were applied to different locations of the tubes the different locations of the fertile soils and the locations of n and irrigation water applications created three scenarios nutrients and water coupling on the top soil layers ns ws nutrients and water mismatching with nutrients at top soil layer and water at deep soil layer ns wd and nutrients and water coupling at deep soil layer nd wd the detailed arrangements of the soils and irrigation water application were listed in table 2 and shown in fig 1 for all the three treatments two irrigation levels of 160 mm and 240 mm were divided into four equal amounts of water applied to winter wheat at the jointing booting anthesis and grain filling stages the tubes were buried inside the field with a movable roof to prevent rainfall the two irrigation levels represented the general irrigation schedule of winter wheat in this region i e seasonal rainfall plus 60 mm irrigation as deficit irrigation and seasonal rainfall plus 140 mm irrigation as relative adequate irrigation nutrients fertilizer was applied at a rate of 4 g urea 46 n tube also divided into four equal parts to be applied at the same time with the four irrigations two small tubes inner diameter of 1 cm buried into the pvc tubes when packing were used for applying the water and nutrients into the deep soil layers fig 1 all the treatments were conducted in 6 replicates with tubes being arranged in a completely randomized design the tubes were buried in the field and surrounded with field grown winter wheat to avoid microclimate effects on crop growth rainfall was prevented using a movable shelter after emergency fine sand with depth of 1 cm was used to cover the soil surface of each tube to reduce soil evaporation the seedlings were thinned to nine plants at the three leaf stage which was similar to the density under field conditions 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 weather weather data

reference crop albedo 0 23 height 0 12 m and surface resistance 70 s m 1 allen et al 1998 2 2 2 agronomic and physiological parameters the plant height and number of stems in each column were measured at maturity the leaf photosynthesis rate pn were measured at the major growing stages especially at the anthesis stage four flag leaves in each column were chosen to measure pn using a co2 gas exchange system on sunny days from 11 00 to 13 00 local time li 6400 li cor inc usa the canopy temperature tc was measured by an infrared camera irc nec avio technologies co tokyo japan from anthesis to maturity for all tubes the emissivity was set at 0 98 and the images were collected at noon from 11 00 to 13 00 on sunny days the viewing angle was set at 90 c relative to the canopy and shot vertically down 2 2 3 grain yield yield components at maturity each column was harvested manually plants were cut at ground level and spike numbers were counted plants were air dried to record the dry weight and thereafter threshed to separate grains and straw and the harvest index hi was determined by dividing the grain weight by the total dry biomass kernel numbers per spike and thousand seed weights were recorded accordingly the weight of the grains was obtained at water content of 13 2 2 4 soil water contents and root measurement after the ground parts being harvested pvc columns were cut into 20 cm segments from top to bottom then the samples were taken to the laboratory first approximately 100 g of soil samples from each segment were obtained to measure the soil water contents using the oven drying method before measuring roots inside this small amount of soil were manually picked up and washed to mix with other roots which were obtained by washing the soils from each segment debris from the roots were separated manually after the root length was determined based on the line intersect method using a 1 27 cm grid tennant 1975 the roots were dried at 80 c to measure the dry weight the root length density rld cm cm 3 root shoot ratio r s ratio and specific root length srl m g 1 were calculated using the following formulas 1 rld l v 2 r s ratio total root dry weight total aboveground dry weight 3 srl 10 l m where l is the total root length cm m is the total root mass mg and v is the sampled soil volume cm3 the measured root characteristics were used to assess crop root responses to soil water variations eissenstat 1991 ahmadi et al 2018 2 3 calculations 2 3 1 evapotranspiration et evapotranspiration et mm for the whole growing season of winter wheat in this study was calculated using the following water balance equation 4 et swd p i cr d r where swd mm is the soil water depletion which is defined as the soil water content swc of the whole column at sowing after subtracting that at harvesting et is the seasonal evapotranspiration mm during the whole growth period p is precipitation mm which was zero due to the waterproof canopy being used to intercept rainfall i is the total irrigation during the growing season cr is the capillary rise to the root zone mm d is the drainage from the root zone mm and r is runoff mm the last three factors were taken as zero under the experimental conditions of this study 2 3 2 water productivity crop water productivity wp is defined as the crop yield per unit water consumption kg m 3 and it was calculated as the crop grain yield divided by seasonal et for the wp at the grain yield level wpg and as the aboveground dry weight divided by seasonal et for the wp at the biomass level wpb 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis of each factor measured in this study was performed using the spss software program version 19 0 spss for windows ibm armonk new york usa one way anova was conducted to analyze different factors among different treatments during the same season the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 was conducted when the differences were significant the figures were created using originpro 2020 originlab inc ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 temperature conditions and reference et et0 fig 2 shows the daily average temperature tave and et 0 changes from sowing to harvest during the two growing seasons there was high seasonal tave variation in the two seasons which affected the final grain production of winter wheat from the sowing to recovering stage tave in the 2017 18 season was higher than that in the 2018 19 season while during the jointing to maturity stage the 2018 19 season had a higher tave especially from the recovering stage days after sowing at 100 to the jointing stage days after sowing at 150 fig 2a fig 2b shows the daily et 0 changes during the two seasons which represent the atmospheric evaporation potential there was a large discrepancy between the two seasons during the reproductive stages of winter wheat with higher daily et0 values in 2018 19 than that in 2017 18 the cumulative et 0 in the two seasons was 430 8 mm and 561 5 mm respectively the results showed that for both seasons before winter dormancy the temperature was slightly lower than the long term average and after winter dormancy the temperature was much greater than the long term average especially in the 2018 2019 season and the atmospheric evaporation demands were also higher in this season which affected the actual crop water use 3 2 root distribution soil water consumption and seasonal et fig 3 shows the rld distribution under the three treatments at two irrigation levels in the 2017 18 and 2018 19 seasons although the depths of the tubes in the two seasons were different the distribution of rld along the soil profile showed similar trends under the two irrigation levels the rld in topsoil and subsoil was not significantly different among the different treatments except for the significant increase at approximately 60 80 cm under the nd wd treatments coupling of the water and nutrients at that depth significantly improved root growth previous studies also indicate that root length and biomass increase or decrease in response to a wide range of soil water and nutrient regimes elazab et al 2016 mehrabi et al 2021 the srl for different treatments is shown in table 3 with the increase in soil depth the srl generally increased a higher srl indicates thinner roots and a lower srl indicates thicker roots ahmadi et al 2018 de la riva et al 2021 thinner and longer roots are associated with more branching and with a high capacity for water and nutrient uptake due to increased root surface area eissenstat et al 2000 the results indicated a trend that roots in the surface soil were thicker and with the increase in soil depth roots became increasingly thinner the srl in the 20 60 cm soil layer treated under ns wd was higher than that of other treatments the reason might be the water stress condition at the surface soil layer which stimulated lateral roots to extend to deep soil layer to absorb water with the help of the rich nutrients in the top soil layer among the three treatments under the two water levels the srl in the 0 20 cm soil layer in the 2018 19 season was higher than that in the 2017 18 season this situation occurred because the pvc tube used in the second season was longer than that in the first season which favored root growth fig 4 shows the soil water contents swc along the tubes at harvest during the two seasons in the 2017 18 season the swc was quite low approaching the wilting point for the topsoil layer under the two irrigation levels with the increase in soil depth the swc slightly increased combined with the rld distribution in fig 3 these results indicated that roots at the soil surface had the ability to use all the available water while the relatively lower rld at deep soil layers restricted the full use of the soil water even though the aboveground parts encountered water stress for the 2018 2019 season the depth of the pvc tube was 1 4 m and the declining trend of the rld along the surface soil profile was more obvious than that in the 2017 2018 season the rld below 1 m was sparsely distributed and there was more available soil water left that was not fully absorbed by the root system the results indicated that the smaller rld in the deep soil layer restricted the full utilization of soil water by crops many studies have shown that an rld of at least 0 8 cm cm 3 is required for effective uptake of soil water barraclough and weir 1988 zhang et al 2004 2020 a higher rld in the deep soil layer would promote root water uptake and increase soil water availability to crop water use table 4 shows the soil water depletion swd of winter wheat and the ratio of swd to seasonal et under the three treatments in the two seasons the swd under deficit irrigation was higher than that under full irrigation for all three treatments which indicated that winter wheat had the ability to withdraw more soil water under deficit irrigation for the three treatments under deficit irrigation no significant difference in swd and swd et ratio was found for the two seasons indicating that the different locations of water and nutrients did not affect the total water use due to the limited water supply however under a full water supply ns ws tended to use more water than the other two treatments comparing the two seasons the deep tubes used in the second season increased the available soil water to the crop and both et and the ratio of swd et were greater than those for the first season a deep soil profile benefits soil water utilization by crops under water deficit conditions zhang et al 2004 kirkegaard et al 2007 3 3 biomass production and water productivity at biomass level although the total water use of the three treatments under the same irrigation level was similar a significant difference in the aboveground biomass of winter wheat at harvesting was observed for the two seasons fig 5 the highest biomass was achieved under ns wd under deficit irrigation and ns ws under full irrigation which was significantly higher than those of the other two treatments during each season the biomass of nd wd was the lowest among the three treatments under the same irrigation level it has been reported that biomass production was the major factor determining the final grain yield and lower biomass generally reduced the final yield production jin et al 2014 water consumption generally has a positive relationship with biomass production khan et al 2020 however the results from this study indicated that with similar seasonal et table 4 biomass production was distinguished due to the difference in the spatial distribution of nutrients and irrigation water supplies the difference in biomass production among different treatments might be related to the biomass allocation to belowground parts and the root shoot r s ratio a lower r s ratio might benefit the partitioning of more dry matter to the aboveground biomass to obtain higher biomass production in this study ns ws had the lowest r s ratio under deficit irrigation 0 046 and 0 045 and full irrigation 0 069 and 0 043 in the two seasons respectively the r s ratio of nd wd was the highest under deficit irrigation 0 094 and 0 089 and full irrigation 0 134 and 0 077 in the two seasons respectively fig 6 the treatment in which nutrients and water coupled to surface soil layers allocated more biomass to aboveground parts was therefore more economic for aboveground biomass production table 5 shows that there was a significant difference in water productivity at the biomass level wpb for winter wheat among the different treatments under full irrigation the highest wpb was achieved under ns ws during the two seasons the average wpb value of ns ws was 29 6 and 35 4 higher than those of ns wd and nd wd in the first season and 11 9 and 21 6 higher in the second season respectively under deficit irrigation ns wd got the highest wpb in the first season which was 13 0 and 15 1 higher than those of ns ws and nd wd respectively the wpb in the second season for ns ws and ns wd was similar both was significantly higher than nd wd the results indicated that coupling water and nutrients at the surface soil under full irrigation and supplying nutrients at surface soil and water at subsoil under deficit water supply benefited aboveground biomass production and improved water productivity at the biomass level when nutrients and water were coupled at the subsoil nd wd crops needed to increase root growth to obtain water and nutrient which resulted in a large root system in the subsoil fig 3 but the cost in producing roots would be greater when large root system occurred generally most roots of cereal crops are concentrated in the top 40 cm soil layer where water and nutrients are abundant thus reducing the cost in root growth to absorb nutrients and water it has been reported that when plants grow in productive environments they have a faster return of investment de la riva et al 2021 in contrast plants survive in a resource limiting environment tend to have a slower return of investment wright et al 2004 2005 roumet et al 2016 the coupling of water and nutrients in the top soil layer reduced the cost in soil water and nutrient uptake and enhanced the water productivity in biomass production in this study 3 4 yield harvest index and water productivity at the grain yield level under deficit irrigation dry matter accumulated by photosynthesis after flowering and transferred from the vegetative stage accounted for the main part of the final grain yield zhang et al 2013 fang et al 2021 table 6 shows that the grain yield and hi were significantly affected by different irrigation and nutrient treatments under deficit irrigation the ns wd treatment resulted in the highest yield in both seasons of 2017 18 on average 31 4 g tube 1 and 2018 19 on average 28 5 g tube 1 and the nd wd treatment produced the lowest yield in 2017 18 on average 25 6 g tube 1 and 2018 19 on average 21 8 g tube 1 harvest index hi shows the same change trend among the treatments as the grain production the possible reasons that ns ws produced lower grain yield and hi than that of ns wd might be that coupling of water and nutrients at the topsoil layer under deficit irrigation would favor root water uptake with more water consumed during the vegetative growing stages and less water available for water use during the grain filling stages which would reduce the photosynthesis activity under water deficit condition the possible differences in crop water status among the different treatments during grain filling stages could be indicated by the canopy temperature ct and leaf photosynthesis pn at the anthesis stage under deficit irrigation condition the photosynthesis rate for treatments with water applied to deep soil layer was slightly higher than the treatment with water applied at soil surface although no significant difference was found among the treatments fig 7 under full irrigation ns wd had higher leaf pn than the other two treatments higher flag leaf pn would favor more biomass production during grain fill stage which was quite important for high grain production fang et al 2021 carbohydrates produced during the grain fill stage provide the most parts of grains for cereal crops dordas 2012 post anthesis dry matter production contributes more than 60 of the final grain yield for wheat yang and zhang 2006 masoni et al 2007 the ns ws under deficit irrigation reduced the water availability during grain fill and therefore reduced the remobilization of pre anthesis photosynthetic products as well as the after anthesis products resulting in lower yield and hi asseng et al 2017 plants with lower available soil water would reduce transpiration and increase ct the measured ct during the grain filling stages indicated that the ct of the ns wd treatment was the lowest under deficit irrigation among the three treatments fig 8 which indicated that water supplied in the deep soil layer would be saved to favor crop water use during the late growing stages the lower water availability under ns ws during the grain filling stage reduced the hi and resulted in lower grain production as compared with the ns wd treatment under deficit irrigation condition table 6 the higher soil water content in the topsoil layer would also increase soil evaporation consumption which would result in less water consumption for crop transpiration although there was fine sand to reduce soil evaporation under the experimental conditions of this study soil evaporation for treatments with water supplied to the soil surface would still be greater than that supplied to deep soil layers liu et al 2002 have found that soil evaporation takes up 30 of the total et for winter wheat at the same site and soil evaporation is linearly correlated with the surface soil moisture therefore water applied into the deep soil layer would reduce the soil evaporation and increase the water availability for crop transpiration use under the full irrigation treatments the situation was different ns ws produced the highest yield and hi for both seasons table 6 the yields of ns ws were 27 7 and 32 6 g tube 1 on average in the two seasons respectively and they were significantly higher than those of the other two treatments the average yields of nd wd were 19 2 and 21 9 g tube 1 in the two seasons respectively which produced the lowest yields the high yield of ns ws was related to the higher spikes per area and seed numbers per spike table 6 table 6 also shows that nutrients and water coupling at the surface produced higher water productivity under full irrigation in the two seasons which was related to the higher biomass production and hi since et0 in the 2017 18 season was lower than that in the 2018 19 season the wpg in the first season was higher than that in the latter season table 6 different tube depths and weather also affected the values of yield and wpg for the two seasons for the two irrigation levels and the two seasons nd wd produced the lowest biomass yield hi and water productivity the results might indicate that during the earlier growth season the nutrients in the deep soil layer was not accessible to the crop root system and the lower nutrient supply reduced the aboveground growth at the earlier growth stage although the roots could access the nutrients at the later growing stages the earlier reduced crop growth might not have been replenished by the later growth another reason might be related to the deep roots which were not as effective as the surface roots in taking up nutrients because the latter had a large root surface the significantly increased root length in the deep soil layer increased the root shoot ratio which negatively affected the biomass allocation to the aboveground part the results from this study indicated that spatial distribution of soil water affected its total availability to crop water use and its availability at different growing stages of crops which influenced the biomass production grain yield and harvest index grain production could be improved under terminal drought if the water use during the vegetative growing stages was reduced and soil water availability during grain fill stage was increased ma et al 2008 yan et al 2020 yan et al 2020 reported that localized root proliferation is found in nutrient rich soils which is a critical strategy for crop nutrient acquisition their results also showed that soil dryness does not reduce nutrient uptake oldroyd and leyser 2020 wen et al 2020 therefore nutrients should be applied to the soil layers where roots are abundant to reduce the cost in root growth to absorb nutrients rational combination of water and nutrients increases the water and nutrient use efficiency and creates better interaction of the two factors li et al 2009 nutrients applied at the topsoil layers benefitted crop production under both adequate and deficient water conditions water applied to the deep soil layers favored crop production under deficit irrigation but not under adequate water supply although supplying nutrients to the subsoil could increase the rld in deep soil layers the energy needed to transfer water and nutrients would be increased which would increase the cost of producing roots de la riva et al 2021 in this study nutrients applied to the subsoil increased the r s and reduced the hi subsequently resulting in a lower yield and wpg the results from this study indicate that coupling water and nutrient management is important for high yields and resource use efficiency an interaction exists between water and nutrients and spatial changes in one factor likely affect the influences of the other factor on crop performance 4 conclusions this study showed that not only did different irrigation water supplies affect crop performance but the location of the water and nutrients applied also affected the final grain yield and wpg for winter wheat the different spatial distributions of water and nutrients affected the root distribution and dry matter allocation to below and above ground parts further resulting in variations in yield and water productivity although there was no significant difference in seasonal et the spatial distribution of water and nutrients affected the water use allocation during the vegetative and reproductive stages and carbohydrate allocation to the root system resulting in different root shoot ratios and harvest index these factors significantly affected the grain production and wpg at the grain yield level crops also respond differently to the spatial distribution of water and nutrients under different water application levels therefore it is important to manage water and nutrients based on water availability to achieve high yields and wpg the results of this study were from a column study and the wall of the column might have influenced the root growth and distribution however the column used in this study was quite deep and the crops were grown under the conditions of the field environment the results of the study could be taken as references in water and nutrient management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
