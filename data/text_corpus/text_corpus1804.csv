after wheat kyuma 2004 over the past 5 years taiwan has produced an average of 190 000 tonnes of rice annually faostat 2019 although the average annual rainfall in taiwan is 2500 mm water shortages often occur during the dry season because of the non uniform spatiotemporal distribution of the rainfall kuo et al 2006 agriculture accounts for 70 of the total water demand in taiwan kuo et al 2006 most of which is taken up by rice paddies irrigation is mainly based on the conventional flooding method using the farmers long experience in recent years water saving irrigation methods such as awd and system of rice intensification sri have been gradually promoted to reduce water consumption and alleviate regional water shortages such water saving methods have also been adopted in major rice growing regions in asia such as china the philippines and bangladesh belder et al 2005 song et al 2019a 2019b however these methods also require more time and effort than the conventional method tsujimoto et al 2009 and they must allow the paddies to dry out to some extent between growth stages however most countries today especially asia face significant problems such as agricultural population ageing and labour shortage in particular 76 of taiwan s agricultural management scale is 1 ha and the average farmland area is 1 1 ha moreover the farming scale is small and the hills are subdivided and scattered making agricultural operations inefficient furthermore the average age of the main farmers is 62 years old and the population of the rural labour force is ageing rapidly agriculture and food agency coa 2014 therefore applying complex and labour intensive irrigation methods is difficult the method proposed in this study can be alleviated to a certain extent through technology particularly using the iot through which the monitoring data of agricultural fields water level weather conditions temperature humidity wind direction etc can be provided to farmers as a reference and remote telemetry can be used to enable farmers to control or perform irrigation operations remotely to apply modern technology to irrigation and save water in taiwan automatic irrigation can give the correct water amount at different growth stages rather than all at once and it does not require drying paddies between growth stages in addition it can utilise rainfall as a supplement to irrigation to reduce water consumption and human labour an intelligent irrigation system was developed and a field experiment was conducted in southern taiwan to evaluate its general water use agronomic traits and crop yield with other irrigation methods and effectively save irrigation water to improve efficiency particularly during the first phase of rice cropping in taiwan which is often dry the surplus water can be used by government agencies in houses or various industries ensuring the utilisation of the country s water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area intelligent irrigation should be planned according to the local conditions and crop type as shown in fig 1 this study took place in chianan district tainan city taiwan 23 13 n 120 35 e which is the wusanto irrigation area of the chianan irrigation association and has an altitude of about 30 m the water supply and water source scheduling were sufficient and the irrigation facilities were mostly complete according to the central weather bureau https www cwb gov tw v8 c index html the average monthly temperature is 22 32 c and the average annual rainfall is about 2300 mm the total irrigated area is 1300 ha and the above meteorological conditions are representative of approximately 70 of taiwan s agricultural land kuo et al 2006 therefore the results are applicable to most of taiwan s farmland for an objective evaluation of the effect of the developed intelligent irrigation system on the water saving efficiency and yield the physical properties of the soil were also analysed all soil samples were sandy loam and the amount of leakage remained constant 2 2 intelligent irrigation system the proposed intelligent system in this study is mainly divided into three layers perception network and application the perception layer mainly uses water sensors and weather stations to record field information such as temperature rainfall wind direction humidity and water level the network and application layers use nb iot for transmission to the cloud system mobile phones or cloud systems are used for actual irrigation operation thereby mentioning all the system s components fig 2 illustrates the architecture of the cloud based intelligent irrigation system 2 2 1 perception layer field water level measurement the accuracy of the measurement is the most important for this study because it is related to the growth of crops therefore to correctly observe the irrigation water depth and calculate the amount of water diversion an automatic water inlet valve was adopted which comprised installing an ultrasonic water level gauge at the field water inlet and adding a stainless steel ruler to facilitate recording and correcting the water depth the ultrasonic water level gauge dl10 flowline inc ca usa has a measurement accuracy of 3 mm and measures the water level once per minute the ultrasonic water level gauge can be and stable and uninterrupted continuous measurement to comply with the experimental design automatic irrigation inlet valve arrangement each water inlet in the study area was equipped with an automatic water inlet valve as shown in fig 3 power was mainly supplied by a 20 w solar panel and an external battery to ensure normal operation in the event of continuous rainfall tests showed that the battery supplied enough electricity for about 1 week the system also has remote electric and manual operation modes and the amount of water can be controlled and adjusted according to the crop water demand the water inlet gate was made of stainless steel and it was installed to ensure a pollution free environment and avoid water wastage due to leakage weather station estimating the crop water demand is essential to determining the irrigation strategy and water balance a simple weather station was set up in an open and unshaded part of the study area and a central weather bureau station 4 5 km away was used to verify the collected data on the wind speed rainfall temperature and global radiation this study was conducted in the second crop season of 2017 fig 4 shows the weather data for the study period which comprised 4 years and seven crop seasons in total more than 80 of the rainfall in taiwan is concentrated in the rainy season from may to october greaves and wang 2017 therefore the first crop season often faces water shortages after the crops are planted in february the first crop season of 2018 coincided with the dry season there was little rainfall in mid april and early may and significant rainfall began in june the rainfall during the planting period was only 82 mm but the total annual rainfall was 831 2 mm due to heavy rainfall concentrated in one week and hot and dry conditions for the rest of the year the changes in the daily average temperature showed a consistent trend over the years while almost no rainfall occurred during the growth period of the first crop season in 2018 which would affect the water consumption and water saving rate of the irrigation system 2 2 2 network layer data were transmitted using nb iot nb iot is a low power wide area network which reduces power consumption for data transmission over long distances because it uses a licensed signal that is not easily interfered with mekki et al 2019 lima et al 2021 nb iot can be used in various environments such as residential and industrial areas and it uses a synchronous protocol to reduce communication delays data on the water inlet valve water level flow switch control and other information were transmitted wirelessly and a microcontroller unit mcu was used for motor control 2 2 3 application layer the intelligent irrigation system was designed based on feedback from farmers basic information such as the water level could be monitored and adjusted remotely at any time through an exclusive app as shown in fig 5 users and managers could be set to different levels of permission to set switches the intelligent irrigation system automatically detected the water level and the water flow could be adjusted automatically or manually when the water level was abnormal or there was equipment failure the app sent a push alarm through communication software and email reporting the abnormal situation and the number and location of the onsite equipment for personnel to check and manage as shown in fig 6 2 3 irrigation strategies the developed irrigation system can control the irrigation according to the water level which is an efficient and suitable approach for various operations the row spacing and density were set to 20 cm 30 cm for objective analysis of the yield fertilisers and pesticides were applied according to the original practices of the farmers the rice planted was tainan no 11 and this study started the experiment in 2017 when the second phase of rice was planted the study area was approximately 2 ha in years 1 3 in the 4th year with the support of local farmers and water conservancy agencies the test area was expanded to 13 ha according to the weather conditions in tainan an average crop season is about 120 days and the second crop season is shorter because of the effect of the summer temperatures table 1 presents the details on the study area and period different irrigation methods may affect the yield lu et al 2000 bouman and tuong 2001 chang et al 2007 therefore this study was premised on the assumption that the developed irrigation system will not affect the operation and yield of farmers to avoid conflict with farmers experience three irrigation strategies were considered conventional plant cp modified cp mcp 1 and mcp2 the cp irrigation method is the original operation method of farmers in the experimental area which is continuous flooding this irrigation method is the same as the traditional method in most asian countries and it must consume a lot of irrigation water it is not adjusted in any way in this study including the use quantity of fertilisers and pesticides only water level gauges are installed in the experimental field to monitor water volume mcp1 and mcp2 are modified using the cp irrigation method and adjusted according to the water level formulated in the taiwan irrigation rules reducing the irrigation water level by 60 80 further irrigation is not provided during the period when flooding the field is not required similar to the purpose of the awd irrigation strategy using the mcp irrigation method fields are subjected to alternating flooding and drying until the soil reaches a certain moisture level after which the field is re flooded ishfaq et al 2020 the main reason for not directly adopting the awd strategy was its low acceptance by farmers at that time fig 7 shows the differences in the irrigation water depth among the three irrigation strategies for the stages of a crop season the irrigation flow diagram is illustrated in the fig 8 2 4 calculation of the crop water demand and the water saving rate the crop water demand is also known as crop evapotranspiration and it is mainly affected by the weather soil crop variety growth stage irrigation and drainage meteorological factors have the greatest correlation with the crop water demand which can be calculated as follows 1 e t c k c e t o where k c is the crop coefficient and e t o is the reference crop water demand mm day many methods can be used depending on the weather conditions such as the modified penman blaney criddle and radiation equations to understand the changes in the crop water demand during crop seasons the penman monteith pm equation recommended by the fao was used in this study the pm equation allen et al 1998 considers atmospheric conditions and physical properties and it is most suitable for taiwan chen and kan 1997 chen et al 2014 2 e t o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where e t o is the reference crop water demand mm day 1 r n is the net radiation at the crop mj m 2 day 1 and g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature at a 2 m height c and u 2 is the wind speed at a 2 m height ms 1 e s is the saturation vapour pressure kpa and e a is the actual vapour pressure kpa δ is the slope vapour pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 the crop coefficient k c changes with the crop type and growth stage table 2 presents the crop coefficients commonly used for the first and second crop seasons of rice in taiwan kan 1979 generally the irrigation water consumption is inversely proportional to the effective rainfall when the effective rainfall is high the irrigation water consumption is reduced if the planting period is in the wet season the rainfall probability increases accordingly the water saving rate can be calculated as follows 3 s i fir 1 fir i fir 1 100 where s i is the water saving rate fir 1 is the water consumption by cp and fir i is the water consumption by mcp 2 5 statistical analysis of crop agronomic characteristics in this study randomised complete block designs were used in the field experiment to understand the differences in the effects of various irrigation treatments moreover anova was used to explore whether there are significant differences in the mean values under different treatments the study s null hypothesis is that there was no significant difference in the investigated agronomic traits under different irrigation treatments and the significance level was designed at α 5 confidence interval of 95 the investigation items of rice agronomic traits include plant height tiller number ear length ear weight and per plant grain there are 10 items in total including the number of flowers full grains plant seed rate 1000 grain weight yield plant and yield ha the data of these 10 items were substituted into the r software 4 0 1 r development core team 2021 to perform a least significant difference lsd test subsequently the significant difference analysis results of different irrigation treatments concerning agronomic traits could be obtained three irrigation strategies were considered cp mcp1 and mcp2 the areas allocated to each strategy were divided into different blocks according to the number of repetitions except for the first year the rest of the blocks included at least two repetitions then each block was divided into three sub blocks 1 m 1 m for sampling these sub blocks were expected to have higher uniformity for a more objective analysis in the differences in crop yields with different irrigation strategies such an experimental design can reduce undesirable changes due to soil heterogeneity and improve the precision of the experimental results 3 results and discussion 3 1 crop water demand and irrigation water consumption studies show that the crop evapotranspiration etc is mainly affected by the average daily temperature and radiation yin et al 2008 song et al 2018 in addition to temperature etc has a relationship with crop coefficient k c table 2 indicates that the crop coefficient k c gradually increases and decreases during the crop season and reaches its maximum during the initial to final flowering stages according to the data collected by the meteorological station installed in this study during the planting period such as temperature humidity wind direction and wind speed the reference crop water demand e t o could be calculated using the penman monteith from formula 2 then combined with the crop coefficient k c etc could be calculated the results showed that the average etc was 3280 4651 m3 ha in the first crop season and 4333 5364 m3 ha in the second crop season little difference was observed among the irrigation strategies fig 9 and 10 show the etc results for each irrigation strategy because the second crop season began in the summer the etc values were higher than in the first crop season because of the higher temperature in addition rainfall was more abundant in the summer which supplemented the irrigation water and reduced the water consumption of the second crop season with both mcp1 and mcp2 the average irrigation water consumption was close to etc or even lower for each year this shows that combining the intelligent irrigation system with an mcp irrigation strategy can achieve more efficient timely and accurate agricultural water management the irrigation water volume is not equal to etc because it does not include the supplement from rainfall in other words water was conserved figs 9 and 10 also show that the average yields were not significantly affected by the different irrigation strategies 3 2 effects of the irrigation strategy on the water saving rate and yield the experimental results showed that the water saving rate for the first crop season in 2018 was 2 9 6 5 this is significantly lower compared with the first crop seasons of other years as shown in fig 11 this is mainly because the first crop season in 2018 coincided with a drought there was only a small amount of rainfall in mid april and early may and a large amount of rainfall occurred in mid june during this period the rice was harvested and the utilisation of the effective rainfall was low this reduced the irrigation water supply and let the different irrigation strategies could not effectively reduce the water consumption the second crop season took place in the wet season may october so the effective water saving rate of each irrigation strategy significantly increased as shown in fig 12 the water saving rates in the first crop season were 2 9 18 7 which is equivalent to a volume of 214 1150 m3 ha the water saving rates in the second crop season were 8 8 19 3 which is equivalent to a volume of 493 1181 m3 ha thus combining the mcp irrigation strategies with the developed intelligent irrigation system effectively reduced water consumption especially during wet seasons although the water saving rate in the first crop season was only 2 9 18 7 the saved water can be very important in dry seasons with severe water shortages moreover the surplus water can be used in domestic water or in various industries the statistical analysis of the results for the first crop season found no significant differences in agronomic traits among the different irrigation strategies as given in table 3 as presented in table 3 other than plant height per tassel weight number of seed per tassel and weight per hill all agronomic traits were significantly different particularly the output of mcp significantly improved compared with that of cp improving the yield is not the main purpose of this study as the mcp irrigation operation strategy was modified based on the awd irrigation method moreover relevant studies have confirmed that this method cannot affect or even increase the yield cabangon et al 2004 however mcp1 and mcp2 did result in higher crop production than cp table 4 indicates that the yield in the second crop season was not significantly affected by the irrigation strategy at the α 5 probability level there were no differences in the lsd results including the other agronomic traits compared with cp the change in yield with the other two irrigation strategies was 5 18 in the first crop season although increasing yield is not the focus of this study other than plant height per tassel weight number of seed per tassel and weight per hill all agronomic traits were significantly different most of them are mcp with better agronomic characters particularly the output of mcp significantly improved compared with that of cp which demonstrates that the intelligent irrigation system and irrigation strategies protect the farmers existing rights in the second crop season the change in yield was 7 28 and the most agronomic traits did not show significant differences among the irrigation strategies table 4 the decrease in some yields is because the farmers harvested the first crop season of 2018 earlier owing to the drought for the other crop seasons the changes during the study period were not large combining the intelligent irrigation system with mcp will not affect the rights and interests of farmers nor will it affect the rice quality in addition it will reduce labour costs note that the irrigation strategies were based on adjusting the flood irrigation method that the farmers were used to the irrigation strategy can in fact be set according to the user s habits which would affect the benefits to the yield and water consumption owing to the different settings 4 conclusions through the monitoring and transmission of information using iot farmers can understand the situations of their farmlands and perform remote or automated irrigation operations to improve irrigation efficiency iot systems are particularly useful in asian regions facing agricultural population ageing especially in taiwan where agriculture occupies 70 of the country s water needs moreover taiwan has a limited labour force hence an intelligent irrigation system was thus developed to assist and automate field irrigation the system could accurately control the amount of irrigation water to save water without affecting the crop yield this is mainly due to the development of a suitable operational strategy which can be customised according to user needs the experimental results for 4 years 2017 2020 and seven crop seasons showed that the water saving rate was 2 9 6 5 during the dry season despite the lack of rainfall and was 8 8 19 3 during the wet season the irrigation strategies adopted in this study reduced the water consumption of farmers by 60 80 no obvious effects on the yield were observed which demonstrates that the intelligent irrigation system and irrigation strategies could protect the existing rights of farmers the benefits of this system can be increased by combining it with currently popular irrigation methods e g awd sri or intermittent irrigation moreover the system can be controlled and monitored remotely using an app and be customised according to user needs future studies will involve collecting field data with this system and combining it with artificial intelligence big data and or neural networks to improve its sophistication and efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

irrigation water depth among the three irrigation strategies for the stages of a crop season the irrigation flow diagram is illustrated in the fig 8 2 4 calculation of the crop water demand and the water saving rate the crop water demand is also known as crop evapotranspiration and it is mainly affected by the weather soil crop variety growth stage irrigation and drainage meteorological factors have the greatest correlation with the crop water demand which can be calculated as follows 1 e t c k c e t o where k c is the crop coefficient and e t o is the reference crop water demand mm day many methods can be used depending on the weather conditions such as the modified penman blaney criddle and radiation equations to understand the changes in the crop water demand during crop seasons the penman monteith pm equation recommended by the fao was used in this study the pm equation allen et al 1998 considers atmospheric conditions and physical properties and it is most suitable for taiwan chen and kan 1997 chen et al 2014 2 e t o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where e t o is the reference crop water demand mm day 1 r n is the net radiation at the crop mj m 2 day 1 and g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature at a 2 m height c and u 2 is the wind speed at a 2 m height ms 1 e s is the saturation vapour pressure kpa and e a is the actual vapour pressure kpa δ is the slope vapour pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 the crop coefficient k c changes with the crop type and growth stage table 2 presents the crop coefficients commonly used for the first and second crop seasons of rice in taiwan kan 1979 generally the irrigation water consumption is inversely proportional to the effective rainfall when the effective rainfall is high the irrigation water consumption is reduced if the planting period is in the wet season the rainfall probability increases accordingly the water saving rate can be calculated as follows 3 s i fir 1 fir i fir 1 100 where s i is the water saving rate fir 1 is the water consumption by cp and fir i is the water consumption by mcp 2 5 statistical analysis of crop agronomic characteristics in this study randomised complete block designs were used in the field experiment to understand the differences in the effects of various irrigation treatments moreover anova was used to explore whether there are significant differences in the mean values under different treatments the study s null hypothesis is that there was no significant difference in the investigated agronomic traits under different irrigation treatments and the significance level was designed at α 5 confidence interval of 95 the investigation items of rice agronomic traits include plant height tiller number ear length ear weight and per plant grain there are 10 items in total including the number of flowers full grains plant seed rate 1000 grain weight yield plant and yield ha the data of these 10 items were substituted into the r software 4 0 1 r development core team 2021 to perform a least significant difference lsd test subsequently the significant difference analysis results of different irrigation treatments concerning agronomic traits could be obtained three irrigation strategies were considered cp mcp1 and mcp2 the areas allocated to each strategy were divided into different blocks according to the number of repetitions except for the first year the rest of the blocks included at least two repetitions then each block was divided into three sub blocks 1 m 1 m for sampling these sub blocks were expected to have higher uniformity for a more objective analysis in the differences in crop yields with different irrigation strategies such an experimental design can reduce undesirable changes due to soil heterogeneity and improve the precision of the experimental results 3 results and discussion 3 1 crop water demand and irrigation water consumption studies show that the crop evapotranspiration etc is mainly affected by the average daily temperature and radiation yin et al 2008 song et al 2018 in addition to temperature etc has a relationship with crop coefficient k c table 2 indicates that the crop coefficient k c gradually increases and decreases during the crop season and reaches its maximum during the initial to final flowering stages according to the data collected by the meteorological station installed in this study during the planting period such as temperature humidity wind direction and wind speed the reference crop water demand e t o could be calculated using the penman monteith from formula 2 then combined with the crop coefficient k c etc could be calculated the results showed that the average etc was 3280 4651 m3 ha in the first crop season and 4333 5364 m3 ha in the second crop season little difference was observed among the irrigation strategies fig 9 and 10 show the etc results for each irrigation strategy because the second crop season began in the summer the etc values were higher than in the first crop season because of the higher temperature in addition rainfall was more abundant in the summer which supplemented the irrigation water and reduced the water consumption of the second crop season with both mcp1 and mcp2 the average irrigation water consumption was close to etc or even lower for each year this shows that combining the intelligent irrigation system with an mcp irrigation strategy can achieve more efficient timely and accurate agricultural water management the irrigation water volume is not equal to etc because it does not include the supplement from rainfall in other words water was conserved figs 9 and 10 also show that the average yields were not significantly affected by the different irrigation strategies 3 2 effects of the irrigation strategy on the water saving rate and yield the experimental results showed that the water saving rate for the first crop season in 2018 was 2 9 6 5 this is significantly lower compared with the first crop seasons of other years as shown in fig 11 this is mainly because the first crop season in 2018 coincided with a drought there was only a small amount of rainfall in mid april and early may and a large amount of rainfall occurred in mid june during this period the rice was harvested and the utilisation of the effective rainfall was low this reduced the irrigation water supply and let the different irrigation strategies could not effectively reduce the water consumption the second crop season took place in the wet season may october so the effective water saving rate of each irrigation strategy significantly increased as shown in fig 12 the water saving rates in the first crop season were 2 9 18 7 which is equivalent to a volume of 214 1150 m3 ha the water saving rates in the second crop season were 8 8 19 3 which is equivalent to a volume of 493 1181 m3 ha thus combining the mcp irrigation strategies with the developed intelligent irrigation system effectively reduced water consumption especially during wet seasons although the water saving rate in the first crop season was only 2 9 18 7 the saved water can be very important in dry seasons with severe water shortages moreover the surplus water can be used in domestic water or in various industries the statistical analysis of the results for the first crop season found no significant differences in agronomic traits among the different irrigation strategies as given in table 3 as presented in table 3 other than plant height per tassel weight number of seed per tassel and weight per hill all agronomic traits were significantly different particularly the output of mcp significantly improved compared with that of cp improving the yield is not the main purpose of this study as the mcp irrigation operation strategy was modified based on the awd irrigation method moreover relevant studies have confirmed that this method cannot affect or even increase the yield cabangon et al 2004 however mcp1 and mcp2 did result in higher crop production than cp table 4 indicates that the yield in the second crop season was not significantly affected by the irrigation strategy at the α 5 probability level there were no differences in the lsd results including the other agronomic traits compared with cp the change in yield with the other two irrigation strategies was 5 18 in the first crop season although increasing yield is not the focus of this study other than plant height per tassel weight number of seed per tassel and weight per hill all agronomic traits were significantly different most of them are mcp with better agronomic characters particularly the output of mcp significantly improved compared with that of cp which demonstrates that the intelligent irrigation system and irrigation strategies protect the farmers existing rights in the second crop season the change in yield was 7 28 and the most agronomic traits did not show significant differences among the irrigation strategies table 4 the decrease in some yields is because the farmers harvested the first crop season of 2018 earlier owing to the drought for the other crop seasons the changes during the study period were not large combining the intelligent irrigation system with mcp will not affect the rights and interests of farmers nor will it affect the rice quality in addition it will reduce labour costs note that the irrigation strategies were based on adjusting the flood irrigation method that the farmers were used to the irrigation strategy can in fact be set according to the user s habits which would affect the benefits to the yield and water consumption owing to the different settings 4 conclusions through the monitoring and transmission of information using iot farmers can understand the situations of their farmlands and perform remote or automated irrigation operations to improve irrigation efficiency iot systems are particularly useful in asian regions facing agricultural population ageing especially in taiwan where agriculture occupies 70 of the country s water needs moreover taiwan has a limited labour force hence an intelligent irrigation system was thus developed to assist and automate field irrigation the system could accurately control the amount of irrigation water to save water without affecting the crop yield this is mainly due to the development of a suitable operational strategy which can be customised according to user needs the experimental results for 4 years 2017 2020 and seven crop seasons showed that the water saving rate was 2 9 6 5 during the dry season despite the lack of rainfall and was 8 8 19 3 during the wet season the irrigation strategies adopted in this study reduced the water consumption of farmers by 60 80 no obvious effects on the yield were observed which demonstrates that the intelligent irrigation system and irrigation strategies could protect the existing rights of farmers the benefits of this system can be increased by combining it with currently popular irrigation methods e g awd sri or intermittent irrigation moreover the system can be controlled and monitored remotely using an app and be customised according to user needs future studies will involve collecting field data with this system and combining it with artificial intelligence big data and or neural networks to improve its sophistication and efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9021,nitrate contamination in ground and surface water is a persistent problem in agricultural countries the transition zone between rivers and riparian aquifers plays an important role in mediating riverine nitrate export as it promotes intensive denitrification resulting in permanent nitrate removal from aquatic systems however the underlying mechanisms controlling riparian denitrification are not well understood in this study we present an assessment of water chemistry and isotope data from a two year river and groundwater sampling period along a coastal watershed in southeast china the results showed that the highest oxygen depletion and denitrification rates in the riparian aquifer occurred in the infiltrated river proportions with higher groundwater temperatures heterotrophic microbial responses in the riparian zone may have been driven by bioavailable organic carbon from the river water in the riparian aquifer for the underlying processes of no3 removal efficiency from riparian groundwater the additional processes substantially surpassed denitrification mean of 12 1 vs 6 6 particularly at the furthest distance from the river in winter the mean proportional contribution of manure and sewage 54 5 was the highest for nitrate contamination followed by soil n fertilizer 23 7 chemical fertilization 18 5 and atmospheric deposition 3 3 this study provides valuable guidance for agricultural water management based on the key finding that high connectivity between rivers and groundwater might improve the no3 removal potential keywords riparian zone nitrification water chemistry nitrate stable isotopes denitrification groundwater contamination data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excessive nitrogen n tends to move into different environmental media leading to a series of cascading environmental changes that negatively affect both humans and ecosystems he et al 2017 nitrate no3 pollution in groundwater is a growing concern for drinking water supply and ecological health of surface waters in china ablah et al 2020 yu et al 2019 with implications for agricultural water management and river restoration gao et al 2021 kou et al 2021 riparian zones which connect terrestrial and aquatic habitats have a high capacity for natural reduction of no3 contamination and serve as no3 buffers along rivers li et al 2020a stutter et al 2021 various forms of n in the riparian zone can be effectively assimilated transformed or permanently removed by n transformation processes trauth et al 2018 vidon and hill 2004 however n transformation in groundwater does not occur consistently and is influenced by several variables no3 removal in riparian groundwater occurs through a variety of processes including no3 denitrification to n2 or n2o plant uptake microbial assimilation no3 isomerization to ammonium and anaerobic ammonium oxidation which consumes no2 from no3 or nh4 hill 2019 xuan et al 2022 while these processes diminish the probability of direct no3 contamination only denitrification leads to permanent no3 removal from riparian ecosystems through the release of n2 and n2o bonaglia et al 2014 kuypers et al 2018 ammonium microbial absorption and plant uptake result in n retention in riparian ecosystems and anaerobic ammonium oxidation requires no3 reduction to no2 by denitrifying bacteria before no2 and nh4 can be converted to n2 beaulieu et al 2011 kuypers et al 2018 as stored n may eventually be nitrated to no3 and leached into riparian groundwater additional processes may only result in temporary no3 removal thus contrasting with permanent no3 removal from riparian groundwater through denitrification lutz et al 2020 winter et al 2022 to accurately characterize the consequences of no3 in riparian ecosystems distinguishing denitrification from other biogeochemical processes that impact no3 removal and determining their relative contribution in riparian groundwater is necessary quantifying denitrification rate is challenging because the end product of the transformation i e n2 or n2o is difficult to measure owing to high background concentrations li et al 2020b the dual nitrate stable isotope 15n no3 18o no3 method is useful for differentiating n sources in rivers and groundwater as each source tends to have a unique isotopic signature xuan et al 2020 2019 no3 isotopic compositions also documented transformation processes associated with n transport from the source to the receiving water body torres martínez et al 2020 dual no3 stable isotope approaches combined with bayesian statistical models have been widely used to evaluate n transformation processes and sources in surface and groundwater for example atmospheric n deposition nitrification and denitrification processes in groundwater and rivers have been quantified using dual no3 stable isotope data gu et al 2013 huang et al 2020 a dual stable isotope approach was applied to quantify the major sources of riverine no3 in forested agricultural and urban watersheds hu et al 2021 2019 in most studies dual isotope records were obtained for short periods of time 1 y impeding an accurate evaluation of riverine n dynamics and sources owing to temporal variability yang et al 2013 yi et al 2017 in addition few studies have attempted to explore n transformation processes particularly no3 removal by combining isotopes and water chemistry hu et al 2021 minet et al 2017 xue et al 2009 yi et al 2017 in this study we examined watershed no3 sources and cycling over two years using multiple isotopes 15n no3 18o no3 and monthly records of water chemistry from streams and groundwater in the huashan creek watershed southeastern china the main objectives of this comprehensive analysis were to 1 reveal the spatiotemporal variability of n in rivers and groundwater 2 assess n cycling and no3 removal processes in riparian groundwater and 3 identify key factors controlling denitrification activity in riparian groundwater the outcomes of this study may enhance our knowledge of n dynamics and underlying mechanical controls in the riparian zone 2 material and methods 2 1 study area over the past two decades the jiulong river watershed jrw has witnessed a persistent decline in water quality and the zhangzhou municipality located downstream of the jrw is one of china s most developed agriculture production region huang et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 the creek catchment which drains over 50 of agricultural land offers various tropical fruits and vegetables nitrogen input from chemical n fertilizer application as well as livestock production have caused river pollution through direct runoff and baseflow producing more than 21 000 tons of n loads per year displaying the lowest ecosystem services value and the highest level of unhealthy status in jrw ervinia et al 2019 lin et al 2021 to further understand n contamination in the jrw groundwater was sampled from an agriculture dominated plain area in the huashan creek catchment 116 54 117 31 n 24 02 24 35 e fig 1 located in the middle huashan creek catchment the plain river system marked as the transition zone from the steep mountainous to the coastal plain watershed shares a 2 km river network with jrw with average annual streamflow of 21 9 m3 s 1 as a typical agricultural watershed the river section of the study area is a riparian vegetation zone consisting of a 50 m stretch with wide honey pomelo trees lin et al 2021 zhou et al 2016 2 2 sampling and experimental design 2 2 1 groundwater and river water sampling twenty four sites including 22 groundwater sites and 2 river sites were sampled monthly for 1 water temperature wtemp 2 ph 3 total dissolved solids tds 4 dissolved oxygen do 5 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 6 nitrite nitrogen no2 n 7 nitrate nitrogen no3 n 8 total nitrogen tn 9 chloride cl 10 dissolved organic carbon doc and 11 stable isotopes δ15n and δ18o of no3 n in a 2 km stream section within the huashan catchment during 2020 2022 to characterize their spatial relationship with the river we divided the 22 wells into three distance groups near groundwater 25 m intermediate groundwater 25 100 m and distant groundwater 100 m a portable multiparameter meter was used to analyze wtemp do tds and ph during groundwater pumping subsequently the water samples were stored at 4 and filtered through 0 45 µm nucleopore membranes before the n analysis nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn within 24 h of sampling were determined using standard methodology huang et al 2020 the doc was measured using a shimadzu toc 5050a analyzer shimadzu corporation japan tokyo cl was analyzed using a model mp523 05 chloride ion concentration meter sanxin china shanghai 2 2 2 stable isotope analysis this study employed a bayesian isotope combined with stable isotope analysis in the r siar model to quantify the proportional contributions of possible no3 n sources to groundwater the data in this method consists of n samples of j isotopes with k sources which can be stated as follows parnell et al 2010 torres martínez et al 2020 1 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij 2 s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 3 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 4 ε jk n 0 σ j 2 where x ij represents the measured isotope value j of the water sample i p k represents the proportional contribution of source k s jk represents the source value k of isotope j on source k normally distributed with mean μ jk and ω jk 2 c jk is the fractionation factor for isotope j on source k normally distributed with mean μ jk and ω jk 2 ε jk is the residual error described by the model and σ j 2 is estimated by the model the model was executed 100 000 times over 50 000 iterations siar diagnostics were used to measure convergence after subtracting 15 from the chain length δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were used to quantify no3 sources of groundwater contamination in the huashan creek catchment which consists of four potential sources atmospheric deposition ad chemical nitrogen fertilizer nf nitrogen from soil ns and manure and sewage m s yang et al 2016 yu et al 2020 the ranges of the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of ad nf ns and m s are presented in table 1 derived from the experiment in the jrw and previously published investigations huang et al 2020 ji et al 2017 liu et al 2018 2 3 statistical methods 2 3 1 linear mixing model assuming that cl is a stable solute a linear mixing model was used to quantify the proportion of the no3 source mixing occurs between two independent end members which in this study are river and groundwater and is influenced by river water infiltration lutz et al 2020 xue et al 2009 supplemental text 1 introduces detailed methods for river water fraction calculations to determine the fraction of river water in riparian groundwater friv supplemental text 2 contains denitrification and additional fractionation processes to quantify the mixing and degradation of a pollutant in a scenario of two mixing sources and degradation using compound specific isotope data 2 3 2 statistical analysis spearman s rank correlation was used to explore the correlation between the measured variables trauth et al 2018 based on the spearman rank correlation results a subset of predicting variables was used in a multivariate regression approach based on partial least squares regression pls which is robust to collinearity in the predicting variables for variable ranking only predicted variables with variable importance in projection vip values above 1 are important chin 2010 the pls regression variables were normalized and recorded when the binary relationships exhibited a significant nonlinear behavior spearman rank correlation and pls analyses were performed using the r software 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal variation of physiochemical parameters the wtemp ph tds monthly concentrations of do nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn as well as seasonal concentrations of cl and doc are shown in table 2 and figs 2 and 3 the samples ph values did not exhibit significant temporal fluctuations generally river water had a ph of 7 whereas all groundwater samples regardless of the distance from the river had a ph of approximately 6 fig 2a table 2 the temperature of the river and groundwater varied seasonally but did not vary with proximity to the river fig 2b the concentration of do in river water was usually at saturation because oxygen solubility in water usually decreases with increasing temperature and do was lowest in summer and highest in winter fig 2c temporal difference in tds was not significant in the river water showing a fluctuating groundwater trend of high levels in summer and low in winter and a decrease with distance from the river fig 2d mean values of nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn in the river and groundwater indicate an increasing trend from rivers to distant groundwater fig 2e h owing to dilution the concentration of cl decreased with increasing discharge fig 3a the concentration of doc was greater in the river than groundwater table 2 doc concentration variation was less in groundwater than in river water and the concentration increased with decreasing distance from groundwater to the river fig 3b 3 2 n cycling process identification the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for stream rivers and groundwater in the basin cross section ranged from 5 37 17 19 and 4 05 11 93 respectively fig 4a d most groundwater δ15n and δ18o values were within the range of ammoniacal n fertilization and soil n isotopes denitrification was present at nearly half of the groundwater sites and at close proximity to the riverbank δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were significantly positively correlated r2 0 82 p 0 05 n 96 suggesting that in addition to nitrification other n transformation processes in the riparian zone may be present such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation and denitrification the theoretical no3 concentrations were predicted using a mixing model no3 mix as shown in supplementary text 1 the calculated concentration of no3 increased slightly at some sampling sites especially at low concentrations of no3 which may indicate nitrification activity however because none of the isotope data show signs and ammonia concentrations in groundwater are often too low to detect nitrification is unlikely to be significant at our study site the intermediate groundwater area generally had higher absolute no3 concentrations and deficits than those in the near groundwater area in addition the deficit was larger in summer than in winter the δ15n values showed increasing enrichment and no3 deficits for the near and intermediate groundwater fig 4 to further quantify the possible contribution of no3 contamination in groundwater the siar mixing model was used to determine the no3 stable isotope values in different seasons in the studied catchment fig 5 our results showed that ns and m s were the primary contributors to no3 contamination in shallow groundwater the mean proportional contribution of m s 54 5 was the highest followed by ns 23 7 nf and ad with average contributions of 18 5 and 3 3 respectively the principal no3 contributions of ns in spring and summer were 64 7 and 43 0 respectively followed by those of m s 11 2 and 41 9 respectively nf 18 5 and 12 7 respectively and ad 2 7 and 1 8 respectively the principal no3 contributions of m s in autumn and winter were 46 3 and 55 0 respectively followed by ns 27 6 and 23 7 respectively nf 22 1 and 16 7 respectively and ad 3 4 and 3 1 respectively 3 3 spatial patterns of no3 removal efficiency to analyze spatial and seasonal patterns of no3 removal efficiency in riparian groundwater we separately calculated the denitrification rden and the removal rates by addition processes radd during the summer months of 2021 and 2022 the rden in the individual wells varied from 0 to 30 2 mean of 12 1 fig 6a denitrification was highest in sections a and b and lowest in section c no3 removal by additional biogeochemical processes during summer was high in section a and low in sections b and c fig 6b the denitrification rate during winter fig 6c was considerably higher than that during the summer months and did not exceed radd the mean rden in all wells was 6 6 range 0 15 1 fig 6c and the mean removal rate by additional biogeochemical processes during winter was radd 11 4 range 0 55 6 fig 6d overall rden was generally higher during summer than winter and radd values showed insignificant differences between the seasons fig 6 3 4 correlation analysis and pls model results scatterplot clustering limits and regressions were conducted to reveal the influence of river proximity on no3 removal mechanism in riparian groundwater the lowest do and highest δ15n values were observed in the near and intermediate groundwater whereas the wtemp was higher than 20 fig 7a b the concentration of δ15n near groundwater is directly related to anaerobic conditions fig 7c which are necessary for denitrification in comparison the wtemp in distant groundwater had no impact on do and δ15n and the composition of δ15n was insensitive to do concentration consequently the proximity to the river is crucial for determining aerobic respiration and denitrification by calculating the friv value the linear mixing model showed that when friv was high the δ15n isotopic signatures were often highly enriched fig 7d spearman s rank correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between the measured and calculated parameters fig 8 for do weak correlations r 0 3 0 5 with doc positive and δ15n negative were observed for δ15n tds negative and no3 negative were significantly correlated with δ15n r 0 5 for doc weak correlations were found with wtemp positive to further explore the influence of river proximity only the groundwater variables were shown on table 3 were included in pls regression analysis wtemp ph and doc were used for pls analysis as predictive variables and do and δ15n were the responding variables the model illustrated 54 0 and 47 0 do and δ15n variances respectively the results showed that wtemp accounts for 78 7 and 54 3 of the variances in do and δ15n respectively 4 discussion 4 1 key controlling factors for no3 removal denitrification intensity of groundwater in riparian zones mainly depends on whether there are sufficient nitrogen and carbon sources as electron donors and receptors respectively galloway et al 2004 trauth et al 2018 our results indicate that infiltrating river water in riparian groundwater promotes denitrification activity low do concentrations may have resulted from intense heterotrophic aerobic respiration induced by riverine carbon and oxygen sources diem et al 2013 in contrast δ15n component increased as do concentration decreased fig 8 which is related to the inhibitory action of do on anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification hill 2019 hu et al 2021 according to rivett et al 2008 denitrification increases dramatically below a do content of approximately 2 mg l 1 which is consistent with our findings xue et al 2009 reported similar observations on the favorable influence of river proximity on groundwater denitrification activity represented by the normally greater doc concentration of the riparian zone groundwater than infiltrating river water in our study this view was further supported by the high consumption of do caused by heterotrophic aerobic respiration of bioavailable carbon in riverine water bodies in the nearshore groundwater area based on our existing doc concentration data further elucidation of the potential relationship between bioavailable carbon and denitrification activity is challenging hosono et al 2015 additionally carbon may be vulnerable to unknown depletion rates through aerobic respiration hill 2019 hosono et al 2015 4 2 nitrate removal potential in the riparian zone mechanistic analysis and statistical methods are typically used to determine the effect of the riparian zone on no3 removal from groundwater bu et al 2017 the volume of no3 removed was calculated for each well in the near and intermediate zones and the combination of isotopic composition and apparent enrichment factors fig 6 the highest no3 removal rates in this area were found in the summer near the groundwater zone when they ranged from 15 to 60 only 20 40 variations were observed in the intermediate zone the no3 removal rate estimates based on isotopic data showed less seasonality however the highest no3 removal rates were also calculated during summer and the smaller δ15n values explain low removal rates during this period fig 4 in addition the isotopic approach produced higher removal rates in intermediate than in nearby groundwater zones using a linear mixed model both methods produced removal rates similar to those of no3 removal rates reported in other studies trauth et al 2018 during the entire period the average no3 removal rates in the nearby and intermediate groundwater zones were 11 3 and 12 3 respectively these values suggest that the total no3 removal rate was almost similar in the intermediate and nearby groundwater zones and that the slightly lower removal rates in the intermediate zone were related to the higher no3 concentrations in groundwater in this zone thayalakumaran et al 2008 weatherill et al 2018 4 3 n cycling processes and sources no3 is the main form of dissolved inorganic n present in the jrw and is primarily influenced by agricultural activities huang et al 2021 we assessed the potential contributions of nf ns ad and m s to no3 in groundwater using the siar model our results show that m s 54 5 contributed the largest proportion followed by ns 23 7 nf and ad with average contributions of 18 5 and 3 3 respectively huang et al 2020 used a siar model and found that chemical fertilizers and soil nf inputs were the primary contributors to no3 contamination of surface water in the jrw unlike the contributions of stand alone agricultural activities such as chemical fertilizer and soil nf to surface water n output no3 pollution of groundwater is influenced in several ways by m s ns and nf it was assumed that due to subsurface runoff nitrogen and synthetic fertilizers in the soil were the main causes of surface and groundwater contamination and manure and sewage remained in the groundwater but did not enter the surface water huang et al 2020 ji et al 2017 however the contribution of no3 from the four typical pollution sources showed spatial and temporal variability in the different seasons the contribution of soil n sources was significantly higher in spring and summer crop growing season than in autumn and winter one way anova p 0 01 with high fertilizer application and rainfall in spring and summer nitrogen in the soil surface layer dissolves in water under the effect of rainfall dissolution and scouring and nitrification occurs in runoff to produce no3 which ultimately enters the water body with surface runoff or loamy midstream xuan et al 2020 xuan et al 2019 therefore watershed management in spring and summer can be improved by optimizing the use of chemical fertilizers to reduce runoff losses huang et al 2020 ji et al 2017 the contributions of manure and domestic wastewater were significantly higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer respectively in autumn and winter the contribution rate increased as rainfall decreased and point source pollution increased however manure and domestic wastewater were lower than in autumn probably because of low temperature in winter which limits microbial transport transformations yi et al 2017 in addition the contribution of ad was consistently the lowest in all four seasons with no significant difference indicating that the contribution of natural sources of no3 is negligible compared to the contribution of anthropogenic sources 4 4 implication for watershed management in this catchment intensified agricultural activities have significantly affected local groundwater quality because of excessive application of n fertilizers therefore comprehensive measures are urgently required to reduce soil no3 accumulation and loss gao et al 2021 given the high proportion of sewage and manure sourced with the largest variation in riparian groundwater the effective management of leaky sewers and septic systems is also important huang et al 2021 in pinghe county nutrient losses from crop systems have decreased since 2006 indicating the success of the national soil testing and fertilizer application project initiated in 2005 chen and zhang 2006 xu 2019 found that pomelo yield did not decrease when n and p fertilizer inputs were reduced by 43 and 45 respectively therefore optimizing n fertilizer management and increasing the return of manure and crop straw to the field will be an effective integrated strategy to reduce n discharge in the watershed in the future chen et al 2021 based on previous studies on n removal in riparian zones our study emphasizes that in addition to temperature the interaction between river and groundwater and the resulting water and nutrient fluxes play a key role in controlling reaction rates lutz et al 2020 trauth et al 2018 by revealing no3 removal potential in the riparian zone we found that managing a critical buffer zone for denitrification in the riparian zone 25 m such as by constructing artificial wetlands would greatly reduce groundwater n entry to the river rivett et al 2008 therefore the n application rate in orchards must be optimized massive no3 storage in the vadose zone might result in groundwater no3 contamination in a catchment and a long term in situ monitoring system should be established in the buffer zone to evaluate pollutant reduction biodiversity and water ecosystem health recovery hill 2019 owing to the retention and long term accumulation of pollutants in the buffer zone the zone may become a pollutant source if not efficiently managed galloway et al 2004 rivett et al 2008 consequently research on the management mechanism of vegetation buffer zones should be conducted according to

9021,nitrate contamination in ground and surface water is a persistent problem in agricultural countries the transition zone between rivers and riparian aquifers plays an important role in mediating riverine nitrate export as it promotes intensive denitrification resulting in permanent nitrate removal from aquatic systems however the underlying mechanisms controlling riparian denitrification are not well understood in this study we present an assessment of water chemistry and isotope data from a two year river and groundwater sampling period along a coastal watershed in southeast china the results showed that the highest oxygen depletion and denitrification rates in the riparian aquifer occurred in the infiltrated river proportions with higher groundwater temperatures heterotrophic microbial responses in the riparian zone may have been driven by bioavailable organic carbon from the river water in the riparian aquifer for the underlying processes of no3 removal efficiency from riparian groundwater the additional processes substantially surpassed denitrification mean of 12 1 vs 6 6 particularly at the furthest distance from the river in winter the mean proportional contribution of manure and sewage 54 5 was the highest for nitrate contamination followed by soil n fertilizer 23 7 chemical fertilization 18 5 and atmospheric deposition 3 3 this study provides valuable guidance for agricultural water management based on the key finding that high connectivity between rivers and groundwater might improve the no3 removal potential keywords riparian zone nitrification water chemistry nitrate stable isotopes denitrification groundwater contamination data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excessive nitrogen n tends to move into different environmental media leading to a series of cascading environmental changes that negatively affect both humans and ecosystems he et al 2017 nitrate no3 pollution in groundwater is a growing concern for drinking water supply and ecological health of surface waters in china ablah et al 2020 yu et al 2019 with implications for agricultural water management and river restoration gao et al 2021 kou et al 2021 riparian zones which connect terrestrial and aquatic habitats have a high capacity for natural reduction of no3 contamination and serve as no3 buffers along rivers li et al 2020a stutter et al 2021 various forms of n in the riparian zone can be effectively assimilated transformed or permanently removed by n transformation processes trauth et al 2018 vidon and hill 2004 however n transformation in groundwater does not occur consistently and is influenced by several variables no3 removal in riparian groundwater occurs through a variety of processes including no3 denitrification to n2 or n2o plant uptake microbial assimilation no3 isomerization to ammonium and anaerobic ammonium oxidation which consumes no2 from no3 or nh4 hill 2019 xuan et al 2022 while these processes diminish the probability of direct no3 contamination only denitrification leads to permanent no3 removal from riparian ecosystems through the release of n2 and n2o bonaglia et al 2014 kuypers et al 2018 ammonium microbial absorption and plant uptake result in n retention in riparian ecosystems and anaerobic ammonium oxidation requires no3 reduction to no2 by denitrifying bacteria before no2 and nh4 can be converted to n2 beaulieu et al 2011 kuypers et al 2018 as stored n may eventually be nitrated to no3 and leached into riparian groundwater additional processes may only result in temporary no3 removal thus contrasting with permanent no3 removal from riparian groundwater through denitrification lutz et al 2020 winter et al 2022 to accurately characterize the consequences of no3 in riparian ecosystems distinguishing denitrification from other biogeochemical processes that impact no3 removal and determining their relative contribution in riparian groundwater is necessary quantifying denitrification rate is challenging because the end product of the transformation i e n2 or n2o is difficult to measure owing to high background concentrations li et al 2020b the dual nitrate stable isotope 15n no3 18o no3 method is useful for differentiating n sources in rivers and groundwater as each source tends to have a unique isotopic signature xuan et al 2020 2019 no3 isotopic compositions also documented transformation processes associated with n transport from the source to the receiving water body torres martínez et al 2020 dual no3 stable isotope approaches combined with bayesian statistical models have been widely used to evaluate n transformation processes and sources in surface and groundwater for example atmospheric n deposition nitrification and denitrification processes in groundwater and rivers have been quantified using dual no3 stable isotope data gu et al 2013 huang et al 2020 a dual stable isotope approach was applied to quantify the major sources of riverine no3 in forested agricultural and urban watersheds hu et al 2021 2019 in most studies dual isotope records were obtained for short periods of time 1 y impeding an accurate evaluation of riverine n dynamics and sources owing to temporal variability yang et al 2013 yi et al 2017 in addition few studies have attempted to explore n transformation processes particularly no3 removal by combining isotopes and water chemistry hu et al 2021 minet et al 2017 xue et al 2009 yi et al 2017 in this study we examined watershed no3 sources and cycling over two years using multiple isotopes 15n no3 18o no3 and monthly records of water chemistry from streams and groundwater in the huashan creek watershed southeastern china the main objectives of this comprehensive analysis were to 1 reveal the spatiotemporal variability of n in rivers and groundwater 2 assess n cycling and no3 removal processes in riparian groundwater and 3 identify key factors controlling denitrification activity in riparian groundwater the outcomes of this study may enhance our knowledge of n dynamics and underlying mechanical controls in the riparian zone 2 material and methods 2 1 study area over the past two decades the jiulong river watershed jrw has witnessed a persistent decline in water quality and the zhangzhou municipality located downstream of the jrw is one of china s most developed agriculture production region huang et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 the creek catchment which drains over 50 of agricultural land offers various tropical fruits and vegetables nitrogen input from chemical n fertilizer application as well as livestock production have caused river pollution through direct runoff and baseflow producing more than 21 000 tons of n loads per year displaying the lowest ecosystem services value and the highest level of unhealthy status in jrw ervinia et al 2019 lin et al 2021 to further understand n contamination in the jrw groundwater was sampled from an agriculture dominated plain area in the huashan creek catchment 116 54 117 31 n 24 02 24 35 e fig 1 located in the middle huashan creek catchment the plain river system marked as the transition zone from the steep mountainous to the coastal plain watershed shares a 2 km river network with jrw with average annual streamflow of 21 9 m3 s 1 as a typical agricultural watershed the river section of the study area is a riparian vegetation zone consisting of a 50 m stretch with wide honey pomelo trees lin et al 2021 zhou et al 2016 2 2 sampling and experimental design 2 2 1 groundwater and river water sampling twenty four sites including 22 groundwater sites and 2 river sites were sampled monthly for 1 water temperature wtemp 2 ph 3 total dissolved solids tds 4 dissolved oxygen do 5 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 6 nitrite nitrogen no2 n 7 nitrate nitrogen no3 n 8 total nitrogen tn 9 chloride cl 10 dissolved organic carbon doc and 11 stable isotopes δ15n and δ18o of no3 n in a 2 km stream section within the huashan catchment during 2020 2022 to characterize their spatial relationship with the river we divided the 22 wells into three distance groups near groundwater 25 m intermediate groundwater 25 100 m and distant groundwater 100 m a portable multiparameter meter was used to analyze wtemp do tds and ph during groundwater pumping subsequently the water samples were stored at 4 and filtered through 0 45 µm nucleopore membranes before the n analysis nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn within 24 h of sampling were determined using standard methodology huang et al 2020 the doc was measured using a shimadzu toc 5050a analyzer shimadzu corporation japan tokyo cl was analyzed using a model mp523 05 chloride ion concentration meter sanxin china shanghai 2 2 2 stable isotope analysis this study employed a bayesian isotope combined with stable isotope analysis in the r siar model to quantify the proportional contributions of possible no3 n sources to groundwater the data in this method consists of n samples of j isotopes with k sources which can be stated as follows parnell et al 2010 torres martínez et al 2020 1 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij 2 s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 3 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 4 ε jk n 0 σ j 2 where x ij represents the measured isotope value j of the water sample i p k represents the proportional contribution of source k s jk represents the source value k of isotope j on source k normally distributed with mean μ jk and ω jk 2 c jk is the fractionation factor for isotope j on source k normally distributed with mean μ jk and ω jk 2 ε jk is the residual error described by the model and σ j 2 is estimated by the model the model was executed 100 000 times over 50 000 iterations siar diagnostics were used to measure convergence after subtracting 15 from the chain length δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were used to quantify no3 sources of groundwater contamination in the huashan creek catchment which consists of four potential sources atmospheric deposition ad chemical nitrogen fertilizer nf nitrogen from soil ns and manure and sewage m s yang et al 2016 yu et al 2020 the ranges of the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of ad nf ns and m s are presented in table 1 derived from the experiment in the jrw and previously published investigations huang et al 2020 ji et al 2017 liu et al 2018 2 3 statistical methods 2 3 1 linear mixing model assuming that cl is a stable solute a linear mixing model was used to quantify the proportion of the no3 source mixing occurs between two independent end members which in this study are river and groundwater and is influenced by river water infiltration lutz et al 2020 xue et al 2009 supplemental text 1 introduces detailed methods for river water fraction calculations to determine the fraction of river water in riparian groundwater friv supplemental text 2 contains denitrification and additional fractionation processes to quantify the mixing and degradation of a pollutant in a scenario of two mixing sources and degradation using compound specific isotope data 2 3 2 statistical analysis spearman s rank correlation was used to explore the correlation between the measured variables trauth et al 2018 based on the spearman rank correlation results a subset of predicting variables was used in a multivariate regression approach based on partial least squares regression pls which is robust to collinearity in the predicting variables for variable ranking only predicted variables with variable importance in projection vip values above 1 are important chin 2010 the pls regression variables were normalized and recorded when the binary relationships exhibited a significant nonlinear behavior spearman rank correlation and pls analyses were performed using the r software 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal variation of physiochemical parameters the wtemp ph tds monthly concentrations of do nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn as well as seasonal concentrations of cl and doc are shown in table 2 and figs 2 and 3 the samples ph values did not exhibit significant temporal fluctuations generally river water had a ph of 7 whereas all groundwater samples regardless of the distance from the river had a ph of approximately 6 fig 2a table 2 the temperature of the river and groundwater varied seasonally but did not vary with proximity to the river fig 2b the concentration of do in river water was usually at saturation because oxygen solubility in water usually decreases with increasing temperature and do was lowest in summer and highest in winter fig 2c temporal difference in tds was not significant in the river water showing a fluctuating groundwater trend of high levels in summer and low in winter and a decrease with distance from the river fig 2d mean values of nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn in the river and groundwater indicate an increasing trend from rivers to distant groundwater fig 2e h owing to dilution the concentration of cl decreased with increasing discharge fig 3a the concentration of doc was greater in the river than groundwater table 2 doc concentration variation was less in groundwater than in river water and the concentration increased with decreasing distance from groundwater to the river fig 3b 3 2 n cycling process identification the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for stream rivers and groundwater in the basin cross section ranged from 5 37 17 19 and 4 05 11 93 respectively fig 4a d most groundwater δ15n and δ18o values were within the range of ammoniacal n fertilization and soil n isotopes denitrification was present at nearly half of the groundwater sites and at close proximity to the riverbank δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were significantly positively correlated r2 0 82 p 0 05 n 96 suggesting that in addition to nitrification other n transformation processes in the riparian zone may be present such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation and denitrification the theoretical no3 concentrations were predicted using a mixing model no3 mix as shown in supplementary text 1 the calculated concentration of no3 increased slightly at some sampling sites especially at low concentrations of no3 which may indicate nitrification activity however because none of the isotope data show signs and ammonia concentrations in groundwater are often too low to detect nitrification is unlikely to be significant at our study site the intermediate groundwater area generally had higher absolute no3 concentrations and deficits than those in the near groundwater area in addition the deficit was larger in summer than in winter the δ15n values showed increasing enrichment and no3 deficits for the near and intermediate groundwater fig 4 to further quantify the possible contribution of no3 contamination in groundwater the siar mixing model was used to determine the no3 stable isotope values in different seasons in the studied catchment fig 5 our results showed that ns and m s were the primary contributors to no3 contamination in shallow groundwater the mean proportional contribution of m s 54 5 was the highest followed by ns 23 7 nf and ad with average contributions of 18 5 and 3 3 respectively the principal no3 contributions of ns in spring and summer were 64 7 and 43 0 respectively followed by those of m s 11 2 and 41 9 respectively nf 18 5 and 12 7 respectively and ad 2 7 and 1 8 respectively the principal no3 contributions of m s in autumn and winter were 46 3 and 55 0 respectively followed by ns 27 6 and 23 7 respectively nf 22 1 and 16 7 respectively and ad 3 4 and 3 1 respectively 3 3 spatial patterns of no3 removal efficiency to analyze spatial and seasonal patterns of no3 removal efficiency in riparian groundwater we separately calculated the denitrification rden and the removal rates by addition processes radd during the summer months of 2021 and 2022 the rden in the individual wells varied from 0 to 30 2 mean of 12 1 fig 6a denitrification was highest in sections a and b and lowest in section c no3 removal by additional biogeochemical processes during summer was high in section a and low in sections b and c fig 6b the denitrification rate during winter fig 6c was considerably higher than that during the summer months and did not exceed radd the mean rden in all wells was 6 6 range 0 15 1 fig 6c and the mean removal rate by additional biogeochemical processes during winter was radd 11 4 range 0 55 6 fig 6d overall rden was generally higher during summer than winter and radd values showed insignificant differences between the seasons fig 6 3 4 correlation analysis and pls model results scatterplot clustering limits and regressions were conducted to reveal the influence of river proximity on no3 removal mechanism in riparian groundwater the lowest do and highest δ15n values were observed in the near and intermediate groundwater whereas the wtemp was higher than 20 fig 7a b the concentration of δ15n near groundwater is directly related to anaerobic conditions fig 7c which are necessary for denitrification in comparison the wtemp in distant groundwater had no impact on do and δ15n and the composition of δ15n was insensitive to do concentration consequently the proximity to the river is crucial for determining aerobic respiration and denitrification by calculating the friv value the linear mixing model showed that when friv was high the δ15n isotopic signatures were often highly enriched fig 7d spearman s rank correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between the measured and calculated parameters fig 8 for do weak correlations r 0 3 0 5 with doc positive and δ15n negative were observed for δ15n tds negative and no3 negative were significantly correlated with δ15n r 0 5 for doc weak correlations were found with wtemp positive to further explore the influence of river proximity only the groundwater variables were shown on table 3 were included in pls regression analysis wtemp ph and doc were used for pls analysis as predictive variables and do and δ15n were the responding variables the model illustrated 54 0 and 47 0 do and δ15n variances respectively the results showed that wtemp accounts for 78 7 and 54 3 of the variances in do and δ15n respectively 4 discussion 4 1 key controlling factors for no3 removal denitrification intensity of groundwater in riparian zones mainly depends on whether there are sufficient nitrogen and carbon sources as electron donors and receptors respectively galloway et al 2004 trauth et al 2018 our results indicate that infiltrating river water in riparian groundwater promotes denitrification activity low do concentrations may have resulted from intense heterotrophic aerobic respiration induced by riverine carbon and oxygen sources diem et al 2013 in contrast δ15n component increased as do concentration decreased fig 8 which is related to the inhibitory action of do on anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification hill 2019 hu et al 2021 according to rivett et al 2008 denitrification increases dramatically below a do content of approximately 2 mg l 1 which is consistent with our findings xue et al 2009 reported similar observations on the favorable influence of river proximity on groundwater denitrification activity represented by the normally greater doc concentration of the riparian zone groundwater than infiltrating river water in our study this view was further supported by the high consumption of do caused by heterotrophic aerobic respiration of bioavailable carbon in riverine water bodies in the nearshore groundwater area based on our existing doc concentration data further elucidation of the potential relationship between bioavailable carbon and denitrification activity is challenging hosono et al 2015 additionally carbon may be vulnerable to unknown depletion rates through aerobic respiration hill 2019 hosono et al 2015 4 2 nitrate removal potential in the riparian zone mechanistic analysis and statistical methods are typically used to determine the effect of the riparian zone on no3 removal from groundwater bu et al 2017 the volume of no3 removed was calculated for each well in the near and intermediate zones and the combination of isotopic composition and apparent enrichment factors fig 6 the highest no3 removal rates in this area were found in the summer near the groundwater zone when they ranged from 15 to 60 only 20 40 variations were observed in the intermediate zone the no3 removal rate estimates based on isotopic data showed less seasonality however the highest no3 removal rates were also calculated during summer and the smaller δ15n values explain low removal rates during this period fig 4 in addition the isotopic approach produced higher removal rates in intermediate than in nearby groundwater zones using a linear mixed model both methods produced removal rates similar to those of no3 removal rates reported in other studies trauth et al 2018 during the entire period the average no3 removal rates in the nearby and intermediate groundwater zones were 11 3 and 12 3 respectively these values suggest that the total no3 removal rate was almost similar in the intermediate and nearby groundwater zones and that the slightly lower removal rates in the intermediate zone were related to the higher no3 concentrations in groundwater in this zone thayalakumaran et al 2008 weatherill et al 2018 4 3 n cycling processes and sources no3 is the main form of dissolved inorganic n present in the jrw and is primarily influenced by agricultural activities huang et al 2021 we assessed the potential contributions of nf ns ad and m s to no3 in groundwater using the siar model our results show that m s 54 5 contributed the largest proportion followed by ns 23 7 nf and ad with average contributions of 18 5 and 3 3 respectively huang et al 2020 used a siar model and found that chemical fertilizers and soil nf inputs were the primary contributors to no3 contamination of surface water in the jrw unlike the contributions of stand alone agricultural activities such as chemical fertilizer and soil nf to surface water n output no3 pollution of groundwater is influenced in several ways by m s ns and nf it was assumed that due to subsurface runoff nitrogen and synthetic fertilizers in the soil were the main causes of surface and groundwater contamination and manure and sewage remained in the groundwater but did not enter the surface water huang et al 2020 ji et al 2017 however the contribution of no3 from the four typical pollution sources showed spatial and temporal variability in the different seasons the contribution of soil n sources was significantly higher in spring and summer crop growing season than in autumn and winter one way anova p 0 01 with high fertilizer application and rainfall in spring and summer nitrogen in the soil surface layer dissolves in water under the effect of rainfall dissolution and scouring and nitrification occurs in runoff to produce no3 which ultimately enters the water body with surface runoff or loamy midstream xuan et al 2020 xuan et al 2019 therefore watershed management in spring and summer can be improved by optimizing the use of chemical fertilizers to reduce runoff losses huang et al 2020 ji et al 2017 the contributions of manure and domestic wastewater were significantly higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer respectively in autumn and winter the contribution rate increased as rainfall decreased and point source pollution increased however manure and domestic wastewater were lower than in autumn probably because of low temperature in winter which limits microbial transport transformations yi et al 2017 in addition the contribution of ad was consistently the lowest in all four seasons with no significant difference indicating that the contribution of natural sources of no3 is negligible compared to the contribution of anthropogenic sources 4 4 implication for watershed management in this catchment intensified agricultural activities have significantly affected local groundwater quality because of excessive application of n fertilizers therefore comprehensive measures are urgently required to reduce soil no3 accumulation and loss gao et al 2021 given the high proportion of sewage and manure sourced with the largest variation in riparian groundwater the effective management of leaky sewers and septic systems is also important huang et al 2021 in pinghe county nutrient losses from crop systems have decreased since 2006 indicating the success of the national soil testing and fertilizer application project initiated in 2005 chen and zhang 2006 xu 2019 found that pomelo yield did not decrease when n and p fertilizer inputs were reduced by 43 and 45 respectively therefore optimizing n fertilizer management and increasing the return of manure and crop straw to the field will be an effective integrated strategy to reduce n discharge in the watershed in the future chen et al 2021 based on previous studies on n removal in riparian zones our study emphasizes that in addition to temperature the interaction between river and groundwater and the resulting water and nutrient fluxes play a key role in controlling reaction rates lutz et al 2020 trauth et al 2018 by revealing no3 removal potential in the riparian zone we found that managing a critical buffer zone for denitrification in the riparian zone 25 m such as by constructing artificial wetlands would greatly reduce groundwater n entry to the river rivett et al 2008 therefore the n application rate in orchards must be optimized massive no3 storage in the vadose zone might result in groundwater no3 contamination in a catchment and a long term in situ monitoring system should be established in the buffer zone to evaluate pollutant reduction biodiversity and water ecosystem health recovery hill 2019 owing to the retention and long term accumulation of pollutants in the buffer zone the zone may become a pollutant source if not efficiently managed galloway et al 2004 rivett et al 2008 consequently research on the management mechanism of vegetation buffer zones should be conducted according to the actual conditions of each region they can function sustainably by establishing management systems and measures for vegetation buffer zones 4 5 strengths or limitations this study assessed the efficiency of no3 removal from riparian groundwater based on a monthly sampling campaign the accuracy of no3 removal efficiency may be affected by the temporal resolution of our data considering that monthly data do not allow the capture of short term variations in no3 production and transformation in the riparian zone the uncertainties in rtot result from the assumption of instantaneous end member mixing are thus inherited from the concentration based mixing model via fr iv calculation eq 1 and no3 mix eq 2 in the supplementary material the assumption of instantaneous mixing is valid as long as travel times from the end members to the riparian zone are short or end member concentrations and isotope values remain stable over time however estimates of flow velocities in distant groundwater using the darcy equation suggest flow velocities of less than 3 m day 1 and thus comparably short travel times to the riparian zone fujian province minnan geological brigade 2018 therefore we consider the uncertainties associated with the assumption of instantaneous mixing to be small compared with the model applications for systems with less permeable aquifers despite these promising results further research should be conducted to investigate the underlying mechanism of no3 removal at finer time scales in the entire riparian zone system future methods should consider in situ n and flow monitoring with high frequency samplers to investigate short term variations in no3 removal in addition multi media observations and no3 removal efficiency in soil water should be evaluated for the entire riparian zone system 5 conclusions our study was designed to assess the no3 removal efficiency of riparian groundwater using a monthly sampling program over two years by coupling stable isotopes and water chemistry this study found that river water infiltration strongly affected groundwater hydrochemistry and stable isotopes here the depletion of dissolved oxygen and enrichment of no3 molecules δ15n and δ18o provide evidence of denitrification particularly during the summer months using a simple exponential model temperature ph and doc explained 54 0 of the variance in do and

a benchmark for wine grape cultivation under drip fertigation in north china and other regions with similar environmental conditions keywords irrigation level fertilization rate water use efficiency partial factor productivity of fertilizer comprehensive evaluation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wine grape vitis vinifera l is a perennial crop widely grown all over the world in recent years wine grape growing is expanding rapidly in china and most growing regions are located in the north and northwest china in the vicinity of 38 n liang et al 2014 however the limited water resource in these regions restricts the sustainable development of a wine grape industry additionally local farmers lack efficient field water and fertilizer management strategies which lower water and fertilizer use efficiency as well as result in waste of resources and pollution of water resource wang et al 2021a water is one of the most critical factors determining vineyard performance sebastian et al 2015 many scholars have reported the effects of irrigation on vine growth intrigliolo et al 2016 reported that compared with rainfed vines irrigation with 50 of the estimated evapotranspiration demand during post veraison could increase yield by 30 kyraleou et al 2016 showed that phenolic compounds in seed and skin were richer in full and deficit irrigated vines than those in non irrigated ones however excessive irrigation will be adverse for it causes vigorous vegetative growth and denser canopies which can not only increase canopy management practices but also influence berry exposure and thereby lower berry quality chaves et al 2007 dokoozlian and kliewer 1996 munitz et al 2017 conversely deficit irrigation if properly implemented is helpful to achieve a balance between vegetative and reproductive growth of vines maintain yield and improve berry quality chaves et al 2007 munitz et al 2017 such as increasing total soluble solids and reducing sugars polyphenols and anthocyanins basile et al 2011 ju et al 2019 yang et al 2020 in addition deficit irrigation also enhances water use efficiency significantly collins et al 2010 santos et al 2007 concluded that 50 of the crop evapotranspiration from fruit set to three weeks before harvest was sufficient to maintain the moscatel yield potential with doubled water use efficiency fertilizer is also an important factor affecting the yield and quality of wine grapes in some vineyards with sandy soils it is imperative to supply mineral nitrogen at optimal rates to guarantee the vine yield due to limited organic matter and low nitrogen availability brunetto et al 2016 stefanello et al 2020a nitrogen requirements of vines are commonly about 40 80 kg ha 1 a 1 lang et al 2018 excessive nitrogen induces redundant vegetative growth and unbalanced sink source ratio affecting sugar translocation and thus decreasing anthocyanin accumulation which results in poorly colored berries lang et al 2018 stefanello et al 2021 effects of phosphorous and potassium on wine grapes were also reported schreiner et al 2013 found that low phosphorous and low potassium supply did not alter vine growth or yield davies et al 2004 reported that excessive potassium decreased the free acid and led to a ph increase in berries however ciotta et al 2021 reported that potassium application did not have effects on must composition including total soluble solids ph and total titratable acidity previous studies have focused largely on the effects of single irrigation and fertilization on yield and quality of wine grape studies on the influences of water and fertilizer coupling are still scarce however irrigation and fertilizer need to be managed synchronously in practical farming drip fertigation is an advanced technology combining micro irrigation with fertilization which can directly deliver water and nutrients to crop roots li et al 2021 this technology provides convenience for studying the effects of water and fertilizer coupling recently walker et al 2021 reported the influences of water and fertilizer treatments on vine vegetative growth yield and grape composition through drip fertigation showing that the effects were marginal inconsistent and largely affected by climatic conditions for wine grape cultivation multi objective optimization of yield berry quality and environmental benefits is essential therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify the coupling effects of different irrigation and fertilization amounts on yield berry quality water use efficiency wue and partial factor productivity of fertilizer pfpf 2 to develop an optimal irrigation and fertilization management strategy based on a multi criteria optimization using different evaluation methods such as gray relational analysis gra technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and combinational evaluation method cem 2

respectively 3 results 3 1 meteorological data the meteorological data during the three growth seasons are displayed in fig s4 the average solar radiation from budbreak to harvest was 237 95 w m 2 222 43 w m 2 and 210 87 w m 2 in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the hottest year was 2019 among three years and its accumulated value of growing degree days gdd from budbreak to harvest was 129 3 c and 161 1 c higher than that in 2020 and 2021 respectively precipitation showed ample fluctuations from budbreak to harvest ranging from a minimum of 235 6 mm in 2021 to a maximum of 406 0 mm in 2020 3 2 effects of irrigation on transpiration and effects of fertilization on spad when averaged across the fertilization rates the total transpiration during the whole growth stage was in the range of 231 77 279 06 mm 195 46 245 53 mm and 154 80 223 86 mm in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the proportions of transpiration at different stages were different 34 2 41 7 for berry growth stage 33 1 39 5 for berry veraison stage 13 4 20 9 for shoot growth stage and only 5 0 11 8 for anthesis stage overall there was a tendency that transpiration was higher in ih treatment than that in im and il treatments fig 1 compared with ih treatment im treatment decreased total transpiration by 20 7 at berry veraison stage in 2019 il treatment decreased total transpiration by 27 4 at berry veraison stage in 2019 39 6 at shoot growth stage in 2020 as well as 57 3 30 9 and 28 4 at anthesis stage berry growth stage and berry veraison stage in 2021 respectively showing significant differences from ih treatment fig 1 when averaged across the irrigation levels on each date in 2020 and 2021 spad values were always decreased as the fertilization amounts were reduced at 30 and 60 days after anthesis in 2020 as well as 60 and 90 days after anthesis in 2021 significant differences were found among different fertilization treatments fig 2 3 3 effects of irrigation and fertilization on grape yield and berry quality effects of irrigation and fertilization on yield and quality of wine grape are shown in table 2 grape yield was significantly affected by years and ranged from 8765 to 9793 kg ha 1 across the different years both irrigation levels and fertilization rates had a significant effect on grape yield averaged across the years and fertilization rates compared with ih treatment im treatment increased the yield by 6 0 and il treatment decreased the yield by 9 4 averaged across the years and irrigation levels compared with fh treatment fm treatment did not significantly affect the yield but fl treatment decreased the yield by 10 3 table 2 years significantly affected all berry quality parameters irrigation levels significantly affected titratable acid and sugar acid ranging from 0 574 to 0 643 and from 24 78 to 29 73 across the different irrigation levels respectively averaged across the years and fertilization rates compared with ih treatment im and il treatments decreased titratable acid by 3 3 and 10 7 respectively im and il treatments increased sugar acid ratio by 12 2 and 20 0 respectively for soluble sugars total polyphenols anthocyanins and condensed tannins no significant differences were observed among irrigation levels fertilization rates had a significant effect only on anthocyanins and condensed tannins averaged across the years and irrigation levels fm treatment presented the highest anthocyanins 4 66 mg g 1 and condensed tannins 3 19 mg g 1 compared with fh and fl treatments while the differences between fh treatment and fl treatment were not significant the interaction effects between irrigation and fertilization did not significantly affect yield and berry quality table 2 3 4 effects of irrigation and fertilization on et iwue wue and pfpf et was analyzed by averaging the data of different fertilizer treatments within each irrigation treatment im and il treatments significantly decreased et compared with ih treatment during the three seasons with a decrease of 10 2 15 4 and 17 1 27 9 respectively fig 3 years had a significant effect on iwue and wue but not on pfpf iwue ranged from 4 88 to 6 46 kg m 3 across the different years and the maximum value was found in 2020 wue showed a small variation in the range of 2 23 2 50 kg m 3 from year to year and the greatest value was observed in 2021 table 3 irrigation levels had a significant effect on iwue and wue averaged across the years and fertilization rates compared with ih treatment im treatment increased the iwue and wue by 33 1 and 20 5 respectively il treatment increased the iwue and wue by 50 3 and 13 8 respectively table 3 irrigation levels also significantly affected pfpf compared with ih treatment im treatment increased the pfpf by 7 0 while il treatment decreased the pfpf by 9 0 table 3 the effects of fertilization rates were significant on iwue but not on wue compared with fh treatment fm treatment hardly affected the iwue and fl treatment decreased the iwue by 10 3 table 3 fertilization rates significantly increased pfpf up to 22 86 kg kg 1 with the decreasing fertilization rates averaged across the years and irrigation levels compared with fh treatment fm and fl treatments increased the pfpf by 25 4 and 49 4 respectively table 3 the interaction between irrigation levels and fertilization rates did not significantly affect iwue and wue but had a significant effect on pfpf table 3 pfpf lay in the range of 13 75 27 53 13 52 24 86 and 15 10 24 37 kg kg 1 in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the highest pfpf was always observed in imfl treatment while the lowest was always found in ilfh treatment in the three years table s1 3 5 comprehensive evaluation of different treatments with gra topsis and cem the weight of each evaluation parameter was calculated through ahp table s2 gra topsis and cem were used to identify the optimal treatment and the results are shown in table 4 in the case of cem in 2019 2020 and 2021 the top three treatments were imfm ilfm imfh imfm imfh imfl and imfh ihfm imfm respectively when averaged across the three years the top three treatments were imfm imfh ihfm overall imfm treatment was the best treatment which can best balance the yield berry quality wue and pfpf but ihfh was the poorest treatment 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation on transpiration and effects of fertilization on spad the transpiration showed a clear stage pattern in each of the three years the total transpiration during berry growth stage was the largest followed by berry veraison stage and then shoot growing stage and finally anthesis stage fig 1 this trend can be explained by duration of each stage about 35 15 55 and 55 days for shoot growth stage anthesis stage berry growth stage and berry veraison stage respectively grapevine growth status and seasonal air temperature change besides plant physiological factors and meteorological conditions plant transpiration depends on soil water availability wang et al 2021 our study demonstrated that the transpiration in im and il treatments were lower than in ih treatments for the most part fig 1 this result is mainly because deficit irrigation causes decline in stomatal conductance and transpiration rate kovalenko et al 2021 roccuzzo et al 2014 reported that deficit irrigated citrus trees reduced the transpiration rate by up to 60 compared with those full irrigated at the peak of water stress leaf chlorophyll concentration reflects plant nitrogen status and soil nitrogen availability taskos et al 2015 treder et al 2022 in our study spad readings varied with the grapevine growth or the sampling time which was probably related to continual chlorophyll synthesis 30 60 days after anthesis in 2021 in fig 2 and nitrogen translocation from aged leaves to younger organs 60 90 days after anthesis in 2020 in fig 2 taskos et al 2015 in addition overall the increments of fertilizer increased the spad readings fig 2 similar responses were previously presented in the study by brunetto et al 2012 and taskos et al 2015 4 2 effects of irrigation and fertilization on grape yield and berry quality in the present study irrigation levels had a significant effect on grape yield table 2 full irrigation prior to veraison may result in excessive shoot growth wample and smithyman 2002 while deficit irrigation before veraison could regulate shoot growth promote an accumulation of carbohydrates reserves and improve berry development conesa et al 2022 this may explain why im treatment increased the grape yield potential compared with ih treatment table 2 in our study when averaged across the years and fertilization rates il treatment decreased the grape yield by 9 4 compared with ih treatment table 2 this is similar to the study by pech et al 2008 who found sustained deficit irrigation with 50 of the water given to control vines reduced the grape yield by 9 31 the grape yield losses were partly due to the berry mass reduction which was caused by the inhibition of cell expansion and the diminution of inner mesocarp cell sap torres et al 2021 additionally severe deficit irrigation reportedly allocated more assimilate towards root reduced total leaf area decreased fruit load and then lowered grape yield niculcea et al 2015 romero et al 2016 adequate nitrogen is necessary for inflorescence primordium formation and flower differentiation baldi et al 2017 therefore nitrogen stress reduces bud fertility and berry number per bunch and then grape yield of the current and next season guilpart et al 2014 moreover nitrogen stress tends to affect photosynthesis due to lower ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco production as well as chlorophyll content which also decreases yield stefanello et al 2020b 2021 possibly for these facts fl treatment significantly decreased grape yield with the lowest yield among the three fertilizer treatments in our study table 2 furthermore our results showed that the difference in grape yield between fh treatment and fm treatment was not significant table 2 bell and henschke 2005 pointed out that further addition of nitrogen does not increase or even lowers the grape yield when the nitrogen status of vines is adequate because with the increasing nitrogen doses a transition of sink source ratio vegetative generative growth ratio will happen and more photosyntates remain in the leaves finally affecting berry yield lang et al 2018 the main objective of manipulating irrigation in vineyards is to improve berry quality previous literature showed that deficit irrigation increased soluble solids and soluble sugars acevedo opazo et al 2010 ju et al 2019 yang et al 2020 which is similar to our observation in 2019 and 2021 in spite of a smaller increase table s1 the increased sugar contents are likely caused by some up regulated sugar unloading genes and these up regulated genes will lead to an accumulation of glucose in the berries yang et al 2020 our study also demonstrated that deficit irrigation treatments decreased titratable acid table 2 in agreement with the studies by duan et al 2021 and santesteban et al 2011 this result could be attributed to the reduction of malic acid koundouras et al 2006 because deficit irrigation could lead to a decreased transpiration and then elevated canopy temperature which promotes the enzyme activity favorable for the malic acid degradation to glucose kizildeniz et al 2015 for the reason of increased sugars as well as decreased titratable acid sugar acid ratio was markedly increased under im and il treatments compared with ih treatment table 2 for total polyphenols anthocyanins and tannins some studies suggest that deficit irrigation increases their contents significantly duan et al 2021 ju et al 2019 lizama et al 2021 and two main mechanisms are involved an indirect effect dependent on the higher skin pulp ratio in smaller berries a concentration effect and a direct effect due to genetic and metabolic change ojeda et al 2002 poni et al 2018 however consistent with our results table 2 koundouras et al 2009 found that skin total polyphenols anthocyanins and tannins were not significantly affected by deficit irrigation with 50 of evapotranspiration demand compared with full irrigation different conclusions among these above mentioned studies may be due to the various vine genotypes intensity of water deficit and environmental conditions chaves et al 2007 no conclusive trend has emerged on how fertilizer affected berry quality in this study fertilization rates 51 68 and 85 kg n ha 1 had a significant effect only on anthocyanins and condensed tannins and did not affect other berry composition table 2 walker et al 2021 observed no significant differences among different nitrogen treatments 0 18 and 36 kg n ha 1 in total soluble solids titratable acid ph total polyphenols anthocyanins and tannins however wang et al 2016 found that at a certain irrigation amount total soluble solids was first increased and then decreased with the increase of fertilizer n p2o5 k2o indicating that there was a water and fertilizer threshold at which the best berry quality could be achieved thomidis et al 2016 reported that total polyphenols and anthocyanins were decreased in berries as nitrogen dose was increased 0 60 and 150 kg n ha 1 various fertilizer rates and or fertilizer application methods in different studies may account for the various phenomenon the mechanisms of how fertilizer affects the berry composition is not so clear as that of how water affects the berry quality hilbert et al 2003 reported that nitrogen directly affected the anthocyanin accumulation in berries which was independent of indirect effects related to carbon partitioning between vegetative and reproductive growth or berry size in the future more research is required to elucidate how fertilizer functions in determination of berry quality through genes and metabolites 4 3 effects of irrigation and fertilization on iwue wue and pfpf water use efficiency yield water applied should be taken into consideration in vineyard irrigation junquera et al 2012 especially in arid and semiarid regions where water is an increasingly scarce resource it is feasible to increase iwue and wue by means of deficit irrigation fereres and soriano 2007 medrano et al 2015 in our study compared with ih treatment vines in im treatment achieved a higher yield with less irrigation water and actual water consumption and for il treatment the decrease in yield 9 4 was much lower than the decreases in irrigation water 40 and actual water consumption 19 9 table 2 fig 3 therefore the iwue and wue in both im and il treatments were enhanced table 3 irrigation affects fertilizer use efficiency through altering nutrient availability and transportation in the soil as well as nutrient uptake by the root system zhang et al 2019 in our study pfpf was significantly affected by irrigation levels and im treatment presented the highest pfpf table 3 illustrating that pfpf could be regulated by irrigation and that im treatment is beneficial to improving pfpf compared with the other two treatments appropriate fertilizer application can promote root growth and canopy development of grapevines which allows more water to be absorbed under a constant irrigation rate facilitating water use processes and improving water use efficiency zhang et al 2019 this may explain our results that the iwue and wue were higher in fh and fm treatments than that in fl treatment table 3 averaged across the years and irrigation levels fm treatment did not decrease the yield whereas it increased pfpf by 25 4 fl treatment decreased the yield by 10 3 whereas it increased pfpf by 49 4 table 2 table 3 the results indicated that supplying fertilizer corresponding to 80 of the locally recommended amount is conducive to cost saving and enhancing pfpf without reducing the yield zhang et al 2019 reported that interaction effects between irrigation and fertilization were not significant on wue and pfpf in our study interaction effects between irrigation and fertilization were only significant on pfpf table 3 however li et al 2020 found that the interaction effects significantly affected both wue and pfpf these inconsistent results may be caused by the high variability within and between studies including the water and fertilizer rates grape genotypes and environmental conditions 4 4 the optimal irrigation and fertilization management irrigation and fertilization management should not only focus on maximizing yield but also better quality especially for wine grapes and higher agricultural resource use efficiency such as wue and pfpf in practice it is hard to achieve maximum grape yield quality and resource use efficiency at the same time liu et al 2021 as shown in this study for ihfm treatment in 2021 the greatest grape yield was produced but the berry quality wue and pfpf was not optimal table s1 therefore it is necessary to evaluate different irrigation and fertilization treatments based on grape yield berry quality wue and pfpf gra topsis and cem methods are widely used in multi objective comprehensive evaluation research li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 su et al 2021 wang et al 2015 gra is based on the similarity between each candidate network and the best reference network wang and rangaiah 2017 topsis requires the optimal solution to have the smallest euclidean distance from the positive ideal solution and the largest euclidean distance from the negative ideal solution liu et al 2021 cem is a combination of several evaluation methods li et al 2021 wang et al 2015 our results suggested that the three methods were all qualified to select the treatment balancing grape yield berry quality wue and pfpf although some differences existed in the final results using different methods in the three years imfm treatment was the greatest overall table 4 our study would provide a scientific benchmark for irrigation and fertilization management of wine grape under drip fertigation in north china and other regions with similar environmental conditions 5 conclusions deficit irrigation could improve berry quality through decreasing titratable acid and increasing sugar acid ratio imfm treatment 20 mm per irrigation event combined with 504 kg ha 1 yr 1 water soluble fertilizer was the optimal treatment which can balance the grape yield berry quality and water fertilizer use efficiency for wine grape these results in this study will possibly provide a theoretical basis for the management of fertigated wine grape in north china the mechanisms of how fertigation affects berry quality need to be further studied in

9022,drip fertigation is an advanced technology combining micro irrigation with fertilization which is conducive to deliver water and nutrients to crops or fruit trees synchronously to optimize drip fertigation scheduling for wine grape in north china a three year field experiment was conducted to study the effects of irrigation and fertilization quota on yield berry quality water use efficiency wue and partial factor productivity of fertilizer pfpf nine treatments were set up based on the combinations of three irrigation levels and three fertilization rates the three irrigation levels were 100 ih 80 im and 60 il of the designed irrigation quota i e 25 20 and 15 mm per irrigation event the three fertilization rates were 100 fh 80 fm and 60 fl of the compound water soluble fertilizer amount locally recommended i e 630 504 and 378 kg ha 1 yr 1 both irrigation and fertilization had a significant effect on yield irrigation also significantly affected titratable acid and sugar acid ratio averaged across the years and fertilization rates compared with ih treatment im treatment decreased titratable acid by 3 3 and increased sugar acid ratio by 12 2 il treatment decreased titratable acid by 10 7 and increased sugar acid ratio by 20 0 fm treatment presented the richest anthocyanins and condensed tannins among the three fertilizer rates iwue was significantly increased with the decrease of irrigation amounts wue and pfpf reached the maximum in im treatment the decrease of fertilizer rates significantly increased pfpf but was not beneficial for wue interaction effects between irrigation and fertilization were only significant on pfpf assessed by gray relational analysis gra technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and combinational evaluation method cem the combinational evaluation value qi of imfm treatment moderate water and fertilizer 20 mm per irrigation event combined with 504 kg ha 1 yr 1 compound water soluble fertilizer was the highest on the whole indicating that imfm treatment was the optimal treatment which could balance yield quality and water fertilizer use efficiency these results may provide

partial factor productivity of fertilizer comprehensive evaluation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wine grape vitis vinifera l is a perennial crop widely grown all over the world in recent years wine grape growing is expanding rapidly in china and most growing regions are located in the north and northwest china in the vicinity of 38 n liang et al 2014 however the limited water resource in these regions restricts the sustainable development of a wine grape industry additionally local farmers lack efficient field water and fertilizer management strategies which lower water and fertilizer use efficiency as well as result in waste of resources and pollution of water resource wang et al 2021a water is one of the most critical factors determining vineyard performance sebastian et al 2015 many scholars have reported the effects of irrigation on vine growth intrigliolo et al 2016 reported that compared with rainfed vines irrigation with 50 of the estimated evapotranspiration demand during post veraison could increase yield by 30 kyraleou et al 2016 showed that phenolic compounds in seed and skin were richer in full and deficit irrigated vines than those in non irrigated ones however excessive irrigation will be adverse for it causes vigorous vegetative growth and denser canopies which can not only increase canopy management practices but also influence berry exposure and thereby lower berry quality chaves et al 2007 dokoozlian and kliewer 1996 munitz et al 2017 conversely deficit irrigation if properly implemented is helpful to achieve a balance between vegetative and reproductive growth of vines maintain yield and improve berry quality chaves et al 2007 munitz et al 2017 such as increasing total soluble solids and reducing sugars polyphenols and anthocyanins basile et al 2011 ju et al 2019 yang et al 2020 in addition deficit irrigation also enhances water use efficiency significantly collins et al 2010 santos et al 2007 concluded that 50 of the crop evapotranspiration from fruit set to three weeks before harvest was sufficient to maintain the moscatel yield potential with doubled water use efficiency fertilizer is also an important factor affecting the yield and quality of wine grapes in some vineyards with sandy soils it is imperative to supply mineral nitrogen at optimal rates to guarantee the vine yield due to limited organic matter and low nitrogen availability brunetto et al 2016 stefanello et al 2020a nitrogen requirements of vines are commonly about 40 80 kg ha 1 a 1 lang et al 2018 excessive nitrogen induces redundant vegetative growth and unbalanced sink source ratio affecting sugar translocation and thus decreasing anthocyanin accumulation which results in poorly colored berries lang et al 2018 stefanello et al 2021 effects of phosphorous and potassium on wine grapes were also reported schreiner et al 2013 found that low phosphorous and low potassium supply did not alter vine growth or yield davies et al 2004 reported that excessive potassium decreased the free acid and led to a ph increase in berries however ciotta et al 2021 reported that potassium application did not have effects on must composition including total soluble solids ph and total titratable acidity previous studies have focused largely on the effects of single irrigation and fertilization on yield and quality of wine grape studies on the influences of water and fertilizer coupling are still scarce however irrigation and fertilizer need to be managed synchronously in practical farming drip fertigation is an advanced technology combining micro irrigation with fertilization which can directly deliver water and nutrients to crop roots li et al 2021 this technology provides convenience for studying the effects of water and fertilizer coupling recently walker et al 2021 reported the influences of water and fertilizer treatments on vine vegetative growth yield and grape composition through drip fertigation showing that the effects were marginal inconsistent and largely affected by climatic conditions for wine grape cultivation multi objective optimization of yield berry quality and environmental benefits is essential therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify the coupling effects of different irrigation and fertilization amounts on yield berry quality water use efficiency wue and partial factor productivity of fertilizer pfpf 2 to develop an optimal irrigation and fertilization management strategy based on a multi criteria optimization using different evaluation methods such as gray relational analysis gra technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and combinational evaluation method cem 2

respectively 3 results 3 1 meteorological data the meteorological data during the three growth seasons are displayed in fig s4 the average solar radiation from budbreak to harvest was 237 95 w m 2 222 43 w m 2 and 210 87 w m 2 in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the hottest year was 2019 among three years and its accumulated value of growing degree days gdd from budbreak to harvest was 129 3 c and 161 1 c higher than that in 2020 and 2021 respectively precipitation showed ample fluctuations from budbreak to harvest ranging from a minimum of 235 6 mm in 2021 to a maximum of 406 0 mm in 2020 3 2 effects of irrigation on transpiration and effects of fertilization on spad when averaged across the fertilization rates the total transpiration during the whole growth stage was in the range of 231 77 279 06 mm 195 46 245 53 mm and 154 80 223 86 mm in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the proportions of transpiration at different stages were different 34 2 41 7 for berry growth stage 33 1 39 5 for berry veraison stage 13 4 20 9 for shoot growth stage and only 5 0 11 8 for anthesis stage overall there was a tendency that transpiration was higher in ih treatment than that in im and il treatments fig 1 compared with ih treatment im treatment decreased total transpiration by 20 7 at berry veraison stage in 2019 il treatment decreased total transpiration by 27 4 at berry veraison stage in 2019 39 6 at shoot growth stage in 2020 as well as 57 3 30 9 and 28 4 at anthesis stage berry growth stage and berry veraison stage in 2021 respectively showing significant differences from ih treatment fig 1 when averaged across the irrigation levels on each date in 2020 and 2021 spad values were always decreased as the fertilization amounts were reduced at 30 and 60 days after anthesis in 2020 as well as 60 and 90 days after anthesis in 2021 significant differences were found among different fertilization treatments fig 2 3 3 effects of irrigation and fertilization on grape yield and berry quality effects of irrigation and fertilization on yield and quality of wine grape are shown in table 2 grape yield was significantly affected by years and ranged from 8765 to 9793 kg ha 1 across the different years both irrigation levels and fertilization rates had a significant effect on grape yield averaged across the years and fertilization rates compared with ih treatment im treatment increased the yield by 6 0 and il treatment decreased the yield by 9 4 averaged across the years and irrigation levels compared with fh treatment fm treatment did not significantly affect the yield but fl treatment decreased the yield by 10 3 table 2 years significantly affected all berry quality parameters irrigation levels significantly affected titratable acid and sugar acid ranging from 0 574 to 0 643 and from 24 78 to 29 73 across the different irrigation levels respectively averaged across the years and fertilization rates compared with ih treatment im and il treatments decreased titratable acid by 3 3 and 10 7 respectively im and il treatments increased sugar acid ratio by 12 2 and 20 0 respectively for soluble sugars total polyphenols anthocyanins and condensed tannins no significant differences were observed among irrigation levels fertilization rates had a significant effect only on anthocyanins and condensed tannins averaged across the years and irrigation levels fm treatment presented the highest anthocyanins 4 66 mg g 1 and condensed tannins 3 19 mg g 1 compared with fh and fl treatments while the differences between fh treatment and fl treatment were not significant the interaction effects between irrigation and fertilization did not significantly affect yield and berry quality table 2 3 4 effects of irrigation and fertilization on et iwue wue and pfpf et was analyzed by averaging the data of different fertilizer treatments within each irrigation treatment im and il treatments significantly decreased et compared with ih treatment during the three seasons with a decrease of 10 2 15 4 and 17 1 27 9 respectively fig 3 years had a significant effect on iwue and wue but not on pfpf iwue ranged from 4 88 to 6 46 kg m 3 across the different years and the maximum value was found in 2020 wue showed a small variation in the range of 2 23 2 50 kg m 3 from year to year and the greatest value was observed in 2021 table 3 irrigation levels had a significant effect on iwue and wue averaged across the years and fertilization rates compared with ih treatment im treatment increased the iwue and wue by 33 1 and 20 5 respectively il treatment increased the iwue and wue by 50 3 and 13 8 respectively table 3 irrigation levels also significantly affected pfpf compared with ih treatment im treatment increased the pfpf by 7 0 while il treatment decreased the pfpf by 9 0 table 3 the effects of fertilization rates were significant on iwue but not on wue compared with fh treatment fm treatment hardly affected the iwue and fl treatment decreased the iwue by 10 3 table 3 fertilization rates significantly increased pfpf up to 22 86 kg kg 1 with the decreasing fertilization rates averaged across the years and irrigation levels compared with fh treatment fm and fl treatments increased the pfpf by 25 4 and 49 4 respectively table 3 the interaction between irrigation levels and fertilization rates did not significantly affect iwue and wue but had a significant effect on pfpf table 3 pfpf lay in the range of 13 75 27 53 13 52 24 86 and 15 10 24 37 kg kg 1 in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the highest pfpf was always observed in imfl treatment while the lowest was always found in ilfh treatment in the three years table s1 3 5 comprehensive evaluation of different treatments with gra topsis and cem the weight of each evaluation parameter was calculated through ahp table s2 gra topsis and cem were used to identify the optimal treatment and the results are shown in table 4 in the case of cem in 2019 2020 and 2021 the top three treatments were imfm ilfm imfh imfm imfh imfl and imfh ihfm imfm respectively when averaged across the three years the top three treatments were imfm imfh ihfm overall imfm treatment was the best treatment which can best balance the yield berry quality wue and pfpf but ihfh was the poorest treatment 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation on transpiration and effects of fertilization on spad the transpiration showed a clear stage pattern in each of the three years the total transpiration during berry growth stage was the largest followed by berry veraison stage and then shoot growing stage and finally anthesis stage fig 1 this trend can be explained by duration of each stage about 35 15 55 and 55 days for shoot growth stage anthesis stage berry growth stage and berry veraison stage respectively grapevine growth status and seasonal air temperature change besides plant physiological factors and meteorological conditions plant transpiration depends on soil water availability wang et al 2021 our study demonstrated that the transpiration in im and il treatments were lower than in ih treatments for the most part fig 1 this result is mainly because deficit irrigation causes decline in stomatal conductance and transpiration rate kovalenko et al 2021 roccuzzo et al 2014 reported that deficit irrigated citrus trees reduced the transpiration rate by up to 60 compared with those full irrigated at the peak of water stress leaf chlorophyll concentration reflects plant nitrogen status and soil nitrogen availability taskos et al 2015 treder et al 2022 in our study spad readings varied with the grapevine growth or the sampling time which was probably related to continual chlorophyll synthesis 30 60 days after anthesis in 2021 in fig 2 and nitrogen translocation from aged leaves to younger organs 60 90 days after anthesis in 2020 in fig 2 taskos et al 2015 in addition overall the increments of fertilizer increased the spad readings fig 2 similar responses were previously presented in the study by brunetto et al 2012 and taskos et al 2015 4 2 effects of irrigation and fertilization on grape yield and berry quality in the present study irrigation levels had a significant effect on grape yield table 2 full irrigation prior to veraison may result in excessive shoot growth wample and smithyman 2002 while deficit irrigation before veraison could regulate shoot growth promote an accumulation of carbohydrates reserves and improve berry development conesa et al 2022 this may explain why im treatment increased the grape yield potential compared with ih treatment table 2 in our study when averaged across the years and fertilization rates il treatment decreased the grape yield by 9 4 compared with ih treatment table 2 this is similar to the study by pech et al 2008 who found sustained deficit irrigation with 50 of the water given to control vines reduced the grape yield by 9 31 the grape yield losses were partly due to the berry mass reduction which was caused by the inhibition of cell expansion and the diminution of inner mesocarp cell sap torres et al 2021 additionally severe deficit irrigation reportedly allocated more assimilate towards root reduced total leaf area decreased fruit load and then lowered grape yield niculcea et al 2015 romero et al 2016 adequate nitrogen is necessary for inflorescence primordium formation and flower differentiation baldi et al 2017 therefore nitrogen stress reduces bud fertility and berry number per bunch and then grape yield of the current and next season guilpart et al 2014 moreover nitrogen stress tends to affect photosynthesis due to lower ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco production as well as chlorophyll content which also decreases yield stefanello et al 2020b 2021 possibly for these facts fl treatment significantly decreased grape yield with the lowest yield among the three fertilizer treatments in our study table 2 furthermore our results showed that the difference in grape yield between fh treatment and fm treatment was not significant table 2 bell and henschke 2005 pointed out that further addition of nitrogen does not increase or even lowers the grape yield when the nitrogen status of vines is adequate because with the increasing nitrogen doses a transition of sink source ratio vegetative generative growth ratio will happen and more photosyntates remain in the leaves finally affecting berry yield lang et al 2018 the main objective of manipulating irrigation in vineyards is to improve berry quality previous literature showed that deficit irrigation increased soluble solids and soluble sugars acevedo opazo et al 2010 ju et al 2019 yang et al 2020 which is similar to our observation in 2019 and 2021 in spite of a smaller increase table s1 the increased sugar contents are likely caused by some up regulated sugar unloading genes and these up regulated genes will lead to an accumulation of glucose in the berries yang et al 2020 our study also demonstrated that deficit irrigation treatments decreased titratable acid table 2 in agreement with the studies by duan et al 2021 and santesteban et al 2011 this result could be attributed to the reduction of malic acid koundouras et al 2006 because deficit irrigation could lead to a decreased transpiration and then elevated canopy temperature which promotes the enzyme activity favorable for the malic acid degradation to glucose kizildeniz et al 2015 for the reason of increased sugars as well as decreased titratable acid sugar acid ratio was markedly increased under im and il treatments compared with ih treatment table 2 for total polyphenols anthocyanins and tannins some studies suggest that deficit irrigation increases their contents significantly duan et al 2021 ju et al 2019 lizama et al 2021 and two main mechanisms are involved an indirect effect dependent on the higher skin pulp ratio in smaller berries a concentration effect and a direct effect due to genetic and metabolic change ojeda et al 2002 poni et al 2018 however consistent with our results table 2 koundouras et al 2009 found that skin total polyphenols anthocyanins and tannins were not significantly affected by deficit irrigation with 50 of evapotranspiration demand compared with full irrigation different conclusions among these above mentioned studies may be due to the various vine genotypes intensity of water deficit and environmental conditions chaves et al 2007 no conclusive trend has emerged on how fertilizer affected berry quality in this study fertilization rates 51 68 and 85 kg n ha 1 had a significant effect only on anthocyanins and condensed tannins and did not affect other berry composition table 2 walker et al 2021 observed no significant differences among different nitrogen treatments 0 18 and 36 kg n ha 1 in total soluble solids titratable acid ph total polyphenols anthocyanins and tannins however wang et al 2016 found that at a certain irrigation amount total soluble solids was first increased and then decreased with the increase of fertilizer n p2o5 k2o indicating that there was a water and fertilizer threshold at which the best berry quality could be achieved thomidis et al 2016 reported that total polyphenols and anthocyanins were decreased in berries as nitrogen dose was increased 0 60 and 150 kg n ha 1 various fertilizer rates and or fertilizer application methods in different studies may account for the various phenomenon the mechanisms of how fertilizer affects the berry composition is not so clear as that of how water affects the berry quality hilbert et al 2003 reported that nitrogen directly affected the anthocyanin accumulation in berries which was independent of indirect effects related to carbon partitioning between vegetative and reproductive growth or berry size in the future more research is required to elucidate how fertilizer functions in determination of berry quality through genes and metabolites 4 3 effects of irrigation and fertilization on iwue wue and pfpf water use efficiency yield water applied should be taken into consideration in vineyard irrigation junquera et al 2012 especially in arid and semiarid regions where water is an increasingly scarce resource it is feasible to increase iwue and wue by means of deficit irrigation fereres and soriano 2007 medrano et al 2015 in our study compared with ih treatment vines in im treatment achieved a higher yield with less irrigation water and actual water consumption and for il treatment the decrease in yield 9 4 was much lower than the decreases in irrigation water 40 and actual water consumption 19 9 table 2 fig 3 therefore the iwue and wue in both im and il treatments were enhanced table 3 irrigation affects fertilizer use efficiency through altering nutrient availability and transportation in the soil as well as nutrient uptake by the root system zhang et al 2019 in our study pfpf was significantly affected by irrigation levels and im treatment presented the highest pfpf table 3 illustrating that pfpf could be regulated by irrigation and that im treatment is beneficial to improving pfpf compared with the other two treatments appropriate fertilizer application can promote root growth and canopy development of grapevines which allows more water to be absorbed under a constant irrigation rate facilitating water use processes and improving water use efficiency zhang et al 2019 this may explain our results that the iwue and wue were higher in fh and fm treatments than that in fl treatment table 3 averaged across the years and irrigation levels fm treatment did not decrease the yield whereas it increased pfpf by 25 4 fl treatment decreased the yield by 10 3 whereas it increased pfpf by 49 4 table 2 table 3 the results indicated that supplying fertilizer corresponding to 80 of the locally recommended amount is conducive to cost saving and enhancing pfpf without reducing the yield zhang et al 2019 reported that interaction effects between irrigation and fertilization were not significant on wue and pfpf in our study interaction effects between irrigation and fertilization were only significant on pfpf table 3 however li et al 2020 found that the interaction effects significantly affected both wue and pfpf these inconsistent results may be caused by the high variability within and between studies including the water and fertilizer rates grape genotypes and environmental conditions 4 4 the optimal irrigation and fertilization management irrigation and fertilization management should not only focus on maximizing yield but also better quality especially for wine grapes and higher agricultural resource use efficiency such as wue and pfpf in practice it is hard to achieve maximum grape yield quality and resource use efficiency at the same time liu et al 2021 as shown in this study for ihfm treatment in 2021 the greatest grape yield was produced but the berry quality wue and pfpf was not optimal table s1 therefore it is necessary to evaluate different irrigation and fertilization treatments based on grape yield berry quality wue and pfpf gra topsis and cem methods are widely used in multi objective comprehensive evaluation research li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 su et al 2021 wang et al 2015 gra is based on the similarity between each candidate network and the best reference network wang and rangaiah 2017 topsis requires the optimal solution to have the smallest euclidean distance from the positive ideal solution and the largest euclidean distance from the negative ideal solution liu et al 2021 cem is a combination of several evaluation methods li et al 2021 wang et al 2015 our results suggested that the three methods were all qualified to select the treatment balancing grape yield berry quality wue and pfpf although some differences existed in the final results using different methods in the three years imfm treatment was the greatest overall table 4 our study would provide a scientific benchmark for irrigation and fertilization management of wine grape under drip fertigation in north china and other regions with similar environmental conditions 5 conclusions deficit irrigation could improve berry quality through decreasing titratable acid and increasing sugar acid ratio imfm treatment 20 mm per irrigation event combined with 504 kg ha 1 yr 1 water soluble fertilizer was the optimal treatment which can balance the grape yield berry quality and water fertilizer use efficiency for wine grape these results in this study will possibly provide a theoretical basis for the management of fertigated wine grape in north china the mechanisms of how fertigation affects berry quality need to be further studied in

results showed that the most frequent and long lasting drought occurred during the summer maize sowing jointing stage on huang huai hai plain in the 1960 s and the entire plain was basically in a drought prone area in the last 61a drought occurred less frequently was short lived throughout the reproductive stage during jointing flowering and was concentrated in the light drought zone drought frequency in the flowering maturation stage was highest during the entire growth period and drought frequency displayed a high low high three stage distribution from south to north mainly in drought prone and extremely drought prone areas the drought barycenter during the sowing jointing stage showed an east west distribution pattern and moved eastward from 1970 to 2000 displaying a south north distribution pattern during jointing flowering and flowering maturation stages drought conditions at the sowing jointing and flowering maturation stages of summer maize displayed positive correlation with the occurrence of el niño southern oscillation enso warm events and the flowering maturation stage displayed a negative correlation with the occurrence of enso cold events oceanic nino index oni

barycenter summer maize growing period data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years global climate anomalies and a continuous increase in surface temperature have led to frequent droughts heavy rains and floods han et al 2021 shi et al 2021 which are widely distributed and heavily affected further aggravating the imbalance in the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources han 2005 this imbalance not only affects industrial and agricultural production but also threatens human life health and property security which has caused widespread concern worldwide grayson 2013 shiru et al 2020 the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar6 predicts an accelerated rate of global warming and states that global temperature increases are expected to reach or exceed 1 5 c under this scenario further changes in the global water cycle in the future will result in stronger precipitation floods and more severe droughts zhou et al 2021 as a meteorological disaster with high frequency long duration and wide impact drought has caused serious impact on economic and social development worldwide particularly on agricultural production guan et al 2018 since the mid 1950 s north africa alaska canada and much of eurasia have experienced widespread drought dai et al 2004 spinoni et al 2014 dai 2011 showed that from 1950 to 2008 global average annual growth rate of areas experiencing drought was approximately 1 74 as a traditionally agricultural country china has been affected by climate change and drought has become increasingly severe since the 1990 s severe and extreme droughts are frequent and the drought area continues to increase by approximately 3 72 every 10 years yu et al 2014 drought indicators are the basis for carrying out drought monitoring and risk assessments as well as an effective tool for studying the evolutionary characteristics of drought the palmer drought severity index pdsi based on soil water balance theory is one of the most widely used drought indices worldwide which effectively solves regional drought monitoring and forecasting problems however it is influenced by the calibration period limitation of spatial comparability and subjectivity of the drought class definition guttman et al 1992 yan et al 2009 in response to the problems of the pdsi mckee et al 1993 proposed the standardized precipitation index spi which is based on probability distribution of precipitation with multiple time scales therefore the spi was soon developed and widely accepted in drought research however only the precipitation variation was considered in the spi calculations and the role of temperature was neglected in 2010 vicente serrano et al 2012 developed a new standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which is based on the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration the spei not only considers the influence of temperature on drought severity but also retains the multi scale and multi spatial features in the spi which is applicable to the analysis of drought characteristics in the context of global warming different evapotranspiration formulae have different physical meanings and consider different meteorological elements therefore the calculated spei will produce differences potential evaporative emission pet based on the thornthwaite th equation requires only temperature data is simple to calculate and is widely used luo et al 2016 liu et al 2021 however the thornthwaite method is only applicable for calculating the pet in wet areas in arid and semi arid areas pet will be underestimated and less able to assess drought because it is not only determined by ambient temperature pet calculations should include correct physical calculations to account for radiation and aerodynamic effects guo et al 2019 therefore many experts and scholars recommend using the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao penman monteith pm method to calculate pet the method is a more realistic calculation that considers the variability of available energy humidity and wind speed zhao et al 2015 and is more physically comprehensive the spei calculated based on this method can better estimate true global drought trends chen and sun 2015 huang huai hai plain is an important summer maize production base in china zhou 2018 and the summer maize cultivation area accounts for approximately one third of the country maize is a mild and high water consuming crop and the entire reproductive process requires higher meteorological conditions such as temperature and precipitation wang 2018 cao et al 2020 the occurrence of drought is bound to have an impact on growth and development which in turn may affect corn yields and cause agricultural and economic losses at present many scholars have used the larger timescale spei pm to characterize drought such as using the monthly scale drought indicators that are less sensitive to short term drought occurring during crop growth and development period ming et al 2015 potopová et al 2015 li et al 2017 however droughts occur at irregular times and are difficult to identify accurately on a purely monthly scale for short periods of intense drought based on monthly scale monitoring it is possible to go from no drought to exceptional drought in one month which is not consistent with the process of drought occurrence in order to accurately identify short lived droughts that occur during crop growth and development we should use smaller time scale drought indicators for monitoring and analysis to better reveal drought characteristics during crop growth and development therefore to address the problem of short and high intensity droughts occurring during the summer maize growing period we used the daily scale spei pm to quantitatively identify the drought conditions during the summer maize growing period on the huang huai hai plain the aim is to provide a scientific and theoretical basis for the production and drought prevention and mitigation of summer maize on the huang huai hai plain from the perspective of key fertility stages 2 overview of study area huang huai hai plain 31 43 n 110 123 e is located south of yanshan mountain and north of huaihe river and includes beijing tianjin hebei province shandong province henan province jiangsu province and anhui province it covers an area of approximately 330 000 km2 a vast area with low and flat terrain and complex topography chen et al 2020 most of which is less than 50 m above sea level the eastern coastal plain is less than 10 m above sea level and is a typical alluvial plain hao et al 2010 huang huai hai plain has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate it has a hot and rainy season with 2800 h of sunshine per year natural conditions are extremely favorable for growth and development of maize and it is the largest summer maize planting area in china wu et al 2019 huang huai hai plain is one of the most water scarce regions in china with an annual precipitation of 500 800 mm showing a distribution pattern greater in the south than the north annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 1000 mm and most regions are in a state of precipitation deficit making it one of the most drought stricken areas in china zhou and zhang

summer maize growing period into three stages sowing jointing jointing flowering and flowering maturation stages liu 2002 average multi year fertility of summer maize on huang huai hai plain is shown in table 1 3 3 research methodology 3 3 1 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spei was obtained by calculating the difference between daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and conducting normal standardization the first step was to calculate daily potential evapotranspiration this study adopted the pm model recommended by the fao zhao et al 2015 1 p e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where pet 0 is potential evapotranspiration mm d 1 r n is net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 t is average daily temperature c u 2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 e s is saturation water vapor pressure kpa e a is actual water vapor pressure kpa δ is slope of the saturation water vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 and γ is the dry and wet table constant the second step was to calculate the difference between daily precipitation and evapotranspiration 2 d i p i p e t i where d i is the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration p i is daily precipitation and pet i is daily potential evapotranspiration in the third step the data series d i was fitted and best fit was achieved by using a three parameter log logistic probability distribution function 3 f x β α x γ α β 1 1 x γ α β 2 in the formula the parameters α and γ can be obtained using the linear moment l

obtained as 5 f x 1 α x γ β 1 in the fourth step the cumulative probability density was normalized 6 s p e i w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 w 2 i n p where when p 0 5 p f x when and p 1 f

shown in table 2 based on the meteorological drought rating issued by the national climate center gb t 20481 2017 the spei of different timescales reflects availability of different water sources and soil moisture is more sensitive to the short timescale spei therefore this study used daily scale spei to study drought trends of summer maize growing period on huang huai hai plain 3 3 2 quantitative characterization of drought 1 drought duration when the spei is less than or equal to 0 5 for 10 consecutive days then a drought process is determined to have occurred the start of the drought process is the first day of the 10 consecutive days during the onset of drought the drought lifts when the spei is greater than 0 5 for 10 consecutive days and the drought process ends the end date is the day before the first day of the 10 days the time from the beginning to the end of the drought process is drought duration 2 drought intensity drought intensity is the sum of the spei of all days within the drought process for drought levels above mild drought and a larger value indicates a stronger drought process 3 drought frequency df drought frequency is the ratio of the number of drought years to the total number of years in a particular development stage of summer maize at a particular site during the study period 7 d f n n 100 where n is the number of years in which drought occurred at a particular developmental stage of summer maize at a site during the study period and n is the total number of years in the study period the greater the df value the more frequent the drought 4 drought barycenter drought barycenter was expressed as the position longitude latitude and time of the drought event in three dimensional space time domain and drought barycenter in this study was calculated as follows 8 x t i 1 n a t i b t i x i i 1 n a t i b t i y t i 1 n a t i b t i y i i 1 n a t i b t i where x t and y t are longitude and latitude coordinates of the regional drought gravity center in period t respectively x i and y i are longitude and latitude coordinates of the ith meteorological station respectively a t i is drought frequency at meteorological station i during period t b t i is drought intensity of meteorological station i in period t and n is total number of meteorological stations in the region 3 3 3 pearson correlation coefficient the pearson correlation coefficient can quantitatively describe the degree of correlation between climate factors and drought indices liu et al 2022 assuming that there are n data points for a i b i i 1 2 n the specific formula is as follows 8 r i 1 n a i a b i b i 1 n a i a 2 i 1 n b i b 2 where r is a real number between 1 1 when r is between 0 8 r 1 0 5 r 0 8 0 3 r 0 5 0 1 r 0 3 0 r 0 1 it indicates that the two are strongly highly moderately and weakly correlated respectively wu 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 frequency of droughts 4 1 1 time varying characteristics drought levels were assessed according to the spei and the frequency of drought at different fertility stages at each site on huang huai hai plain at 10 years intervals from 1960 to 2020 was counted fig 2 from fig 2 it can be seen that the most frequent droughts during different fertility stages of summer maize occurred during flowering maturation stage followed by sowing jointing stage and the least frequent droughts occurred during the jointing flowering stage which was approximately half of the flowering maturation stage in terms of drought occurrence time the most frequent and severe droughts occurred in the 1960 s during the sowing jointing stage with 127 severe and more severe droughts occurring much greater than the total number of severe and more severe droughts occurring during the latter 51a compared to the 2000 s the frequency of drought in the last 10a sowing jointing stage showed a significant increase the frequency of drought during the summer maize reproductive and jointing flowering stages was low the most frequent droughts occurred from 2010 to 2020 including 25 severe and more severe droughts and the least frequent droughts occurred in the 1970 s including 15 severe droughts with no extreme droughts the frequency of drought occurred most frequently during the flowering maturation stage frequency of drought occurring in the last six interdecadal periods did not vary much and was stable in contrast to the jointing flowering stage the most frequent droughts occurred in the 1970 s during the flowering maturation stage including 35 severe and more severe droughts and frequency of droughts occurring in the flowering maturation stage in the last 10a showed an increase in terms of the occurrence of drought types moderate drought was the most frequent in the entire reproductive stage of summer maize followed by mild drought both of which accounted for approximately 90 of overall drought frequency while the least was extreme drought which occurred 81 times mainly in the 1960 s and 1970 s during the sowing jointing stage the 1990 s during jointing flowering stage and the 1960 s during flowering maturation stage 4 1 2 spatial distribution characteristics according to the drought frequency of each station on huang huai hai plain using the kriging method to interpolate the spatial distribution of drought frequency during summer maize growing period fig 3 the natural grading method was used to classify drought frequency from low to high specifically low drought less than 20 light drought 20 30 general drought 30 40 moderate drought 40 50 severe drought more than 50 regions low drought areas less than 20 light drought 20 30 normal drought 30 40 easy drought 40 50 and very easy drought areas greater than 50 as shown in fig 3 frequency of drought during sowing jointing stage ranged from 32 8 to 52 5 with a mean value of 41 5 drought frequency after interpolation ranged from 39 2 to 46 2 with little regional variation and was drought prone overall with the southwestern part of agricultural zone iv being more drought prone during the sowing jointing stage frequency of drought occurrence during the jointing flowering stage was generally small ranging from 19 7 to 36 1 with a mean value of 28 5 and large regional differences with the greatest frequency of drought occurring in baodi bd 1 and the least frequency of drought occurring in liaocheng lc interpolated drought frequency ranged from 23 4 to 36 1 and from the spatial distribution there was an overall patchy distribution with high north and low south values the general drought area was concentrated in the local areas of agricultural zones i and ii in the eastern part of huang huai hai plain including baodi bd 1 leting lt jinghai jh 1 baoding bd 2 cangzhou cz 1 and jizhou jz while other areas were generally light drought areas frequency of drought during flowering maturation stage was generally higher and interpolated drought frequency was between 47 6 and 60 6 from the spatial distribution the difference in regional drought frequency was more obvious and overall distribution was high low high from south to north mainly in drought prone and extremely drought prone areas and the drought situation was more severe drought prone areas were concentrated in the central part of huang huai hai plain including yucheng yc jiyang jy and binzhou bz 2 in agricultural zone iii luohe lh yushi ws and puyang py 1 in agricultural zone iv and shouguang sg zibo zb and ningyang ny in agricultural zone v the other areas were generally very drought prone 4 2 drought duration to analyze the drought ephemeris of three fertility stages of summer maize at typical stations on huang huai hai plain in the last 61a the heatmap from matlab was used to draw the drought ephemeris distribution of summer maize growing period from 1960 to 2020 fig 4 duration of drought during the sowing jointing stage ranged from 0 to 38d and was mainly concentrated between 25 and 35d prolonged and persistent drought processes were mainly concentrated in the 1960 s except for the 1960 s almost all stations experienced prolonged and persistent droughts in 1974 1992 1997 and 2019 indicating that the entire huang huai hai plain may have been influenced by large scale weather systems during these years resulting in its extensive drought in terms of agricultural zoning droughts lasting more than 35d during the sowing jointing stage were mainly concentrated in zones iii and v cangzhou cz 1 in zone ii and binzhou bz 2 puyang py 1 jiyang jy and daming dm in zone iii they had a longer duration and higher frequency of droughts during the study period in the past three years only zones i ii and v of the six agricultural zones on huang huai hai plain had a long duration of drought whereas the remaining three agricultural zones had a short duration of drought or no drought duration of drought during the jointing flowering stage ranged from 0 to 24d and was mainly concentrated between 15 and 20d in terms of time the jointing flowering stage drought episodes were more scattered without more concentrated periods and the duration of the drought was also short but almost all sites in the two years 2014 and 2019 experienced a prolonged and sustained drought in terms of agricultural zoning droughts lasting more than 20d during the jointing flowering stage were mainly concentrated in zones i ii and vi with the highest concentration in zone ii which also corresponds to the high frequency of droughts in agricultural zone ii during the jointing flowering stage in the previous section baodi bd 1 beichen bc bazhou bz 1 and texas dz in zone ii experienced drought events of more than 20d during the study period duration of drought during the flowering maturation stage ranged from 0 to 48d and was mainly concentrated between 20 and 30d in terms of time the long duration drought process was mainly concentrated in zones i ii and iii from 1997 to 2002 and the duration of drought at each site was shorter in 2020 from the viewpoint of agricultural sub districts the overall ephemeral distribution of drought in each sub district was relatively scattered and the duration of drought within the flowering maturation stage exceeded 40d mainly in zones i and ii baodi bd 1 jinghai jh 1 bazhou bz 1 and xian counties xx 1 in zone ii had longer drought duration and higher frequency during the study period 4 3 drought barycenter based on the drought epochs and intensity at different fertility stages of summer maize on huang huai hai plain from 1960 to 2020 the center of gravity model was used to calculate the drought barycenter and its migration trajectory for the last six epochs of summer maize growing period fig 5 the migration direction and distance of each epoch relative to the previous epoch were also determined table 3 from fig 5 it can be seen that the drought barycenter during the sowing jointing stage had an east west distribution pattern mainly located between 35 30 n 36 00 n and 115 55 e 117 45 e in the eastward position of the center of huang huai hai plain in terms of migration direction the drought barycenter migrated in the northeast southeast southeast and northeast during the sowing jointing stage in the 1970 s 1980 s 1990 s and the 2000 s respectively the drought barycenter generally migrated eastward during these five years drought barycenter in 2010 2020 was 65 43 km to the northwest and in the west was about the same longitude as that of the 1990 s from the previous section it can be seen that the drought duration of the recent 61a sowing jointing stage showed a spatial distribution with a significantly decreasing trend in the eastern region and a non significant decreasing trend in the western region which may have led to the eastward migration trend of the drought barycenter in terms of migration distance the drought barycenter in the 2000 s sowing jointing stage shifted the most than the other five eras at 78 95 km indicating that the sowing jointing stage displayed a large difference in the degree of drought in the east and west of this era the smallest drought barycenter migration distance was only 36 63 km during the sowing jointing stage in the 1970 s indicating that the difference in drought degree between the eastern and western regions during the sowing jointing stage in the 1970 s was small compared with the sowing jointing stage the drought barycenter in the jointing flowering stage was generally distributed in a south north pattern mainly located between approximately 34 20 n 37 30 n and 116 10 e 117 10 e which is located to the east of the center of huang huai hai plain spanning agricultural zones iii iv and v in terms of migration direction the drought barycenter during the last six eras of the jointing flowering stage showed an overall south north alternating migration trend with high volatility from the previous section it can be seen that although the drought duration of the recent 61a jointing flowering stage were basically stable the base of the drought epoch and intensity were small and percentage change was large the jointing flowering stage showed a spatial distribution of tighter overall drought conditions in the northern region and slower overall drought conditions in the southern region which may have led to a general south north alternating migration trend of its drought barycenter in terms of migration distance the migration span of each chronological period of the jointing flowering stage was the largest among the three reproductive stages and the drought barycenter in the 1980 s jointing flowering stage was the largest than the other five chronological periods at 292 27 km and difference in the degree of drought in the northern and southern regions was greater at this time the distance of drought barycenter migration was the smallest in the 1990 s during the jointing flowering stage at 129 67 km and the difference in drought degree in the northern and southern regions was relatively small similar to the jointing flowering stage the drought barycenter in the flowering maturation stage also showed a south north distribution pattern but the north south span was relatively small in terms of migration direction except for the 1990 s when the drought barycenter of the flowering maturation stage drought tended to shift westward the drought barycenter of the flowering maturation stage drought in the rest of the years showed an alternating south north migration trend in general however fluctuations were relatively small the aforementioned migration of the drought barycenter during flowering maturation stage was more related to the monsoon circulation huang huai hai plain is located at the edge of the monsoonal climate zone precipitation during the sowing jointing stage is not only affected by the east asian summer monsoon but also by the mid high latitude circulation to a great extent precipitation is generally lower in the north and higher in the south simultaneously it can be seen from the previous section that drought duration in the flowering maturation stage in the past 61 years also showed a spatial distribution in which the overall drought in the northern region became more severe and overall drought in the southern region decreased the migration distance of the drought barycenter in the flowering maturation stage was the largest in the past 10 years and it migrated 149 16 km to the southwest during this time the degrees of drought in the northern and southern regions were quite different the distance of drought barycenter migration during the flowering maturation stage in the 1970 s was the smallest only 46 08 km and the difference in the degrees of drought in the northern and southern regions was relatively small overall the drought barycenter in the three fertility stages of summer maize exhibited a similar migration direction northeast in the 2000 s whereas the drought barycenter in the three fertility stages of summer maize generally exhibited a southward and westward migration trend in the 1990 s and from 2010 to 2020 overall the drought barycenter of the three growth stages of summer maize exhibited a similar migration direction northeast in the 2000 s whereas in the 1990 s and 2010 2020 the drought barycenter in the three growth stages of summer maize generally exhibited a southward and westward migration trend 4 4 teleconnection of climate change and drought characteristics 4 4 1 teleconnection of el niño southern oscillation enso cold and warm events with drought based on the spei at different fertility stages of summer maize on huang huai hai plain from 1960 to 2020 the spei of each fertility stage was correlated with enso cold and warm events and the relationship between spei and enso cold and warm events during summer maize growing period was analyzed as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 during the sowing jointing stage a total of nine drought conditions of different degrees occurred on huang huai hai plain in the last 61a among which warm events in the current or previous year occurred in six drought periods and there was a large positive correlation between the occurrence of warm events and drought conditions in the past 61 years 12 cold events occurred during the sowing jointing stage of which only two mild droughts occurred under the remaining 10 cold events most of huang huai hai plain was in a drought free and non humid period there was a weak correlation between the occurrence of cold events and drought conditions which had little effect on drought during the sowing jointing stage during the jointing flowering stage six mild drought events occurred during the study period of which only three warm events occurred during the drought period current year or previous year the other 12 warm events occurred under drought free conditions and there was a positive correlation between the occurrence of warm events and drought conditions however the correlation was weak similar to the sowing jointing stage there was weak correlation between the occurrence of cold events and drought conditions during the jointing flowering stage under the 12 cold events during the study period huang huai hai plain was almost drought free and non humid during the flowering maturation stage there were five less severe drought conditions during the study period among which warm events in the current year or previous year occurred in four of the drought periods and the other 16 warm events were mostly drought free with a large positive correlation between the occurrence of warm events and drought conditions during the study period 15 cold events occurred during the flowering maturation stage of which only one mild drought occurred the spei of the remaining 14 cold events was mostly positive and three of them were in a mild wet period spei 0 5 therefore the occurrence of cold events was negatively correlated with drought conditions and had a definite impact on drought conditions during the flowering maturation stage in general there was a positive correlation between the drought status of different fertility stages of summer maize and the occurrence of enso warm events among which the drought status at the sowing jointing and flowering maturation stages were more influenced by enso warm events there was a negative correlation between drought conditions during flowering maturation stage and the occurrence of enso cold events and the other two reproductive stages were less responsive to enso cold events 4 4 2 teleconnection of climate factors and drought the spatial and temporal evolution of droughts their causes were related to sea surface temperature climate factors were the basic factors that governed the formation of climate especially the atmospheric circulation factors that governed the transport of heat moisture and mass at different times and places and played a role in the transfer and redistribution of energy it affected droughts and floods on huang huai hai plain in the form of teleconnection yao et al 2021 from table 4 it can be seen that overall climate factors ao and soi were positively weakly correlated with spei 0 0 1 whereas pdo nao and oni were weakly negatively correlated with the spei pdo nao and oni were more strongly negatively correlated with spei during the sowing jointing stage among them pdo and nao passed the significance test at a 0 1 level and showed a moderate negative correlation with nao which could be used as the main climatic factor affecting the causes of drought during the sowing jointing stage of summer maize the correlation between pdo oni and spei was large and weakly negative at the jointing flowering stage and failed the significance test at a 0 1 level of which the correlation with oni was the largest and could be used as the main climatic factor for the cause of drought in the jointing flowering stage of summer maize during the flowering maturation stage pdo soi and oni were significantly correlated with spei and were weakly negatively correlated with pdo and oni which did not pass the 0 1 level significance test soi was weakly positively correlated with spei and the correlation was more significant passing the significance test at the 0 1 level the soi could be used as the main influencing factor of drought causes in the summer maize flowering maturation stage the above analysis showed that the main climatic factors affecting the causes of drought in the three fertility stages of summer maize nao oni and soi were negatively correlated with nao and oni and positively correlated with soi based on the above analysis the main climatic factors affecting drought in the three growth stages of summer maize were nao oni and soi which were negatively correlated with nao and oni and positively correlated with soi combined with the summer maize growing period the best overall correlation with oni was found to be the most suitable climatic factor for analyzing the causes of drought in the summer maize growing period on huang huai hai plain the spei has the advantage of a more flexible spi time scale and the advantage of a pdsi that takes into account the water balance it is now a widely used drought index previously spei time scales were at a minimum monthly scale based on this the daily scale spei has a more precise and flexible time scale allowing for droughts to be accurately timed to daily weekly decadal and monthly by comparing drought events detected by the daily scale spei with those recorded in the chinese meteorological disasters canon the results were shown in the table below table 5 from the table 5 we can find that the daily scale spei has good applicability on huang huai hai plain previously some scholars used monthly scale spei to detect drought conditions during summer maize growing period on huang huai hai plain it was found that the drought mainly occurred during the sowing flowering period of summer maize wu et al 2019 however we found by daily scale spei that drought occurs mainly at flowering maturation stage some scholars have found from studies on the applicability of various drought indices in northern china that the monthly scale spei tends to underestimate spring drought in northern regions wang et al 2020 considering that drought is a meteorological hazard the time scale is flexible therefore the same drought index can vary considerably with different time scales although the daily scale spei took into account the water balance the response of vegetation and other factors to drought needed to be considered on huang huai hai plain the index did not yet explain the mechanisms of drought occurrence well further discussion on the effects of vegetation anthropogenic factors and atmospheric circulation on drought on huang huai hai plain is needed later 5 conclusion 1 the most frequent and severe drought occurred in the 1960 s during the sowing jointing stage of summer maize on huang huai hai plain and the entire plain was in a drought prone area drought occurred least frequently during the jointing flowering stage it was mostly in a light drought zone overall but with large regional variations drought occurred most frequently during the flowering maturation stage mainly in drought prone and very drought prone areas 2 the longer drought epoch of the sowing jointing stage was mainly concentrated in the 1960 s covering almost the entire huang huai hai plain the drought epochs diminished after 1997 duration of drought during the jointing flowering stage was short and scattered duration of drought during the flowering maturation stage was long and the distribution was more balanced throughout huang huai hai plain overall the drought situation improved 3 in the recent 61 years drought conditions at the sowing jointing and flowering maturation stages of summer maize on huang huai hai plain displayed a large positive correlation with the occurrence of warm events while the flowering maturation stage displayed a large negative correlation with the occurrence of cold events oni was the most suitable climatic factor for analyzing causes of drought during summer maize growing period on huang huai hai plain declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9023,huang huai hai plain is an important area for summer maize production in china the study of drought characteristics during summer maize growing period is of guiding significance for preventing drought and flooding and ensuring grain production based on daily meteorological data from 1960 to 2020 on huang huai hai plain daily drought indicators were used to quantitatively identify drought conditions during summer maize growing period analyze spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of drought and explore the teleconnection between climate change and drought characteristics results showed that the most frequent and long lasting drought occurred during the summer maize sowing jointing stage on huang huai hai plain in the 1960 s and the entire plain was basically in a drought prone area in the last 61a drought occurred less frequently was short lived throughout the reproductive stage during jointing flowering and was concentrated in the light drought zone drought frequency in the flowering maturation stage was highest during the entire growth period and drought frequency displayed a high low high three stage distribution from south to north mainly in drought prone and extremely drought prone areas the drought barycenter during the sowing jointing stage showed an east west distribution pattern and moved eastward from 1970 to 2000 displaying a south north distribution pattern during jointing flowering and flowering maturation stages drought conditions at the sowing jointing and flowering maturation stages of summer maize displayed positive correlation with the occurrence of el niño southern oscillation enso warm events and the flowering maturation stage displayed a negative correlation with the occurrence of enso cold events oceanic nino index oni

barycenter summer maize growing period data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years global climate anomalies and a continuous increase in surface temperature have led to frequent droughts heavy rains and floods han et al 2021 shi et al 2021 which are widely distributed and heavily affected further aggravating the imbalance in the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources han 2005 this imbalance not only affects industrial and agricultural production but also threatens human life health and property security which has caused widespread concern worldwide grayson 2013 shiru et al 2020 the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar6 predicts an accelerated rate of global warming and states that global temperature increases are expected to reach or exceed 1 5 c under this scenario further changes in the global water cycle in the future will result in stronger precipitation floods and more severe droughts zhou et al 2021 as a meteorological disaster with high frequency long duration and wide impact drought has caused serious impact on economic and social development worldwide particularly on agricultural production guan et al 2018 since the mid 1950 s north africa alaska canada and much of eurasia have experienced widespread drought dai et al 2004 spinoni et al 2014 dai 2011 showed that from 1950 to 2008 global average annual growth rate of areas experiencing drought was approximately 1 74 as a traditionally agricultural country china has been affected by climate change and drought has become increasingly severe since the 1990 s severe and extreme droughts are frequent and the drought area continues to increase by approximately 3 72 every 10 years yu et al 2014 drought indicators are the basis for carrying out drought monitoring and risk assessments as well as an effective tool for studying the evolutionary characteristics of drought the palmer drought severity index pdsi based on soil water balance theory is one of the most widely used drought indices worldwide which effectively solves regional drought monitoring and forecasting problems however it is influenced by the calibration period limitation of spatial comparability and subjectivity of the drought class definition guttman et al 1992 yan et al 2009 in response to the problems of the pdsi mckee et al 1993 proposed the standardized precipitation index spi which is based on probability distribution of precipitation with multiple time scales therefore the spi was soon developed and widely accepted in drought research however only the precipitation variation was considered in the spi calculations and the role of temperature was neglected in 2010 vicente serrano et al 2012 developed a new standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which is based on the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration the spei not only considers the influence of temperature on drought severity but also retains the multi scale and multi spatial features in the spi which is applicable to the analysis of drought characteristics in the context of global warming different evapotranspiration formulae have different physical meanings and consider different meteorological elements therefore the calculated spei will produce differences potential evaporative emission pet based on the thornthwaite th equation requires only temperature data is simple to calculate and is widely used luo et al 2016 liu et al 2021 however the thornthwaite method is only applicable for calculating the pet in wet areas in arid and semi arid areas pet will be underestimated and less able to assess drought because it is not only determined by ambient temperature pet calculations should include correct physical calculations to account for radiation and aerodynamic effects guo et al 2019 therefore many experts and scholars recommend using the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao penman monteith pm method to calculate pet the method is a more realistic calculation that considers the variability of available energy humidity and wind speed zhao et al 2015 and is more physically comprehensive the spei calculated based on this method can better estimate true global drought trends chen and sun 2015 huang huai hai plain is an important summer maize production base in china zhou 2018 and the summer maize cultivation area accounts for approximately one third of the country maize is a mild and high water consuming crop and the entire reproductive process requires higher meteorological conditions such as temperature and precipitation wang 2018 cao et al 2020 the occurrence of drought is bound to have an impact on growth and development which in turn may affect corn yields and cause agricultural and economic losses at present many scholars have used the larger timescale spei pm to characterize drought such as using the monthly scale drought indicators that are less sensitive to short term drought occurring during crop growth and development period ming et al 2015 potopová et al 2015 li et al 2017 however droughts occur at irregular times and are difficult to identify accurately on a purely monthly scale for short periods of intense drought based on monthly scale monitoring it is possible to go from no drought to exceptional drought in one month which is not consistent with the process of drought occurrence in order to accurately identify short lived droughts that occur during crop growth and development we should use smaller time scale drought indicators for monitoring and analysis to better reveal drought characteristics during crop growth and development therefore to address the problem of short and high intensity droughts occurring during the summer maize growing period we used the daily scale spei pm to quantitatively identify the drought conditions during the summer maize growing period on the huang huai hai plain the aim is to provide a scientific and theoretical basis for the production and drought prevention and mitigation of summer maize on the huang huai hai plain from the perspective of key fertility stages 2 overview of study area huang huai hai plain 31 43 n 110 123 e is located south of yanshan mountain and north of huaihe river and includes beijing tianjin hebei province shandong province henan province jiangsu province and anhui province it covers an area of approximately 330 000 km2 a vast area with low and flat terrain and complex topography chen et al 2020 most of which is less than 50 m above sea level the eastern coastal plain is less than 10 m above sea level and is a typical alluvial plain hao et al 2010 huang huai hai plain has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate it has a hot and rainy season with 2800 h of sunshine per year natural conditions are extremely favorable for growth and development of maize and it is the largest summer maize planting area in china wu et al 2019 huang huai hai plain is one of the most water scarce regions in china with an annual precipitation of 500 800 mm showing a distribution pattern greater in the south than the north annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 1000 mm and most regions are in a state of precipitation deficit making it one of the most drought stricken areas in china zhou and zhang

summer maize growing period into three stages sowing jointing jointing flowering and flowering maturation stages liu 2002 average multi year fertility of summer maize on huang huai hai plain is shown in table 1 3 3 research methodology 3 3 1 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spei was obtained by calculating the difference between daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and conducting normal standardization the first step was to calculate daily potential evapotranspiration this study adopted the pm model recommended by the fao zhao et al 2015 1 p e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where pet 0 is potential evapotranspiration mm d 1 r n is net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 t is average daily temperature c u 2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 e s is saturation water vapor pressure kpa e a is actual water vapor pressure kpa δ is slope of the saturation water vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 and γ is the dry and wet table constant the second step was to calculate the difference between daily precipitation and evapotranspiration 2 d i p i p e t i where d i is the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration p i is daily precipitation and pet i is daily potential evapotranspiration in the third step the data series d i was fitted and best fit was achieved by using a three parameter log logistic probability distribution function 3 f x β α x γ α β 1 1 x γ α β 2 in the formula the parameters α and γ can be obtained using the linear moment l

obtained as 5 f x 1 α x γ β 1 in the fourth step the cumulative probability density was normalized 6 s p e i w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 w 2 i n p where when p 0 5 p f x when and p 1 f

shown in table 2 based on the meteorological drought rating issued by the national climate center gb t 20481 2017 the spei of different timescales reflects availability of different water sources and soil moisture is more sensitive to the short timescale spei therefore this study used daily scale spei to study drought trends of summer maize growing period on huang huai hai plain 3 3 2 quantitative characterization of drought 1 drought duration when the spei is less than or equal to 0 5 for 10 consecutive days then a drought process is determined to have occurred the start of the drought process is the first day of the 10 consecutive days during the onset of drought the drought lifts when the spei is greater than 0 5 for 10 consecutive days and the drought process ends the end date is the day before the first day of the 10 days the time from the beginning to the end of the drought process is drought duration 2 drought intensity drought intensity is the sum of the spei of all days within the drought process for drought levels above mild drought and a larger value indicates a stronger drought process 3 drought frequency df drought frequency is the ratio of the number of drought years to the total number of years in a particular development stage of summer maize at a particular site during the study period 7 d f n n 100 where n is the number of years in which drought occurred at a particular developmental stage of summer maize at a site during the study period and n is the total number of years in the study period the greater the df value the more frequent the drought 4 drought barycenter drought barycenter was expressed as the position longitude latitude and time of the drought event in three dimensional space time domain and drought barycenter in this study was calculated as follows 8 x t i 1 n a t i b t i x i i 1 n a t i b t i y t i 1 n a t i b t i y i i 1 n a t i b t i where x t and y t are longitude and latitude coordinates of the regional drought gravity center in period t respectively x i and y i are longitude and latitude coordinates of the ith meteorological station respectively a t i is drought frequency at meteorological station i during period t b t i is drought intensity of meteorological station i in period t and n is total number of meteorological stations in the region 3 3 3 pearson correlation coefficient the pearson correlation coefficient can quantitatively describe the degree of correlation between climate factors and drought indices liu et al 2022 assuming that there are n data points for a i b i i 1 2 n the specific formula is as follows 8 r i 1 n a i a b i b i 1 n a i a 2 i 1 n b i b 2 where r is a real number between 1 1 when r is between 0 8 r 1 0 5 r 0 8 0 3 r 0 5 0 1 r 0 3 0 r 0 1 it indicates that the two are strongly highly moderately and weakly correlated respectively wu 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 frequency of droughts 4 1 1 time varying characteristics drought levels were assessed according to the spei and the frequency of drought at different fertility stages at each site on huang huai hai plain at 10 years intervals from 1960 to 2020 was counted fig 2 from fig 2 it can be seen that the most frequent droughts during different fertility stages of summer maize occurred during flowering maturation stage followed by sowing jointing stage and the least frequent droughts occurred during the jointing flowering stage which was approximately half of the flowering maturation stage in terms of drought occurrence time the most frequent and severe droughts occurred in the 1960 s during the sowing jointing stage with 127 severe and more severe droughts occurring much greater than the total number of severe and more severe droughts occurring during the latter 51a compared to the 2000 s the frequency of drought in the last 10a sowing jointing stage showed a significant increase the frequency of drought during the summer maize reproductive and jointing flowering stages was low the most frequent droughts occurred from 2010 to 2020 including 25 severe and more severe droughts and the least frequent droughts occurred in the 1970 s including 15 severe droughts with no extreme droughts the frequency of drought occurred most frequently during the flowering maturation stage frequency of drought occurring in the last six interdecadal periods did not vary much and was stable in contrast to the jointing flowering stage the most frequent droughts occurred in the 1970 s during the flowering maturation stage including 35 severe and more severe droughts and frequency of droughts occurring in the flowering maturation stage in the last 10a showed an increase in terms of the occurrence of drought types moderate drought was the most frequent in the entire reproductive stage of summer maize followed by mild drought both of which accounted for approximately 90 of overall drought frequency while the least was extreme drought which occurred 81 times mainly in the 1960 s and 1970 s during the sowing jointing stage the 1990 s during jointing flowering stage and the 1960 s during flowering maturation stage 4 1 2 spatial distribution characteristics according to the drought frequency of each station on huang huai hai plain using the kriging method to interpolate the spatial distribution of drought frequency during summer maize growing period fig 3 the natural grading method was used to classify drought frequency from low to high specifically low drought less than 20 light drought 20 30 general drought 30 40 moderate drought 40 50 severe drought more than 50 regions low drought areas less than 20 light drought 20 30 normal drought 30 40 easy drought 40 50 and very easy drought areas greater than 50 as shown in fig 3 frequency of drought during sowing jointing stage ranged from 32 8 to 52 5 with a mean value of 41 5 drought frequency after interpolation ranged from 39 2 to 46 2 with little regional variation and was drought prone overall with the southwestern part of agricultural zone iv being more drought prone during the sowing jointing stage frequency of drought occurrence during the jointing flowering stage was generally small ranging from 19 7 to 36 1 with a mean value of 28 5 and large regional differences with the greatest frequency of drought occurring in baodi bd 1 and the least frequency of drought occurring in liaocheng lc interpolated drought frequency ranged from 23 4 to 36 1 and from the spatial distribution there was an overall patchy distribution with high north and low south values the general drought area was concentrated in the local areas of agricultural zones i and ii in the eastern part of huang huai hai plain including baodi bd 1 leting lt jinghai jh 1 baoding bd 2 cangzhou cz 1 and jizhou jz while other areas were generally light drought areas frequency of drought during flowering maturation stage was generally higher and interpolated drought frequency was between 47 6 and 60 6 from the spatial distribution the difference in regional drought frequency was more obvious and overall distribution was high low high from south to north mainly in drought prone and extremely drought prone areas and the drought situation was more severe drought prone areas were concentrated in the central part of huang huai hai plain including yucheng yc jiyang jy and binzhou bz 2 in agricultural zone iii luohe lh yushi ws and puyang py 1 in agricultural zone iv and shouguang sg zibo zb and ningyang ny in agricultural zone v the other areas were generally very drought prone 4 2 drought duration to analyze the drought ephemeris of three fertility stages of summer maize at typical stations on huang huai hai plain in the last 61a the heatmap from matlab was used to draw the drought ephemeris distribution of summer maize growing period from 1960 to 2020 fig 4 duration of drought during the sowing jointing stage ranged from 0 to 38d and was mainly concentrated between 25 and 35d prolonged and persistent drought processes were mainly concentrated in the 1960 s except for the 1960 s almost all stations experienced prolonged and persistent droughts in 1974 1992 1997 and 2019 indicating that the entire huang huai hai plain may have been influenced by large scale weather systems during these years resulting in its extensive drought in terms of agricultural zoning droughts lasting more than 35d during the sowing jointing stage were mainly concentrated in zones iii and v cangzhou cz 1 in zone ii and binzhou bz 2 puyang py 1 jiyang jy and daming dm in zone iii they had a longer duration and higher frequency of droughts during the study period in the past three years only zones i ii and v of the six agricultural zones on huang huai hai plain had a long duration of drought whereas the remaining three agricultural zones had a short duration of drought or no drought duration of drought during the jointing flowering stage ranged from 0 to 24d and was mainly concentrated between 15 and 20d in terms of time the jointing flowering stage drought episodes were more scattered without more concentrated periods and the duration of the drought was also short but almost all sites in the two years 2014 and 2019 experienced a prolonged and sustained drought in terms of agricultural zoning droughts lasting more than 20d during the jointing flowering stage were mainly concentrated in zones i ii and vi with the highest concentration in zone ii which also corresponds to the high frequency of droughts in agricultural zone ii during the jointing flowering stage in the previous section baodi bd 1 beichen bc bazhou bz 1 and texas dz in zone ii experienced drought events of more than 20d during the study period duration of drought during the flowering maturation stage ranged from 0 to 48d and was mainly concentrated between 20 and 30d in terms of time the long duration drought process was mainly concentrated in zones i ii and iii from 1997 to 2002 and the duration of drought at each site was shorter in 2020 from the viewpoint of agricultural sub districts the overall ephemeral distribution of drought in each sub district was relatively scattered and the duration of drought within the flowering maturation stage exceeded 40d mainly in zones i and ii baodi bd 1 jinghai jh 1 bazhou bz 1 and xian counties xx 1 in zone ii had longer drought duration and higher frequency during the study period 4 3 drought barycenter based on the drought epochs and intensity at different fertility stages of summer maize on huang huai hai plain from 1960 to 2020 the center of gravity model was used to calculate the drought barycenter and its migration trajectory for the last six epochs of summer maize growing period fig 5 the migration direction and distance of each epoch relative to the previous epoch were also determined table 3 from fig 5 it can be seen that the drought barycenter during the sowing jointing stage had an east west distribution pattern mainly located between 35 30 n 36 00 n and 115 55 e 117 45 e in the eastward position of the center of huang huai hai plain in terms of migration direction the drought barycenter migrated in the northeast southeast southeast and northeast during the sowing jointing stage in the 1970 s 1980 s 1990 s and the 2000 s respectively the drought barycenter generally migrated eastward during these five years drought barycenter in 2010 2020 was 65 43 km to the northwest and in the west was about the same longitude as that of the 1990 s from the previous section it can be seen that the drought duration of the recent 61a sowing jointing stage showed a spatial distribution with a significantly decreasing trend in the eastern region and a non significant decreasing trend in the western region which may have led to the eastward migration trend of the drought barycenter in terms of migration distance the drought barycenter in the 2000 s sowing jointing stage shifted the most than the other five eras at 78 95 km indicating that the sowing jointing stage displayed a large difference in the degree of drought in the east and west of this era the smallest drought barycenter migration distance was only 36 63 km during the sowing jointing stage in the 1970 s indicating that the difference in drought degree between the eastern and western regions during the sowing jointing stage in the 1970 s was small compared with the sowing jointing stage the drought barycenter in the jointing flowering stage was generally distributed in a south north pattern mainly located between approximately 34 20 n 37 30 n and 116 10 e 117 10 e which is located to the east of the center of huang huai hai plain spanning agricultural zones iii iv and v in terms of migration direction the drought barycenter during the last six eras of the jointing flowering stage showed an overall south north alternating migration trend with high volatility from the previous section it can be seen that although the drought duration of the recent 61a jointing flowering stage were basically stable the base of the drought epoch and intensity were small and percentage change was large the jointing flowering stage showed a spatial distribution of tighter overall drought conditions in the northern region and slower overall drought conditions in the southern region which may have led to a general south north alternating migration trend of its drought barycenter in terms of migration distance the migration span of each chronological period of the jointing flowering stage was the largest among the three reproductive stages and the drought barycenter in the 1980 s jointing flowering stage was the largest than the other five chronological periods at 292 27 km and difference in the degree of drought in the northern and southern regions was greater at this time the distance of drought barycenter migration was the smallest in the 1990 s during the jointing flowering stage at 129 67 km and the difference in drought degree in the northern and southern regions was relatively small similar to the jointing flowering stage the drought barycenter in the flowering maturation stage also showed a south north distribution pattern but the north south span was relatively small in terms of migration direction except for the 1990 s when the drought barycenter of the flowering maturation stage drought tended to shift westward the drought barycenter of the flowering maturation stage drought in the rest of the years showed an alternating south north migration trend in general however fluctuations were relatively small the aforementioned migration of the drought barycenter during flowering maturation stage was more related to the monsoon circulation huang huai hai plain is located at the edge of the monsoonal climate zone precipitation during the sowing jointing stage is not only affected by the east asian summer monsoon but also by the mid high latitude circulation to a great extent precipitation is generally lower in the north and higher in the south simultaneously it can be seen from the previous section that drought duration in the flowering maturation stage in the past 61 years also showed a spatial distribution in which the overall drought in the northern region became more severe and overall drought in the southern region decreased the migration distance of the drought barycenter in the flowering maturation stage was the largest in the past 10 years and it migrated 149 16 km to the southwest during this time the degrees of drought in the northern and southern regions were quite different the distance of drought barycenter migration during the flowering maturation stage in the 1970 s was the smallest only 46 08 km and the difference in the degrees of drought in the northern and southern regions was relatively small overall the drought barycenter in the three fertility stages of summer maize exhibited a similar migration direction northeast in the 2000 s whereas the drought barycenter in the three fertility stages of summer maize generally exhibited a southward and westward migration trend in the 1990 s and from 2010 to 2020 overall the drought barycenter of the three growth stages of summer maize exhibited a similar migration direction northeast in the 2000 s whereas in the 1990 s and 2010 2020 the drought barycenter in the three growth stages of summer maize generally exhibited a southward and westward migration trend 4 4 teleconnection of climate change and drought characteristics 4 4 1 teleconnection of el niño southern oscillation enso cold and warm events with drought based on the spei at different fertility stages of summer maize on huang huai hai plain from 1960 to 2020 the spei of each fertility stage was correlated with enso cold and warm events and the relationship between spei and enso cold and warm events during summer maize growing period was analyzed as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 during the sowing jointing stage a total of nine drought conditions of different degrees occurred on huang huai hai plain in the last 61a among which warm events in the current or previous year occurred in six drought periods and there was a large positive correlation between the occurrence of warm events and drought conditions in the past 61 years 12 cold events occurred during the sowing jointing stage of which only two mild droughts occurred under the remaining 10 cold events most of huang huai hai plain was in a drought free and non humid period there was a weak correlation between the occurrence of cold events and drought conditions which had little effect on drought during the sowing jointing stage during the jointing flowering stage six mild drought events occurred during the study period of which only three warm events occurred during the drought period current year or previous year the other 12 warm events occurred under drought free conditions and there was a positive correlation between the occurrence of warm events and drought conditions however the correlation was weak similar to the sowing jointing stage there was weak correlation between the occurrence of cold events and drought conditions during the jointing flowering stage under the 12 cold events during the study period huang huai hai plain was almost drought free and non humid during the flowering maturation stage there were five less severe drought conditions during the study period among which warm events in the current year or previous year occurred in four of the drought periods and the other 16 warm events were mostly drought free with a large positive correlation between the occurrence of warm events and drought conditions during the study period 15 cold events occurred during the flowering maturation stage of which only one mild drought occurred the spei of the remaining 14 cold events was mostly positive and three of them were in a mild wet period spei 0 5 therefore the occurrence of cold events was negatively correlated with drought conditions and had a definite impact on drought conditions during the flowering maturation stage in general there was a positive correlation between the drought status of different fertility stages of summer maize and the occurrence of enso warm events among which the drought status at the sowing jointing and flowering maturation stages were more influenced by enso warm events there was a negative correlation between drought conditions during flowering maturation stage and the occurrence of enso cold events and the other two reproductive stages were less responsive to enso cold events 4 4 2 teleconnection of climate factors and drought the spatial and temporal evolution of droughts their causes were related to sea surface temperature climate factors were the basic factors that governed the formation of climate especially the atmospheric circulation factors that governed the transport of heat moisture and mass at different times and places and played a role in the transfer and redistribution of energy it affected droughts and floods on huang huai hai plain in the form of teleconnection yao et al 2021 from table 4 it can be seen that overall climate factors ao and soi were positively weakly correlated with spei 0 0 1 whereas pdo nao and oni were weakly negatively correlated with the spei pdo nao and oni were more strongly negatively correlated with spei during the sowing jointing stage among them pdo and nao passed the significance test at a 0 1 level and showed a moderate negative correlation with nao which could be used as the main climatic factor affecting the causes of drought during the sowing jointing stage of summer maize the correlation between pdo oni and spei was large and weakly negative at the jointing flowering stage and failed the significance test at a 0 1 level of which the correlation with oni was the largest and could be used as the main climatic factor for the cause of drought in the jointing flowering stage of summer maize during the flowering maturation stage pdo soi and oni were significantly correlated with spei and were weakly negatively correlated with pdo and oni which did not pass the 0 1 level significance test soi was weakly positively correlated with spei and the correlation was more significant passing the significance test at the 0 1 level the soi could be used as the main influencing factor of drought causes in the summer maize flowering maturation stage the above analysis showed that the main climatic factors affecting the causes of drought in the three fertility stages of summer maize nao oni and soi were negatively correlated with nao and oni and positively correlated with soi based on the above analysis the main climatic factors affecting drought in the three growth stages of summer maize were nao oni and soi which were negatively correlated with nao and oni and positively correlated with soi combined with the summer maize growing period the best overall correlation with oni was found to be the most suitable climatic factor for analyzing the causes of drought in the summer maize growing period on huang huai hai plain the spei has the advantage of a more flexible spi time scale and the advantage of a pdsi that takes into account the water balance it is now a widely used drought index previously spei time scales were at a minimum monthly scale based on this the daily scale spei has a more precise and flexible time scale allowing for droughts to be accurately timed to daily weekly decadal and monthly by comparing drought events detected by the daily scale spei with those recorded in the chinese meteorological disasters canon the results were shown in the table below table 5 from the table 5 we can find that the daily scale spei has good applicability on huang huai hai plain previously some scholars used monthly scale spei to detect drought conditions during summer maize growing period on huang huai hai plain it was found that the drought mainly occurred during the sowing flowering period of summer maize wu et al 2019 however we found by daily scale spei that drought occurs mainly at flowering maturation stage some scholars have found from studies on the applicability of various drought indices in northern china that the monthly scale spei tends to underestimate spring drought in northern regions wang et al 2020 considering that drought is a meteorological hazard the time scale is flexible therefore the same drought index can vary considerably with different time scales although the daily scale spei took into account the water balance the response of vegetation and other factors to drought needed to be considered on huang huai hai plain the index did not yet explain the mechanisms of drought occurrence well further discussion on the effects of vegetation anthropogenic factors and atmospheric circulation on drought on huang huai hai plain is needed later 5 conclusion 1 the most frequent and severe drought occurred in the 1960 s during the sowing jointing stage of summer maize on huang huai hai plain and the entire plain was in a drought prone area drought occurred least frequently during the jointing flowering stage it was mostly in a light drought zone overall but with large regional variations drought occurred most frequently during the flowering maturation stage mainly in drought prone and very drought prone areas 2 the longer drought epoch of the sowing jointing stage was mainly concentrated in the 1960 s covering almost the entire huang huai hai plain the drought epochs diminished after 1997 duration of drought during the jointing flowering stage was short and scattered duration of drought during the flowering maturation stage was long and the distribution was

9024,the scarcity of freshwater resources has suppressed the sustainable development of agriculture especially tomato production adopting salty water irrigation is considered a promising strategy for alleviating the scarcity of freshwater resources however the effects of salty water electrical conductivity ec and cultivation conditions on tomato yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and fruit quality remain unclear in this study we conducted a meta analysis based on 1230 data pairs from 56 research papers reporting these aspects of tomato production overall salty water irrigation significantly decreased tomato yield 26 15 and iwue 24 65 and increased total soluble solids 13 68 organic acids 13 78 sugar and acid ratio 8 04 and vitamin c 9 78 compared to freshwater irrigation reduction in tomato yield and iwue increased with salty water ec brackish ec 3 ds m 1 and moderately saline water 3 ec 8 ds m 1 were recommended considering their greater potential to maintain both yield and quality though soil bulk density had no significant effect on tomato yield the soil with high bulk density was beneficial for improving tomato quality increasing soil organic matter reduces the negative effects of salty water irrigation a win win analysis showed that brackish and moderately saline water were suitable for drip irrigation and alkaline soils these results will be beneficial to maintain high yields and fruit quality in tomato production using salty water irrigation graphical abstract ga1 keywords meta analysis salty water tomato yield tomato fruit quality irrigation water use efficiency data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the shortage of freshwater resources due to climate change and population growth is one of the major problems faced globally particularly in agriculture aljohani 2017 cheng et al 2021a pan et al 2020 it is estimated that more than 70 of fresh water is used for agricultural production however this is not sufficient to meet the increasing demand for agricultural water particularly in arid and semi arid regions such as northwest china egypt and saudi arabia chen et al 2021 the irrigation water shortage has been aggravated by the increased intensity and frequency of drought events due to global climate change chen et al 2021 therefore adopting new water resource management strategies is an effective means to ensure optimum agricultural productivity seawater desalination and efficient use of salty water are crucial for alleviating the escalating water shortage pan et al 2020 however seawater desalination is impractical for solving the water crisis in inland areas as transportation is prohibitively expensive cheng et al 2021a pan et al 2020 therefore to alleviate the freshwater resource scarcity developing appropriate irrigation strategies using salty water is a pressing challenge currently the tomato fruit is abundant in nutrients including vitamin c vc and lycopene which potentially prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and cancer lu et al 2012 it is one of the most preferred edibles and widely cultivated vegetables worldwide cheng et al 2017 du et al 2018 however due to freshwater shortages the gap between tomato supply and demand has increased although several water saving irrigation methods have been explored water shortage remains a considerable challenge restricting sustainable tomato production lu et al 2021 therefore salty water irrigation can be a crucial strategy to alleviate the pressure of water shortages to a large extent cheng et al 2021a salty water has been used worldwide for hundreds of years and recognized in different regions of 17 countries cheng et al 2021a li et al 2019 although irrigation with salty water has been reported to reduce tomato yield fruit quality improvement is remarkable and can still be widely accepted li et al 2022a yan et al 2021 however conditions for salty water irrigation in tomato production on a global scale lack systematic analysis hence it is crucial to unveil the impact of salty water irrigation on tomato yield and quality which is also effective in coping with uncertain water resources and developing scientific agricultural salty water irrigation there are still some issues associated with salty water application such as introduction of salts to soils more salt ions cause salt stress to the tomato plant cheng et al 2021a li et al 2022b on one hand salt stress decreases soil water potential and changes in osmotic potential between soil and root cells lead to inhibited root water uptake and damage to tomato cells li et al 2022b on the other hand under salt stress the concentration of na and cl in plants increases and induce ion toxicity in tomato which may inhibit photosynthesis li et al 2022b shahid et al 2020 specifically salt stress and ion toxicity triggers a rapid increase of endogenous abscisic acid aba production in the plant which further regulates stomatal closure thereby affecting the accumulation of photosynthetic products leading to a decline in yield cheng et al 2021a li et al 2022a at the same time to protect plants from salt stress and maintain cellular integrity the osmotic adjustment system creates more osmotic adjustment substances soluble sugar ss free proline gao et al 2019 during salty water irrigation tomato fruit showed increased organic acid oa content which seems to counterbalance the excess na to maintain internal ph and ionic balance cuartero and fernández muñoz 1998 wang et al 2011 additionally salt stress exacerbates chloroplast production of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical resulting in oxidative stress zhu 2016 tomato has a complex system of antioxidants that produces more antioxidant substances such as vc and lycopene which maintain a reducing environment in the cells cui et al 2014 hou et al 2020 ripoll et al 2014 together oa ss and vc can significantly change tomato fruit taste and quality however the impact of salty water irrigation on tomato quality and yield remains controversial for example in comparison to freshwater irrigation several studies have reported no decline in tomato yield and no significant increase in total soluble solids tss during salty water irrigation choudhary et al 2010 zayton et al 2009 zhai et al 2016 these results can be attributed to differences in irrigation water electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio soil characteristics climate characteristics cultivation sites and planting years li et al 2019 thus the effects of salty water irrigation on tomato yield and quality are complex however a comprehensive review and quantitative analysis of salty water irrigation on tomato yield and quality is yet to be conducted this limits the development of strategies for salty water irrigation in tomato production specifically developing a plan for appropriate salty water irrigation conditions to improve tomato yield and quality is a crucial issue that needs to be addressed meta analysis is widely used in qualitative and quantitative assessments of multiple independent studies on a subject therefore it is a reliable and scientific statistical model that is commonly used in agricultural research cheng et al 2021a du et al 2018 researchers have used meta analysis to evaluate the effects of deficit irrigation on crop yield nitrogen supply on tomato yield and salty water irrigation on crop yield which are essential for cost saving in agricultural production cheng et al 2021a 2021c du et al 2018 however a previous meta analysis focused on the yield and water productivity of tomato wheat cotton and other crops under saline water irrigation cheng et al 2021a a meta analysis of tomato quality indicators is still lacking furthermore previous studies did not consider the influence of different cultivation sites and planting years on tomato yield cheng et al 2021a therefore in this study we conducted a global meta analysis of the effects of salty water irrigation on tomato yield and fruit quality this analysis aimed to identify and quantify the effects of salty water irrigation on tomato yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and fruit quality the results suggest that further comprehensive utilization of salty water is required to alleviate freshwater resource crisis 2 materials and

m 1 moderately saline water 3 ec 8 ds m 1 and saline water ec 8 ds m 1 cheng et al 2021a paranychianakis and chartzoulakis 2005 2 2 data analysis response ratio lnrr was calculated using the metafor package 3 8 1 in r to analyze and integrate the collected tomato yield iwue and tomato quality data lnrr was used to reflect the influence of salty water irrigation on each variable value the calculation formula is as follows eq 1 1 ln rr ln x e ln x c where x e represents the average yield quality and iwue of tomato under salty water irrigation and x c represents average yield quality and iwue under fresh water irrigation tong et al 2022 the variance of lnrr was calculated by eq 2 2 v s e 2 n e x e 2 s c 2 n c x e 2 where n e and n c represent the experimental and control groups sample numbers respectively and s e and s c represent the standard deviation of the experimental and control groups respectively benítez lópez et al 2017 the weighted method was used to calculate the average response ratio to eliminate the unequal variation as much as possible eqs 3 4 3 ln rr i 1 k w i ln rr i 1 k w i 4 w i 1 v in the formula k represents the number of studies w i represents the weight of

zero there was no significant effect of salty water irrigation on the variable if the 95 confidence interval was more than zero there was a significant positive effect under salty water irrigation on the variable sha et al 2021 finally to facilitate the interpretation of the results the following percentage change was used eq 7 7 percentage change rr 1 100 the ggplot package of the r software was used to complete the frequency distribution map effect size and forest map 2 3 publication bias test the i2 values represent heterogeneity between the data pairs in general i2 50 was considered as low heterogeneity and the fixed effect model was used to calculate the response ratio by contrast the random effects model was used tong et al 2022 in our study the yield iwue tss oa sar and vc showed high heterogeneity table s1 therefore the random effects model was used to calculate the response ratio this may affect the results of the meta analysis when there is a publication bias therefore we used a funnel plot and rosenthal fail safe number nf to determine any publication bias if the funnel plot is symmetric there is no publication bias irwig et al 1998 if nf 5 n 10 n is the sample size of the effect then there was no publication bias and the greater the value the more robust the results adu et al 2018 the results showed that the funnel plots of tomato yield tss oa sar vc and iwue were symmetrical the nf of yield tss oa sar vc and iwue were greater than 5 n 10 table s1 in general the meta analysis results were stable and reliable without any publication bias 3 results 3 1 effects of salty water irrigation on tomato yield the results of this study showed that salty water irrigation strongly affected tomato yield fig 1 tomato yield changes were significantly different among the three irrigation salinities by contrast brackish water irrigation showed the least decline 12 9 95 ci 16 60 to 9 04 fig 1 in brackish water irrigation the tomato yield was significantly affected by the cultivation sites and mat fig 2 for example a significant decrease in yield in the greenhouse 23 68 95 ci 31 40 to 15 08 and mat 12 18 16 95 ci 25 74 to 9 81 were observed compared to the controls fig 2 under moderately saline water irrigation only the soil bulk density had an insignificant effect on tomato yield fig 2 f we observed a lesser reduction in tomato yield in the field 25 11 95 ci 27 89 to 22 23 under drip irrigation 22 32 95 ci 24 63 to 19 94 in the third planting year 9 93 95 ci 13 78 to 5 90 in coarse soils 22 80 95 ci 25 71 to 19 79 under soil ph 7 22 53 95 ci 24 46 to 20 56 under som content 1 5 17 44 95 ci 19 50 to 15 32 and with mat 12 6 54 95 ci 11 49 to 1 31 fig 2 notably with increasing planting years the reduction in tomato yield gradually decreased under brackish water and moderately saline water irrigation fig 2c for brackish water irrigation the tomato yield showed no significant difference in the third planting year 7 44 95 ci 15 86 1 83 compared to the controls fig 2c under saline water irrigation only the cultivation sites and som content had a significant effect on tomato yield fig 2 tomato yield in the greenhouse 67 15 95 ci 72 27 to 61 10 was generally lower than in the field 43 66 95 ci 56 51 to 27 02 interestingly soil bulk density showed an insignificant effect on tomato yield p 0 631 irrespective of the irrigation water ec fig 2 f fig s5 in addition the salty water sodium adsorption ratio was significantly negatively correlated with tomato yield fig s5 3 2 effects of salty water irrigation on iwue of tomato the iwue declined as the ec of the irrigation water increased fig s4 the iwue was not significantly different between brackish water irrigation 16 77 95 ci 42 22 19 88 and the control treatment fig 1 as shown in fig 3 under brackish water irrigation the response of iwue was significantly affected by cultivation site soil texture soil ph and mat for example we observed a significant decreasing tendency of iwue under the greenhouse 76 42 95 ci 89 42 to 47 47 coarse soils 68 68 95 ci 86 40 to 27 84 soil ph 7 76 42 95 ci 89 42 to 47 47 and mat 12 32 38 95 ci 59 27 12 23 compared to the control treatment by contrast iwue was significantly higher under field cultivation medium soil soil ph 7 som content 1 5 soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 and mat 12 compared to the controls treatment fig 3 under moderately saline water irrigation different mat significantly affected iwue mat 12 31 35 95 ci 14 13 51 16 was beneficial for the increase in iwue fig 3h fig 3 shows that iwue increased in the third planting year compared with the first and second planting years and iwue was significantly higher in medium soils than in coarse soils notably the cultivation site soil bulk density som content and irrigation method did not significantly affect iwue in moderately saline water irrigation fig 3 3 3 effects of salty water irrigation on tomato quality the tss content of tomato fruits increased linearly with irrigation water ec fig s4 but there was no significant difference in tss between different irrigation water salinities fig 1 we also showed that the irrigation water sodium adsorption ratio did not significantly affect tss fig s7 the cultivation sites and irrigation methods could significantly affect tomato tss under brackish water irrigation fig 4 for example a greater increase in tomato tss was observed in the groups of greenhouse 20 29 95 ci 16 36 24 35 and drip irrigation 14 42 95 ci 10 70 18 27 subgroups compared to controls fig 4 notably planting year soil texture soil ph som content soil bulk density and mat had insignificant effects on tomato tss under brackish water irrigation fig 4 however under moderately saline irrigation tomato tss was not significantly different among any of the subgroups fig 4 similar trends in tomato tss were observed with respect to the cultivation site irrigation method planting years soil texture and soil bulk density under brackish water and moderate saline water irrigation fig 4 finally subgroup analysis showed that the increases in tss in medium 42 38 95 ci 21 99 66 17 and low bulk density soils 19 48 95 ci 11 23 28 35 were higher under saline water irrigation fig 4 compared with the control treatment salty water irrigation significantly increased the oa of the tomato fruits fig 1 overall soil ph p 0 03 soil bulk density p 0 01 and som content p 0 004 were significantly negatively correlated with the tomato fruit oa content fig s8 however under brackish water irrigation only soil bulk density was found to significantly influence tomato oa content fig 5 a more significant increase in tomato oa content was observed in the groups of soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 15 35 95 ci 10 86 20 02 compared to the control treatment fig 5f however the tomato oa content with respect to planting years mat som content and soil bulk density were observed to have the same trend under brackish water and moderately saline water irrigation fig 5 namely a more significant increase in tomato oa content was observed in the groups with respect to planting years third mat 12 som content 1 5 and soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 compared to the control treatment fig 5 finally tomato oa content in medium soil was significantly higher than that in coarse soil under saline water irrigation fig 5d overall when irrigation water ec was 8 ds m 1 the tomato sar increased with increasing irrigation water ec and was the highest under moderately saline water irrigation fig 1 in brackish water irrigation it is noteworthy that while other subgroups had different degrees of effect on tomato sar we observed significant differences only within the soil texture subgroup fig 6 under brackish water irrigation tomato sar in coarse soils 5 19 ci 1 92 8 56 was significantly higher than that in the control treatment while tomato sar in medium soils 4 59 ci 8 33 to 0 70 was significantly lower than that in the control treatment fig 6d tomato sar with respect to different soil textures som and mat content showed significant differences under moderately saline irrigation fig 6 among these subgroups tomato sar showed greater increase with coarse soils 9 10 95 ci 6 34 11 93 som content 1 5 27 18 95 ci 21 92 32 66 and mat 12 27 18 95 ci 21 92 32 66 compared to the control treatment fig 6 the trend of variation of vc was different from that of tss or oa vc varied quadratically with increasing irrigation water ec fig 1 moderately saline water irrigation had the least effect on the change in vc 5 87 95 ci 0 90 11 07 fig 1 under brackish water vc was significantly different among the som subgroups fig 7 moderately saline water irrigation differed significantly in tomato vc among the cultivation sites and soil bulk density subgroups fig 7 it increased vc in the field and soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 groups by 19 26 95 ci 11 87 27 13 and 24 92 95 ci 18 27 31 93 respectively fig 7 under brackish water or moderately saline water irrigation the tomato fruit vc increased with increasing soil bulk density and som 3 4 best application area of salty water irrigation although irrigation with salty water reduced tomato yield it improved tss oa sar and vc previous studies have demonstrated that increased tomato tss oa sar and vc represents better tomato quality cuartero and fernández muñoz 1998 a win win analysis was conducted to formulate irrigation strategy for salty water tong et al 2022 the tomato yield and tss oa vc effect sizes were divided into different zones according to the average yield effect size and the zero scale as shown in fig 8 five zones were divided with zone a representing irrigation with salty water with a positive effect on tomato yield and tomato fruit quality thus zone a was the target area conversely in zone d salty water irrigation had a negative effect on tomato yield and tomato fruit quality zone b showed that salty water irrigation caused yield decline but was within the average effect size with positive impact on tomato fruit quality therefore zone b was considered acceptable the results indicated that 66 86 59 09 and 54 44 of the samples fell into zones a and b for yield tss yield oa and yield vc respectively fig 8 these samples were the focus of this study at the same time a part of the samples fell into zone c fig 8 where the yield effect sizes were less than average therefore subsequent analysis was not considered further analyses included effects of irrigation water ec soil texture planting years and other factors for the samples in zones a and b the results showed that the percentages of brackish water were significantly higher than those of moderately saline water and saline water table 1 in zones a and b the proportions of drip irrigation greenhouse alkaline soil soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 and mat 12 were larger table 1 the percentages of soil texture were similar among the coarse soils and medium soils the win win analysis did not include tomato fruit sar due to the small sample size 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation water ec on tomato yield iwue and quality the meta analysis demonstrated a strong negative correlation between tomato yield and irrigation water ec fig s4 obviously irrigation with salty water lead to negative effects on tomato yield soil salts increase under salty water irrigation leading to a decline in soil water potential and suppressed plant root ability to obtain soil water due to the osmotic effects despite increased soil water with increased irrigation depth the soil water potential declines making tomato root water absorption challenging causing a decline in soil water availability therefore there was no significant correlation between tomato yield and salty water irrigation depth p 0 086 fig s5 moreover salt stress due to salty water irrigation decreases the amount of plant tissue water content thus the plant is forced to re adjust the stomatal aperture and reduce water loss which significantly reduces co2 availability and the accumulation of photosynthetic products assaha et al 2017 kamanga et al 2020 li et al 2022a in addition salty water contains many na and cl ions that may induce ion toxicity in the tomato plant causing a decrease in plant chloroplast content and interfering with the photochemical system thereby reducing yield aroca and ruiz lozano 2012 li et al 2022a 2022c yang et al 2018 therefore there is a strong negative correlation between tomato yield and salty water sodium adsorption ratio p 0 001 fig s5 in short the greater the ec and sodium adsorption ratio of the irrigation water the greater the yield decline at the same time decreased yields lead to decreased iwue yield irrigation water moreover high fertilizer input increased tomato yield under salty water irrigation fig s5 probably by alleviating salt stress for example potassium fertilizer regulates k na in tomato plants thereby alleviating osmotic stress and ion toxicity cao et al 2019 yurtseven et al 2005 tss usually includes total sugars oa antioxidants and other trace substances in tomato pulp which is an essential indicator of tomato quality beckles 2012 generally abiotic stresses drought and salt stress decrease water content in tomato thus increasing tss content and improving tomato fruit quality wu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the increase in tomato tss in our study can be explained by salty water irrigation causing salt stress li et al 2022b a decrease in tomato fruit water content is beneficial for improving tss this hypothesis was supported by the positive correlation between tomato tss and the ec of irrigation water fig s4 which was also observed in other studies li et al 2022b 2019 yang et al 2018 in addition salt stress may be mitigated by adding potassium and phosphate fertilizers but this decreases tomato tss yurtseven et al 2005 studies have shown that under long term salt stress ion toxicity to plants is significantly increased excessive cations accumulate in plants and tomato produces excessive oas to maintain the ph and ion balance inside the fruit resulting in increased acidity cuartero and fernández muñoz 1998 at the same time as an essential part of the signaling pathway soluble sugars control the metabolism of plants and maintain osmotic balance therefore during salt stress aba acts through the breakdown of starch into sugars thereby producing more soluble sugars to maintain the balance of osmotic regulation in cells and prevent cell damage julkowska and testerink 2015 li et al 2019 zhai et al 2015 both oa and ss increased under salty water irrigation but ss increased more than oa resulting in an increased sar previous studies have shown that salty water irrigation increases vc which is consistent with our results li et al 2019 yan et al 2021 zhai et al 2015 the tomatoes developed high vc under salty water irrigation because they produce many reactive oxygen species under salt stress leading to higher levels of antioxidants lycopene vc in tomatoes shalata and tal 1998 sharma et al 2012 however as the salinity of the irrigation water continued to increase tomato vc did not significantly increase high salt stress increases the production of reactive oxygen species causing oxidative stress in plants leading to lipid peroxidation and active inhibition of key metabolic enzymes kamanga et al 2018 sharma and dubey 2005 in summary tomatoes stabilize osmotic potential under salt stress by increasing the osmotic regulator and mitigating oxidative stress by increasing antioxidants 4 2 effects of cultivation measures on tomato yield iwue and fruit quality under salty water irrigation the yield decline of field grown tomato was significantly lower than that of greenhouse grown tomato fig 2 this trend is related to greenhouse characteristics as highlighted in a recent meta analysis higher temperatures in the greenhouse than in the field under different levels of nitrogen supply may shorten the growth period of tomato plants which is not conducive for the increase of tomato yield cheng et al 2021b in addition high humidity environment in the greenhouse leads to a lower vapor pressure deficit and may reduce the accumulation of ca2 in leaves and reduce leaf area index gong et al 2022 shamshiri et al 2018 ca2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of plant ion transport and maintenance of cell wall stability plant na ca2 ratio can be used to indicate plant salt tolerance and a high na ca2 ratio increases salt injury and decreases cell protective enzyme activities cao et al 2019 as described before reduced ca2 accumulation in the plant leads to increased na ca2 ratio and salt injury which may indirectly influence tomato yield therefore for the same irrigation salinity the tomato yield was lower in the greenhouse than in the field according to the calculated iwue the greenhouse yield was lower than the field yield resulting in higher field iwue than greenhouse iwue therefore the changing trends in iwue and yield among cultivation site subgroups were consistent at the same time reduced salt tolerance increases osmotic pressure resulting in reduced tomato water content and increased tss despite that there were no significant differences in tomato oa between the field and greenhouse tomatoes high sar was observed in the field tomato this may be due to increased na ca2 and decreased cell protective enzyme activities in greenhouse tomatoes wang et al 2021 generally salty water irrigation resulted in salt accumulation on the soil surface forcing the tomato to produce more ss to maintain cell osmotic balance to ensure the integrity of the cell membrane cao et al 2019 however decreased cell protective enzyme activity in greenhouse grown tomatoes may inhibit ss and vc production hence with an increase in irrigation water ec the field tomato sar and vc were higher than those in the greenhouse tomatoes moreover leaf area index was reduced under greenhouse conditions which did not favor the accumulation of vc lu et al 2019 drip irrigation is beneficial for salty water irrigation of tomatoes a few studies have suggested that plant root growth is slow or even stop when soil water availability is high hu et al 2021 especially in furrow irrigation where excessive water inputs are not conducive for promoting the vitality and growth of tomato roots or plant resistance to salinity stress colmer and voesenek 2009 hu et al 2021 liu et al 2020 ultimately this results in a greater decline in yield in contrast drip irrigation increases root biomass through slight water stress induced redistribution of plant photosynthetic products which increases plant resistance to stressful conditions hu et al 2021 on the other hand drip irrigation has uniform continuous and accurate characteristics including the maintenance of favorable moisture conditions that reduces salinity around the root system and mitigates salt stress cheng et al 2021a 2021d in addition soil nitrogen is easily removed from the surface with the majority accumulating in the deep soil layer hu et al 2021 hence the confined root systems of tomato plants may face decreased coordination of water and nutrient transport under furrow irrigation resulting in lower yield in short drip irrigation provides more stable tomato yields under salty water irrigation than under furrow irrigation because drip irrigation caused slight water stress to tomatoes a decrease in the water supply increased tss under drip irrigation compared with furrow irrigation guichard et al 2001 the effect of continuous cropping on tomato yield cannot be ignored but no significant differences in tomato quality tss oa sar and vc were observed in this study with increasing planting years reduction in yield gradually decreased this trend was observed in both sub humid and semi arid regions chen et al 2009 li et al 2022a this may be because long term salt stress selects for stress tolerant microorganisms and alters the microbial community structure in soil the succession of microbial community increases soil productivity dini andreote et al 2014 yan et al 2015 and may indirectly increase tomato yield this phenomenon has been observed in salt marshes and under drought conditions dini andreote et al 2014 malik et al 2020 on the other hand when soil salinity is always in a dynamic balance of accumulation and leaching the tomato yield may not decrease with the increase of planting years and may even increase slightly li et al 2022a 4 3 effects of soil properties on tomato yield iwue and fruit quality salty water irrigation increases the soil sodium adsorption ratio and sodium percentage yan et al 2021 resulting in increased proportion of fine capillaries decreased proportion of macropores and changes in soil structural characteristics bijani and hayati 2011 li et al 2018 thereby inhibiting plant root growth and water absorption and leading to a decline in yield this negative effect is strong in fine soils and relatively small in coarse soils however iwue is lower in coarse soil potentially due to its poor water holding capacity with more water needed to achieve the same yield obtained in fine and medium soils cheng et al 2021c in addition the salt leaching rate was low in fine and medium soils wang et al 2016 with more salt ions accumulating in the root zone and on the soil surface causing a decline in soil water potential and limiting water absorption by tomato roots in turn this leads to a decline in water supply through the phloem to the fruit promoting an increase in tomato tss wu et al 2022 the tomato fruit oa showed no significant difference in the subgroup soil texture under saline water ec 8 ds m 1 however a significant difference was observed in the tomato sar fig 6 the reason for this could be poor soil aeration in medium soil compared with coarse soil which reduced photosynthesis sugar metabolism and tomato ss in addition weakly alkaline soil was beneficial for absorption of nutrients by tomato roots and the release of soil nutrients leading to a significantly increased yield and iwue compared with acidic soil holland et al 2018 high soil bulk density increases soil compaction and is not conducive for leaching of salts thereby limiting water absorption by plant roots reducing water content of tomato and increasing their tss cheng et al 2021b however with the increase in irrigation water ec variable interacting factors including irrigation water ec sodium adsorption ratio and soil bulk density may lead to a decrease in tss similarly in high bulk density soils with higher salt ion accumulation increased ion toxicity and osmotic stress resulting in an increased oa production by tomatoes maintain cell internal environment stability rana et al 2008 sahab et al 2021 in addition higher ion toxicity and osmotic stress in high soil bulk density soil decreases the stomatal opening in tomato produces more oxygen free radicals and prompts tomatoes to produce more vc cheng et al 2021b however soil bulk density did not significantly affect tomato yield p 0 63 and iwue p 0 15 fig s5 fig s6 soil organic matter content plays a vital role in salt stress it supports the retention and release of ions in the soil maintains tomato plant k na and ca2 na ratios and reduces ionic toxicity leading to increased tomato yield cao et al 2019 therefore increasing som content may effectively increase yield p 0 015 and iwue p 0 43 under salty water irrigation fig s5 fig s6 additionally reduced ionic toxicity may have contributed to the decline in tomato oa fig s8 and improved sar fig 6 moreover ionic toxicity was reduced under som content 1 5 which favored the increase in leaf area of tomato plants thereby increasing light intensity and accumulation of vc cao et al 2019 4 4 effects of temperature on yield iwue and quality of tomato mat significantly affects metabolism yield and quality of tomato harel et al 2014 higher mat generally improved tomato yield water use efficiency and quality however under salty water irrigation higher temperatures cause rapid evaporation of water from soil resulting in the accumulation of salts on the soil surface this exacerbates salt stress leading to decreased tomato yield and iwue eswar et al 2021 in a meta analysis by cheng et al 2021b it was found that low temperatures were beneficial for oa accumulation which was consistent with the results of salty water irrigation observed in this study this may be due to a low temperature induced increase in vacuolar malic acid accumulation gautier et al 2008 however from irrigation with water of similar salinity the salt stress produced at mat 12 c was more significant than at mat 12 c which eventually led to increased ss in plants in moderately saline water irrigation the change in tomato sar was remarkable at mat 12 compared to mat 12 due to increased ss accumulation under high salt stress ripoll et al 2014 although tomato vc was not significantly different at different mat it exhibited positive correlation p 0 005 fig s9 on the one hand temperature increases fruit irradiance thereby increasing the vc content on the other hand high temperatures promote salt accumulation on the soil surface and strong salt stress causes the stomata to close causing plants to produce more antioxidants to neutralize free radicals although temperature had different effects on the tomato quality indicators it had no significant effect on tomato tss fig 4 4 5 limitations of the current study this meta analysis investigated the responses of tomato yield iwue and quality to salty water irrigation under different cultivation measures soil characteristics and temperatures however owing to limited availability of salty water data the effects of the seven factors cultivation site soil texture etc on tomato quality and iwue under salty water irrigation could not be analyzed in some cases the qualities considered in this study only included tomato tss oa sar and vc analysis of tomato ss mainly relied on the changes in oa and sar because of insufficient data at the same time the impact of these seven factors on the properties of commercial tomato color hardness and shape index storage species and umbilical rot under salty water irrigation require further research in addition analysis of the potential mechanisms of microbial community succession in extreme environments to improve soil productivity may be beneficial for alleviating the negative effects of saline water irrigation on tomatoes 5 conclusion the effects of salty water irrigation on tomato yield and quality were well pronounced overall suitable irrigation water for tomato production should have ec 8 ds m 1 compared to fresh water a slight decrease in tomato yield was observed under brackish water irrigation whereas tomato quality was enhanced under moderately saline water irrigation overall field production soil ph 7 and drip irrigation were strongly recommended to achieve optimal tomato yield and quality using brackish and moderately saline water irrigation in addition for brackish water irrigation medium soil was more suitable for tomato production whereas for moderately saline water coarse soil was more conducive for tomato production increasing som content reduces the negative effects of salty water irrigation mat 12 c under salty water irrigation was beneficial for tomato production since yield decreased less and iwue increased with increasing planting years the reduction in tomato yield gradually decreased this study provides essential practical insights for using saline water for tomato irrigation and would be beneficial for decision makers in making wise decisions

9024,the scarcity of freshwater resources has suppressed the sustainable development of agriculture especially tomato production adopting salty water irrigation is considered a promising strategy for alleviating the scarcity of freshwater resources however the effects of salty water electrical conductivity ec and cultivation conditions on tomato yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and fruit quality remain unclear in this study we conducted a meta analysis based on 1230 data pairs from 56 research papers reporting these aspects of tomato production overall salty water irrigation significantly decreased tomato yield 26 15 and iwue 24 65 and increased total soluble solids 13 68 organic acids 13 78 sugar and acid ratio 8 04 and vitamin c 9 78 compared to freshwater irrigation reduction in tomato yield and iwue increased with salty water ec brackish ec 3 ds m 1 and moderately saline water 3 ec 8 ds m 1 were recommended considering their greater potential to maintain both yield and quality though soil bulk density had no significant effect on tomato yield the soil with high bulk density was beneficial for improving tomato quality increasing soil organic matter reduces the negative effects of salty water irrigation a win win analysis showed that brackish and moderately saline water were suitable for drip irrigation and alkaline soils these results will be beneficial to maintain high yields and fruit quality in tomato production using salty water irrigation graphical abstract ga1 keywords meta analysis salty water tomato yield tomato fruit quality irrigation water use efficiency data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the shortage of freshwater resources due to climate change and population growth is one of the major problems faced globally particularly in agriculture aljohani 2017 cheng et al 2021a pan et al 2020 it is estimated that more than 70 of fresh water is used for agricultural production however this is not sufficient to meet the increasing demand for agricultural water particularly in arid and semi arid regions such as northwest china egypt and saudi arabia chen et al 2021 the irrigation water shortage has been aggravated by the increased intensity and frequency of drought events due to global climate change chen et al 2021 therefore adopting new water resource management strategies is an effective means to ensure optimum agricultural productivity seawater desalination and efficient use of salty water are crucial for alleviating the escalating water shortage pan et al 2020 however seawater desalination is impractical for solving the water crisis in inland areas as transportation is prohibitively expensive cheng et al 2021a pan et al 2020 therefore to alleviate the freshwater resource scarcity developing appropriate irrigation strategies using salty water is a pressing challenge currently the tomato fruit is abundant in nutrients including vitamin c vc and lycopene which potentially prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and cancer lu et al 2012 it is one of the most preferred edibles and widely cultivated vegetables worldwide cheng et al 2017 du et al 2018 however due to freshwater shortages the gap between tomato supply and demand has increased although several water saving irrigation methods have been explored water shortage remains a considerable challenge restricting sustainable tomato production lu et al 2021 therefore salty water irrigation can be a crucial strategy to alleviate the pressure of water shortages to a large extent cheng et al 2021a salty water has been used worldwide for hundreds of years and recognized in different regions of 17 countries cheng et al 2021a li et al 2019 although irrigation with salty water has been reported to reduce tomato yield fruit quality improvement is remarkable and can still be widely accepted li et al 2022a yan et al 2021 however conditions for salty water irrigation in tomato production on a global scale lack systematic analysis hence it is crucial to unveil the impact of salty water irrigation on tomato yield and quality which is also effective in coping with uncertain water resources and developing scientific agricultural salty water irrigation there are still some issues associated with salty water application such as introduction of salts to soils more salt ions cause salt stress to the tomato plant cheng et al 2021a li et al 2022b on one hand salt stress decreases soil water potential and changes in osmotic potential between soil and root cells lead to inhibited root water uptake and damage to tomato cells li et al 2022b on the other hand under salt stress the concentration of na and cl in plants increases and induce ion toxicity in tomato which may inhibit photosynthesis li et al 2022b shahid et al 2020 specifically salt stress and ion toxicity triggers a rapid increase of endogenous abscisic acid aba production in the plant which further regulates stomatal closure thereby affecting the accumulation of photosynthetic products leading to a decline in yield cheng et al 2021a li et al 2022a at the same time to protect plants from salt stress and maintain cellular integrity the osmotic adjustment system creates more osmotic adjustment substances soluble sugar ss free proline gao et al 2019 during salty water irrigation tomato fruit showed increased organic acid oa content which seems to counterbalance the excess na to maintain internal ph and ionic balance cuartero and fernández muñoz 1998 wang et al 2011 additionally salt stress exacerbates chloroplast production of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical resulting in oxidative stress zhu 2016 tomato has a complex system of antioxidants that produces more antioxidant substances such as vc and lycopene which maintain a reducing environment in the cells cui et al 2014 hou et al 2020 ripoll et al 2014 together oa ss and vc can significantly change tomato fruit taste and quality however the impact of salty water irrigation on tomato quality and yield remains controversial for example in comparison to freshwater irrigation several studies have reported no decline in tomato yield and no significant increase in total soluble solids tss during salty water irrigation choudhary et al 2010 zayton et al 2009 zhai et al 2016 these results can be attributed to differences in irrigation water electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio soil characteristics climate characteristics cultivation sites and planting years li et al 2019 thus the effects of salty water irrigation on tomato yield and quality are complex however a comprehensive review and quantitative analysis of salty water irrigation on tomato yield and quality is yet to be conducted this limits the development of strategies for salty water irrigation in tomato production specifically developing a plan for appropriate salty water irrigation conditions to improve tomato yield and quality is a crucial issue that needs to be addressed meta analysis is widely used in qualitative and quantitative assessments of multiple independent studies on a subject therefore it is a reliable and scientific statistical model that is commonly used in agricultural research cheng et al 2021a du et al 2018 researchers have used meta analysis to evaluate the effects of deficit irrigation on crop yield nitrogen supply on tomato yield and salty water irrigation on crop yield which are essential for cost saving in agricultural production cheng et al 2021a 2021c du et al 2018 however a previous meta analysis focused on the yield and water productivity of tomato wheat cotton and other crops under saline water irrigation cheng et al 2021a a meta analysis of tomato quality indicators is still lacking furthermore previous studies did not consider the influence of different cultivation sites and planting years on tomato yield cheng et al 2021a therefore in this study we conducted a global meta analysis of the effects of salty water irrigation on tomato yield and fruit quality this analysis aimed to identify and quantify the effects of salty water irrigation on tomato yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and fruit quality the results suggest that further comprehensive utilization of salty water is required to alleviate freshwater resource crisis 2 materials and

m 1 moderately saline water 3 ec 8 ds m 1 and saline water ec 8 ds m 1 cheng et al 2021a paranychianakis and chartzoulakis 2005 2 2 data analysis response ratio lnrr was calculated using the metafor package 3 8 1 in r to analyze and integrate the collected tomato yield iwue and tomato quality data lnrr was used to reflect the influence of salty water irrigation on each variable value the calculation formula is as follows eq 1 1 ln rr ln x e ln x c where x e represents the average yield quality and iwue of tomato under salty water irrigation and x c represents average yield quality and iwue under fresh water irrigation tong et al 2022 the variance of lnrr was calculated by eq 2 2 v s e 2 n e x e 2 s c 2 n c x e 2 where n e and n c represent the experimental and control groups sample numbers respectively and s e and s c represent the standard deviation of the experimental and control groups respectively benítez lópez et al 2017 the weighted method was used to calculate the average response ratio to eliminate the unequal variation as much as possible eqs 3 4 3 ln rr i 1 k w i ln rr i 1 k w i 4 w i 1 v in the formula k represents the number of studies w i represents the weight of the independent research of the ith experiment and the variance var lnrr and 95 confidence interval 95 ci were calculated by using the following formulas respectively eqs 5 6 5 var ln r r 1 i 1 k w i

zero there was no significant effect of salty water irrigation on the variable if the 95 confidence interval was more than zero there was a significant positive effect under salty water irrigation on the variable sha et al 2021 finally to facilitate the interpretation of the results the following percentage change was used eq 7 7 percentage change rr 1 100 the ggplot package of the r software was used to complete the frequency distribution map effect size and forest map 2 3 publication bias test the i2 values represent heterogeneity between the data pairs in general i2 50 was considered as low heterogeneity and the fixed effect model was used to calculate the response ratio by contrast the random effects model was used tong et al 2022 in our study the yield iwue tss oa sar and vc showed high heterogeneity table s1 therefore the random effects model was used to calculate the response ratio this may affect the results of the meta analysis when there is a publication bias therefore we used a funnel plot and rosenthal fail safe number nf to determine any publication bias if the funnel plot is symmetric there is no publication bias irwig et al 1998 if nf 5 n 10 n is the sample size of the effect then there was no publication bias and the greater the value the more robust the results adu et al 2018 the results showed that the funnel plots of tomato yield tss oa sar vc and iwue were symmetrical the nf of yield tss oa sar vc and iwue were greater than 5 n 10 table s1 in general the meta analysis results were stable and reliable without any publication bias 3 results 3 1 effects of salty water irrigation on tomato yield the results of this study showed that salty water irrigation strongly affected tomato yield fig 1 tomato yield changes were significantly different among the three irrigation salinities by contrast brackish water irrigation showed the least decline 12 9 95 ci 16 60 to 9 04 fig 1 in brackish water irrigation the tomato yield was significantly affected by the cultivation sites and mat fig 2 for example a significant decrease in yield in the greenhouse 23 68 95 ci 31 40 to 15 08 and mat 12 18 16 95 ci 25 74 to 9 81 were observed compared to the controls fig 2 under moderately saline water irrigation only the soil bulk density had an insignificant effect on tomato yield fig 2 f we observed a lesser reduction in tomato yield in the field 25 11 95 ci 27 89 to 22 23 under drip irrigation 22 32 95 ci 24 63 to 19 94 in the third planting year 9 93 95 ci 13 78 to 5 90 in coarse soils 22 80 95 ci 25 71 to 19 79 under soil ph 7 22 53 95 ci 24 46 to 20 56 under som content 1 5 17 44 95 ci 19 50 to 15 32 and with mat 12 6 54 95 ci 11 49 to 1 31 fig 2 notably with increasing planting years the reduction in tomato yield gradually decreased under brackish water and moderately saline water irrigation fig 2c for brackish water irrigation the tomato yield showed no significant difference in the third planting year 7 44 95 ci 15 86 1 83 compared to the controls fig 2c under saline water irrigation only the cultivation sites and som content had a significant effect on tomato yield fig 2 tomato yield in the greenhouse 67 15 95 ci 72 27 to 61 10 was generally lower than in the field 43 66 95 ci 56 51 to 27 02 interestingly soil bulk density showed an insignificant effect on tomato yield p 0 631 irrespective of the irrigation water ec fig 2 f fig s5 in addition the salty water sodium adsorption ratio was significantly negatively correlated with tomato yield fig s5 3 2 effects of salty water irrigation on iwue of tomato the iwue declined as the ec of the irrigation water increased fig s4 the iwue was not significantly different between brackish water irrigation 16 77 95 ci 42 22 19 88 and the control treatment fig 1 as shown in fig 3 under brackish water irrigation the response of iwue was significantly affected by cultivation site soil texture soil ph and mat for example we observed a significant decreasing tendency of iwue under the greenhouse 76 42 95 ci 89 42 to 47 47 coarse soils 68 68 95 ci 86 40 to 27 84 soil ph 7 76 42 95 ci 89 42 to 47 47 and mat 12 32 38 95 ci 59 27 12 23 compared to the control treatment by contrast iwue was significantly higher under field cultivation medium soil soil ph 7 som content 1 5 soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 and mat 12 compared to the controls treatment fig 3 under moderately saline water irrigation different mat significantly affected iwue mat 12 31 35 95 ci 14 13 51 16 was beneficial for the increase in iwue fig 3h fig 3 shows that iwue increased in the third planting year compared with the first and second planting years and iwue was significantly higher in medium soils than in coarse soils notably the cultivation site soil bulk density som content and irrigation method did not significantly affect iwue in moderately saline water irrigation fig 3 3 3 effects of salty water irrigation on tomato quality the tss content of tomato fruits increased linearly with irrigation water ec fig s4 but there was no significant difference in tss between different irrigation water salinities fig 1 we also showed that the irrigation water sodium adsorption ratio did not significantly affect tss fig s7 the cultivation sites and irrigation methods could significantly affect tomato tss under brackish water irrigation fig 4 for example a greater increase in tomato tss was observed in the groups of greenhouse 20 29 95 ci 16 36 24 35 and drip irrigation 14 42 95 ci 10 70 18 27 subgroups compared to controls fig 4 notably planting year soil texture soil ph som content soil bulk density and mat had insignificant effects on tomato tss under brackish water irrigation fig 4 however under moderately saline irrigation tomato tss was not significantly different among any of the subgroups fig 4 similar trends in tomato tss were observed with respect to the cultivation site irrigation method planting years soil texture and soil bulk density under brackish water and moderate saline water irrigation fig 4 finally subgroup analysis showed that the increases in tss in medium 42 38 95 ci 21 99 66 17 and low bulk density soils 19 48 95 ci 11 23 28 35 were higher under saline water irrigation fig 4 compared with the control treatment salty water irrigation significantly increased the oa of the tomato fruits fig 1 overall soil ph p 0 03 soil bulk density p 0 01 and som content p 0 004 were significantly negatively correlated with the tomato fruit oa content fig s8 however under brackish water irrigation only soil bulk density was found to significantly influence tomato oa content fig 5 a more significant increase in tomato oa content was observed in the groups of soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 15 35 95 ci 10 86 20 02 compared to the control treatment fig 5f however the tomato oa content with respect to planting years mat som content and soil bulk density were observed to have the same trend under brackish water and moderately saline water irrigation fig 5 namely a more significant increase in tomato oa content was observed in the groups with respect to planting years third mat 12 som content 1 5 and soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 compared to the control treatment fig 5 finally tomato oa content in medium soil was significantly higher than that in coarse soil under saline water irrigation fig 5d overall when irrigation water ec was 8 ds m 1 the tomato sar increased with increasing irrigation water ec and was the highest under moderately saline water irrigation fig 1 in brackish water irrigation it is noteworthy that while other subgroups had different degrees of effect on tomato sar we observed significant differences only within the soil texture subgroup fig 6 under brackish water irrigation tomato sar in coarse soils 5 19 ci 1 92 8 56 was significantly higher than that in the control treatment while tomato sar in medium soils 4 59 ci 8 33 to 0 70 was significantly lower than that in the control treatment fig 6d tomato sar with respect to different soil textures som and mat content showed significant differences under moderately saline irrigation fig 6 among these subgroups tomato sar showed greater increase with coarse soils 9 10 95 ci 6 34 11 93 som content 1 5 27 18 95 ci 21 92 32 66 and mat 12 27 18 95 ci 21 92 32 66 compared to the control treatment fig 6 the trend of variation of vc was different from that of tss or oa vc varied quadratically with increasing irrigation water ec fig 1 moderately saline water irrigation had the least effect on the change in vc 5 87 95 ci 0 90 11 07 fig 1 under brackish water vc was significantly different among the som subgroups fig 7 moderately saline water irrigation differed significantly in tomato vc among the cultivation sites and soil bulk density subgroups fig 7 it increased vc in the field and soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 groups by 19 26 95 ci 11 87 27 13 and 24 92 95 ci 18 27 31 93 respectively fig 7 under brackish water or moderately saline water irrigation the tomato fruit vc increased with increasing soil bulk density and som 3 4 best application area of salty water irrigation although irrigation with salty water reduced tomato yield it improved tss oa sar and vc previous studies have demonstrated that increased tomato tss oa sar and vc represents better tomato quality cuartero and fernández muñoz 1998 a win win analysis was conducted to formulate irrigation strategy for salty water tong et al 2022 the tomato yield and tss oa vc effect sizes were divided into different zones according to the average yield effect size and the zero scale as shown in fig 8 five zones were divided with zone a representing irrigation with salty water with a positive effect on tomato yield and tomato fruit quality thus zone a was the target area conversely in zone d salty water irrigation had a negative effect on tomato yield and tomato fruit quality zone b showed that salty water irrigation caused yield decline but was within the average effect size with positive impact on tomato fruit quality therefore zone b was considered acceptable the results indicated that 66 86 59 09 and 54 44 of the samples fell into zones a and b for yield tss yield oa and yield vc respectively fig 8 these samples were the focus of this study at the same time a part of the samples fell into zone c fig 8 where the yield effect sizes were less than average therefore subsequent analysis was not considered further analyses included effects of irrigation water ec soil texture planting years and other factors for the samples in zones a and b the results showed that the percentages of brackish water were significantly higher than those of moderately saline water and saline water table 1 in zones a and b the proportions of drip irrigation greenhouse alkaline soil soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 and mat 12 were larger table 1 the percentages of soil texture were similar among the coarse soils and medium soils the win win analysis did not include tomato fruit sar due to the small sample size 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation water ec on tomato yield iwue and quality the meta analysis demonstrated a strong negative correlation between tomato yield and irrigation water ec fig s4 obviously irrigation with salty water lead to negative effects on tomato yield soil salts increase under salty water irrigation leading to a decline in soil water potential and suppressed plant root ability to obtain soil water due to the osmotic effects despite increased soil water with increased irrigation depth the soil water potential declines making tomato root water absorption challenging causing a decline in soil water availability therefore there was no significant correlation between tomato yield and salty water irrigation depth p 0 086 fig s5 moreover salt stress due to salty water irrigation decreases the amount of plant tissue water content thus the plant is forced to re adjust the stomatal aperture and reduce water loss which significantly reduces co2 availability and the accumulation of photosynthetic products assaha et al 2017 kamanga et al 2020 li et al 2022a in addition salty water contains many na and cl ions that may induce ion toxicity in the tomato plant causing a decrease in plant chloroplast content and interfering with the photochemical system thereby reducing yield aroca and ruiz lozano 2012 li et al 2022a 2022c yang et al 2018 therefore there is a strong negative correlation between tomato yield and salty water sodium adsorption ratio p 0 001 fig s5 in short the greater the ec and sodium adsorption ratio of the irrigation water the greater the yield decline at the same time decreased yields lead to decreased iwue yield irrigation water moreover high fertilizer input increased tomato yield under salty water irrigation fig s5 probably by alleviating salt stress for example potassium fertilizer regulates k na in tomato plants thereby alleviating osmotic stress and ion toxicity cao et al 2019 yurtseven et al 2005 tss usually includes total sugars oa antioxidants and other trace substances in tomato pulp which is an essential indicator of tomato quality beckles 2012 generally abiotic stresses drought and salt stress decrease water content in tomato thus increasing tss content and improving tomato fruit quality wu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the increase in tomato tss in our study can be explained by salty water irrigation causing salt stress li et al 2022b a decrease in tomato fruit water content is beneficial for improving tss this hypothesis was supported by the positive correlation between tomato tss and the ec of irrigation water fig s4 which was also observed in other studies li et al 2022b 2019 yang et al 2018 in addition salt stress may be mitigated by adding potassium and phosphate fertilizers but this decreases tomato tss yurtseven et al 2005 studies have shown that under long term salt stress ion toxicity to plants is significantly increased excessive cations accumulate in plants and tomato produces excessive oas to maintain the ph and ion balance inside the fruit resulting in increased acidity cuartero and fernández muñoz 1998 at the same time as an essential part of the signaling pathway soluble sugars control the metabolism of plants and maintain osmotic balance therefore during salt stress aba acts through the breakdown of starch into sugars thereby producing more soluble sugars to maintain the balance of osmotic regulation in cells and prevent cell damage julkowska and testerink 2015 li et al 2019 zhai et al 2015 both oa and ss increased under salty water irrigation but ss increased more than oa resulting in an increased sar previous studies have shown that salty water irrigation increases vc which is consistent with our results li et al 2019 yan et al 2021 zhai et al 2015 the tomatoes developed high vc under salty water irrigation because they produce many reactive oxygen species under salt stress leading to higher levels of antioxidants lycopene vc in tomatoes shalata and tal 1998 sharma et al 2012 however as the salinity of the irrigation water continued to increase tomato vc did not significantly increase high salt stress increases the production of reactive oxygen species causing oxidative stress in plants leading to lipid peroxidation and active inhibition of key metabolic enzymes kamanga et al 2018 sharma and dubey 2005 in summary tomatoes stabilize osmotic potential under salt stress by increasing the osmotic regulator and mitigating oxidative stress by increasing antioxidants 4 2 effects of cultivation measures on tomato yield iwue and fruit quality under salty water irrigation the yield decline of field grown tomato was significantly lower than that of greenhouse grown tomato fig 2 this trend is related to greenhouse characteristics as highlighted in a recent meta analysis higher temperatures in the greenhouse than in the field under different levels of nitrogen supply may shorten the growth period of tomato plants which is not conducive for the increase of tomato yield cheng et al 2021b in addition high humidity environment in the greenhouse leads to a lower vapor pressure deficit and may reduce the accumulation of ca2 in leaves and reduce leaf area index gong et al 2022 shamshiri et al 2018 ca2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of plant ion transport and maintenance of cell wall stability plant na ca2 ratio can be used to indicate plant salt tolerance and a high na ca2 ratio increases salt injury and decreases cell protective enzyme activities cao et al 2019 as described before reduced ca2 accumulation in the plant leads to increased na ca2 ratio and salt injury which may indirectly influence tomato yield therefore for the same irrigation salinity the tomato yield was lower in the greenhouse than in the field according to the calculated iwue the greenhouse yield was lower than the field yield resulting in higher field iwue than greenhouse iwue therefore the changing trends in iwue and yield among cultivation site subgroups were consistent at the same time reduced salt tolerance increases osmotic pressure resulting in reduced tomato water content and increased tss despite that there were no significant differences in tomato oa between the field and greenhouse tomatoes high sar was observed in the field tomato this may be due to increased na ca2 and decreased cell protective enzyme activities in greenhouse tomatoes wang et al 2021 generally salty water irrigation resulted in salt accumulation on the soil surface forcing the tomato to produce more ss to maintain cell osmotic balance to ensure the integrity of the cell membrane cao et al 2019 however decreased cell protective enzyme activity in greenhouse grown tomatoes may inhibit ss and vc production hence with an increase in irrigation water ec the field tomato sar and vc were higher than those in the greenhouse tomatoes moreover leaf area index was reduced under greenhouse conditions which did not favor the accumulation of vc lu et al 2019 drip irrigation is beneficial for salty water irrigation of tomatoes a few studies have suggested that plant root growth is slow or even stop when soil water availability is high hu et al 2021 especially in furrow irrigation where excessive water inputs are not conducive for promoting the vitality and growth of tomato roots or plant resistance to salinity stress colmer and voesenek 2009 hu et al 2021 liu et al 2020 ultimately this results in a greater decline in yield in contrast drip irrigation increases root biomass through slight water stress induced redistribution of plant photosynthetic products which increases plant resistance to stressful conditions hu et al 2021 on the other hand drip irrigation has uniform continuous and accurate characteristics including the maintenance of favorable moisture conditions that reduces salinity around the root system and mitigates salt stress cheng et al 2021a 2021d in addition soil nitrogen is easily removed from the surface with the majority accumulating in the deep soil layer hu et al 2021 hence the confined root systems of tomato plants may face decreased coordination of water and nutrient transport under furrow irrigation resulting in lower yield in short drip irrigation provides more stable tomato yields under salty water irrigation than under furrow irrigation because drip irrigation caused slight water stress to tomatoes a decrease in the water supply increased tss under drip irrigation compared with furrow irrigation guichard et al 2001 the effect of continuous cropping on tomato yield cannot be ignored but no significant differences in tomato quality tss oa sar and vc were observed in this study with increasing planting years reduction in yield gradually decreased this trend was observed in both sub humid and semi arid regions chen et al 2009 li et al 2022a this may be because long term salt stress selects for stress tolerant microorganisms and alters the microbial community structure in soil the succession of microbial community increases soil productivity dini andreote et al 2014 yan et al 2015 and may indirectly increase tomato yield this phenomenon has been observed in salt marshes and under drought conditions dini andreote et al 2014 malik et al 2020 on the other hand when soil salinity is always in a dynamic balance of accumulation and leaching the tomato yield may not decrease with the increase of planting years and may even increase slightly li et al 2022a 4 3 effects of soil properties on tomato yield iwue and fruit quality salty water irrigation increases the soil sodium adsorption ratio and sodium percentage yan et al 2021 resulting in increased proportion of fine capillaries decreased proportion of macropores and changes in soil structural characteristics bijani and hayati 2011 li et al 2018 thereby inhibiting plant root growth and water absorption and leading to a decline in yield this negative effect is strong in fine soils and relatively small in coarse soils however iwue is lower in coarse soil potentially due to its poor water holding capacity with more water needed to achieve the same yield obtained in fine and medium soils cheng et al 2021c in addition the salt leaching rate was low in fine and medium soils wang et al 2016 with more salt ions accumulating in the root zone and on the soil surface causing a decline in soil water potential and limiting water absorption by tomato roots in turn this leads to a decline in water supply through the phloem to the fruit promoting an increase in tomato tss wu et al 2022 the tomato fruit oa showed no significant difference in the subgroup soil texture under saline water ec 8 ds m 1 however a significant difference was observed in the tomato sar fig 6 the reason for this could be poor soil aeration in medium soil compared with coarse soil which reduced photosynthesis sugar metabolism and tomato ss in addition weakly alkaline soil was beneficial for absorption of nutrients by tomato roots and the release of soil nutrients leading to a significantly increased yield and iwue compared with acidic soil holland et al 2018 high soil bulk density increases soil compaction and is not conducive for leaching of salts thereby limiting water absorption by plant roots reducing water content of tomato and increasing their tss cheng et al 2021b however with the increase in irrigation water ec variable interacting factors including irrigation water ec sodium adsorption ratio and soil bulk density may lead to a decrease in tss similarly in high bulk density soils with higher salt ion accumulation increased ion toxicity and osmotic stress resulting in an increased oa production by tomatoes maintain cell internal environment stability rana et al 2008 sahab et al 2021 in addition higher ion toxicity and osmotic stress in high soil bulk density soil decreases the stomatal opening in tomato produces more oxygen free radicals and prompts tomatoes to produce more vc cheng et al 2021b however soil bulk density did not significantly affect tomato yield p 0 63 and iwue p 0 15 fig s5 fig s6 soil organic matter content plays a vital role in salt stress it supports the retention and release of ions in the soil maintains tomato plant k na and ca2 na ratios and reduces ionic toxicity leading to increased tomato yield cao et al 2019 therefore increasing som content may effectively increase yield p 0 015 and iwue p 0 43 under salty water irrigation fig s5 fig s6 additionally reduced ionic toxicity may have contributed to the decline in tomato oa fig s8 and improved sar fig 6 moreover ionic toxicity was reduced under som content 1 5 which favored the increase in leaf area of tomato plants thereby increasing light intensity and accumulation of vc cao et al 2019 4 4 effects of temperature on yield iwue and quality of tomato mat significantly affects metabolism yield and quality of tomato harel et al 2014 higher mat generally improved tomato yield water use efficiency and quality however under salty water irrigation higher temperatures cause rapid evaporation of water from soil resulting in the accumulation of salts on the soil surface this exacerbates salt stress leading to decreased tomato yield and iwue eswar et al 2021 in a meta analysis by cheng et al 2021b it was found that low temperatures were beneficial for oa accumulation which was consistent with the results of salty water irrigation observed in this study this may be due to a low temperature induced increase in vacuolar malic acid accumulation gautier et al 2008 however from irrigation with water of similar salinity the salt stress produced at mat 12 c was more significant than at mat 12 c which eventually led to increased ss in plants in moderately saline water irrigation the change in tomato sar was remarkable at mat 12 compared to mat 12 due to increased ss accumulation under high salt stress ripoll et al 2014 although tomato vc was not significantly different at different mat it exhibited positive correlation p 0 005 fig s9 on the one hand temperature increases fruit irradiance thereby increasing the vc content on the other hand high temperatures promote salt accumulation on the soil surface and strong salt stress causes the stomata to close causing plants to produce more antioxidants to neutralize free radicals although temperature had different effects on the tomato quality indicators it had no significant effect on tomato tss fig 4 4 5 limitations of the current study this meta analysis investigated the responses of tomato yield iwue and quality to salty water irrigation under different cultivation measures soil characteristics and temperatures however owing to limited availability of salty water data the effects of the seven factors cultivation site soil texture etc on tomato quality and iwue under salty water irrigation could not be analyzed in some cases the qualities considered in this study only included tomato tss oa sar and vc analysis of tomato ss mainly relied on the changes in oa and sar because of insufficient data at the same time the impact of these seven factors on the properties of commercial tomato color hardness and shape index storage species and umbilical rot under salty water irrigation require further research in addition analysis of the potential mechanisms of microbial community succession in extreme environments to improve soil productivity may be beneficial for alleviating the negative effects of saline water irrigation on tomatoes 5 conclusion the effects of salty water irrigation on tomato yield and quality were well pronounced overall suitable irrigation water for tomato production should have ec 8 ds m 1 compared to fresh water a slight decrease in tomato yield was observed under brackish water irrigation whereas tomato quality was enhanced under moderately saline water irrigation overall field production soil ph 7 and drip irrigation were strongly recommended to achieve optimal tomato yield and quality using brackish and moderately saline water irrigation in addition for brackish water irrigation medium soil was more suitable for tomato production whereas for moderately saline water coarse soil was more conducive for tomato production increasing som content reduces the negative effects of salty water irrigation mat 12 c under salty water irrigation was beneficial for tomato production since yield decreased less and iwue increased with increasing planting years the reduction in tomato yield gradually decreased this study provides essential practical insights for using saline water for tomato irrigation and would be beneficial for decision makers in making wise decisions
