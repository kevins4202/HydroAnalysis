6815,a lagrangean particle based transport model is introduced to calculate the potential contamination paths of solutes in drainage water in an urban area during a pluvial flood event the necessity to capture the complexity of a surface runoff model and the coupling of pipe and surface are investigated results show that fully coupled hydrodynamic models are needed for a good representation of transport paths and breakthrough curves of contaminant concentration in drainage water an analysis for time variation of a single location spill event is performed that shows a high variability in solute spreading depending on the spill relative to the rainfall characteristics keywords hydrodynamic model lagrangean particles pollution risk map random walk surface water pollution 1 introduction pluvial floods due to strong rainfall events are an important topic in many cities as they can cause damage to infrastructure and endanger health of civilians jha et al 2012 damage is not only a consequence of water level outside and inside buildings but also of hazardous contaminants in the water rözer et al 2016 because the surface is widely sealed in urban areas the rainfall can only be drained via the surface and the subsurface pipe system due to exceeding pipe capacity water can be spilled to the surface through surcharged manholes thus the flow patterns and transport paths in drainage water can be very complex when compared to dry weather conditions many software tools are available for simulating the flood area of urban catchments after a heavy rainfall with physically based numerical models they use a combination of pipe network 1d and surface runoff 2d coupling to compute expected water levels ellis and viavattene 2014 based on the complexity of their physically based numerical model they solve pressurised flow and shallow water equations ettrich et al 2005 to calculate water depths and flow velocity in the pipe network and on the surface time dependent rainfall rates serve as input values examples for such 1d 2d coupled models are hystem extran 2d itwh 2010 mike flood danish hydraulic institute dhi group 2017 and infoworks icm innovyze 2018 apart from the flooding understanding transport of hazardous solute and forecasting pollution spreading is an important topic to protect urban areas from contamination pollution of storm water is a widely investigated topic when cities use a combined sewer system sewerage and rainfall is drained in the same pipes in this case the amount of sewerage is of interest to predict concentration of combined sewer overflow to rivers manholes can bring sewerage to the surface water when pipe capacity is exceeded thereby endangering human health mclellan et al 2007 depositing sediments of nutrients and heavy metals accumulate on the surface during dry weather periods they are washed off during rainfall as part of the storm water this type of accumulation is a widely spread source of water contamination vaze and chiew 2004 zhang et al 2017 traffic accidents and leaking barrels in industrial areas and private households may also lead to water contamination while such accidents are certainly rare the potential damage can be very high fast detection and forecasting can help to embank contaminant spreading and to plan fast decontamination of affected areas accidents with hazardous liquids are point sources and have to be treated differently from diffusive sources additionally the calculation must be accurate and fast for a forecast system this work focuses on modelling pollution transport after a point source spill event it should be noted that the model introduced in this paper could also be applied for the other cases too the 1d 2d coupled software tools provide time dependent flow velocities and exchange fluxes between pipe and surface water accurate models for solute transport in the pipe system and the surface domain are not provided by these tools at the current time if transport is included the models are based on an eulerian approach with element and grid based transport description for the pipe system there are several commercial and open source models that provide a calculation of sewerage concentration zoppou 2001 due to large element length the quality of concentration prediction is only good for sewerage transport where sources are diffusive for tracking single spills these models are not very accurate due to large elements furthermore not many models include a transport model for pollution in surface water a 2d pollution transport model was introduced by pathirana et al 2011 as an extension to the swmm model rossman 2010 combining it with the 2d surface flow model of begnudelli and sanders 2006 transport is based on a finite volume scheme which is locally and globally mass conservative in both domains each element is treated as well mixed over a length of several meters elliott and trowsdale 2007 with such large grid cells modelling the transport of single spill events is problematic due to the grid based eulerian method due to the numerical diffusion a decrease of the peak intensity and a widening of concentration breakthrough curves occur this can deteriorate predictions severely as dynamic transport paths require a good spatial resolution of the contaminant plume effects of numerical diffusion can be diminished via local mesh refinement and higher order schemes with slope limiter improvements benkhaldoun et al 2007 structure refinement and higher order schemes imply a high computational effort which make them computational costly and slow an alternative to an eulerian is the lagrangean approach which is not bound to a grid because all transport movement is described by individual particle kinematics ahlstrom et al 1977 used a random walk approach with particles representing an amount of mass to reproduce pollution transport in a mass conservative way when using a large number of particles with a lagrangean random walk approach the analytical solution of advective diffusive transport can be achieved hathhorn 1997 as an example lagrangean based particle transport models have been widely used in transport models in the subsurface on a pore scale blunt et al 2013 by applying advection dispersion movement of dissolved matter in one dimensional pore space networks fatt 1956 in this study we present a solute transport model that builds up on flow fields in a pipe network and on the surface calculated with eulerian based methods and uses a lagrangean random walk approach for mixing and dispersion pollution is tracked in the velocity field of pipe and surface flow to identify transport paths and to generate a risk map of particle accumulation after a point source spill event the model is used to study the impact of simplifications on the transport model time and location of contaminant sources are important information for a good prediction regarding water quality adequate resolution is required which might not be achieved by official measurements pan and ling 2017 volunteered geographical information vgi can be used to generate reports of spill events by civil users concepts of information gathering are divided into two groups characterized as a specific software e g smartphone application is provided to collect such data or filters are utilised to collect information from social media content and streams to extract water quality information some examples show the wide range of possibilities for flood level gathering from social media fohringer et al 2015 stream flow measurements with smartphones mazzoleni et al 2015 and image sampling of surface water breuer et al 2015 the quality of information and the localization is one of the most challenging problems when using vgi data poser and dransch 2010 for this reason an investigation of the impact on the accuracy of input information on the plume prediction is needed 2 transport model in this section the transport model used in the study is introduced it builds upon flow fields calculated with a hydrodynamic model 2 1 volume flow calculation the hydrodynamic 1d 2d numerical model hystem extran 2d itwh 2010 is used to generate surface and pipe flow velocity fields during a flash flood event for data input a rainfall time series is used precipitation is distributed equally over the entire area with intensity variation only in time the reason is that the test area is small enough for this approximation to be reasonable however the results of this study are not limited by this as the rainfall patterns are not crucial for the conclusions the flow field on the surface is calculated using a finite volume scheme solving the diffusive wave approximation of the shallow water equation source and sink terms link the surface flow to the pipe system in the pipe system a finite volume scheme is used to solve the st venant equations with friction slope calculation via manning strickler both schemes are solved using an explicit newton scheme for time integration and take the courant friedrich lévy criterion into account the advantage of finite volume discretization is global and local mass conservation this is an important requirement for not underestimating water levels during the forecast simulation dawson et al 2004 2 2 solute transport the transport of contaminants is modelled with a lagrangean approach assigning the mass of contaminant to a number of particles any chemical reaction sorption or other partitioning of the substance is neglected here the purpose of this study is the analysis of transport paths rather than the concentration values so that this simplification is justified an assumption for this model is that the additional volume of an added substance is neglected thus a spilled solute that contaminates the water during a strong rainfall event does not change the flow field itself the advection diffusion equation 1 c t v t c d 2 c describing the change of concentration c m l 3 over time t t with the advection velocity v l t 1 and the diffusion coefficient d l 2 t 1 is solved with a random walk approach kinzelbach 1988 in the pipe network domain each particle s position x is moved along the pipe axis based on the underlying advective velocity v on the surface the particles are moved according to velocity vectors that are interpolated from the computational grid points to the location of the particles the movement of the particles with flow velocity over one time step δ t capture the advective transport if the pipe system has a junction point where drainage water is directed in different outgoing directions e g spill to surface the particles are directed proportional to the fluxes this method is also applied for the re entry points on the surface particles can not enter the pipe system if street inlets and manholes are blocked mixing is included as a random walk turbulent mixing is assumed to be the most important process in the random walk step time discretised movement of each particle is randomly distributed by a gaussian normal distributed variable λ ahlstrom et al 1977 the total movement of a particle according to eq 1 with this explicit eulerian approach is 2 x t δ t x t v x t δ t 2 d δ t λ turbulent diffusion is scaled by the diffusion coefficient d which has a magnitude of 2 m 2 s inside the pipe system based on an assumption in schlütter et al 2003 for sewer systems turbulent diffusion in urban surface water was not found to be discussed in the literature so far based on lin and falconer 1997 who described mixing in near shore tidal flow models the coefficient has a magnitude of 0 01 m 2 s which is one order of magnitude higher than in the approach of fischer et al 1968 for turbulent diffusion in river streams the value of 0 01 m 2 s is used here because additional circumstances might increase mixing in surface water during a strong rainfall event for example wind induced circulation rain drop impact or passing car tires might lead to additional mixing in ponds of surface water with an unknown magnitude of the diffusion coefficient a cloud of particles is placed into the water at each point source spill location each particle gets an equal part of the total injection mass since particles do not represent a volume concentration of solutes cannot be calculated directly from particles it has to be computed from the relation of particles mass and the surrounding water volume the number of particles leads to a limitation of concentration resolution at the end of each time step each particle s position is used to select the containing cell element from the surface grid or the pipe element in the subsurface domain the particles masses are summarised in this cell water volume is calculated from water level and cell area solute concentration is computed for each cell by dividing total mass by water volume for each time step the mass and solute concentration are stored for every element in the pipe and surface domain 2 3 model verification to verify the model used here for transport of contaminants the lagrangean particle model for solute transport is verified against a high resolution eulerian transport model as the critical point for the flow level is the time dependent flow field a transport scenario in a non steady state flow scenario is considered the eulerian scheme is defined by a finite volume approach as defined in text books for example in leveque 2002 the time dependent flow velocity is calculated in both cases by solving the st venant equation using its characteristic form the test case consists of a channel of 20 kilometres length the eulerian model for flow as well as for transport is resolved with grid resolution of 1 meter and a time step size of 0 002 s in the test scenario water level and velocity are in instationary condition as the initial condition for transport a concentration bell curve is released in the channel with the centre of mass at location x 1 100 m and it has width of σ 223 6 m in the channel flow in normal discharge condition is supercritical with a mean velocity of 5 m s and water depth of 2 m while the concentration is transported downstream it is overtaken by a flood wave of 3 6 m initial total depth with a wave velocity of 6 8 m s velocity and water level from this model are used for the lagrangean particle model as advection flow field and for calculating the concentration the turbulent diffusion coefficient in both models is set to d 100 m 2 s for the quantification of error the first spatial moment of concentration over time is evaluated parker and genuchten 1984 the first moment in discretized form is 3 m t i 0 n ele c i t x i i 0 n ele c i t where c i t is the solute concentration m l 3 in element i at time t and x i is the position l of the centre of element i along the one dimensional channel axis the first moment m t is compared at all timesteps between the eulerian and the lagrangean approach fig 1 shows the relative error when the lagrangean particle model is used with 10 000 particles and a time step size of 1 s the relative error stays below 3 per thousand particles fig 2 shows the mass over time breakthrough curve for both models in a selected element after the flood wave has overtaken the concentration peak due to time discretization factors the mass of the particle model looks ragged the peak time of 33 min is almost the same it should be noted that the discretization needed to generate good results with the eulerian approach is 1000 times higher for the time discretization and 10 100 times higher for spatial discretization than applicable in commonly used models for simulating urban flood events 2 4 shortcut simplification in order to simplify the transport model a reduction of complexity in surface transport is suggested analysing the transport paths to inlet manholes for each outlet manhole results in similar transport paths from one manhole to another if a path between a common outlet and inlet is found the complex flow patterns on the surface can be reduced to a one dimensional path shortcut with a mean length and mean velocity this way the coupled 2d transport model is reduced to several much faster 1d transport models to test this approach every particle is tracked on the surface to create statistics about mean travel time and distance between spill out and re entry location fig 3 shows one example of shortcuts for one spill out manhole each arrows marks one surface transport paths from the manhole to one of the connected inlets or manholes where particles re entered the pipe network surface connections result in even more complex transport paths fig 3 shows that contaminants do not only follow the pipe system to the right side but also enter the pipe going to the lower side of the figure the lower pipe originally was not connected to the pipe system with the spilling manhole it was found that replacing the two dimensional simulation by the shortcut approach is not feasible due to a lack of accuracy in transport paths between manholes sample investigations show high variance in travel time along the surface deviation of up to 90 from the mean travel time exists for many shortcuts depending on slope and water level due to different times of out spill and current velocity a summation of transport characteristics is not possible temporary stay of particles in ponds and trapping of particles in ponds without further connection to the pipe system is not reproducible with shortcut simplification for this reason we found that the full 2d surface flow model is needed to represent the important transport paths 3 test case the influence of simplifications of the flow model and of the accuracy of the spill time on the transport prediction are studied with a test case which is described in this section 3 1 study area the investigated synthetic area has the size 2 3 km 2 urban characteristics make this location valuable for investigation of contamination spreading marshalling yard of the railway metal melting and manufacturing and storage in the north and eastern areas are industrial sites which represent possible sources of local contamination fig 4 a separate drainage pipe system is used to transport precipitation water to a river in the south a hill in the north provides a continuous slope of 1 on the surface towards the south the pipe network and topography are synthetic but generated with similarity to real cases in residential areas of middle sized cities the pipe network has no special features and is typical for urban residential areas the synthetic rain used for all scenarios is a synthetic rain of type euler type 2 with a duration of one hour and a statistical return period of fifty years it starts with a slow increasing rain volume when the rain moistens the surface and pipes the following peak intensity after 15 min can increase the velocity in the pipe system and on the surface and lead to surcharging manholes for test cases a point source is located at a northern position see fig 4 breakthrough curves are collected from a pipe in the south western outlet link from pipe system to the receiving river detailed focus on contamination patterns are made in a living area in the lower half of the map the resolution of the surface elevation model is 0 1 m for the street area that were accessible from car based scanners the remaining area is covered with satellite data of 0 5 m spatial resolution it should be noted that the rainfall event is chosen such that flooded surface area is likely all results that are discussed in the remainder of the paper are relevant for such flood scenarios only contaminant transport in the pipe system without flooded surfaces is of course possible but such scenarios are more straight forward and not the focus of this work 3 2 area discretization for the hydrodynamic simulation the study area is discretised two dimensionally with an irregular triangular mesh the mean triangle size is about 3 m 2 with local refinements at discontinuities such as curbstones this results in a total number of 1 2 million triangles with element size ranging from 0 08 m 2 to 30 m 2 buildings and other no flow areas are cut out of the grid all outer boundaries are treated as no flow edges rainfall is uniformly distributed to all surface triangles rainfall onto rooftops is directly routed into the pipe network the underground drainage pipe system is connected via manholes and street inlets to the surface to enable realistic flooding behaviour the pipes are represented as one dimensional elements the drainage system consists of 1224 pipe elements with a total length of 53 km a number of 1143 manholes along streets and 1854 street inlets are linking both systems for bidirectional exchange of drainage water 4 influence of flow model simplification on transport predictions the role of the drainage runoff model for contaminant transport in a surface and subsurface pipe system is shown by comparing models with different complexity a simulation can be speeded up by replacing the hydrodynamic calculation of surface flow with a hydrologic approach or by neglecting the influence of surface subsurface interaction at strong rainfall events for a hydrologic approach rainfall water is directly directed to the pipe system and no spillout back to the surface is possible therefore no hydrodynamic model for flow on the 2d surface needs to be solved however neglecting spillout of solute to the surface may result in unrealistic transport patterns in particular the storage function of a flooded surface for a contaminant is not captured which leads to too fast transport prediction to demonstrate the influence of surface water flow for transport paths of solutes first the runoff is calculated without a surface grid using only a hydrologic approach verworn and kenter 1993 second the flood simulation is run with coupling of the pipe network to shallow water surface flow but without contaminant transport on the surface as a third model a fully coupled surface subsurface model with hydraulic hydrodynamic calculation in both domains is used the transport processes in the flow fields with different model complexity are compared via breakthrough curves at an outlet pipe 4 1 breakthrough curve the different behaviour of volume flow with the three approaches when using hydrological vs hydrodynamic calculation is shown in fig 5 curves show the velocity flow and particle count in the outlet pipe the velocity wave front of both hydrologic and hydrodynamic runoff differ in their duration and magnitude of maximum velocity hydrologic runoff s velocity is 30 larger and duration of high velocity is 50 longer than in hydrodynamic runoff calculation in the drying period positions change the hydrologic calculation is draining faster than the surface bound hydrodynamic runoff calculation although the precipitation volume is the same the flow routing in the pipe network avoids mass conservation relation between the two runoff approaches that is why the routed flow of rainfall in the hydrologic approach does not fit to the hydrodynamic flow balance and is clearly recognisable for this selected pipe particle breakthrough curves for the three cases show the first flush at the same time of about 35 min after scenario start the hydrologic curve shows one main peak with the first flush front contaminant transport is performed over a timespan of about 40 min 0 30 until 1 10 the hydrodynamic simulation without surface transport for contaminants shows a similar breakthrough curve which is a bit more compact peak intensity is 25 larger and duration is 25 shorter than with the hydrologic approach the possibility of particle spillout to the surface creates a much more complex pattern the concentration of the first flush in the fully coupled hydrodynamic model is only one fourth of the magnitude of the other two cases and it breaks down after 10 min a second peak arises after 90 min with duration of 60 min the low concentration in the fully coupled model between the two peaks is a result of spilled out particles to the surface which accumulate in ponds as the water level is still high and street inlets are still flooded a large number of accumulated particles reach the relevant pipe to the outlet between 90 min and 150 min at this time the rainfall has stopped and the pipe system is draining the surface ponds particles can enter the pipe system again which has still high volume flow and therefore high transport velocities the fully coupled pipe 1d 2d surface model is assumed to be the most realistic one because it includes most details about the processes it can be seen clearly that both less complex models overestimate the mean transport velocity along the travel path because they do not take time delay due to ponding of solutes on the surface into account although it might not be crucial for water flow to forecast and simulate contaminant transport in the pipe domain during flash floods it is important to use a coupled model with exchange fluxes between surface and pipe system 5 patterns of surface pollution maps to identify surface areas which have a high potential to be affected by pollution after a contaminant spill at a given location a pollution risk map can be drawn for the surface it quantifies the risk of pollution with different colors the potential is increased when locations are passed more often or with lower velocity because the chance for accumulation of pollutants is higher transport is modelled using the lagrangean particle transport model at the end of each time step each particle is projected onto an underlying count raster to quantify concentration the concentration is accumulated over time the effect of long residence time due to low velocity and that of a high number of particles due to high concentration superpose in this method of counting because local spills can be embanked the trace of a pollution particle is only active when the transport path of advective movement is larger than 100 m this distance is selected to exclude stagnant spills only highly mobilised particles are used to generate the risk map in this work the risk map is designed using synthetic euler type 2 rainfall scenario a spill out after the peak rainfall has a potential to move contaminant back to the surface during the low rainfall and drying period after the peak unconnected ponds can form causing an accumulation of solute on the surface the influence of aspects in 1d 2d coupling are shown with 4 different setups a solute point sources at position of all manholes b uniformly distributed solute on the surface particles are only tracked when they travelled more than 100 m diffusion on the surface is disabled street inlets and manholes are sinks no spill out from the pipe system back to the surface c solute uniformly distributed on the surface tracking after 100 m movement surface diffusion disabled bidirectional coupling between pipe network and surface is enabled d solute uniformly distributed on the surface tracking after 100 m movement bidirectional coupling enabled surface diffusion set to a constant value of 0 01 m 2 s for setup a to c the surface diffusion is turned off setup a shows contamination of the surface through spill out of pollutants from the pipe system only while setup b only shows contamination via surface transportation fig 6 shows the risk map for a small part of the modelling domain for each of the four setups comparing the first two risk maps shows the difference in detected travel paths while spilled out particles a mainly follow the main roads uniformly distributed particles stay in backyards and only a few are released on the streets due to the fact that the uniformly distribution of contaminants onto the surface was very coarse setup b is not capable of generating maps with respect to spilled out pollution only setups c and d as a combination of surface distributed pollution and spill out pollution show the accumulation of contaminants along the streets and in backyards with enabled diffusion in scenario d the contamination area is expanded due to the effect of ponding on the surface where the velocity is low but water heights allow for particles to spread between neighbouring cells comparing the risk maps of scenario b and c the important role of coupling between pipe flow and surface flow for contaminant transport becomes clear in scenario c there are potentially contaminated parts that are not captured in scenario b when comparing scenarios c and d it becomes clear that mixing may be an important process as it connects stagnant pools that retain water on the surface which can enhance potentially contaminated areas this analysis shows that coupling of surface and pipe system transport is necessary to trace possible contamination paths enabling diffusion is necessary to identify ponds in which contaminants can easily be spread due to high water levels and internal mixing it should however be noted that diffusion coefficients for surface flow on streets and places is not well studied so the coefficients are very uncertain 6 influence of flow dynamics on contamination prediction pluvial flood events can lead to very dynamic behaviour of the flow in pipes and on the surface large changes to magnitude and direction can happen on time scales of minutes the result of the prediction of a single contamination event can thus depend strongly on the accuracy of the information about time and location of the accident in the following section this aspect is first illustrated with a test scenario the results are discussed in more detail in the second part 6 1 illustrative test case the drainage water routing and solute transport are calculated in the test area again for a pluvial flood event with a design rainfall euler type 2 with a duration of one hour and a statistical return period of 50 years a solute substance is spilled at the surface water at three different times contamination on the surface is used for quantification of the reaction to the spill time the time of spill is varied in the following way fig 7 1 starts together with the begin of rain 0 min 2 starts 10 min after the begin of rain 10 min 3 starts at the end of the precipitation peak 20 min each injection lasts for 5 min all injections are located at the same position on a road junction shown in the north of fig 4 the direction of transport in the pipe system and on the surface is from top to bottom in fig 8 fig 8 shows the contaminated areas with separate style for each of the three scenarios note that only the surface is shown contamination of the pipe network is not visible the contaminated areas strongly differ from each other in the centre is an area where contaminated surfaces of all three scenarios overlap manholes in this area were continuously flooded during the rain event areas affected by the first 0 min grey layer injection are further on the right side because solute already reached these areas when the rain became stronger and spill out from the pipe system happened green areas 10 min waves layer are on the left and right beside the centre it overlaps with some of the red areas on the right side the largest area of contamination is caused by the third injection 20 min dots layer spill outs occur right at the injection point on the left and spread widely on streets and through backyards to parallel streets where the solute is washed back to a minor filled pipe blue areas only occur between the injection point and the centre blue areas are broader than green and red along the streets later in time the water level on the surface is higher and ponds are larger solute can spread wider than at earlier injection times a key point for spreading of the latter scenario 20 min dots layer is a spillout manhole near to the point source due to the spillout the contaminant reaches an otherwise uncontaminated part of pipe network via the surface the short duration of spill out because of surcharge of the manhole makes the combination of surcharge time and contaminant passing time a rare event but the effect contaminates a huge area that would not be affected otherwise this spill only lasts for 6 min a high resolution in time is important to capture such significant events that may change pollution pathways and would cause contamination damage the total value of affected area and the intersection of contaminated areas are listed in table 1 the contaminated area for each injection time varies between 5 0 and 6 2 ha while the total area does not change much the location and shape of contaminated areas differ significantly from each other the common area intersection of first and second injection only share 3 32 ha 66 of first 53 of second area for the second intersection between second and third injection only 3 18 ha are contaminated in both scenarios areas that are contaminated in all three scenarios intersection share an area of 1 8 ha which is only 18 of the total contaminated area union of the three scenarios in general all three events do not have a similar contamination area only little common area can be forecasted if the injection time is not known with high accuracy since strong rain events only have a very short intense rainfall peak the time of injection relative to the rainfall pattern decides which contamination pattern might occur 6 2 discussion the numbers shown for the test example are specific for the test case and will differ in different settings the test case illustrates however why in cases where change of flow paths during a pluvial flood event due to flooding of surfaces can be expected the information about contamination time in relation to the time of rainfall peaks is rather important for predictions although generalization for all possible catchments and rainfalls is not possible some general influence of the settings can be discussed naturally the information about contaminant time is less crucial although not irrelevant if changes of flow paths during the flood event are not expected this applies to areas where no flooded surfaces are expected such as areas on hilltops or areas where the drainage system is dimensioned accordingly in steeper domains the variability of flow paths is weaker than in flatter domains as the diversion of flow paths perpendicular to the downhill direction is less strong for this reason the variability of contaminated areas for different injection times is less strong for steeper than for flatter domains the distance between injection location and outlet is also related to the injection time to illustrate this point we varied the test case in section 6 1 by changing the location of the contaminant injection to point 1 in map fig 9 and varying this location along the street with a distance of 300 m all other settings were kept and the injection time was for all three cases chosen as 10 min after the beginning of the rain the mean velocity in the pipes at injection time was about 1 m s the distance of 300 m in space relates therefore to a time distance of 5 min the contamination patterns for injection at different locations with 300 m distance and the same injection time were very similar to the contamination patterns for injection at the same location and at injection time differences of 5 min for this reason also the accuracy of information about the injection location can have an influence on the prediction of contaminated areas similar to the accuracy of information about the injection time the most important information about the time of injection is the time in relation to spillout times which is also related to the rainfall pattern to illustrate this point the simulations in the settings discussed in section 6 1 were repeated for a different rainfall pattern where the rainfall intensity was constant in time the rainfall volume was equal to the rainfall volume of the euler rainfall used in the test case this case can be considered as a contrast scenario in terms of rainfall pattern the contaminated area for the different injection times are generally smaller and have an increasing contamination area table 2 this is due to the much later appearance of spillouts at manholes compared to the euler rainfall scenario 7 concluding remarks and outlook the present study shows that transport paths of contaminants after a spill event in a pluvial flood depend on the time dependent flow field which can vary strongly according to the rainfall hydrodynamic models capture complex flow patterns better than simplified models a high temporal resolution of the velocity field is necessary to capture short duration path changes that split transport paths and may cause increased contaminated areas the accuracy depends on the temporal and spatial resolution of rainfall input which has to be investigated in future research it is demonstrated that the surface plays an important role as storage and sink for contaminants due to low velocity and ponding of drainage water these effects cannot be captured with simplifications of the surface model and demand digital terrain models with high spatial resolution small variations in injection time for spill events can cause large differences in contaminant spreading patterns for strong fluctuations of contaminants in drainage water all approaches for generating the flow field have to be accurate to provide a basis for the prediction of pollution transport useful simplification of solute transport models apart from fully coupled 1d 2d hydrodynamic modelling could not be identified further investigation with the particle transport model will be on the leakage of pollution into the soil system in case of broken pipes in the drainage system peche et al 2017 acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial support by the

6815,a lagrangean particle based transport model is introduced to calculate the potential contamination paths of solutes in drainage water in an urban area during a pluvial flood event the necessity

transport paths and breakthrough curves of contaminant concentration in drainage water an analysis for time variation of a single location spill event is performed that shows a high variability in solute spreading depending on the spill relative to the rainfall characteristics keywords hydrodynamic model lagrangean particles pollution risk map random walk surface water pollution 1 introduction pluvial floods due to strong rainfall events are an important topic in many cities as they can cause damage to infrastructure and endanger health of civilians jha et al 2012 damage is not only a consequence of water level outside and inside buildings but also of hazardous contaminants in the water rözer et al 2016 because the surface is widely sealed in urban areas the rainfall can only be drained via the surface and the subsurface pipe system due to exceeding pipe capacity water can be spilled to the surface through surcharged manholes thus the flow patterns and transport paths in drainage water can be very complex when compared to dry weather conditions many software tools are available for simulating the flood area of urban catchments after a heavy rainfall with physically based numerical models they use a combination of pipe network 1d and surface runoff 2d coupling to compute expected water levels ellis and viavattene 2014 based on the complexity of their physically based numerical model they solve pressurised flow and shallow water equations ettrich et al 2005 to calculate water depths and flow velocity in the pipe network and on the surface time dependent rainfall rates serve as input values examples for such 1d 2d coupled models are hystem extran 2d itwh 2010 mike flood danish hydraulic institute dhi group 2017 and infoworks icm innovyze 2018 apart from the flooding understanding transport of hazardous solute and forecasting pollution spreading is an important topic to protect urban areas from contamination pollution of storm water is a widely investigated topic when cities use a combined sewer system sewerage and rainfall is drained in the same pipes in this case the amount of sewerage is of interest to predict concentration of combined sewer overflow to rivers manholes can bring sewerage to the surface water when pipe capacity is exceeded thereby endangering human health mclellan et al 2007 depositing sediments of nutrients and heavy metals accumulate on the surface during dry weather periods they are washed off during rainfall as part of the storm water this type of accumulation is a widely spread source of water contamination vaze and chiew 2004 zhang et al 2017 traffic accidents and leaking barrels in industrial areas and private households may also lead to water contamination while such accidents are certainly rare the potential damage can be very high fast detection and forecasting can help to embank contaminant spreading and to plan fast decontamination of affected areas accidents with hazardous liquids are point sources and have to be treated differently from diffusive sources additionally the calculation must be accurate and fast for a forecast system this work focuses on modelling pollution transport after a point source spill event it should be noted that the model introduced in this paper could also be applied for the other cases too the 1d 2d coupled software tools provide time dependent flow velocities and exchange fluxes between pipe and surface water accurate models for solute transport in the pipe system and the surface domain are not provided by these tools at the current time if transport is included the models are based on an eulerian approach with element and grid based transport description for the pipe system there are several commercial and open source models that provide a calculation of sewerage concentration zoppou 2001 due to large element length the quality of concentration prediction is only good for sewerage transport where sources are diffusive for tracking single spills these models are not very accurate due to large elements furthermore not many models include a transport model for pollution in surface water a 2d pollution transport model was introduced by pathirana et al 2011 as an extension to the swmm model rossman 2010 combining it with the 2d surface flow model of begnudelli and sanders 2006 transport is based on a finite volume scheme which is locally and globally mass conservative in both domains each element is treated as well mixed over a length of several meters elliott and trowsdale 2007 with such large grid cells modelling the transport of single spill events is problematic due to the grid based eulerian method due to the numerical diffusion a decrease of the peak intensity and a widening of concentration breakthrough curves occur this can deteriorate predictions severely as dynamic transport paths require a good spatial resolution of the contaminant plume effects of numerical diffusion can be diminished via local mesh refinement and higher order schemes with slope limiter improvements benkhaldoun et al 2007 structure refinement and higher order schemes imply a high computational effort which make them computational costly and slow an alternative to an eulerian is the lagrangean approach which is not bound to a grid because all transport movement is described by individual particle kinematics ahlstrom et al 1977 used a random walk approach with particles representing an amount of mass to reproduce pollution transport in a mass conservative way when using a large number of particles with a lagrangean random walk approach the analytical solution of advective diffusive transport can be achieved hathhorn 1997 as an example lagrangean based particle transport models have been widely used in transport models in the subsurface on a pore scale blunt et al 2013 by applying advection dispersion movement of dissolved matter in one dimensional pore space networks fatt 1956 in this study we present a solute transport model that builds up on flow fields in a pipe network and on the surface calculated with eulerian based methods and uses a lagrangean random walk approach for mixing and dispersion pollution is tracked in the velocity field of pipe and surface flow to identify transport paths and to generate a risk map of particle accumulation after a point source spill event the model is used to study the impact of simplifications on the transport model time and location of contaminant sources are important information for a good prediction regarding water quality adequate resolution is required which might not be achieved by official measurements pan and ling 2017 volunteered geographical information vgi can be used to generate reports of spill events by civil users concepts of information gathering are divided into two groups characterized as a specific software e g smartphone application is provided to collect such data or filters are utilised to collect information from social media content and streams to extract water quality information some examples show the wide range of possibilities for flood level gathering from social media fohringer et al 2015 stream flow measurements with smartphones mazzoleni et al 2015 and image sampling of surface water breuer et al 2015 the quality of information and the localization is one of the most challenging problems when using vgi data poser and dransch 2010 for this reason an investigation of the impact on the accuracy of input information on the plume prediction is needed 2 transport model in this section the transport model used in the study is introduced it builds upon flow fields calculated with a hydrodynamic model 2 1 volume flow calculation the hydrodynamic 1d 2d numerical model hystem extran 2d itwh 2010 is used to generate surface and pipe flow velocity fields during a flash flood event for data input a rainfall time series is used precipitation is distributed equally over the entire area with intensity variation only in time the reason is that the test area is small enough for this approximation to be reasonable however the results of this study are not limited by this as the rainfall patterns are not crucial for the conclusions the flow field on the surface is calculated using a finite volume scheme solving the diffusive wave approximation of the shallow water equation source and sink terms link the surface flow to the pipe system in the pipe system a finite volume scheme is used to solve the st venant equations with friction slope calculation via manning strickler both schemes are solved using an explicit newton scheme for time integration and take the courant friedrich lévy criterion into account the advantage of finite volume discretization is global and local mass conservation this is an important requirement for not underestimating water levels during the forecast simulation dawson et al 2004 2 2 solute transport the transport of contaminants is modelled with a lagrangean approach assigning the mass of contaminant to a number of particles any chemical reaction sorption or other partitioning of the substance is neglected here the purpose of this study is the analysis of transport paths rather than the concentration values so that this simplification is justified an assumption for this model is that the additional volume of an added substance is neglected thus a spilled solute that contaminates the water during a strong rainfall event does not change the flow field itself the advection diffusion equation 1 c t v t c d 2 c describing the change of concentration c m l 3 over time t t with the advection velocity v l t 1 and the diffusion coefficient d l 2 t 1 is solved with a random walk approach kinzelbach 1988 in the pipe network domain each particle s position x is moved along the pipe axis based on the underlying advective velocity v on the surface the particles are moved according to velocity vectors that are interpolated from the computational grid points to the location of the particles the movement of the particles with flow velocity over one time step δ t capture the advective transport if the pipe system has a junction point where drainage water is directed in different outgoing directions e g spill to surface the particles are directed proportional to the fluxes this method is also applied for the re entry points on the surface particles can not enter the pipe system if street inlets and manholes are blocked mixing is included as a random walk turbulent mixing is assumed to be the most important process in the random walk step time discretised movement of each particle is randomly distributed by a gaussian normal distributed variable λ ahlstrom et al 1977 the total movement of a particle according to eq 1 with this explicit eulerian approach is 2 x t δ t x t v x t δ t 2 d δ t λ turbulent diffusion is scaled by the diffusion coefficient d which has a magnitude of 2 m 2 s inside the pipe system based on an assumption in schlütter et al 2003 for sewer systems turbulent diffusion in urban surface water was not found to be discussed in the literature so far based on lin and falconer 1997 who described mixing in near shore tidal flow models the coefficient has a magnitude of 0 01 m 2 s which is one order of magnitude higher than in the approach of fischer et al 1968 for turbulent diffusion in river streams the value of 0 01 m 2 s is used here because additional circumstances might increase mixing in surface water during a strong rainfall event for example wind induced circulation rain drop impact or passing car tires might lead to additional mixing in ponds of surface water with an unknown magnitude of the diffusion coefficient a cloud of particles is placed into the water at each point source spill location each particle gets an equal part of the total injection mass since particles do not represent a volume concentration of solutes cannot be calculated directly from particles it has to be computed from the relation of particles mass and the surrounding water volume the number of particles leads to a limitation of concentration resolution at the end of each time step each particle s position is used to select the containing cell element from the surface grid or the pipe element in the subsurface domain the particles masses are summarised in this cell water volume is calculated from water level and cell area solute concentration is computed for each cell by dividing total mass by water volume for each time step the mass and solute concentration are stored for every element in the pipe and surface domain 2 3 model verification to verify the model used here for transport of contaminants the lagrangean particle model for solute transport is verified against a high resolution eulerian transport model as the critical point for the flow level is the time dependent flow field a transport scenario in a non steady state flow scenario is considered the eulerian scheme is defined by a finite volume approach as defined in text books for example in leveque 2002 the time dependent flow velocity is calculated in both cases by solving the st venant equation using its characteristic form the test case consists of a channel of 20 kilometres length the eulerian model for flow as well as for transport is resolved with grid resolution of 1 meter and a time step size of 0 002 s in the test scenario water level and velocity are in instationary condition as the initial condition for transport a concentration bell curve is released in the channel with the centre of mass at location x 1 100 m and it has width of σ 223 6 m in the channel flow in normal discharge condition is supercritical with a mean velocity of 5 m s and water depth of 2 m while the concentration is transported downstream it is overtaken by a flood wave of 3 6 m initial total depth with a wave velocity of 6 8 m s velocity and water level from this model are used for the lagrangean particle model as advection flow field and for calculating the concentration the turbulent diffusion coefficient in both models is set to d 100 m 2 s for the quantification of error the first spatial moment of concentration over time is evaluated parker and genuchten 1984 the first moment in discretized form is 3 m t i 0 n ele c i t x i i 0 n ele c i t where c i t is the solute concentration m l 3 in element i at time t and x i is the position l of the centre of element i along the one dimensional channel axis the first moment m t is compared at all timesteps between the eulerian and the lagrangean approach fig 1 shows the relative error when the lagrangean particle model is used with 10 000 particles and a time step size of 1 s the relative error stays below 3 per thousand particles fig 2 shows the mass over time breakthrough curve for both models in a selected element after the flood wave has overtaken the concentration peak due to time discretization factors the mass of the particle model looks ragged the peak time of 33 min is almost the same it should be noted that the discretization needed to generate good results with the eulerian approach is 1000 times higher for the time discretization and 10 100 times higher for spatial discretization than applicable in commonly used models for simulating urban flood events 2 4 shortcut simplification in order to simplify the transport model a reduction of complexity in surface transport is suggested analysing the transport paths to inlet manholes for each outlet manhole results in similar transport paths from one manhole to another if a path between a common outlet and inlet is found the complex flow patterns on the surface can be reduced to a one dimensional path shortcut with a mean length and mean velocity this way the coupled 2d transport model is reduced to several much faster 1d transport models to test this approach every particle is tracked on the surface to create statistics about mean travel time and distance between spill out and re entry location fig 3 shows one example of shortcuts for one spill out manhole each arrows marks one surface transport paths from the manhole to one of the connected inlets or manholes where particles re entered the pipe network surface connections result in even more complex transport paths fig 3 shows that contaminants do not only follow the pipe system to the right side but also enter the pipe going to the lower side of the figure the lower pipe originally was not connected to the pipe system with the spilling manhole it was found that replacing the two dimensional simulation by the shortcut approach is not feasible due to a lack of accuracy in transport paths between manholes sample investigations show high variance in travel time along the surface deviation of up to 90 from the mean travel time exists for many shortcuts depending on slope and water level due to different times of out spill and current velocity a summation of transport characteristics is not possible temporary stay of particles in ponds and trapping of particles in ponds without further connection to the pipe system is not reproducible with shortcut simplification for this reason we found that the full 2d surface flow model is needed to represent the important transport paths 3 test case the influence of simplifications of the flow model and of the accuracy of the spill time on the transport prediction are studied with a test case which is described in this section 3 1 study area the investigated synthetic area has the size 2 3 km 2 urban characteristics make this location valuable for investigation of contamination spreading marshalling yard of the railway metal melting and manufacturing and storage in the north and eastern areas are industrial sites which represent possible sources of local contamination fig 4 a separate drainage pipe system is used to transport precipitation water to a river in the south a hill in the north provides a continuous slope of 1 on the surface towards the south the pipe network and topography are synthetic but generated with similarity to real cases in residential areas of middle sized cities the pipe network has no special features and is typical for urban residential areas the synthetic rain used for all scenarios is a synthetic rain of type euler type 2 with a duration of one hour and a statistical return period of fifty years it starts with a slow increasing rain volume when the rain moistens the surface and pipes the following peak intensity after 15 min can increase the velocity in the pipe system and on the surface and lead to surcharging manholes for test cases a point source is located at a northern position see fig 4 breakthrough curves are collected from a pipe in the south western outlet link from pipe system to the receiving river detailed focus on contamination patterns are made in a living area in the lower half of the map the resolution of the surface elevation model is 0 1 m for the street area that were accessible from car based scanners the remaining area is covered with satellite data of 0 5 m spatial resolution it should be noted that the rainfall event is chosen such that flooded surface area is likely all results that are discussed in the remainder of the paper are relevant for such flood scenarios only contaminant transport in the pipe system without flooded surfaces is of course possible but such scenarios are more straight forward and not the focus of this work 3 2 area discretization for the hydrodynamic simulation the study area is discretised two dimensionally with an irregular triangular mesh the mean triangle size is about 3 m 2 with local refinements at discontinuities such as curbstones this results in a total number of 1 2 million triangles with element size ranging from 0 08 m 2 to 30 m 2 buildings and other no flow areas are cut out of the grid all outer boundaries are treated as no flow edges rainfall is uniformly distributed to all surface triangles rainfall onto rooftops is directly routed into the pipe network the underground drainage pipe system is connected via manholes and street inlets to the surface to enable realistic flooding behaviour the pipes are represented as one dimensional elements the drainage system consists of 1224 pipe elements with a total length of 53 km a number of 1143 manholes along streets and 1854 street inlets are linking both systems for bidirectional exchange of drainage water 4 influence of flow model simplification on transport predictions the role of the drainage runoff model for contaminant transport in a surface and subsurface pipe system is shown by comparing models with different complexity a simulation can be speeded up by replacing the hydrodynamic calculation of surface flow with a hydrologic approach or by neglecting the influence of surface subsurface interaction at strong rainfall events for a hydrologic approach rainfall water is directly directed to the pipe system and no spillout back to the surface is possible therefore no hydrodynamic model for flow on the 2d surface needs to be solved however neglecting spillout of solute to the surface may result in unrealistic transport patterns in particular the storage function of a flooded surface for a contaminant is not captured which leads to too fast transport prediction to demonstrate the influence of surface water flow for transport paths of solutes first the runoff is calculated without a surface grid using only a hydrologic approach verworn and kenter 1993 second the flood simulation is run with coupling of the pipe network to shallow water surface flow but without contaminant transport on the surface as a third model a fully coupled surface subsurface model with hydraulic hydrodynamic calculation in both domains is used the transport processes in the flow fields with different model complexity are compared via breakthrough curves at an outlet pipe 4 1 breakthrough curve the different behaviour of volume flow with the three approaches when using hydrological vs hydrodynamic calculation is shown in fig 5 curves show the velocity flow and particle count in the outlet pipe the velocity wave front of both hydrologic and hydrodynamic runoff differ in their duration and magnitude of maximum velocity hydrologic runoff s velocity is 30 larger and duration of high velocity is 50 longer than in hydrodynamic runoff calculation in the drying period positions change the hydrologic calculation is draining faster than the surface bound hydrodynamic runoff calculation although the precipitation volume is the same the flow routing in the pipe network avoids mass conservation relation between the two runoff approaches that is why the routed flow of rainfall in the hydrologic approach does not fit to the hydrodynamic flow balance and is clearly recognisable for this selected pipe particle breakthrough curves for the three cases show the first flush at the same time of about 35 min after scenario start the hydrologic curve shows one main peak with the first flush front contaminant transport is performed over a timespan of about 40 min 0 30 until 1 10 the hydrodynamic simulation without surface transport for contaminants shows a similar breakthrough curve which is a bit more compact peak intensity is 25 larger and duration is 25 shorter than with the hydrologic approach the possibility of particle spillout to the surface creates a much more complex pattern the concentration of the first flush in the fully coupled hydrodynamic model is only one fourth of the magnitude of the other two cases and it breaks down after 10 min a second peak arises after 90 min with duration of 60 min the low concentration in the fully coupled model between the two peaks is a result of spilled out particles to the surface which accumulate in ponds as the water level is still high and street inlets are still flooded a large number of accumulated particles reach the relevant pipe to the outlet between 90 min and 150 min at this time the rainfall has stopped and the pipe system is draining the surface ponds particles can enter the pipe system again which has still high volume flow and therefore high transport velocities the fully coupled pipe 1d 2d surface model is assumed to be the most realistic one because it includes most details about the processes it can be seen clearly that both less complex models overestimate the mean transport velocity along the travel path because they do not take time delay due to ponding of solutes on the surface into account although it might not be crucial for water flow to forecast and simulate contaminant transport in the pipe domain during flash floods it is important to use a coupled model with exchange fluxes between surface and pipe system 5 patterns of surface pollution maps to identify surface areas which have a high potential to be affected by pollution after a contaminant spill at a given location a pollution risk map can be drawn for the surface it quantifies the risk of pollution with different colors the potential is increased when locations are passed more often or with lower velocity because the chance for accumulation of pollutants is higher transport is modelled using the lagrangean particle transport model at the end of each time step each particle is projected onto an underlying count raster to quantify concentration the concentration is accumulated over time the effect of long residence time due to low velocity and that of a high number of particles due to high concentration superpose in this method of counting because local spills can be embanked the trace of a pollution particle is only active when the transport path of advective movement is larger than 100 m this distance is selected to exclude stagnant spills only highly mobilised particles are used to generate the risk map in this work the risk map is designed using synthetic euler type 2 rainfall scenario a spill out after the peak rainfall has a potential to move contaminant back to the surface during the low rainfall and drying period after the peak unconnected ponds can form causing an accumulation of solute on the surface the influence of aspects in 1d 2d coupling are shown with 4 different setups a solute point sources at position of all manholes b uniformly distributed solute on the surface particles are only tracked when they travelled more than 100 m diffusion on the surface is disabled street inlets and manholes are sinks no spill out from the pipe system back to the surface c solute uniformly distributed on the surface tracking after 100 m movement surface diffusion disabled bidirectional coupling between pipe network and surface is enabled d solute uniformly distributed on the surface tracking after 100 m movement bidirectional coupling enabled surface diffusion set to a constant value of 0 01 m 2 s for setup a to c the surface diffusion is turned off setup a shows contamination of the surface through spill out of pollutants from the pipe system only while setup b only shows contamination via surface transportation fig 6 shows the risk map for a small part of the modelling domain for each of the four setups comparing the first two risk maps shows the difference in detected travel paths while spilled out particles a mainly follow the main roads uniformly distributed particles stay in backyards and only a few are released on the streets due to the fact that the uniformly distribution of contaminants onto the surface was very coarse setup b is not capable of generating maps with respect to spilled out pollution only setups c and d as a combination of surface distributed pollution and spill out pollution show the accumulation of contaminants along the streets and in backyards with enabled diffusion in scenario d the contamination area is expanded due to the effect of ponding on the surface where the velocity is low but water heights allow for particles to spread between neighbouring cells comparing the risk maps of scenario b and c the important role of coupling between pipe flow and surface flow for contaminant transport becomes clear in scenario c there are potentially contaminated parts that are not captured in scenario b when comparing scenarios c and d it becomes clear that mixing may be an important process as it connects stagnant pools that retain water on the surface which can enhance potentially contaminated areas this analysis shows that coupling of surface and pipe system transport is necessary to trace possible contamination paths enabling diffusion is necessary to identify ponds in which contaminants can easily be spread due to high water levels and internal mixing it should however be noted that diffusion coefficients for surface flow on streets and places is not well studied so the coefficients are very uncertain 6 influence of flow dynamics on contamination prediction pluvial flood events can lead to very dynamic behaviour of the flow in pipes and on the surface large changes to magnitude and direction can happen on time scales of minutes the result of the prediction of a single contamination event can thus depend strongly on the accuracy of the information about time and location of the accident in the following section this aspect is first illustrated with a test scenario the results are discussed in more detail in the second part 6 1 illustrative test case the drainage water routing and solute transport are calculated in the test area again for a pluvial flood event with a design rainfall euler type 2 with a duration of one hour and a statistical return period of 50 years a solute substance is spilled at the surface water at three different times contamination on the surface is used for quantification of the reaction to the spill time the time of spill is varied in the following way fig 7 1 starts together with the begin of rain 0 min 2 starts 10 min after the begin of rain 10 min 3 starts at the end of the precipitation peak 20 min each injection lasts for 5 min all injections are located at the same position on a road junction shown in the north of fig 4 the direction of transport in the pipe system and on the surface is from top to bottom in fig 8 fig 8 shows the contaminated areas with separate style for each of the three scenarios note that only the surface is shown contamination of the pipe network is not visible the contaminated areas strongly differ from each other in the centre is an area where contaminated surfaces of all three scenarios overlap manholes in this area were continuously flooded during the rain event areas affected by the first 0 min grey layer injection are further on the right side because solute already reached these areas when the rain became stronger and spill out from the pipe system happened green areas 10 min waves layer are on the left and right beside the centre it overlaps with some of the red areas on the right side the largest area of contamination is caused by the third injection 20 min dots layer spill outs occur right at the injection point on the left and spread widely on streets and through backyards to parallel streets where the solute is washed back to a minor filled pipe blue areas only occur between the injection point and the centre blue areas are broader than green and red along the streets later in time the water level on the surface is higher and ponds are larger solute can spread wider than at earlier injection times a key point for spreading of the latter scenario 20 min dots layer is a spillout manhole near to the point source due to the spillout the contaminant reaches an otherwise uncontaminated part of pipe network via the surface the short duration of spill out because of surcharge of the manhole makes the combination of surcharge time and contaminant passing time a rare event but the effect contaminates a huge area that would not be affected otherwise this spill only lasts for 6 min a high resolution in time is important to capture such significant events that may change pollution pathways and would cause contamination damage the total value of affected area and the intersection of contaminated areas are listed in table 1 the contaminated area for each injection time varies between 5 0 and 6 2 ha while the total area does not change much the location and shape of contaminated areas differ significantly from each other the common area intersection of first and second injection only share 3 32 ha 66 of first 53 of second area for the second intersection between second and third injection only 3 18 ha are contaminated in both scenarios areas that are contaminated in all three scenarios intersection share an area of 1 8 ha which is only 18 of the total contaminated area union of the three scenarios in general all three events do not have a similar contamination area only little common area can be forecasted if the injection time is not known with high accuracy since strong rain events only have a very short intense rainfall peak the time of injection relative to the rainfall pattern decides which contamination pattern might occur 6 2 discussion the numbers shown for the test example are specific for the test case and will differ in different settings the test case illustrates however why in cases where change of flow paths during a pluvial flood event due to flooding of surfaces can be expected the information about contamination time in relation to the time of rainfall peaks is rather important for predictions although generalization for all possible catchments and rainfalls is not possible some general influence of the settings can be discussed naturally the information about contaminant time is less crucial although not irrelevant if changes of flow paths during the flood event are not expected this applies to areas where no flooded surfaces are expected such as areas on hilltops or areas where the drainage system is dimensioned accordingly in steeper domains the variability of flow paths is weaker than in flatter domains as the diversion of flow paths perpendicular to the downhill direction is less strong for this reason the variability of contaminated areas for different injection times is less strong for steeper than for flatter domains the distance between injection location and outlet is also related to the injection time to illustrate this point we varied the test case in section 6 1 by changing the location of the contaminant injection to point 1 in map fig 9 and varying this location along the street with a distance of 300 m all other settings were kept and the injection time was for all three cases chosen as 10 min after the beginning of the rain the mean velocity in the pipes at injection time was about 1 m s the distance of 300 m in space relates therefore to a time distance of 5 min the contamination patterns for injection at different locations with 300 m distance and the same injection time were very similar to the contamination patterns for injection at the same location and at injection time differences of 5 min for this reason also the accuracy of information about the injection location can have an influence on the prediction of contaminated areas similar to the accuracy of information about the injection time the most important information about the time of injection is the time in relation to spillout times which is also related to the rainfall pattern to illustrate this point the simulations in the settings discussed in section 6 1 were repeated for a different rainfall pattern where the rainfall intensity was constant in time the rainfall volume was equal to the rainfall volume of the euler rainfall used in the test case this case can be considered as a contrast scenario in terms of rainfall pattern the contaminated area for the different injection times are generally smaller and have an increasing contamination area table 2 this is due to the much later appearance of spillouts at manholes compared to the euler rainfall scenario 7 concluding remarks and outlook the present study shows that transport paths of contaminants after a spill event in a pluvial flood depend on the time dependent flow field which can vary strongly according to the rainfall hydrodynamic models capture complex flow patterns better than simplified models a high temporal resolution of the velocity field is necessary to capture short duration path changes that split transport paths and may cause increased contaminated areas the accuracy depends on the temporal and spatial resolution of rainfall input which has to be investigated in future research it is demonstrated that the surface plays an important role as storage and sink for contaminants due to low velocity and ponding of drainage water these effects cannot be captured with simplifications of the surface model and demand digital terrain models with high spatial resolution small variations in injection time for spill events can cause large differences in contaminant spreading patterns for strong fluctuations of contaminants in drainage water all approaches for generating the flow field have to be accurate to provide a basis for the prediction of pollution transport useful simplification of solute transport models apart from fully coupled 1d 2d hydrodynamic modelling could not be identified further investigation with the particle transport model will be on the leakage of pollution into the soil system in case of broken pipes in the drainage system peche et al 2017 acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial support by the

6816,the most uncertain parameter in determining the stage discharge relationship of an ungauged stream is the friction factor a parameter for which a gauged stream can be back calculated using hydrometric survey data that has been compiled over a wide range of flow conditions the existing friction factor models for ungauged streams that do not require hydrometric survey data as input can have very large prediction errors in this study 415 streamflow events collected from 52 rivers across three continents were assembled to allow for the use of a suitable global dataset size range to develop a robust model for the prediction of the friction factor in ungauged streams using two machine learning algorithms gene expression programing gep and extreme learning machine elm the new gep and elm models outperformed existing models with significantly improved r squared values of 0 76 and 0 78 respectively the combination of the two input parameters relative smoothness and the friction slope allowed the new models to more accurately predict the friction factor for a wider range of streams and flow conditions the forecasting uncertainty of the developed gep and elm models were compared with past models and found to be the least uncertain with width uncertainty band wub values of 0 0536 and 0 0504 respectively for the first time in this field of research partial derivative sensitivity analysis was applied to the trends of the friction factor estimation by gep and elm it was found that gep and elm models are extremely sensitive to friction slope in comparison with relative smoothness the gep and elm model results for predicting the darcy weisbach friction factor were compared with different existing relationships and the superior performance of the proposed

use with ungauged streams jarrett 1984 developed a model to predict the roughness coefficient for high gradient streams conditions under which it is challenging to measure mean velocity the model is a function of friction slope and hydraulic radius the complex channel and surface properties that influence surface roughness are often challenging to measure choo et al 2014 rosgen 1994 in an attempt to estimate channel roughness based on river classification visual guides and look up tables have been developed to correlate the roughness coefficient to visual indicators such as the presence of vegetation boulders or meandering conditions e g see barnes 1967 chow 1959 rosgen 1994 this qualitative technique has limitations as each river reach has complex and specific geometry that cannot be identified through an image azamathulla et al 2013 forzieri et al 2010 hicks and mason 1998 jiang and li 2010 powell 2014 rosgen 1994 the bed form that is manifested has a direct impact on the resistance to flow phillips and tadayon 2006 therefore a reliable estimate of the n value requires knowledge of flow hydraulics and the geometry of channels in addition to sufficient field data such as bed material sizes in recent decades data driven methods have been developed that offer an alternative approach to solve nonlinear problems compared to previous methods for modelling complex phenomena more recent models have incorporated additional input parameters azamathulla et al 2013 included the froude number reynolds number and equivalent wall roughness azamathulla 2013 incorporated sediment properties such as shape factor grain size and critical depth in addition to the froude number that requires flow velocity measurements and hydrometric surveys not available for ungauged sites the genetic programming model developed by roushangar et al 2014 predicts the roughness coefficient as a function of the slope of the free surface reynolds number and relative smoothness artificial intelligence ai techniques such as gene expression programming gep are useful for accurate prediction of hydraulic phenomena techniques such as gep have reasonable calculation times and have become popular with researchers e g guven and gunal 2008 ghani and azamathulla 2011 mohammadpour et al 2013 ebtehaj et al 2015a sheikh et al 2016 azimi et al 2017 bonakdari et al 2018 sattar et al 2018 as gep facilitates the precise prediction of hydraulic phenomena in addition gep has the capacity to create an explicit equation for predicting variables a powerful advantage of this method for practical applications another popular and effective ai based technique is the extreme learning machine elm elm is a non tuned fast technique ebtehaj and bonakdari 2016 the training speed in this approach is generally very fast comparably higher than the training speeds of gep and other popular ai based techniques such as artificial neural networks support vector machines and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems ebtehaj et al 2018 moreover in modeling a nonlinear complex model with elm the user need only tune one parameter and the number of hidden neurons while in other ai techniques there are many adjustable parameters with values on which the performance of the model is highly dependent 1 2 research objective the goal of this study is to determine if larger global datasets and machine learning tools can be used to improve existing empirical roughness coefficient models for ungauged streams the current research focuses on ungauged streams and therefore models that do not use flow velocity or other parameters that rely on flow velocity such as the froude number as model input machine learning tools namely gene expression programming gep and extreme learning machine elm are trained with a large global data set to develop new models based on a limited number of physical characteristic parameters these new models are then applied to ungauged streams the proposed equations based on gep and elm are compared to existing empirical models that do not require hydrometric data models that incorporate input parameters that are not available in the compiled data set were excluded from the comparison moreover the trends of friction factor estimation calculated by gep and elm are analysed by partial derivative sensitivity analysis for the first time in this field and the uncertainty of the developed models is also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrometric data in order to produce a robust model hydrometric data from four sources were compiled and assembled into consistent units the study by jarrett 1984 focused on 21 high gradient rivers s 0 002 in the colorado rocky mountains with a dataset of 69 observations these natural stream sites covered a large area from piedra river with a latitude of 37 13 20 to elk river with a latitude of 40 43 03 and arkansas river with a longitude of 106 12 46 to hermosa creek with a longitude of 107 50 40 the morphology of these high gradient natural streams was relatively straight and uniform with little vegetation present and stable channel bed and banks the data ranges measured in jarrett s 1984 tests for computing the darcy weisbach friction factor were as follows 0 15 r m 1 68 0 002 s f 0 034 0 16 h m 1 94 0 09 d 84 m 0 79 where r is the hydraulic radius s f is the friction slope h is the mean channel depth and d 84 is the diameter of the 84th percentile of particle distribution similarly bathurst 1985 focused on high gradient streams in the united kingdom specifically examining gravel beds with a dataset of 41 observations in 16 sites in the upland british rivers the climate of the area was cool and wet with mean annual rainfall ranging from 1000 to 3000 mm these reaches were situated either in riffle sections between pool structures or in mountain reaches with no defined riffle pool sequence and minimal vegetation the data ranges in bathurst s 1985 experiments were as follows 0 1 r m 1 18 0 004 s f 0 0373 0 1 h m 1 31 0 11 d 84 m 0 74 colosimo et al 1988 focused on channels with shallow flow and gravel beds with 42 observations in streams in calabria southern italy the climate of the area was mediterranean with considerable differences in temperature and rainfall between seasons these streams were relatively uniform with little vegetation present on the bed and the banks the data ranges measured in colosimo et al s 1988 experiments were as follows 0 23 r m 0 55 0 0026 s f 0 0190 0 26 h m 0 58 0 04 d 84 m 0 12 hicks and mason 1998 cover a wide range of rivers throughout new zealand with no specific target range for any parameters and documented 461 observations over 78 river reaches data was collected predominantly in temperate zones with a maritime climate a subset of 263 observations was used in developing the model these streams were relatively straight with vegetation present on the banks in most of the study reaches the data ranges in hicks and mason s 1998 test were as follows 0 18 r m 9 17 0 001 s f 0 0403 0 18 h m 10 63 0 d 84 m 1 26 2 2 parameter selection repeatedly throughout the technical literature there is an emphasis on grain size distribution slope and channel geometry butler et al 2015 ferguson 2007 julien 2002 roushangar et al 2014 channel geometry has an influence on the roughness coefficient as the extent of surface boundary conditions will affect the extent of shear stress on the channel velocity colosimo et al 1988 keulegan 1938 numerous studies have developed relationships between grain size distribution and channel roughness coefficients azamathulla and jarrett 2013 chow 1959 sturm and tuzson 2001 keulegan 1938 and strickler 1923 both developed models based on the mean grain size diameter but the study by limerinos 1970 emphasized that the 84th percentile produced simpler and slightly more accurate results than the mean diameter the 84th percentile is a grain size that has been subsequently adopted for roughness coefficient models azamathulla and jarrett 2013 azamathulla 2013 ferguson 2007 in addition some studies have applied the relative roughness or relative smoothness term expressed as a dimensionless number of h d84 or r d84 using this technique particle size distribution plays a role in predicting roughness when the depth is low or the particle diameter size is large bathurst 1985 cheng 2014 colosimo et al 1988 roushangar et al 2014 the chezy and manning formulae were based on the energy slope choo et al 2014 friction slope is relatively consistent with energy slopes on low slope channels and in high gradient streams where the emphasis is on bed material friction slope plays a larger role in estimating roughness as it is a predictor of which type of bed material will be present in the channel jarrett 1984 other channel properties that affect channel roughness coefficients such as vegetation hu et al 2013 järvelä 2005 li et al 2015 and meandering dash and khatua 2016 gholami et al 2015 moharana and khatua 2014 have been considered in developing more accurate channel roughness predictions the influence of channel width expansion has also been mentioned by jarrett 1984 as having an impact on the estimate of roughness coefficients as poor roughness coefficient predictions were observed on reaches with significant width expansion since parameters were not equally available from all sources the potential use of channel width expansion sediment mobility and particle size other than the 84th percentile were eliminated to maintain consistency across all four data sets in addition the dimensionless froude and reynolds numbers were excluded eqs 7 and 8 display how both these dimensionless numbers rely on mean velocity and are therefore unsuitable for application in ungauged streams chow 1959 7 fr u gh 8 r e uh ν the developed model described herein was based on the input parameters friction slope sf and relative smoothness r d84 to fill in the gaps between sources with h and w rather than hydraulic radius a rectangular channel cross section was assumed and eq 9 was applied 9 r w h w 2 h the roughness coefficient predicted in this study is the darcy weisbach f as it is a dimensionless number that can be easily adopted into both si and imperial units eq 6 was used to convert the observed n from the data sets to the darcy weisbach friction factor 2 3 gene expression programming evolutionary algorithms eas and genetic programming gp are techniques that develop a solution by determining the fittest individual through the elimination of poor solutions similar to the darwinian theory of evolution sattar and gharabaghi 2015 gene expression programming gep is the succession of genetic algorithms while eas and gps solely replicate gep is unique in its ability to evolve over generations ferreira 2001 teodorescu and sherwood 2008 azamathulla 2012 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 khozani et al 2017 the gep algorithms consist of chromosomes of set lengths which encode the expression tree that provides the ability for genetic modifications ferreira 2001 teodorescu and sherwood 2008 the first generation of randomly distributed functions and terminals in the chromosomes is called the parent through the evolution and mutation of high performing genetic operators subsequent offspring yield better fitness solutions that are more adaptable to the environment atieh et al 2017 ferreira 2001 sabouri et al 2016 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 sattar et al 2016 teodorescu and sherwood 2008 the evolution continues for a number of generations until an offspring emerges with an acceptable level of fitness atieh et al 2017 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 the gep learning environment is defined to develop a gep based model through five main steps in the first step the fitness function is defined due to the successful performance of the root relative squared error function in recent hydraulic and hydrologic studies khozani et al 2017 gholami et al 2018a b fitness is determined by the fitness function of the program fi 10 f i 1000 1 r r s e j fitness ranges from 0 to 1000 where 1000 is a perfect fit atieh et al 2017 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 thompson et al 2016 the root relative squared error rrsej is described in eq 11 and a result of zero indicates a perfect fit atieh et al 2017 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 11 rrs e j i 1 n p ij o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where pij is the predicted value for an individual offspring and oi is the corresponding observed value further information on gep can be found in ferreira 2001 in order to generate chromosomes the terminal t and function f sets are defined in the second step the function set in this study is defined based on arithmetic and mathematical operators the mathematical parameters were determined through a trial and error process by running a number of models and evaluating the accuracy and the complexity of the developed model the selected mathematical operators in this study are x2 ln x the terminal set consists of two dimensionless variables sf log r d84 the chromosomal architecture is defined in the third step by the specification of head length and number of genes the head length number of chromosomes and number of genes can range from 2 to 10 30 to 400 and 1 to 5 respectively after considering different combinations of these adjustable variables and monitoring the results in the training and testing stages the optimum results attained for head length number of chromosomes and number of genes were determined to be 7 300 and 3 respectively in the fourth step a function is determined to link different genes there are four linking functions considered in gep namely division multiplication subtraction and addition all of these functions were tested and the results indicated that the optimum model is obtained by considering addition as the linking function the results obtained for the best linking function are consistent with previous studies ebtehaj et al 2015a khozani et al 2017 gholami et al 2018a b finally the value of genetic operators such as inversion transposition mutation and recombination are determined in the fifth step through a trial and error process the optimum values for these operators are presented in the table 1 2 4 extreme learning machine elm huang et al 2004 introduced a novel training algorithm for a single layer feedforward neural network slffnn referred to as extreme learning machine elm to overcome the limitations of gradient based algorithms such as the low learning rate and low training speed that result from iterative adjustments of network parameters elm randomly selects the hidden nodes and the output weights of the slffnn are determined analytically using the moore penrose generalized inverse huang et al 2006 considering n arbitrary training samples as x i y i r n r m i 1 2 n with l hidden nodes the slffnn models with f x as the activation function are presented as liu et al 2016 12 i 1 l β i f i x j i 1 l β i f i a i b i x j 1 2 n where a i a i 1 a i 2 a in t is the matrix of input weights which is linked with hidden layer nodes bi is the bias of the hidden layer nodes and β i β i 1 β i 2 β im t is the matrix of the output weights which is linked to the hidden layer nodes eq 9 can be rewritten in the matrix form as 13 i 1 l β i f i x j h β where 14 h f a 1 b 1 x 1 f a l b l x 1 f a 1 b 1 x

the random determination of input weight a and the hidden node bias b in the training stage after specifying these weights and biases the matrix of the hidden layer is attained using input variables after determination of input weights and biases of the hidden layer the slffnn training is transformed to the least square solution by applying the regularization theory for elm models the target function is defined as 17 min l elm 1 2 β 2 c 2 t h β 2 2 5 model performance evaluation the prediction error was statistically analyzed using the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square

influential in predicting the friction factor the marginal sensitivity was calculated using eq 22 22 s c δ y δ x where δx is the change between the mean input parameter of interest and a 10 perturbation from the mean and δy is the change in the output for the target parameter perturbation the other parameter is maintained at its mean value atieh et al 2015 sabouri et al 2016 in order to establish a basis for comparison between the parameters the marginal sensitivity was normalized using eq 23 23 s n s c x y 2 7 parametric analysis sensitivity graphs were created for each parameter these span the range of the parameter values and evaluate how a parameter influences the prediction of the friction factor for each model the friction slope minimum is 0 00005 and the maximum value is 0 0403 with a mean of 0 00734 the relative smoothness term minimum is 0 41 and the maximum value is 3 38 with a mean of 0 76 3 results in the current study the generalization ability of two ai based models were checked using k fold cross validation roushangar et al 2014 applied this practical technique for complete scanning of the used data and for avoiding of the over fitting problem during training process in this technique all data are randomly categorized in k sub samples of the k sub samples is involved as test data to verify the model performance and the remaining k 1 samples comprise the training data the cross validation process is then repeated k times with each of the k sub samples utilized exactly once as validation the value of k in this study is assigned to be 5 one of the five sub samples is retained for validation while the others are employed in the training stage that means each time 20 of total available data 83 samples is considered for testing stage and the process is repeated so that entire data set is used as a blind test once therefore total 5 fold test per input combination per model gep and elm have been performed in the present study this process is repeated k times so that each sub sample is utilized once as a validation sample ebtehaj et al 2016 four statistical indices r2 rmse esn and mape were employed to compare the performance of the different models table 2 recapitulate the statistical parameters obtained for the gep and elm models using k fold cross validation technique as shown in this table the results of all sub simples are close to each other which demonstrate both gep and elm models are independent of the training and testing data sets which affirmed the generality of both models however it is observed the results of k 5 and k 1 correspond to the best results though the obtained equation by the k 1 was simpler than k 5 this model was selected as the best model the gep model output is an explicit formulation the equation extracted from the gep model for the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f is given as 24 1 f 0 355 s f 2 s f 1 log r d 84 1 044 l n 0 519 s f 2 l n log r d 84 s f 4 713 9 s f 2 log r d 84 2 by substituting eq 24 into eqs 4 and 6 the n and c values can be estimated accordingly moreover the optimum elm based model obtained by the sigmoid activation function and 40 hidden neurons is 25 1 f 1 1 exp i n w i n v b h n t o u t w where inw inv outw and bhn are the matrices of input weight input variable output weight and bias of hidden neurons respectively the value of these matrices for the

707 e 10 5 848 e 08 2 305 e 10 by calculating the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f from the proposed equation the value of the manning n and chezy c coefficients can be estimated from eqs 6 and 4 respectively the proposed models were compared to past models by limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 listed in table 3 which were all developed with similar parameters and are suitable for use with ungauged streams an accurate estimation of the energy losses between sections is crucial in non uniform flow in such cases the energy equation balance between two cross sections may be solved to obtain an estimation of the energy loss slope sf in an attempt to better fit the past models to the compiled data set re calibrated versions of the past equations were created by changing the coefficients using the solver function in excel to minimize the rmse value 3 1 performance analysis fig 1 displays the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f prediction results using the gep and elm models and the re calibrated models of limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 respectively for the four data sets used in this study fig 1 illustrates the prediction scatter of each model and shows the greater accuracy of the developed gep and elm models compared to those developed by limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 statistical indices were employed to quantitatively survey the accuracy of each model in predicting 1 f the error analysis results from table 4 demonstrate the statistical strength of the new models for the compiled data set note that the past models were developed based on a subset of the present study s data set in an effort to correct for resulting errors modified versions of the models were created that took the entire data set into account but the re calibrated models did not out perform the new models fig 1 shows that the proposed gep and elm model data compress around the 1 1 line with a high data correlation percentage the r2 coefficient for the gep and elm models were 0 76 and 0 78 respectively that these r values are higher than those achieved when running the limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 models suggests a relatively high ai based model prediction accuracy the accuracy of the elm model r2 0 78 rmse 0 52 esn 0 78 mape 16 42 is slightly higher than that of the gep r2 0 76 rmse 0 56 esn 0 76 mape 17 55 but the proposed gep based equation is simpler than the equation output from the elm the advantage of gep related to elm is that the gep model has potential as a simple model while the elm based model is more complex and the number of hidden neurons i e complexity of the model is defined by the user in general the gep based model in this study has only nine different constant values while elm has 160 that are optimized through the training process table 4 indicates that the mape value for the ai based models was the lowest among all models the value of this index for gep and elm is 10 less than the original value of the bathurst 1985 model which is the best available model ultimately the values of the remaining indices for all models confirm that the proposed gep and elm models outperform the limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 models in estimating the darcy weisbach friction factor table 4 also suggests that using the combined larger data set to re calibrate the jarrett 1984 model that was developed for high gradient streams had more impact on model performance than the same recalibration performed on the limerinos 1970 and bathurst 1985 models as little difference was noted between the indices in the latter two relatively good predictions were observed in all previous models using the original small individual data sets however when using the combined larger data set these models exhibited a high error implying limitations for these models when applied to similar practical cases 3 2 sensitivity analysis the marginal sensitivity was evaluated to determine which parameters have the greatest influence on the prediction of the friction factor the normalized sensitivity for the log r d84 data was 0 3483 and 0 4923 for the gep and elm models respectively and for sf was 0 1013 and 0 1836 for the gep and elm models respectively 4 discussion 4 1 performance analysis the models by limerinos 1970 and bathurst 1985 exclude the slope while the model by jarrett 1984 excludes the d84 given that s accounts for the additional energy losses not directly captured in the r d84 either parameter could influence the prediction of the friction factor suggesting the need for a model that includes both terms the gep model presented here includes all key parameters to reduce the error in predicting the friction factor over a wide range of channel conditions the outliers in fig 1 for the jarrett 1984 bathurst 1985 and limerinos 1970 models are caused by conditions outside of the range of parameters of the original data sets fig 2 illustrates the range of the input parameter values and the type of stream conditions included in each data set the bottom right represents high gradient streams with low relative roughness the bottom left represents smooth high gradient streams and the upper left section of the graph represents smooth low gradient streams all existing empirical models were developed using limited field datasets to perform under specific hydrologic conditions and therefore they exhibit large prediction error for the friction factor for streams outside of their target conditions the gep and elm models perform better due to their ability to predict the friction factor for smooth low gradient channels 4 2 sensitivity analysis in the model the friction factor was positively sensitive to a positive change in relative smoothness and negatively sensitive to a positive change in slope the friction factor is slightly more sensitive to the friction slope which implies that the channel slope is to some extent more important to consider when applying the new model at mean values the models by limerinos 1970 and bathurst 1985 exclude slope but based on the sensitivity analysis of the new models the friction slope plays an important role in predicting the friction factor low slope channels that are also very smooth would not be sensitive to changes in bed material and therefore the friction factor and mean velocity would be more sensitive to changes in friction slope low relative smoothness ratios would occur under conditions of small hydraulic radius such as very shallow channels or in situations with very large d84 particles in which there is a significant roughness produced by the channel bed material this finding is supported by previous high gradient and gravel bed studies bathurst 1985 cheng 2014 colosimo et al 1988 jarrett 1984 high gradient streams such as those in mountainous terrain are often shallow and full of boulders under these conditions the bed properties play a larger role in channel roughness jarrett 1984 the combination of the friction slope and relative smoothness parameters allows the model to predict the friction factor for both deep low slope channels and shallow high gradient channels the friction factor prediction is driven by the parameter that is most sensitive under the conditions particular to the type of channel 4 3 partial derivative sensitivity analysis pdsa in this study the trend variation of the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f is analyzed using partial derivative sensitivity analysis pdsa ebtehaj et al 2015b 2018 in the pdsa technique the partial derivative of the target parameter i e in this study 1 f relative to each input variable i e in this study log r d84 and sf is calculated to survey the sensitivity of the model i e gep and elm to each input parameter a smaller or higher pdsa value denotes a smaller or higher impact of the desired input variable on the results of the proposed model a positive or negative pdsa value for an input variable indicates that an increase in the desired input variable log r d84 or sf results in an increase or decrease in the target variable 1 f the pdsa results of the gep and elm models are presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively the new models for the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f show higher sensitivity to the sf in milder streams fig 4 shows the high sensitivity of the gep based equation to small values of sf such that the sensitivity values varied from 20 000 to 120 000 for higher value of sf sf 0 01 the sensitivity of the gep based equation to this parameter is very low conversely pdsa results for sf 0 01 are negative implying that a small increase in value of sf leads to a high reduction in 1 f the results of pdsa for log r d84 demonstrate that the sensitivity of the gep based equation to log r d84 is in the range of 20 to 140 which is very low compared to the results for sf the trend variation of log r d84 3 is linear with a downward slope for higher values of this parameter the trend variation follows a second order relationship with a downward slope for the collected samples in this study most of the sensitivity values for log r d84 are positive which demonstrate a direct relationship between this variable and the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f calculated by the proposed gep based equation as with the gep model the pdsa results for the elm model indicate a high sensitivity of the proposed matrix based equation for prediction of 1 f to the sf parameter the pdsa output for low sf values sf 0 01 suggests extreme sensitivity while for sf 0 01 the sensitivity values are very low the darcy weisbach friction factor variation with sf is complex so that the pdsa yields both negative and positive sensitivity values across the range of sf values 4 4 uncertainty analysis in this sub section the quantitative assessment of the ai based techniques gep and elm versus past models that have been studied is presented using uncertainty analysis ua ebtehaj et al 2017 shaghaghi et al 2017 to apply ua some concepts should be defined in this method the individual prediction error ipe is calculated by differencing the predicted and observed values as ipe pi oi the ipe is employed to compute its mean and standard deviation mipe ipe k 1 n ip e k and sdipe k 1 n ipe e k m i p e 2 n 1 respectively the positive or negative mipe value shows the prediction model overestimating or underestimating the observed darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f a confidence band is defined by mpei and sdpei around the predicted values using the wilson score method without continuity correction wsmwcc so that the 1 96 sdpei approximately results in a 95 confidence band the results of ua mpei sdpei width of uncertainty band wub and 95 prediction interval error pei are summarized in table 5 the results in table 5 indicate that the developed gep and elm models performed better than the previous models as they yield a lower computed uncertainty the mipe for the gep and elm models are 0 0398 and 0 0001 respectively which shows that both models underestimated the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f while the limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 models overestimated 1 f the gep and elm models had the least sdipe at 0 5557 and 0 5225 respectively while the original jarrett 1984 model had the highest sdipe at 2 247 the wub for the original past models ranged from 0 09795 to 0 217 the wub range for the re calibrated past models was similar with values ranging from 0 07245 to 0 0771 the wub value for the ai based models is lower than that of the limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 models with the elm model having the lowest wub value at 0 0504 this is 2 3 of the lowest wub value for the past models namely the re calibrated jarrett 1984 model with a wub value of 0 07245 correspondingly the lowest 95 pei was detected for the ai based models 5 conclusions the ability to accurately predict the friction factor is important for developing stage discharge relationships for ungauged streams this study employed a large global dataset and machine learning tools to improve existing empirical roughness coefficient models for ungauged streams data sets compiled from jarrett 1984 bathurst 1985 colosimo et al 1988 and hicks and mason 1998 including 415 streamflow events collected from 52 rivers across three continents were used to develop novel gep and elm models with significantly improved accuracy compared to all existing friction factor prediction models for ungauged streams existing models described in the literature were applicable for specific purposes under a limited range of conditions while the new models explored here were developed using a more extensive data set and powerful machine learning tools this led to the inclusion of additional parameters and more complex equations than with the past models resulting in improved friction factor prediction accuracy particularly for smooth low gradient streams friction depends on two main non dimensional input parameters including channel slope sf and bed material relative smoothness log r d84 each input parameter is key in different channel scenarios highlighting the need for the inclusion of both in order for the model to provide valid estimations for a wide range of channel conditions the gep and elm models are computationally explicit equations and would be suitable for estimating the friction factor in practice the results of the pdsa show the greater sensitivity of the proposed gep and elm models to sf in comparison to relative smoothness log r d84 the new models for the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f show higher sensitivity to the sf in milder streams however the bed material size i e relative smoothness has the greatest effect on the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f which confirm the necessity of a field survey for bed material sampling to obtain an accurate estimation of the flow resistance parameter

6816,the most uncertain parameter in determining the stage discharge relationship of an ungauged stream is the friction factor a parameter for which a gauged stream can be back calculated using hydrometric survey data that has been compiled over a wide range of flow conditions the existing friction factor models for ungauged streams that do not require hydrometric survey data as input can have very large prediction errors in this study 415 streamflow events collected from 52 rivers across three continents were assembled to allow for the use of a suitable global dataset size range to develop a robust model for the prediction of the friction factor in ungauged streams using two machine learning algorithms gene expression programing gep and extreme learning machine elm the new gep and elm models outperformed existing models with significantly improved r squared values of 0 76 and 0 78 respectively the combination of the two input parameters relative smoothness and the friction slope allowed the new models to more accurately predict the friction factor for a wider range of streams and flow conditions the forecasting uncertainty of the developed gep and elm models were compared with past models and found to be the least uncertain with width uncertainty band wub values of 0 0536 and 0 0504 respectively for the first time in this field of research partial derivative sensitivity analysis was applied to the trends of the friction factor estimation by gep and elm it was found that gep and elm models are extremely sensitive to friction slope in comparison with relative smoothness the gep and elm model results for predicting the darcy weisbach friction factor were compared with different existing relationships and the superior performance of the proposed

directly measured jiang and li 2010 julien 2002 in pipe flow scenarios the assignment of roughness is more straightforward as it can be calculated based on controlled experiments e g chow 1959 keulegan 1938 it is much more complex to estimate roughness in open channel flow due to dynamic and irregular channel bed properties gazendam et al 2016 kitsikoudis et al 2015 moharana and khatua 2014 powell 2014 estimating an accurate roughness coefficient is important when developing flood models stage discharge models or designing channel infrastructure horritt 2000 kazemian kale kale et al 2018 gholami et al 2018a b moharana and khatua 2014 wohl 1998 the difficulty in quantifying roughness coefficients often leads to its use as a calibration parameter in hydraulic flood modelling pappenberger et al 2005 wilson et al 2006 the manning formula listed in eq 1 was developed as a modification of the chezy formula to predict the mean velocity u for steady turbulent flow as a function of the hydraulic radius r energy slope sf and manning coefficient n the manning formula is the most commonly used resistance equation in open channel flow bjerklie et al 2005 chow 1959 keulegan 1938 1 u 1 n r 2 3 s f 1 2 with the simplifying assumption of uniform flow sf is approximated by the water slope limerinos 1970 applied the regression method to propose an equation for the estimation of n as a function of hydraulic radius r and the diameter d84 for which 84 of the streambed particles are smaller as follows in si 2 n 0 1129 r 1 6 1 16 2 log r d 84 for higher gradient streams jarrett 1984 proposed the following equation 3 n 0 39 s f 0 38 r 0 16 the value of n can be converted to the value of chezy c by the following equation 4 c r 1 6 n the darcy weisbach friction factor f in eq 5 is a dimensionless representation of the flow resistance where g is gravity although it is more frequently used in pipe flow rather than channel flow the relationship between discharge and roughness is similar to that of chezy s c and manning s n hessel et al 2003 julien 2002 keulegan 1938 5 u 8 g f r 2 3 s f 1 2 the relationship between the manning and the darcy weisbach equations is demonstrated in eq 6 6 1 f r 1 6 n 8 g 1 1 existing models the manning chézy and the darcy weisbach equations all predict friction factors based on the friction slope hydraulic radius and mean velocity to capture channel bed properties strickler 1923 and keulegan 1938 both developed models to predict manning s n that include the mean bed grain size diameter d 50 similarly the models by limerinos 1970 and bathurst 1985 predict channel roughness as a function of the 84th percentile grain size diameter d 84 the models by limerinos 1970 and bathurst 1985 exclude mean velocity which makes them suitable for use with ungauged streams jarrett 1984 developed a model to predict the roughness coefficient for high gradient streams conditions under which it is challenging to measure mean velocity the model is a function of friction slope and hydraulic radius the complex channel and surface properties that influence surface roughness are often challenging to measure choo et al 2014 rosgen 1994 in an attempt to estimate channel roughness based on river classification visual guides and look up tables have been developed to correlate the roughness coefficient to visual indicators such as the presence of vegetation boulders or meandering conditions e g see barnes 1967 chow 1959 rosgen 1994 this qualitative technique has limitations as each river reach has complex and specific geometry that cannot be identified through an image azamathulla et al 2013 forzieri et al 2010 hicks and mason 1998 jiang and li 2010 powell 2014 rosgen 1994 the bed form that is manifested has a direct impact on the resistance to flow phillips and tadayon 2006 therefore a reliable estimate of the n value requires knowledge of flow hydraulics and the geometry of channels in addition to sufficient field data such as bed material sizes in recent decades data driven methods have been developed that offer an alternative approach to solve nonlinear problems compared to previous methods for modelling complex phenomena more recent models have incorporated additional input parameters azamathulla et al 2013 included the froude number reynolds number and equivalent wall roughness azamathulla 2013 incorporated sediment properties such as shape factor grain size and critical depth in addition to the froude number that requires flow velocity measurements and hydrometric surveys not available for ungauged sites the genetic programming model developed by roushangar et al 2014 predicts the roughness coefficient as a function of the slope of the free surface reynolds number and relative smoothness artificial intelligence ai techniques such as gene expression programming gep are useful for accurate prediction of hydraulic phenomena techniques such as gep have reasonable calculation times and have become popular with researchers e g guven and gunal 2008 ghani and azamathulla 2011 mohammadpour et al 2013 ebtehaj et al 2015a sheikh et al 2016 azimi et al 2017 bonakdari et al 2018 sattar et al 2018 as gep facilitates the precise prediction of hydraulic phenomena in addition gep has the capacity to create an explicit equation for predicting variables a powerful advantage of this method for practical applications another popular and effective ai based technique is the extreme learning machine elm elm is a non tuned fast technique ebtehaj and bonakdari 2016 the training speed in this approach is generally very fast comparably higher than the training speeds of gep and other popular ai based techniques such as artificial neural networks support vector machines and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems ebtehaj et al 2018 moreover in modeling a nonlinear complex model with elm the user need only tune one parameter and the number of hidden neurons while in other ai techniques there are many adjustable parameters with values on which the performance of the model is highly dependent 1 2 research objective the goal of this study is to determine if larger global datasets and machine learning tools can be used to improve existing empirical roughness coefficient models for ungauged streams the current research focuses on ungauged streams and therefore models that do not use flow velocity or other parameters that rely on flow velocity such as the froude number as model input machine learning tools namely gene expression programming gep and extreme learning machine elm are trained with a large global data set to develop new models based on a limited number of physical characteristic parameters these new models are then applied to ungauged streams the proposed equations based on gep and elm are compared to existing empirical models that do not require hydrometric data models that incorporate input parameters that are not available in the compiled data set were excluded from the comparison moreover the trends of friction factor estimation calculated by gep and elm are analysed by partial derivative sensitivity analysis for the first time in this field and the uncertainty of the developed models is also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrometric data in order to produce a robust model hydrometric data from four sources were compiled and assembled into consistent units the study by jarrett 1984 focused on 21 high gradient rivers s 0 002 in the colorado rocky mountains with a dataset of 69 observations these natural stream sites covered a large area from piedra river with a latitude of 37 13 20 to elk river with a latitude of 40 43 03 and arkansas river with a longitude of 106 12 46 to hermosa creek with a longitude of 107 50 40 the morphology of these high gradient natural streams was relatively straight and uniform with little vegetation present and stable channel bed and banks the data ranges measured in jarrett s 1984 tests for computing the darcy weisbach friction factor were as follows 0 15 r m 1 68 0 002 s f 0 034 0 16 h m 1 94 0 09 d 84 m 0 79 where r is the hydraulic radius s f is the friction slope h is the mean channel depth and d 84 is the diameter of the 84th percentile of particle distribution similarly bathurst 1985 focused on high gradient streams in the united kingdom specifically examining gravel beds with a dataset of 41 observations in 16 sites in the upland british rivers the climate of the area was cool and wet with mean annual rainfall ranging from 1000 to 3000 mm these reaches were situated either in riffle sections between pool structures or in mountain reaches with no defined riffle pool sequence and minimal vegetation the data ranges in bathurst s 1985 experiments were as follows 0 1 r m 1 18 0 004 s f 0 0373 0 1 h m 1 31 0 11 d 84 m 0 74 colosimo et al 1988 focused on channels with shallow flow and gravel beds with 42 observations in streams in calabria southern italy the climate of the area was mediterranean with considerable differences in temperature and rainfall between seasons these streams were relatively uniform with little vegetation present on the bed and the banks the data ranges measured in colosimo et al s 1988 experiments were as follows 0 23 r m 0 55 0 0026 s f 0 0190 0 26 h m 0 58 0 04 d 84 m 0 12 hicks and mason 1998 cover a wide range of rivers throughout new zealand with no specific target range for any parameters and documented 461 observations over 78 river reaches data was collected predominantly in temperate zones with a maritime climate a subset of 263 observations was used in developing the model these streams were relatively straight with vegetation present on the banks in most of the study reaches the data ranges in hicks and mason s 1998 test were as follows 0 18 r m 9 17 0 001 s f 0 0403 0 18 h m 10 63 0 d 84 m 1 26 2 2 parameter selection repeatedly throughout the technical literature there is an emphasis on grain size distribution slope and channel geometry butler et al 2015 ferguson 2007 julien 2002 roushangar et al 2014 channel geometry has an influence on the roughness coefficient as the extent of surface boundary conditions will affect the extent of shear stress on the channel velocity colosimo et al 1988 keulegan 1938 numerous studies have developed relationships between grain size distribution and channel roughness coefficients azamathulla and jarrett 2013 chow 1959 sturm and tuzson 2001 keulegan 1938 and strickler 1923 both developed models based on the mean grain size diameter but the study by limerinos 1970 emphasized that the 84th percentile produced simpler and slightly more accurate results than the mean diameter the 84th percentile is a grain size that has been subsequently adopted for roughness coefficient models azamathulla and jarrett 2013 azamathulla 2013 ferguson 2007 in addition some studies have applied the relative roughness or relative smoothness term expressed as a dimensionless number of h d84 or r d84 using this technique particle size distribution plays a role in predicting roughness when the depth is low or the particle diameter size is large bathurst 1985 cheng 2014 colosimo et al 1988 roushangar et al 2014 the chezy and manning formulae were based on the energy slope choo et al 2014 friction slope is relatively consistent with energy slopes on low slope channels and in high gradient streams where the emphasis is on bed material friction slope plays a larger role in estimating roughness as it is a predictor of which type of bed material will be present in the channel jarrett 1984 other channel properties that affect channel roughness coefficients such as vegetation hu et al 2013 järvelä 2005 li et al 2015 and meandering dash and khatua 2016 gholami et al 2015 moharana and khatua 2014 have been considered in developing more accurate channel roughness predictions the influence of channel width expansion has also been mentioned by jarrett 1984 as having an impact on the estimate of roughness coefficients as poor roughness coefficient predictions were observed on reaches with significant width expansion since parameters were not equally available from all sources the potential use of channel width expansion sediment mobility and particle size other than the 84th percentile were eliminated to maintain consistency across all four data sets in addition the dimensionless froude and reynolds numbers were excluded eqs 7 and 8 display how both these dimensionless numbers rely on mean velocity and are therefore unsuitable for application in ungauged streams chow 1959 7 fr u gh 8 r e uh ν the developed model described herein was based on the input parameters friction slope sf and relative smoothness r d84 to fill in the gaps between sources with h and w rather than hydraulic radius a rectangular channel cross section was assumed and eq 9 was applied 9 r w h w 2 h the roughness coefficient predicted in this study is the darcy weisbach f as it is a dimensionless number that can be easily adopted into both si and imperial units eq 6 was used to convert the observed n from the data sets to the darcy weisbach friction factor 2 3 gene expression programming evolutionary algorithms eas and genetic programming gp are techniques that develop a solution by determining the fittest individual through the elimination of poor solutions similar to the darwinian theory of evolution sattar and gharabaghi 2015 gene expression programming gep is the succession of genetic algorithms while eas and gps solely replicate gep is unique in its ability to evolve over generations ferreira 2001 teodorescu and sherwood 2008 azamathulla 2012 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 khozani et al 2017 the gep algorithms consist of chromosomes of set lengths which encode the expression tree that provides the ability for genetic modifications ferreira 2001 teodorescu and sherwood 2008 the first generation of randomly distributed functions and terminals in the chromosomes is called the parent through the evolution and mutation of high performing genetic operators subsequent offspring yield better fitness solutions that are more adaptable to the environment atieh et al 2017 ferreira 2001 sabouri et al 2016 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 sattar et al 2016 teodorescu and sherwood 2008 the evolution continues for a number of generations until an offspring emerges with an acceptable level of fitness atieh et al 2017 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 the gep learning environment is defined to develop a gep based model through five main steps in the first step the fitness function is defined due to the successful performance of the root relative squared error function in recent hydraulic and hydrologic studies khozani et al 2017 gholami et al 2018a b fitness is determined by the fitness function of the program fi 10 f i 1000 1 r r s e j fitness ranges from 0 to 1000 where 1000 is a perfect fit atieh et al 2017 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 thompson et al 2016 the root relative squared error rrsej is described in eq 11 and a result of zero indicates a perfect fit atieh et al 2017 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 11 rrs e j i 1 n p ij o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where pij is the predicted value for an individual offspring and oi is the corresponding observed value further information on gep can be found in ferreira 2001 in order to generate chromosomes the terminal t and function f sets are defined in the second step the function set in this study is defined based on arithmetic and mathematical operators the mathematical parameters were determined through a trial and error process by running a number of models and evaluating the accuracy and the complexity of the developed model the selected mathematical operators in this study are x2 ln x the terminal set consists of two dimensionless variables sf log r d84 the chromosomal architecture is defined in the third step by the specification of head length and number of genes the head length number of chromosomes and number of genes can range from 2 to 10 30 to 400 and 1 to 5 respectively after considering different combinations of these adjustable variables and monitoring the results in the training and testing stages the optimum results attained for head length number of chromosomes and number of genes were determined to be 7 300 and 3 respectively in the fourth step a function is determined to link different genes there are four linking functions considered in gep namely division multiplication subtraction and addition all of these functions were tested and the results indicated that the optimum model is obtained by considering addition as the linking function the results obtained for the best linking function are consistent with previous studies ebtehaj et al 2015a khozani et al 2017 gholami et al 2018a b finally the value of genetic operators such as inversion transposition mutation and recombination are determined in the fifth step through a trial and error process the optimum values for these operators are presented in the table 1 2 4 extreme learning machine elm huang et al 2004 introduced a novel training algorithm for a single layer feedforward neural network slffnn referred to as extreme learning machine elm to overcome the limitations of gradient based algorithms such as the low learning rate and low training speed that result from iterative adjustments of network parameters elm randomly selects the hidden nodes and the output weights of the slffnn are determined analytically using the moore penrose generalized inverse huang et al 2006 considering n arbitrary training samples as x i y i r n r m i 1 2 n with l hidden nodes the slffnn models with f x as the activation function are presented as liu et al 2016 12 i 1 l β i f i x j i 1 l β i f i a i b i x j 1 2 n where a i a i 1 a i 2 a in t is the matrix of input weights which is linked with hidden layer nodes bi is the bias of the hidden layer nodes and β i β i 1 β i 2 β im t is the matrix of the output weights which is linked to the hidden layer nodes eq 9 can be rewritten in the matrix form as 13 i 1 l β i f i x j h β where 14 h f a 1 b 1 x 1 f a l b l x 1 f a 1 b 1 x n f a l b l x n n l 15 β β 1 t β l t l m 16 t y 1 t y l t n m where h is the output matrix of the hidden layer β is the output weight matrix and t is the label matrix in this model the first step is the random determination of input weight a and the hidden node bias b in the training stage after specifying these weights and biases the matrix of the hidden layer is attained using input variables after determination of input weights and biases of the hidden layer the slffnn training is transformed to the least square solution by applying the regularization theory for elm models the target function is defined as 17 min l elm 1 2 β 2 c 2 t h β 2 2 5 model performance evaluation the prediction error was statistically analyzed using the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square

influential in predicting the friction factor the marginal sensitivity was calculated using eq 22 22 s c δ y δ x where δx is the change between the mean input parameter of interest and a 10 perturbation from the mean and δy is the change in the output for the target parameter perturbation the other parameter is maintained at its mean value atieh et al 2015 sabouri et al 2016 in order to establish a basis for comparison between the parameters the marginal sensitivity was normalized using eq 23 23 s n s c x y 2 7 parametric analysis sensitivity graphs were created for each parameter these span the range of the parameter values and evaluate how a parameter influences the prediction of the friction factor for each model the friction slope minimum is 0 00005 and the maximum value is 0 0403 with a mean of 0 00734 the relative smoothness term minimum is 0 41 and the maximum value is 3 38 with a mean of 0 76 3 results in the current study the generalization ability of two ai based models were checked using k fold cross validation roushangar et al 2014 applied this practical technique for complete scanning of the used data and for avoiding of the over fitting problem during training process in this technique all data are randomly categorized in k sub samples of the k sub samples is involved as test data to verify the model performance and the remaining k 1 samples comprise the training data the cross validation process is then repeated k times with each of the k sub samples utilized exactly once as validation the value of k in this study is assigned to be 5 one of the five sub samples is retained for validation while the others are employed in the training stage that means each time 20 of total available data 83 samples is considered for testing stage and the process is repeated so that entire data set is used as a blind test once therefore total 5 fold test per input combination per model gep and elm have been performed in the present study this process is repeated k times so that each sub sample is utilized once as a validation sample ebtehaj et al 2016 four statistical indices r2 rmse esn and mape were employed to compare the performance of the different models table 2 recapitulate the statistical parameters obtained for the gep and elm models using k fold cross validation technique as shown in this table the results of all sub simples are close to each other which demonstrate both gep and elm models are independent of the training and testing data sets which affirmed the generality of both models however it is observed the results of k 5 and k 1 correspond to the best results though the obtained equation by the k 1 was simpler than k 5 this model was selected as the best model the gep model output is an explicit formulation the equation extracted from the gep model for the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f is given as 24 1 f 0 355 s f 2 s f 1 log r d 84 1 044 l n 0 519 s f 2 l n log r d 84 s f 4 713 9 s f 2 log r d 84 2 by substituting eq 24 into eqs 4 and 6 the n and c values can be estimated accordingly moreover the optimum elm based model obtained by the sigmoid activation function and 40 hidden neurons is 25 1 f 1 1

707 e 10 5 848 e 08 2 305 e 10 by calculating the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f from the proposed equation the value of the manning n and chezy c coefficients can be estimated from eqs 6 and 4 respectively the proposed models were compared to past models by limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 listed in table 3 which were all developed with similar parameters and are suitable for use with ungauged streams an accurate estimation of the energy losses between sections is crucial in non uniform flow in such cases the energy equation balance between two cross sections may be solved to obtain an estimation of the energy loss slope sf in an attempt to better fit the past models to the compiled data set re calibrated versions of the past equations were created by changing the coefficients using the solver function in excel to minimize the rmse value 3 1 performance analysis fig 1 displays the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f prediction results using the gep and elm models and the re calibrated models of limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 respectively for the four data sets used in this study fig 1 illustrates the prediction scatter of each model and shows the greater accuracy of the developed gep and elm models compared to those developed by limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 statistical indices were employed to quantitatively survey the accuracy of each model in predicting 1 f the error analysis results from table 4 demonstrate the statistical strength of the new models for the compiled data set note that the past models were developed based on a subset of the present study s data set in an effort to correct for resulting errors modified versions of the models were created that took the entire data set into account but the re calibrated models did not out perform the new models fig 1 shows that the proposed gep and elm model data compress around the 1 1 line with a high data correlation percentage the r2 coefficient for the gep and elm models were 0 76 and 0 78 respectively that these r values are higher than those achieved when running the limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 models suggests a relatively high ai based model prediction accuracy the accuracy of the elm model r2 0 78 rmse 0 52 esn 0 78 mape 16 42 is slightly higher than that of the gep r2 0 76 rmse 0 56 esn 0 76 mape 17 55 but the proposed gep based equation is simpler than the equation output from the elm the advantage of gep related to elm is that the gep model has potential as a simple model while the elm based model is more complex and the number of hidden neurons i e complexity of the model is defined by the user in general the gep based model in this study has only nine different constant values while elm has 160 that are optimized through the training process table 4 indicates that the mape value for the ai based models was the lowest among all models the value of this index for gep and elm is 10 less than the original value of the bathurst 1985 model which is the best available model ultimately the values of the remaining indices for all models confirm that the proposed gep and elm models outperform the limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 models in estimating the darcy weisbach friction factor table 4 also suggests that using the combined larger data set to re calibrate the jarrett 1984 model that was developed for high gradient streams had more impact on model performance than the same recalibration performed on the limerinos 1970 and bathurst 1985 models as little difference was noted between the indices in the latter two relatively good predictions were observed in all previous models using the original small individual data sets however when using the combined larger data set these models exhibited a high error implying limitations for these models when applied to similar practical cases 3 2 sensitivity analysis the marginal sensitivity was evaluated to determine which parameters have the greatest influence on the prediction of the friction factor the normalized sensitivity for the log r d84 data was 0 3483 and 0 4923 for the gep and elm models respectively and for sf was 0 1013 and 0 1836 for the gep and elm models respectively 4 discussion 4 1 performance analysis the models by limerinos 1970 and bathurst 1985 exclude the slope while the model by jarrett 1984 excludes the d84 given that s accounts for the additional energy losses not directly captured in the r d84 either parameter could influence the prediction of the friction factor suggesting the need for a model that includes both terms the gep model presented here includes all key parameters to reduce the error in predicting the friction factor over a wide range of channel conditions the outliers in fig 1 for the jarrett 1984 bathurst 1985 and limerinos 1970 models are caused by conditions outside of the range of parameters of the original data sets fig 2 illustrates the range of the input parameter values and the type of stream conditions included in each data set the bottom right represents high gradient streams with low relative roughness the bottom left represents smooth high gradient streams and the upper left section of the graph represents smooth low gradient streams all existing empirical models were developed using limited field datasets to perform under specific hydrologic conditions and therefore they exhibit large prediction error for the friction factor for streams outside of their target conditions the gep and elm models perform better due to their ability to predict the friction factor for smooth low gradient channels 4 2 sensitivity analysis in the model the friction factor was positively sensitive to a positive change in relative smoothness and negatively sensitive to a positive change in slope the friction factor is slightly more sensitive to the friction slope which implies that the channel slope is to some extent more important to consider when applying the new model at mean values the models by limerinos 1970 and bathurst 1985 exclude slope but based on the sensitivity analysis of the new models the friction slope plays an important role in predicting the friction factor low slope channels that are also very smooth would not be sensitive to changes in bed material and therefore the friction factor and mean velocity would be more sensitive to changes in friction slope low relative smoothness ratios would occur under conditions of small hydraulic radius such as very shallow channels or in situations with very large d84 particles in which there is a significant roughness produced by the channel bed material this finding is supported by previous high gradient and gravel bed studies bathurst 1985 cheng 2014 colosimo et al 1988 jarrett 1984 high gradient streams such as those in mountainous terrain are often shallow and full of boulders under these conditions the bed properties play a larger role in channel roughness jarrett 1984 the combination of the friction slope and relative smoothness parameters allows the model to predict the friction factor for both deep low slope channels and shallow high gradient channels the friction factor prediction is driven by the parameter that is most sensitive under the conditions particular to the type of channel 4 3 partial derivative sensitivity analysis pdsa in this study the trend variation of the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f is analyzed using partial derivative sensitivity analysis pdsa ebtehaj et al 2015b 2018 in the pdsa technique the partial derivative of the target parameter i e in this study 1 f relative to each input variable i e in this study log r d84 and sf is calculated to survey the sensitivity of the model i e gep and elm to each input parameter a smaller or higher pdsa value denotes a smaller or higher impact of the desired input variable on the results of the proposed model a positive or negative pdsa value for an input variable indicates that an increase in the desired input variable log r d84 or sf results in an increase or decrease in the target variable 1 f the pdsa results of the gep and elm models are presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively the new models for the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f show higher sensitivity to the sf in milder streams fig 4 shows the high sensitivity of the gep based equation to small values of sf such that the sensitivity values varied from 20 000 to 120 000 for higher value of sf sf 0 01 the sensitivity of the gep based equation to this parameter is very low conversely pdsa results for sf 0 01 are negative implying that a small increase in value of sf leads to a high reduction in 1 f the results of pdsa for log r d84 demonstrate that the sensitivity of the gep based equation to log r d84 is in the range of 20 to 140 which is very low compared to the results for sf the trend variation of log r d84 3 is linear with a downward slope for higher values of this parameter the trend variation follows a second order relationship with a downward slope for the collected samples in this study most of the sensitivity values for log r d84 are positive which demonstrate a direct relationship between this variable and the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f calculated by the proposed gep based equation as with the gep model the pdsa results for the elm model indicate a high sensitivity of the proposed matrix based equation for prediction of 1 f to the sf parameter the pdsa output for low sf values sf 0 01 suggests extreme sensitivity while for sf 0 01 the sensitivity values are very low the darcy weisbach friction factor variation with sf is complex so that the pdsa yields both negative and positive sensitivity values across the range of sf values 4 4 uncertainty analysis in this sub section the quantitative assessment of the ai based techniques gep and elm versus past models that have been studied is presented using uncertainty analysis ua ebtehaj et al 2017 shaghaghi et al 2017 to apply ua some concepts should be defined in this method the individual prediction error ipe is calculated by differencing the predicted and observed values as ipe pi oi the ipe is employed to compute its mean and standard deviation mipe ipe k 1 n ip e k and sdipe k 1 n ipe e k m i p e 2 n 1 respectively the positive or negative mipe value shows the prediction model overestimating or underestimating the observed darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f a confidence band is defined by mpei and sdpei around the predicted values using the wilson score method without continuity correction wsmwcc so that the 1 96 sdpei approximately results in a 95 confidence band the results of ua mpei sdpei width of uncertainty band wub and 95 prediction interval error pei are summarized in table 5 the results in table 5 indicate that the developed gep and elm models performed better than the previous models as they yield a lower computed uncertainty the mipe for the gep and elm models are 0 0398 and 0 0001 respectively which shows that both models underestimated the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f while the limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 models overestimated 1 f the gep and elm models had the least sdipe at 0 5557 and 0 5225 respectively while the original jarrett 1984 model had the highest sdipe at 2 247 the wub for the original past models ranged from 0 09795 to 0 217 the wub range for the re calibrated past models was similar with values ranging from 0 07245 to 0 0771 the wub value for the ai based models is lower than that of the limerinos 1970 jarrett 1984 and bathurst 1985 models with the elm model having the lowest wub value at 0 0504 this is 2 3 of the lowest wub value for the past models namely the re calibrated jarrett 1984 model with a wub value of 0 07245 correspondingly the lowest 95 pei was detected for the ai based models 5 conclusions the ability to accurately predict the friction factor is important for developing stage discharge relationships for ungauged streams this study employed a large global dataset and machine learning tools to improve existing empirical roughness coefficient models for ungauged streams data sets compiled from jarrett 1984 bathurst 1985 colosimo et al 1988 and hicks and mason 1998 including 415 streamflow events collected from 52 rivers across three continents were used to develop novel gep and elm models with significantly improved accuracy compared to all existing friction factor prediction models for ungauged streams existing models described in the literature were applicable for specific purposes under a limited range of conditions while the new models explored here were developed using a more extensive data set and powerful machine learning tools this led to the inclusion of additional parameters and more complex equations than with the past models resulting in improved friction factor prediction accuracy particularly for smooth low gradient streams friction depends on two main non dimensional input parameters including channel slope sf and bed material relative smoothness log r d84 each input parameter is key in different channel scenarios highlighting the need for the inclusion of both in order for the model to provide valid estimations for a wide range of channel conditions the gep and elm models are computationally explicit equations and would be suitable for estimating the friction factor in practice the results of the pdsa show the greater sensitivity of the proposed gep and elm models to sf in comparison to relative smoothness log r d84 the new models for the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f show higher sensitivity to the sf in milder streams however the bed material size i e relative smoothness has the greatest effect on the darcy weisbach friction factor 1 f which confirm the necessity of a field survey for bed material sampling to obtain an accurate estimation of the flow resistance parameter

6817,due to the rapid decline of in situ observations on river discharge in arctic regions evaluation of the continental freshwater input to the arctic ocean has become problematic and necessitates the development of alternative approaches based on remote sensing radar altimetric satellites have demonstrated high potential for estimation of river water discharge compared to polar orbiting altimeters non polar orbit satellites have an advantage in temporal sampling their greatest drawback however is spatial coverage observations do not cover the low reaches of most parts of arctic rivers in this study of the lena river we demonstrate a way to overcome this limitation by using a combination of in situ observations from tributaries and satellite observations in the middle river reaches the water discharge as well as monthly and annual water flow were evaluated using three virtual stations direct combination of the water level from these virtual stations was not possible because of the difference in seasonal amplitude however the combination of altimetric discharge from the three independently processed tracks significantly improves the flow retrievals the accuracy of the monthly water flow estimates at the river outlet is 23 it increases with the integration time giving 7 for annual flow keywords radar altimetry jason2 3 freshwater input arctic rivers 1 introduction the lena river is the second largest by flow arctic river with water contribution of about 556 km3 y it provides about 14 of continental freshwater input to the arctic ocean the lena river affects large areas of the laptev sea the brackish water surface plume propagates 350 km northward from its delta boucsein and stein 2000 the freshwater input has an important impact on abiotic and biotic parameters of the shelf waters during the winter in the laptev sea a wide zone up to 600 km of the fast ice is formed the fast ice extension and break up are closely linked with the lena river runoff selyuzhenok et al 2015 the river water contributes to arctic shelf ecosystem production it transports an important volume of heat magritsky 2009 nutrients and organic matter used by phytoplankton and bacteria sorokin and sorokin 1996 the sediment transport of the lena river is the highest among all rivers on the eurasian shelf and the third in the whole arctic basin holmes et al 2002 the lena river heat and solid matter load directly depends on the water discharge magritsky 2009 holmes et al 2002 recent changes in the arctic climate system and environment such as increases in temperature and precipitation permafrost melt and treeline advance white et al 2007 have resulted in an increase of freshwater river input to the arctic ocean peterson et al 2002 over the period 1936 2007 the general increase of river discharge to the arctic ocean from eurasia was observed with a rate of annual change of 2 7 0 5 km3 year shiklomanov 2010 the lena river contribution is 1 1 km3 year climate projections predict an increase in river water input from the whole siberian coast bring et al 2017 for the lena river basin this predicted increase is in the region of 25 50 100 years it will result in significant hydrological and ecological changes on the shelf of the laptev sea and likely in other basins of the arctic ocean through modified freshwater pathways morison et al 2012 in situ observations of water discharge in the low reaches of the lena river started in 1939 the modern tendencies of decline in observations in the arctic drainage basin lammers et al 2001 and of delay of data public delivery lachance cloutier et al 2017 are also observed in the case of the lena river the in situ records on water discharge at terminal station kusur are available only until 2011 this situation highlights the importance of the development of alternative methods for discharge estimation during the last two decades significant progress has been made in satellite methods of river flow quantification there are two main approaches used by researchers the first approach relies on the establishment of rating curves between in situ observations on the nearest gauge station and remotely sensed parameters an altimetric water height kouraev et al 2004 birkinshaw et al 2014 tarpanelli et al 2011 or an optical river width bjerklie et al 2005 pavelsky 2014 smith and pavelsky 2008 the second more advanced approach uses hydraulic equations and their parameters width slope depth estimated from satellites lefavour and alsdorf 2005 gleason et al 2014 many of these studies were dedicated to large tropical or temporal zone rivers for example the amazon ganga brahmaputra niger po and tiber rivers lefavour and alsdorf 2005 dubey et al 2015 papa et al 2012 tourian et al 2013 tarpanelli et al 2011 the number of studies employing the satellites for discharge estimation for arctic rivers is rather limited kouraev et al 2004 smith and pavelsky 2008 birkinshaw et al 2014 tourian et al 2013 sichangi et al 2016 in the arctic for methods using optical sensors the main limitation is cloud cover during spring when the highest water volume flows for altimetry based methods the presence of ice and low accuracy of the water level retrievals during the winter are reported as a main drawback tourian et al 2013 sichangi et al 2016 an inadequacy in the spatio temporal sampling of altimeters also constrains the application of remote sensing methods in the arctic polar orbit altimeters ers envisat saral altika and cryosat 2 have a poor temporal resolution 35 and 369 days and topex jason series altimeters with a 10 day repeat cycle provide measurements only up to 66 7 n which is far away from the mouths of most arctic rivers although in tourian et al 2013 and birkinshaw et al 2014 it was shown that sub monthly satellite measurements could be used for discharge estimation of the arctic ob river it is rather an exception which is explained by the ob river water regime large areas of the ob river watershed are occupied by bogs and the floodplain has a width up to 10 times the channel width it results in a high natural regulation capacity of the watershed the spring flood is slow and long 1 5 2 months and the autumn floods are strongly attenuated and can be captured by polar orbit satellites with sub monthly measurements the flood duration of other arctic rivers is much shorter and thus poorly sampled by polar orbiting altimeters the summer autumn floods are usually more pronounced and are quite short 1 2 weeks they are often missed in the altimetric water level time series that is the case for the lena river which is characterised by a less regular water regime and by rapid responses of the water level on rainfall the sampling frequency of the topex jason series altimeters could be enough to capture the main water regime events of the lena river but the northernmost topex jason virtual stations intersection of the river channel and satellite tracks are located 616 km from the terminal gauging station smith and pavelsky 2008 showed that information on water travelling time could be successfully used for a simple propagation of the river discharge to the downreaches of the lena river when estimating the water flow from modis width discharge rating curves adapting their practice for discharge propagation we demonstrate in this study that non polar orbiting altimetric satellites could be used for evaluation of the freshwater input into the arctic ocean for multi flood water regime rivers we evaluate the accuracy of the single track approach and then demonstrate an advantage of the track combination multi track approach 2 geographical and hydrological settings the lena river is located in central siberia it originates on the western slopes of mountains bordering lake baikal from the west and flows into the arctic ocean through the laptev sea its main tributaries drain the large area of aldan uplift the climate in the region is strongly continental the mean annual temperature is 10 c for eight months of the year from october until may the watershed is covered by snow the mean annual atmospheric precipitation ranges from 700 to 800 mm in upper reaches orographic effect to less than 250 mm in the middle and lower reaches the basin lies in the permafrost zone in the upper reaches the permafrost is relatively warm temperature of the frozen soils is close to 0 c and is undergoing a rapid degradation because of modern climate change the lena river drains an area of 2 430 000 km2 the most part of flow volume is generated in the upper and middle reaches 1310 km from the delta the lena river receives water from its biggest tributary the aldan river and 1100 km the viluy river later provides the last big water input fig 1 the total drainage area of the lena river after confluence with the viluy is 2 045 000 km2 which represents 84 of the total area gauged at the terminal kusur station mean annual flow of the lena river for 1980 2010 at the kusur station is 556 km3 the last main tributaries the aldan at verkhoyansky perevoz and the viluy at hatyrik homo constitute 174 and 56 km3 respectively per year the lena river at tabaga station before aldan inflow provides 241 km3 of water thus the lateral ungauged input of water from other small rivers in the lower lena reaches is about 85 km3 the water regime is characterised by high and rapid spring flood following snowmelt summer rain floods july august have smaller magnitude and are related either to the advection of pacific air moisture in the upper reaches or to the penetration of arctic lows into the continental part a significant part of the runoff generating basin is covered by mountainous terrains moreover permafrost is developed throughout the whole basin due to these features the regulation capacity of the soils is low the river response to the excess of water snowmelt or rain is rapid as compared to other large arctic rivers like the mackenzie or the ob the spring flood on the lena river lasts only 1 month middle of may middle of june and the summer floods have a duration of 1 2 weeks from the end of october to the middle of may the river is covered by ice on the north the river ice thickness can reach 2 m the flood starts from the south and propagates toward the north the flood wave often generates ice jams the ice jams result in a backwater effect and rapid rise of the water level but not of the discharge the ice jams at the location of big settlements last for several days but their duration in ungauged reaches as well as their impact on propagation of the flood wave are unknown 3 data and methods 3 1 data observations from jason 2 and jason 3 altimetric and landsat 8 optical satellite missions were used to produce the water level time series for the middle reach of the lena river the retrieved altimetric data were then combined with in situ observations provided by 5 gauging stations as the observational programs and the completeness of the in situ observations vary from station to station we had to create reconstructed water discharge time series for the middle lena r reach and for kusur station 3 1 1 altimetric data the jason 2 and its successor jason 3 radar altimeter satellites operate with a 10 days repeat orbit with an inclination of 66 038 it means that the northernmost track crosses the lena river at 66 038 n 616 km from the terminal station kusur the jason 2 operated during 2008 2016 in february 2016 jason 3 was launched in order to ensure continuity of the measurements missions flew in tandem with 80 s difference for 8 months the calibration period was not taken into account in this study nevertheless an intercomparison of the water level retrievals from jason 2 and jason 3 for three selected tracks gave very good results with 0 12 0 15 and 0 32 cm bias the 20 hz altimetric range retrievals were used along with corresponding geophysical corrections provided by the aviso data portal 3 1 2 water level and water discharge in situ data throughout its 4400 km length the lena river has 11 gauge stations operated by the russian hydrological survey where both the water level h and the discharges q are measured eight of them are situated in upper reaches two in middle reaches and only one in the lower reaches the water level is measured daily while the discharge is measured several times per year during the main phases of the water regime these discharge measurements are used for verification and adjustment of the rating curves for each given year the daily discharges are calculated by the hydrological survey from these readjusted curves the data from four gauge stations with both daily h and q data were used in this study two of them are situated on the lena river tabaga station in the middle reach and kusur station in the low reach two others are situated on the largest tributaries verhoyansky perevoz on the aldan river and hatyrik homo on the viluy river fig 1 one additional station gigansk providing only daily water level measurements was used in this work for ground trusting the altimetric water level retrievals on virtual stations the available in situ datasets and period covered by these data are presented in table 1 3 1 3 landsat images and water mask as demonstrated in previous studies kouraev et al 2004 zakharova et al 2006 dubey et al 2015 the precise geographical selection of the altimetric measurements significantly improves the quality of the water level retrievals the water mask for selection of altimetric measurements was produced from the several l1 landsat 8 images provided by the usgs data portal the use of the landsat 8 images from the end of july to september allowed the detection of islands and sand banks and thus the minimisation of islands and floodplain pollution of radar signals during low flow period the water mask was produced using a modified ndwi or mndwi index that showed good performance for the delineation of water bodies of different size and type in the studied region zakharova et al 2017 1 mndwi green swir1 green swir1 where green green band 0 53 0 58 µm swir1 short wave infrared band 1 57 1 65 µm during this previous study we investigated the performance of three widely used indexes ndvi ndwi and mndwi to detect water bodies we found that for our region mndwi produces the best contrast between the water and land surface and defined a threshold values for the present study we adopted the same threshold value and the pixels with mndwi 0 were classified as a water the sensitivity analysis also done in the previous study showed that the errors of the water extent detection by this approach from a 1 threshold change was 1 7 to produce our static mask we selected cloud and haze free images it allowed avoiding potential errors introduced by cloud shadows another potential source of false detection using mndwi is orographic shadow as the studied river reach has a wide flood plain we were not confronted with this problem in zakharova et al 2017 an elaborated mask was used for retrieval of the jason 2 and envisat water level for thermokarst lakes the size of certain lakes with successful retrievals was as low as 1 1 5 km2 it proves that our masks are accurate enough for altimetric tasks 3 2 methods 3 2 1 water level retrievals the high radar sampling rate 20 hz and signal processing algorithm allow us to obtain along track measurements of the surface height every 370 m the water level was calculated as the range with the corresponding geophysical corrections these corrections include wet and dry atmospheric corrections ionospheric correction polar and solid earth tides geoid correction the jason 2 and jason 3 geophysical data records gdr provide the range retrieved by two retrackers ocean and ice 1 because of saturation of the radar waveforms over the specular river surfaces the ocean retracker is not capable to retrieve the range over the lena river channel during the summer therefore the range retrieved by ice 1 algorithm is used in this study for the selection of appropriate radar measurements the landsat water mask was applied and next all selected measurements from a given day of satellite overpass for a given virtual station were averaged to obtain the altimetric water height this protocol was applied to 16 northernmost jason tracks located between 64 8 n and 66 13 n 3 2 2 rating curve construction the algorithm of the daily discharge evaluation based on the water level discharge relationship is the commonly used approach in hydrological practice iso 1998 wmo 1980 the theoretical base for this approach is described in many manuals rantz 1982 bykov 1965 in the ideal case linear mono branch reach absence of islands and seasonal vegetation or ice narrow floodplain etc the relation is uniform and is approximated by a power law 2 q a h b c where a b and c are specific coefficients for each reach in reality the relation between q and h is not uniform but rather varies with time because of changes in hydraulic conditions of the control river section for example the processes of erosion sediment deposition can alter the shape of the channels the inundation of the floodplains also results in the changes of the roughness conditions and water velocity additionally ice cover decreases the hydraulic radii and increases the roughness the best monotonous relations are obtained for linear mono branch reaches with the flow close to the steady state during the flood the flow becomes unsteady and all elements defining the discharge water depth wet perimeter velocity slope change with time the rating curve rc at high water level can show the loop with rising limb and recession limb this phenomenon often occurs for large rivers with low hydraulic slope bykov 1965 for the arctic rivers the water level rise in spring starts when ice cover is still present due to high hydraulic resistance of the channel in these conditions the rise branch usually lies below the recession branch on the q h plots it means that for the same water level the discharge is lower during the flood rise than during the flood recession in winter under the ice conditions the same discharges are observed at the higher water level the series of transitional coefficients qwinter qrecession or the specific winter rating curve both derived from measured winter discharges are usually applied for daily discharge estimations the described approach multi functional relation between h and q is a baseline used by the russian hydrological survey for estimation of the daily discharges previously this approach already showed improvement in water flow estimates when applying for altimetric water level measurements kouraev et al 2004 zakharova et al 2006 a simplified version was adopted in this study the main steps of rating curve construction included 1 separation of the observation period onto different hydrological phases spring flood rise general spring flood recession summer flood rise ice period transitional ice water period 2 analysis of the clouds of points of each phase on interannual variability 3 fitting the data for each water rise recession and winter ice phases the procedure was applied for each pair of virtual gauge station separately the transitional period between open water and ice in autumn was excluded from the analysis because of complex non functional q h relation it seems that the daily in situ q for this period were elaborated using series of transitional coefficients varying with time bykov 1965 unfortunately we did not have enough information to evaluate these coefficients the dates of open water ice cover were determined for each virtual station using information on temporal variability of the backscatter coefficient provided in the gdr the first ice significantly calms the water and produces strong altimetric return signal it corresponds to the last annual peak of the backscatter coefficient on temporal plots it was interpreted as a beginning of transitional period starting from this date the backscatter rapidly decreases when the ice reaches several centimetres in thickness and is covered by snow the decrease of backscatter slows down these dates are considered as the beginning of winter real ice conditions and the end of the transitional period 3 2 3 reconstruction of in situ discharge 3 2 3 1 middle lena river reach discharge the jason 2 3 satellites northernmost track passes 616 km south from the terminal gauging station kusur moreover the morphology of river valley is quite different between the lower and the middle reaches at these conditions an establishing of the reliable functional relation between altimetric h and in situ q at kusur seems to be problematic to overcame this problem we introduced an intermediate jason reach discharge qjason referred to middle reach of the lena river and the northernmost satellite tracks the estimation of the qjason was made using in situ data from the upperstream gauge stations on the lena river tabaga and its biggest influents the aldan river at verhoyansky perevoz station and the viluy river at hatyrik homo station following barbetta et al 2012 we used an assumption that the water discharge at a given river reach is functionally related to the water height at quite large 100 200 km part of the reach with the similar characteristics it means that the synthetic qjason can be a good proxy of the in situ discharge for entire 200 km section of the lena river reach overpassed by the 16 northernmost jason tracks at the same time the coefficients of the h q relations can slightly vary because of the variability of the local hydraulic conditions at each virtual station in order to take into account this variability the rating curves were developed for each virtual station to reduce ambiguity related to large distance between virtual and gauge stations a time lag correction was applied for qjason estimations where it was necessary this correction was also used for investigation of the relation between qjason and qin situ at kusur station using observations of the daily in situ water level on tabaga gigansk and kusur stations for a long period 1990 2011 the relevant corresponding hydrological events rain floods were detected and the records of the dates of corresponding peaks were kept the time lag was calculated as the difference of the dates between the stations for each set of corresponding events this time lag was then converted to the flood wave travelling time using the distance between the stations only summer rain floods were considered for estimation of the time lag the spring flood date records were rejected as the propagation of the spring flood wave is strongly affected by ice jams and significantly varies from year to year and from reach to reach according to our estimates the mean wave travelling speed in the middle and the low lena is of 110 29 km day 3 2 3 2 discharge at the terminal station kusur the in situ discharge for terminal station kusur is available only for 2008 2011 years while the in situ water level measurements cover the entire study period we used in situ daily water level and discharge to construct the station rating curves for 2008 2011 fig 2 using the method described in section 3 2 2 this relation has three distinct branches which represent different hydrological phases using this multiple relationship the daily discharge at the terminal station was reconstructed for the missing 2012 2016 years the accuracy of the reconstruction estimated as normalised rmse between reconstructed and in situ discharge for a 2008 2011 depends on hydrological phase the lowest accuracy 25 or 774 m3 s is obtained for winter period it is obviously related to interannual variability of ice conditions ice ridging during freezing for flood rise and for summer recession rain floods the accuracy is very high and equal to 4 and 6 respectively it corresponds to discharges of 3230 and 1090 m3 s comparison between reconstructed and in situ observations for 2008 2011 is presented on fig 2b 3 2 4 estimation of altimetric water discharge and monthly annual water flow 3 2 4 1 middle lena river reach altimetric discharge for each selected virtual station see section 4 1 the discharge at the date of satellite overflight qalti was estimated from the altimetric water level halti using a corresponding set of the rating curves developed from synthetic jason reach discharge qjason and halti for calibration period 2008 2010 see section 3 2 3 this produced altimetric discharge datasets qalti with the 10 days observational period before application of the eq 2 all halti were separated on three groups according to hydrological phases flood rise recession ice period for calculation of the monthly and annual river flow w from the 10 days altimetric observations qalti were linearly interpolated five daily discharge datasets were finally elaborated three datasets correspond to three jason 2 3 virtual stations and two were obtained by different combination of these discharges a fourth dataset is produced by joining of the qalti from three virtual stations this procedure resulted in three fold increase of the sampling frequency further linear interpolation between joint observations produced daily discharges called qjoint the fifth dataset represents virtual stations mean average of the already interpolated daily discharges qmean introduction of the two synthetic datasets allowed an evaluation of potential improvement from the combination of the tracks multi track approach as well as demonstrating an effect of the choice of the combination approach the monthly and annual water flow were estimated for each dataset from interpolated discharges 3 2 4 2 lower lena river reach altimetric discharge according to moramarco et al 2005 the downstream and upstream discharges are related as 3 q dn t q up t tm q l q where qdn t is discharge on downstream station at time t qup t tm discharge at upperstream station at earlier time equal to wave travelling time tm ql discharge from the lateral inflow and q discharge attenuation the discharge from the lateral inflow could be estimated as runoff from lateral area multiplied on interstation area according to our estimates the value of lateral runoff in the lower reaches of the lena river is closer to the runoff of the western small tributaries of the laptev sea the anabar and the olenek rivers and to the basin average than to the runoff of the northernmost tributary viluy river in this case the eq 3 transforms to linear function with an intercept equal to attenuation term and a simple statistical relation between qkusur t and qalti t tm could be established 3 2 5 validation approach all data from the study period from 2008 to 2016 were divided into two subsets a calibration subset 2008 2010 served for investigation of relations between altimetric water height and discharge at virtual stations and construction of the rating curves the in situ data on terminal station from 2011 were used for validation of results to enlarge the validation period we reconstructed in situ discharges at kusur station for 2012 2016 using in situ observations on water level and a set of rating curves see section 3 2 3 kusur station rating curves were elaborated according to the procedure described earlier from simultaneously available in situ daily h and q from 2008 to 2010 the accuracy of altimetric discharge and monthly and annual flow estimations were evaluated using bias root mean square error rmse normalised root mean square error nrmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient ns the general approach of discharge estimation at terminal station from satellite water height measurements at the middle reach is described in the following steps fig 3 1 retrieval of the water height from altimetric observations in the middle reaches of the lena river 2 selection of the virtual stations for discharge estimation 3 construction of the rating curves between the altimetric height and the proxy of the middle reaches in situ discharge qjason 4 evaluation of the discharge for selected virtual stations for each altimeter overpass and interpolation between these observations for estimation of the daily discharges 5 routing of the estimated middle reach daily discharge to the terminal station kusur 6 validation of the routed discharge against the discharge reconstructed from the in situ h observations at the kusur gauge 4 results 4 1 altimetric water level time series water level time series were retrieved for 16 northernmost tracks of jason 2 and jason 3 satellites crossing the lena river between 64 8 n and 66 13 n the river has a very complex morphology the reach is characterised by significant braiding and numerous sand banks appear over the water table in july august the total river width varies from 10 to 18 km but the width of the main channel is of 3 4 km the floodplain is quite large 5 15 km and surrounding terraces form the cliffs up to 50 m high because of this complex morphology the water level time series for the most part of the virtual stations contain many outliers an analysis of these outliers showed that in spite of the application of the water mask they characterise the elevation of the terraces or islands the removal of these outliers produced many gaps in the time series especially during the flood when an important part of annual flow passes fig 4 the main criteria for selection of the time series were their length and the minimum of the gaps during spring flood additional criterion was the similarity of the water regime at the virtual station to that of gigansk gauge station located in 93 km from the northernmost jason track table 2 the similarity was evaluated based on correlation and the rmse value between halt and hgigansk before calculation of correlation and rmse all altimetric time series were corrected on geoid difference with gigansk and water travelling time seven time series with less than 10 of the gaps in observations could be used potentially for discharge retrievals correlation between water level at these stations and gigansk gauges is sufficiently good and varies from 0 74 to 0 85 only three virtual stations compactly located in one reach within 55 km and having at least 10 altimetric observations for flood rise during calibration period were kept they correspond to the tracks from south to north 134 233 and 81 the distance between virtual stations 81 and 233 is 35 km and between 233 and 134 is 20 km no specific morphology of the channel or river valley that could help to explain the success of the retrievals and low quantity of the gaps in the time series was noted for these virtual stations comparison of the altimetric water height on the selected virtual stations with the water level observations on gigansk station fig 5 demonstrates that the altimetric retrievals catch well all main hydrological events spring and rain floods winter low flow at the same time there is a clear disagreement in the magnitude of the water level variation during the flood explained by varying channel geometry width numbers of branches islands etc as between gauge and virtual stations as between virtual stations themselves although the winter low flow is very well seen in the time series the quality of the winter retrievals is different for different virtual stations it also can deteriorate in some years for example 2012 2013 and 2014 except for several years the altimetric winter level does not show the winter recession moreover starting from march april e g 1 2 month before flood the altimetric water level slowly rises this behaviour is difficult to explain without detailed analysis of the spatio temporal evolution of the altimetric signal waveform over river ice but we found that this behaviour is quite common for the arctic environment as for rivers as for lakes the similar altimetric water level rise in pre flood period was found with envisat altimeter when using the same ice1 retracker as the ice2 retracker of envisat provides at the same moment the winter heights of 1 2 m lower we suggest that the pre flood water level overestimation comes from the retracking and the retrieval of altimetric height with an algorithm other than ice1 could resolve this problem 4 2 altimetric water discharge time series 4 2 1 rating curves as the seasonal magnitude of the water level is different for virtual stations the rating curves were established for each of them fig 6 for this the water discharge estimated from upperstream gauge stations qjason was used as a proxy of the in situ discharge at the middle reach see section 3 2 3 the rating curves were approximated by eq 3 the recession and winter curves are quite similar for all three stations the flood rising curves significantly differ at all three stations reflecting specific river morphology the accuracy of approximation was evaluated by nrmse and r2 statistics table 3 the accuracy of the fit is higher for rating curves of the two northern stations 81 and 233 for flood the nrmse is 18 and 9 for stations 81 and 233 respectively nrmse increases to 24 for station 134 for the recession curve the nrmse is 14 15 and 21 correspondingly although the jason 2 3 winter water level agrees on average with in situ observations it does not show the winter recession and in some years demonstrates the inverse temporal behaviour moderate increase by the end of winter the fit of the winter points is not robust and the nrmse for the winter discharge estimations is as high as 30 for all stations nevertheless the use of these equations produces quite realistic winter discharge 4 2 2 middle downreache simplified discharge propagation the daily altimetric discharges at the virtual stations were next recalculated to the terminal station kusur between the virtual stations and the terminal station the lena river receives an additional 16 of water from small ungauged tributaries during low or intermediate flow the relation between downstream and upperstream discharges is linear when taking into consideration the water travelling time taking the wave propagation speed see section 3 2 3 this travelling time is estimated to be 5 5 days at high discharges the relation shifts upward forming several loops fig 7 this shift varies from year to year depending on interannual variability of the ice and spring flood conditions no simple way to account for this interannual variation was found the power function close to linear which better accounts for the high values produced the best fit with lowest rmse 3455 m3 s or 17 and the r2 equals to 0 97 the final discharge referred to the terminal station calculated using this function is presented in fig 8 4 2 3 altimetric monthly and annual water flow variability the final results demonstrate that the altimetric satellites on non polar orbit of jason series capture very well the main variability of the lena river flow at its outlet for example interannual changes of summer water flow such as wet summers of 2008 2013 and 2016 as well as very dry summer of 2015 are well seen by the altimetric retrievals the inaccurate fit of the winter h q relations does not introduce significant errors into the annual flow estimates as the winter q variability is low comparing to other part of year for two years 2009 and 2016 the flood peaks are strongly underestimated as none of the three virtual stations provided valid altimetric water level measurements during this time despite the noted problems the interannual variability of the lena river annual water input to the arctic ocean is coherent with in situ observations even for the years of high underestimation of the spring discharge peak to increase the frequency of the altimetric observations the daily water discharges from three virtual stations were combined in one dataset it produced the multy tracks time series of qjoint with the data at the 1st 3rd and 7th days of each 10 day interval the further interpolation and estimation of the monthly and annual water flow from interpolated qjoint showed a significant gain from this procedure we also produced a dataset of mean daily altimetric discharges qmean obtained after averaging of the interpolated ten day qalti of each station this simple procedure also gave significant improvement in the representation of the monthly fig 9 and annual fig 10 river flow 5 discussion among the three virtual stations the flow estimated at virtual station 233 is the closest to the in situ observations fig 11 station 81 provides overestimated monthly and annual flow while the flow at station 134 is underestimated the averaging of interpolated daily discharges from the three stations in this case compensates for these errors the same effect is obtained by combining of the ten day observations from three virtual stations into one regarding the seasonal distribution of the errors the highest relative deviation of the water flow is observed in april and in november the months of ice water and water ice transition fig 12 it is related as with non accurate retrieval of water height from satellite measurements especially in april as with less accurate estimation of the discharge from the rating curve especially in november for these two months the altimetric water flow is overestimated on average by 50 60 exceptionally high overestimation of the monthly flow 150 was observed in 2012 2013 winter however in absolute values it represents only 4 17 km3 m and is much lower than the mean monthly flow of the lena river 53 km3 m although the altimetric peak discharges in general are lower than observed the proposed algorithm overestimates the flow during the flood month may by 15 30 this overestimation is compensated by winter and summer months when the altimetric monthly flow is 1 18 lower than the in situ one the altimetric estimates also reproduce very well the interannual variability of the lena river flow all altimetric datasets showed that the minimum of the annual flow occurred in 2011 and the maximum took place in 2012 and 2013 fig 10 evaluation of the accuracy of the discharge retrievals and monthly and annual water flow estimations is made for validation period 2011 2016 table 4 presents the validation scores for daily discharge monthly and annual water flow for each of the virtual stations and for two combined sets the highest nrmse of 50 60 is found for daily discharge estimations at the same time high nash sutcliffe coefficient 0 80 indicates the good fit of altimetric estimates to the observed data and proves that the altimetric discharge better describes the water regime than the multiannual averages for monthly flow the nrmse decreases down to 23 37 and the increase of ns coefficient demonstrates that the monthly altimetric estimates match the observations even better as the period of flow integration increases the nrmse decreases for annual flow it does not exceed 16 for individual virtual stations the decrease of nrmse along with the increase of integration time could indicate that important uncertainties were introduced by the simplified method of discharge rooting from upperstream to downstream reaches to do it we applied a 5 day shift and quasi linear relation between qjason and qkusur the relation works well until 60 000 m3 s but at higher discharges which correspond to spring flood there are several branches deviating from the main line see fig 7 when the flood wave propagates from south to north the ice having broken mechanically by this wave forms numerous obstacles the lena river is one of the arctic rivers known for its ice jams which are responsible for catastrophic inundation of settlements the ice state ice thickness ridging and the flood intensity differ from year to year it results in different propagation velocity of the flood wave and as consequence in several branches on qupperstream qdownstream plot for high discharges an amelioration appears for certain years when increasing the wave travelling time up to 7 8 days however it deteriorates the accuracy of the fitting of the lower discharges the combination of the discharge from three virtual stations as well as the simple three stations average of interpolated qalti significantly improve all the three parameters daily q monthly flow and annual flow the nash sutcliffe coefficient for the annual flow shows that the use of an individual virtual station is not efficient for estimation of the lena river freshwater input to the ocean as the coefficient is close to the 0 although we should note that the length of the validation period is not enough for correct evaluation of the ns coefficient and the absolute values should be taken with caution nevertheless we present the annual ns in order to demonstrate that any combination of the discharges from the individual virtual stations critically improves the efficiency of the annual flow estimation the next step to improve in future the accuracy of the arctic river flow evaluation is to use a multi satellite approach this approach already has a good potential for representation of the water level variations along the garonne river biancamaria et al 2017 po river tourian et al 2016 eight amazonian rivers schwatke et al 2015 it was also used for discharge estimation of the niger river tourian et al 2017 and other nine largest world rivers sichangi et al 2016 one of the promising approach for reconstruction of the water level time series from deriving orbit altimetric missions like cryosat 2 or saral altika starting from 2016 was demonstrated in villadsen et al 2015 the integration of the measurements from these missions along with the measurements from the recently launched sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b into jason 2 3 water level time series by relocation villadsen et al 2015 could significantly improve the accuracy of the water discharge retrievals for the lena river 6 conclusion polar orbit altimetric satellites with sub monthly observations are not suitable for estimating the discharge of arctic rivers which are characterised by rapid and high spring water rise non polar altimetric satellites of jason series with 10 day repeat cycle and orbit inclination of 66 038 do not cover by observations the lower reaches of the rivers nevertheless in this study we demonstrated on the lena river that jason 2 and jason 3 satellites can be successfully used for estimation of discharge as well as monthly and annual flow in arctic rivers the water level retrievals from three tracks located 650 km from the lena river terminal gauging station kusur were used for discharge estimation at the river outlet through a set of specific rating curves established for each virtual station these rating curves relate the altimetric water level and the discharge reconstructed from upperstream gauges on the main river and tributaries an additional simplified procedure of discharge transfer from the middle to lower reaches based on estimation of the water travelling time was applied the altimetric retrievals perform well in capturing all important hydrological phases including spring flood summer floods and winter low flow the errors associated with estimates evaluated as nrmse are high for daily discharges 51 63 and reduce with integration of discharge by time monthly flow errors are of 23 37 while annual flow errors vary between 9 and 16 in spite of large uncertainties in estimation of the daily discharge the high nash sutcliffe coefficient demonstrates that the prediction of daily discharge is more accurate than using historical mean from in situ observations the nash sutcliffe coefficient of altimetric annual flow is low for all three virtual stations an error reduction for annual flow values was observed when using multi station approach due to the complex river morphology braiding different width of channel and floodplain resulting in different annual water level magnitudes we did not directly merged the water level time series instead the multi station discharge datasets were obtained from altimetric discharges already calculated at each individual virtual station the multi station discharge merging reduced relative errors in the annual water flow estimates to 7 and significantly increased the nash sutcliffe coefficient to 0 46 the river ice does not impede application of the altimeters for estimation of river flow although the relative bias for winter altimetric height and water discharge are high the water contribution of the winter months to the annual flow is low moreover the use of specific winter rating curve reduces potential errors originated from inaccurate altimetric water height retrievals the jason 3 altimeter launched in 2016 succeed successfully the jason 2 and demonstrated low biases 0 12 0 15 and 0 32 cm of water level retrievals comparing with its predecessor therefore the developed algorithm and equations can be directly applied for the lena river freshwater input estimates in future since september 2017 the jason 3 operates over the rivers in dem digital elevation model mode this potentially could improve the water level retrieval accuracy biancamaria et al 2017 moreover the studied lena river reach is crossed by three sentinel 3 satellites tracks and the integration of their measurements into the merged discharge dataset will be also possible without additional efforts the demonstrated approach of the using non polar orbiting altimetric satellites for the estimation of river input into the arctic ocean could potentially be applied to a number of large 200 km3 y and middle size 25 km3 y eurasian rivers the exception to this are the middle sized rivers located on lena yenisey and lena kolyma interfluvial areas these rivers are not overflown by altimeters of jason series on the north american continent the jason satellites overpass the middle reaches of the mackenzie river lower reaches of yukon river as well as hudson bay rivers in kouraev et al 2004 it was shown that topex posedon altimeter jason 2 predecessor operated from 1992 to 2002 can provide an estimation of annual water flow in the arctic ob river with an accuracy of 1 3 which is comparable with that obtained in this study for jason 2 3 missions on the lena river if the accuracy of the topex poseidon water level retrievals on other arctic rivers is similar to the accuracy of the jason 2 it will give us an opportunity to construct a retrospective homogeneous record of the river water input to the arctic ocean for evaluating the hydro climatic changes acknowledgements this work was supported by the european space agency arcflux project of arctic itt we also express our gratitude towards dr v belikov institute of water problems russian academy of sciences for providing with valuable information on the lena river hydraulic specifics 
6817,due to the rapid decline of in situ observations on river discharge in arctic regions evaluation of the continental freshwater input to the arctic ocean has become problematic and necessitates the development of alternative approaches based on remote sensing radar altimetric satellites have demonstrated high potential for estimation of river water discharge compared to polar orbiting altimeters non polar orbit satellites have an advantage in temporal sampling their greatest drawback however is spatial coverage observations do not cover the low reaches of most parts of arctic rivers in this study of the lena river we demonstrate a way to overcome this limitation by using a combination of in situ observations from tributaries and satellite observations in the middle river reaches the water discharge as well as monthly and annual water flow were evaluated using three virtual stations direct combination of the water level from these virtual stations was not possible because of the difference in seasonal amplitude however the combination of altimetric discharge from the three independently processed tracks significantly improves the flow retrievals the accuracy of the monthly water flow estimates at the river outlet is 23 it increases with the integration time giving 7 for annual flow keywords radar altimetry jason2 3 freshwater input arctic rivers 1 introduction the lena river is the second largest by flow arctic river with water contribution of about 556 km3 y it provides about 14 of continental freshwater input to the arctic ocean the lena river affects large areas of the laptev sea the brackish water surface plume propagates 350 km northward from its delta boucsein and stein 2000 the freshwater input has an important impact on abiotic and biotic parameters of the shelf waters during the winter in the laptev sea a wide zone up to 600 km of the fast ice is formed the fast ice extension and break up are closely linked with the lena river runoff selyuzhenok et al 2015 the river water contributes to arctic shelf ecosystem production it transports an important volume of heat magritsky 2009 nutrients and organic matter used by phytoplankton and bacteria sorokin and sorokin 1996 the sediment transport of the lena river is the highest among all rivers on the eurasian shelf and the third in the whole arctic basin holmes et al 2002 the lena river heat and solid matter load directly depends on the water discharge magritsky 2009 holmes et al 2002 recent changes in the arctic climate system and environment such as increases in temperature and precipitation permafrost melt and treeline advance white et al 2007 have resulted in an increase of freshwater river input to the arctic ocean peterson et al 2002 over the period 1936 2007 the general increase of river discharge to the arctic ocean from eurasia was observed with a rate of annual change of 2 7 0 5 km3 year shiklomanov 2010 the lena river contribution is 1 1 km3 year climate projections predict an increase in river water input from the whole siberian coast bring et al 2017 for the lena river basin this predicted increase is in the region of 25 50 100 years it will result in significant hydrological and ecological changes on the shelf of the laptev sea and likely in other basins of the arctic ocean through modified freshwater pathways morison et al 2012 in situ observations of water discharge in the low reaches of the lena river started in 1939 the modern tendencies of decline in observations in the arctic drainage basin lammers et al 2001 and of delay of data public delivery lachance cloutier et al 2017 are also observed in the case of the lena river the in situ records on water discharge at terminal station kusur are available only until 2011 this situation highlights the importance of the development of alternative methods for discharge estimation during the last two decades significant progress has been made in satellite methods of river flow quantification there are two main approaches used by researchers the first approach relies on the establishment of rating curves between in situ observations on the nearest gauge station and remotely sensed parameters an altimetric water height kouraev et al 2004 birkinshaw et al 2014 tarpanelli et al 2011 or an optical river width bjerklie et al 2005 pavelsky 2014 smith and pavelsky 2008 the second more advanced approach uses hydraulic equations and their parameters width slope depth estimated from satellites lefavour and alsdorf 2005 gleason et al 2014 many of these studies were dedicated to large tropical or temporal zone rivers for example the amazon ganga brahmaputra niger po and tiber rivers lefavour and alsdorf 2005 dubey et al 2015 papa et al 2012 tourian et al 2013 tarpanelli et al 2011 the number of studies employing the satellites for discharge estimation for arctic rivers is rather limited kouraev et al 2004 smith and pavelsky 2008 birkinshaw et al 2014 tourian et al 2013 sichangi et al 2016 in the arctic for methods using optical sensors the main limitation is cloud cover during spring when the highest water volume flows for altimetry based methods the presence of ice and low accuracy of the water level retrievals during the winter are reported as a main drawback tourian et al 2013 sichangi et al 2016 an inadequacy in the spatio temporal sampling of altimeters also constrains the application of remote sensing methods in the arctic polar orbit altimeters ers envisat saral altika and cryosat 2 have a poor temporal resolution 35 and 369 days and topex jason series altimeters with a 10 day repeat cycle provide measurements only up to 66 7 n which is far away from the mouths of most arctic rivers although in tourian et al 2013 and birkinshaw et al 2014 it was shown that sub monthly satellite measurements could be used for discharge estimation of the arctic ob river it is rather an exception which is explained by the ob river water regime large areas of the ob river watershed are occupied by bogs and the floodplain has a width up to 10 times the channel width it results in a high natural regulation capacity of the watershed the spring flood is slow and long 1 5 2 months and the autumn floods are strongly attenuated and can be captured by polar orbit satellites with sub monthly measurements the flood duration of other arctic rivers is much shorter and thus poorly sampled by polar orbiting altimeters the summer autumn floods are usually more pronounced and are quite short 1 2 weeks they are often missed in the altimetric water level time series that is the case for the lena river which is characterised by a less regular water regime and by rapid responses of the water level on rainfall the sampling frequency of the topex jason series altimeters could be enough to capture the main water regime events of the lena river but the northernmost topex jason virtual stations intersection of the river channel and satellite tracks are located 616 km from the terminal gauging station smith and pavelsky 2008 showed that information on water travelling time could be successfully used for a simple propagation of the river discharge to the downreaches of the lena river when estimating the water flow from modis width discharge rating curves adapting their practice for discharge propagation we demonstrate in this study that non polar orbiting altimetric satellites could be used for evaluation of the freshwater input into the arctic ocean for multi flood water regime rivers we evaluate the accuracy of the single track approach and then demonstrate an advantage of the track combination multi track approach 2 geographical and hydrological settings the lena river is located in central siberia it originates on the western slopes of mountains bordering lake baikal from the west and flows into the arctic ocean through the laptev sea its main tributaries drain the large area of aldan uplift the climate in the region is strongly continental the mean annual temperature is 10 c for eight months of the year from october until may the watershed is covered by snow the mean annual atmospheric precipitation ranges from 700 to 800 mm in upper reaches orographic effect to less than 250 mm in the middle and lower reaches the basin lies in the permafrost zone in the upper reaches the permafrost is relatively warm temperature of the frozen soils is close to 0 c and is undergoing a rapid degradation because of modern climate change the lena river drains an area of 2 430 000 km2 the most part of flow volume is generated in the upper and middle reaches 1310 km from the delta the lena river receives water from its biggest tributary the aldan river and 1100 km the viluy river later provides the last big water input fig 1 the total drainage area of the lena river after confluence with the viluy is 2 045 000 km2 which represents 84 of the total area gauged at the terminal kusur station mean annual flow of the lena river for 1980 2010 at the kusur station is 556 km3 the last main tributaries the aldan at verkhoyansky perevoz and the viluy at hatyrik homo constitute 174 and 56 km3 respectively per year the lena river at tabaga station before aldan inflow provides 241 km3 of water thus the lateral ungauged input of water from other small rivers in the lower lena reaches is about 85 km3 the water regime is characterised by high and rapid spring flood following snowmelt summer rain floods july august have smaller magnitude and are related either to the advection of pacific air moisture in the upper reaches or to the penetration of arctic lows into the continental part a significant part of the runoff generating basin is covered by mountainous terrains moreover permafrost is developed throughout the whole basin due to these features the regulation capacity of the soils is low the river response to the excess of water snowmelt or rain is rapid as compared to other large arctic rivers like the mackenzie or the ob the spring flood on the lena river lasts only 1 month middle of may middle of june and the summer floods have a duration of 1 2 weeks from the end of october to the middle of may the river is covered by ice on the north the river ice thickness can reach 2 m the flood starts from the south and propagates toward the north the flood wave often generates ice jams the ice jams result in a backwater effect and rapid rise of the water level but not of the discharge the ice jams at the location of big settlements last for several days but their duration in ungauged reaches as well as their impact on propagation of the flood wave are unknown 3 data and methods 3 1 data observations from jason 2 and jason 3 altimetric and landsat 8 optical satellite missions were used to produce the water level time series for the middle reach of the lena river the retrieved altimetric data were then combined with in situ observations provided by 5 gauging stations as the observational programs and the completeness of the in situ observations vary from station to station we had to create reconstructed water discharge time series for the middle lena r reach and for kusur station 3 1 1 altimetric data the jason 2 and its successor jason 3 radar altimeter satellites operate with a 10 days repeat orbit with an inclination of 66 038 it means that the northernmost track crosses the lena river at 66 038 n 616 km from the terminal station kusur the jason 2 operated during 2008 2016 in february 2016 jason 3 was launched in order to ensure continuity of the measurements missions flew in tandem with 80 s difference for 8 months the calibration period was not taken into account in this study nevertheless an intercomparison of the water level retrievals from jason 2 and jason 3 for three selected tracks gave very good results with 0 12 0 15 and 0 32 cm bias the 20 hz altimetric range retrievals were used along with corresponding geophysical corrections provided by the aviso data portal 3 1 2 water level and water discharge in situ data throughout its 4400 km length the lena river has 11 gauge stations operated by the russian hydrological survey where both the water level h and the discharges q are measured eight of them are situated in upper reaches two in middle reaches and only one in the lower reaches the water level is measured daily while the discharge is measured several times per year during the main phases of the water regime these discharge measurements are used for verification and adjustment of the rating curves for each given year the daily discharges are calculated by the hydrological survey from these readjusted curves the data from four gauge stations with both daily h and q data were used in this study two of them are situated on the lena river tabaga station in the middle reach and kusur station in the low reach two others are situated on the largest tributaries verhoyansky perevoz on the aldan river and hatyrik homo on the viluy river fig 1 one additional station gigansk providing only daily water level measurements was used in this work for ground trusting the altimetric water level retrievals on virtual stations the available in situ datasets and period covered by these data are presented in table 1 3 1 3 landsat images and water mask as demonstrated in previous studies kouraev et al 2004 zakharova et al 2006 dubey et al 2015 the precise geographical selection of the altimetric measurements significantly improves the quality of the water level retrievals the water mask for selection of altimetric measurements was produced from the several l1 landsat 8 images provided by the usgs data portal the use of the landsat 8 images from the end of july to september allowed the detection of islands and sand banks and thus the minimisation of islands and floodplain pollution of radar signals during low flow period the water mask was produced using a modified ndwi or mndwi index that showed good performance for the delineation of water bodies of different size and type in the studied region zakharova et al 2017 1 mndwi green swir1 green swir1 where green green band 0 53 0 58 µm swir1 short wave infrared band 1 57 1 65 µm during this previous study we investigated the performance of three widely used indexes ndvi ndwi and mndwi to detect water bodies we found that for our region mndwi produces the best contrast between the water and land surface and defined a threshold values for the present study we adopted the same threshold value and the pixels with mndwi 0 were classified as a water the sensitivity analysis also done in the previous study showed that the errors of the water extent detection by this approach from a 1 threshold change was 1 7 to produce our static mask we selected cloud and haze free images it allowed avoiding potential errors introduced by cloud shadows another potential source of false detection using mndwi is orographic shadow as the studied river reach has a wide flood plain we were not confronted with this problem in zakharova et al 2017 an elaborated mask was used for retrieval of the jason 2 and envisat water level for thermokarst lakes the size of certain lakes with successful retrievals was as low as 1 1 5 km2 it proves that our masks are accurate enough for altimetric tasks 3 2 methods 3 2 1 water level retrievals the high radar sampling rate 20 hz and signal processing algorithm allow us to obtain along track measurements of the surface height every 370 m the water level was calculated as the range with the corresponding geophysical corrections these corrections include wet and dry atmospheric corrections ionospheric correction polar and solid earth tides geoid correction the jason 2 and jason 3 geophysical data records gdr provide the range retrieved by two retrackers ocean and ice 1 because of saturation of the radar waveforms over the specular river surfaces the ocean retracker is not capable to retrieve the range over the lena river channel during the summer therefore the range retrieved by ice 1 algorithm is used in this study for the selection of appropriate radar measurements the landsat water mask was applied and next all selected measurements from a given day of satellite overpass for a given virtual station were averaged to obtain the altimetric water height this protocol was applied to 16 northernmost jason tracks located between 64 8 n and 66 13 n 3 2 2 rating curve construction the algorithm of the daily discharge evaluation based on the water level discharge relationship is the commonly used approach in hydrological practice iso 1998 wmo 1980 the theoretical base for this approach is described in many manuals rantz 1982 bykov 1965 in the ideal case linear mono branch reach absence of islands and seasonal vegetation or ice narrow floodplain etc the relation is uniform and is approximated by a power law 2 q a h b c where a b and c are specific coefficients for each reach in reality the relation between q and h is not uniform but rather varies with time because of changes in hydraulic conditions of the control river section for example the processes of erosion sediment deposition can alter the shape of the channels the inundation of the floodplains also results in the changes of the roughness conditions and water velocity additionally ice cover decreases the hydraulic radii and increases the roughness the best monotonous relations are obtained for linear mono branch reaches with the flow close to the steady state during the flood the flow becomes unsteady and all elements defining the discharge water depth wet perimeter velocity slope change with time the rating curve rc at high water level can show the loop with rising limb and recession limb this phenomenon often occurs for large rivers with low hydraulic slope bykov 1965 for the arctic rivers the water level rise in spring starts when ice cover is still present due to high hydraulic resistance of the channel in these conditions the rise branch usually lies below the recession branch on the q h plots it means that for the same water level the discharge is lower during the flood rise than during the flood recession in winter under the ice conditions the same discharges are observed at the higher water level the series of transitional coefficients qwinter qrecession or the specific winter rating curve both derived from measured winter discharges are usually applied for daily discharge estimations the described approach multi functional relation between h and q is a baseline used by the russian hydrological survey for estimation of the daily discharges previously this approach already showed improvement in water flow estimates when applying for altimetric water level measurements kouraev et al 2004 zakharova et al 2006 a simplified version was adopted in this study the main steps of rating curve construction included 1 separation of the observation period onto different hydrological phases spring flood rise general spring flood recession summer flood rise ice period transitional ice water period 2 analysis of the clouds of points of each phase on interannual variability 3 fitting the data for each water rise recession and winter ice phases the procedure was applied for each pair of virtual gauge station separately the transitional period between open water and ice in autumn was excluded from the analysis because of complex non functional q h relation it seems that the daily in situ q for this period were elaborated using series of transitional coefficients varying with time bykov 1965 unfortunately we did not have enough information to evaluate these coefficients the dates of open water ice cover were determined for each virtual station using information on temporal variability of the backscatter coefficient provided in the gdr the first ice significantly calms the water and produces strong altimetric return signal it corresponds to the last annual peak of the backscatter coefficient on temporal plots it was interpreted as a beginning of transitional period starting from this date the backscatter rapidly decreases when the ice reaches several centimetres in thickness and is covered by snow the decrease of backscatter slows down these dates are considered as the beginning of winter real ice conditions and the end of the transitional period 3 2 3 reconstruction of in situ discharge 3 2 3 1 middle lena river reach discharge the jason 2 3 satellites northernmost track passes 616 km south from the terminal gauging station kusur moreover the morphology of river valley is quite different between the lower and the middle reaches at these conditions an establishing of the reliable functional relation between altimetric h and in situ q at kusur seems to be problematic to overcame this problem we introduced an intermediate jason reach discharge qjason referred to middle reach of the lena river and the northernmost satellite tracks the estimation of the qjason was made using in situ data from the upperstream gauge stations on the lena river tabaga and its biggest influents the aldan river at verhoyansky perevoz station and the viluy river at hatyrik homo station following barbetta et al 2012 we used an assumption that the water discharge at a given river reach is functionally related to the water height at quite large 100 200 km part of the reach with the similar characteristics it means that the synthetic qjason can be a good proxy of the in situ discharge for entire 200 km section of the lena river reach overpassed by the 16 northernmost jason tracks at the same time the coefficients of the h q relations can slightly vary because of the variability of the local hydraulic conditions at each virtual station in order to take into account this variability the rating curves were developed for each virtual station to reduce ambiguity related to large distance between virtual and gauge stations a time lag correction was applied for qjason estimations where it was necessary this correction was also used for investigation of the relation between qjason and qin situ at kusur station using observations of the daily in situ water level on tabaga gigansk and kusur stations for a long period 1990 2011 the relevant corresponding hydrological events rain floods were detected and the records of the dates of corresponding peaks were kept the time lag was calculated as the difference of the dates between the stations for each set of corresponding events this time lag was then converted to the flood wave travelling time using the distance between the stations only summer rain floods were considered for estimation of the time lag the spring flood date records were rejected as the propagation of the spring flood wave is strongly affected by ice jams and significantly varies from year to year and from reach to reach according to our estimates the mean wave travelling speed in the middle and the low lena is of 110 29 km day 3 2 3 2 discharge at the terminal station kusur the in situ discharge for terminal station kusur is available only for 2008 2011 years while the in situ water level measurements cover the entire study period we used in situ daily water level and discharge to construct the station rating curves for 2008 2011 fig 2 using the method described in section 3 2 2 this relation has three distinct branches which represent different hydrological phases using this multiple relationship the daily discharge at the terminal station was reconstructed for the missing 2012 2016 years the accuracy of the reconstruction estimated as normalised rmse between reconstructed and in situ discharge for a 2008 2011 depends on hydrological phase the lowest accuracy 25 or 774 m3 s is obtained for winter period it is obviously related to interannual variability of ice conditions ice ridging during freezing for flood rise and for summer recession rain floods the accuracy is very high and equal to 4 and 6 respectively it corresponds to discharges of 3230 and 1090 m3 s comparison between reconstructed and in situ observations for 2008 2011 is presented on fig 2b 3 2 4 estimation of altimetric water discharge and monthly annual water flow 3 2 4 1 middle lena river reach altimetric discharge for each selected virtual station see section 4 1 the discharge at the date of satellite overflight qalti was estimated from the altimetric water level halti using a corresponding set of the rating curves developed from synthetic jason reach discharge qjason and halti for calibration period 2008 2010 see section 3 2 3 this produced altimetric discharge datasets qalti with the 10 days observational period before application of the eq 2 all halti were separated on three groups according to hydrological phases flood rise recession ice period for calculation of the monthly and annual river flow w from the 10 days altimetric observations qalti were linearly interpolated five daily discharge datasets were finally elaborated three datasets correspond to three jason 2 3 virtual stations and two were obtained by different combination of these discharges a fourth dataset is produced by joining of the qalti from three virtual stations this procedure resulted in three fold increase of the sampling frequency further linear interpolation between joint observations produced daily discharges called qjoint the fifth dataset represents virtual stations mean average of the already interpolated daily discharges qmean introduction of the two synthetic datasets allowed an evaluation of potential improvement from the combination of the tracks multi track approach as well as demonstrating an effect of the choice of the combination approach the monthly and annual water flow were estimated for each dataset from interpolated discharges 3 2 4 2 lower lena river reach altimetric discharge according to moramarco et al 2005 the downstream and upstream discharges are related as 3 q dn t q up t tm q l q where qdn t is discharge on downstream station at time t qup t tm discharge at upperstream station at earlier time equal to wave travelling time tm ql discharge from the lateral inflow and q discharge attenuation the discharge from the lateral inflow could be estimated as runoff from lateral area multiplied on interstation area according to our estimates the value of lateral runoff in the lower reaches of the lena river is closer to the runoff of the western small tributaries of the laptev sea the anabar and the olenek rivers and to the basin average than to the runoff of the northernmost tributary viluy river in this case the eq 3 transforms to linear function with an intercept equal to attenuation term and a simple statistical relation between qkusur t and qalti t tm could be established 3 2 5 validation approach all data from the study period from 2008 to 2016 were divided into two subsets a calibration subset 2008 2010 served for investigation of relations between altimetric water height and discharge at virtual stations and construction of the rating curves the in situ data on terminal station from 2011 were used for validation of results to enlarge the validation period we reconstructed in situ discharges at kusur station for 2012 2016 using in situ observations on water level and a set of rating curves see section 3 2 3 kusur station rating curves were elaborated according to the procedure described earlier from simultaneously available in situ daily h and q from 2008 to 2010 the accuracy of altimetric discharge and monthly and annual flow estimations were evaluated using bias root mean square error rmse normalised root mean square error nrmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient ns the general approach of discharge estimation at terminal station from satellite water height measurements at the middle reach is described in the following steps fig 3 1 retrieval of the water height from altimetric observations in the middle reaches of the lena river 2 selection of the virtual stations for discharge estimation 3 construction of the rating curves between the altimetric height and the proxy of the middle reaches in situ discharge qjason 4 evaluation of the discharge for selected virtual stations for each altimeter overpass and interpolation between these observations for estimation of the daily discharges 5 routing of the estimated middle reach daily discharge to the terminal station kusur 6 validation of the routed discharge against the discharge reconstructed from the in situ h observations at the kusur gauge 4 results 4 1 altimetric water level time series water level time series were retrieved for 16 northernmost tracks of jason 2 and jason 3 satellites crossing the lena river between 64 8 n and 66 13 n the river has a very complex morphology the reach is characterised by significant braiding and numerous sand banks appear over the water table in july august the total river width varies from 10 to 18 km but the width of the main channel is of 3 4 km the floodplain is quite large 5 15 km and surrounding terraces form the cliffs up to 50 m high because of this complex morphology the water level time series for the most part of the virtual stations contain many outliers an analysis of these outliers showed that in spite of the application of the water mask they characterise the elevation of the terraces or islands the removal of these outliers produced many gaps in the time series especially during the flood when an important part of annual flow passes fig 4 the main criteria for selection of the time series were their length and the minimum of the gaps during spring flood additional criterion was the similarity of the water regime at the virtual station to that of gigansk gauge station located in 93 km from the northernmost jason track table 2 the similarity was evaluated based on correlation and the rmse value between halt and hgigansk before calculation of correlation and rmse all altimetric time series were corrected on geoid difference with gigansk and water travelling time seven time series with less than 10 of the gaps in observations could be used potentially for discharge retrievals correlation between water level at these stations and gigansk gauges is sufficiently good and varies from 0 74 to 0 85 only three virtual stations compactly located in one reach within 55 km and having at least 10 altimetric observations for flood rise during calibration period were kept they correspond to the tracks from south to north 134 233 and 81 the distance between virtual stations 81 and 233 is 35 km and between 233 and 134 is 20 km no specific morphology of the channel or river valley that could help to explain the success of the retrievals and low quantity of the gaps in the time series was noted for these virtual stations comparison of the altimetric water height on the selected virtual stations with the water level observations on gigansk station fig 5 demonstrates that the altimetric retrievals catch well all main hydrological events spring and rain floods winter low flow at the same time there is a clear disagreement in the magnitude of the water level variation during the flood explained by varying channel geometry width numbers of branches islands etc as between gauge and virtual stations as between virtual stations themselves although the winter low flow is very well seen in the time series the quality of the winter retrievals is different for different virtual stations it also can deteriorate in some years for example 2012 2013 and 2014 except for several years the altimetric winter level does not show the winter recession moreover starting from march april e g 1 2 month before flood the altimetric water level slowly rises this behaviour is difficult to explain without detailed analysis of the spatio temporal evolution of the altimetric signal waveform over river ice but we found that this behaviour is quite common for the arctic environment as for rivers as for lakes the similar altimetric water level rise in pre flood period was found with envisat altimeter when using the same ice1 retracker as the ice2 retracker of envisat provides at the same moment the winter heights of 1 2 m lower we suggest that the pre flood water level overestimation comes from the retracking and the retrieval of altimetric height with an algorithm other than ice1 could resolve this problem 4 2 altimetric water discharge time series 4 2 1 rating curves as the seasonal magnitude of the water level is different for virtual stations the rating curves were established for each of them fig 6 for this the water discharge estimated from upperstream gauge stations qjason was used as a proxy of the in situ discharge at the middle reach see section 3 2 3 the rating curves were approximated by eq 3 the recession and winter curves are quite similar for all three stations the flood rising curves significantly differ at all three stations reflecting specific river morphology the accuracy of approximation was evaluated by nrmse and r2 statistics table 3 the accuracy of the fit is higher for rating curves of the two northern stations 81 and 233 for flood the nrmse is 18 and 9 for stations 81 and 233 respectively nrmse increases to 24 for station 134 for the recession curve the nrmse is 14 15 and 21 correspondingly although the jason 2 3 winter water level agrees on average with in situ observations it does not show the winter recession and in some years demonstrates the inverse temporal behaviour moderate increase by the end of winter the fit of the winter points is not robust and the nrmse for the winter discharge estimations is as high as 30 for all stations nevertheless the use of these equations produces quite realistic winter discharge 4 2 2 middle downreache simplified discharge propagation the daily altimetric discharges at the virtual stations were next recalculated to the terminal station kusur between the virtual stations and the terminal station the lena river receives an additional 16 of water from small ungauged tributaries during low or intermediate flow the relation between downstream and upperstream discharges is linear when taking into consideration the water travelling time taking the wave propagation speed see section 3 2 3 this travelling time is estimated to be 5 5 days at high discharges the relation shifts upward forming several loops fig 7 this shift varies from year to year depending on interannual variability of the ice and spring flood conditions no simple way to account for this interannual variation was found the power function close to linear which better accounts for the high values produced the best fit with lowest rmse 3455 m3 s or 17 and the r2 equals to 0 97 the final discharge referred to the terminal station calculated using this function is presented in fig 8 4 2 3 altimetric monthly and annual water flow variability the final results demonstrate that the altimetric satellites on non polar orbit of jason series capture very well the main variability of the lena river flow at its outlet for example interannual changes of summer water flow such as wet summers of 2008 2013 and 2016 as well as very dry summer of 2015 are well seen by the altimetric retrievals the inaccurate fit of the winter h q relations does not introduce significant errors into the annual flow estimates as the winter q variability is low comparing to other part of year for two years 2009 and 2016 the flood peaks are strongly underestimated as none of the three virtual stations provided valid altimetric water level measurements during this time despite the noted problems the interannual variability of the lena river annual water input to the arctic ocean is coherent with in situ observations even for the years of high underestimation of the spring discharge peak to increase the frequency of the altimetric observations the daily water discharges from three virtual stations were combined in one dataset it produced the multy tracks time series of qjoint with the data at the 1st 3rd and 7th days of each 10 day interval the further interpolation and estimation of the monthly and annual water flow from interpolated qjoint showed a significant gain from this procedure we also produced a dataset of mean daily altimetric discharges qmean obtained after averaging of the interpolated ten day qalti of each station this simple procedure also gave significant improvement in the representation of the monthly fig 9 and annual fig 10 river flow 5 discussion among the three virtual stations the flow estimated at virtual station 233 is the closest to the in situ observations fig 11 station 81 provides overestimated monthly and annual flow while the flow at station 134 is underestimated the averaging of interpolated daily discharges from the three stations in this case compensates for these errors the same effect is obtained by combining of the ten day observations from three virtual stations into one regarding the seasonal distribution of the errors the highest relative deviation of the water flow is observed in april and in november the months of ice water and water ice transition fig 12 it is related as with non accurate retrieval of water height from satellite measurements especially in april as with less accurate estimation of the discharge from the rating curve especially in november for these two months the altimetric water flow is overestimated on average by 50 60 exceptionally high overestimation of the monthly flow 150 was observed in 2012 2013 winter however in absolute values it represents only 4 17 km3 m and is much lower than the mean monthly flow of the lena river 53 km3 m although the altimetric peak discharges in general are lower than observed the proposed algorithm overestimates the flow during the flood month may by 15 30 this overestimation is compensated by winter and summer months when the altimetric monthly flow is 1 18 lower than the in situ one the altimetric estimates also reproduce very well the interannual variability of the lena river flow all altimetric datasets showed that the minimum of the annual flow occurred in 2011 and the maximum took place in 2012 and 2013 fig 10 evaluation of the accuracy of the discharge retrievals and monthly and annual water flow estimations is made for validation period 2011 2016 table 4 presents the validation scores for daily discharge monthly and annual water flow for each of the virtual stations and for two combined sets the highest nrmse of 50 60 is found for daily discharge estimations at the same time high nash sutcliffe coefficient 0 80 indicates the good fit of altimetric estimates to the observed data and proves that the altimetric discharge better describes the water regime than the multiannual averages for monthly flow the nrmse decreases down to 23 37 and the increase of ns coefficient demonstrates that the monthly altimetric estimates match the observations even better as the period of flow integration increases the nrmse decreases for annual flow it does not exceed 16 for individual virtual stations the decrease of nrmse along with the increase of integration time could indicate that important uncertainties were introduced by the simplified method of discharge rooting from upperstream to downstream reaches to do it we applied a 5 day shift and quasi linear relation between qjason and qkusur the relation works well until 60 000 m3 s but at higher discharges which correspond to spring flood there are several branches deviating from the main line see fig 7 when the flood wave propagates from south to north the ice having broken mechanically by this wave forms numerous obstacles the lena river is one of the arctic rivers known for its ice jams which are responsible for catastrophic inundation of settlements the ice state ice thickness ridging and the flood intensity differ from year to year it results in different propagation velocity of the flood wave and as consequence in several branches on qupperstream qdownstream plot for high discharges an amelioration appears for certain years when increasing the wave travelling time up to 7 8 days however it deteriorates the accuracy of the fitting of the lower discharges the combination of the discharge from three virtual stations as well as the simple three stations average of interpolated qalti significantly improve all the three parameters daily q monthly flow and annual flow the nash sutcliffe coefficient for the annual flow shows that the use of an individual virtual station is not efficient for estimation of the lena river freshwater input to the ocean as the coefficient is close to the 0 although we should note that the length of the validation period is not enough for correct evaluation of the ns coefficient and the absolute values should be taken with caution nevertheless we present the annual ns in order to demonstrate that any combination of the discharges from the individual virtual stations critically improves the efficiency of the annual flow estimation the next step to improve in future the accuracy of the arctic river flow evaluation is to use a multi satellite approach this approach already has a good potential for representation of the water level variations along the garonne river biancamaria et al 2017 po river tourian et al 2016 eight amazonian rivers schwatke et al 2015 it was also used for discharge estimation of the niger river tourian et al 2017 and other nine largest world rivers sichangi et al 2016 one of the promising approach for reconstruction of the water level time series from deriving orbit altimetric missions like cryosat 2 or saral altika starting from 2016 was demonstrated in villadsen et al 2015 the integration of the measurements from these missions along with the measurements from the recently launched sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b into jason 2 3 water level time series by relocation villadsen et al 2015 could significantly improve the accuracy of the water discharge retrievals for the lena river 6 conclusion polar orbit altimetric satellites with sub monthly observations are not suitable for estimating the discharge of arctic rivers which are characterised by rapid and high spring water rise non polar altimetric satellites of jason series with 10 day repeat cycle and orbit inclination of 66 038 do not cover by observations the lower reaches of the rivers nevertheless in this study we demonstrated on the lena river that jason 2 and jason 3 satellites can be successfully used for estimation of discharge as well as monthly and annual flow in arctic rivers the water level retrievals from three tracks located 650 km from the lena river terminal gauging station kusur were used for discharge estimation at the river outlet through a set of specific rating curves established for each virtual station these rating curves relate the altimetric water level and the discharge reconstructed from upperstream gauges on the main river and tributaries an additional simplified procedure of discharge transfer from the middle to lower reaches based on estimation of the water travelling time was applied the altimetric retrievals perform well in capturing all important hydrological phases including spring flood summer floods and winter low flow the errors associated with estimates evaluated as nrmse are high for daily discharges 51 63 and reduce with integration of discharge by time monthly flow errors are of 23 37 while annual flow errors vary between 9 and 16 in spite of large uncertainties in estimation of the daily discharge the high nash sutcliffe coefficient demonstrates that the prediction of daily discharge is more accurate than using historical mean from in situ observations the nash sutcliffe coefficient of altimetric annual flow is low for all three virtual stations an error reduction for annual flow values was observed when using multi station approach due to the complex river morphology braiding different width of channel and floodplain resulting in different annual water level magnitudes we did not directly merged the water level time series instead the multi station discharge datasets were obtained from altimetric discharges already calculated at each individual virtual station the multi station discharge merging reduced relative errors in the annual water flow estimates to 7 and significantly increased the nash sutcliffe coefficient to 0 46 the river ice does not impede application of the altimeters for estimation of river flow although the relative bias for winter altimetric height and water discharge are high the water contribution of the winter months to the annual flow is low moreover the use of specific winter rating curve reduces potential errors originated from inaccurate altimetric water height retrievals the jason 3 altimeter launched in 2016 succeed successfully the jason 2 and demonstrated low biases 0 12 0 15 and 0 32 cm of water level retrievals comparing with its predecessor therefore the developed algorithm and equations can be directly applied for the lena river freshwater input estimates in future since september 2017 the jason 3 operates over the rivers in dem digital elevation model mode this potentially could improve the water level retrieval accuracy biancamaria et al 2017 moreover the studied lena river reach is crossed by three sentinel 3 satellites tracks and the integration of their measurements into the merged discharge dataset will be also possible without additional efforts the demonstrated approach of the using non polar orbiting altimetric satellites for the estimation of river input into the arctic ocean could potentially be applied to a number of large 200 km3 y and middle size 25 km3 y eurasian rivers the exception to this are the middle sized rivers located on lena yenisey and lena kolyma interfluvial areas these rivers are not overflown by altimeters of jason series on the north american continent the jason satellites overpass the middle reaches of the mackenzie river lower reaches of yukon river as well as hudson bay rivers in kouraev et al 2004 it was shown that topex posedon altimeter jason 2 predecessor operated from 1992 to 2002 can provide an estimation of annual water flow in the arctic ob river with an accuracy of 1 3 which is comparable with that obtained in this study for jason 2 3 missions on the lena river if the accuracy of the topex poseidon water level retrievals on other arctic rivers is similar to the accuracy of the jason 2 it will give us an opportunity to construct a retrospective homogeneous record of the river water input to the arctic ocean for evaluating the hydro climatic changes acknowledgements this work was supported by the european space agency arcflux project of arctic itt we also express our gratitude towards dr v belikov institute of water problems russian academy of sciences for providing with valuable information on the lena river hydraulic specifics

standardized precipitation index spi and the palmer drought severity index pdsi are chosen to evaluate the drought monitoring utility the 3b42v7 was only evaluated with pdsi due to the short data records the results show that all the three qpes perform satisfactorily in the eastern part of china when using both spi and pdsi however their performances for west china could not be clearly

three qpes are able to detect the typical drought of the four regions with both spi and pdsi and 3b42v7 presents the least deviation in pdsi estimate spatially both chirps and 3b42v7 accurately catch the spatial centers and extent of the typical drought events while persiann cdr could not match the spatial patterns of drought events well generally the long term persiann cdr and chirps perform satisfactorily in drought detection and are suitable for drought utility however caution should be applied when studying the spatial variation of drought using persiann cdr chirps could also be suitable for near real time drought monitoring for its shorter time latency of data release the short term 3b42v7 also performs well in many cases and has thus considerable potential for drought monitoring keywords satellite based precipitation product persiann cdr chirps tmpa 3b42v7 drought monitoring mainland china 1 introduction drought is one of the costliest most frequent and most wide spread natural disaster around the world deeply impacting agricultural production and the ecological environment droughts can occur almost everywhere around the world including in humid regions dai 2011 mishra and singh 2010 lai et al 2019 under the influence of climate change the global air temperature is continuously increasing the spatiotemporal pattern of precipitation and land use is expected to significantly change over the next decades ipcc 2013 liu et al 2014 2017 mishra and lilhare 2016 tang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 hence drought disasters might be further aggravated around the world with devastating impact on the respective population dai 2013 therefore it is urgent and necessary to develop more accurate and effective drought monitoring tools as a complicated meteorological phenomenon drought has multiple manifestations and is commonly classified into several types e g meteorological drought agricultural drought and hydrological drought american meteorological society 1997 the drought index is a commonly used and effective method to quantitatively characterize and monitor drought events xu et al 2015 the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 alley 1984 and the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 are the two most widely used meteorological drought indices that utilize quite different mechanisms the pdsi is a semi physical drought index based on the balance of moisture supply and demand while the spi is a statistical drought index based on the probability distribution of long term precipitation records precipitation is a key meteorological variable for drought monitoring and for the calculation of many drought indices including both pdsi and spi conventionally precipitation data are derived from observations of in situ rain gauge networks however the rain gauge networks are often sparsely and unevenly distributed and even unavailable in some remote regions moreover unlike other meteorological variables such as air temperature precipitation always features high spatial variation and uncertainty thus it is sometimes difficult to obtain an accurate precipitation estimate via spatial interpolation tang et al 2015 wang et al 2017c since the performance of drought indices is largely influenced by the density of gauge networks trenberth et al 2014 it will be difficult for sparse and uneven distributed in situ gauge networks to meet the requirements of drought monitoring with the evolution of the remote sensing instruments and precipitation retrieval algorithms a series of semi global grid based quantitative precipitation estimate products qpes based on satellite remote sensing information were released and available to the public the most widely used qpes include the remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 2004 the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2010 2007 the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2012 with wide coverage above 50 ns latitude band high spatial resolution up to 0 25 and temporal resolution up to hourly time scale those qpes largely compensate for the deficiency of in situ rain gauge networks during the past decade the accuracy and hydrological simulation performance of the qpes have been fully evaluated around the world yong et al 2013 qiao et al 2014 shah and mishra 2014 tong et al 2014 casse et al 2015 sun et al 2016 wang et al 2017d and the qpes also have been widely applied for several meteorological or hydrological applications such as water resource exploration and the forecasting of extreme precipitations and floods awange et al 2014 casse et al 2015 pombo and oliveira 2015 nastos et al 2016 prakash et al 2016 tekeli and fouli 2016 fenta et al 2017 kim et al 2017 hobouchian et al 2017 however due to their short observation history usually shorter than 20 a applications of the qpes on the drought monitoring are usually restricted since the data records of at least 30a are required by drought index calculation guo et al 2016 to connect with the long term historical records is a verified available solution aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 sheffield et al 2013 nijssen et al 2014 shah and mishra 2015 shah et al 2017 but it usually means the extra efforts to maintain the consistency between the historical records and the qpes to satisfy the demand of studies and applications of climate and drought some long term qpes were developed such as the persiann climate data records persiann cdr ashouri et al 2014 and the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2014 2015 until now both persiann cdr and chirps have long term records of more than 30 a persiann cdr provides data records since 1983 while chirps provides data records since 1981 presenting a great potential for drought monitoring several relevant evaluations have reported that persiann cdr has high spatial and temporal consistency and exhibits good agreement of probabilistic distribution with in situ observations ashouri et al 2014 miao et al 2015 alijanian et al 2017 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 some studies proved that chirps performs well in many cases katsanos et al 2015 zambrano et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 shrestha et al 2017 moreover as the most famous qpe with the best comprehensive performance among several qpes hu et al 2013 tong et al 2014 sun et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 the tmpa 3b42 products released by the trmm mission huffman et al 2010 2007 might also have the potential for drought monitoring although they have a relatively short period of data records of only 18 a up to 2015 according to relevant studies both the tmpa 3b42 and 3b43 products can temporally and spatially catch the drought events although short term records 10 a and 12 a were used zeng et al 2012 sahoo et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 therefore both the long term products persiann cdr and chirps and the short term tmpa 3b42 products are valuable for a further exploration of their drought monitoring utility some studies have been conducted to preliminarily evaluate the drought monitoring utility of some qpes on global and regional scales such as sahoo et al 2015 who found that the post real time tmpa 3b42 products performed satisfactorily in detecting macroscale droughts even with short term data records vernimmen et al 2012 found the potential of the near real time 3b42 product for drought monitoring after bias correction guo et al 2016 found that persiann cdr is skillful for drought monitoring in eastern china but performed poorly in northwest china zambrano et al 2016 agutu et al 2017 and aadhar and mishra 2017 found that chirps performed well in drought utility in chile south asia and east africa respectively all these studies have verified the enormous potential of qpes however previous studies mostly focused on evaluating the qpes via spi a statistical based drought index while the performance of qpes adopted by the physical based drought indices e g the pdsi is relatively less reported sheffield et al 2013 and nijssen et al 2014 applied the qpes for drought monitoring using the land surface models but their efforts mainly focused on model construction and parameter estimation the pdsi with a definite physical meaning and in theory might also be an ideal drought index for qpe based drought monitoring and should be relatively less sensitive to the length of data records hence might be more suitable for some short term precipitation datasets such as the 3b42v7 product mainland china with its complicated climatic conditions large population fragile ecosystem and rapidly developing economy is vulnerable to climate change and drought disaster lai et al 2018 drought is one of the most frequent and severe natural disasters in china and has caused considerable harvest failure during past decades piao et al 2010 for example during 1999 2000 north china was affected by severe and continuous drought of two year causing a harvest failure of 20 30 wei et al 2004 during 2009 2010 a severe drought disaster hit southwest china affecting a population of nearly eight million and causing an economic loss of more than 3 5 billion u s dollars barriopedro et al 2012 moreover several regions of mainland china including some main grain producing areas tend to become drier wang et al 2017a hence it is urgent and meaningful to explore the utility of the qpes for more effective drought monitoring and forecasting in mainland china especially for areas without rain gauge however although some qpes have been evaluated individually over mainland china comprehensive evaluation and comparison of several qpes for their drought monitoring utilities over mainland china especially the evaluations using both spi and pdsi still remain unreported above all the aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the drought monitoring utility of three widely used satellite based qpes i e persiann cdr chirps and tmpa 3b42v7 hereafter abbreviated as 3b42v7 across mainland china using two widely used drought indices i e spi and pdsi this study is expected to provide a reference for the usage of the qpes for drought monitoring 2 study area datasets and methods 2 1 study area mainland china fig 1 is located on the northwestern shore of the pacific ocean comprising vast territory and various climate conditions according to xu et al 2002 mainland china could be divided into nine agricultural regions regarding different climate topography water resource vegetation and agricultural geographical distribution fig 2 including northeast china nec inner mongolia im huang huai hai plain 3hp northwest china nwc tibetan plateau tp loess plateau lp southwest china swc downstream yangtze river dyr and south china sc the division helps better understand the results of this study and has also been successfully applied in related studies wang et al 2017b li et al 2018 among the regions the tp is dominated by the alpine and plateau climate swc dyr and sc are governed by the sub tropical monsoon climate 3hp and nec are predominated by temperate monsoon climate while nwc im and lp are mainly dominated by temperate continental climate nec and 3hp are the major grain producing regions of china in which 3hp was ever affected by a continuous severe drought disaster during 1999 2000 wei et al 2004 swc has also suffered a disastrous drought that occurred over southwest china during 2009 2010 barriopedro et al 2012 zhang et al 2013a 2 2 satellite based qpe datasets persiann cdr ashouri et al 2014 is developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at the university of california irvine uci for the climate data record cdr program of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa it provides long term gridded precipitation data from 1983 onwards with a spatial resolution of 0 25 between the latitude band of 60 s to 60 n persiann cdr is built to address the need for a consistent long term and high resolution global precipitation data for studying the changes and trends in precipitation under the influence of climate change and natural variability persiann cdr is generated from the gridsat b1 infrared ir data by the persiann algorithm and has been corrected with the monthly global precipitation climatology project gpcp data to reduce bias monthly persiann cdr data from 1983 to 2015 33a were derived from the website of chrs chrsdata eng uci edu for the present study chirps funk et al 2015 2014 is developed by the climate hazards group chg providing long term precipitation data at a spatial resolution of 0 05 between the latitude band of 50 s to 50 n from 1981 to present chirps is firstly generated by merging the ir derived precipitation with the climate hazards group precipitation climatology chpclim and is then blended with the ground station observations using a modified inverse distance weighing idw method funk et al 2015 the chirps product has been updated to version 2 0 and is available on the chg website chg geog ucsb edu data to remain consistent with the persiann cdr records only the monthly chirps v2 0 data of 1983 2015 were collected and were spatially aggregated to a 0 25 resolution the tmpa 3b42 series products huffman et al 2007 2010 are level 3 products released by the trmm a satellite based precipitation measurement project jointly launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa until now tmpa 3b42 products have been updated to v7 version 3b42v7 and are available on the nasa website pmm nasa gov data access downloads trmm the 3b42v7 products provide gridded precipitation data from january 1998 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 covering the latitude band between 50 s and 50 n covering most of mainland china the 3b42v7 products consist of two products the near real time 3b42v7rt product and the post real time 3b42v7 product in which the former is generated only from the satellite remote sensing information while the latter is further corrected by the ground based rain gauge observations here we only focus on the post real time 3b42v7 product daily 3b42v7 data from 1998 to 2015 18a were collected and were aggregated into monthly time scale for the calculation of drought indices 2 3 in situ observation datasets the china gauge based precipitation daily analysis cgdpa product shen and xiong 2016 was selected as a reference to evaluate the drought monitoring utility of the qpes cgdpa is a grid based precipitation data product developed by the china meteorological administration cma covering mainland china with a spatial resolution of 0 25 cgdpa is generated from the daily precipitation observations of more than 2 400 gauge stations fig 2 distributed throughout mainland china by using an improved climatology based optimal interpolation oi method with topographic correction shen and xiong 2016 the precipitation observations used to generate the cgdpa are subject to rigorous quality control shen and xiong 2016 therefore they feature high accuracy and reliability due to the high density of the gauge network and the high quality of the precipitation observations the cgdpa is reliable and is suitable as an in situ precipitation observation reference to evaluate the qpes in this study daily cgdpa data from 1983 to 2015 33 a were downloaded from the cma website data cma cn and were accumulated to a monthly time scale for the evaluation of qpes to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet data for the calculation of pdsi several relevant meteorological data e g daily maximum and minimum air temperature wind speed and sunshine duration of 818 meteorological stations among mainland china see fig 1 were collected since the pet estimation methods might significantly influence the performance of the pdsi frank et al 2017 sheffield et al 2012 the penman monteith pm equation penman 1948 allen et al 1998 which is a physically based pet estimation method with higher accuracy and reliability was adopted to calculate the pet the shortwave radiation data required by the pm equation were converted from the sunshine duration with the angstrom formula martinez lozano et al 1985 additionally shortwave radiation data from 129 radiation stations were used to estimate linear regression parameters a and b in the angstrom formula the pet data were firstly calculated at each meteorological station and then interpolated into each 0 25 grid cell via the thin plate spline tps method green and silverman 1994 2 4 the standardized precipitation index spi and palmer drought severity index pdsi the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 is a widely used statistical drought index based on the standardization of the precipitation anomaly in the standardized procedure of the spi the precipitation records would firstly be used to fit a typical distribution e g pearson iii or gamma distribution then the frequency of each of the precipitation records would be calculated according to the fitted distribution finally these frequencies would be transformed into their corresponding quantiles of the standardized normal distribution to become the spi value the spi could also be calculated at several time scales normally 1 24 months by accumulating precipitation records before the standardized procedure to represent short and long term drought events for example the spi with a time scale of 3 months the so called spi3 represents seasonal drought while the spi at 12 month time scale spi12 represents annual drought events 2 5 the palmer drought severity index pdsi the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 is a semi physical drought index based on the land surface water balance process the pdsi considers several factors including precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture recharge hence could more comprehensively assess drought conditions under climate change liu et al 2012 sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 the pdsi is calculated by standardizing moisture departure and the moisture departure is calculated by a two layer bucket type hydrological model using precipitation and pet data with the close linkage to soil moisture the pdsi could also be used for agricultural drought dai et al 2004 dai 2011 huang et al 2015 the parameters of the standardized procedure of the conventional pdsi including the climatic characteristic and duration factors are empirically derived using the meteorological data of the central usa with its semi arid climate therefore the portability and spatial comparability of the conventional pdsi are relatively poor wells et al 2014 developed a self calibrating procedure to automatically obtain the climatic parameters that fit the local climate however this self calibrating procedure might be unsuitable for the satellite based qpes with the short term records especially for 3b42v7 a china national standard of classification of meteorological drought with standard number of gb t 20481 2006 hereafter abbreviated as gb t zhang et al 2006 provides a corrected calculation procedure of the pdsi specific for china 1 z i k m d i 2 k m 16 84 j 1 12 d j k m k m 3 k m 1 6 log 10 pe m r m ro m p m l m 2 8 d m 0 4 4 x i 0 755 x i 1 z i 1 63 where d i represents the moisture departure of time step i z i represents the moisture anomaly index k m represents the climate characteristic at month m m 1 2 12 d j represents the annual mean absolute moisture departure of month m p m l m pe m r m and ro m represent the annual mean precipitation soil moisture loss pet soil moisture recharge and runoff of month m and x i represents the pdsi value of time step i the pdsi calculation procedure of gb t is built based on long term about 40 a meteorological data of several in situ stations distributed around china hence could represent the climate characteristic of mainland china therefore this pdsi calculation procedure without the complicated self calibrating procedure of wells et al 2014 is expected to be suitable for the evaluation of the qpes over mainland china and was adopted in the present study drought classifications of spei and pdsi are listed in table 1 2 6 statistical metrics to quantify the performance of the qpes for drought monitoring several statistical metrics were adopted for the evaluation the pearson correlation coefficient cc was used to quantify the consistency between the monthly precipitation or drought indices calculated via in situ and qpe precipitation data and the root mean square error rmse was adopted to quantify the deviation of the qpe based drought indices from the references the relative bias bias was used to quantify the systematic bias of the qpes their calculation formulas are as follows 5 cc i 1 n q i q o i o i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n o i o 2 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n q i o i 2 7 b i a s q o 1 100 where q i and o i represent the precipitation records of the qpes and in situ observation respectively while q and o represent their averages higher cc and lower rmse indicate better performance probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far were adopted to evaluate the capability to detect drought events of the qpes and their calculation formulas are 8 pod n 11 n 11 n 10 9 far n 01 n 11 n 01 where n 11 represents the number of months under drought condition detected by both in situ observation and qpe n 10 represents the number of drought months that were only detected by in situ observation n 01 represents the number of drought months that were only detected by qpe higher pod and lower far indicate better capability of drought event detection 3 results and analysis 3 1 evaluation and comparison of the qpes although persiann cdr and 3b42v7 have been evaluated individually among mainland china guo et al 2016 tang et al 2016 the chirps is still less concerned suggesting a direct evaluation of the qpe precipitation is necessary fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the cc and bias for the three qpes versus in situ observations during 1998 2015 we can see that the three qpes show similar spatial patterns in correlation and bias with in situ observations with high cc over 0 9 and little bias bias between 25 and 25 among most areas of east china and east tibetan plateau indicating their high accuracies for these areas the 3b42v7 presents the highest accuracy and chirps ranks the second for the west china especially the nwc low correlations and large discrepancies between qpes and observations are found all the three qpes mainly show large overestimation in the northwest china while large underestimation is mainly found in the west of tibetan plateau comparing with fig 2 we can find that the cc and bias have high spatial correlation with the density of in situ gauges table 2 presents the quantiles of the statistical indices of the gridcells for the nine agricultural regions we can find that the regions in east china with denser gauges generally show high correlations and little bias between the qpes and in situ data nwc and tp with sparse gauges generally show lower value but with high variation in cc and much larger range of bias these results indicate that the high discrepancies of the qpes with in situ observations might be induced by lack of observation sites in the west china causing the high uncertainties for evaluations of qpes for these areas which was also mentioned by guo et al 2016 and tang et al 2016 additionally the dryer climate complicate terrain and less in situ gauges for error correction of qpes might also influence the accuracy of the qpes sahoo et al 2015 guo et al 2016 in all we suggest that the high accuracy of the qpes in the east china with dense gauge network is credible but the accuracy in most areas of west china is still uncertain due to the sparse distributed gauges the quantile quantile q q plot gao et al 2017 is an effective tool to visually assess the fitness and bias between the simulation and observation for different quantiles the q q plots of monthly precipitation of the three qpes for the nine regions can be expressed as log log coordinate for convenient assessment of low values and is shown in fig 4 for the high precipitation the qpes generally show a little underestimate in the east china while present large underestimate for nwc and tp in west china which is most likely due to the uncertainty of the sparse gauges for middle and low precipitations the three qpes for the nine regions exhibit different biases positive or negative for instances for 3hp lp nwc and tp all the three qpes shows overestimation for low precipitation for nec both persiann cdr and chirps show apparent underestimation for low values while 3b42v7 shows large overestimation for mid and low values for swc by contrast both persiann cdr and chirps show overestimation while 3b42v7 shows underestimation for mid and low precipitation for the arid and semi arid areas e g tp nwc and lp common overestimations might be caused by the local complicated landsurface less precipitation and lack of in situ data for bias correction which have also found by relevant studies tong et al 2014 for the relatively humid areas with abundant rainfall e g swc dyr and sc large discrepancies of biases of low intensity precipitation might also be caused by uncertainties and little representativeness of few samples of small rainfall months 3 2 comparison of spi and pdsi from qpes and in situ observations the spi was calculated based on persiann cdr chirps and in situ observation data at each 0 25 grid cell in mainland china from 1983 to 2015 the spi of four timescales i e the 1 3 6 and 12 month spi are calculated cc rmse pod and far were calculated from the qpe based spis against the in situ spis for the calculation of pod and far the criterion of s p i 1 0 moderate or severer drought was selected to determine the drought condition spatial patterns of the statistical metrics of qpe based spi are shown in fig 5 for persiann cdr and in fig 6 for chirps distribution metrics 5 quantile median and 95 quantile of ccs of the qpes for the nine agricultural regions are listed in table 3 persiann cdr based spi presents similar spatial pattern with those of chirps with high cc above 0 7 in the east china and low cc below 0 3 in the western part as expected those spatial patterns are also similar with those of monthly precipitation since the precipitation data are the only input to calculate spi rmse of the both qpe based spi3 shows similar spatial pattern with cc with low values below 0 8 in most of the east mainland china some regional discrepancies exist between the both qpes as shown in table 3 persiann cdr shows apparent higher cc in nec and im while chirps tends to show higher cc in southern of china including swc and sc for the four timescales of spi of both persiann cdr and chirps the spatial patterns of statistic indices do not present apparent difference while the trends of the indices in many areas increase or decrease with the increasing of timescale for instance the mid north of tp some areas of nec and dyr tend to show higher cc values while the west tp and part of nwc tend to present lower cc with larger timescales 6 to 12 month this trend could be also found in table 3 such as the low cc values 5 quantile for nec 3hp im and lp for persiann cdr and high cc values 95 quantile for nwc and tp this might be because the error of the qpes might be differently dominated by systematic or random error for different areas since the systematic error could be accumulated while the random error could be offset at the timescale increases with regard to the capability to detect drought apparently both qpes are more likely to miss drought events rather than mistake a normal state for a drought event as both pod and far are relatively low figs 5 and 6i p in the east china pod for the both qpe based spi3 is mainly between 0 5 and 0 8 indicating that 50 80 of drought months were caught by the qpes which is not very high but is still acceptable spatial discrepancies of pod and far between persiann cdr and chirps are similar to cc and rmse and the apparent regional increase decrease trends of cc along with the increased spi timescales can also be found for both pod and far since the drought indices would be more sensitive to the mid and low precipitation those trends to miss drought months might due to some overestimation of low precipitation which can be found in fig 4 and in some humid zones alijanian et al 2017 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 above all both persiann cdr and chirps are satisfactorily for spi calculation in the eastern part of mainland china for the four timescales with acceptable accuracy and capability to detect drought for the west mainland china the performance of the both products need further determine next the pdsi was calculated via persiann cdr chirps 3b42v7 and in situ precipitation data with the in situ pet data pdsi of all qpes were calculated during 1998 2015 to maintain the comparability and the corresponding cc rmse pod and far are also calculated to maintain the comparability with spi here the criterion of p d s i 2 0 moderate drought or severer was selected to determine drought condition of pdsi apparently pdsi based on the qpes shows a higher correlation with in situ observations than when using spi as the ccs are generally higher than those of spi for east china table 4 participation of the same pet data and relatively longer time scale might be the reason spatial patterns of cc and rmse for the qpe based pdsi are also similar to those of spi in fig 7 with better values in the east china and poorer values in west china 3b42v7 presents the highest accuracy among the three qpes for pdsi in east mainland china as its presents generally higher cc than persiann cdr and chirps especially for 3hp lp swc and dyr table 4 with the widest area with high cc over 0 8 and low rmse below 1 5 fig 7a f according to fig 7g l qpe based pdsis apparently have better capability for drought detection than those of spi3 shown in fig 1e h with higher pod and lower far in the east china three qpe based pdsis present high pod mainly above 0 7 indicating that more than 70 of drought events were caught by the qpes referring to fig 1e h similar regional differences between the qpes can also be found in fig 7g l as pdsi of 3b42v7 and chirps presents higher pod than persiann cdr in southwest china in summary three qpes perform well in the eastern part of china when using pdsi 3b42v7 presents best performance with higher accuracy in many cases 3 3 case studies of typical drought affected regions to further temporally and spatially evaluate the drought indices estimated from all three qpes four typical drought affected regions are selected from the nine agricultural regions for regional specific case studies including northeast china nec huang huai hai plain 3hp southwest china swc and loess plateau lp the 3hp and swc are selected to analyze two typical drought events i e the continuous drought of 1999 2000 in north china wei et al 2004 and the severe drought of 2009 2010 in southwest china barriopedro et al 2012 zhang et al 2013a b the nec is selected due to a major grain producing region of china the lp is selected for its fragile environment sensitive to drought zhang et al 2013b 2016 and it could also represent the performance of the qpes in the semi arid areas the drought events from jan 2001 to jan 2002 in nec and from sep 1999 to sep 2000 in lp are selected as typical drought events for nec and lp respectively the agricultural regions of west china are not considered because of the sparse and uneven distributed gauge network additionally we did not consider the meteorological drought for the arid areas like the northwest china xu et al 2015 for a brief only the 3 month spi spi3 that is more capable to reveal seasonal drought xu et al 2015 was selected as a represent case for the following regional evaluations time series of regional averaged spi3 and fractional drought area based on persiann cdr and chirps for the four regions are shown in fig 8 ccs and rmses of the regional averaged spi3 are listed in table 5 both persiann cdr and chirps are able to accurately detect typical drought events of all four regions as their spi3 could catch the start and end of the drought events although some biases were found in drought intensity estimates fig 8 for the four regions nec 3hp swc and lp spi3 of both qpes fit well with in situ observations fig 8 for lp agreement between the qpes and in situ observations is poorest but the qpes can still identify the drought events fig 8d h and the ccs are still high persiann cdr outperforms chirps for the four regions for temporal correlation but their differences are small table 5 spatial patterns of the spi3 in the specific month of the typical drought events for the four regions are shown in fig 9 the drought intensity was roughly reflected by both persiann cdr and chirps persiann cdr could not accurately match the spatial pattern of the typical drought events for the four regions especially for 3hp and swc although it performs satisfactorily for the temporal evaluation above in comparison chirps picks up the spatial centers and extent of the typical drought events relatively accurately although some underestimates of drought intensity are found spatial ccs of the qpes against in situ observations for the four typical drought events are listed in table 5 among the four regions both qpes present the highest spatial correlation in 3hp ccs of nearly 0 8 while the poorest correlation is found in lp ccs of 0 344 to 0 537 we then evaluated and compared the performance of the qpes in pdsi estimating including 3b42v7 fig 10 presents the time series of regional averaged pdsi and the fractional drought area based on pdsi for the three qpes qpes fit well with in situ observations when using pdsi and their correlations with in situ observations are even better than when using spi3 drought events for the four regions were all accurately caught by all three qpes among the qpes 3b42v7 performed the best with the least deviation in the estimates of drought severity in comparison some apparent underestimates and overestimates can be found in both persiann cdr and chirps estimates fig 10 table 5 also lists the temporal ccs of the qpe based pdsi for the four regions 3b42v7 presents the best agreement with in situ observations in pdsi estimation as it features the highest ccs and lowest rmses for all four regions discrepancies between persiann cdr and chirps of pdsi are similar with those of spi3 as persiann cdr performs slightly better than chirps for the four regions similar to fig 9 spatial maps of the pdsi in the specific month of the typical drought events are also shown in fig 11 apparently spatial consistencies of persiann cdr and chirps are also mostly improved when spi3 is replaced by pdsi especially for nec and swc but except for 3hp all the three qpes caught the spatial centers and extent of the drought events for the four regions persiann cdr still generally presents the poorest spatial correlation with in situ data table 5 and shows the poorest skill to match the spatial pattern of drought when using pdsi fig 11 but the gap with other qpes is apparently reduced especially in swc among the four regions the spatial correlation of the qpe drived pdsi is poorest in lp but it is still acceptable 4 discussion 4 1 validation of the gb t based pdsi the gb t 20481 2006 national standard zhang et al 2006 provides a modified pdsi calculation procedure that considers the climate characteristic of china to rationalize and simplify pdsi calculation in china however few studies focused on the reliability of the gb t procedure when using qpe data therefore it is necessary to verify the capability of the gb t procedure for the calculation with satellite qpe data in the present study according to fig 12 distributions of the different pdsi based drought classifications of both in situ data and qpes are generally reasonable for both the whole mainland china and the four regions fig 12 specifically the frequencies of normal spell 1 p d s i 1 mainly ranged from 0 35 to 0 40 while frequencies of extreme drought spell p d s i 4 are nearly 0 025 which is similar to normal distribution and roughly meets the aim of the self calibrating procedure proposed by wells et al 2014 please note that frequencies of extreme wet spell p d s i 4 are a little overestimated for some regions fig 12a b d however their impact on drought monitoring could be ignored distributions of the drought classifications of the regions except nec are similar with those of the whole mainland china while nec relatively underestimates the frequency of normal spell nearly 0 30 but is still acceptable fig 12a therefore we suggest that the gb t based pdsi has satisfactory adaptability and spatial comparability for mainland china and is reasonable for the qpe based pdsi calculation in the present study moreover although the pdsi of gb t has considered the climate characteristic of china several local climatic components are also included hence reliability of pdsi might also be impacted by the length of the data records therefore the reasonability of using short term qpe data to calculate the pdsi in the present study also requires verification we additionally calculated the gb t based pdsi with longer in situ observation records of 1983 2015 33 a with 3hp and swc as example we compared the pdsi temporally and spatially based on the 33 a and 18 a 1998 2015 same as 3b42v7 of in situ data and 3b42v7 data of 1998 2015 18 a fig 13 apparently high temporal consistency between the pdsi derived from 33 a and 18 a in situ data can be found as their time series nearly coincided especially in 3hp fig 13a b spatially the pdsi of 18 a in situ data accurately match the spatial pattern of the typical drought in the both regions shown by the pdsi of 33 a data fig 13c d e f fig 13 also shows that 3b42v7 based pdsi presents a high temporal and spatial correlation with in situ data of both 33 a and 18 a this shows that the short term qpes e g 3b42v7 also have great potential for drought monitoring when using the gb t pdsi in mainland china sahoo et al 2015 also performed a similar validation on the spi calculated via long term 31 a and short term 10 a data records respectively they also found that the length of data records presents little impact on the spi calculation and supposed that it might be because both normal and extreme events are included in the period of data record as both several severe drought and flood disasters have taken placed during the past two decades in china piao et al 2010 might also explain our findings as a result we suggest that the evaluation in the present study using the precipitation data with 18 a records for pdsi is reasonable 4 2 comparison of the usability of the satellite qpes in drought monitoring according to the results above temporally all three qpes generally performed well for drought detection in the eastern part of china even including the southwest and mid west area of china although persiann cdr presents superior performance in several regions chirps also performs satisfactorily in where persiann cdr performs well comparability of chirps to persiann cdr also can be found in the humid and semi arid area of other countries dembélé and zwart 2016 zambrano et al 2016 hence both persiann cdr and chirps are capable to be used for regional drought monitoring and even have great potential to substitute the in situ gauge observations in these areas however persiann cdr is relatively weak in revealing spatial patterns of drought events since persiann cdr is corrected by the gridded gpcp data ashouri et al 2014 while chirps and 3b42v7 are corrected by the station data the coarse spatial resolution 2 5 of gpcp might be a reason of the poorer spatial performance as a result caution should be taken when studying the spatial characteristics of drought with persiann cdr 3b42v7 performs superior than the other two qpes over the east of china and its drought utility has also been validated in other studies sahoo et al 2015 zeng et al 2012 however due to its short data records stability and reasonability of 3b42v7 for drought monitoring or other climatic applications it might need further evaluation as there are still only few case studies specifically we evaluated the 3b42v7 via only pdsi in mainland china nevertheless 3b42v7 also shows considerable potential for drought monitoring for west china large differences between the qpes and in situ data are found not only in the present study but also in the studies of tang et al 2016 guo et al 2016 and shen and xiong 2016 which pointed out that the sparse gauge networks in west china largely limit the evaluation of qpes we believe the large differences might be induced by the low quality of the qpes caused by the dry climate special land surface and lack of in situ error correction gao and liu 2013 sahoo et al 2015 guo et al 2016 similar to shen and xiong 2016 here we further explored the accuracy of the qpes for the two gauge sparse regions of west china i e nwc and tp by only evaluating the gauged gridcells for the two regions distributions of the cc and bias of the qpes for the two regions at all or only gauged gridcells are shown by the quantiles in table 6 low cc values 5 and 25 quantile of the three qpes are apparently higher for the gauged gridcells than the all gridcells for both nwc and tp and in some cases ranges of bias are smaller for the gauged gridcells e g tp less change of the high cc values 75 and 95 quantile indicates that the gridcells with higher accuracy of qpes are mainly located with gauges however compared with the regions in east china ccs are generally still low and the ranges of bias are still large for nwc and tp even only the gauged gridcells are evaluated as the medians 50 quantile of ccs for nwc are even below 0 8 and biases are ranging from down to 50 to up to 140 for both nwc and tp for the three qpes this might also reveal the inherent poor accuracy for the qpes indicating the unsuitability of the qpes for drought monitoring over these areas denser gauge networks might also be an important reason for the higher accuracy of the qpes as they could obtain better bias correction in these areas which was also mentioned by sahoo et al 2015 especially for chirps and 3b42v7 in all we suggest that the large differences between the qpes and in situ data in the west china are induced by both the sparse gauge networks and the low accuracy of the qpes therefore the performance of the three qpes in west china may be beyond acceptable limits and then the current qpes are not recommended for drought monitoring further evaluation and correction of the qpes using local gauge observations for these areas would be necessary for further works although the present study evaluates three qpes only in mainland china we hope that our results can be used as reference for other regions around the world in a global evaluation sahoo et al 2015 reported that post process 3b42 products present high agreement with non tmpa products than the near real time one without in situ correction in the regions with dense gauge networks e g the eastern usa eastern south america southern africa india south eastern asia and australia those findings are similar with our findings and discussion above and reveal the importance of the in situ bias correction for the qpes significant improvements of the accuracy of near real time qpes after in situ correction have also been validated by aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 and vernimmen et al 2012 for global and regional scales respectively in all we expect that the qpes might also perform similarly in the areas discussed by former studies above at present we have confirmed the utility of the three qpes for the retrospective drought assessment however usability of the qpes for the real time or near real time drought applications is also important and thus needs discussion it takes quite a long time to process and obtain the in situ observations for error correction and thus some days are required before the release of the global scale data of chirps and 3b42v7 therefore these two qpes may be unsuitable for the strict real time applications however since drought is a long term phenomenon with much larger timescale than flood and rain storm the latency of data release of the two qpes might be acceptable for the near real time drought monitoring the lag time of persiann cdr is longer usually several months later as this qpe mainly aims at the researches of historical climate ashouri et al 2014 and therefore the persiann cdr might be only suitable for the retrospective historical drought assessment some efforts have been made to develop the real time or near real time long term qpes with higher timeliness by combining the short term near real time qpes and long term qpes e g gpcp aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 developed a near real time qpe by combining the near real time 3b42rt and persiann products and the long term gpcp product but the spatial resolution of up to 0 5 might not meet the requirement of local drought monitoring aadhar and mishra 2017 also developed a near real time qpe with high quality and spatial resolution up to 0 05 while it is only specific for south asia accordingly the global or semi global scale high spatial resolution long term real time qpes still require further development above all for most of the eastern part of china long term persiann cdr and chirps perform satisfactorily and are suitable for drought utilities in which chirps could also be applied for near real time drought monitoring the short term qpe 3b42v7 also shows great potential for drought monitoring for west china the qpes are not suitable for drought monitoring in these areas 5 conclusions this study mainly evaluated and compared the drought monitoring utilities of the two long term satellite qpes i e persiann cdr since 1983 and chirps since 1981 and a short term qpe i e tmpa 3b42v7 since 1998 over mainland china cgdpa a gridded precipitation dataset generated from the dense rain gauge networks in mainland china was used as in situ observations to evaluate the qpes both the spi and the pdsi the two most widely used meteorological drought indices were selected as examples to verify the drought utility of the qpes a three qpes generally show high monthly accuracy in east china with high correlation with in situ observations and little bias but the accuracy for west china could not be clearly ensured due to the sparse in situ gauge networks underestimations of high precipitation normally exist in the qpes while different types of bias over or underestimations of mid and low precipitation are found for the qpes b for the evaluation with spi with reference to in situ observations spi of both persiann cdr and chirps present similar spatial patterns with high correlation in east part of mainland china while low correlation in west china e g nwc and tp as the timescale of spi increases accuracy of qpe based spis consistently increase or decreases for different regions with regard to the evaluation with pdsi spatial patterns and discrepancies of the qpes are similar with those of spi3 3b42v7 presents the best performance among the three qpes with higher cc and pod in many cases c temporally when using spi with spi3 as example both persiann cdr and chirps are able to catch the typical drought events for the four agricultural regions i e northeast china nec huang huai hai plain 3hp southwest china swc and loess plateau lp however the persiann cdr is relatively weak in matching the spatial pattern of the typical drought events while chirps could accurately catch the spatial extent and centers of drought events d when turned to pdsi persiann cdr still has the poorest spatial performance for detecting typical drought events 3b42v7 drived pdsi features the best temporal performance among all three qpes with least deviation from the in situ data and performs comparably with chirps in detecting the spatial pattern of typical drought events in summary the long term persiann cdr and chirps are suitable for drought monitoring in the eastern part of mainland china regardless of whether spi or pdsi are used however caution should be applied when using persiann cdr to study the spatial variation of drought the short term 3b42v7 product also performed satisfactorily in drought detection when using pdsi presenting considerable potential for drought monitoring however for west china all three qpes perform unacceptably indicating the unsuitability of the qpes for drought monitoring in these areas acknowledgements

6818,this study mainly evaluated and compared satellite based quantitative precipitation estimate products qpes for the drought monitoring of mainland china two long term more than 30 a satellite based qpes i e the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr and the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps and a short term 18a qpe i e the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42v7 are considered two widely used drought indices the standardized precipitation index spi and the palmer drought severity index pdsi are chosen to evaluate the drought monitoring utility the 3b42v7 was only evaluated with pdsi due to the short data records the results show that all the three qpes perform satisfactorily in the eastern part of china when using both spi and pdsi however their performances for west china could not be clearly determined due to the sparse gauge networks 3b42v7 features best performance among the three qpes in the evaluation using pdsi to further spatiotemporally evaluate the drought utility of the qpes four typical drought affected regions i e northeast china nec huang huai hai plain 3hp southwest china swc and loess plateau lp were extracted from mainland china for specific case studies temporally all three qpes are able to detect the typical drought of the four regions with both spi and pdsi and 3b42v7 presents the least deviation in pdsi estimate spatially both chirps and 3b42v7 accurately catch the spatial centers and extent of the typical drought events while persiann cdr could not match the spatial patterns of drought events well generally the long term persiann cdr and chirps perform satisfactorily in drought detection and are suitable for drought utility however caution should be applied when studying the spatial variation of drought using persiann cdr chirps could also be suitable for near real time drought monitoring for its shorter time latency of data release the short term 3b42v7 also performs well in many cases and has thus considerable potential for drought monitoring keywords satellite based precipitation product persiann cdr chirps tmpa 3b42v7 drought monitoring mainland china 1 introduction drought is one of the costliest most frequent and most wide spread natural disaster around the world deeply impacting agricultural production and the ecological environment droughts can occur almost everywhere around the world including in humid regions dai 2011 mishra and singh 2010 lai et al 2019 under the influence of climate change the global air temperature is continuously increasing the spatiotemporal pattern of precipitation and land use is expected to significantly change over the next decades ipcc 2013 liu et al 2014 2017 mishra and lilhare 2016 tang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 hence drought disasters might be further aggravated around the world with devastating impact on the respective population dai 2013 therefore it is urgent and necessary to develop more accurate and effective drought monitoring tools as a complicated meteorological phenomenon drought has multiple manifestations and is commonly classified into several types e g meteorological drought agricultural drought and hydrological drought american meteorological society 1997 the drought index is a commonly used and effective method to quantitatively characterize and monitor drought events xu et al 2015 the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 alley 1984 and the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 are the two most widely used meteorological drought indices that utilize quite different mechanisms the pdsi is a semi physical drought index based on the balance of moisture supply and demand while the spi is a statistical drought index based on the probability distribution of long term precipitation records precipitation is a key meteorological variable for drought monitoring and for the calculation of many drought indices including both pdsi and spi conventionally precipitation data are derived from observations of in situ rain gauge networks however the rain gauge networks are often sparsely and unevenly distributed and even unavailable in some remote regions moreover unlike other meteorological variables such as air temperature precipitation always features high spatial variation and uncertainty thus it is sometimes difficult to obtain an accurate precipitation estimate via spatial interpolation tang et al 2015 wang et al 2017c since the performance of drought indices is largely influenced by the density of gauge networks trenberth et al 2014 it will be difficult for sparse and uneven distributed in situ gauge networks to meet the requirements of drought monitoring with the evolution of the remote sensing instruments and precipitation retrieval algorithms a series of semi global grid based quantitative precipitation estimate products qpes based on satellite remote sensing information were released and available to the public the most widely used qpes include the remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 2004 the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2010 2007 the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2012 with wide coverage above 50 ns latitude band high spatial resolution up to 0 25 and temporal resolution up to hourly time scale those qpes largely compensate for the deficiency of in situ rain gauge networks during the past decade the accuracy and hydrological simulation performance of the qpes have been fully evaluated around the world yong et al 2013 qiao et al 2014 shah and mishra 2014 tong et al 2014 casse et al 2015 sun et al 2016 wang et al 2017d and the qpes also have been widely applied for several meteorological or hydrological applications such as water resource exploration and the forecasting of extreme precipitations and floods awange et al 2014 casse et al 2015 pombo and oliveira 2015 nastos et al 2016 prakash et al 2016 tekeli and fouli 2016 fenta et al 2017 kim et al 2017 hobouchian et al 2017 however due to their short observation history usually shorter than 20 a applications of the qpes on the drought monitoring are usually restricted since the data records of at least 30a are required by drought index calculation guo et al 2016 to connect with the long term historical records is a verified available solution aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 sheffield et al 2013 nijssen et al 2014 shah and mishra 2015 shah et al 2017 but it usually means the extra efforts to maintain the consistency between the historical records and the qpes to satisfy the demand of studies and applications of climate and drought some long term qpes were developed such as the persiann climate data records persiann cdr ashouri et al 2014 and the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2014 2015 until now both persiann cdr and chirps have long term records of more than 30 a persiann cdr provides data records since 1983 while chirps provides data records since 1981 presenting a great potential for drought monitoring several relevant evaluations have reported that persiann cdr has high spatial and temporal consistency and exhibits good agreement of probabilistic distribution with in situ observations ashouri et al 2014 miao et al 2015 alijanian et al 2017 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 some studies proved that chirps performs well in many cases katsanos et al 2015 zambrano et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 shrestha et al 2017 moreover as the most famous qpe with the best comprehensive performance among several qpes hu et al 2013 tong et al 2014 sun et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 the tmpa 3b42 products released by the trmm mission huffman et al 2010 2007 might also have the potential for drought monitoring although they have a relatively short period of data records of only 18 a up to 2015 according to relevant studies both the tmpa 3b42 and 3b43 products can temporally and spatially catch the drought events although short term records 10 a and 12 a were used zeng et al 2012 sahoo et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 therefore both the long term products persiann cdr and chirps and the short term tmpa 3b42 products are valuable for a further exploration of their drought monitoring utility some studies have been conducted to preliminarily evaluate the drought monitoring utility of some qpes on global and regional scales such as sahoo et al 2015 who found that the post real time tmpa 3b42 products performed satisfactorily in detecting macroscale droughts even with short term data records vernimmen et al 2012 found the potential of the near real time 3b42 product for drought monitoring after bias correction guo et al 2016 found that persiann cdr is skillful for drought monitoring in eastern china but performed poorly in northwest china zambrano et al 2016 agutu et al 2017 and aadhar and mishra 2017 found that chirps performed well in drought utility in chile south asia and east africa respectively all these studies have verified the enormous potential of qpes however previous studies mostly focused on evaluating the qpes via spi a statistical based drought index while the performance of qpes adopted by the physical based drought indices e g the pdsi is relatively less reported sheffield et al 2013 and nijssen et al 2014 applied the qpes for drought monitoring using the land surface models but their efforts mainly focused on model construction and parameter estimation the pdsi with a definite physical meaning and in theory might also be an ideal drought index for qpe based drought monitoring and should be relatively less sensitive to the length of data records hence might be more suitable for some short term precipitation datasets such as the 3b42v7 product mainland china with its complicated climatic conditions large population fragile ecosystem and rapidly developing economy is vulnerable to climate change and drought disaster lai et al 2018 drought is one of the most frequent and severe natural disasters in china and has caused considerable harvest failure during past decades piao et al 2010 for example during 1999 2000 north china was affected by severe and continuous drought of two year causing a harvest failure of 20 30 wei et al 2004 during 2009 2010 a severe drought disaster hit southwest china affecting a population of nearly eight million and causing an economic loss of more than 3 5 billion u s dollars barriopedro et al 2012 moreover several regions of mainland china including some main grain producing areas tend to become drier wang et al 2017a hence it is urgent and meaningful to explore the utility of the qpes for more effective drought monitoring and forecasting in mainland china especially for areas without rain gauge however although some qpes have been evaluated individually over mainland china comprehensive evaluation and comparison of several qpes for their drought monitoring utilities over mainland china especially the evaluations using both spi and pdsi still remain unreported above all the aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the drought monitoring utility of three widely used satellite based qpes i e persiann cdr chirps and tmpa 3b42v7 hereafter abbreviated as 3b42v7 across mainland china using two widely used drought indices i e spi and pdsi this study is expected to provide a reference for the usage of the qpes for drought monitoring 2 study area datasets and methods 2 1 study area mainland china fig 1 is located on the northwestern shore of the pacific ocean comprising vast territory and various climate conditions according to xu et al 2002 mainland china could be divided into nine agricultural regions regarding different climate topography water resource vegetation and agricultural geographical distribution fig 2 including northeast china nec inner mongolia im huang huai hai plain 3hp northwest china nwc tibetan plateau tp loess plateau lp southwest china swc downstream yangtze river dyr and south china sc the division helps better understand the results of this study and has also been successfully applied in related studies wang et al 2017b li et al 2018 among the regions the tp is dominated by the alpine and plateau climate swc dyr and sc are governed by the sub tropical monsoon climate 3hp and nec are predominated by temperate monsoon climate while nwc im and lp are mainly dominated by temperate continental climate nec and 3hp are the major grain producing regions of china in which 3hp was ever affected by a continuous severe drought disaster during 1999 2000 wei et al 2004 swc has also suffered a disastrous drought that occurred over southwest china during 2009 2010 barriopedro et al 2012 zhang et al 2013a 2 2 satellite based qpe datasets persiann cdr ashouri et al 2014 is developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at the university of california irvine uci for the climate data record cdr program of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa it provides long term gridded precipitation data from 1983 onwards with a spatial resolution of 0 25 between the latitude band of 60 s to 60 n persiann cdr is built to address the need for a consistent long term and high resolution global precipitation data for studying the changes and trends in precipitation under the influence of climate change and natural variability persiann cdr is generated from the gridsat b1 infrared ir data by the persiann algorithm and has been corrected with the monthly global precipitation climatology project gpcp data to reduce bias monthly persiann cdr data from 1983 to 2015 33a were derived from the website of chrs chrsdata eng uci edu for the present study chirps funk et al 2015 2014 is developed by the climate hazards group chg providing long term precipitation data at a spatial resolution of 0 05 between the latitude band of 50 s to 50 n from 1981 to present chirps is firstly generated by merging the ir derived precipitation with the climate hazards group precipitation climatology chpclim and is then blended with the ground station observations using a modified inverse distance weighing idw method funk et al 2015 the chirps product has been updated to version 2 0 and is available on the chg website chg geog ucsb edu data to remain consistent with the persiann cdr records only the monthly chirps v2 0 data of 1983 2015 were collected and were spatially aggregated to a 0 25 resolution the tmpa 3b42 series products huffman et al 2007 2010 are level 3 products released by the trmm a satellite based precipitation measurement project jointly launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa until now tmpa 3b42 products have been updated to v7 version 3b42v7 and are available on the nasa website pmm nasa gov data access downloads trmm the 3b42v7 products provide gridded precipitation data from january 1998 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 covering the latitude band between 50 s and 50 n covering most of mainland china the 3b42v7 products consist of two products the near real time 3b42v7rt product and the post real time 3b42v7 product in which the former is generated only from the satellite remote sensing information while the latter is further corrected by the ground based rain gauge observations here we only focus on the post real time 3b42v7 product daily 3b42v7 data from 1998 to 2015 18a were collected and were aggregated into monthly time scale for the calculation of drought indices 2 3 in situ observation datasets the china gauge based precipitation daily analysis cgdpa product shen and xiong 2016 was selected as a reference to evaluate the drought monitoring utility of the qpes cgdpa is a grid based precipitation data product developed by the china meteorological administration cma covering mainland china with a spatial resolution of 0 25 cgdpa is generated from the daily precipitation observations of more than 2 400 gauge stations fig 2 distributed throughout mainland china by using an improved climatology based optimal interpolation oi method with topographic correction shen and xiong 2016 the precipitation observations used to generate the cgdpa are subject to rigorous quality control shen and xiong 2016 therefore they feature high accuracy and reliability due to the high density of the gauge network and the high quality of the precipitation observations the cgdpa is reliable and is suitable as an in situ precipitation observation reference to evaluate the qpes in this study daily cgdpa data from 1983 to 2015 33 a were downloaded from the cma website data cma cn and were accumulated to a monthly time scale for the evaluation of qpes to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet data for the calculation of pdsi several relevant meteorological data e g daily maximum and minimum air temperature wind speed and sunshine duration of 818 meteorological stations among mainland china see fig 1 were collected since the pet estimation methods might significantly influence the performance of the pdsi frank et al 2017 sheffield et al 2012 the penman monteith pm equation penman 1948 allen et al 1998 which is a physically based pet estimation method with higher accuracy and reliability was adopted to calculate the pet the shortwave radiation data required by the pm equation were converted from the sunshine duration with the angstrom formula martinez lozano et al 1985 additionally shortwave radiation data from 129 radiation stations were used to estimate linear regression parameters a and b in the angstrom formula the pet data were firstly calculated at each meteorological station and then interpolated into each 0 25 grid cell via the thin plate spline tps method green and silverman 1994 2 4 the standardized precipitation index spi and palmer drought severity index pdsi the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 is a widely used statistical drought index based on the standardization of the precipitation anomaly in the standardized procedure of the spi the precipitation records would firstly be used to fit a typical distribution e g pearson iii or gamma distribution then the frequency of each of the precipitation records would be calculated according to the fitted distribution finally these frequencies would be transformed into their corresponding quantiles of the standardized normal distribution to become the spi value the spi could also be calculated at several time scales normally 1 24 months by accumulating precipitation records before the standardized procedure to represent short and long term drought events for example the spi with a time scale of 3 months the so called spi3 represents seasonal drought while the spi at 12 month time scale spi12 represents annual drought events 2 5 the palmer drought severity index pdsi the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 is a semi physical drought index based on the land surface water balance process the pdsi considers several factors including precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture recharge hence could more comprehensively assess drought conditions under climate change liu et al 2012 sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 the pdsi is calculated by standardizing moisture departure and the moisture departure is calculated by a two layer bucket type hydrological model using precipitation and pet data with the close linkage to soil moisture the pdsi could also be used for agricultural drought dai et al 2004 dai 2011 huang et al 2015 the parameters of the standardized procedure of the conventional pdsi including the climatic characteristic and duration factors are empirically derived using the meteorological data of the central usa with its semi arid climate therefore the portability and spatial comparability of the conventional pdsi are relatively poor wells et al 2014 developed a self calibrating procedure to automatically obtain the climatic parameters that fit the local climate however this self calibrating procedure might be unsuitable for the satellite based qpes with the short term records especially for 3b42v7 a china national standard of classification of meteorological drought with standard number of gb t 20481 2006 hereafter abbreviated as gb t zhang et al 2006 provides a corrected calculation procedure of the pdsi specific for china 1 z i k m d i 2 k m 16 84 j 1 12 d j k m k m 3 k m 1 6 log 10 pe m r m ro m p m l m 2 8 d m 0 4 4 x i 0 755 x i 1 z i 1 63 where d i represents the moisture departure of time step i z i represents the moisture anomaly index k m represents the climate characteristic at month m m 1 2 12 d j represents the annual mean absolute moisture departure of month m p m l m pe m r m and ro m represent the annual mean precipitation soil moisture loss pet soil moisture recharge and runoff of month m and x i represents the pdsi value of time step i the pdsi calculation procedure of gb t is built based on long term about 40 a meteorological data of several in situ stations distributed around china hence could represent the climate characteristic of mainland china therefore this pdsi calculation procedure without the complicated self calibrating procedure of wells et al 2014 is expected to be suitable for the evaluation of the qpes over mainland china and was adopted in the present study drought classifications of spei and pdsi are listed in table 1 2 6 statistical metrics to quantify the performance of the qpes for drought monitoring several statistical metrics were adopted for the evaluation the pearson correlation coefficient cc was used to quantify the consistency between the monthly precipitation or drought indices calculated via in situ and qpe precipitation data and the root mean square error rmse was adopted to quantify the deviation of the qpe based drought indices from the references the relative bias bias was used to quantify the systematic bias of the qpes their calculation formulas are as follows 5 cc i 1 n q i q o i o i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n o i o 2 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n q i o i 2 7 b i a s q o 1 100 where q i and o i represent the precipitation records of the qpes and in situ observation respectively while q and o represent their averages higher cc and lower rmse indicate better performance probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far were adopted to evaluate the capability to detect drought events of the qpes and their calculation formulas are 8 pod n 11 n 11 n 10 9 far n 01 n 11 n 01 where n 11 represents the number of months under drought condition detected by both in situ observation and qpe n 10 represents the number of drought months that were only detected by in situ observation n 01 represents the number of drought months that were only detected by qpe higher pod and lower far indicate better capability of drought event detection 3 results and analysis 3 1 evaluation and comparison of the qpes although persiann cdr and 3b42v7 have been evaluated individually among mainland china guo et al 2016 tang et al 2016 the chirps is still less concerned suggesting a direct evaluation of the qpe precipitation is necessary fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the cc and bias for the three qpes versus in situ observations during 1998 2015 we can see that the three qpes show similar spatial patterns in correlation and bias with in situ observations with high cc over 0 9 and little bias bias between 25 and 25 among most areas of east china and east tibetan plateau indicating their high accuracies for these areas the 3b42v7 presents the highest accuracy and chirps ranks the second for the west china especially the nwc low correlations and large discrepancies between qpes and observations are found all the three qpes mainly show large overestimation in the northwest china while large underestimation is mainly found in the west of tibetan plateau comparing with fig 2 we can find that the cc and bias have high spatial correlation with the density of in situ gauges table 2 presents the quantiles of the statistical indices of the gridcells for the nine agricultural regions we can find that the regions in east china with denser gauges generally show high correlations and little bias between the qpes and in situ data nwc and tp with sparse gauges generally show lower value but with high variation in cc and much larger range of bias these results indicate that the high discrepancies of the qpes with in situ observations might be induced by lack of observation sites in the west china causing the high uncertainties for evaluations of qpes for these areas which was also mentioned by guo et al 2016 and tang et al 2016 additionally the dryer climate complicate terrain and less in situ gauges for error correction of qpes might also influence the accuracy of the qpes sahoo et al 2015 guo et al 2016 in all we suggest that the high accuracy of the qpes in the east china with dense gauge network is credible but the accuracy in most areas of west china is still uncertain due to the sparse distributed gauges the quantile quantile q q plot gao et al 2017 is an effective tool to visually assess the fitness and bias between the simulation and observation for different quantiles the q q plots of monthly precipitation of the three qpes for the nine regions can be expressed as log log coordinate for convenient assessment of low values and is shown in fig 4 for the high precipitation the qpes generally show a little underestimate in the east china while present large underestimate for nwc and tp in west china which is most likely due to the uncertainty of the sparse gauges for middle and low precipitations the three qpes for the nine regions exhibit different biases positive or negative for instances for 3hp lp nwc and tp all the three qpes shows overestimation for low precipitation for nec both persiann cdr and chirps show apparent underestimation for low values while 3b42v7 shows large overestimation for mid and low values for swc by contrast both persiann cdr and chirps show overestimation while 3b42v7 shows underestimation for mid and low precipitation for the arid and semi arid areas e g tp nwc and lp common overestimations might be caused by the local complicated landsurface less precipitation and lack of in situ data for bias correction which have also found by relevant studies tong et al 2014 for the relatively humid areas with abundant rainfall e g swc dyr and sc large discrepancies of biases of low intensity precipitation might also be caused by uncertainties and little representativeness of few samples of small rainfall months 3 2 comparison of spi and pdsi from qpes and in situ observations the spi was calculated based on persiann cdr chirps and in situ observation data at each 0 25 grid cell in mainland china from 1983 to 2015 the spi of four timescales i e the 1 3 6 and 12 month spi are calculated cc rmse pod and far were calculated from the qpe based spis against the in situ spis for the calculation of pod and far the criterion of s p i 1 0 moderate or severer drought was selected to determine the drought condition spatial patterns of the statistical metrics of qpe based spi are shown in fig 5 for persiann cdr and in fig 6 for chirps distribution metrics 5 quantile median and 95 quantile of ccs of the qpes for the nine agricultural regions are listed in table 3 persiann cdr based spi presents similar spatial pattern with those of chirps with high cc above 0 7 in the east china and low cc below 0 3 in the western part as expected those spatial patterns are also similar with those of monthly precipitation since the precipitation data are the only input to calculate spi rmse of the both qpe based spi3 shows similar spatial pattern with cc with low values below 0 8 in most of the east mainland china some regional discrepancies exist between the both qpes as shown in table 3 persiann cdr shows apparent higher cc in nec and im while chirps tends to show higher cc in southern of china including swc and sc for the four timescales of spi of both persiann cdr and chirps the spatial patterns of statistic indices do not present apparent difference while the trends of the indices in many areas increase or decrease with the increasing of timescale for instance the mid north of tp some areas of nec and dyr tend to show higher cc values while the west tp and part of nwc tend to present lower cc with larger timescales 6 to 12 month this trend could be also found in table 3 such as the low cc values 5 quantile for nec 3hp im and lp for persiann cdr and high cc values 95 quantile for nwc and tp this might be because the error of the qpes might be differently dominated by systematic or random error for different areas since the systematic error could be accumulated while the random error could be offset at the timescale increases with regard to the capability to detect drought apparently both qpes are more likely to miss drought events rather than mistake a normal state for a drought event as both pod and far are relatively low figs 5 and 6i p in the east china pod for the both qpe based spi3 is mainly between 0 5 and 0 8 indicating that 50 80 of drought months were caught by the qpes which is not very high but is still acceptable spatial discrepancies of pod and far between persiann cdr and chirps are similar to cc and rmse and the apparent regional increase decrease trends of cc along with the increased spi timescales can also be found for both pod and far since the drought indices would be more sensitive to the mid and low precipitation those trends to miss drought months might due to some overestimation of low precipitation which can be found in fig 4 and in some humid zones alijanian et al 2017 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 above all both persiann cdr and chirps are satisfactorily for spi calculation in the eastern part of mainland china for the four timescales with acceptable accuracy and capability to detect drought for the west mainland china the performance of the both products need further determine next the pdsi was calculated via persiann cdr chirps 3b42v7 and in situ precipitation data with the in situ pet data pdsi of all qpes were calculated during 1998 2015 to maintain the comparability and the corresponding cc rmse pod and far are also calculated to maintain the comparability with spi here the criterion of p d s i 2 0 moderate drought or severer was selected to determine drought condition of pdsi apparently pdsi based on the qpes shows a higher correlation with in situ observations than when using spi as the ccs are generally higher than those of spi for east china table 4 participation of the same pet data and relatively longer time scale might be the reason spatial patterns of cc and rmse for the qpe based pdsi are also similar to those of spi in fig 7 with better values in the east china and poorer values in west china 3b42v7 presents the highest accuracy among the three qpes for pdsi in east mainland china as its presents generally higher cc than persiann cdr and chirps especially for 3hp lp swc and dyr table 4 with the widest area with high cc over 0 8 and low rmse below 1 5 fig 7a f according to fig 7g l qpe based pdsis apparently have better capability for drought detection than those of spi3 shown in fig 1e h with higher pod and lower far in the east china three qpe based pdsis present high pod mainly above 0 7 indicating that more than 70 of drought events were caught by the qpes referring to fig 1e h similar regional differences between the qpes can also be found in fig 7g l as pdsi of 3b42v7 and chirps presents higher pod than persiann cdr in southwest china in summary three qpes perform well in the eastern part of china when using pdsi 3b42v7 presents best performance with higher accuracy in many cases 3 3 case studies of typical drought affected regions to further temporally and spatially evaluate the drought indices estimated from all three qpes four typical drought affected regions are selected from the nine agricultural regions for regional specific case studies including northeast china nec huang huai hai plain 3hp southwest china swc and loess plateau lp the 3hp and swc are selected to analyze two typical drought events i e the continuous drought of 1999 2000 in north china wei et al 2004 and the severe drought of 2009 2010 in southwest china barriopedro et al 2012 zhang et al 2013a b the nec is selected due to a major grain producing region of china the lp is selected for its fragile environment sensitive to drought zhang et al 2013b 2016 and it could also represent the performance of the qpes in the semi arid areas the drought events from jan 2001 to jan 2002 in nec and from sep 1999 to sep 2000 in lp are selected as typical drought events for nec and lp respectively the agricultural regions of west china are not considered because of the sparse and uneven distributed gauge network additionally we did not consider the meteorological drought for the arid areas like the northwest china xu et al 2015 for a brief only the 3 month spi spi3 that is more capable to reveal seasonal drought xu et al 2015 was selected as a represent case for the following regional evaluations time series of regional averaged spi3 and fractional drought area based on persiann cdr and chirps for the four regions are shown in fig 8 ccs and rmses of the regional averaged spi3 are listed in table 5 both persiann cdr and chirps are able to accurately detect typical drought events of all four regions as their spi3 could catch the start and end of the drought events although some biases were found in drought intensity estimates fig 8 for the four regions nec 3hp swc and lp spi3 of both qpes fit well with in situ observations fig 8 for lp agreement between the qpes and in situ observations is poorest but the qpes can still identify the drought events fig 8d h and the ccs are still high persiann cdr outperforms chirps for the four regions for temporal correlation but their differences are small table 5 spatial patterns of the spi3 in the specific month of the typical drought events for the four regions are shown in fig 9 the drought intensity was roughly reflected by both persiann cdr and chirps persiann cdr could not accurately match the spatial pattern of the typical drought events for the four regions especially for 3hp and swc although it performs satisfactorily for the temporal evaluation above in comparison chirps picks up the spatial centers and extent of the typical drought events relatively accurately although some underestimates of drought intensity are found spatial ccs of the qpes against in situ observations for the four typical drought events are listed in table 5 among the four regions both qpes present the highest spatial correlation in 3hp ccs of nearly 0 8 while the poorest correlation is found in lp ccs of 0 344 to 0 537 we then evaluated and compared the performance of the qpes in pdsi estimating including 3b42v7 fig 10 presents the time series of regional averaged pdsi and the fractional drought area based on pdsi for the three qpes qpes fit well with in situ observations when using pdsi and their correlations with in situ observations are even better than when using spi3 drought events for the four regions were all accurately caught by all three qpes among the qpes 3b42v7 performed the best with the least deviation in the estimates of drought severity in comparison some apparent underestimates and overestimates can be found in both persiann cdr and chirps estimates fig 10 table 5 also lists the temporal ccs of the qpe based pdsi for the four regions 3b42v7 presents the best agreement with in situ observations in pdsi estimation as it features the highest ccs and lowest rmses for all four regions discrepancies between persiann cdr and chirps of pdsi are similar with those of spi3 as persiann cdr performs slightly better than chirps for the four regions similar to fig 9 spatial maps of the pdsi in the specific month of the typical drought events are also shown in fig 11 apparently spatial consistencies of persiann cdr and chirps are also mostly improved when spi3 is replaced by pdsi especially for nec and swc but except for 3hp all the three qpes caught the spatial centers and extent of the drought events for the four regions persiann cdr still generally presents the poorest spatial correlation with in situ data table 5 and shows the poorest skill to match the spatial pattern of drought when using pdsi fig 11 but the gap with other qpes is apparently reduced especially in swc among the four regions the spatial correlation of the qpe drived pdsi is poorest in lp but it is still acceptable 4 discussion 4 1 validation of the gb t based pdsi the gb t 20481 2006 national standard zhang et al 2006 provides a modified pdsi calculation procedure that considers the climate characteristic of china to rationalize and simplify pdsi calculation in china however few studies focused on the reliability of the gb t procedure when using qpe data therefore it is necessary to verify the capability of the gb t procedure for the calculation with satellite qpe data in the present study according to fig 12 distributions of the different pdsi based drought classifications of both in situ data and qpes are generally reasonable for both the whole mainland china and the four regions fig 12 specifically the frequencies of normal spell 1 p d s i 1 mainly ranged from 0 35 to 0 40 while frequencies of extreme drought spell p d s i 4 are nearly 0 025 which is similar to normal distribution and roughly meets the aim of the self calibrating procedure proposed by wells et al 2014 please note that frequencies of extreme wet spell p d s i 4 are a little overestimated for some regions fig 12a b d however their impact on drought monitoring could be ignored distributions of the drought classifications of the regions except nec are similar with those of the whole mainland china while nec relatively underestimates the frequency of normal spell nearly 0 30 but is still acceptable fig 12a therefore we suggest that the gb t based pdsi has satisfactory adaptability and spatial comparability for mainland china and is reasonable for the qpe based pdsi calculation in the present study moreover although the pdsi of gb t has considered the climate characteristic of china several local climatic components are also included hence reliability of pdsi might also be impacted by the length of the data records therefore the reasonability of using short term qpe data to calculate the pdsi in the present study also requires verification we additionally calculated the gb t based pdsi with longer in situ observation records of 1983 2015 33 a with 3hp and swc as example we compared the pdsi temporally and spatially based on the 33 a and 18 a 1998 2015 same as 3b42v7 of in situ data and 3b42v7 data of 1998 2015 18 a fig 13 apparently high temporal consistency between the pdsi derived from 33 a and 18 a in situ data can be found as their time series nearly coincided especially in 3hp fig 13a b spatially the pdsi of 18 a in situ data accurately match the spatial pattern of the typical drought in the both regions shown by the pdsi of 33 a data fig 13c d e f fig 13 also shows that 3b42v7 based pdsi presents a high temporal and spatial correlation with in situ data of both 33 a and 18 a this shows that the short term qpes e g 3b42v7 also have great potential for drought monitoring when using the gb t pdsi in mainland china sahoo et al 2015 also performed a similar validation on the spi calculated via long term 31 a and short term 10 a data records respectively they also found that the length of data records presents little impact on the spi calculation and supposed that it might be because both normal and extreme events are included in the period of data record as both several severe drought and flood disasters have taken placed during the past two decades in china piao et al 2010 might also explain our findings as a result we suggest that the evaluation in the present study using the precipitation data with 18 a records for pdsi is reasonable 4 2 comparison of the usability of the satellite qpes in drought monitoring according to the results above temporally all three qpes generally performed well for drought detection in the eastern part of china even including the southwest and mid west area of china although persiann cdr presents superior performance in several regions chirps also performs satisfactorily in where persiann cdr performs well comparability of chirps to persiann cdr also can be found in the humid and semi arid area of other countries dembélé and zwart 2016 zambrano et al 2016 hence both persiann cdr and chirps are capable to be used for regional drought monitoring and even have great potential to substitute the in situ gauge observations in these areas however persiann cdr is relatively weak in revealing spatial patterns of drought events since persiann cdr is corrected by the gridded gpcp data ashouri et al 2014 while chirps and 3b42v7 are corrected by the station data the coarse spatial resolution 2 5 of gpcp might be a reason of the poorer spatial performance as a result caution should be taken when studying the spatial characteristics of drought with persiann cdr 3b42v7 performs superior than the other two qpes over the east of china and its drought utility has also been validated in other studies sahoo et al 2015 zeng et al 2012 however due to its short data records stability and reasonability of 3b42v7 for drought monitoring or other climatic applications it might need further evaluation as there are still only few case studies specifically we evaluated the 3b42v7 via only pdsi in mainland china nevertheless 3b42v7 also shows considerable potential for drought monitoring for west china large differences between the qpes and in situ data are found not only in the present study but also in the studies of tang et al 2016 guo et al 2016 and shen and xiong 2016 which pointed out that the sparse gauge networks in west china largely limit the evaluation of qpes we believe the large differences might be induced by the low quality of the qpes caused by the dry climate special land surface and lack of in situ error correction gao and liu 2013 sahoo et al 2015 guo et al 2016 similar to shen and xiong 2016 here we further explored the accuracy of the qpes for the two gauge sparse regions of west china i e nwc and tp by only evaluating the gauged gridcells for the two regions distributions of the cc and bias of the qpes for the two regions at all or only gauged gridcells are shown by the quantiles in table 6 low cc values 5 and 25 quantile of the three qpes are apparently higher for the gauged gridcells than the all gridcells for both nwc and tp and in some cases ranges of bias are smaller for the gauged gridcells e g tp less change of the high cc values 75 and 95 quantile indicates that the gridcells with higher accuracy of qpes are mainly located with gauges however compared with the regions in east china ccs are generally still low and the ranges of bias are still large for nwc and tp even only the gauged gridcells are evaluated as the medians 50 quantile of ccs for nwc are even below 0 8 and biases are ranging from down to 50 to up to 140 for both nwc and tp for the three qpes this might also reveal the inherent poor accuracy for the qpes indicating the unsuitability of the qpes for drought monitoring over these areas denser gauge networks might also be an important reason for the higher accuracy of the qpes as they could obtain better bias correction in these areas which was also mentioned by sahoo et al 2015 especially for chirps and 3b42v7 in all we suggest that the large differences between the qpes and in situ data in the west china are induced by both the sparse gauge networks and the low accuracy of the qpes therefore the performance of the three qpes in west china may be beyond acceptable limits and then the current qpes are not recommended for drought monitoring further evaluation and correction of the qpes using local gauge observations for these areas would be necessary for further works although the present study evaluates three qpes only in mainland china we hope that our results can be used as reference for other regions around the world in a global evaluation sahoo et al 2015 reported that post process 3b42 products present high agreement with non tmpa products than the near real time one without in situ correction in the regions with dense gauge networks e g the eastern usa eastern south america southern africa india south eastern asia and australia those findings are similar with our findings and discussion above and reveal the importance of the in situ bias correction for the qpes significant improvements of the accuracy of near real time qpes after in situ correction have also been validated by aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 and vernimmen et al 2012 for global and regional scales respectively in all we expect that the qpes might also perform similarly in the areas discussed by former studies above at present we have confirmed the utility of the three qpes for the retrospective drought assessment however usability of the qpes for the real time or near real time drought applications is also important and thus needs discussion it takes quite a long time to process and obtain the in situ observations for error correction and thus some days are required before the release of the global scale data of chirps and 3b42v7 therefore these two qpes may be unsuitable for the strict real time applications however since drought is a long term phenomenon with much larger timescale than flood and rain storm the latency of data release of the two qpes might be acceptable for the near real time drought monitoring the lag time of persiann cdr is longer usually several months later as this qpe mainly aims at the researches of historical climate ashouri et al 2014 and therefore the persiann cdr might be only suitable for the retrospective historical drought assessment some efforts have been made to develop the real time or near real time long term qpes with higher timeliness by combining the short term near real time qpes and long term qpes e g gpcp aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 developed a near real time qpe by combining the near real time 3b42rt and persiann products and the long term gpcp product but the spatial resolution of up to 0 5 might not meet the requirement of local drought monitoring aadhar and mishra 2017 also developed a near real time qpe with high quality and spatial resolution up to 0 05 while it is only specific for south asia accordingly the global or semi global scale high spatial resolution long term real time qpes still require further development above all for most of the eastern part of china long term persiann cdr and chirps perform satisfactorily and are suitable for drought utilities in which chirps could also be applied for near real time drought monitoring the short term qpe 3b42v7 also shows great potential for drought monitoring for west china the qpes are not suitable for drought monitoring in these areas 5 conclusions this study mainly evaluated and compared the drought monitoring utilities of the two long term satellite qpes i e persiann cdr since 1983 and chirps since 1981 and a short term qpe i e tmpa 3b42v7 since 1998 over mainland china cgdpa a gridded precipitation dataset generated from the dense rain gauge networks in mainland china was used as in situ observations to evaluate the qpes both the spi and the pdsi the two most widely used meteorological drought indices were selected as examples to verify the drought utility of the qpes a three qpes generally show high monthly accuracy in east china with high correlation with in situ observations and little bias but the accuracy for west china could not be clearly ensured due to the sparse in situ gauge networks underestimations of high precipitation normally exist in the qpes while different types of bias over or underestimations of mid and low precipitation are found for the qpes b for the evaluation with spi with reference to in situ observations spi of both persiann cdr and chirps present similar spatial patterns with high correlation in east part of mainland china while low correlation in west china e g nwc and tp as the timescale of spi increases accuracy of qpe based spis consistently increase or decreases for different regions with regard to the evaluation with pdsi spatial patterns and discrepancies of the qpes are similar with those of spi3 3b42v7 presents the best performance among the three qpes with higher cc and pod in many cases c temporally when using spi with spi3 as example both persiann cdr and chirps are able to catch the typical drought events for the four agricultural regions i e northeast china nec huang huai hai plain 3hp southwest china swc and loess plateau lp however the persiann cdr is relatively weak in matching the spatial pattern of the typical drought events while chirps could accurately catch the spatial extent and centers of drought events d when turned to pdsi persiann cdr still has the poorest spatial performance for detecting typical drought events 3b42v7 drived pdsi features the best temporal performance among all three qpes with least deviation from the in situ data and performs comparably with chirps in detecting the spatial pattern of typical drought events in summary the long term persiann cdr and chirps are suitable for drought monitoring in the eastern part of mainland china regardless of whether spi or pdsi are used however caution should be applied when using persiann cdr to study the spatial variation of drought the short term 3b42v7 product also performed satisfactorily in drought detection when using pdsi presenting considerable potential for drought monitoring however for west china all three qpes perform unacceptably indicating the unsuitability of the qpes for drought monitoring in these areas acknowledgements

6819,carbonate weathering by co2 is considered to play an important role in the global carbon cycle in acid rain affected areas the carbon cycle can be impacted by acid rain weathering when previous studies have considered all possible weathering processes including h2so4 in rainfall sulfide oxidation and agricultural activities this study proposed a geochemical method to specifically calculate the extent of carbonate weathering by acid rain using hydrogeochemical data from karstic spring and rainfall this method has considered the h concentration and nitrification of nh4 in rain during recharge and provided the upper limit of the weathering amount seasonal sampling for spring wet and dry season was conducted from a typical carbonate area in jiaoshi chongqing sw china with annual rain ph values ranging from 3 94 to 4 70 the major hydrogeochemistry types of spring are hco3 ca and hco3 ca mg the average proportion of carbonate weathering by acid rain is estimated to be 36 15 the

hartmann et al 2014 chen et al 2017 while carbonate weathering plays an important role in the carbon sink liu et al 2010 many factors could affect its rates since the beginning of the twentieth

carbonic acid impact on the carbonate dissolution is considered lerman et al 2007 had predicted that the h2so4 to the continental surface produced by anthropogenic emissions of so2 would be 5 times greater than the natural h2so4 production by the oxidation of pyrite in sediments from pre industrial value oxidation of pyrite to the year 2015 100 mt s yr globally which would increase the total

balancing cation for the so4 and no3 van breemen et al 1982 lerman et al 2007 like rainfall in north china xu et al 2012 zhai et al 2013 and in sw china zhang et al 2012 eanet 2017 the nitrification of nh4 can release protons h and contribute to additional carbonate dissolution van breemen et al 1982 etchanchu and probst 1988 appelo and postma 2005 however most studies have focused on the impact of nitrification of n fertilizers on carbonate dissolution etchanchu and probst 1988 semhi et al 2000 perrin et al 2008 jiang 2013 the aim of this study is to use chemical data of rainfall to systematically calculate carbonate weathering by acid rain of all types of acid during recharge in the area of interest the results would have important implications for the assessment of the carbon cycle and hydrogeochemical processes in acid rain affected areas 2 study area the study area of jiaoshi is located in the middle of chongqing city parallel to the province sw china fig 1 the area of chongqing city is approximately 82 400 km2 and carbonate rocks cover approximately 30 000 km2 karst spring is the most abundant source of water supplying 73 of total groundwater resources pu et al 2014 the area represents a transitional zone between the tibetan plateau and the middle to lower reaches of the yangtze river alluvial plain and is dominated by hilly topography various rivers belonging to the yangtze river system flow through the area conditions are typical of a subtropical humid monsoon climate with a high average annual temperature of 16 18 c the annual average precipitation is 1000 1200 mm and 62 of the total precipitation occurs in may september during rainstorms ni et al 2017 the lithologies of the shallow groundwater aquifer in the study area jiaoshi are light gray and gray limestone and dolomite of lower triassic age t1 j fig 1 lyu et al 2012 huang et al 2017 based on the jy1 borehole fig 1 the thickness of the lower triassic jianglingjiang group t1 j is 277 m the feixianguan group t1 f is 426 m the upper permian group p2 is 226 m and the lower permian group p1 is 474 m respectively the elevation mainly ranges from 400 to 800 m and dissecting depth ranges from 50 to 150 m lyu et al 2012 underground rivers and springs develop with depth less than 150 m lyu et al 2012 li 2014 the shallow groundwater outcrops in the term of springs there are almost no wells in the area discharge from large springs and underground rivers in the study area ranges from 100 l s to 1000 l s and the runoff modulus is more than 6 l s km2 although the type of lithology in the shallow aquifer is simple the anisotropy is strong enough to result in the heterogeneous occurrences of groundwater and cave springs in this area the study area is a mountainous area with little arable land the population is relatively sparse 180 pop km2 in 2011 based on the local statistical yearbook some springs are used for distributed domestic water supply one or more families use one spring sewage water has not been treated but drained to the watershed directly the amount of sewage is limited compared to total runoff 1 there are few industrial activities in this area chongqing has been suffered from air pollution and acid rain for a long time the annual average ph value from 1993 to 2007 ranged from 3 8 to 4 5 in the urban area he et al 2009 based on acid deposition monitoring network in east asia eanet 2017 the weighted annual average ph of precipitation from 2002 to 2015 in jinyunshan beibei district chongqing about 100 km far away from the study area fig 1 range from 3 94 to 4 70 with an average value of 4 35 the site represents a rural district that is less impacted by anthropogenic activities than those in urban areas which is similar to the study area in addition these areas are all affected by acid rain in the similar pattern mep 2016 therefore the rainfall in beibei is used to represent the precipitation chemical characteristics of the study area 3 sampling and analysis a total of 64 spring samples were collected in the jiaoshi in 2016 36 water samples in the rainy season may june and 28 samples in the dry season october november two sewage waters were also sampled for end member identification in addition 10 surface carbonate rock samples representing the lithology of the aquifer were obtained and analyzed for mineral and isotopic composition δ13c and δ18o for carbonate the locations of the spring and rock samples are shown in fig 1 physical and chemical parameters such as ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ using a multi parameter device hach hq40d all of the water samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane and stored in polypropylene bottles before analysis samples used for cation analysis were immediately acidified with distilled hno3 1 mol l to a ph of less than 2 all samples were preserved in a dark refrigerator at 4 c before laboratory analysis water chemistry analyses were performed in the beijing research institute of uranium geology briug beijing china anions f cl so4 and no3 were measured with a dionex 500 ion chromatograph with detection

optima2x00 1500 with a detection limit of 0 05 mg l nh4 and no2 was measured using an ultraviolet visible spectroscopy based on the methods of gb t 5750 6 with detection limit of 0 02 mg l and 0 002 mg l stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h were measured using a laser absorption water isotope analyzer picarro l1102 i in the institute of geology and geophysics chinese academy of sciences igg cas beijing china the results are reported as δ2h and δ18o δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 using the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as the standard the analytical precision of the δ18o and δ2h measurements for the water samples are 0 1 and 0 5 respectively the δ13c and δ18o of the carbonate rock samples the lithology of shallow aquifer and δ13c dic of spring were analyzed using a mat 253 mass spectrometer at the igg cas with a standard deviation of 0 1 mineral composition of the rock samples were measured using a panalytical x pert pro in the igg cas 4 results 4 1 aquifer mineral and isotopic characteristics the mineral components of the rock samples are shown in table 1 the aquifer lithologies are free of feldspar and clay minerals and are mainly composed of calcite dolomite and very limited quartz with the exception of three samples dominated by dolomite calcite is the primary rock component the δ13c and δ18o values of carbonate were measured for the selected samples table 1 the isotopic compositions for carbonates range from 1 8 to 1 2 with an average of 1 5 for δ13c and from 6 6 to 7 0 with an average of 6 8 for δ18o the values are slightly more negative compared with the average value for marine carbonate δ13c of 0 and δ18o of 0 but consistent with the regional measurements of t1 j stratum huang et al 2016 4 2 water chemistry of rainfall based on the acid deposition monitoring network in jinyunshan beibei district chongqing from 2002 to 2015 eanet 2017 the ph values range from 3 94 to 4 70 with an average value of 4 35 table 2 the main cations as meq l are ca 39 nh4 35 and h 17 while the main anions are so4 78 and no3 18 fig 2 those values are consistent with other observations in the sw china such as guilin from 2009 01 to 2010 12 with average ph of 4 83 zhang et al 2012 and guiyang 1 from 1999 01 to 2001 10 with average ph of 4 63 han and liu 2006 2 from 2005 09 to 2010 08 with average ph of 4 43 luo et al 2013 and 3 from 2008 10 to 2009 09 with average ph of 4 23 xiao et al 2010 the nh4 contents in precipitation from 2002 to 2015 range from 1 126 mg l to 2 234 mg l with a weighted average value of 1 722 mg l table 2 close to the value of 1 65 mg l in guilin from 2009 01 to 2010 12 zhang et al 2012 and 2 03 mg l in guiyang from 2008 10 to 2009 09 xiao et al 2010 the weighted average no3 content in precipitation is 2 8 mg l 4 3 water chemistry and isotopic composition of springs the data for major ions ph and stable isotope values of spring water in wet and dry season are shown in table 3 in the rainy season the ph values of spring water range from 7 4 to 8 6 with an average of 7 9 all neutral to slightly alkaline the total dissolved solids tds values range from 146 mg l to 357 mg l with an average value of 257 mg l the ph values of spring water in dry season range from 7 1 to 8 1 with an average value of 7 6 and tds values range from 158 to 414 mg l with an average value of 283 mg l which is slightly higher than that in rainy season the main anions of the spring water samples for both the rainy season and dry season are hco3 followed by so4 the hco3 and so4 contents in the shallow spring range from 118 mg l to 375 mg l and from 11 mg l to 58 mg l respectively taking the milligram equivalent concentration meq l ratio of 59 93 and 5 31 for total anions the main cation constituents are ca and mg with concentration of 43 130 mg l and 2 9 40 mg l respectively accounting for 57 95 and 5 43 for total cations based on the piper diagram fig 3 ca is the dominant cation in the spring samples 50 in meq l while hco3 is the dominant anion 50 in meq l the water types are divided into three kinds namely hco3 ca type hco3 so4 ca type and hco3 ca mg type the hco3 ca type is dominated by the hydrochemical type during the rainy season the na and cl contents are relatively low ranging from 0 3 mg l to 21 mg l and from 0 9 mg l to 29 mg l respectively in the dry season the na and cl contents of spring samples range from 0 6 mg l to 15 mg l and from 2 5 mg l to 32 mg l respectively the average value for na and cl is 2 1 mg l and 5 2 mg l respectively nh4 and no2 has not been detected in any spring water samples the nh4 in precipitation may be nitrified to no3 during recharge and then the no3 can be consumed by plants van breemen et al 1982 shen et al 1993 appelo and postma 2005 since the vegetation is dense in the area the no3 of spring water samples concentrations range from 0 1 mg l to 71 mg l with an average of 13 0 mg l and a median value of 8 8 mg l the δ18o and δ2h values 36 samples range from 3 8 to 7 0 and from 17 1 to 43 7 respectively in the wet season table 3 as shown in fig 4 all shallow spring samples lie close to the local meteoric water line lmwl of δ2h 8 73δ18o 15 73 li et al 2010 obtained from the beibei district precipitation station but deviate from the global meteoric water line gmwl of δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 this indicates that spring waters are recharged by local precipitation in the region without significant evaporation the tritium 6 5 8 6 tu and 14c 95 4 98 6 pmc contents suggest that all springs in the study area is modern li et al 2016 the spring samples in the dry season 7 samples suffer from slight evaporation compared with those of the wet season fig 4 a common meteoric origin shows that all of the geochemical modifications were induced from water rock interactions in the shallow aquifers the δ13c dic of spring water ranges narrowly from 12 5 to 11 0 with an average value of 11 6 4 4 origin of hydrochemical constituents chloride behaves conservatively in the hydrological cycle ma et al 2003 but it can be introduced by rainfall recharge human activities such as domestic sewage and fertilizers and mineral dissolution of evaporites in a catchment in this study area there are no evaporites in the shallow groundwater aquifer according to systematic rainfall monitoring data eanet 2017 and spring water chemistry the na cl of precipitation the symbol of represents meq l in the text and spring samples is almost the same approximately 0 6 fig 5 a suggesting that the origin of the springs is from local meteoric water or other sources with similar ratio the na cl ratios of sewage waters locate on the fit line of precipitation all shallow spring samples have higher na and cl contents than the rain samples which suggests that the spring water experienced concentration by transpiration no evaporation concentration because stable isotopic results show no evaporation signal and may be influenced by human activities such as the utilization of fertilizers and mixing with sewage waters the so4 cl ratios of spring are different from those of rain spring water is enriched in cl compared with rainfall fig 5b because so4 and cl are all conservative tracers in shallow system the relatively enriched cl suggests additional cl input to groundwater system in the study area mixing with distributed sewage water and utilization of fertilizers are the two possible reasons fig 5c shows that the latter may be the dominant factor controlling spring cl and no3 because their concentrations increase simultaneously sewage waters have relatively high cl concentrations but similar so4 concentration of spring fig 5b when the no3 concentrations of spring increase the so4 concentrations do not covary but always vary in a large range fig 5d while the average nh4 contents in rainfall is 1 722 mg l it has not detected in any spring samples 0 02 mg l as spring waters are recharged by rainfall the phenomenon could be attributed to the nitrification of ammonia by autotrophic bacteria during recharge processes van breemen et al 1982 etchanchu and probst 1988 semhi et al 2000 appelo and postma 2005 1 nh 4 2 o 2 2 h no 3 h 2 o two protons worth of acidity are produced for every ammonium ion that is oxidized so this process tends to make the environment more acidic howarth 2002 therefore both the h in rainfall and the h produced by ammonium nitrification during recharge can weather the carbonate rocks and provide additional ca mg and hco3 in spring waters 4 5 proportion of carbonate dissolution by acid rain spring waters are only recharged by rainfall in the study area the direct chemical input and rainfall weathering can be identified the total nh4 in rainfall are assumed to be all nitrified in this oxidizing environment based on chemical composition of rainfall fig 2 the total h would be 0 87 0 17 of rainfall itself and 2 times of nh4 as 1 meq l h can produce 1 meq l hco3 and 2 meq l ca mg when weathering carbonate 2 h ca x mg 1 x co 3 xca 1 x mg hco 3 the hco3 would be 0 87 and the total ca mg would be 2 16 0 42 of rainfall itself and 2 times of total h the proportion of so4 in rainfall is 0 78 therefore the direct rainfall input and rainfall weathering of carbonate would result in ca mg hco3 of 2 48 and so4 hco3 of 0 90 fig 6 however the carbonate weathering purely by soil co2 3 co 2 h 2 o ca x mg 1 x co 3 xca 1 x mg 2hco 3 would result in ca mg hco3 of 1 and so4 hco3 of 0 fig 6 shows that spring waters locate in the range between the two end members 1 carbonate weathering by soil co2 weathering and 2 rainfall input weathering because the shallow aquifer is composed of relatively pure carbonate rocks the dissolution of carbonates by co2 and acid rain may be the main source of dic spring ca mg so4 and hco3 are mainly from 1 rainfall deposition subscript by r and then concentrated by transpiration and limited evaporation subscript by rc 2 weathering carbonate by concentrated acid rain subscript by rw and 3 weathering carbonate by soil co2 subscript by cw 4 ca mg r so 4 r h r nh 4 r ca mg rc so 4 rc h rc nh 4 rc 5 h rc ca x mg 1 x co 3

l ca mg rw1 and 1 meq l hco3 rw1 in eq 6 1 meq l nh4 rc can produce 4 meq l ca mg rw2 and 2 meq l hco3 rw2 while in eq 7 the meq l ratio of ca mg cw and hco3 cw is 1 if the rainfall deposition enrichment factor f is known then spring ca mg rc from direct input of rainfall can be calculated by multiplying ca mg in rainfall by f the ca mg rw1 hco3 rw1 ca mg rw2 and hco3 rw2 can also be calculated by the content of h rc and nh4 rc notably while ions such as ca mg cl no3 and so4 would be concentrated by the enrichment factor f h rc and nh4 rc represent constant weathering though the expression is labeled in the same way there are little sulfate such as gypsum or sulfur minerals such as pyrite fes2 in the shallow aquifer of t1 j carbonate although in the deep aquifer with well depth up to 2160 m there may be gypsum or anhydrite embedded in the t1 j carbonate where there are geothermal water with estimated reservoir temperature of more than 60 c yang et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 this is a reasonable assumption for shallow aquifer because even though there were sulfur minerals in the shallow aquifer the relatively quick water cycle has taken those minerals out of the watershed allison and hughes 1978 the average value of so4 so4 hco3 co3 cl no3 in the study area is 14 significantly lower than values 24 29 in the areas affected by sulfide oxidation in sw china liu et al 2008 in the study area the springs are all modern water recharged since the 1950s li et al 2016 meanwhile the so4 concentration in sewage water is similar to that in spring which does not alter the concentration of so4 in spring in addition the amount of the sewage water is very limited in this mountainous area with few inhabitants distributed population if spring so4 is only derived from precipitation which is a reasonable assumption in the study area the enrichment factor f of rainfall to spring can be obtained by dividing so4 in spring by so4 in rainfall scanlon et al 2010 lin et al 2013 the weighted average so4 content in rainfall was 9 55 mg l from 2002 to 2015 table 2 the enrichment factor ranges from 1 2 to 4 9 with an average value of 3 5 in the rainy season and ranges from 2 1 to 6 1 with an average of 3 8 in the dry season when f is obtained for each spring sample then the ca mg from rain deposition ca mg rc f ca mg r and from weathering carbonate by acid rain h rc f h r nh4 rc f nh4 r can be obtained the weathering proportion r by acid rain can be determined by dividing the ca mg weathered from rainfall h rc ca mg rw1 and from nitrification of nh4 rc ca mg rw2 by the total ca mg in spring ca mg t subtracting the direct rain input ca mg rc 8 r c a m g r w 1 c a m g r w 2 c a m g t c a m g rc the results table 4 show that the contribution to carbonate dissolution by acid rain h nh4 ranges from 12 to 58 with an average value of 35 for the rainy season and from 18 to 59 with an average value of 37 for the dry season the average value for the rainy and dry seasons is approximately 36 the error is from the deviation of so4 and h nh4 content in rainfall as the so4 has a standard deviation σ of 3 04 mg l 31 and h nh4 of 29 in precipitation those deviations would result in a total deviation of 43 when considering the variation of so4 content in precipitation the range from 6 51 to 12 59 mg l overlaps the observed value of 8 38 mg l in guilin zhang et al 2012 and 9 02 12 75 mg l in guiyang han and liu 2006 xiao et al 2010 consequently the average proportion of carbonate dissolution by acid rain of would be 36 15 when error is considered 5 discussion when the ca mg from rainfall direct input i e ca mg rc and ca mg from rainfall h nh4 weathering i e ca mg cw1 cw2 is subtracted from spring ca mg i e ca mg t and hco3 from rainfall h nh4 weathering i e hco3 cw1 cw2 is subtracted from spring hco3 i e hco3 t the residual ca mg t rc rw1 rw2 and hco3 t rw1 rw2 can be roughly considered as co2 weathering process which lies around the line of 1 1 of ca mg hco3 fig 7 suggesting the calculation is reasonable as the carbon in hco3 cw1 cw2 is only from carbonate caxmg1 xco3 the δ13c hco3 cw1 cw2 should be equal to the δ13c caxmg1 xco3 of 1 5 eqs 5 and 6 table 1 the residual hco3 is from co2 weathering of carbonate and half carbon of hco3 is from co2 aq δ13c of 24 1 for dissolved co2 aq for c3 vegetation δ13c for soil gas is 23 under temperature of 10 25 c clark and fritz 1997 and the other half is from caxmg1 xco3 δ13c of 1 5 eq 7 resulting in δ13c hco3 of 12 8 the saturation indexes of calcite si c calculated using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 are all larger than 0 from 0 03 to 1 25 with average of 0 62 table 4 which indicates that calcite levels are over saturated in spring waters based on the result from table 4 the δ13c hco3 in spring can be calculated because the ph of spring waters ranges from 7 1 to 8 6 the hco3 dominates the dic shen et al 1993 appelo and postma 2005 table 5 shows that most of the measured δ13c dic values are more depleted than calculated δ13c hco3 the spring pco2 calculated using phreeqc ranges from 2455 to 6607 ppmv note pco2 of 360 ppmv for atmosphere and 3 000 30 000 ppmv for soil gas suggesting δ13c dic may have isotopic exchange in this open karst groundwater system telmer and veizer 1999 and the complete equilibrium between hco3 and co2 g would result in δ13c hco3 ranging from 15 7 to 14 3 at temperature of 18 31 c for spring waters mook et al 1974 clark and fritz 1997 the proportion calculated from rainfall data in this study stands for the upper limit of the contribution of rainfall weathering on carbonate rock firstly the enrichment factor f is obtained by assuming the spring so4 are all from rainfall although it is a reasonable assumption in the study area f stands for the upper limit if there is additional so4 in spring waters e g caso4 dissolution fes2 oxidation fertilization secondly the nh4 in rainfall are considered to be all nitrified during recharge processes if the method from huang et al 2015 is used which assumed that the weathering from acid rainfall is in the form of h2so4 dissolution and the excess of ca mg over hco3 in spring water are all contribution by h2so4 dissolution the average proportion in the study area would be 55 significantly larger than the result 36 based on the rainfall data because the chemical composition of rainfall is not only h2so4 but mainly caso4 and nh4so4 fig 2 and their method is based on groundwater river itself it has therefore overestimated the weathering contribution of acid rainfall based on the characteristics of acid rain table 2 and fig 2 the contribution of nh4 nitrification is about 4 times higher than that from direct acidity of rainfall the average contribution of nh4 nitrification in precipitation during recharge to the total carbonate weathering is 29 in the study area which is comparable to the value of 12 26 in the garonne basin france dominated by carbonate rocks semhi et al 2000 however the nh4 for the garonne basin is derived from n fertilizer spreading the fore mentioned all suggests that the significant contribution of acid rain with high concentration of nh4 on carbonate weathering and further affects the co2 budget 6 conclusions this study provides a quantitative geochemical method to estimate the impact of acid rain on the carbonate weathering using hydrogeochemical data of rainfall it represents the upper limit of the contribution from rainfall h nh4 weathering in the jiaoshi watershed the average contribution ratio from acid rain weathering to the total carbonate weathering is 36 15 the value is less than the result obtained from the previous method which assumed that the so4 in acid rain is all in the form of h2so4 or so4 in groundwater is all from h2so4 weathering this study is helpful in understanding the hydrogeochemical processes in acid rain areas and in calculating co2 sources sinks of carbonate weathering

6819,carbonate weathering by co2 is considered to play an important role in the global carbon cycle in acid rain affected areas the carbon cycle can be impacted by acid rain weathering when previous studies have considered all possible weathering processes including h2so4 in rainfall sulfide oxidation and agricultural activities this study proposed a geochemical method to specifically calculate the extent of carbonate weathering by acid rain using hydrogeochemical data from karstic spring and rainfall this method has considered the h concentration and nitrification of nh4 in rain during recharge and provided the upper limit of the weathering amount seasonal sampling for spring wet and dry season was conducted from a typical carbonate area in jiaoshi chongqing sw china with annual rain ph values ranging from 3 94 to 4 70 the major hydrogeochemistry types of spring are hco3 ca and hco3 ca mg the average proportion of carbonate weathering by acid rain is estimated to be 36 15 the quantitative geochemical method provided in this study is important for understanding the hydrogeochemical processes in acid rain areas and for calculating co2 sources sinks of carbonate weathering keywords acid rain karst spring hydrogeochemical characteristics dissolved inorganic carbon isotopes 1 introduction chemical weathering of crustal rocks contributes to the chemical and climatic

free land is about 22 million km2 14 7 in earth ice free land ford and williams 2007 chen et al 2017 approximately 20 25 of the world s population depends largely or entirely on groundwater obtained from karst aquifers and in some countries and regions such as austria the dinaric region europe and sw china karst water contributes more than 50 to regional freshwater supplies ford and williams 2007 hartmann et al 2014 chen et al 2017 while carbonate weathering plays an important role in the carbon sink liu et al 2010 many factors could affect its rates since the beginning of the twentieth century the atmospheric concentration of acidifying gases such as so2 nox and nh3 which result from industrial activity coal burning and other activities increased steadily moncoulon et al 2004 majer et al 2005 oulehle et al 2016 consequently there were large amounts of atmospheric acid deposition in the areas of europe north america and sw china sulphur release had decreased since the 1980s since the 1990s most acidified streams and lakes in north america and europe have experienced chemical relief garmo et al 2014 in the last 40 years china has suffered from varying degrees of acid rain rainfall with ph value lower than 5 6 is defined as acid rain and the southwest part has been seriously impacted wang et al 1993 li 1999 eanet 2017 at present in terms of area china s strong acid rain zone ph 4 5 is much larger than those in europe the united states and other asian areas zhang et al 2010 based on the china environmental status bulletin in 2015 released by the ministry of environmental protection mep 2016 40 4 among 474 cities occur acid rainfall and 32 cities have rainfall with annual average ph lower than 5 6 overall the type of acid rain is the sulfuric acid type and acid rain pollution is mainly distributed in the south of the yangtze river and the east of the yunnan guizhou plateau in acid rain affected areas an amplified result will be obtained if only the carbonic acid impact on the carbonate dissolution is considered lerman et al 2007 had predicted that the h2so4 to the continental surface produced by anthropogenic emissions of so2 would be 5 times greater than the natural h2so4 production by the oxidation of pyrite in sediments from pre industrial value oxidation of pyrite to the year 2015 100 mt s yr globally which would increase the total concentration of dissolved ionic solids by 13 in pre industrial time co2 and to a lesser extent h2so4 from pyrite oxidation are the two main acids in continental weathering worldwide lerman et al 2007 however weathering carbonate rock from sulfuric acid can take significant part in the total weathering in some specific areas liu et al 2008 xu and liu 2010 previous studies have shown the significance of the contribution of sulfide oxidation 6 30 to the chemical loads in the ganga brahmaputra and yamuna rivers in the himalayas galy and france lanord 1999 and in western and northern canadian river systems gaillardet et al 2003 millot et al 2003 based on chemical mass balance 25 of the total weathering cation flux can be attributed to carbonate and silicate dissolution by sulfuric acid sulfide oxidation in rivers of the canadian cordillera spence and telmer 2005 in karstic areas in sw china it is estimated that about 20 67 of so4 is from acid rain while others are mainly from oxidation of sulfide minerals based on carbon and sulphur isotopes and water chemistry of springs and rivers in guizhou sw china liu et al 2008 li et al 2008 results show that the contribution of cations from rock weathering induced by h2so4 accounts for approximately 11 42 li et al 2008 sun et al 2010 xu and liu 2010 the contribution of sulfuric acid to weathering rate depends on the amount of pyrite in the sediments meyer et al 2009 galy and france lanord 1999 and the sulfuric acid in rainfall li et al 2008 previous studies have mainly considered the weathering by acid rain in the form of h2so4 amiotte suchet et al 1995 sun et al 2010 huang et al 2015 however acid in some of the atmospheric precipitation is not only in the form of h2so4 or and hno3 but also as nh4 which could be a balancing cation for the so4 and no3 van breemen et al 1982 lerman et al 2007 like rainfall in north china xu et al 2012 zhai et al 2013 and in sw china zhang et al 2012 eanet 2017 the nitrification of nh4 can release protons h and contribute to additional carbonate dissolution van breemen et al 1982 etchanchu and probst 1988 appelo and postma 2005 however most studies have focused on the impact of nitrification of n fertilizers on carbonate dissolution etchanchu and probst 1988 semhi et al 2000 perrin et al 2008 jiang 2013 the aim of this study is to use chemical data of rainfall to systematically calculate carbonate weathering by acid rain of all types of acid during recharge in the area of interest the results would have important implications for the assessment of the carbon cycle and hydrogeochemical processes in acid rain affected areas 2 study area the study area of jiaoshi is located in the middle of chongqing city parallel to the province sw china fig 1 the area of chongqing city is approximately 82 400 km2 and carbonate rocks cover approximately 30 000 km2 karst spring is the most abundant source of water supplying 73 of total groundwater resources pu et al 2014 the area represents a transitional zone between the tibetan plateau and the middle to lower reaches of the yangtze river alluvial plain and is dominated by hilly topography various rivers belonging to the yangtze river system flow through the area conditions are typical of a subtropical humid monsoon climate with a high average annual temperature of 16 18 c the annual average precipitation is 1000 1200 mm and 62 of the total precipitation occurs in may september during rainstorms ni et al 2017 the lithologies of the shallow groundwater aquifer in the study area jiaoshi are light gray and gray limestone and dolomite of lower triassic age t1 j fig 1 lyu et al 2012 huang et al 2017 based on the jy1 borehole fig 1 the thickness of the lower triassic jianglingjiang group t1 j is 277 m the feixianguan group t1 f is 426 m the upper permian group p2 is 226 m and the lower permian group p1 is 474 m respectively the elevation mainly ranges from 400 to 800 m and dissecting depth ranges from 50 to 150 m lyu et al 2012 underground rivers and springs develop with depth less than 150 m lyu et al 2012 li 2014 the shallow groundwater outcrops in the term of springs there are almost no wells in the area discharge from large springs and underground rivers in the study area ranges from 100 l s to 1000 l s and the runoff modulus is more than 6 l s km2 although the type of lithology in the shallow aquifer is simple the anisotropy is strong enough to result in the heterogeneous occurrences of groundwater and cave springs in this area the study area is a mountainous area with little arable land the population is relatively sparse 180 pop km2 in 2011 based on the local statistical yearbook some springs are used for distributed domestic water supply one or more families use one spring sewage water has not been treated but drained to the watershed directly the amount of sewage is limited compared to total runoff 1 there are few industrial activities in this area chongqing has been suffered from air pollution and acid rain for a long time the annual average ph value from 1993 to 2007 ranged from 3 8 to 4 5 in the urban area he et al 2009 based on acid deposition monitoring network in east asia eanet 2017 the weighted annual average ph of precipitation from 2002 to 2015 in jinyunshan beibei district chongqing about 100 km far away from the study area fig 1 range from 3 94 to 4 70 with an average value of 4 35 the site represents a rural district that is less impacted by anthropogenic activities than those in urban areas which is similar to the study area in addition these areas are all affected by acid rain in the similar pattern mep 2016 therefore the rainfall in beibei is used to represent the precipitation chemical characteristics of the study area 3 sampling and analysis a total of 64 spring samples were collected in the jiaoshi in 2016 36 water samples in the rainy season may june and 28 samples in the dry season october november two sewage waters were also sampled for end member identification in addition 10 surface carbonate rock samples representing the lithology of the aquifer were obtained and analyzed for mineral and isotopic composition δ13c and δ18o for carbonate the locations of the spring and rock samples are shown in fig 1 physical and chemical parameters such as ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ using a multi parameter device hach hq40d all of the water samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane and stored in polypropylene bottles before analysis samples used for cation analysis were immediately acidified with distilled hno3 1 mol l to a ph of less than 2 all samples were preserved in a dark refrigerator at 4 c before laboratory analysis water chemistry analyses were performed in the beijing research institute of uranium geology briug beijing china anions f cl so4 and no3 were measured with a dionex 500 ion chromatograph with detection limit of 0 05 mg l and hco3 co3 were titrated using a 785 dmp titrator accuracy is 5 mg l cation k na ca mg analysis was performed via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima2x00 1500 with a detection limit of 0 05 mg l nh4 and no2 was measured using an ultraviolet visible spectroscopy based on the methods of gb t 5750 6 with detection limit of 0 02 mg l and 0 002 mg l stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h were measured using a laser absorption water isotope analyzer picarro l1102 i in the institute of geology and geophysics chinese academy of sciences igg cas beijing china the results are reported as δ2h and δ18o δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 using the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as the standard the analytical precision of the δ18o and δ2h measurements for the water samples are 0 1 and 0 5 respectively the δ13c and δ18o of the carbonate rock samples the lithology of shallow aquifer and δ13c dic of spring were analyzed using a mat 253 mass spectrometer at the igg cas with a standard deviation of 0 1 mineral composition of the rock samples were measured using a panalytical x pert pro in the igg cas 4 results 4 1 aquifer mineral and isotopic characteristics the mineral components of the rock samples are shown in table 1 the aquifer lithologies are free of feldspar and clay minerals and are mainly composed of calcite dolomite and very limited quartz with the exception of three samples dominated by dolomite calcite is the primary rock component the δ13c and δ18o values of carbonate were measured for the selected samples table 1 the isotopic compositions for carbonates range from 1 8 to 1 2 with an average of 1 5 for δ13c and from 6 6 to 7 0 with an average of 6 8 for δ18o the values are slightly more negative compared with the average value for marine carbonate δ13c of 0 and δ18o of 0 but consistent with the regional measurements of t1 j stratum huang et al 2016 4 2 water chemistry of rainfall based on the acid deposition monitoring network in jinyunshan beibei district chongqing from 2002 to 2015 eanet 2017 the ph values range from 3 94 to 4 70 with an average value of 4 35 table 2 the main cations as meq l are ca 39 nh4 35 and h 17 while the main anions are so4 78 and no3 18 fig 2 those values are consistent with other observations in the sw china such as guilin from 2009 01 to 2010 12 with average ph of 4 83 zhang et al 2012 and guiyang 1 from 1999 01 to 2001 10 with average ph of 4 63 han and liu 2006 2 from 2005 09 to 2010 08 with average ph of 4 43 luo et al 2013 and 3 from 2008 10 to 2009 09 with average ph of 4 23 xiao et al 2010 the nh4 contents in precipitation from 2002 to 2015 range from 1 126 mg l to 2 234 mg l with a weighted average value of 1 722 mg l table 2 close to the value of 1 65 mg l in guilin from 2009 01 to 2010 12 zhang et al 2012 and 2 03 mg l in guiyang from 2008 10 to 2009 09 xiao et al 2010 the weighted average no3 content in precipitation is 2 8 mg l 4 3 water chemistry and isotopic composition of springs the data for major ions ph and stable isotope values of spring water in wet and dry season are shown in table 3 in the rainy season the ph values of spring water range from 7 4 to 8 6 with an average of 7 9 all neutral to slightly alkaline the total dissolved solids tds values range from 146 mg l to 357 mg l with an average value of 257 mg l the ph values of spring water in dry season range from 7 1 to 8 1 with an average value of 7 6 and tds values range from 158 to 414 mg l with an average value of 283 mg l which is slightly higher than that in rainy season the main anions of the spring water samples for both the rainy season and dry season are hco3 followed by so4 the hco3 and so4 contents in the shallow spring range from 118 mg l to 375 mg l and from 11 mg l to 58 mg l respectively taking the milligram equivalent concentration meq l ratio of 59 93 and 5 31 for total anions the main cation constituents are ca and mg with concentration of 43 130 mg l and 2 9 40 mg l respectively accounting for 57 95 and 5 43 for total cations based on the piper diagram fig 3 ca is the dominant cation in the spring samples 50 in meq l while hco3 is the dominant anion 50 in meq l the water types are divided into three kinds namely hco3 ca type hco3 so4 ca type and hco3 ca mg type the hco3 ca type is dominated by the hydrochemical type during the rainy season the na and cl contents are relatively low ranging from 0 3 mg l to 21 mg l and from 0 9 mg l to 29 mg l respectively in the dry season the na and cl contents of spring samples range from 0 6 mg l to 15 mg l and from 2 5 mg l to 32 mg l respectively the average value for na and cl is 2 1 mg l and 5 2 mg l respectively nh4 and no2 has not been detected in any spring water samples the nh4 in precipitation may be nitrified to no3 during recharge and then the no3 can be consumed by plants van breemen et al 1982 shen et al 1993 appelo and postma 2005 since the vegetation is dense in the area the no3 of spring water samples concentrations range from 0 1 mg l to 71 mg l with an average of 13 0 mg l and a median value of 8 8 mg l the δ18o and δ2h values 36 samples range from 3 8 to 7 0 and from 17 1 to 43 7 respectively in the wet season table 3 as shown in fig 4 all shallow spring samples lie close to the local meteoric water line lmwl of δ2h 8 73δ18o 15 73 li et al 2010 obtained from the beibei district precipitation station but deviate from the global meteoric water line gmwl of δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 this indicates that spring waters are recharged by local precipitation in the region without significant evaporation the tritium 6 5 8 6 tu and 14c 95 4 98 6 pmc contents suggest that all springs in the study area is modern li et al 2016 the spring samples in the dry season 7 samples suffer from slight evaporation compared with those of the wet season fig 4 a common meteoric origin shows that all of the geochemical modifications were induced from water rock interactions in the shallow aquifers the δ13c dic of spring water ranges narrowly from 12 5 to 11 0 with an average value of 11 6 4 4 origin of hydrochemical constituents chloride behaves conservatively in the hydrological cycle ma et al 2003 but it can be introduced by rainfall recharge human activities such as domestic sewage and fertilizers and mineral dissolution of evaporites in a catchment in this study area there are no evaporites in the shallow groundwater aquifer according to systematic rainfall monitoring data eanet 2017 and spring water chemistry the na cl of precipitation the symbol of represents meq l in the text and spring samples is almost the same approximately 0 6 fig 5 a suggesting that the origin of the springs is from local meteoric water or other sources with similar ratio the na cl ratios of sewage waters locate on the fit line of precipitation all shallow spring samples have higher na and cl contents than the rain samples which suggests that the spring water experienced concentration by transpiration no evaporation concentration because stable isotopic results show no evaporation signal and may be influenced by human activities such as the utilization of fertilizers and mixing with sewage waters the so4 cl ratios of spring are different from those of rain spring water is enriched in cl compared with rainfall fig 5b because so4 and cl are all conservative tracers in shallow system the relatively enriched cl suggests additional cl input to groundwater system in the study area mixing with distributed sewage water and utilization of fertilizers are the two possible reasons fig 5c shows that the latter may be the dominant factor controlling spring cl and no3 because their concentrations increase simultaneously sewage waters have relatively high cl concentrations but similar so4 concentration of spring fig 5b when the no3 concentrations of spring increase the so4 concentrations do not covary but always vary in a large range fig 5d while the average nh4 contents in rainfall is 1 722 mg l it has not detected in any spring samples 0 02 mg l as spring waters are recharged by rainfall the phenomenon could be attributed to the nitrification of ammonia by autotrophic bacteria during recharge processes van breemen et al 1982 etchanchu and probst 1988 semhi et al 2000 appelo and postma 2005 1 nh 4 2 o 2 2 h no 3 h 2 o two protons worth of acidity are produced for every ammonium ion that is oxidized so this process tends to make the environment more acidic howarth 2002 therefore both the h in rainfall and the h produced by ammonium nitrification during recharge can weather the carbonate rocks and provide additional ca mg and hco3 in spring waters 4 5 proportion of carbonate dissolution by acid rain spring waters are only recharged by rainfall in the study area the direct chemical input and rainfall weathering can be identified the total nh4 in rainfall are assumed to be all nitrified in this oxidizing environment based on chemical composition of rainfall fig 2 the total h would be 0 87 0 17 of rainfall itself and 2 times of nh4 as 1 meq l h can produce 1 meq l hco3 and 2 meq l ca mg when weathering carbonate 2 h ca x mg 1 x co 3 xca 1 x mg hco 3 the hco3 would be 0 87 and the total ca mg would be 2 16 0 42 of rainfall itself and 2 times of total h the proportion of so4 in rainfall is 0 78 therefore the direct rainfall input and rainfall weathering of carbonate would result in ca mg hco3 of 2 48 and so4 hco3 of 0 90 fig 6 however the carbonate weathering purely by soil co2 3 co 2 h 2 o ca x mg 1 x co 3 xca 1 x mg 2hco 3 would result in ca mg hco3 of 1 and so4 hco3 of 0 fig 6 shows that spring waters locate in the range between the two end members 1 carbonate weathering by soil co2 weathering and 2 rainfall input weathering because the shallow aquifer is composed of relatively pure carbonate rocks the dissolution of carbonates by co2 and acid rain may be the main source of dic spring ca mg so4 and hco3 are mainly from 1 rainfall deposition subscript by r and then concentrated by transpiration and limited evaporation subscript by rc 2 weathering carbonate by concentrated acid rain subscript by rw and 3 weathering carbonate by soil co2 subscript by cw 4 ca mg r so 4 r h r nh 4 r ca mg rc so 4 rc h rc nh 4 rc 5 h rc ca x mg 1 x co 3 xca 1 x mg rw1 hco 3 rw1 6 nh 4 rc 2 o 2 2 ca x mg 1 x co 3 2 xca 2 2 x mg rw 2 2 hco 3 rw 2 no 3 rw h 2 o 7 co 2 h 2 o ca x mg 1 x co 3 xca 1 x mg cw 2 hco 3 cw in eq 5 1 meq l h rc can produce 2 meq l ca mg rw1 and 1 meq l hco3 rw1 in eq 6 1 meq l nh4 rc can produce 4 meq l ca mg rw2 and 2 meq l hco3 rw2 while in eq 7 the meq l ratio of ca mg cw and hco3 cw is 1 if the rainfall deposition enrichment factor f is known then spring ca mg rc from direct input of rainfall can be calculated by multiplying ca mg in rainfall by f the ca mg rw1 hco3 rw1 ca mg rw2 and hco3 rw2 can also be calculated by the content of h rc and nh4 rc notably while ions such as ca mg cl no3 and so4 would be concentrated by the enrichment factor f h rc and nh4 rc represent constant weathering though the expression is labeled in the same way there are little sulfate such as gypsum or sulfur minerals such as pyrite fes2 in the shallow aquifer of t1 j carbonate although in the deep aquifer with well depth up to 2160 m there may be gypsum or anhydrite embedded in the t1 j carbonate where there are geothermal water with estimated reservoir temperature of more than 60 c yang et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 this is a reasonable assumption for shallow aquifer because even though there were sulfur minerals in the shallow aquifer the relatively quick water cycle has taken those minerals out of the watershed allison and hughes 1978 the average value of so4 so4 hco3 co3 cl no3 in the study area is 14 significantly lower than values 24 29 in the areas affected by sulfide oxidation in sw china liu et al 2008 in the study area the springs are all modern water recharged since the 1950s li et al 2016 meanwhile the so4 concentration in sewage water is similar to that in spring which does not alter the concentration of so4 in spring in addition the amount of the sewage water is very limited in this mountainous area with few inhabitants distributed population if spring so4 is only derived from precipitation which is a reasonable assumption in the study area the enrichment factor f of rainfall to spring can be obtained by dividing so4 in spring by so4 in rainfall scanlon et al 2010 lin et al 2013 the weighted average so4 content in rainfall was 9 55 mg l from 2002 to 2015 table 2 the enrichment factor ranges from 1 2 to 4 9 with an average value of 3 5 in the rainy season and ranges from 2 1 to 6 1 with an average of 3 8 in the dry season when f is obtained for each spring sample then the ca mg from rain deposition ca mg rc f ca mg r and from weathering carbonate by acid rain h rc f h r nh4 rc f nh4 r can be obtained the weathering proportion r by acid rain can be determined by dividing the ca mg weathered from rainfall h rc ca mg rw1 and from nitrification of nh4 rc ca mg rw2 by the total ca mg in spring ca mg t subtracting the direct rain input ca mg rc 8 r c a m g r w 1 c a m g r w 2 c a m g t c a m g rc the results table 4 show that the contribution to carbonate dissolution by acid rain h nh4 ranges from 12 to 58 with an average value of 35 for the rainy season and from 18 to 59 with an average value of 37 for the dry season the average value for the rainy and dry seasons is approximately 36 the error is from the deviation of so4 and h nh4 content in rainfall as the so4 has a standard deviation σ of 3 04 mg l 31 and h nh4 of 29 in precipitation those deviations would result in a total deviation of 43 when considering the variation of so4 content in precipitation the range from 6 51 to 12 59 mg l overlaps the observed value of 8 38 mg l in guilin zhang et al 2012 and 9 02 12 75 mg l in guiyang han and liu 2006 xiao et al 2010 consequently the average proportion of carbonate dissolution by acid rain of would be 36 15 when error is considered 5 discussion when the ca mg from rainfall direct input i e ca mg rc and ca mg from rainfall h nh4 weathering i e ca mg cw1 cw2 is subtracted from spring ca mg i e ca mg t and hco3 from rainfall h nh4 weathering i e hco3 cw1 cw2 is subtracted from spring hco3 i e hco3 t the residual ca mg t rc rw1 rw2 and hco3 t rw1 rw2 can be roughly considered as co2 weathering process which lies around the line of 1 1 of ca mg hco3 fig 7 suggesting the calculation is reasonable as the carbon in hco3 cw1 cw2 is only from carbonate caxmg1 xco3 the δ13c hco3 cw1 cw2 should be equal to the δ13c caxmg1 xco3 of 1 5 eqs 5 and 6 table 1 the residual hco3 is from co2 weathering of carbonate and half carbon of hco3 is from co2 aq δ13c of 24 1 for dissolved co2 aq for c3 vegetation δ13c for soil gas is 23 under temperature of 10 25 c clark and fritz 1997 and the other half is from caxmg1 xco3 δ13c of 1 5 eq 7 resulting in δ13c hco3 of 12 8 the saturation indexes of calcite si c calculated using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 are all larger than 0 from 0 03 to 1 25 with average of 0 62 table 4 which indicates that calcite levels are over saturated in spring waters based on the result from table 4 the δ13c hco3 in spring can be calculated because the ph of spring waters ranges from 7 1 to 8 6 the hco3 dominates the dic shen et al 1993 appelo and postma 2005 table 5 shows that most of the measured δ13c dic values are more depleted than calculated δ13c hco3 the spring pco2 calculated using phreeqc ranges from 2455 to 6607 ppmv note pco2 of 360 ppmv for atmosphere and 3 000 30 000 ppmv for soil gas suggesting δ13c dic may have isotopic exchange in this open karst groundwater system telmer and veizer 1999 and the complete equilibrium between hco3 and co2 g would result in δ13c hco3 ranging from 15 7 to 14 3 at temperature of 18 31 c for spring waters mook et al 1974 clark and fritz 1997 the proportion calculated from rainfall data in this study stands for the upper limit of the contribution of rainfall weathering on carbonate rock firstly the enrichment factor f is obtained by assuming the spring so4 are all from rainfall although it is a reasonable assumption in the study area f stands for the upper limit if there is additional so4 in spring waters e g caso4 dissolution fes2 oxidation fertilization secondly the nh4 in rainfall are considered to be all nitrified during recharge processes if the method from huang et al 2015 is used which assumed that the weathering from acid rainfall is in the form of h2so4 dissolution and the excess of ca mg over hco3 in spring water are all contribution by h2so4 dissolution the average proportion in the study area would be 55 significantly larger than the result 36 based on the rainfall data because the chemical composition of rainfall is not only h2so4 but mainly caso4 and nh4so4 fig 2 and their method is based on groundwater river itself it has therefore overestimated the weathering contribution of acid rainfall based on the characteristics of acid rain table 2 and fig 2 the contribution of nh4 nitrification is about 4 times higher than that from direct acidity of rainfall the average contribution of nh4 nitrification in precipitation during recharge to the total carbonate weathering is 29 in the study area which is comparable to the value of 12 26 in the garonne basin france dominated by carbonate rocks semhi et al 2000 however the nh4 for the garonne basin is derived from n fertilizer spreading the fore mentioned all suggests that the significant contribution of acid rain with high concentration of nh4 on carbonate weathering and further affects the co2 budget 6 conclusions this study provides a quantitative geochemical method to estimate the impact of acid rain on the carbonate weathering using hydrogeochemical data of rainfall it represents the upper limit of the contribution from rainfall h nh4 weathering in the jiaoshi watershed the average contribution ratio from acid rain weathering to the total carbonate weathering is 36 15 the value is less than the result obtained from the previous method which assumed that the so4 in acid rain is all in the form of h2so4 or so4 in groundwater is all from h2so4 weathering this study is helpful in understanding the hydrogeochemical processes in acid rain areas and in calculating co2 sources sinks of carbonate weathering
