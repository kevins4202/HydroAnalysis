19525,cyanobacterial blooms have emerged as one of the most severe ecological problems affecting large and shallow freshwater lakes to improve our understanding of the factors that influence and could be used to predict surface blooms this study developed a novel euler lagrangian coupled approach combining the eulerian model with agent based modelling abm the approach was subsequently verified based on monitoring datasets and modis data in a large shallow lake lake taihu china the eulerian model solves the eulerian variables and physiological parameters whereas abm generates the complete life cycle and transport processes of cyanobacterial colonies this model ensemble performed well in fitting historical data and predicting the dynamics of cyanobacterial biomass bloom distribution and area based on the calculated physical and physiological characteristics of surface blooms principal component analysis pca captured the major processes influencing surface bloom formation at different stages two bloom clusters early bloom outbreaks were influenced by physical processes horizontal transport and vertical turbulence induced mixing whereas buoyancy controlling strategies were essential for mature bloom outbreaks canonical correlation analysis cca revealed the combined actions of multiple environment variables on different bloom clusters the effects of buoyancy controlling strategies isp vertical turbulence induced mixing velocity of colony vmt and horizontal drift velocity of colony hdt were quantitatively compared using scenario simulations in the coupled model vmt accounted for 52 9 of bloom formations and maintained blooms over long periods thus demonstrating the importance of wind induced turbulence in shallow lakes in comparison hdt and buoyancy controlling strategies influenced blooms at different stages in conclusion the approach developed here presents a promising tool for understanding the processes of onshore offshore algal blooms formation and subsequent predicting graphical abstract image 1 keywords agent based model eulerian model microcystis blooms physiological process physical process 1 introduction as the third largest freshwater eutrophic lake in china lake taihu has been subject to harmful cyanobacterial blooms cyanohabs dominated by microcystis spp paerl and huisman 2008 because of excessive nutrient inputs to the lake these blooms present a serious threat to drinking water supplies aquatic life human health and the ecological sustainability of the freshwater ecosystem of this region a central question facing water researchers and managers is how to predict the spatial temporal pattern of surface blooms in large shallow lakes this question is of immense importance for estimating the risk of cyanobacterial occurrence in advance understanding the growth and transport process of microcystis is essential for resolving this question wynne et al 2013 previous studies have identified a host of physiological processes underlying the excessive in situ proliferation of microcystis colonies particularly from the perspective of biological responses such as nutrient induced over enrichment reynolds 2006 paerl et al 2011b photosynthesis takamura et al 1985 colony formation avoiding predation reynolds et al 1981 and buoyancy controlling strategies isp reynolds 1973 reynolds et al 1987 ndong et al 2017 in deep lakes the response to buoyancy changes would be on the order of days and stationary behavior reduce the chance to accumulation on water surface chien et al 2013 medrano et al 2013 therefore the occurrence of surface bloom in shallow lake is more sensitive to physical transport process within minute scale than that in deep lake wallace et al 2000 duan et al 2009 wang et al 2017 the physical transport processes of colony comprise of vertical turbulence induced mixing velocity vmt and horizontal drift speed hdt wu et al 2015 and cao et al 2006 emphasized the strong relationship between surface bloom formation and wind induced turbulence in lake taihu china the impacts of wind induced surface drift and wave induced stokes drift on offshore onshore bloom migration have been increasingly acknowledged ishikawa et al 2002 wu et al 2010 deng et al 2016 hua et al 2016 in addition buoyancy control and vertical transport processes have been also observed to interact wallace and hamilton 1999 wallace et al 2000 recently differences in morphology as a result of different growth environments which influence colony size have been shown to contribute to diverse transport patterns deng et al 2016 therefore both physiological process especially isp and physical processes vmt and hdt should be evaluated to understand the timing and intensity of specific surface blooms glibert et al 2010 otten et al 2012 however few studies and technologies have integrated these nonlinear complex and interactive processes or compared their respective contributions in shallow lakes using field data to demonstrate the spatial temporal distribution of surface cyanobacterial blooms presents a considerable challenge furthermore linking this information to bio physical changes is even more problematic recently satellite imagery such as modis data has been used to detect the spatiotemporal patterns of surface bloom areas over large domains relating these patterns to changing environmental conditions wynne et al 2011 qin et al 2015 however the information acquired from satellite imagery might obscure microcystis adaptive migratory movement patterns buoyancy controlling strategy as such patterns are three dimensional induced by water current and or wind especially in shallow lakes different responses of growth to variation in light temperature and nutrient levels across seasons must also be considered thus numerical techniques might be required to complement satellite data agent based models abm have been widely applied to capture 2 d and 3 d transport trajectories of cyanobacteria over periods of several days dippner et al 2011 wynne et al 2011 2013 henrichs et al 2015 most abm models are forced with the physical environment from an eulerian model allowing the agents each representing certain cyanobacteria to drift around thus experiencing different biological processes with water quality variables in abm models the system properties are said to emerge from the properties of the individual particles grimm and railsback 2005 both individual physiological properties and physical drivers could be easily integrated into agent based equations to describe complex ecological processes as described in hellweger et al 2008 and glibert et al 2010 however the calibration of phytoplankton parameters in abm is difficult because of the enormous computation requirements therefore the preliminary calibrated euler based physical biological model which describes the concentration of the distribution of cumulative individuals should be integrated into abm to obtain associated physiological parameters of cyanobacteria and water quality variables the increasingly complex euler based ecological models help us to capture the response of ecological systems to the external environment butenschön et al 2016 rolighed et al 2016 the fortran based framework for aquatic biogeochemical models fabm was developed by bruggeman and bolding 2014 in which the biochemical model was arbitrarily connected to a physical model here we combined a self contained complex biological model called gem to a well known hydrodynamic model fvcom by fabm this euler based model was used to calibrate the physiological parameters for phytoplankton in lake taihu in china algae begin to emerge from the sediment and aggregate to form the early blooming stage april june before mass propagation during the mature blooming stage july october when the water temperature is persistently high kong and fao 2005 cao and yang 2010 therefore we assumed that the blooms detected at different stages have specific physiological and physical characteristics in the present study we improved the original agent based model of wang et al 2017b and tested our hypothesis furthermore we evaluated the performance of the coupled euler lagrangian model using field investigated data and modis data to demonstrate our ability to reproduce the spatial patterns of algal blooms and characterize the physiological and physical variables of blooms we also used the coupled model to simulate several scenarios and identify the individual contributions of physiological processes and physical processes of microcystis to surface bloom in the shallow lake system our results are expected to provide new insights on the parameters that drive algal blooms thus providing a basis on which to predict onshore offshore blooms in such a large domain 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lake taihu 30 55ʹ40ʺ 31 32ʹ58ʺ n 119 52ʹ32ʺ 120 36ʹ10ʺ e is located in the lower part of the yangtze river delta china it is a well known large shallow and eutrophic lake fig 1 lake taihu covers an area of about 2338 km2 with an average depth of 1 9 m and maximum depth of 2 64 m severe cyanobacterial blooms occur between april and october hu et al 2006 the cyanobacteria are primarily microcystis spp which is a colony forming cyanobacterial species consisting of mucilage gas vesicles and cells qin et al 2015 therefore the physiological and physical processes of microcystis were chosen to represent that of all the cyanobacterial species in this study mlb 31 4929 n 120 2074 e represents the validation site for the eulerian model 2 2 model overview we modified a type of model ensemble referred to as an eulerian abm hybrid in wang et al 2017b in this study the eulerian model call as gem was improved with ecological processes by fabm to consider the feedback between nutrient field and physical structure and proliferation of cyanobacteria physiological consideration of three phytoplankton species diatom chlorophytes and cyanobacteria has been included into eulerian model neither zooplankton nor fish was considered in our coupled model abm focuses on the physiological and physical characteristic of cyanobacteria i e microcystis and models the formation of surface bloom the abm model is a particle based framework that describes the agent based representation of microcystis each agent has its own upscaling number that specifies the number of colonies that it represents and the colony number in agent keeps constant during simulation the biological processes of microcystis in these two models were the same overall the eulerian models were run first during each time step followed by the abm models allowing the eulerian variables nutrient and detritus to interact with physiological growth carbon and intracellular nutrient content of microcystis as shown in the schematic of gem fig a2 then the calculated physical field such as temperature and chemical field such as dissolved nutrient from eulerian model were directly forced to modify agent physiology such as biomass and colony size and transport pattern in abm meanwhile the preliminary euler based physical biological model supplied associated physiological parameters for abm details of this coupled model including parameters equations concepts of agent summary of agents are provided in the supporting information here we provide a brief description of the agent based model the variables of the microcystis agent and related parameters are presented in table 1 and table a1 respectively 2 2 1 biological processes of the agent the intracellular biomass in individual agent changes as a function of limited growth and death 1 d p c d t μ p μ d p c where p c g c agent 1 is the agent biomass i e agent size the chlorophyll a of agent could be acquired by multiplying p c by a fixed ratio δ c h l a c which is easier for monitoring and model calibration μ p d 1 is the specific proliferation rate of agent biomass i e physiological growth of agent and μ d d 1 is the mortality rate for simplicity the mortality rate which affects carbon content and therefore buoyancy includes respiration excretion and predation loss details about biological processes can be seen in section s3 3 supporting information 2 2 2 transport processes of the agent in the original abm transport equations advection and wind induced mixing terms were included along with the surface wind drift on surface scum under low wind conditions when the wind speed exceeded a critical value approximately 3 m s webster and hutchinson 1994 and even though surface cyanobacterial cells tended to be distributed in the deeper layer they were still transported by stokes drift generated by wind induced waves hua et al 2016 therefore the optimized pyhsical dynamics of the cyanobacterial communities is 2 x i t δ t x i t u d t u a d d i t i o n a l d t ξ t 2 d h i t δ t 3 y i t δ t y i t v d t v a d d i t i o n a l d t ξ t 2 d h i t δ t 4 z i t δ t z i t w s d t d v z i t d t ξ t 2 d v z δ t where x y and z are the agent locations u and v are the passive current induced horizontal velocity terms and w s is the buoyancy controlling velocity i e isp d h represents the horizontal dispersion coefficients l2 t 1 ξ t is an independent normally distributed random variable with zero mean and unit variance the second and third terms on the right hand side of eq 2 and eq 3 represent horizontal displacement of agent i e hdt for the third and fourth terms on the right hand side of eq 4 we chose the visser 1997 scheme as the random walk vertical mixing scheme to describe the vertical turbulence induced displacement of colonies i e vmt d v l2 t 1 is the vertical diffusivity and d v d v dz is the vertical gradient of d v z z i t 1 2 d v z i t δ t is the vertical position that is displaced as a function of the diffusivity gradient the details about surface wind drift and wave induced stokes drift can be seen in section s3 3 5 supporting information w s the buoyancy controlling velocity termed isp is the adaptive biological trait of microcystis for higher growth rate this adaptive behaviour was estimated using a modified stokes law which reproduced the observed vertical behaviour of floating up or down we calculated an equilibrium speed of the agent which was related to density and diameter of colonies 5 w s gd c 2 ρ w ρ col 18 ϑ f o r d c 400 μ m gd c 2 ρ w ρ col 18 ϑ 24 r e 24 r e 0 124 0 5 0 352 2 f o r d c 400 μ m where d c is the equivalent diameter of the colony

information as carbon content of agent increasing the diameter of colony in each agent increased g is the acceleration due to gravity ϑ is the viscosity of water and ρ c o l and ρ w are the density of the microcystis colony and the water respectively in this version the non linear drag was added on stokes drag coefficient to avoid the over predicted rising sinking velocity of large colonies 400 μm with high reynolds numbers medrano et al 2013 portalier et al 2016 re is the reynolds number and was approximately estimated as ρ c o l d c ϑ gd c 2 ρ w ρ col 18 ϑ overlooking the recursive relationship between speed and drag in previous studies density changes were incorporated as a function of light regime without considering the influences of temperature and nutrients at an annual scale thus the density equations used here were those of rabouille et al 2005 in which the fluctuations of colony density resulted from the dynamics of carbohydrate reserve metabolism see section s3 3 6 supporting information 2 3 data acquisition and statistical analysis every 3 h meteorological data were downloaded from http www meteomanz com the discharge and water quality data such as nitrogen phosphorus and detritus of inflow rivers around lakes were collected from 2008 to 2009 the monthly surface at depths of 0 5 m biomass of microcystis were recorded in meiliang bay which is the bloom influenced domain of the lake fig 1 in eulerian model the simulated results of temperature cyanobacteria biomass and nutrient concentration were compared with these measured data in the supporting information the calibration and validation period of eulerian module are in 2008 and 2009 respectively to detect the appearance of blooms in this large lake cyanobacterial bloom events were obtained from satellite images from april to october in 2008 a total of 20 treated remote sensing images modis were obtained from the lake watershed science data center national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science technology infrastructure of china http lake geodata cn the treated remote sensing images only demonstrate the spatial bloom distribution green color on water surface without information about chlorophyll a concentration a bloom case is assumed to be detected in remote sensing images when chlorophyll a c h a excced 20 μg l qin et al 2015 in abm the cumulative effect of all the agents was considered when calculating the mass budget from agent pools p c to the concentration for bloom detection the local mesh will be dyed to green such as a series of pictures in fig 3b when calculated c h a in surface layer exceeds 20 μg l the abm based model skill assessments were conducted using a binary categorical variable bloom or no bloom by comparing pixel by pixel the modelled bloom map with remote sensing observations the skill assessment statistics of rowe et al 2016 was applied in this study the frequency bias b gives the ratio of the number of forecasts of occurrence to the number of observed occurrences 6 b a b a c where the number of a correctly predicted events hits b false events false alarms c false negatives misses and d correct non events an unbiased forecast has a frequency bias b 1 0 the pierce skill score p s s gives the hit rate minus the false alarm rate 7 p s s a d b c a d b c p s s ranges from 1 0 to 1 0 with positive values indicating that the hit rate was greater than the false positive rate thus the model had acceptable skills the pixel setting and skill assessment were achieved by matlab programming details provided in the section s4 supporting information a principal component analysis pca was conducted to cluster the bloom events based on different types of characteristics of blooms five characteristics have been used in pca i e biomass pc colony density ρ col turbulence induced mixing velocity of colony vmt horizontal drift velocity of colony hdt and buoyancy controlling velocity of colony isp analysis of similarities anosim which is a non parametric statistical method was used to test the significant difference between clusters canonical correlation analysis cca was performed to determine the relationship between significant environmental variables and bloom composition wang et al 2017a wind speed light water temperature nutrients din and dip and water level were used for significant environmental variables in cca the surface bloom characteristic describes bloom composition the surface bloom characteristic in cca represented all of the associated auxiliary processes of microcystis calculated in abm model the associated auxiliary processes contained carbohydrate reserve process intracellular nutrient uptake rate growth rate mortality rate hdt vmt and so on pca anosim and cca analyses were carried out using r 3 4 0 software 2 4 model application 2 4 1 model evaluation the calibration and validation of the eulerian model with cyanobacteria biomass are presented in section s1 and section s2 supporting information which supply associated physiological parameters and water quality variables for the following abm a certain number of particles were released at the beginning of the simulation in each water covered mesh excluding the plant covered meshes the collection of agents and implementation of abm are shown in section s3 and s4 supporting information we then ran the abm to produce a one year simulation output at hourly intervals to evaluate the model performance bloom coverage in surface layer of local mesh against detected 20 bloom mapping pixel by pixel the cell centred tracer control elements were used as control volumes for converting total agent size to the concentration of chlorophyll a chla 2 4 2 hindcast simulation based on the established model numerical scenarios were conducted to separate the influence of physiological and physical processes of microcystis colonies on surface bloom formation to identify the individual contribution of isp vmt and hdt on the occurrence of cyanohabs we carried out four groups of scenarios which are shown in table 2 the individual components of isp vmt and hdt were embodied or neglected by abm for the entire annual simulation all scenarios were conducted with the same external boundaries and model parameters c0 was the calculated concentration which should be validated against the field investigated data the differences between the calculated results of each scenario and c0 indicate individual contributions for all scenarios the biological processes which describe the growth and death of agents were included this simple additive method can quantify the relative importance among different factors although interaction between factors exists 3 results 3 1 summary of skill statistics of the model ensemble our previous paper showed that 1 d random walk simulations reasonably approximate the changing vertical distributions of microcystis colonies in response to varying turbulence in the current study we advanced this work to test whether the inclusion of biological process in the coupled model could be utilized to predict the occurrence of spatial blooms in a large shallow lake fig 2a shows the statistical value of biomass calibration in the eulerian model whereas fig 2b shows the time series of biomass concentration the time and intensity of biomass peak was well captured whereas the deviation of the modelled and measured values during the period of calibration and validation was acceptable fig 2 the calibration and statistical evaluation of other water quality variables are presented in section s2 supporting information the frequency bias b and pierce skill pss of 20 scenarios during april to october are shown in fig 3a for the 2008 simulation the pierce skill score pss produced positive values in all cases positive values of pss indicate that the model was more effective than a random forecast or constant bloom or no bloom prediction hogan and mason 2012 the frequency bias remained within a reasonable range the frequency bias was larger than 1 0 for 13 out of the 20 scenarios indicating an overall bias towards over prediction for simulations 11 12 13 and 15 large frequency bias represented oversized simulated blooms both indicators showed that our abm model performed well in most cases to test whether the model was able to match the observed spatially varying bloom coverage by modis pixel by pixel comparison of a selected simulation day for one scenario per month was conducted fig 3b fig 3b compared the number of pixels that are flagged as likely having cyanobacterial blooms the critical wind intensity for bloom formation in lake taihu is 3 2 m s cao et al 2006 large bloom coverage was detected on 19 may which was a calm day wind 1 2 m s with intense events throughout the western region b 1 19 pss 0 6374 the calm wind coupled with enough biomass seen in fig 3b contributed to this phenomenon in the following scenario in june wind increased to 4 m s and both modis and model indicated reduced surface bloom intensity b 1 11 pss 0 2565 164 5 km2 in simulation 11 27 july and simulation 13 26 aug wind speed decreased to 2 4 m s and oversized simulated bloom coverages were depicted in the western region b 1 8359 and 1 4637 respectively in simulation 16 18 september optimum water temperature contributed to the peak in biomass fig 3b a subsequent easterly calm wind 2 4 m s caused the surface bloom to expand 500 km2 toward the north westerly part of the lake b 1 0807 pss 0 596 unfortunately the emergence of blooms in meiliang bay were missed in our model on 14 oct simulation 19 a persistent easterly wind 1 2 m s induced a severe bloom outbreak in the entire area of meiliang bay which was captured by our coupled model the performance of coupled model for bloom size was acceptable as seen in fig 3c comparison of spatial simulation results and detected bloom mapping for all 20 modis images are shown in fig a7 therefore the changing map and size of bloom over long time scale from april to october were successfully captured in most cases although over prediction exists overall both the skill assessment and pixel comparison showed that our coupled model was able to simulate changing surface blooms in response to changing current wind induced movement and physiological status of microcystis 3 2 statistical analysis of bloom characteristics and relationship with environmental conditions our coupled model could record the physiological value of surface blooms such as biomass colony density and isp while also capturing temporally varying physical value of blooms as vmt and hdt therefore these five variables were used to distinguish 20 sets of surface microcystis blooms in pca when data from the modelled results within the lake were analysed by pca ordination the bloom community formed two clusters fig 4a the first three principal components axis1 axis2 and axis3 explained 37 5 25 28 and 23 16 of total variance respectively thirteen of the simulated blooms red circles in fig 4a were clustered in one community and were strongly associated with vmt and hdt of surface microcystis the other seven simulated blooms blue circles in fig 4a were clustered as a single separate community which was strongly associated with biomass density and isp the p value which calculated by anosim equaled 0 017 the low p value demonstrated the significant difference between two clusters the former cluster primarily contained blooms from april to june except for bloom 19 and bloom 20 whereas the latter cluster contained blooms from july to october cca was used to analyse the relationship of environmental conditions with bloom composition fig 4b the cca model accounted for 48 1 of variation in the bloom composition data the first two axes explained up to 37 67 axis 1 and 10 31 axis 2 of variation the variables that were most strongly correlated with these axes were din light and water temperature as shown by the arrows length in fig 4b similarly the first axis of the cca separated the communities of early bloom events left part of the graph from late bloom events right part of the graph early blooms were associated with abundant din high solar radiation and high temperature mature blooms were positively associated with water level and dip and were negatively associated with light and temperature additionally wind during bloom period with shortest arrow length explained the least variation 3 3 contribution of physiological and physical processes to bloom formation the results of hindcast simulations carried out within whole lake were analyzed to assess the contribution of hdt isp and vmt to surface scum area during different bloom stages fig 5 during early bloom stage hdt and vmt account for bloom occurrences 33 3 and 43 3 respectively otherwise isp has the least influence on bloom area extension 29 8 as time goes on vmt and isp control 82 4 of bloom formation 55 1 and 27 3 respectively however the importance of hdt decreases to 17 6 overall vertical turbulence induced mixing had the largest impact on bloom formation during the whole bloom stage in the shallow lake results of scenarios analysis for all 20 bloom cases are shown in fig a8 smaller even no area of bloom happened for most cases when turbulence induced mixing velocity of agent vmt was excluded an example of a spatial distribution map bloom 16 was used to reflect the importance of vmt fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of surface blooms under different scenarios at 11 17 on 18 september 2008 scenario a shows the baseline of the simulation considering all hdt vmt and isp a large section of the bloom approximately 500 km2 was simulated in the northern part of the lake scenario b shows the modelled results when considering only hdt colonies always remained at the depth at which they were released a bloom was only detected in the southwestern near shore region of the lake scenario c shows a larger bloom area in the northern region when only excluding isp interestingly scenario d shows no blooms occurring in any part of the lake when only vmt was excluded from the abm model 4 discussion cyanobacterial blooms occur as a result of the proliferation and migration of cyanobacteria because of the complex interaction between active physiological induced growth and passive physical induced transport a hybrid of eulerian and agent based methods represents a useful tool for resolving this non linear problem the eulerian model incorporated fvom fabm and gem the previously calibrated fvom part of the model provided hydrodynamic forcing such as water current temperature profile and turbulence diffusivity for each super individual in a local mesh in addition the validated physiological parameters which are conveyed as biological processes in abm are also supplied by fabm gem to avoid high computation costs to capture the spatial temporal position of microcystis accurately we added growth responses wave generated stokes drift and carbohydrate reserve metabolism based on our original agent based model wang et al 2017b we then confirmed that the spatial comparison between the hybrid model results with modis and sampling data followed the actual pattern in the distribution of cyanobacteria from a small colony to surface scum along with horizontal or vertical transport the rigorous verification process used in this study confirmed that our approach which incorporated the physiological characteristics of surface cyanobacteria was able to reflect bloom events under different environmental conditions most published papers have analysed the occurrence or characteristics of blooms using simple linear analysis between bloom area and or biomass with potential explanatory variables such as wind and temperature zhu et al 2014 wu et al 2015 however the relationship between environmental variables and bloom events is indirect and non linear the specific characteristics of surface blooms such as growth rate vertical velocity and density have been consistently overlooked in the analyses of previous studies this issue might lead to the understanding of physical and physiological processes that regulate blooms at different times being incomplete therefore multivariate statistical analysis was used to disentangle the relationship between bloom events and the specific characteristics of surface blooms based on auxiliary information provided by the coupled model horizontal transport speed hdt mainly wind induced and passive vertical speed vmt turbulence induced mixing of surface microcystis blooms were used as the physical features of formed surface scum biomass pc colony density and buoyant velocity isp were used as the physiological features of blooms interestingly almost all blooms could be divided into two clusters by these features i e early blooms from april to june and mature blooms from july to october based on pca according to the simulation results enough biomass had satisfied the requirements for surface bloom formation 20 chla μg l 1 in bloom affected area for early blooms physical processes of colony acted as the main features that differentiated bloom occurrence red circles in fig 4 the colony size of microcystis during early summer was comparatively small with an average of 120 μm being calculated by our model small size leads to a low capacity to overcome wind induced entrainment for staying on the water surface reynolds et al 2001 otten et al 2012 wu et al 2015 according to model simulation turbulence induced mixing velocity was much higher than buoyant velocity during early summer fig a6 a therefore early blooms were more sensitive to physical forcing with turbulence induced mixing and advection induced accumulation being important influences on surface accumulation and extension i e bloom area for mature blooms physiological processes i e biomass isp and density acted as the main features blue circles in fig 4 for mature bloom stages colony size increased with increasing biomass induced by cell division and cell adhesion by extracellular polymeric substances xiao et al 2017 average colony size of surface blooms was calculated as 300 μm in our model turbulence induced mixing velocity and buoyant velocity were comparable due to the stable water profile consequently enough large colonies could remain at the water surface as long as they had buoyant status the colony density from april to october was lower than the water density in our simulations facilitating persistent buoyancy however protracted exposure to high solar intensity at the water surface when water conditions were stable and colony size was large might lead to the formation of heavier colonies in late summer than in early summer fig a6 b this suggestion is consistent with the results obtained by wallace et al 2000 heavier colony density might lead to lower flotation velocity according to stokes law therefore buoyancy controlling strategies are required for mature bloom diversity hindcast simulations using our coupled model helped us to identify the contributions of these processes for instance as shown in fig 5 the importance of horizontal drift and buoyant velocity alternates with one another during whole bloom stage it is difficult to identify a single environmental variable that explains the timing intensity and area of all surface blooms that occurred in the shallow lake cca allowed us to classify the key environmental variables regulating the occurrence of early and late blooms sufficient biomass is the basis of surface scum paerl et al 2011a therefore light and temperature are important for biosynthesis in the early stages of bloom formation warmer water temperature and increasing global radiation which are related with climate change are the main factors controlling the growth of colonies and the initiation of blooms kanoshina et al 2003 zhang et al 2012 lake warming results in extra buoyancy that sustains blooms for longer and might be associated with vertical stratification according to model results nitrogen limitation emphasised the importance of din supporting the results of paerl et al 2011b paerl et al 2011b showed that nitrogen is an essential nutrient regulating the biomass of cyanobacteria in lake taihu for the mature bloom stage sustained suitable temperature and irradiation guaranteed the maintenance of sufficient biomass phosphorous limitation has been emphasized in mature stages supporting paerl et al 2011b the optimum temperature for microcystis in our calibrated model was set as 28 2 c temperatures that were too high in august were accompanied with smaller bloom area fig a6 c and fig a6 d in addition relatively lower radiation prevented colonies from forming high densities favouring their protracted retention on the water surface therefore there was a negative relationship between light and temperature with bloom occurrence during the mature bloom stage in cca wind is a very important forcing parameter for bloom formation and extension verhagen 1994 wu et al 2015 because of the general low wind speed during bloom events the importance of wind was weak in the cca however wind has a strong influence on both the physical and physiological processes of blooms which is discussed in following section therefore multiple environmental variables influence the formation of the different stages of bloom occurrence in the study shallow lake demonstrating its sensitivity to environmental change wind induced turbulence which produces the vmt of cyanobacteria has been emphasized by hindcast simulation in lake taihu turbulence has direct and indirect effects on bloom formation direct effects represent the entrainment of colonies within the vertical water column for early bloom stages as shown by the pca turbulent induced mixing velocity of colony has an important influence on the surface accumulation of colonies and then area extension indirect effects involve vertical mix causing agents to experience different light intensities within the mixed layer avoiding self contained buoyancy control when colonies are entrained into the mixed layer the loss of light decreases carbon fixation and hence ballast accumulation therefore colonies always maintain a buoyant status as shown in fig a6 b enhancing their ability to override vertical turbulence and allowing them to accumulate on the water surface when the wind ceased persistent buoyancy followed by bloom formation has been documented by previous studies wallace et al 2000 ma et al 2016 rowe et al 2016 in addition the transient response time τ r also helps to avoid the accumulation of too much ballast on the water surface wang et al 2017b without vertical mixing the vertical movement of colonies is only controlled by buoyancy controlling strategies to avoid becoming mixed in the deep layers however this phenomenon cannot be used to interpret the occurrence of monitored blooms at noon versus night time in deep lakes or reservoirs serizawa et al 2010 chien et al 2013 bloom 16 in fig 6 shows a general trend of smaller bloom area when vmt was excluded therefore we inferred that vmt is essential for maintaining the buoyancy of colonies and blooms over long periods in shallow lakes vmt can account for 52 9 of bloom formations as seen in fig 5 interestingly we can conduct a more in depth comparison of onshore offshore blooms through scenarios simulation along with the actual modis data the obvious downwind accumulation onshore bloom was caused by hdt mainly wind induced advection as seen in scenario b of bloom cases when only excluding isp colonies have poor capability to stay on water surface the offshore bloom could appear with the existence of vmt as seen in scenario c of bloom cases the wind entrainment can prevent the downwind movement according to our former study wang et al 2017b the net effect of increasing wind was shown to reduce horizontal transport therefore the turbulence induced mixing is critical for offshore bloom this finding is useful for understanding the distribution pattern of surface bloom in large domain in general our study provided in depth finding about the respective importance of physical and physiological feature of cyanobacteria for onshore offshore bloom formation at different stages the model was developed under the euler lagrangian coupled framework and used lake taihu as a case study this coupled model could be applied to other shallow lakes by adjusting input conditions and initial values of the super agent the shallow region of lake erie is approximately 5 m requiring a stronger wind to completely mix the water column therefore the fitness of our finding to this lake could be carefully tested by using our coupled model however possible limitation for transferability of the findings to other lake should also be discussed firstly our conclusion about the relative importance of physical and physiological features is only suitable for the shallow area without rooted aquatic vegetation such as missisquoi bay mean 2 8 m ndong et al 2017 and thomsons lake a shallow max depth 1 4 m flat bottomed lake wallace et al 2000 secondly our coupled model is fit for the microcystis dominated bloom the transferability to anabaena dominated hellweger et al 2008 or diatom dominated bloom is unfeasible 5 conclusions in this study we used satellite images as a data source and a coupled model as a form of technology to extract information on cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu china in particular we analysed bloom characteristics and their complex correlations with climatic variables the idea about the generation of onshore and offshore bloom was also evaluated by using scenarios analysis in hindcast simulation our study demonstrates that retrieving ecological information from agent based modelling is valuable for the large scale research of fresh water ecosystems despite parameter uncertainties and the complexity of aquatic systems our future work will focus on the identification of on set bloom for advanced bloom prevention which needs more long time remote sensing images coupled with elaborately integrated model such as wrf fvcom abm modeling system meanwhile shallow lakes are a complex system and the interaction between sediment and

19525,cyanobacterial blooms have emerged as one of the most severe ecological problems affecting large and shallow freshwater lakes to improve our understanding of the factors that influence and could be used to predict surface blooms this study developed a novel euler lagrangian coupled approach combining the eulerian model with agent based modelling abm the approach was subsequently verified based on monitoring datasets and modis data in a large shallow lake lake taihu china the eulerian model solves the eulerian variables and physiological parameters whereas abm generates the complete life cycle and transport processes of cyanobacterial colonies this model ensemble performed well in fitting historical data and predicting the dynamics of cyanobacterial biomass bloom distribution and area based on the calculated physical and physiological characteristics of surface blooms principal component analysis pca captured the major processes influencing surface bloom formation at different stages two bloom clusters early bloom outbreaks were influenced by physical processes horizontal transport and vertical turbulence induced mixing whereas buoyancy controlling strategies were essential for mature bloom outbreaks canonical correlation analysis cca revealed the combined actions of multiple environment variables on different bloom clusters the effects of buoyancy controlling strategies isp vertical turbulence induced mixing velocity of colony vmt and horizontal drift velocity of colony hdt were quantitatively compared using scenario simulations in the coupled model vmt accounted for 52 9 of bloom formations and maintained blooms over long periods thus demonstrating the importance of wind induced turbulence in shallow lakes in comparison hdt and buoyancy controlling strategies influenced blooms at different stages in conclusion the approach developed here presents a promising tool for understanding the processes of onshore offshore algal blooms formation and subsequent predicting graphical abstract image 1 keywords agent based model eulerian model microcystis blooms physiological process physical process 1 introduction as the third largest freshwater eutrophic lake in china lake taihu has been subject to harmful cyanobacterial blooms cyanohabs dominated by microcystis spp paerl and huisman 2008 because of excessive nutrient inputs to the lake these blooms present a serious threat to drinking water supplies aquatic life human health and the ecological sustainability of the freshwater ecosystem of this region a central question facing water researchers and managers is how to predict the spatial temporal pattern of surface blooms in large shallow lakes this question is of immense importance for estimating the risk of cyanobacterial occurrence in advance understanding the growth and transport process of microcystis is essential for resolving this question wynne et al 2013 previous studies have identified a host of physiological processes underlying the excessive in situ proliferation of microcystis colonies particularly from the perspective of biological responses such as nutrient induced over enrichment reynolds 2006 paerl et al 2011b photosynthesis takamura et al 1985 colony formation avoiding predation reynolds et al 1981 and buoyancy controlling strategies isp reynolds 1973 reynolds et al 1987 ndong et al 2017 in deep lakes the response to buoyancy changes would be on the order of days and stationary behavior reduce the chance to accumulation on water surface chien et al 2013 medrano et al 2013 therefore the occurrence of surface bloom in shallow lake is more sensitive to physical transport process within minute scale than that in deep lake wallace et al 2000 duan et al 2009 wang et al 2017 the physical transport processes of colony comprise of vertical turbulence induced mixing velocity vmt and horizontal drift speed hdt wu et al 2015 and cao et al 2006 emphasized the strong relationship between surface bloom formation and wind induced turbulence in lake taihu china the impacts of wind induced surface drift and wave induced stokes drift on offshore onshore bloom migration have been increasingly acknowledged ishikawa et al 2002 wu et al 2010 deng et al 2016 hua et al 2016 in addition buoyancy control and vertical transport processes have been also observed to interact wallace and hamilton 1999 wallace et al 2000 recently differences in morphology as a result of different growth environments which influence colony size have been shown to contribute to diverse transport patterns deng et al 2016 therefore both physiological process especially isp and physical processes vmt and hdt should be evaluated to understand the timing and intensity of specific surface blooms glibert et al 2010 otten et al 2012 however few studies and technologies have integrated these nonlinear complex and interactive processes or compared their respective contributions in shallow lakes using field data to demonstrate the spatial temporal distribution of surface cyanobacterial blooms presents a considerable challenge furthermore linking this information to bio physical changes is even more problematic recently satellite imagery such as modis data has been used to detect the spatiotemporal patterns of surface bloom areas over large domains relating these patterns to changing environmental conditions wynne et al 2011 qin et al 2015 however the information acquired from satellite imagery might obscure microcystis adaptive migratory movement patterns buoyancy controlling strategy as such patterns are three dimensional induced by water current and or wind especially in shallow lakes different responses of growth to variation in light temperature and nutrient levels across seasons must also be considered thus numerical techniques might be required to complement satellite data agent based models abm have been widely applied to capture 2 d and 3 d transport trajectories of cyanobacteria over periods of several days dippner et al 2011 wynne et al 2011 2013 henrichs et al 2015 most abm models are forced with the physical environment from an eulerian model allowing the agents each representing certain cyanobacteria to drift around thus experiencing different biological processes with water quality variables in abm models the system properties are said to emerge from the properties of the individual particles grimm and railsback 2005 both individual physiological properties and physical drivers could be easily integrated into agent based equations to describe complex ecological processes as described in hellweger et al 2008 and glibert et al 2010 however the calibration of phytoplankton parameters in abm is difficult because of the enormous computation requirements therefore the preliminary calibrated euler based physical biological model which describes the concentration of the distribution of cumulative individuals should be integrated into abm to obtain associated physiological parameters of cyanobacteria and water quality variables the increasingly complex euler based ecological models help us to capture the response of ecological systems to the external environment butenschön et al 2016 rolighed et al 2016 the fortran based framework for aquatic biogeochemical models fabm was developed by bruggeman and bolding 2014 in which the biochemical model was arbitrarily connected to a physical model here we combined a self contained complex biological model called gem to a well known hydrodynamic model fvcom by fabm this euler based model was used to calibrate the physiological parameters for phytoplankton in lake taihu in china algae begin to emerge from the sediment and aggregate to form the early blooming stage april june before mass propagation during the mature blooming stage july october when the water temperature is persistently high kong and fao 2005 cao and yang 2010 therefore we assumed that the blooms detected at different stages have specific physiological and physical characteristics in the present study we improved the original agent based model of wang et al 2017b and tested our hypothesis furthermore we evaluated the performance of the coupled euler lagrangian model using field investigated data and modis data to demonstrate our ability to reproduce the spatial patterns of algal blooms and characterize the physiological and physical variables of blooms we also used the coupled model to simulate several scenarios and identify the individual contributions of physiological processes and physical processes of microcystis to surface bloom in the shallow lake system our results are expected to provide new insights on the parameters that drive algal blooms thus providing a basis on which to predict onshore offshore blooms in such a large domain 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lake taihu 30 55ʹ40ʺ 31 32ʹ58ʺ n 119 52ʹ32ʺ 120 36ʹ10ʺ e is located in the lower part of the yangtze river delta china it is a well known large shallow and eutrophic lake fig 1 lake taihu covers an area of about 2338 km2 with an average depth of 1 9 m and maximum depth of 2 64 m severe cyanobacterial blooms occur between april and october hu et al 2006 the cyanobacteria are primarily microcystis spp which is a colony forming cyanobacterial species consisting of mucilage gas vesicles and cells qin et al 2015 therefore the physiological and physical processes of microcystis were chosen to represent that of all the cyanobacterial species in this study mlb 31 4929 n 120 2074 e represents the validation site for the eulerian model 2 2 model overview we modified a type of model ensemble referred to as an eulerian abm hybrid in wang et al 2017b in this study the eulerian model call as gem was improved with ecological processes by fabm to consider the feedback between nutrient field and physical structure and proliferation of cyanobacteria physiological consideration of three phytoplankton species diatom chlorophytes and cyanobacteria has been included into eulerian model neither zooplankton nor fish was considered in our coupled model abm focuses on the physiological and physical characteristic of cyanobacteria i e microcystis and models the formation of surface bloom the abm model is a particle based framework that describes the agent based representation of microcystis each agent has its own upscaling number that specifies the number of colonies that it represents and the colony number in agent keeps constant during simulation the biological processes of microcystis in these two models were the same overall the eulerian models were run first during each time step followed by the abm models allowing the eulerian variables nutrient and detritus to interact with physiological growth carbon and intracellular nutrient content of microcystis as shown in the schematic of gem fig a2 then the calculated physical field such as temperature and chemical field such as dissolved nutrient from eulerian model were directly forced to modify agent physiology such as biomass and colony size and transport pattern in abm meanwhile the preliminary euler based physical biological model supplied associated physiological parameters for abm details of this coupled model including parameters equations concepts of agent summary of agents are provided in the supporting information here we provide a brief description of the agent based model the variables of the microcystis agent and related parameters are presented in table 1 and table a1 respectively 2 2 1 biological processes of the agent the intracellular biomass in individual agent changes as a function of limited growth and death 1 d p c d t μ p μ d p c where p c g c agent 1 is the agent biomass i e agent size the chlorophyll a of agent could be acquired by multiplying p c by a fixed ratio δ c h l a c which is easier for monitoring and model calibration μ p d 1 is the specific proliferation rate of agent biomass i e physiological growth of agent and μ d d 1 is the mortality rate for simplicity the mortality rate which affects carbon content and therefore buoyancy includes respiration excretion and predation loss details about biological processes can be seen in section s3 3 supporting information 2 2 2 transport processes of the agent in the original abm transport equations advection and wind induced mixing terms were included along with the surface wind drift on surface scum under low wind conditions when the wind speed exceeded a critical value approximately 3 m s webster and hutchinson 1994 and even though surface cyanobacterial cells tended to be distributed in the deeper layer they were still transported by stokes drift generated by wind induced waves hua et al 2016 therefore the optimized pyhsical dynamics of the cyanobacterial communities is 2 x i t δ t x i t u d t u a d d i t i o n a l d t ξ t 2 d h i t δ t 3 y i t δ t y i t v d t v a d d i t i o n a l d t ξ t 2 d h i t δ t 4 z i t δ t z i t w s d t d v z i t d t ξ t 2 d v z δ t where x y and z are the agent locations u and v are the passive current induced horizontal velocity terms and w s is the buoyancy controlling velocity i e isp d h represents the horizontal dispersion coefficients l2 t 1 ξ t is an independent normally distributed random variable with zero mean and unit variance the second and third terms on the right hand side of eq 2 and eq 3 represent horizontal displacement of agent i e hdt for the third and fourth terms on the right hand side of eq 4 we chose the visser 1997 scheme as the random walk vertical mixing scheme to describe the vertical turbulence induced displacement of colonies i e vmt d v l2 t 1 is the vertical diffusivity and d v d v dz is the vertical gradient of d v z z i t 1 2 d v z i t δ t is the vertical position that is displaced as a function of the diffusivity gradient the details about surface wind drift and wave induced stokes drift can be seen in section s3 3 5 supporting information w s the buoyancy controlling velocity termed isp is the adaptive biological trait of microcystis for higher growth rate this adaptive behaviour was estimated using a modified stokes law which reproduced the observed vertical behaviour of floating up or down we calculated an equilibrium speed of the agent which was related to density

information as carbon content of agent increasing the diameter of colony in each agent increased g is the acceleration due to gravity ϑ is the viscosity of water and ρ c o l and ρ w are the density of the microcystis colony and the water respectively in this version the non linear drag was added on stokes drag coefficient to avoid the over predicted rising sinking velocity of large colonies 400 μm

relationship between speed and drag in previous studies density changes were incorporated as a function of light regime without considering the influences of temperature and nutrients at an annual scale thus the density equations used here were those of rabouille et al 2005 in which the fluctuations of colony density resulted from the dynamics of carbohydrate reserve metabolism see section s3 3 6 supporting information 2 3 data acquisition and statistical analysis every 3 h meteorological data were downloaded from http www meteomanz com the discharge and water quality data such as nitrogen phosphorus and detritus of inflow rivers around lakes were collected from 2008 to 2009 the monthly surface at depths of 0 5 m biomass of microcystis were recorded in meiliang bay which is the bloom influenced domain of the lake fig 1 in eulerian model the simulated results of temperature cyanobacteria biomass and nutrient concentration were compared with these measured data in the supporting information the calibration and validation period of eulerian module are in 2008 and 2009 respectively to detect the appearance of blooms in this large lake cyanobacterial bloom events were obtained from satellite images from april to october in 2008 a total of 20 treated remote sensing images modis were obtained from the lake watershed science data center national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science technology infrastructure of china http lake geodata cn the treated remote sensing images only demonstrate the spatial bloom distribution green color on water surface without information about chlorophyll a concentration a bloom case is assumed to be detected in remote sensing images when chlorophyll a c h a excced 20 μg l qin et al 2015 in abm the cumulative effect of all the agents was considered when calculating the mass budget from agent pools p c to the concentration for bloom detection the local mesh will be dyed to green such as a series of pictures in fig 3b when calculated c h a in surface layer exceeds 20 μg l the abm based model skill assessments were conducted using a binary categorical variable bloom or no bloom by comparing pixel by pixel the modelled bloom map with remote sensing observations the skill assessment statistics of rowe et al 2016 was applied in this study the frequency bias b gives the ratio of the number of forecasts of occurrence to the number of observed occurrences 6 b a b a c where the number of a correctly predicted events hits b false events false alarms c false negatives misses and d correct non events an unbiased forecast has a frequency bias b 1 0 the pierce skill score p s s gives the hit rate minus the false alarm rate 7 p s s a d b c a d b c p s s ranges from 1 0 to 1 0 with positive values indicating that the hit rate was greater than the false positive rate thus the model had acceptable skills the pixel setting and skill assessment were achieved by matlab programming details provided in the section s4 supporting information a principal component analysis pca was conducted to cluster the bloom events based on different types of characteristics of blooms five characteristics have been used in pca i e biomass pc colony density ρ col turbulence induced mixing velocity of colony vmt horizontal drift velocity of colony hdt and buoyancy controlling velocity of colony isp analysis of similarities anosim which is a non parametric statistical method was used to test the significant difference between clusters canonical correlation analysis cca was performed to determine the relationship between significant environmental variables and bloom composition wang et al 2017a wind speed light water temperature nutrients din and dip and water level were used for significant environmental variables in cca the surface bloom characteristic describes bloom composition the surface bloom characteristic in cca represented all of the associated auxiliary processes of microcystis calculated in abm model the associated auxiliary processes contained carbohydrate reserve process intracellular nutrient uptake rate growth rate mortality rate hdt vmt and so on pca anosim and cca analyses were carried out using r 3 4 0 software 2 4 model application 2 4 1 model evaluation the calibration and validation of the eulerian model with cyanobacteria biomass are presented in section s1 and section s2 supporting information which supply associated physiological parameters and water quality variables for the following abm a certain number of particles were released at the beginning of the simulation in each water covered mesh excluding the plant covered meshes the collection of agents and implementation of abm are shown in section s3 and s4 supporting information we then ran the abm to produce a one year simulation output at hourly intervals to evaluate the model performance bloom coverage in surface layer of local mesh against detected 20 bloom mapping pixel by pixel the cell centred tracer control elements were used as control volumes for converting total agent size to the concentration of chlorophyll a chla 2 4 2 hindcast simulation based on the established model numerical scenarios were conducted to separate the influence of physiological and physical processes of microcystis colonies on surface bloom formation to identify the individual contribution of isp vmt and hdt on the occurrence of cyanohabs we carried out four groups of scenarios which are shown in table 2 the individual components of isp vmt and hdt were embodied or neglected by abm for the entire annual simulation all scenarios were conducted with the same external boundaries and model parameters c0 was the calculated concentration which should be validated against the field investigated data the differences between the calculated results of each scenario and c0 indicate individual contributions for all scenarios the biological processes which describe the growth and death of agents were included this simple additive method can quantify the relative importance among different factors although interaction between factors exists 3 results 3 1 summary of skill statistics of the model ensemble our previous paper showed that 1 d random walk simulations reasonably approximate the changing vertical distributions of microcystis colonies in response to varying turbulence in the current study we advanced this work to test whether the inclusion of biological process in the coupled model could be utilized to predict the occurrence of spatial blooms in a large shallow lake fig 2a shows the statistical value of biomass calibration in the eulerian model whereas fig 2b shows the time series of biomass concentration the time and intensity of biomass peak was well captured whereas the deviation of the modelled and measured values during the period of calibration and validation was acceptable fig 2 the calibration and statistical evaluation of other water quality variables are presented in section s2 supporting information the frequency bias b and pierce skill pss of 20 scenarios during april to october are shown in fig 3a for the 2008 simulation the pierce skill score pss produced positive values in all cases positive values of pss indicate that the model was more effective than a random forecast or constant bloom or no bloom prediction hogan and mason 2012 the frequency bias remained within a reasonable range the frequency bias was larger than 1 0 for 13 out of the 20 scenarios indicating an overall bias towards over prediction for simulations 11 12 13 and 15 large frequency bias represented oversized simulated blooms both indicators showed that our abm model performed well in most cases to test whether the model was able to match the observed spatially varying bloom coverage by modis pixel by pixel comparison of a selected simulation day for one scenario per month was conducted fig 3b fig 3b compared the number of pixels that are flagged as likely having cyanobacterial blooms the critical wind intensity for bloom formation in lake taihu is 3 2 m s cao et al 2006 large bloom coverage was detected on 19 may which was a calm day wind 1 2 m s with intense events throughout the western region b 1 19 pss 0 6374 the calm wind coupled with enough biomass seen in fig 3b contributed to this phenomenon in the following scenario in june wind increased to 4 m s and both modis and model indicated reduced surface bloom intensity b 1 11 pss 0 2565 164 5 km2 in simulation 11 27 july and simulation 13 26 aug wind speed decreased to 2 4 m s and oversized simulated bloom coverages were depicted in the western region b 1 8359 and 1 4637 respectively in simulation 16 18 september optimum water temperature contributed to the peak in biomass fig 3b a subsequent easterly calm wind 2 4 m s caused the surface bloom to expand 500 km2 toward the north westerly part of the lake b 1 0807 pss 0 596 unfortunately the emergence of blooms in meiliang bay were missed in our model on 14 oct simulation 19 a persistent easterly wind 1 2 m s induced a severe bloom outbreak in the entire area of meiliang bay which was captured by our coupled model the performance of coupled model for bloom size was acceptable as seen in fig 3c comparison of spatial simulation results and detected bloom mapping for all 20 modis images are shown in fig a7 therefore the changing map and size of bloom over long time scale from april to october were successfully captured in most cases although over prediction exists overall both the skill assessment and pixel comparison showed that our coupled model was able to simulate changing surface blooms in response to changing current wind induced movement and physiological status of microcystis 3 2 statistical analysis of bloom characteristics and relationship with environmental conditions our coupled model could record the physiological value of surface blooms such as biomass colony density and isp while also capturing temporally varying physical value of blooms as vmt and hdt therefore these five variables were used to distinguish 20 sets of surface microcystis blooms in pca when data from the modelled results within the lake were analysed by pca ordination the bloom community formed two clusters fig 4a the first three principal components axis1 axis2 and axis3 explained 37 5 25 28 and 23 16 of total variance respectively thirteen of the simulated blooms red circles in fig 4a were clustered in one community and were strongly associated with vmt and hdt of surface microcystis the other seven simulated blooms blue circles in fig 4a were clustered as a single separate community which was strongly associated with biomass density and isp the p value which calculated by anosim equaled 0 017 the low p value demonstrated the significant difference between two clusters the former cluster primarily contained blooms from april to june except for bloom 19 and bloom 20 whereas the latter cluster contained blooms from july to october cca was used to analyse the relationship of environmental conditions with bloom composition fig 4b the cca model accounted for 48 1 of variation in the bloom composition data the first two axes explained up to 37 67 axis 1 and 10 31 axis 2 of variation the variables that were most strongly correlated with these axes were din light and water temperature as shown by the arrows length in fig 4b similarly the first axis of the cca separated the communities of early bloom events left part of the graph from late bloom events right part of the graph early blooms were associated with abundant din high solar radiation and high temperature mature blooms were positively associated with water level and dip and were negatively associated with light and temperature additionally wind during bloom period with shortest arrow length explained the least variation 3 3 contribution of physiological and physical processes to bloom formation the results of hindcast simulations carried out within whole lake were analyzed to assess the contribution of hdt isp and vmt to surface scum area during different bloom stages fig 5 during early bloom stage hdt and vmt account for bloom occurrences 33 3 and 43 3 respectively otherwise isp has the least influence on bloom area extension 29 8 as time goes on vmt and isp control 82 4 of bloom formation 55 1 and 27 3 respectively however the importance of hdt decreases to 17 6 overall vertical turbulence induced mixing had the largest impact on bloom formation during the whole bloom stage in the shallow lake results of scenarios analysis for all 20 bloom cases are shown in fig a8 smaller even no area of bloom happened for most cases when turbulence induced mixing velocity of agent vmt was excluded an example of a spatial distribution map bloom 16 was used to reflect the importance of vmt fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of surface blooms under different scenarios at 11 17 on 18 september 2008 scenario a shows the baseline of the simulation considering all hdt vmt and isp a large section of the bloom approximately 500 km2 was simulated in the northern part of the lake scenario b shows the modelled results when considering only hdt colonies always remained at the depth at which they were released a bloom was only detected in the southwestern near shore region of the lake scenario c shows a larger bloom area in the northern region when only excluding isp interestingly scenario d shows no blooms occurring in any part of the lake when only vmt was excluded from the abm model 4 discussion cyanobacterial blooms occur as a result of the proliferation and migration of cyanobacteria because of the complex interaction between active physiological induced growth and passive physical induced transport a hybrid of eulerian and agent based methods represents a useful tool for resolving this non linear problem the eulerian model incorporated fvom fabm and gem the previously calibrated fvom part of the model provided hydrodynamic forcing such as water current temperature profile and turbulence diffusivity for each super individual in a local mesh in addition the validated physiological parameters which are conveyed as biological processes in abm are also supplied by fabm gem to avoid high computation costs to capture the spatial temporal position of microcystis accurately we added growth responses wave generated stokes drift and carbohydrate reserve metabolism based on our original agent based model wang et al 2017b we then confirmed that the spatial comparison between the hybrid model results with modis and sampling data followed the actual pattern in the distribution of cyanobacteria from a small colony to surface scum along with horizontal or vertical transport the rigorous verification process used in this study confirmed that our approach which incorporated the physiological characteristics of surface cyanobacteria was able to reflect bloom events under different environmental conditions most published papers have analysed the occurrence or characteristics of blooms using simple linear analysis between bloom area and or biomass with potential explanatory variables such as wind and temperature zhu et al 2014 wu et al 2015 however the relationship between environmental variables and bloom events is indirect and non linear the specific characteristics of surface blooms such as growth rate vertical velocity and density have been consistently overlooked in the analyses of previous studies this issue might lead to the understanding of physical and physiological processes that regulate blooms at different times being incomplete therefore multivariate statistical analysis was used to disentangle the relationship between bloom events and the specific characteristics of surface blooms based on auxiliary information provided by the coupled model horizontal transport speed hdt mainly wind induced and passive vertical speed vmt turbulence induced mixing of surface microcystis blooms were used as the physical features of formed surface scum biomass pc colony density and buoyant velocity isp were used as the physiological features of blooms interestingly almost all blooms could be divided into two clusters by these features i e early blooms from april to june and mature blooms from july to october based on pca according to the simulation results enough biomass had satisfied the requirements for surface bloom formation 20 chla μg l 1 in bloom affected area for early blooms physical processes of colony acted as the main features that differentiated bloom occurrence red circles in fig 4 the colony size of microcystis during early summer was comparatively small with an average of 120 μm being calculated by our model small size leads to a low capacity to overcome wind induced entrainment for staying on the water surface reynolds et al 2001 otten et al 2012 wu et al 2015 according to model simulation turbulence induced mixing velocity was much higher than buoyant velocity during early summer fig a6 a therefore early blooms were more sensitive to physical forcing with turbulence induced mixing and advection induced accumulation being important influences on surface accumulation and extension i e bloom area for mature blooms physiological processes i e biomass isp and density acted as the main features blue circles in fig 4 for mature bloom stages colony size increased with increasing biomass induced by cell division and cell adhesion by extracellular polymeric substances xiao et al 2017 average colony size of surface blooms was calculated as 300 μm in our model turbulence induced mixing velocity and buoyant velocity were comparable due to the stable water profile consequently enough large colonies could remain at the water surface as long as they had buoyant status the colony density from april to october was lower than the water density in our simulations facilitating persistent buoyancy however protracted exposure to high solar intensity at the water surface when water conditions were stable and colony size was large might lead to the formation of heavier colonies in late summer than in early summer fig a6 b this suggestion is consistent with the results obtained by wallace et al 2000 heavier colony density might lead to lower flotation velocity according to stokes law therefore buoyancy controlling strategies are required for mature bloom diversity hindcast simulations using our coupled model helped us to identify the contributions of these processes for instance as shown in fig 5 the importance of horizontal drift and buoyant velocity alternates with one another during whole bloom stage it is difficult to identify a single environmental variable that explains the timing intensity and area of all surface blooms that occurred in the shallow lake cca allowed us to classify the key environmental variables regulating the occurrence of early and late blooms sufficient biomass is the basis of surface scum paerl et al 2011a therefore light and temperature are important for biosynthesis in the early stages of bloom formation warmer water temperature and increasing global radiation which are related with climate change are the main factors controlling the growth of colonies and the initiation of blooms kanoshina et al 2003 zhang et al 2012 lake warming results in extra buoyancy that sustains blooms for longer and might be associated with vertical stratification according to model results nitrogen limitation emphasised the importance of din supporting the results of paerl et al 2011b paerl et al 2011b showed that nitrogen is an essential nutrient regulating the biomass of cyanobacteria in lake taihu for the mature bloom stage sustained suitable temperature and irradiation guaranteed the maintenance of sufficient biomass phosphorous limitation has been emphasized in mature stages supporting paerl et al 2011b the optimum temperature for microcystis in our calibrated model was set as 28 2 c temperatures that were too high in august were accompanied with smaller bloom area fig a6 c and fig a6 d in addition relatively lower radiation prevented colonies from forming high densities favouring their protracted retention on the water surface therefore there was a negative relationship between light and temperature with bloom occurrence during the mature bloom stage in cca wind is a very important forcing parameter for bloom formation and extension verhagen 1994 wu et al 2015 because of the general low wind speed during bloom events the importance of wind was weak in the cca however wind has a strong influence on both the physical and physiological processes of blooms which is discussed in following section therefore multiple environmental variables influence the formation of the different stages of bloom occurrence in the study shallow lake demonstrating its sensitivity to environmental change wind induced turbulence which produces the vmt of cyanobacteria has been emphasized by hindcast simulation in lake taihu turbulence has direct and indirect effects on bloom formation direct effects represent the entrainment of colonies within the vertical water column for early bloom stages as shown by the pca turbulent induced mixing velocity of colony has an important influence on the surface accumulation of colonies and then area extension indirect effects involve vertical mix causing agents to experience different light intensities within the mixed layer avoiding self contained buoyancy control when colonies are entrained into the mixed layer the loss of light decreases carbon fixation and hence ballast accumulation therefore colonies always maintain a buoyant status as shown in fig a6 b enhancing their ability to override vertical turbulence and allowing them to accumulate on the water surface when the wind ceased persistent buoyancy followed by bloom formation has been documented by previous studies wallace et al 2000 ma et al 2016 rowe et al 2016 in addition the transient response time τ r also helps to avoid the accumulation of too much ballast on the water surface wang et al 2017b without vertical mixing the vertical movement of colonies is only controlled by buoyancy controlling strategies to avoid becoming mixed in the deep layers however this phenomenon cannot be used to interpret the occurrence of monitored blooms at noon versus night time in deep lakes or reservoirs serizawa et al 2010 chien et al 2013 bloom 16 in fig 6 shows a general trend of smaller bloom area when vmt was excluded therefore we inferred that vmt is essential for maintaining the buoyancy of colonies and blooms over long periods in shallow lakes vmt can account for 52 9 of bloom formations as seen in fig 5 interestingly we can conduct a more in depth comparison of onshore offshore blooms through scenarios simulation along with the actual modis data the obvious downwind accumulation onshore bloom was caused by hdt mainly wind induced advection as seen in scenario b of bloom cases when only excluding isp colonies have poor capability to stay on water surface the offshore bloom could appear with the existence of vmt as seen in scenario c of bloom cases the wind entrainment can prevent the downwind movement according to our former study wang et al 2017b the net effect of increasing wind was shown to reduce horizontal transport therefore the turbulence induced mixing is critical for offshore bloom this finding is useful for understanding the distribution pattern of surface bloom in large domain in general our study provided in depth finding about the respective importance of physical and physiological feature of cyanobacteria for onshore offshore bloom formation at different stages the model was developed under the euler lagrangian coupled framework and used lake taihu as a case study this coupled model could be applied to other shallow lakes by adjusting input conditions and initial values of the super agent the shallow region of lake erie is approximately 5 m requiring a stronger wind to completely mix the water column therefore the fitness of our finding to this lake could be carefully tested by using our coupled model however possible limitation for transferability of the findings to other lake should also be discussed firstly our conclusion about the relative importance of physical and physiological features is only suitable for the shallow area without rooted aquatic vegetation such as missisquoi bay mean 2 8 m ndong et al 2017 and thomsons lake a shallow max depth 1 4 m flat bottomed lake wallace et al 2000 secondly our coupled model is fit for the microcystis dominated bloom the transferability to anabaena dominated hellweger et al 2008 or diatom dominated bloom is unfeasible 5 conclusions in this study we used satellite images as a data source and a coupled model as a form of technology to extract information on cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu china in particular we analysed bloom characteristics and their complex correlations with climatic variables the idea about the generation of onshore and offshore bloom was also evaluated by using scenarios analysis in hindcast simulation our study demonstrates that retrieving ecological information from agent based modelling is valuable for the large scale research of fresh water ecosystems despite parameter uncertainties and the complexity of aquatic systems our future work will focus on the identification of on set bloom for advanced bloom prevention which needs more long time remote sensing images coupled with elaborately integrated model such as wrf fvcom abm modeling system meanwhile shallow lakes are a complex system and the interaction between sediment and water was not presented in our model but will be considered in subsequent studies acknowledgments we are grateful for the grants for project supported by the key program of national natural science

19526,the transportation and sedimentation of particulate phosphorus pp in a huge reservoir such as the three gorges reservoir tgr are closely related to the phosphorus distribution characteristics and nutritional status of the water body in this study the pp distribution sedimentation and bioavailability in the mainstream section of the tgr were investigated through a field survey indoor simulated settlement experiment and historical data analysis the results indicated that pp was the major component of the total phosphorus tp and that the three gorges dam tgd trapped nearly 76 25 of suspended sediment ss and 75 35 of pp in the tgr even during the flood season a decline in flow velocity promoted the deposition of pp additionally pp concentrations gradually dropped from 0 35 mg l in chongqing to 0 02 mg l in zigui the static pp sedimentation process adequately fitted a pseudo second order kinetic equation with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0 97 moreover more than half of the pp sedimentation process was achieved in less than 60 min for samples collected from the upper river reaches within simulated sedimentation process the median particle size of ss and absolute value of the water column s zeta potential were negatively and positively related to the t 1 2 values of pp sedimentation respectively compared with the concentration and particle size of ss obtained in the pre tgr period the values in the mainstream section of the tgr were lower however the tp and fe al p contents in ss increased several times due to the combined effects of flow velocity reduction and ss trapping the water transparency and bioavailability of water column phosphorus were enhanced thus the risk of water bloom outburst significantly increased when the impounded water level of 175 m in the tgr became the normal state graphical abstract image keywords three gorges reservoir tgr suspended sediment ss particulate phosphorus pp sedimentation water bloom 1 introduction the three gorges dam tgd located in the upper mainstream section of the changjiang river is the world s largest water conservancy and hydroelectric project fu et al 2010 the three gorges reservoir tgr spreads across the reach of the changjiang river between jiangjin of the city of chongqing and yichang of hubei province with a total water surface area of 1 08 103 km2 and a storage capacity of 39 3 billion cubic meters wang et al 2013 to investigate and mitigate the potential negative impacts of this huge reservoir operation on the ecological environment a staged impoundment scheme has been adopted for the tgr three major stages of the impoundment scheme were completed in 2003 2006 and 2010 by raising the storage level up to 135 156 and 175 m respectively wang et al 2013 therefore since 2010 tgr has been fully operational with the water level fluctuating between 145 m in the wet season from april to september and 175 m in the dry season from october to mid april sediment deposition and eutrophication were considered as the two major problems to be solved during the post tgr period nevertheless effective traps set by the upstream large cascade reservoirs including xiangjiaba and xiluodu along with appropriate water and soil conservation measures mao et al 2012 cao et al 2011 reduced sediment input and solved the sediment deposition challenge to a great extent however a water bloom immediately occurred in nearly 10 of the associated tributaries and bays such as the xiangxi river in which the water was first impounded to a level of 135 m in 2003 zhang et al 2012 since 2010 the water in the tgr has been normally been impounded to a level of 175 m moreover a decline in the flow velocity and increase in the water transparency and soluble nutrient content may have caused the frequent outburst of water blooms on a larger water surface area phosphorus has already been identified as the nutrient element responsible for eutrophication in the tgr zhang et al 2012 wu et al 2016 han et al 2018 in a reservoir ecosystem phosphorus is mostly stored in environmental media including water suspended sediment ss and bed sediment bs for the tgr researchers have mostly conducted studies to understand the status and mechanism of phosphorus storage in water and bs and have focused on the sources of phosphorus sinks of phosphorus interactions of phosphorus with sediment and consequences of increased phosphorus concentrations such as eutrophication in the mainstream and its tributaries huang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 few studies have reported the impacts of dam retention of ss on particulate phosphorus pp transportation obvious retentions of pp were observed due to ss trapping yao et al 2009 han et al 2018 found that the pp concentration showed a decreasing trend from the tail area to the head area of the tgr because of particle deposition along the four mainstream sections pp serves a key role in regulating water transparency and balancing the inorganic phosphate flux in the water column however no detailed study has been conducted to understand the spatial distribution of pp in the front and back sections of the dam understanding this distribution may help to reveal the factors involved in contributing to pp deposition and retention in the tgd ss is the most important carrier of pp because it can buffer dissolved inorganic phosphate through particle adsorption pan et al 2002 the appearance of dam induced hydrological variations greatly affected the transport and transformation of phosphorus in the reservoir miller 2012 in the tgr the fate of pp is closely related to the ss transportation process nearly 98 4 of the total sediment in the tgr has been transported in the form of ss moreover 90 of the total ss transportation occurred during the flood season and the particle size for 50 of the ss ranged from 0 008 to 0 063 mm mao et al 2012 compared with the pre tgr period ss input loads and particle size both tended to decline during the post tgr period annual loads and mean particle size for ss entering the tgr decreased by 56 and 18 respectively between 2003 and 2010 compared with the values in the 1990s mao et al 2012 crwc 2000 2016 moreover water impoundment to a level of 175 m reduced the average flow velocity to between 0 09 and 2 43 m s which was much lower than that between 3 and 5 m s observed in natural river channels cnemc 1998 2016 impoundment obviously changed the hydrodynamic conditions for ss transportation however the related effects of impoundment on pp distribution and sedimentation in the tgr are still unknown in the tgr fine silt was reported to contain a higher amount of phosphorus than coarse sand because fine particles tend to adsorb a greater amount of dissolved phosphorus additionally the pp content in ss ranged between 1 04 and 1 52 mg g which was 30 higher than that contained in bs han et al 2018 pp was the dominant contributor to the phosphorus in bs a previous study found the total phosphorus budget in the tgr to be 65 685 and 43 684 t a during the pre and post impoundment periods respectively with upstream river inputs accounting for 93 and 84 respectively ran et al 2009 in general pp bounded to ss has a much higher bioavailability than that bounded to bs bioavailable fractions including exchangeable phosphorus ex p fe bounded phosphorus fe p and extractable organic phosphorus org p accounted for 42 53 of the total phosphorus tp content in the inner regions of the tgr han et al 2018 compared with the upstream input sediment release contributed less than 0 098 a negligible amount to the phosphorus in the tgr niu et al 2013 however from 2003 to 2010 when the impounded water level increased from 135 to 156 and 175m the sediment deposition volume of the tgr dramatically increased from 0 55 to 0 66 and 1 20 billion cubic meters respectively changjiang water resource commission cwrc 2000 2016 clearly impoundment to 175 m engendered a considerably large amount of ss as well as pp deposition in the tgr nevertheless little information is available concerning the variation in phosphorus bioavailability due to uncertain change of ss in the post tgr period as compared with the pre tgr period impoundment causes unbalanced water sediment and nutrient transportation in the changjiang river consequently the distribution sedimentation and bioavailability of pp is effected in the tgr in this study ss samples were collected during the flood season from 11 sections that were mainly located in the mainstream section of the tgr this study had the following objectives to understand the effects of dam retention on pp storage and distribution along the mainstream section of the tgr explore the characteristics of pp sedimentation by using a simulated settlement experiment examine the variation in ss transportation and bioavailability of pp between the pre and post tgr periods the findings of this study can improve the understanding of ss and pp transportation behavior after the tgr entered its full operating mode in addition to providing scientific evidence of the effects of impoundment on trophic status evolution and eutrophication control in the tgr 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and measurement in july 2017 surface water and ss samples 0 5 m below the water surface were collected at 11 representative sites fig 1 among these sites 10 namely chongqing cq changshou cs fuling fl zhongxian zx yunyang yy fengjie fj wushan ws badong bd xiangxi xx and zigui zg were in front of the tgd whereas 1 namely yichang yc was behind the tgd in the mainstream section of the changjiang river cq cs fl zx yy fj ws bd xx and zg were 619 1 538 1 489 2 370 2 252 2 169 3 124 3 76 4 31 and 2 5 km from the tgd whereas yc was 34 8 km behind the tgd water samples 200 ml were collected using precleaned polyethylene bottles several drops of chloroform were added to inhibit bacterial activity approximately 80 ml of the water samples was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter and then stored at 4 c the residual unfiltered water samples were also stored at 4 c during the sampling period ph water temperature dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec redox potential and turbidity were field measured with a portable meter ysi proplus usa transparency and flow velocity were also field determined for each sampling site by using a secchi disc and direct reading current meter global water respectively the ss content was calculated by filtering the samples through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter and then drying them at 105 c in an oven as the weight of particulate matter all water samples were immediately measured when they arrived at the laboratory the filtered water was analyzed for total dissolved phosphorus tdp and zeta potential the zeta potential was determined using a zetasizer nanoseries malvern instruments ltd the unfiltered water samples were used to detect the soluble reactive phosphorus srp and tp after 2 h of digestion with potassium persulfate in an autoclave tdp and tp as well as srp without digestion were measured by the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method apha 1998 the total pp in water means dissolved phosphorus bounded to the water column particles which was assumed to be equivalent to the difference between the tp and tdp surface water samples 30 l for each sampling site were filtered through six 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filters by using vacuum filtration the particles accumulated on the filter were naturally air dried carefully separated and stored in dry conditions ss particles approximately 0 01 g were dissolved and fully mixed in 10 ml pure water subsequently the mixture was used to determine the particle size distribution with a horiba 950v2 laser diffraction particle size analyzer sequential extraction of phosphorus was conducted to determine the phosphorus species in ss in accordance with the standards measurements and testing protocol ruban et al 2001 the dried 0 1 g ss particles were filled into a 50 ml centrifuge tube subsequently ex p fe and al oxide bound phosphorus fe p and al p respectively and calcium bound phosphorus ca p were extracted with 1 mol l nh4cl naoh and hcl respectively the tp content consisted of the p bounded to particle s external surface and p contained in its inner mineral components which was determined by exposing the original particles to 450 c followed by hcl extraction ruban et al 2001 org p was estimated to be the difference between tp and the sum of ex p fe p or al p and ca p 2 2 simulated static sedimentation experiments revealing the sedimentation process of ss and pp is challenging due to the complicated hydrodynamic conditions e g varied flow velocity great water depth wide cross section and complex underwater topography in the tgr however understanding the ss and pp sedimentation performance in stagnant water bodies through a simulated static sedimentation experiment is necessary and reasonable approximately 20 l surface water was collected to conduct the sedimentation experiment several drops of chloroform were added to inhibit bacterial activity the surface water was adequately but moderately shaken as soon as it was brought in the laboratory subsequently 10 l fully mixed and uniformly distributed water samples obtained from all sampling site were immediately added into a polymethyl methacrylate column height 80 cm diameter 15 cm at a water depth of 60 cm during the experimental period 60 ml water samples were collected at a 30 cm height away from the column bottom at 0 5 10 15 20 30 40 60 90 120 and 180 min each water sample was analyzed to determine the ss srp tp tdp and pp by using the aforementioned methods due to much higher ss concentrations in the water samples of cq and cs samples collected at various sampling times were used for tracking the variation in particle size distribution the static sedimentation experiment was conducted in duplicate for each sampling site pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to evaluate the kinetic order of the sedimentation process for ss and pp and their corresponding sedimentation rate constants of k 1 and k 2 were calculated according to the equations provided by ho and mckay 1999 t 1 2 is the time min required to reduce the ss and pp concentrations to half the initial level which were obtain based on he relationship between t 1 2 and k 1 and k 2 described by asher and pankow 1991 2 3 data collection and analysis hydrology and sediment data were collected from the changjiang sediment bulletin cwrc 2000 2016 and water environment data including eutrophication and water bloom data were obtained from the bulletin of ecological and environmental monitoring of the three gorges project in the yangtze river cnemc 1998 2016 phosphorus fraction data in ss before the impoundment of the tgr in july 2000 were obtained from the changjiang water resource protection bureau which belongs to the cwrc all statistical tests were performed using spss spss 2003 including multivariable correlation matrix calculations for the pp sedimentation process 3 results 3 1 water physicochemical properties and phosphorus distribution characteristics major water physicochemical parameters for the different sampling sites are summarized in table 1 during the flood season the water flow in the tgd slowed down with a 90 higher reduction amplitude being obtained and the measured flow velocity considerably decreased from more than 1 0 m s in cs and fl to nearly 0 10 m s in bd and xx table 1 the decline in flow velocity decreased the amount of ss in the water column moreover the turbidity level dramatically decreased from 106 5 ntu in cq to 18 0 ntu in zg and then increased to 29 6 ntu in yc with the decline in turbidity the water transparency quickly improved from 0 20 m in cq and cs to 0 60 m in ws which increased by 200 table 1 moreover water in the tgr was alkaline in general and the ph values ranged from 7 58 to 8 44 the water ec exhibited a moderate declining trend along the mainstream section of the tgr decreasing from 361 μs cm in cq to 332 μs cm in yc table 1 do concentrations were generally higher than 7 0 mg l and tended to slightly increase from the upper reach to the lower reach table 1 the zeta potential can be used to evaluate the colloid stability the higher the absolute value of the zeta potential indicates the greater colloid stability for tgr mainstream water column zeta potential ranged between 8 53 and 18 25 mv which tended to gradually decrease from the upper reach to the lower reach table 1 the presence of tgd greatly changed the hydrologic regime and thus led to a variation in the distribution of phosphorus as shown in fig 2 pp tp and srp exhibited the same declining trend from the upper reach to the lower reach pp sedimentation due to the decline in flow velocity greatly contributed to the tp concentration reduction as shown in fig 2 the pp concentrations gradually decreased from 0 346 mg l in cq to 0 022 mg l in zg when related the pp concentrations in yc to that in cq there are more than 94 of pp was trapped and deposited in the tgr this pp retention caused the pp to tp ratio to decrease from 60 in cq to approximately 15 in zg therefore the tp concentrations decreased from 0 577 mg l in cq to 0 144 mg l in zg srp can be directly used by phytoplankton ss and pp retention may increase the availability of srp and calculated srp to pp ratio increase from 26 in cq to 150 higher in zg ss can adsorb parts of srp and pp trapped through ss deposition in the tgr engender water column srp reduction adsorption of dissolved phosphorus to fine particles and dilution within lower river reaches may result the measured srp concentration reduced from 0 088 mg l in cq to 0 033 mg l in zg although srp was the minor component of the tp and tdp compared with phosphorus loads in zg the input of phosphorus through point and diffuse sources behind the tgd caused a slight increase in pp srp and tp concentrations observed in yc fig 2 3 2 pp sedimentation process and its impacting factors ss retention was most important driving force for pp reduction ss and pp concentrations sharply decreased from 105 88 mg l and 0 346 mg l in cq to 15 73 mg l and 0 022 mg l in zg which exhibited an similar decreasing amplitudes of 85 and 94 respectively due to varied flow distribution and complicated process of sediment transportation it is hard to understand the ss and pp sedimentation behavior in the tgr based on field monitoring tgr in particular of its lower reaches near the tgd served as stagnant water bodies after impoundment cq zg and yc were chosen as the representative sites for understanding the ss and pp sedimentation behavior in front of and behind the tgd fig 3 the pp sedimentation pattern was indicated to mirror the trend of ss sedimentation for each sampling site the higher the amount of ss deposited the higher was the reduction in the pp concentration in the water column initial ss and pp concentrations greatly influenced the sedimentation characteristics higher initial ss and pp concentrations required much longer time to balance the sedimentation process in general achieving the balanced conditions for pp sedimentation was more difficult in the upper river reaches than in the lower river reaches as shown in fig 3 pp sedimentation in cq was still unbalanced within 180 min whereas pp sedimentation in zg was balanced within less than 60 min this thus implies that due to the long distance from the sampling sites to the tgd the majority of pp may be rapidly deposited in the upper mainstream section of the tgr because of the relatively short sedimentation period the derived pseudo second order equations fitted the ss and pp sedimentation process much better than the pseudo first order kinetic models did and the correlation coefficients ranged between 0 65 and 0 97 fig 3 tables 2 and 3 the ss and pp sedimentation velocities k 2 were much lower in the upper river reaches such as in cq compared with those obtained in the lower river reaches such as in zg moreover t 1 2 is the time required to reduce the pp concentration to half the initial concentration the sites in the lower river reaches had much longer but shorter t 1 2 for ss and pp sedimentation compared with those in the upper river reaches as shown in table 3 50 of pp could be deposited in the first 60 min in cq cs fl and yc whereas a time of 80 300 min was required to deposit half of pp in the seven remaining sampling sites high ss concentrations and wide particle size distribution in upper river reaches increased the duration for reaching the sedimentation balance when compared to that in the lower river reaches coarse particles were much easier to be trapped in contrast to fine particles however fine particles usually contained much more phosphorus and are more prone to adsorb dissolved phosphorus than the coarse particles comprehensive effects of sedimentation and adsorption during the ss deposition process may cause the redistribution of phosphorus between water and sediments and thus led to the inconsistent trend of t 1 2 for ss and pp sedimentation factors including ss concentration pp concentration particle size and zeta potential are closely related to pp sedimentation as shown in table 4 t 1 2 of pp sedimentation was negatively correlated with pp concentrations and the median diameter of ss moreover t 1 2 was positively correlated with the absolute value of the water column s zeta potential in general a higher pp initial concentration and larger particle size caused faster pp sedimentation the higher the absolute value of the zeta potential the greater was the stability of the colloid system therefore a lower absolute value of the zeta potential was observed to favor pp sedimentation with an increase in the absolute value of the zeta potential from the upper river reaches to the lower river reaches table 1 t 1 2 for the pp sedimentation tended to moderately increase table 3 3 3 phosphorus fractions and bioavailability for ss in the flood season the ss concentration was significantly lower than the corresponding value of 1000 mg l that was obtained before the impoundment of the tgr in 2000 fig 4 in this study the ss concentrations sharply decreased from 105 88 mg l in cq to 15 73 mg l in zg fig 4 sedimentation of ss causes a variation in particle size distribution overall the median diameter of ss gradually decreased from 20 3 μm in cq to 6 62 μm in zg due to the continuous sedimentation of large particles fig 5 results from static sedimentation indicated that the median particle size sharply decreased to approximately 6 μm within 40 min in cq and cs fig 5 where the water column contained relatively high ss concentrations the measured tp contents in ss ranged from 945 to 1159 mg kg fig 4 with the decrease in the distance between the sampling sites and the tgd the tp contents generally exhibited a slightly increasing trend along the mainstream section of the tgr fine particles in the lower river reaches contained much higher phosphorus than that detected in the coarse particles in the upper river reaches ca p was the major component of the tp content which tended to decrease along the mainstream section and ca p contents decreased from more than 600 mg kg in cq to approximately 400 mg kg in zg fe p and al p constituted more than 20 to the tp load and exhibited a nonsignificant decreasing trend from the upper river reaches to the lower river reaches fig 4 org p was an important fraction of the tp load the org p contents continuously increased from 225 mg kg in cq to 385 mg kg in zg indicating that fine particles contained much higher org p than the coarse sediment particles compared with background values obtained before the impoundment of the tgr in july 2000 the tp fe p and al p and ca p contents in ss were several times higher in this study fig 4 high ss concentrations 1000 mg l fig 4 and a small amount of total phosphorus less than 0 2 mg l in the water column were the possible reasons for the low phosphorus contents detected before the impoundment of the tgr however relatively high ss loads during the flood season caused significantly greater pp flux in pre tgr period than that in post tgr period 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting pp sedimentation from zx to zg the flow velocity was always lower than 0 4 m s thus resulting in a lower intensity of turbulent flow and longer retention time tang et al 2016 above specified hydrodynamic conditions facilitate the combination of metal ions with phosphate and the flocculation of metal oxides or hydroxides which can greatly facilitate the settlement of ss nearly 98 4 of the sediment in the tgr was transported in the form of ss and 90 of the total ss transportation occurred during the flood season mao et al 2012 therefore understanding the pp transportation behavior during the flood season in the tgr is highly imperative the hydrodynamic condition of varying flow velocity was the first direct contributor to the distribution of pp in the reservoir impoundment caused the natural rapid flow gradually changed to slow flow even dead water for the mainstream of the tgr cnemc 1998 2016 as the distance between the sampling sites and the tgd decreased pp and ss concentrations exhibited an overlapping declining pattern the concentrations tended to decrease from cq to zg due to the reduction in flow velocity table 1 the tgd adopts an operational mode of storing clear water in the dry season and discharging muddy water in the wet season for preventing sediment deposition li et al 2015 however when the impounded water level reached to 175 m most of the ss deposited in cs mao et al 2012 which is far from the tgd implying that a dramatic decrease in flow velocity in front of the tgr facilitated the sedimentation of ss and pp moreover more than 50 of pp was deposited in less than 1 h in the river reaches above cs table 3 hydrological and sediment investigation results indicated that the ratio of ss delivered to the tgr decreased from 36 to approximately 20 as the impounded water level increased from 156 to 175 m respectively cwrc 2010 2016 the reduction in the ratio of ss delivered to the tgr implies that an increase in the impounded water level demonstrated a significant retention effect on ss as well as pp even during the flood season in river systems part of dissolved phosphorus was adsorbed on suspended particles such as ss and then pp was reduced by particle deposition pan et al 2013 moreover fine particles generally tend to adsorb more dissolved phosphorus than coarse particles because of the larger surface area in a unit mass of particles yao et al 2016 lager particle size d 50 of ss with higher pp concentrations in water column simultaneously occurred in upper river reaches where water column contained high ss and tp loads fig 2 and table 4 however when related the d 50 to tp content in ss they are negatively correlated with coefficients of 0 34 which demonstrated that fine particles contained relatively more phosphorus sedimentation was described as the primary mechanism of the deposition of fine particles wang et al 2009 in general fine particles existed as clay and silt was the dominant constituent of ss in the mainstream section of the tgr wu et al 2016 the results from the static sedimentation experiment indicate that the ss concentration and water physicochemical properties were closely related to pp sedimentation performance table 4 indicates that the particle size d50 and zeta potential were negatively and positively related to t 1 2 of pp sedimentation that was obtained from the pseudo second order kinetic model respectively sedimentation velocity of fine particles is the key parameter for evaluating the ss and pp carrying capacity li et al 2016 conducted field measurements of settling velocities of fine sediments in zx and fj using acoustic doppler velocimeter during the flood season and found that most of the effective settling velocities were within the range of 0 1 10 mm s however the median particle diameters in the tgr are 4 10 μm and thus the corresponding settling velocities were 0 01 0 09 mm s based on stokes equation li et al 2016a b assumed the ss sampled in zx and fj in this study were settled with above velocities the calculated t 1 2 equal to settlement distance of 30 cm in static sedimentation process ranged between 56 and 500 min which seems lower than 122 min zx and 42 min fj in table 2 it is implicated that static conditions were much favorable for the flocculation and sedimentations process than field natural water flow conditions retention of sediment particles with a median diameter larger than 0 01 mm dominated the ss sedimentation process in the tgr li et al 2016a b in general pp contained in ss with a large particle size is more prone to settlement due to its relatively high density a previous study indicated that fine sand in the tgr with a median particle size larger than 0 01 mm had a much higher dry density 0 70 g cm3 than fine silt 0 50 60 g cm3 with the d50 values ranging from 0 005 to 0 01 mm zhang 2013 pp contained in ss obtained from the lower river reaches had a smaller particles size and stronger cohesive properties fig 4 and its sedimentation process was primarily dependent on flocculation performance absolute values of the zeta potential can be used to evaluate the influence of flocculation on pp sedimentation in this study the absolute value of the zeta potential was between 10 and 20 mv which lies in the unstable range of 10 30 mv for colloid flocculation thurøcarstensen et al 1972 if the absolute value of the zeta potential is considerably high the difficultly of colloid sedimentation is increased arias et al 2008 ss obtained from lower river reaches generally has a much higher absolute value of the zeta potential than that obtained in upper river reaches table 1 which may increase the period for achieving balanced conditions for pp sedimentation moreover pp is mostly bound to negatively charged ss as negative charges of ss in the water column increase electrostatic repulsion is generated to prevent the flocculation of fine particles to medium and large sized particles and the sedimentation of pp is thus delayed 4 2 change in pp bioavailability measured 0 945 1 159 mg g tp content in ss for 11 mainstream sampling sites 10 in tgr and 1behined tgd was comparable to that reported 1 04 1 52 mg g for 7 sampling sites 4 in tg and 3 in tributaries han et al 2018 but was obviously higher than 0 904 0 105 mg kg tp in the bs wu et al 2016 various phosphorus fractions in ss have various bioavailabilities fe p or al p can be exchanged with oh and other inorganic phosphorus compounds and can be used for the evaluation of algal available phosphorus zhou et al 2001 ca p was reported to be a relatively stable fraction especially in neutral and alkaline environments jin et al 2006 and was attributed to the permanent burial of phosphorus within sediment particles org p was indicated to represent the phosphorus fraction bound to organic matter which directly affected the availability levels of dissolved phosphorus for phytoplankton growth edlund and carman 2001 for the ss of the 11 sampling sites in the tgr phosphorus was mainly of detrital origin ca p whereas minor fe al p originated more from anthropogenic sources wu et al 2011 moreover nearly 28 of fe al p contained in ss was significantly higher than approximately 19 in bs wu et al 2016 it is indicated that ss has much stronger affinity of phosphorus than bs in the tgr impoundment greatly changed the content of tp and its fractions bound to ss from the tail to the front area of the tgr tp and bioavailable phosphorus bio p fractions fe p or al p org p tended to increase which exhibited an opposite trend to the corresponding distribution of the ss concentrations fig 4 compared with cq the tp and bio p contents in zg increased to 18 87 and 26 66 respectively from the tail to the front area of the tgr silt gradually replaced sand and subsequently constituted the dominant portion of ss wu et al 2016 in general fine silt has a much higher specific area and metal oxide content than sand and can adsorb much more dissolved phosphorus than coarse particles tang et al 2014 yao et al 2016 therefore ss in lower river reaches contained much higher bio p than that in the upper river reaches an increased bio p content in fine particles and a lower flow velocity in the lower fl of the tgr greatly favored the growth of harmful algae and consequently promoted blooms in this area zhang et al 2012 compared with natural river channel conditions the tp and fe p or al p contents increased by more than two and eight times respectively fig 4 this can be attributed to two major reasons the first is the reduction in the size of particles entering the tgr the mean particle size of ss in the mainstream section of the tgr decreased from 0 011 to 0 009 mm between 2003 and 2010 when compared with the values in the 1990s and that in yc decreased from 0 009 mm between 1987 and 2002 to 0 004 mm between 2003 and 2010 crwc 2000 2016 the decline in particle size facilitated ss adsorption and fixed a greater amount of phosphorus the second reason is the increase in soluble phosphorus availability to ss metal oxides and hydroxides were revealed to be the major components of the fine particles in the sediment of the tgr ding et al 2013 and they have been reported to exhibit a high phosphate adsorption capacity cotovicz et al 2014 and to engender an increase in the content of bio p and tp in fine sediment when compared with that in the coarse particles zhu et al 2013 from 1996 to 2014 the annual domestic wastewater discharge volume from the tgr region increased from less than 0 25 to approximately 0 80 billion tons and the average phosphorus fertilizer consumption increased to 16 during the same period zhuo et al 2017 in china the discharge standard for phosphorus for municipal wastewater is higher than 1 0 mg l mep 2002 therefore domestic wastewater discharge results in 800 tons of soluble phosphorus input annually which greatly promotes the adsorption and combination of phosphors to fine ss particles in the tgr ss has strong affinity to dissolved phosphorus due to their high specific surface areas and surface active sites fang et al 2013 previous study indicated that phosphorus adsorption capacity was 135 mg kg for the bs of tgr with the experimental sediment and phosphorus concentrations of 2 0 g l and 0 50 mg l respectively cao et al 2011 when compared to the average ss loads 0 1 g l and tdp 0 1 mg l concentrations in this study figs 2 and 4 the amount of dissolved phosphorus adsorbed to the ss may be negligible in contrast to approximately 1000 mg kg p content in ss the partition coefficient k d is defined as the ratio between the concentrations of pp and tdp and also used as an indicator for evaluating the capability of sediment to retain p evgeny et al 2014 huang et al 2017 fitted the k d well to the ss concentrations in the tgr with the following equation 1 k d 4 2242 s 0 701 r 2 0 527 in this study calculated k d ranged between 0 16 and 0 68 with equation 1 based on measured ss concentrations however the actual k d range was 0 18 1 73 when determined with pp and tdp data in fig 2 and ss in upper river reaches has much higher k d than that in lower river reaches the possible reason maybe that k d is not a simple function of ss and greatly varies at a certain ss loads huang et al 2017 relatively high ss loads abundant tdp supply and low zeta potential absolute values may facilitate the adsorption and flocculation of dissolved p into ss in the upper river reaches 4 3 contribution of pp sedimentation to eutrophication a high level of water impoundment was revealed to result in a decline in the flow velocity along the mainstream section of the changjiang river zhou et al 2015 and ss sedimentation correspondingly lead to a significant deposition of pp consequently increasing the water transparency the river reaches between cq and zg were the major deposition areas for ss and were the main accumulation areas for bio p wu et al 2016 the internal release of p has a flux in the range of 0 15 2 55 mg m 2 a 1 niu et al 2013 wang et al 2015 which had a minor contribution to the entire phosphorus loads in the water column however accompanied by the settlement of ss pp concentrations in the water column were decreased from 0 34 mg l in cq to 0 02 mg l in zg fig 2 pp sedimentation also changed the ratio of pp to srp from cq to zg the ratio of srp to pp gradually increased from 25 51 to 153 38 moreover except for the bd sampling sites the srp concentrations at the other nine sampling sites in the tgr exceeded 0 02 mg l which is a critical value of phosphorus loads for algae blooms tang et al 2014 therefore low ss contents and sufficient srp concentrations may greatly enhance the bioavailability of phosphorus to algae thus creating favorable conditions for the outburst of water blooms dam retention and ss deposition in the tgr reduced water column particle contents and subsequently decreased the combined capacity of water column soluble phosphorus to ss moreover massive anthropic input of industrial and domestic wastewater causes the tgr to receive a substantial amount of soluble phosphorus zhuo et al 2017 specifically impoundment fueled the water eutrophication in the tgr not only on a temporal scale but also on a spatial scale long term monitoring of data indicated that water blooms mainly occurred between march and july after the impounded water level was initially135 m however the period for water bloom outburst extended to between march and october after the impounded water level exceeded 156 m cnemc 1998 2016 moreover water blooms occurred in no more than three tributaries since the first impoundment to 135 m subsequently nearly 11 to 22 tributaries were frequently subjected to water blooms after impoundment to 175 m fig 6 which accounted for between 1 3 and 2 3 of the total tributaries in the tgr notably increasing the impoundment level can reduce the number of eutrophic tributaries in the current year but may dramatically increase the number of eutrophic tributaries in the following several years fig 6 increasing the impoundment level in autumn restrained the autumn water bloom outburst mainly due to a diluting effect of nutrient and a low water temperature in the earlier winter but encouraged the spring water bloom due to the reduction in water flow and ss improvement in water transparency increase in temperature and availability of water column nutrients combined from the external input and internal releases from a newly submerged area xiao et al 2017 furthermore the trophic status of the tgr changed on the basis of an impoundment accident the proportions of oligotrophic sections sharply decreased from 20 38 in 2005 to 0 32 in 2011 additionally the proportion of slight moderate and heavy eutrophication sections significantly increased from 19 23 in 2005 to 39 53 in 2011 fig 6 therefore the risk of water blooms generally increased in the tgr due to the increase in the impounded water level once the water column nutrient concentrations exceeded their threshold values for eutrophication suitable temperature slow flow and excellent transparency may play important roles in the outburst of water bloom xu et al 2009 ji et al 2017 previous study found that constant water level and high temperature led to the stability and thermal stratification of the daning rvier a tributary of tgr and thus resulted in a high phytoplankton biomass zhu et al 2013 however other researchers argued that water temperature in the tgr ranged between 8 0 c and 29 0 c which is quite suitable for the growth and development of phytoplankton in particular of diatom and cyptophyta dai et al 2010 ji et al 2017 so water temperature can not be regarded as the limited factor for water bloom reduction in water flow greatly favored the propagation of majority algae species slowing down of the flow velocity in the mainstream and branches nearby the tgd will diminish the restrain of rapid stream on the growth of algae to some extent and such water flow condition even can be developed to encourage the growth of some slow flow or stagnant water favored algae species such as bacillariophyta s cyclotella and pyrophyta s prridiniaceae dai et al 2010 moreover due to decline in upstream ss input and efficiently ss sedimentation in the tgr mao et al 2012 increased water column transparency may significantly promote the photosynthesis of phytoplankton and drastically augmented the algae biomass xu et al 2009 ji et al 2017 therefore reduction nutrient input from the three gorges region as well as its upstream areas and improvement of the hydrodynamic conditions of the tgr via optimizing the operation mode were both needed for eutrophicaiton control and algae bloom prevention retention of ss and pp also greatly changed the natural balance relationship among the water flow ss and nutrient content of the lower reaches behind the tgd comparing yc with cq revealed that 76 25 of ss and 75 35 of pp were trapped in the tgr due to tgd figs 2 and 4 moreover historical statistic results indicated that the amount of sediment discharged between 2003 and 2010 decreased to 93 when compared with the values obtained between 1991 and 2002 cwrc 2000 2016 an increase in the impounded water level caused an annual sediment deposition volume increase from 12 40 million tons in 2003 to 19 60 million tons in 2010 fig 7 due to water and soil conservation in the upstream and ss trapped by tgd the discharged ss volume and its concentrations tended to decrease as shown in fig 8 the annual total discharged ss loads and the corresponding mean concentrations decreased from 22 80 million tons and 578 mg l in 2002 before impoundment to 8 50 million tones and 20 mg l in 2016 respectively inadequate supplementation of ss to the lower reaches behind the tgd causes a high ratio of soluble nutrient discharge from the tgr moreover external input from surrounding point and nonpoint sources may provide overdosed bioavailable phosphorus and reduce the corresponding water environmental buffer capacity for phosphorus in the downstream river reaches and in the corresponding naturally connected lakes such as the dongting lake and poyang lake guo et al 2011 evaluated the effects of the impoundment of the tgr on the water environmental capacity of the poyang lake and found that the annual average po4 3 concentration increased from 0 060 mg l in 2003 to 0 215 mg l in 2009 which is closely related to the change in water sediment transportation due to the impoundment of the tgr and subsequently increased the risk of water blooms in the warm dry season 5 conclusions tgd caused obvious trapping effects on ss and pp even during the flood season under a low water level tgd caused 76 25 of ss and 75 35 of pp to be trapped in the tgr due to retention and deposition as observed through a comparison of cq and yc pp was the major component of tp the pp concentration dramatically decreased along the mainstream section of the tgr moreover pp concentrations gradually dropped from 0 35 mg l in cq to 0 02 mg l in zg due to the reduction in water flow velocity particle size d50 of ss was negatively r2 034 but positively r2 0 92 related to tp content in ss and pp concentrations in water column respectively pp has a sedimentation behavior that is similar to ss the derived pseudo second order equations fitted the ss and pp sedimentation process much better than the pseudo first order kinetic models did more than 50 of pp sedimentation could be obtained in less than 60 min for the upper cq cs and fl sampling sites and exhibited corresponding settlement velocities of no more than 0 01 mm s under static conditions the t 1 2 value of pp sedimentation was negatively and positively related to the median particle size and absolute value of the water column s zeta potential respectively compared with natural river conditions impoundment due to tgd resulted in a significant reduction in ss concentrations median particle size of ss and total discharged loads to the lower river reaches such as yc moreover the amount of tp and fe al p bound to ss particles was several times higher than that obtained before the impoundment of the reservoir with an increase in the impounded water level the ss content tended to decrease moreover suitable water temperature slow water flow excellent water transparency and abundant soluble phosphorus input promoted the water bloom outburst in a higher number of tributaries for longer periods

19526,the transportation and sedimentation of particulate phosphorus pp in a huge reservoir such as the three gorges reservoir tgr are closely related to the phosphorus distribution characteristics and nutritional status of the water body in this study the pp distribution sedimentation and bioavailability in the mainstream section of the tgr were investigated through a field survey indoor simulated settlement experiment and historical data analysis the results indicated that pp was the major component of the total phosphorus tp and that the three gorges dam tgd trapped nearly 76 25 of suspended sediment ss and 75 35 of pp in the tgr even during the flood season a decline in flow velocity promoted the deposition of pp additionally pp concentrations gradually dropped from 0 35 mg l in chongqing to 0 02 mg l in zigui the static pp sedimentation process adequately fitted a pseudo second order kinetic equation with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0 97 moreover more than half of the pp sedimentation process was achieved in less than 60 min for samples collected from the upper river reaches within simulated sedimentation process the median particle size of ss and absolute value of the water column s zeta potential were negatively and positively related to the t 1 2 values of pp sedimentation respectively compared with the concentration and particle size of ss obtained in the pre tgr period the values in the mainstream section of the tgr were lower however the tp and fe al p contents in ss increased several times due to the combined effects of flow velocity reduction and ss trapping the water transparency and bioavailability of water column phosphorus were enhanced thus the risk of water bloom outburst significantly increased when the impounded water level of 175 m in the tgr became the normal state graphical abstract image keywords three gorges reservoir tgr suspended sediment ss particulate phosphorus pp sedimentation water bloom 1 introduction the three gorges dam tgd located in the upper mainstream section of the changjiang river is the world s largest water conservancy and hydroelectric project fu et al 2010 the three gorges reservoir tgr spreads across the reach of the changjiang river between jiangjin of the city of chongqing and yichang of hubei province with a total water surface area of 1 08 103 km2 and a storage capacity of 39 3 billion cubic meters wang et al 2013 to investigate and mitigate the potential negative impacts of this huge reservoir operation on the ecological environment a staged impoundment scheme has been adopted for the tgr three major stages of the impoundment scheme were completed in 2003 2006 and 2010 by raising the storage level up to 135 156 and 175 m respectively wang et al 2013 therefore since 2010 tgr has been fully operational with the water level fluctuating between 145 m in the wet season from april to september and 175 m in the dry season from october to mid april sediment deposition and eutrophication were considered as the two major problems to be solved during the post tgr period nevertheless effective traps set by the upstream large cascade reservoirs including xiangjiaba and xiluodu along with appropriate water and soil conservation measures mao et al 2012 cao et al 2011 reduced sediment input and solved the sediment deposition challenge to a great extent however a water bloom immediately occurred in nearly 10 of the associated tributaries and bays such as the xiangxi river in which the water was first impounded to a level of 135 m in 2003 zhang et al 2012 since 2010 the water in the tgr has been normally been impounded to a level of 175 m moreover a decline in the flow velocity and increase in the water transparency and soluble nutrient content may have caused the frequent outburst of water blooms on a larger water surface area phosphorus has already been identified as the nutrient element responsible for eutrophication in the tgr zhang et al 2012 wu et al 2016 han et al 2018 in a reservoir ecosystem phosphorus is mostly stored in environmental media including water suspended sediment ss and bed sediment bs for the tgr researchers have mostly conducted studies to understand the status and mechanism of phosphorus storage in water and bs and have focused on the sources of phosphorus sinks of phosphorus interactions of phosphorus with sediment and consequences of increased phosphorus concentrations such as eutrophication in the mainstream and its tributaries huang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 few studies have reported the impacts of dam retention of ss on particulate phosphorus pp transportation obvious retentions of pp were observed due to ss trapping yao et al 2009 han et al 2018 found that the pp concentration showed a decreasing trend from the tail area to the head area of the tgr because of particle deposition along the four mainstream sections pp serves a key role in regulating water transparency and balancing the inorganic phosphate flux in the water column however no detailed study has been conducted to understand the spatial distribution of pp in the front and back sections of the dam understanding this distribution may help to reveal the factors involved in contributing to pp deposition and retention in the tgd ss is the most important carrier of pp because it can buffer dissolved inorganic phosphate through particle adsorption pan et al 2002 the appearance of dam induced hydrological variations greatly affected the transport and transformation of phosphorus in the reservoir miller 2012 in the tgr the fate of pp is closely related to the ss transportation process nearly 98 4 of the total sediment in the tgr has been transported in the form of ss moreover 90 of the total ss transportation occurred during the flood season and the particle size for 50 of the ss ranged from 0 008 to 0 063 mm mao et al 2012 compared with the pre tgr period ss input loads and particle size both tended to decline during the post tgr period annual loads and mean particle size for ss entering the tgr decreased by 56 and 18 respectively between 2003 and 2010 compared with the values in the 1990s mao et al 2012 crwc 2000 2016 moreover water impoundment to a level of 175 m reduced the average flow velocity to between 0 09 and 2 43 m s which was much lower than that between 3 and 5 m s observed in natural river channels cnemc 1998 2016 impoundment obviously changed the hydrodynamic conditions for ss transportation however the related effects of impoundment on pp distribution and sedimentation in the tgr are still unknown in the tgr fine silt was reported to contain a higher amount of phosphorus than coarse sand because fine particles tend to adsorb a greater amount of dissolved phosphorus additionally the pp content in ss ranged between 1 04 and 1 52 mg g which was 30 higher than that contained in bs han et al 2018 pp was the dominant contributor to the phosphorus in bs a previous study found the total phosphorus budget in the tgr to be 65 685 and 43 684 t a during the pre and post impoundment periods respectively with upstream river inputs accounting for 93 and 84 respectively ran et al 2009 in general pp bounded to ss has a much higher bioavailability than that bounded to bs bioavailable fractions including exchangeable phosphorus ex p fe bounded phosphorus fe p and extractable organic phosphorus org p accounted for 42 53 of the total phosphorus tp content in the inner regions of the tgr han et al 2018 compared with the upstream input sediment release contributed less than 0 098 a negligible amount to the phosphorus in the tgr niu et al 2013 however from 2003 to 2010 when the impounded water level increased from 135 to 156 and 175m the sediment deposition volume of the tgr dramatically increased from 0 55 to 0 66 and 1 20 billion cubic meters respectively changjiang water resource commission cwrc 2000 2016 clearly impoundment to 175 m engendered a considerably large amount of ss as well as pp deposition in the tgr nevertheless little information is available concerning the variation in phosphorus bioavailability due to uncertain change of ss in the post tgr period as compared with the pre tgr period impoundment causes unbalanced water sediment and nutrient transportation in the changjiang river consequently the distribution sedimentation and bioavailability of pp is effected in the tgr in this study ss samples were collected during the flood season from 11 sections that were mainly located in the mainstream section of the tgr this study had the following objectives to understand the effects of dam retention on pp storage and distribution along the mainstream section of the tgr explore the characteristics of pp sedimentation by using a simulated settlement experiment examine the variation in ss transportation and bioavailability of pp between the pre and post tgr periods the findings of this study can improve the understanding of ss and pp transportation behavior after the tgr entered its full operating mode in addition to providing scientific evidence of the effects of impoundment on trophic status evolution and eutrophication control in the tgr 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and measurement in july 2017 surface water and ss samples 0 5 m below the water surface were collected at 11 representative sites fig 1 among these sites 10 namely chongqing cq changshou cs fuling fl zhongxian zx yunyang yy fengjie fj wushan ws badong bd xiangxi xx and zigui zg were in front of the tgd whereas 1 namely yichang yc was behind the tgd in the mainstream section of the changjiang river cq cs fl zx yy fj ws bd xx and zg were 619 1 538 1 489 2 370 2 252 2 169 3 124 3 76 4 31 and 2 5 km from the tgd whereas yc was 34 8 km behind the tgd water samples 200 ml were collected using precleaned polyethylene bottles several drops of chloroform were added to inhibit bacterial activity approximately 80 ml of the water samples was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter and then stored at 4 c the residual unfiltered water samples were also stored at 4 c during the sampling period ph water temperature dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec redox potential and turbidity were field measured with a portable meter ysi proplus usa transparency and flow velocity were also field determined for each sampling site by using a secchi disc and direct reading current meter global water respectively the ss content was calculated by filtering the samples through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter and then drying them at 105 c in an oven as the weight of particulate matter all water samples were immediately measured when they arrived at the laboratory the filtered water was analyzed for total dissolved phosphorus tdp and zeta potential the zeta potential was determined using a zetasizer nanoseries malvern instruments ltd the unfiltered water samples were used to detect the soluble reactive phosphorus srp and tp after 2 h of digestion with potassium persulfate in an autoclave tdp and tp as well as srp without digestion were measured by the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method apha 1998 the total pp in water means dissolved phosphorus bounded to the water column particles which was assumed to be equivalent to the difference between the tp and tdp surface water samples 30 l for each sampling site were filtered through six 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filters by using vacuum filtration the particles accumulated on the filter were naturally air dried carefully separated and stored in dry conditions ss particles approximately 0 01 g were dissolved and fully mixed in 10 ml pure water subsequently the mixture was used to determine the particle size distribution with a horiba 950v2 laser diffraction particle size analyzer sequential extraction of phosphorus was conducted to determine the phosphorus species in ss in accordance with the standards measurements and testing protocol ruban et al 2001 the dried 0 1 g ss particles were filled into a 50 ml centrifuge tube subsequently ex p fe and al oxide bound phosphorus fe p and al p respectively and calcium bound phosphorus ca p were extracted with 1 mol l nh4cl naoh and hcl respectively the tp content consisted of the p bounded to particle s external surface and p contained in its inner mineral components which was determined by exposing the original particles to 450 c followed by hcl extraction ruban et al 2001 org p was estimated to be the difference between tp and the sum of ex p fe p or al p and ca p 2 2 simulated static sedimentation experiments revealing the sedimentation process of ss and pp is challenging due to the complicated hydrodynamic conditions e g varied flow velocity great water depth wide cross section and complex underwater topography in the tgr however understanding the ss and pp sedimentation performance in stagnant water bodies through a simulated static sedimentation experiment is necessary and reasonable approximately 20 l surface water was collected to conduct the sedimentation experiment several drops of chloroform were added to inhibit bacterial activity the surface water was adequately but moderately shaken as soon as it was brought in the laboratory subsequently 10 l fully mixed and uniformly distributed water samples obtained from all sampling site were immediately added into a polymethyl methacrylate column height 80 cm diameter 15 cm at a water depth of 60 cm during the experimental period 60 ml water samples were collected at a 30 cm height away from the column bottom at 0 5 10 15 20 30 40 60 90 120 and 180 min each water sample was analyzed to determine the ss srp tp tdp and pp by using the aforementioned methods due to much higher ss concentrations in the water samples of cq and cs samples collected at various sampling times were used for tracking the variation in particle size distribution the static sedimentation experiment was conducted in duplicate for each sampling site pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to evaluate the kinetic order of the sedimentation process for ss and pp and their corresponding sedimentation rate constants of k 1 and k 2 were calculated according to the equations provided by ho and mckay 1999 t 1 2 is the time min required to reduce the ss and pp concentrations to half the initial level which were obtain based on he relationship between t 1 2 and k 1 and k 2 described by asher and pankow 1991 2 3 data collection and analysis hydrology and sediment data were collected from the changjiang sediment bulletin cwrc 2000 2016 and water environment data including eutrophication and water bloom data were obtained from the bulletin of ecological and environmental monitoring of the three gorges project in the yangtze river cnemc 1998 2016 phosphorus fraction data in ss before the impoundment of the tgr in july 2000 were obtained from the changjiang water resource protection bureau which belongs to the cwrc all statistical tests were performed using spss spss 2003 including multivariable correlation matrix calculations for the pp sedimentation process 3 results 3 1 water physicochemical properties and phosphorus distribution characteristics major water physicochemical parameters for the different sampling sites are summarized in table 1 during the flood season the water flow in the tgd slowed down with a 90 higher reduction amplitude being obtained and the measured flow velocity considerably decreased from more than 1 0 m s in cs and fl to nearly 0 10 m s in bd and xx table 1 the decline in flow velocity decreased the amount of ss in the water column moreover the turbidity level dramatically decreased from 106 5 ntu in cq to 18 0 ntu in zg and then increased to 29 6 ntu in yc with the decline in turbidity the water transparency quickly improved from 0 20 m in cq and cs to 0 60 m in ws which increased by 200 table 1 moreover water in the tgr was alkaline in general and the ph values ranged from 7 58 to 8 44 the water ec exhibited a moderate declining trend along the mainstream section of the tgr decreasing from 361 μs cm in cq to 332 μs cm in yc table 1 do concentrations were generally higher than 7 0 mg l and tended to slightly increase from the upper reach to the lower reach table 1 the zeta potential can be used to evaluate the colloid stability the higher the absolute value of the zeta potential indicates the greater colloid stability for tgr mainstream water column zeta potential ranged between 8 53 and 18 25 mv which tended to gradually decrease from the upper reach to the lower reach table 1 the presence of tgd greatly changed the hydrologic regime and thus led to a variation in the distribution of phosphorus as shown in fig 2 pp tp and srp exhibited the same declining trend from the upper reach to the lower reach pp sedimentation due to the decline in flow velocity greatly contributed to the tp concentration reduction as shown in fig 2 the pp concentrations gradually decreased from 0 346 mg l in cq to 0 022 mg l in zg when related the pp concentrations in yc to that in cq there are more than 94 of pp was trapped and deposited in the tgr this pp retention caused the pp to tp ratio to decrease from 60 in cq to approximately 15 in zg therefore the tp concentrations decreased from 0 577 mg l in cq to 0 144 mg l in zg srp can be directly used by phytoplankton ss and pp retention may increase the availability of srp and calculated srp to pp ratio increase from 26 in cq to 150 higher in zg ss can adsorb parts of srp and pp trapped through ss deposition in the tgr engender water column srp reduction adsorption of dissolved phosphorus to fine particles and dilution within lower river reaches may result the measured srp concentration reduced from 0 088 mg l in cq to 0 033 mg l in zg although srp was the minor component of the tp and tdp compared with phosphorus loads in zg the input of phosphorus through point and diffuse sources behind the tgd caused a slight increase in pp srp and tp concentrations observed in yc fig 2 3 2 pp sedimentation process and its impacting factors ss retention was most important driving force for pp reduction ss and pp concentrations sharply decreased from 105 88 mg l and 0 346 mg l in cq to 15 73 mg l and 0 022 mg l in zg which exhibited an similar decreasing amplitudes of 85 and 94 respectively due to varied flow distribution and complicated process of sediment transportation it is hard to understand the ss and pp sedimentation behavior in the tgr based on field monitoring tgr in particular of its lower reaches near the tgd served as stagnant water bodies after impoundment cq zg and yc were chosen as the representative sites for understanding the ss and pp sedimentation behavior in front of and behind the tgd fig 3 the pp sedimentation pattern was indicated to mirror the trend of ss sedimentation for each sampling site the higher the amount of ss deposited the higher was the reduction in the pp concentration in the water column initial ss and pp concentrations greatly influenced the sedimentation characteristics higher initial ss and pp concentrations required much longer time to balance the sedimentation process in general achieving the balanced conditions for pp sedimentation was more difficult in the upper river reaches than in the lower river reaches as shown in fig 3 pp sedimentation in cq was still unbalanced within 180 min whereas pp sedimentation in zg was balanced within less than 60 min this thus implies that due to the long distance from the sampling sites to the tgd the majority of pp may be rapidly deposited in the upper mainstream section of the tgr because of the relatively short sedimentation period the derived pseudo second order equations fitted the ss and pp sedimentation process much better than the pseudo first order kinetic models did and the correlation coefficients ranged between 0 65 and 0 97 fig 3 tables 2 and 3 the ss and pp sedimentation velocities k 2 were much lower in the upper river reaches such as in cq compared with those obtained in the lower river reaches such as in zg moreover t 1 2 is the time required to reduce the pp concentration to half the initial concentration the sites in the lower river reaches had much longer but shorter t 1 2 for ss and pp sedimentation compared with those in the upper river reaches as shown in table 3 50 of pp could be deposited in the first 60 min in cq cs fl and yc whereas a time of 80 300 min was required to deposit half of pp in the seven remaining sampling sites high ss concentrations and wide particle size distribution in upper river reaches increased the duration for reaching the sedimentation balance when compared to that in the lower river reaches coarse particles were much easier to be trapped in contrast to fine particles however fine particles usually contained much more phosphorus and are more prone to adsorb dissolved phosphorus than the coarse particles comprehensive effects of sedimentation and adsorption during the ss deposition process may cause the redistribution of phosphorus between water and sediments and thus led to the inconsistent trend of t 1 2 for ss and pp sedimentation factors including ss concentration pp concentration particle size and zeta potential are closely related to pp sedimentation as shown in table 4 t 1 2 of pp sedimentation was negatively correlated with pp concentrations and the median diameter of ss moreover t 1 2 was positively correlated with the absolute value of the water column s zeta potential in general a higher pp initial concentration and larger particle size caused faster pp sedimentation the higher the absolute value of the zeta potential the greater was the stability of the colloid system therefore a lower absolute value of the zeta potential was observed to favor pp sedimentation with an increase in the absolute value of the zeta potential from the upper river reaches to the lower river reaches table 1 t 1 2 for the pp sedimentation tended to moderately increase table 3 3 3 phosphorus fractions and bioavailability for ss in the flood season the ss concentration was significantly lower than the corresponding value of 1000 mg l that was obtained before the impoundment of the tgr in 2000 fig 4 in this study the ss concentrations sharply decreased from 105 88 mg l in cq to 15 73 mg l in zg fig 4 sedimentation of ss causes a variation in particle size distribution overall the median diameter of ss gradually decreased from 20 3 μm in cq to 6 62 μm in zg due to the continuous sedimentation of large particles fig 5 results from static sedimentation indicated that the median particle size sharply decreased to approximately 6 μm within 40 min in cq and cs fig 5 where the water column contained relatively high ss concentrations the measured tp contents in ss ranged from 945 to 1159 mg kg fig 4 with the decrease in the distance between the sampling sites and the tgd the tp contents generally exhibited a slightly increasing trend along the mainstream section of the tgr fine particles in the lower river reaches contained much higher phosphorus than that detected in the coarse particles in the upper river reaches ca p was the major component of the tp content which tended to decrease along the mainstream section and ca p contents decreased from more than 600 mg kg in cq to approximately 400 mg kg in zg fe p and al p constituted more than 20 to the tp load and exhibited a nonsignificant decreasing trend from the upper river reaches to the lower river reaches fig 4 org p was an important fraction of the tp load the org p contents continuously increased from 225 mg kg in cq to 385 mg kg in zg indicating that fine particles contained much higher org p than the coarse sediment particles compared with background values obtained before the impoundment of the tgr in july 2000 the tp fe p and al p and ca p contents in ss were several times higher in this study fig 4 high ss concentrations 1000 mg l fig 4 and a small amount of total phosphorus less than 0 2 mg l in the water column were the possible reasons for the low phosphorus contents detected before the impoundment of the tgr however relatively high ss loads during the flood season caused significantly greater pp flux in pre tgr period than that in post tgr period 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting pp sedimentation from zx to zg the flow velocity was always lower than 0 4 m s thus resulting in a lower intensity of turbulent flow and longer retention time tang et al 2016 above specified hydrodynamic conditions facilitate the combination of metal ions with phosphate and the flocculation of metal oxides or hydroxides which can greatly facilitate the settlement of ss nearly 98 4 of the sediment in the tgr was transported in the form of ss and 90 of the total ss transportation occurred during the flood season mao et al 2012 therefore understanding the pp transportation behavior during the flood season in the tgr is highly imperative the hydrodynamic condition of varying flow velocity was the first direct contributor to the distribution of pp in the reservoir impoundment caused the natural rapid flow gradually changed to slow flow even dead water for the mainstream of the tgr cnemc 1998 2016 as the distance between the sampling sites and the tgd decreased pp and ss concentrations exhibited an overlapping declining pattern the concentrations tended to decrease from cq to zg due to the reduction in flow velocity table 1 the tgd adopts an operational mode of storing clear water in the dry season and discharging muddy water in the wet season for preventing sediment deposition li et al 2015 however when the impounded water level reached to 175 m most of the ss deposited in cs mao et al 2012 which is far from the tgd implying that a dramatic decrease in flow velocity in front of the tgr facilitated the sedimentation of ss and pp moreover more than 50 of pp was deposited in less than 1 h in the river reaches above cs table 3 hydrological and sediment investigation results indicated that the ratio of ss delivered to the tgr decreased from 36 to approximately 20 as the impounded water level increased from 156 to 175 m respectively cwrc 2010 2016 the reduction in the ratio of ss delivered to the tgr implies that an increase in the impounded water level demonstrated a significant retention effect on ss as well as pp even during the flood season in river systems part of dissolved phosphorus was adsorbed on suspended particles such as ss and then pp was reduced by particle deposition pan et al 2013 moreover fine particles generally tend to adsorb more dissolved phosphorus than coarse particles because of the larger surface area in a unit mass of particles yao et al 2016 lager particle size d 50 of ss with higher pp concentrations in water column simultaneously occurred in upper river reaches where water column contained high ss and tp loads fig 2 and table 4 however when related the d 50 to tp content in ss they are negatively correlated with coefficients of 0 34 which demonstrated that fine particles contained relatively more phosphorus sedimentation was described as the primary mechanism of the deposition of fine particles wang et al 2009 in general fine particles existed as clay and silt was the dominant constituent of ss in the mainstream section of the tgr wu et al 2016 the results from the static sedimentation experiment indicate that the ss concentration and water physicochemical properties were closely related to pp sedimentation performance table 4 indicates that the particle size d50 and zeta potential were negatively and positively related to t 1 2 of pp sedimentation that was obtained from the pseudo second order kinetic model respectively sedimentation velocity of fine particles is the key parameter for evaluating the ss and pp carrying capacity li et al 2016 conducted field measurements of settling velocities of fine sediments in zx and fj using acoustic doppler velocimeter during the flood season and found that most of the effective settling velocities were within the range of 0 1 10 mm s however the median particle diameters in the tgr are 4 10 μm and thus the corresponding settling velocities were 0 01 0 09 mm s based on stokes equation li et al 2016a b assumed the ss sampled in zx and fj in this study were settled with above velocities the calculated t 1 2 equal to settlement distance of 30 cm in static sedimentation process ranged between 56 and 500 min which seems lower than 122 min zx and 42 min fj in table 2 it is implicated that static conditions were much favorable for the flocculation and sedimentations process than field natural water flow conditions retention of sediment particles with a median diameter larger than 0 01 mm dominated the ss sedimentation process in the tgr li et al 2016a b in general pp contained in ss with a large particle size is more prone to settlement due to its relatively high density a previous study indicated that fine sand in the tgr with a median particle size larger than 0 01 mm had a much higher dry density 0 70 g cm3 than fine silt 0 50 60 g cm3 with the d50 values ranging from 0 005 to 0 01 mm zhang 2013 pp contained in ss obtained from the lower river reaches had a smaller particles size and stronger cohesive properties fig 4 and its sedimentation process was primarily dependent on flocculation performance absolute values of the zeta potential can be used to evaluate the influence of flocculation on pp sedimentation in this study the absolute value of the zeta potential was between 10 and 20 mv which lies in the unstable range of 10 30 mv for colloid flocculation thurøcarstensen et al 1972 if the absolute value of the zeta potential is considerably high the difficultly of colloid sedimentation is increased arias et al 2008 ss obtained from lower river reaches generally has a much higher absolute value of the zeta potential than that obtained in upper river reaches table 1 which may increase the period for achieving balanced conditions for pp sedimentation moreover pp is mostly bound to negatively charged ss as negative charges of ss in the water column increase electrostatic repulsion is generated to prevent the flocculation of fine particles to medium and large sized particles and the sedimentation of pp is thus delayed 4 2 change in pp bioavailability measured 0 945 1 159 mg g tp content in ss for 11 mainstream sampling sites 10 in tgr and 1behined tgd was comparable to that reported 1 04 1 52 mg g for 7 sampling sites 4 in tg and 3 in tributaries han et al 2018 but was obviously higher than 0 904 0 105 mg kg tp in the bs wu et al 2016 various phosphorus fractions in ss have various bioavailabilities fe p or al p can be exchanged with oh and other inorganic phosphorus compounds and can be used for the evaluation of algal available phosphorus zhou et al 2001 ca p was reported to be a relatively stable fraction especially in neutral and alkaline environments jin et al 2006 and was attributed to the permanent burial of phosphorus within sediment particles org p was indicated to represent the phosphorus fraction bound to organic matter which directly affected the availability levels of dissolved phosphorus for phytoplankton growth edlund and carman 2001 for the ss of the 11 sampling sites in the tgr phosphorus was mainly of detrital origin ca p whereas minor fe al p originated more from anthropogenic sources wu et al 2011 moreover nearly 28 of fe al p contained in ss was significantly higher than approximately 19 in bs wu et al 2016 it is indicated that ss has much stronger affinity of phosphorus than bs in the tgr impoundment greatly changed the content of tp and its fractions bound to ss from the tail to the front area of the tgr tp and bioavailable phosphorus bio p fractions fe p or al p org p tended to increase which exhibited an opposite trend to the corresponding distribution of the ss concentrations fig 4 compared with cq the tp and bio p contents in zg increased to 18 87 and 26 66 respectively from the tail to the front area of the tgr silt gradually replaced sand and subsequently constituted the dominant portion of ss wu et al 2016 in general fine silt has a much higher specific area and metal oxide content than sand and can adsorb much more dissolved phosphorus than coarse particles tang et al 2014 yao et al 2016 therefore ss in lower river reaches contained much higher bio p than that in the upper river reaches an increased bio p content in fine particles and a lower flow velocity in the lower fl of the tgr greatly favored the growth of harmful algae and consequently promoted blooms in this area zhang et al 2012 compared with natural river channel conditions the tp and fe p or al p contents increased by more than two and eight times respectively fig 4 this can be attributed to two major reasons the first is the reduction in the size of particles entering the tgr the mean particle size of ss in the mainstream section of the tgr decreased from 0 011 to 0 009 mm between 2003 and 2010 when compared with the values in the 1990s and that in yc decreased from 0 009 mm between 1987 and 2002 to 0 004 mm between 2003 and 2010 crwc 2000 2016 the decline in particle size facilitated ss adsorption and fixed a greater amount of phosphorus the second reason is the increase in soluble phosphorus availability to ss metal oxides and hydroxides were revealed to be the major components of the fine particles in the sediment of the tgr ding et al 2013 and they have been reported to exhibit a high phosphate adsorption capacity cotovicz et al 2014 and to engender an increase in the content of bio p and tp in fine sediment when compared with that in the coarse particles zhu et al 2013 from 1996 to 2014 the annual domestic wastewater discharge volume from the tgr region increased from less than 0 25 to approximately 0 80 billion tons and the average phosphorus fertilizer consumption increased to 16 during the same period zhuo et al 2017 in china the discharge standard for phosphorus for municipal wastewater is higher than 1 0 mg l mep 2002 therefore domestic wastewater discharge results in 800 tons of soluble phosphorus input annually which greatly promotes the adsorption and combination of phosphors to fine ss particles in the tgr ss has strong affinity to dissolved phosphorus due to their high specific surface areas and surface active sites fang et al 2013 previous study indicated that phosphorus adsorption capacity was 135 mg kg for the bs of tgr with the experimental sediment and phosphorus concentrations of 2 0 g l and 0 50 mg l respectively cao et al 2011 when compared to the average ss loads 0 1 g l and tdp 0 1 mg l concentrations in this study figs 2 and 4 the amount of dissolved phosphorus adsorbed to the ss may be negligible in contrast to approximately 1000 mg kg p content in ss the partition coefficient k d is defined as the ratio between the concentrations of pp and tdp and also used as an indicator for evaluating the capability of sediment to retain p evgeny et al 2014 huang et al 2017 fitted the k d well to the ss concentrations in the tgr with the following equation 1 k d 4 2242 s 0 701 r 2 0 527 in this study calculated k d ranged between 0 16 and 0 68 with equation 1 based on measured ss concentrations however the actual k d range was 0 18 1 73 when determined with pp and tdp data in fig 2 and ss in upper river reaches has much higher k d than that in lower river reaches the possible reason maybe that k d is not a simple function of ss and greatly varies at a certain ss loads huang et al 2017 relatively high ss loads abundant tdp supply and low zeta potential absolute values may facilitate the adsorption and flocculation of dissolved p into ss in the upper river reaches 4 3 contribution of pp sedimentation to eutrophication a high level of water impoundment was revealed to result in a decline in the flow velocity along the mainstream section of the changjiang river zhou et al 2015 and ss sedimentation correspondingly lead to a significant deposition of pp consequently increasing the water transparency the river reaches between cq and zg were the major deposition areas for ss and were the main accumulation areas for bio p wu et al 2016 the internal release of p has a flux in the range of 0 15 2 55 mg m 2 a 1 niu et al 2013 wang et al 2015 which had a minor contribution to the entire phosphorus loads in the water column however accompanied by the settlement of ss pp concentrations in the water column were decreased from 0 34 mg l in cq to 0 02 mg l in zg fig 2 pp sedimentation also changed the ratio of pp to srp from cq to zg the ratio of srp to pp gradually increased from 25 51 to 153 38 moreover except for the bd sampling sites the srp concentrations at the other nine sampling sites in the tgr exceeded 0 02 mg l which is a critical value of phosphorus loads for algae blooms tang et al 2014 therefore low ss contents and sufficient srp concentrations may greatly enhance the bioavailability of phosphorus to algae thus creating favorable conditions for the outburst of water blooms dam retention and ss deposition in the tgr reduced water column particle contents and subsequently decreased the combined capacity of water column soluble phosphorus to ss moreover massive anthropic input of industrial and domestic wastewater causes the tgr to receive a substantial amount of soluble phosphorus zhuo et al 2017 specifically impoundment fueled the water eutrophication in the tgr not only on a temporal scale but also on a spatial scale long term monitoring of data indicated that water blooms mainly occurred between march and july after the impounded water level was initially135 m however the period for water bloom outburst extended to between march and october after the impounded water level exceeded 156 m cnemc 1998 2016 moreover water blooms occurred in no more than three tributaries since the first impoundment to 135 m subsequently nearly 11 to 22 tributaries were frequently subjected to water blooms after impoundment to 175 m fig 6 which accounted for between 1 3 and 2 3 of the total tributaries in the tgr notably increasing the impoundment level can reduce the number of eutrophic tributaries in the current year but may dramatically increase the number of eutrophic tributaries in the following several years fig 6 increasing the impoundment level in autumn restrained the autumn water bloom outburst mainly due to a diluting effect of nutrient and a low water temperature in the earlier winter but encouraged the spring water bloom due to the reduction in water flow and ss improvement in water transparency increase in temperature and availability of water column nutrients combined from the external input and internal releases from a newly submerged area xiao et al 2017 furthermore the trophic status of the tgr changed on the basis of an impoundment accident the proportions of oligotrophic sections sharply decreased from 20 38 in 2005 to 0 32 in 2011 additionally the proportion of slight moderate and heavy eutrophication sections significantly increased from 19 23 in 2005 to 39 53 in 2011 fig 6 therefore the risk of water blooms generally increased in the tgr due to the increase in the impounded water level once the water column nutrient concentrations exceeded their threshold values for eutrophication suitable temperature slow flow and excellent transparency may play important roles in the outburst of water bloom xu et al 2009 ji et al 2017 previous study found that constant water level and high temperature led to the stability and thermal stratification of the daning rvier a tributary of tgr and thus resulted in a high phytoplankton biomass zhu et al 2013 however other researchers argued that water temperature in the tgr ranged between 8 0 c and 29 0 c which is quite suitable for the growth and development of phytoplankton in particular of diatom and cyptophyta dai et al 2010 ji et al 2017 so water temperature can not be regarded as the limited factor for water bloom reduction in water flow greatly favored the propagation of majority algae species slowing down of the flow velocity in the mainstream and branches nearby the tgd will diminish the restrain of rapid stream on the growth of algae to some extent and such water flow condition even can be developed to encourage the growth of some slow flow or stagnant water favored algae species such as bacillariophyta s cyclotella and pyrophyta s prridiniaceae dai et al 2010 moreover due to decline in upstream ss input and efficiently ss sedimentation in the tgr mao et al 2012 increased water column transparency may significantly promote the photosynthesis of phytoplankton and drastically augmented the algae biomass xu et al 2009 ji et al 2017 therefore reduction nutrient input from the three gorges region as well as its upstream areas and improvement of the hydrodynamic conditions of the tgr via optimizing the operation mode were both needed for eutrophicaiton control and algae bloom prevention retention of ss and pp also greatly changed the natural balance relationship among the water flow ss and nutrient content of the lower reaches behind the tgd comparing yc with cq revealed that 76 25 of ss and 75 35 of pp were trapped in the tgr due to tgd figs 2 and 4 moreover historical statistic results indicated that the amount of sediment discharged between 2003 and 2010 decreased to 93 when compared with the values obtained between 1991 and 2002 cwrc 2000 2016 an increase in the impounded water level caused an annual sediment deposition volume increase from 12 40 million tons in 2003 to 19 60 million tons in 2010 fig 7 due to water and soil conservation in the upstream and ss trapped by tgd the discharged ss volume and its concentrations tended to decrease as shown in fig 8 the annual total discharged ss loads and the corresponding mean concentrations decreased from 22 80 million tons and 578 mg l in 2002 before impoundment to 8 50 million tones and 20 mg l in 2016 respectively inadequate supplementation of ss to the lower reaches behind the tgd causes a high ratio of soluble nutrient discharge from the tgr moreover external input from surrounding point and nonpoint sources may provide overdosed bioavailable phosphorus and reduce the corresponding water environmental buffer capacity for phosphorus in the downstream river reaches and in the corresponding naturally connected lakes such as the dongting lake and poyang lake guo et al 2011 evaluated the effects of the impoundment of the tgr on the water environmental capacity of the poyang lake and found that the annual average po4 3 concentration increased from 0 060 mg l in 2003 to 0 215 mg l in 2009 which is closely related to the change in water sediment transportation due to the impoundment of the tgr and subsequently increased the risk of water blooms in the warm dry season 5 conclusions tgd caused obvious trapping effects on ss and pp even during the flood season under a low water level tgd caused 76 25 of ss and 75 35 of pp to be trapped in the tgr due to retention and deposition as observed through a comparison of cq and yc pp was the major component of tp the pp concentration dramatically decreased along the mainstream section of the tgr moreover pp concentrations gradually dropped from 0 35 mg l in cq to 0 02 mg l in zg due to the reduction in water flow velocity particle size d50 of ss was negatively r2 034 but positively r2 0 92 related to tp content in ss and pp concentrations in water column respectively pp has a sedimentation behavior that is similar to ss the derived pseudo second order equations fitted the ss and pp sedimentation process much better than the pseudo first order kinetic models did more than 50 of pp sedimentation could be obtained in less than 60 min for the upper cq cs and fl sampling sites and exhibited corresponding settlement velocities of no more than 0 01 mm s under static conditions the t 1 2 value of pp sedimentation was negatively and positively related to the median particle size and absolute value of the water column s zeta potential respectively compared with natural river conditions impoundment due to tgd resulted in a significant reduction in ss concentrations median particle size of ss and total discharged loads to the lower river reaches such as yc moreover the amount of tp and fe al p bound to ss particles was several times higher than that obtained before the impoundment of the reservoir with an increase in the impounded water level the ss content tended to decrease moreover suitable water temperature slow water flow excellent water transparency and abundant soluble phosphorus input promoted the water bloom outburst in a higher number of tributaries for longer periods

19527,the aquatic environment is continually exposed to a complex mixture of chemicals whereby effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps are one key source the aim of the present study was to investigate whether environmental risk assessments eras addressing individual substances are sufficiently protective for such coincidental mixtures based on a literature review of chemicals reported to occur in municipal wwtp effluents and mode of action considerations four different types of mixtures were composed containing human pharmaceuticals pesticides and chemicals regulated under reach the experimentally determined chronic aquatic toxicity of these mixtures towards primary producers and the invertebrate daphnia magna could be adequately predicted by the concept of concentration addition with up to 5 fold overestimation and less than 3 fold underestimation of mixture toxicity effluents of a municipal wwtp had no impact on the predictability of mixture toxicity and showed no adverse effects on the test organisms predictive eras for the individual mixture components based on here derived predicted no effect concentrations pnecs and median measured concentrations in wwtp effluents mceff indicated no unacceptable risk for any of the individual chemicals while mceff pnec summation indicated a possible risk for multi component mixtures however a refined mixture assessment based on the sum of toxic units at species level indicated no unacceptable risks and allowed for a safety margin of more than factor 10 not taking into account any dilution of wwtp effluents by surface waters individual substances namely climbazole fenofibric acid and fluoxetine were dominating the risks of the investigated mixtures while added risk due to the mixture was found to be low with the risk quotient being increased by less than factor 2 yet uncertainty remains regarding chronic mixture toxicity in fish which was not included in the present study the number and identity of substances composing environmental mixtures such as wwtp effluents is typically unknown therefore a mixture assessment factor is discussed as an option for a prospective era of mixtures of unknown composition graphical abstract image 1 keywords chronic aquatic toxicity fungicides pharmaceuticals flame retardant corrosion inhibitor mixture risk assessment 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps represent systems where chemicals from various sources merge and after their degradation and transformation are released as mixture into the environment for the aquatic environment effluents of wwtps thereby represent a key point source for unintentional and coincidental mixtures of chemicals the environmental risk assessment era for chemicals has traditionally been conducted on a single substance basis within different regulatory frameworks e g human pharmaceuticals pesticides biocides and chemicals regulated under reach such a single substance era is extending towards an era of intentional mixtures in some of these frameworks jrc 2014 yet there is currently no regulation addressing a prospective era of coincidental mixtures of micro pollutants as represented by wwtp effluents kienzler et al 2016 the summation of risk quotients such as the ratios of predicted environmental concentration and predicted no effect concentration pec pnec ratios provides a simple and pragmatic approach for a prospective mixture risk assessment and has been proposed for different regulatory frameworks e g echa 2014 frische et al 2014 jrc 2014 backhaus 2016 this approach is generally more conservative than applying the concept of concentration addition ca separately for identical endpoints or species as explained in detail by backhaus and faust 2012 hence applying ca based on the sum of toxic units stu calculated separately for identical endpoints or at least trophic levels could represent a refinement step if unacceptable risk could not be excluded by pec pnec summation jrc 2014 a few studies applied this tiered approach already to wwtp effluents or surface water samples using predicted escher et al 2011 or measured substance concentrations backhaus and karlsson 2014 thomaidi et al 2015 as exposure estimates these and other studies addressing mixture toxicity in the aquatic environment e g santos et al 2013 ginebreda et al 2014 relied on acute toxicity endpoints due to unavailability of chronic endpoints for many of the individual mixture components yet the regulatory era of human pharmaceuticals as one key group of biologically active micro pollutants in wastewater is required to be based on chronic toxicity data ema 2006 the most sensitive species and the resulting pnec can differ considerably when acute instead of chronic endpoints are used this is illustrated by the dataset for human pharmaceuticals from vestel et al 2016 where in 32 out of 60 cases the chronic and the acute pnec for the same substance were derived from species of different trophic levels so far there is some though still limited evidence that ca provides reasonably good estimates not only for acute but also for chronic effects in aquatic organisms hermens et al 1984 coors et al 2014 hassold and backhaus 2014 watanabe et al 2016 the present study therefore focussed on chronic aquatic toxicity also in view of the almost constant discharge from wwtps the aim of the present study was to experimentally investigate the applicability of ca for a predictive era of mixtures of micro pollutants in wwtp effluents and to compare single substance and mixture era based on currently proposed approaches for this purpose mixtures of up to ten substances known or expected to occur in wwtp effluents were tested for aquatic chronic toxicity in two primary producers and one invertebrate additionally the influence of wwtp effluent on the predictability of mixture toxicity was investigated measured concentrations in wwtp effluents mceff served as exposure estimate in the single substance and mixture assessments 2 material methods 2 1 selection of substances and mixtures the rationale for the selection of the individual components in the investigated mixtures was dominated by exposure considerations an extensive review of literature studies published between 2002 and 2012 produced a list of more than 500 chemicals reported to frequently occur in the effluents of municipal wwtps and surface waters in europe eight substances were selected among these for the present study the fungicidal human pharmaceutical fluconazole the anti depressant fluoxetine the beta blocker metoprolol the fungicide climbazole regulated under reach and contained e g in anti dandruff shampoo the flame retardant tris 2 chloropropyl phosphate tcpp the corrosion inhibitor 5 methylbenzotriazole 5 mbt the fungicidal preservative methylparaben used in personal care products and the fungicide propiconazole authorized as biocide and plant protection product in the european union eu three more human pharmaceuticals were selected for which no or few published data on occurrence in european municipal wwtp effluents were available but consumption data indicated potential presence in the environment these were the calcium channel blocker amlodipine the lipid modifying agent fenofibric acid an active pharmaceutical ingredient api on its own as well as the active metabolite of fenofibrate and the antibiotic linezolid in addition to the occurrence in wwtp effluents the dis similarity of the intended mode of action moa of the compounds was considered during the selection process in order to challenge ca based mixture predictions compounds were preferably selected which are known inhibitors of the detoxifying cytochrome p450 system because this may increase the likelihood of synergistic interactions in the mixture cedergreen 2014 the assumed or known sensitivity of the pre selected test species primary producers and one aquatic invertebrate were additionally taken into account for selecting the compounds and composing the individual test mixtures aiming to include the most relevant chemicals in a mixture test with a given species since testing mixtures in fish was beyond the scope of the present study no substances were selected for which fish can be assumed to be particularly sensitive e g estrogens or suspected endocrine disruptors in addition to the individual selected substances the following conceptionally different mixtures were experimentally tested in the present study a three components with similar moa mixture of the three azoles fluconazole propiconazole and climbazole to represent mixtures of components with a similar intended moa inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis by binding to c 14 demethylase that are regulated in different regulatory frameworks this mixture was tested at an equipotent concentration ratio of the components in green algae and the aquatic invertebrate d magna and as only mixture also in the water lentil l minor because of its known high sensitivity for azoles richter et al 2013 b three components with dissimilar moa mixture of climbazole amlodipine and metoprolol to represent mixtures of components with a dissimilar intended moa this mixture was tested only in green algae at an equipotent concentration ratio c multiple components 9 10 at an equipotent concentration ratio mixture of the three azoles climbazole fluconazole and propiconazole three chemicals regulated under reach tcpp 5 mbt and methylparaben and two more pharmaceuticals fluoxetine and metoprolol when tested in green algae it contained additionally amlodipine and the antibiotic linezolid 10 components in total but fenofibric acid when tested in d magna 9 components in total this difference in mixture composition reflects the differences in sensitivity of the two species towards these three substances d multiple components 9 10 at an exposure related concentration ratio mixture of the same components and tested in the same species as in c with the difference that the relative proportions of the components were based on their median concentrations in wwtp effluents as evidenced by the literature review in order to evaluate whether the wwtp effluent matrix and the plethora of substances therein would interfere with the mixture toxicity predictions as proposed e g by frische et al 2009 several of the above listed mixture compositions a b and c were tested in parallel with and without municipal wwtp effluent mixed into the medium 2 2 exposure estimates determination of mceff values since production volumes of chemicals regulated under reach are confidential predicted environmental concentrations pecs were not available for several substances of the present study therefore measured concentrations in municipal wwtp effluents mceff were compiled and used in the era no factor accounting for dilution by surface waters was applied the data compiled from literature studies were complemented by repeated measurements of the effluent of a municipal wwtp which was also used in some mixture experiments details on the investigated wwtp and the analytical results are provided in the supplements from all compiled data median and 90 percentiles were derived as descriptors of the statistical distribution of the concentrations of each chemical non detects were treated as zero values in the statistical evaluation 2 3 test substances test substances were purchased from dr ehrenstorfer sigma aldrich tokyo chemical industry or toronto research chemicals at a purity of 95 for some pharmaceuticals salts were used as test item in the tests see details in supplements yet all concentrations and toxicity estimates relate to the active moiety of the api i e the free base or acid and not to the salt single substance and mixture tests were conducted within a period of 2 years during which regular tests with reference substances demonstrated unaltered sensitivity of the used test organisms in all tests the substances were directly dissolved in the test medium without using dispersants or solvents 2 4 growth inhibition tests with the water plant lemna minor growth inhibition tests with l minor were performed according to oecd guideline 221 in a geometric dilution series with a spacing factor not exceeding 3 2 six concentrations three replicates each were tested along with a control six replicates the erc10 concentration with 10 effect on growth rate based on frond numbers and determined after 7 days of static exposure was used as key endpoint temperature was between 22 c and 25 4 c and ph ranged from 5 7 to 7 7 in the absence and from 8 5 to 9 4 in the presence of wwtp effluent the ph value changed only in one individual test with mixture a with 1 8 units slightly more than the limit of 1 5 units allowed by the guideline as these deviations are only minor they are not deemed to invalidate the test results all tests in the present study fulfilled the validity criteria of the oecd 221 guideline with regard to the doubling time of frond number in the control less than 2 5 days corresponding to an about 7 fold increase of frond number in seven days and a growth rate of 0 275 per day 2 5 growth inhibition tests with the green algae raphidocelis subcapitata in all tests r subcapitata formerly known as pseudokirchneriella subcapitata or selenastrum capricornutum was statically exposed for a test period of 72 h according to oecd guideline 201 erc10 was selected as key endpoint concentration response tests were conducted with seven concentration levels three replicates each separated by a spacing factor of 3 2 or less and a control six replicates each replicate vessel 100 ml test solution was inoculated with 0 5 104 cells ml taken from an exponentially growing pre culture vessels were continuously shaken during the exposure under permanent light at an intensity of 60 120 μe m 2 s 1 as confirmed by measurements across all tests temperature ranged between 20 2 and 24 c and ph between 7 3 and 10 2 due to strong growth the change of the ph during the exposure period occasionally exceeded in the controls and at low test concentrations the maximum of 1 5 ph units allowed by the guideline maximum change of 2 4 units since no impact on growth was observed these slight deviations from the prescribed ph range are not deemed to have any impact on the reliability of the results all tests of the present study fulfilled the validity criteria of the oecd 201 guideline with regard to the mean biomass increase at least 16 fold induction and the coefficient of variation of growth rate in the controls equal or less than 7 2 6 reproduction tests with the freshwater crustacean daphnia magna d magna reproduction tests were conducted according to oecd guideline 211 as semi static exposure with eleven replicate vessels for the control and ten replicate vessels for each of the five to seven concentration levels separated by a spacing factor between 1 4 and 3 2 ec10 of reproduction measured as cumulative number of living offspring produced

with oecd 211 the temperature range prescribed by the guideline 18 22 c controlled at 1 c was occasionally slightly exceeded minimum of 16 0 c maximum of 24 2 c while oxygen content ph 7 7 8 8 and light intensity were in all tests in the recommended range as confirmed by repeated measurements survival and number of living offspring per female were recorded daily all tests in the present study fulfilled the validity criteria of the oecd guideline 211 i e 20 or less mortality of control females until the end of the test and at least 60 offspring per surviving female in the control this last criterion was achieved in the test with metoprolol only after prolongation of the test period until day 22 2 7 testing mixtures in absence and presence of wwtp effluents all mixtures were tested as geometric dilution series of a stock solution i e at a fixed ratio of the mixture component concentrations in order to test mixtures in parallel in absence and presence of wwtp effluent 24 h composite samples from a municipal wwtp were collected and either used in the tests within 12 h algae or stored refrigerated for up to 5 days d magna l minor each mixture concentration level in the dilution series with wwtp effluent consequently contained 50 effluent in the test solution i e the effluent was not diluted along the mixture dilution series from a twofold concentrated stock solution prepared in twofold concentrated culture medium of the respective test organism one dilution series was prepared using deionized water and culture medium absence of effluent and a second series with identical dilution steps using the wwtp effluent and standard culture medium presence of effluent thereby it was ensured that both dilution series presence and absence of effluent originated from the same stock solution and contained essential elements and nutrients at least at the concentrations prescribed by the guideline there were always two test substance free controls standard culture medium medium control and twofold concentrated standard culture medium diluted 1 1 with effluent effluent control 2 8 analytical measurements of chemicals in all single substance and mixture tests the concentrations of all test substances in the exposure solutions at test start were verified by analytical measurement of the lowest a medium and the highest concentration level in some cases substances were additionally analyzed after 2 3 three days of exposure to confirm constant concentrations during the test analysis of the test substances was done by direct injection into a hplc ms ms system liquid chromatograph 1260 infinity from agilent technologies waldbronn germany coupled via an electrospray interface to an api 5500 tandem mass spectrometer ab sciex langen germany if needed due to low test concentrations solid phase extraction on a polymeric material strata x from phenomenex aschaffenburg germany was used for pre concentration quantification was done against an external calibration in test medium 2 9 data analysis data of concentration dependent growth rate and reproduction were fitted by non linear modelling with the free software r version 3 2 2 r development core team 2013 using the most recent version of the package drc ritz et al 2015 in most cases a 3 parameter log logistic function achieved good fits while in some cases a 5 parameter or 3 parameter weibull model produced better fits effect concentrations with 10 and 50 effect were derived from the fitted models and their 95 confidence intervals were obtained with the implemented function ed of the drc package using the delta method and the t distribution concentration response curves determined in absence and presence of wwtp effluent were compared with each other using the ratio test wheeler et al 2006 for each pair of fitted model parameters if the parameters of two concentration response curves did not significantly differ in the ratio test two sided alpha 0 05 the curves were deemed to not differ significantly lowest observed effect concentrations loec and no observed effect concentrations noec are additionally reported in the supplements toxicity estimates were derived based on nominal concentrations and corrected for measured concentrations if they deviated by more than 20 from nominal test concentrations 2 10 mixture calculations the toxicity of each mixture was predicted for the ec10 according to the ca concept as e c 10 m i x 1 c i c i e c 10 i with ci as concentration of each compound i in the mixture in addition the toxic units tui and the related sum of toxic units stu as a measure for the relative contribution of each component to the overall toxicity were calculated as t u i c i e c 10 i as measure for the compliance between predicted and observed toxicity the model deviation ratio mdr introduced by belden et al 2007 was calculated for each toxicity estimate as m d r p r e d i c t e d e c 10 o b s e r v e d e c 10 an mdr above 1 indicates that the toxicity of the mixture is underestimated by the ca prediction while an mdr below 1 indicates that it is overestimated an mdr between 0 5 and 2 i e indicating a deviation between prediction and observation of up to factor 2 has been interpreted as indicating compliance with ca given the inherent variability of biological test results belden et al 2007 cedergreen et al 2008 coors and frische 2011 cedergreen 2014 mdr values for acute toxicity based on ec50 for algal growth inhibition were calculated additionally and reported in the supplements 2 11 derivation of pnecs and risk quotients based on the results of the present study and literature data pnecs were derived for the 11 substances using an assessment factor af adapted to the data available for species from different trophic levels ecb 2003 risk quotients were calculated as ratio between mceff and pnec for the single substances for the mixtures mceff pnec ratios were summed for a first tier assessment while summed mceff ec10 ratios for individual test organisms served as risk quotients in a second tier assessment 3 results discussion in the following the derived estimates for exposure and effects to be used in a risk assessment are described and discussed first subsequently predictability of chronic mixture toxicity and the differences between a single substance and a mixture risk assessment are addressed 3 1 concentrations of the selected chemicals in wwtp effluents table 1 summarizes the key results from the statistical evaluation of the compiled occurrence data for amlodipine fenofibric acid and linezolid the present study is among the first to report concentrations in a municipal wwtp effluent the antibiotic linezolid was only detected once while amlodipine and fenofibric acid were detected in all four analyzed samples in a concentration above the limit of detection 0 01 μg l concentrations measured in the present study details provided in the supplements were in the range of those reported in literature e g for fenofibric acid and metoprolol ternes et al 2007 rosal et al 2010 as well as for tcpp and fluconazole loos et al 2013 this confirms that the effluent used in the toxicity tests can be regarded as sufficiently representative for municipal wwtp effluents fluoxetine represented an outlier since the concentrations reported by loos et al 2013 for european wwtp effluents were about 10 fold lower than those compiled for mostly north american wwtp effluents due to a lack of published data on fluoxetine concentrations in european wastewaters the concentrations measured in effluent samples of one municipal wwtp in the present study median of 0 024 μg l however did not support a generally 10 fold lower fluoxetine concentration in european compared to north american wwtp effluents methylparaben was not detected in the effluents measured in the present study which agrees with the frequent non detects reported in the literature 3 2 confirmation of actual test concentrations and mixture compositions in the biotests chemical analysis detailed results in the supplement of test solutions at test start confirmed less than 20 deviation from nominal concentrations in all single substance tests of the present study except for propiconazole and metoprolol tested in l minor in the mixture tests concentrations of some components deviated occasionally slightly more than 20 from the nominal concentrations in all these cases observed and predicted toxicity estimates were accordingly corrected and relate to measured initial concentrations constant concentrations under test conditions were checked in one multi component test with algae and all three multi component tests with d magna the results indicated that fluconazole climbazole propiconazole tcpp 5 mbt metoprolol fenofibric acid except in one test and linezolid did not dissipate from the test solutions since at least 80 of initial measured concentration was detected after 2 3 days of exposure this is in agreement with previous findings for fluconazole climbazole richter et al 2013 2016 and metoprolol dzialowski et al 2006 hence it can be assumed that these substances are generally stable under the exposure conditions and that toxicity estimates can be based on nominal or initial measured concentrations amlodipine and fluoxetine showed some dissipation 35 68 recovery of initial measured concentrations while methylparaben concentrations in aged exposure solutions were consistently below the limit of detection however the dissipation of these substances during the exposure did not impact the mixture toxicity predictions based on initial measured concentrations because there is no reason to expect that dissipation differed between single substance and mixture tests only the single substance estimate for fluoxetine takes into account concentrations measured at the end of the exposure oakes et al 2010 therefore fluoxetine concentrations in the mixture tests were as well corrected for time weighted average concentrations 3 3 aquatic chronic toxicity of the individual substances and derived pnecs the toxicity estimates of the individual substances that were used in mixture predictions are summarized in table 2 for most substances complete concentration response curves were obtained see supplements and ec10 values with mostly very tight confidence intervals could be derived no effects were detected up to the highest tested concentration of methylparaben and 5 mbt on d magna reproduction and of metoprolol on growth of l minor the ec10 of tcpp for d magna reproduction was slightly extrapolated beyond the lowest tested concentration based on a clear concentration response curve for some substances as indicated in table 2 estimates for the key endpoints were taken from the literature there are no data available regarding long term fish toxicity for tcpp 5 mbt methylparaben amlodipine fenofibric acid and linezolid while the present study provides chronic endpoints for two trophic levels hence an af of 100 was applied to the here determined lowest ec10 of these substances to derive the pnec similarly no long term fish toxicity data are available in the literature for the azoles climbazole and fluconazole while acute toxicity is considerably less for fish than for primary producers chen and ying 2015 the water plant l minor clearly represented the most sensitive endpoint for both fluconazole and climbazole since chronic toxicity data are available for two trophic levels among them the presumably most sensitive one an af of 50 was used for deriving these pnecs for propiconazole none of the ec10 values derived in the present study was lower than the noec listed for fish in the most recent regulatory assessment of propiconazole as biocide sc 2015 the pnec was accordingly derived from this noec using an af of 10 because chronic data are available for three trophic levels for metoprolol moermond and smit 2016 recently proposed an environmental quality standard eqs of 62 μg l relying on a 9 day toxicity test in daphnia as most sensitive endpoint with an af of 50 as this daphnia test was classified as semi chronic only the ec10 for daphnia reproduction determined in the present study is lower than chronic toxicity data for other trophic levels moermond and smit 2016 and present study which supports using this guideline conform daphnia ec10 with an af of 10 table 1 similar to metoprolol there are numerous studies available on the chronic aquatic toxicity of fluoxetine justifying an af of 10 applied to the estimate for algal toxicity as most sensitive endpoint oakes et al 2010 overall the pnecs for the individual substances ranged from 0 1 μg l to 610 μg l 3 4 predictability of mixture toxicity for chronic endpoints in absence and presence of wwtp effluent the equipotent three component mixtures caused clear concentration dependent responses of the key endpoints fig 1 a d there was no significant difference between the parameters of the models fitted to responses observed in absence and presence of wwtp effluent all p 0 05 only tested with primary producers there was also no adverse effect of the diluted wwtp effluent on primary producers as demonstrated by the controls note that the background concentrations in the wwtp effluent table s2 were not included in the mixture predictions since they were well below the test concentrations most concentration response curves for the three component mixtures did not differ much from the respective curves predicted by ca dotted lines in fig 1 the mdr values determined as quantitative measure of deviation table 3 indicated up to 5 fold overestimation of mixture toxicity with the greatest deviations being observed in algae and the smallest ones in d magna mixture toxicity was underestimated though by less than a factor of 3 for one mixture tested in algae it is remarkable that the only case of mixture toxicity underestimation by ca occurred for the mixture of components with dissimilar moa fig 1d for which according to theory altenburger et al 2004 the ia model would be more appropriate while the ca model should rather overestimate mixture toxicity this indicates that the slight deviation between prediction and observation was not related to the choice of the mixture model possible reasons are rather inherent variability of biological responses and the relatively poor model fit at the low effect level which could not be further improved beyond the finally applied 4 parameter weibull model correction for initial measured concentrations of the mixture components resulted mostly in mdr values closer to 1 i e better compliance between predicted and observed toxicity of the three component mixtures the tests with the multi component mixtures in green algae and daphnia achieved also clear concentration response curves fig 2 a d the toxicity of these mixtures was in no case underestimated and less than 3 fold overestimated by the ca prediction fig 2 table 3 as with the 3 component mixtures the compliance between predicted and observed toxicity slightly increased when measured test concentrations were used data not shown in accordance with the 3 component mixture tests no influence of the wwtp effluent on the concentration response curve was observed for r subcapitata for d magna however only two of the three parameters did not differ significantly curve steepness and ec50 while the upper limit as third parameter differed significantly p 0 001 hence at control or low exposure conditions the reproduction of d magna was significantly enhanced by the presence of 50 wwtp effluent in the test solution this finding is in agreement with previous studies and most likely relates to improved food conditions for the filter feeder d magna due to the bacterial loading of the effluent as discussed elsewhere schlüter vorberg et al 2017 mdr values calculated for acute toxicity of all tested mixtures i e based on ec50 values table s8 in supplements indicated good compliance with ca predictions less than 3 fold deviation the present study hence demonstrates that the aquatic toxicity of mixtures can not only be predicted for acute endpoints as it has been repeatedly shown see e g reviews by cedergreen 2014 and backhaus 2016 but also for sub chronic endpoints in various species the deviation between the predicted and observed chronic mixture toxicity appears to be in the range of that reported for acute endpoints where the majority of cases deviated less than two fold belden et al 2007 coors and frische 2011 a recent study of watanabe et al 2016 investigated the toxicity of 10 wastewater born substances in green algae ceriodaphnia dubia and fish embryos and also concluded that low effect level sub chronic endpoints can be sufficiently well predicted by ca toxicity was equally predictable by ca for mixtures with similar as well as dissimilar intended moa in the present study while this may be simply due to the fact that the predictions of these two models often do not greatly differ junghans et al 2006 it may also indicate that some or all of the substances actually exhibited a similar moa in the tested non target organisms i e non specific baseline toxicity as it has been discussed for micro pollutants in wastewater escher et al 2011 the matrix of wastewater effluent and the multitude of other substances present at low concentrations did not affect the performance of the test organisms nor did it impact the predictability of chronic mixture toxicity in the here conducted tests overall it can therefore be concluded that the ca model can be applied for mixture risk predictions of wwtp effluents with reasonably good reliability this holds at least for key chronic endpoints of primary producers and crustaceans which are required within the era of human pharmaceuticals however this conclusion does not necessarily extend to other species particularly for fish there is still a lack of chronic mixture toxicity studies as supporting evidence for the applicability of ca 3 5 risk quotients for single substances and their mixture the median mceff pnec ratios were below 1 for all single substances i e no unacceptable risk was indicated on a single substance level table 4 when using the more conservative 90 percentile of the mceff the risk quotient was above 1 only in the case of climbazole the sum of the mceff pnec ratios for the mixture of all eleven substances was above 1 when using the median as well as the 90 percentile mceff hence a possible risk was identified for the mixture by the first tier mceff pnec summation approach while a single substance assessment indicated mostly no unacceptable risk for wwtp effluents the species specific risk quotients table 4 which represent the toxic units of the individual substances at the 90 percentile mceff were all below 1 hence all of the substances would exhibit less than 10 effect on any of the species at a concentration equal to a conservative estimate of their municipal wwtp effluent concentration the sum of the single substance risk quotients was still below 1 for all three species which indicates likewise that the mixtures of 7 10 compounds depending on species would induce less than 10 effect the theoretical expectation for no measurable effects was confirmed by the experimental testing of mixtures composed of some of the eleven compounds as no adverse effects occurred at the mceff concentration range diluted wwtp effluent samples used as controls also exhibited no adverse effects on any of the tested species in terms of a risk assessment extrapolation to wwtp effluents in general can be assumed covered by using the conservative 90 percentile mceff value as exposure estimate regarding extrapolation to other species however an assessment factor should be applied the summed species specific risk quotients table 4 allowed for a safety margin i e potential size of an af of 1000 d magna or about 12 green algae before a 10 inhibition would be expected which is greater than the appropriate af in case of a complete dataset the here calculated risk quotients for single substances as well as mixtures do not include a factor accounting for dilution of wwtp effluent in receiving surface waters hence regardless of the question whether the current standard dilution factor of 10 is appropriate link et al 2017 risks for the aquatic environment resulting from combined effects of the considered compounds were already low without assuming dilution by surface water the mixture risk was driven by only few substances fluoxetine in the case of green algae fenofibric acid in the case of d magna and climbazole in the case of l minor this finding is in line with other publications that reported mixture risks to be dominated by few of the mixture s components e g price et al 2012 backhaus and karlsson 2014 gustavsson et al 2017 the maximum cumulative ratio mcr introduced by price and han 2011 relates the risk quotient of the most risky single substance to that of the mixture in order to quantify the added risks due to combined effects in the present study the mcr values ranged from 1 01 to 1 48 i e less than twofold increase due to combined effects which indicates low concern for mixture risks however the selection of compounds their identity number and concentration is crucially determining the outcome of any mixture assessment based on current knowledge deriving a representative or a priority mixture of micro pollutants in wwtp effluents appears an impossible task it would require reliable effluent concentration data for all chemicals possibly occurring in wastewater of which many may not have been subject of wwtp effluent monitoring programs yet this is illustrated by fenofibric acid which has so far not been prioritized for environmental risks in any study but has been ranked third based on individual risk quotients in the present study more so far unknown micro pollutants may occur in wwtp effluents at relevant concentrations one possibility to cover the additional risk of unknown components in a non defined mixture would be a mixture assessment factor maf as discussed earlier e g backhaus 2016 the maf would be applied in every single substance assessment as an additional assessment factor to account for mixture uncertainty apart from lacking justification to blame each substance in the same way for potential additional mixture risk independently of its actual or potential contribution the problem arises to establish an appropriate size of such a maf the so far available scarce evidence from mixture risk assessment studies indicates an at maximum 5 fold greater risk of environmental mixtures compared to their most risky single component price et al 2012 backhaus and karlsson 2014 carvalho et al 2014 this would support an maf of up to 5 or lower i e up to 2 when based on the chronic aquatic mixture toxicity evaluated in the present study 4 conclusions the present study provides ample evidence that the chronic aquatic toxicity of mixtures of diverse substances can be predicted by ca with less than 3 fold underestimation at least with regard to primary producers and invertebrates acknowledging that uncertainty remains regarding the predictability of chronic mixture toxicity in fish reliable prospective eras for mixtures of chemicals present in wwtp effluents could be conducted based on ca yet mixture toxicity concepts such as ca can only address mixtures that are clearly defined in terms of components and their concentrations hence the identification of all possibly relevant chemicals and their concentrations is warranted for a prospective quantitative era of wwtp effluents as mixtures this is hardly possible in view of the currently available data and may not be feasible in the future either given the great number of chemicals possibly occurring in wwtp effluents as substitute applying a mixture assessment factor to all single substance eras could account for combined effects from simultaneous exposures without the need to define all components the actual environmental mixtures however it must be acknowledged that the present study considering up to 11 components in a mixture and applying worst case assumptions did not indicate substantial i e less than two fold additional risk due to the mixture beyond that already posed by some of the individual mixture components acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the german

19527,the aquatic environment is continually exposed to a complex mixture of chemicals whereby effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps are one key source the aim of the present study was to investigate whether environmental risk assessments eras addressing individual substances are sufficiently protective for such coincidental mixtures based on a literature review of chemicals reported to occur in municipal wwtp effluents and mode of action considerations four different types of mixtures were composed containing human pharmaceuticals pesticides and chemicals regulated under reach the experimentally determined chronic aquatic toxicity of these mixtures towards primary producers and the invertebrate daphnia magna could be adequately predicted by the concept of concentration addition with up to 5 fold overestimation and less than 3 fold underestimation of mixture toxicity effluents of a municipal wwtp had no impact on the predictability of mixture toxicity and showed no adverse effects on the test organisms predictive eras for the individual mixture components based on here derived predicted no effect concentrations pnecs and median measured concentrations in wwtp effluents mceff indicated no unacceptable risk for any of the individual chemicals while mceff pnec summation indicated a possible risk for multi component mixtures however a refined mixture assessment based on the sum of toxic units at species level indicated no unacceptable risks and allowed for a safety margin of more than factor 10 not taking into account any dilution of wwtp effluents by surface waters individual substances namely climbazole fenofibric acid and fluoxetine were dominating the risks of the investigated mixtures while added risk due to the mixture was found to be low with the risk quotient being increased by less than factor 2 yet uncertainty remains regarding chronic mixture toxicity in fish which was not included in the present study the number and identity of substances composing environmental mixtures such as wwtp effluents is typically unknown therefore a mixture assessment factor is discussed as an option for a prospective era of mixtures of unknown composition graphical abstract image 1 keywords chronic aquatic toxicity fungicides pharmaceuticals flame retardant corrosion inhibitor mixture risk assessment 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps represent systems where chemicals from various sources merge and after their degradation and transformation are released as mixture into the environment for the aquatic environment effluents of wwtps thereby represent a key point source for unintentional and coincidental mixtures of chemicals the environmental risk assessment era for chemicals has traditionally been conducted on a single substance basis within different regulatory frameworks e g human pharmaceuticals pesticides biocides and chemicals regulated under reach such a single substance era is extending towards an era of intentional mixtures in some of these frameworks jrc 2014 yet there is currently no regulation addressing a prospective era of coincidental mixtures of micro pollutants as represented by wwtp effluents kienzler et al 2016 the summation of risk quotients such as the ratios of predicted environmental concentration and predicted no effect concentration pec pnec ratios provides a simple and pragmatic approach for a prospective mixture risk assessment and has been proposed for different regulatory frameworks e g echa 2014 frische et al 2014 jrc 2014 backhaus 2016 this approach is generally more conservative than applying the concept of concentration addition ca separately for identical endpoints or species as explained in detail by backhaus and faust 2012 hence applying ca based on the sum of toxic units stu calculated separately for identical endpoints or at least trophic levels could represent a refinement step if unacceptable risk could not be excluded by pec pnec summation jrc 2014 a few studies applied this tiered approach already to wwtp effluents or surface water samples using predicted escher et al 2011 or measured substance concentrations backhaus and karlsson 2014 thomaidi et al 2015 as exposure estimates these and other studies addressing mixture toxicity in the aquatic environment e g santos et al 2013 ginebreda et al 2014 relied on acute toxicity endpoints due to unavailability of chronic endpoints for many of the individual mixture components yet the regulatory era of human pharmaceuticals as one key group of biologically active micro pollutants in wastewater is required to be based on chronic toxicity data ema 2006 the most sensitive species and the resulting pnec can differ considerably when acute instead of chronic endpoints are used this is illustrated by the dataset for human pharmaceuticals from vestel et al 2016 where in 32 out of 60 cases the chronic and the acute pnec for the same substance were derived from species of different trophic levels so far there is some though still limited evidence that ca provides reasonably good estimates not only for acute but also for chronic effects in aquatic organisms hermens et al 1984 coors et al 2014 hassold and backhaus 2014 watanabe et al 2016 the present study therefore focussed on chronic aquatic toxicity also in view of the almost constant discharge from wwtps the aim of the present study was to experimentally investigate the applicability of ca for a predictive era of mixtures of micro pollutants in wwtp effluents and to compare single substance and mixture era based on currently proposed approaches for this purpose mixtures of up to ten substances known or expected to occur in wwtp effluents were tested for aquatic chronic toxicity in two primary producers and one invertebrate additionally the influence of wwtp effluent on the predictability of mixture toxicity was investigated measured concentrations in wwtp effluents mceff served as exposure estimate in the single substance and mixture assessments 2 material methods 2 1 selection of substances and mixtures the rationale for the selection of the individual components in the investigated mixtures was dominated by exposure considerations an extensive review of literature studies published between 2002 and 2012 produced a list of more than 500 chemicals reported to frequently occur in the effluents of municipal wwtps and surface waters in europe eight substances were selected among these for the present study the fungicidal human pharmaceutical fluconazole the anti depressant fluoxetine the beta blocker metoprolol the fungicide climbazole regulated under reach and contained e g in anti dandruff shampoo the flame retardant tris 2 chloropropyl phosphate tcpp the corrosion inhibitor 5 methylbenzotriazole 5 mbt the fungicidal preservative methylparaben used in personal care products and the fungicide propiconazole authorized as biocide and plant protection product in the european union eu three more human pharmaceuticals were selected for which no or few published data on occurrence in european municipal wwtp effluents were available but consumption data indicated potential presence in the environment these were the calcium channel blocker amlodipine the lipid modifying agent fenofibric acid an active pharmaceutical ingredient api on its own as well as the active metabolite of fenofibrate and the antibiotic linezolid in addition to the occurrence in wwtp effluents the dis similarity of the intended mode of action moa of the compounds was considered during the selection process in order to challenge ca based mixture predictions compounds were preferably selected which are known inhibitors of the detoxifying cytochrome p450 system because this may increase the likelihood of synergistic interactions in the mixture cedergreen 2014 the assumed or known sensitivity of the pre selected test species primary producers and one aquatic invertebrate were additionally taken into account for selecting the compounds and composing the individual test mixtures aiming to include the most relevant chemicals in a mixture test with a given species since testing mixtures in fish was beyond the scope of the present study no substances were selected for which fish can be assumed to be particularly sensitive e g estrogens or suspected endocrine disruptors in addition to the individual selected substances the following conceptionally different mixtures were experimentally tested in the present study a three components with similar moa mixture of the three azoles fluconazole propiconazole and climbazole to represent mixtures of components with a similar intended moa inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis by binding to c 14 demethylase that are regulated in different regulatory frameworks this mixture was tested at an equipotent concentration ratio of the components in green algae and the aquatic invertebrate d magna and as only mixture also in the water lentil l minor because of its known high sensitivity for azoles richter et al 2013 b three components with dissimilar moa mixture of climbazole amlodipine and metoprolol to represent mixtures of components with a dissimilar intended moa this mixture was tested only in green algae at an equipotent concentration ratio c multiple components 9 10 at an equipotent concentration ratio mixture of the three azoles climbazole fluconazole and propiconazole three chemicals regulated under reach tcpp 5 mbt and methylparaben and two more pharmaceuticals fluoxetine and metoprolol when tested in green algae it contained additionally amlodipine and the antibiotic linezolid 10 components in total but fenofibric acid when tested in d magna 9 components in total this difference in mixture composition reflects the differences in sensitivity of the two species towards these three substances d multiple components 9 10 at an exposure related concentration ratio mixture of the same components and tested in the same species as in c with the difference that the relative proportions of the components were based on their median concentrations in wwtp effluents as evidenced by the literature review in order to evaluate whether the wwtp effluent matrix and the plethora of substances therein would interfere with the mixture toxicity predictions as proposed e g by frische et al 2009 several of the above listed mixture compositions a b and c were tested in parallel with and without municipal wwtp effluent mixed into the medium 2 2 exposure estimates determination of mceff values since production volumes of chemicals regulated under reach are confidential predicted environmental concentrations pecs were not available for several substances of the present study therefore measured concentrations in municipal wwtp effluents mceff were compiled and used in the era no factor accounting for dilution by surface waters was applied the data compiled from literature studies were complemented by repeated measurements of the effluent of a municipal wwtp which was also used in some mixture experiments details on the investigated wwtp and the analytical results are provided in the supplements from all compiled data median and 90 percentiles were derived as descriptors of the statistical distribution of the concentrations of each chemical non detects were treated as zero values in the statistical evaluation 2 3 test substances test substances were purchased from dr ehrenstorfer sigma aldrich tokyo chemical industry or toronto research chemicals at a purity of 95 for some pharmaceuticals salts were used as test item in the tests see details in supplements yet all concentrations and toxicity estimates relate to the active moiety of the api i e the free base or acid and not to the salt single substance and mixture tests were conducted within a period of 2 years during which regular tests with reference substances demonstrated unaltered sensitivity of the used test organisms in all tests the substances were directly dissolved in the test medium without using dispersants or solvents 2 4 growth inhibition tests with the water plant lemna minor growth inhibition tests with l minor were performed according to oecd guideline 221 in a geometric dilution series with a spacing factor not exceeding 3 2 six concentrations three replicates each were tested along with a control six replicates the erc10 concentration with 10 effect on growth rate based on frond numbers and determined after 7 days of static exposure was used as key endpoint temperature was between 22 c and 25 4 c and ph ranged from 5 7 to 7 7 in the absence and from 8 5 to 9 4 in the presence of wwtp effluent the ph value changed only in one individual test with mixture a with 1 8 units slightly more than the limit of 1 5 units allowed by the guideline as these deviations are only minor they are not deemed to invalidate the test results all tests in the present study fulfilled the validity criteria of the oecd 221 guideline with regard to the doubling time of frond number in the control less than 2 5 days corresponding to an about 7 fold increase of frond number in seven days and a growth rate of 0 275 per day 2 5 growth inhibition tests with the green algae raphidocelis subcapitata in all tests r subcapitata formerly known as pseudokirchneriella subcapitata or selenastrum capricornutum was statically exposed for a test period of 72 h according to oecd guideline 201 erc10 was selected as key endpoint concentration response tests were conducted with seven concentration levels three replicates each separated by a spacing factor of 3 2 or less and a control six replicates each replicate vessel 100 ml test solution was inoculated with 0 5 104 cells ml taken from an exponentially growing pre culture vessels were continuously shaken during the exposure under permanent light at an intensity of 60 120 μe m 2 s 1 as confirmed by measurements across all tests temperature ranged between 20 2 and 24 c and ph between 7 3 and 10 2 due to strong growth the change of the ph during the exposure period occasionally exceeded in the controls and at low test concentrations the maximum of 1 5 ph units allowed by the guideline maximum change of 2 4 units since no impact on growth was observed these slight deviations from the prescribed ph range are not deemed to have any impact on the reliability of the results all tests of the present study fulfilled the validity criteria of the oecd 201 guideline with regard to the mean biomass increase at least 16 fold induction and the coefficient of variation of growth rate in the controls equal or less than 7 2 6 reproduction tests with the freshwater crustacean daphnia magna d magna reproduction tests were conducted according to oecd guideline 211 as semi static exposure with eleven replicate vessels for the control and ten replicate vessels for each of the five to seven concentration levels separated by a spacing factor between 1 4 and 3 2 ec10 of reproduction measured as cumulative number of living offspring produced per surviving female within 21 days was selected as key endpoint tests started with one individual d magna 24 h old in each replicate feeding exposure conditions and measurements were in accordance with oecd 211 the temperature range prescribed by the guideline 18 22 c controlled at 1 c was occasionally slightly exceeded minimum of 16 0 c maximum of 24 2 c while oxygen content ph 7 7 8 8 and light intensity were in all tests in the recommended range as confirmed by repeated measurements survival and number of living offspring per female were recorded daily all tests in the present study fulfilled the validity criteria of the oecd guideline 211 i e 20 or less mortality of control females until the end of the test and at least 60 offspring per surviving female in the control this last criterion was achieved in the test with metoprolol only after prolongation of the test period until day 22 2 7 testing mixtures in absence and presence of wwtp effluents all mixtures were tested as geometric dilution series of a stock solution i e at a fixed ratio of the mixture component concentrations in order to test mixtures in parallel in absence and presence of wwtp effluent 24 h composite samples from a municipal wwtp were collected and either used in the tests within 12 h algae or stored refrigerated for up to 5 days d magna l minor each mixture concentration level in the dilution series with wwtp effluent consequently contained 50 effluent in the test solution i e the effluent was not diluted along the mixture dilution series from a twofold concentrated stock solution prepared in twofold concentrated culture medium of the respective test organism one dilution series was prepared using deionized water and culture medium absence of effluent and a second series with identical dilution steps using the wwtp effluent and standard culture medium presence of effluent thereby it was ensured that both dilution series presence and absence of effluent originated from the same stock solution and contained essential elements and nutrients at least at the concentrations prescribed by the guideline there were always two test substance free controls standard culture medium medium control and twofold concentrated standard culture medium diluted 1 1 with effluent effluent control 2 8 analytical measurements of chemicals in all single substance and mixture tests the concentrations of all test substances in the exposure solutions at test start were verified by analytical measurement of the lowest a medium and the highest concentration level in some cases substances were additionally analyzed after 2 3 three days of exposure to confirm constant concentrations during the test analysis of the test substances was done by direct injection into a hplc ms ms system liquid chromatograph 1260 infinity from agilent technologies waldbronn germany coupled via an electrospray interface to an api 5500 tandem mass spectrometer ab sciex langen germany if needed due to low test concentrations solid phase extraction on a polymeric material strata x from phenomenex aschaffenburg germany was used for pre concentration quantification was done against an external calibration in test medium 2 9 data analysis data of concentration dependent growth rate and reproduction were fitted by non linear modelling with the free software r version 3 2 2 r development core team 2013 using the most recent version of the package drc ritz et al 2015 in most cases a 3 parameter log logistic function achieved good fits while in some cases a 5 parameter or 3 parameter weibull model produced better fits effect concentrations with 10 and 50 effect were derived from the fitted models and their 95 confidence intervals were obtained with the implemented function ed of the drc package using the delta method and the t distribution concentration response curves determined in absence and presence of wwtp effluent were compared with each other using the ratio test wheeler et al 2006 for each pair of fitted model parameters if the parameters of two concentration response curves did not significantly differ in the ratio test two sided alpha 0 05 the curves were deemed to not differ significantly lowest observed effect concentrations loec and no observed effect concentrations noec are additionally reported in the supplements toxicity estimates were derived based on nominal concentrations and corrected for measured concentrations if they deviated by more than 20 from nominal test concentrations 2 10 mixture calculations the toxicity of each mixture was predicted for the ec10 according to the ca concept as e c 10 m i x 1 c i c i e c 10 i with ci as concentration of each compound i in the mixture in addition the toxic units tui and the related sum of toxic units stu as a measure for the relative contribution of each component to the overall toxicity were calculated as t u i c i e c 10 i as measure for the compliance between predicted and observed toxicity the model deviation ratio mdr introduced by belden et al 2007 was calculated for each toxicity estimate as m d r p r e d i c t e d e c 10 o b s e r v e d e c 10 an mdr above 1 indicates that the toxicity of the mixture is underestimated by the ca prediction while an mdr below 1 indicates that it is overestimated an mdr between 0 5 and 2 i e indicating a deviation between prediction and observation of up to factor 2 has been interpreted as indicating compliance with ca given the inherent variability of biological test results belden et al 2007 cedergreen et al 2008 coors and frische 2011 cedergreen 2014 mdr values for acute toxicity based on ec50 for algal growth inhibition were calculated additionally and reported in the supplements 2 11 derivation of pnecs and risk quotients based on the results of the present study and literature data pnecs were derived for the 11 substances using an assessment factor af adapted to the data available for species from different trophic levels ecb 2003 risk quotients were calculated as ratio between mceff and pnec for the single substances for the mixtures mceff pnec ratios were summed for a first tier assessment while summed mceff ec10 ratios for individual test organisms served as risk quotients in a second tier assessment 3 results discussion in the following the derived estimates for exposure and effects to be used in a risk assessment are described and discussed first subsequently predictability of chronic mixture toxicity and the differences between a single substance and a mixture risk assessment are addressed 3 1 concentrations of the selected chemicals in wwtp effluents table 1 summarizes the key results from the statistical evaluation of the compiled occurrence data for amlodipine fenofibric acid and linezolid the present study is among the first to report concentrations in a municipal wwtp effluent the antibiotic linezolid was only detected once while amlodipine and fenofibric acid were detected in all four analyzed samples in a concentration above the limit of detection 0 01 μg l concentrations measured in the present study details provided in the supplements were in the range of those reported in literature e g for fenofibric acid and metoprolol ternes et al 2007 rosal et al 2010 as well as for tcpp and fluconazole loos et al 2013 this confirms that the effluent used in the toxicity tests can be regarded as sufficiently representative for municipal wwtp effluents fluoxetine represented an outlier since the concentrations reported by loos et al 2013 for european wwtp effluents were about 10 fold lower than those compiled for mostly north american wwtp effluents due to a lack of published data on fluoxetine concentrations in european wastewaters the concentrations measured in effluent samples of one municipal wwtp in the present study median of 0 024 μg l however did not support a generally 10 fold lower fluoxetine concentration in european compared to north american wwtp effluents methylparaben was not detected in the effluents measured in the present study which agrees with the frequent non detects reported in the literature 3 2 confirmation of actual test concentrations and mixture compositions in the biotests chemical analysis detailed results in the supplement of test solutions at test start confirmed less than 20 deviation from nominal concentrations in all single substance tests of the present study except for propiconazole and metoprolol tested in l minor in the mixture tests concentrations of some components deviated occasionally slightly more than 20 from the nominal concentrations in all these cases observed and predicted toxicity estimates were accordingly corrected and relate to measured initial concentrations constant concentrations under test conditions were checked in one multi component test with algae and all three multi component tests with d magna the results indicated that fluconazole climbazole propiconazole tcpp 5 mbt metoprolol fenofibric acid except in one test and linezolid did not dissipate from the test solutions since at least 80 of initial measured concentration was detected after 2 3 days of exposure this is in agreement with previous findings for fluconazole climbazole richter et al 2013 2016 and metoprolol dzialowski et al 2006 hence it can be assumed that these substances are generally stable under the exposure conditions and that toxicity estimates can be based on nominal or initial measured concentrations amlodipine and fluoxetine showed some dissipation 35 68 recovery of initial measured concentrations while methylparaben concentrations in aged exposure solutions were consistently below the limit of detection however the dissipation of these substances during the exposure did not impact the mixture toxicity predictions based on initial measured concentrations because there is no reason to expect that dissipation differed between single substance and mixture tests only the single substance estimate for fluoxetine takes into account concentrations measured at the end of the exposure oakes et al 2010 therefore fluoxetine concentrations in the mixture tests were as well corrected for time weighted average concentrations 3 3 aquatic chronic toxicity of the individual substances and derived pnecs the toxicity estimates of the individual substances that were used in mixture predictions are summarized in table 2 for most substances complete concentration response curves were obtained see supplements and ec10 values with mostly very tight confidence intervals could be derived no effects were detected up to the highest tested concentration of methylparaben and 5 mbt on d magna reproduction and of metoprolol on growth of l minor the ec10 of tcpp for d magna reproduction was slightly extrapolated beyond the lowest tested concentration based on a clear concentration response curve for some substances as indicated in table 2 estimates for the key endpoints were taken from the literature there are no data available regarding long term fish toxicity for tcpp 5 mbt methylparaben amlodipine fenofibric acid and linezolid while the present study provides chronic endpoints for two trophic levels hence an af of 100 was applied to the here determined lowest ec10 of these substances to derive the pnec similarly no long term fish toxicity data are available in the literature for the azoles climbazole and fluconazole while acute toxicity is considerably less for fish than for primary producers chen and ying 2015 the water plant l minor clearly represented the most sensitive endpoint for both fluconazole and climbazole since chronic toxicity data are available for two trophic levels among them the presumably most sensitive one an af of 50 was used for deriving these pnecs for propiconazole none of the ec10 values derived in the present study was lower than the noec listed for fish in the most recent regulatory assessment of propiconazole as biocide sc 2015 the pnec was accordingly derived from this noec using an af of 10 because chronic data are available for three trophic levels for metoprolol moermond and smit 2016 recently proposed an environmental quality standard eqs of 62 μg l relying on a 9 day toxicity test in daphnia as most sensitive endpoint with an af of 50 as this daphnia test was classified as semi chronic only the ec10 for daphnia reproduction determined in the present study is lower than chronic toxicity data for other trophic levels moermond and smit 2016 and present study which supports using this guideline conform daphnia ec10 with an af of 10 table 1 similar to metoprolol there are numerous studies available on the chronic aquatic toxicity of fluoxetine justifying an af of 10 applied to the estimate for algal toxicity as most sensitive endpoint oakes et al 2010 overall the pnecs for the individual substances ranged from 0 1 μg l to 610 μg l 3 4 predictability of mixture toxicity for chronic endpoints in absence and presence of wwtp effluent the equipotent three component mixtures caused clear concentration dependent responses of the key endpoints fig 1 a d there was no significant difference between the parameters of the models fitted to responses observed in absence and presence of wwtp effluent all p 0 05 only tested with primary producers there was also no adverse effect of the diluted wwtp effluent on primary producers as demonstrated by the controls note that the background concentrations in the wwtp effluent table s2 were not included in the mixture predictions since they were well below the test concentrations most concentration response curves for the three component mixtures did not differ much from the respective curves predicted by ca dotted lines in fig 1 the mdr values determined as quantitative measure of deviation table 3 indicated up to 5 fold overestimation of mixture toxicity with the greatest deviations being observed in algae and the smallest ones in d magna mixture toxicity was underestimated though by less than a factor of 3 for one mixture tested in algae it is remarkable that the only case of mixture toxicity underestimation by ca occurred for the mixture of components with dissimilar moa fig 1d for which according to theory altenburger et al 2004 the ia model would be more appropriate while the ca model should rather overestimate mixture toxicity this indicates that the slight deviation between prediction and observation was not related to the choice of the mixture model possible reasons are rather inherent variability of biological responses and the relatively poor model fit at the low effect level which could not be further improved beyond the finally applied 4 parameter weibull model correction for initial measured concentrations of the mixture components resulted mostly in mdr values closer to 1 i e better compliance between predicted and observed toxicity of the three component mixtures the tests with the multi component mixtures in green algae and daphnia achieved also clear concentration response curves fig 2 a d the toxicity of these mixtures was in no case underestimated and less than 3 fold overestimated by the ca prediction fig 2 table 3 as with the 3 component mixtures the compliance between predicted and observed toxicity slightly increased when measured test concentrations were used data not shown in accordance with the 3 component mixture tests no influence of the wwtp effluent on the concentration response curve was observed for r subcapitata for d magna however only two of the three parameters did not differ significantly curve steepness and ec50 while the upper limit as third parameter differed significantly p 0 001 hence at control or low exposure conditions the reproduction of d magna was significantly enhanced by the presence of 50 wwtp effluent in the test solution this finding is in agreement with previous studies and most likely relates to improved food conditions for the filter feeder d magna due to the bacterial loading of the effluent as discussed elsewhere schlüter vorberg et al 2017 mdr values calculated for acute toxicity of all tested mixtures i e based on ec50 values table s8 in supplements indicated good compliance with ca predictions less than 3 fold deviation the present study hence demonstrates that the aquatic toxicity of mixtures can not only be predicted for acute endpoints as it has been repeatedly shown see e g reviews by cedergreen 2014 and backhaus 2016 but also for sub chronic endpoints in various species the deviation between the predicted and observed chronic mixture toxicity appears to be in the range of that reported for acute endpoints where the majority of cases deviated less than two fold belden et al 2007 coors and frische 2011 a recent study of watanabe et al 2016 investigated the toxicity of 10 wastewater born substances in green algae ceriodaphnia dubia and fish embryos and also concluded that low effect level sub chronic endpoints can be sufficiently well predicted by ca toxicity was equally predictable by ca for mixtures with similar as well as dissimilar intended moa in the present study while this may be simply due to the fact that the predictions of these two models often do not greatly differ junghans et al 2006 it may also indicate that some or all of the substances actually exhibited a similar moa in the tested non target organisms i e non specific baseline toxicity as it has been discussed for micro pollutants in wastewater escher et al 2011 the matrix of wastewater effluent and the multitude of other substances present at low concentrations did not affect the performance of the test organisms nor did it impact the predictability of chronic mixture toxicity in the here conducted tests overall it can therefore be concluded that the ca model can be applied for mixture risk predictions of wwtp effluents with reasonably good reliability this holds at least for key chronic endpoints of primary producers and crustaceans which are required within the era of human pharmaceuticals however this conclusion does not necessarily extend to other species particularly for fish there is still a lack of chronic mixture toxicity studies as supporting evidence for the applicability of ca 3 5 risk quotients for single substances and their mixture the median mceff pnec ratios were below 1 for all single substances i e no unacceptable risk was indicated on a single substance level table 4 when using the more conservative 90 percentile of the mceff the risk quotient was above 1 only in the case of climbazole the sum of the mceff pnec ratios for the mixture of all eleven substances was above 1 when using the median as well as the 90 percentile mceff hence a possible risk was identified for the mixture by the first tier mceff pnec summation approach while a single substance assessment indicated mostly no unacceptable risk for wwtp effluents the species specific risk quotients table 4 which represent the toxic units of the individual substances at the 90 percentile mceff were all below 1 hence all of the substances would exhibit less than 10 effect on any of the species at a concentration equal to a conservative estimate of their municipal wwtp effluent concentration the sum of the single substance risk quotients was still below 1 for all three species which indicates likewise that the mixtures of 7 10 compounds depending on species would induce less than 10 effect the theoretical expectation for no measurable effects was confirmed by the experimental testing of mixtures composed of some of the eleven compounds as no adverse effects occurred at the mceff concentration range diluted wwtp effluent samples used as controls also exhibited no adverse effects on any of the tested species in terms of a risk assessment extrapolation to wwtp effluents in general can be assumed covered by using the conservative 90 percentile mceff value as exposure estimate regarding extrapolation to other species however an assessment factor should be applied the summed species specific risk quotients table 4 allowed for a safety margin i e potential size of an af of 1000 d magna or about 12 green algae before a 10 inhibition would be expected which is greater than the appropriate af in case of a complete dataset the here calculated risk quotients for single substances as well as mixtures do not include a factor accounting for dilution of wwtp effluent in receiving surface waters hence regardless of the question whether the current standard dilution factor of 10 is appropriate link et al 2017 risks for the aquatic environment resulting from combined effects of the considered compounds were already low without assuming dilution by surface water the mixture risk was driven by only few substances fluoxetine in the case of green algae fenofibric acid in the case of d magna and climbazole in the case of l minor this finding is in line with other publications that reported mixture risks to be dominated by few of the mixture s components e g price et al 2012 backhaus and karlsson 2014 gustavsson et al 2017 the maximum cumulative ratio mcr introduced by price and han 2011 relates the risk quotient of the most risky single substance to that of the mixture in order to quantify the added risks due to combined effects in the present study the mcr values ranged from 1 01 to 1 48 i e less than twofold increase due to combined effects which indicates low concern for mixture risks however the selection of compounds their identity number and concentration is crucially determining the outcome of any mixture assessment based on current knowledge deriving a representative or a priority mixture of micro pollutants in wwtp effluents appears an impossible task it would require reliable effluent concentration data for all chemicals possibly occurring in wastewater of which many may not have been subject of wwtp effluent monitoring programs yet this is illustrated by fenofibric acid which has so far not been prioritized for environmental risks in any study but has been ranked third based on individual risk quotients in the present study more so far unknown micro pollutants may occur in wwtp effluents at relevant concentrations one possibility to cover the additional risk of unknown components in a non defined mixture would be a mixture assessment factor maf as discussed earlier e g backhaus 2016 the maf would be applied in every single substance assessment as an additional assessment factor to account for mixture uncertainty apart from lacking justification to blame each substance in the same way for potential additional mixture risk independently of its actual or potential contribution the problem arises to establish an appropriate size of such a maf the so far available scarce evidence from mixture risk assessment studies indicates an at maximum 5 fold greater risk of environmental mixtures compared to their most risky single component price et al 2012 backhaus and karlsson 2014 carvalho et al 2014 this would support an maf of up to 5 or lower i e up to 2 when based on the chronic aquatic mixture toxicity evaluated in the present study 4 conclusions the present study provides ample evidence that the chronic aquatic toxicity of mixtures of diverse substances can be predicted by ca with less than 3 fold underestimation at least with regard to primary producers and invertebrates acknowledging that uncertainty remains regarding the predictability of chronic mixture toxicity in fish reliable prospective eras for mixtures of chemicals present in wwtp effluents could be conducted based on ca yet mixture toxicity concepts such as ca can only address mixtures that are clearly defined in terms of components and their concentrations hence the identification of all possibly relevant chemicals and their concentrations is warranted for a prospective quantitative era of wwtp effluents as mixtures this is hardly possible in view of the currently available data and may not be feasible in the future either given the great number of chemicals possibly occurring in wwtp effluents as substitute applying a mixture assessment factor to all single substance eras could account for combined effects from simultaneous exposures without the need to define all components the actual environmental mixtures however it must be acknowledged that the present study considering up to 11 components in a mixture and applying worst case assumptions did not indicate substantial i e less than two fold additional risk due to the mixture beyond that already posed by some of the individual mixture components acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the german

19528,the self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor sfdmbr is a biological wastewater treatment technology based on the conventional membrane bioreactor mbr with membrane material modification to a large pore size 30 100 μm this modification requires a dynamic layer formed by activated sludge to provide effective filtration function for high quality permeate production the properties of the dynamic layer are therefore important for permeate quality in sfdmbrs the interaction between the structure of the dynamic layer and the performance of sfdmbrs is little known but understandably complex to elucidate the interaction a lab scale sfdmbr system coupled with a nylon woven mesh as the supporting material was operated after development of a mature dynamic layer excellent solid liquid separation was achieved as evidenced by a low permeate turbidity of less than 2 ntu the permeate turbidity stayed below this level for nearly 80 days in the fouling phase the dynamic layer was compressed with an increase in the trans membrane pressure and the quality of the permeate kept deteriorating until the turbidity exceeded 10 ntu the investigation revealed that the majority of permeate particles were dissociated from the dynamic layer on the back surface of the supporting material which is caused by the compression breakdown and dissociation of the dynamic layer this phenomenon was observed directly in experiment instead of model prediction or conjecture for the first time graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane bioreactor self forming dynamic membrane permeate deterioration dynamic layer compression 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs using micro filtration mf and ultra filtration uf membranes have been developed and applied in recent decades judd 2008 the advantages of these conventional mbrs such as excellent effluent quality small footprint and high treatment capacity make them an attractive technology judd and judd 2006 however the capital investment operating and maintenance cost and energy consumption of mbrs remain higher than conventional treatment technologies owing to their low permeate flux the need for frequent chemical cleaning of the membrane and excessive energy demand for coarse bubble aeration le clech et al 2006 these demerits of conventional mbrs are due to the membrane fouling caused by the formation of a biological layer and its metabolites accumulated on the membrane surface meng et al 2017 leveraging extensive studies on the biological dynamic layer lee et al 2001 a new category of mbrs namely self forming dynamic membrane bioreactors sfdmbrs emerged in the 1990s these mbrs utilize the biological layer formed on the membrane surface as an effective filtration layer to lessen the defects of conventional mbrs fan and huang 2002 fuchs et al 2005 instead of mf and uf membranes sfdmbrs use easily accessible low cost materials with a large pore size of 30 100 μm such as woven fabric meshes fuchs et al 2005 kiso et al 2000 stainless steel meshes chu et al 2014 park et al 2018 and non woven fabrics seo et al 2007 as the membrane to reduce the cost of membrane modules while significantly increasing permeate flux kiso et al 2000 wang et al 2017 minimize the need for membrane chemical cleaning guan et al 2014 and lessen the coarse pore bubble requirement kiso et al 2000 however the permeate quality of sfdmbrs is not comparable to that of conventional mbrs especially in the first decade of technology development because the pore size of the membrane is similar to the floc size of activated sludge which allows the sludge flocs easily pass through the membrane kiso et al 2000 in recent years based on the understanding of the biological dynamic layer formed on the membrane from activated sludge hereafter referred to as the dynamic layer ersahin et al 2012 many studies have demonstrated that sfdmbrs are able to produce a higher permeate quality e g turbidity 5 ntu chu et al 2014 loderer et al 2012 all of these studies have demonstrated that a well formed mature dynamic layer is necessary since it acts as an effective filtration layer in sfdmbrs while the membrane only provides support for the development of the dynamic layer chu et al 2014 fan and huang 2002 this is the reason that the membrane applied in sfdmbrs is called the supporting material even though the mature dynamic layer is well formed the unstable permeate quality of sfdmbrs remains a challenging issue especially in the fouling phase after long term operation poostchi et al 2015 salerno et al 2017 thus hindering the scale up of this technology one major obstacle is the lack of understanding of the relationship between the quality of the permeate and the structure of the dynamic layer the structure of the dynamic layer including its physical chemical and biological properties is affected by operating conditions wang et al 2015 as well as the properties of activated sludge liang et al 2013 the chemical liu et al 2015 and biological properties wang et al 2012 of the dynamic layer have recently been widely investigated under various operating conditions however few studies have examined the physical properties of the dynamic layer and its correlation with permeate quality liang et al suspected that the compactness of the dynamic layer varies with transmembrane pressure tmp permeate flux and operation mode and may play an important role in the performance of sfdmbrs based on resistance calculation 2012 but the exact physical structure of the dynamic layer and its relationship with permeate quality is still unclear a lab scale sfdmbr system was thus operated to evaluate the relationship between the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and the permeate quality when the properties of activated sludge are stable the properties of dynamic layer before and after peeling off from the supporting material were compared with the morphology and chemical properties of particles in the permeate to further confirm the correlation between the dynamic layer and permeate particles batch tests using supporting materials with different pore sizes were also conducted with cross flow filtration cells based on the results the connection between the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and permeate quality in sfdmbrs is established for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 long term operation 2 1 1 sfdmbr module the supporting material used in the sfdmbr system was woven mesh in 3 3 twill weave it is also called the supporting mesh in this study the supporting mesh is made of nylon 6 image 2 fibers it is a hydrophobic material with 90 9 contact angle the average pore size of the supporting mesh was determined to be 20 71 4 60 μm from scanning electron microscope sem images fig s1 in supplementary information si coupled with imagej calculation each sfdmbr module consisted of two sheets of supporting mesh fixed to a flat sheet aluminum plastic frame the total effective filtration area of the module was 0 016 m2 2 1 2 experimental setup and operating conditions a lab scale anoxic aerobic activated sludge system as shown in fig 1 was adopted for all experiments three identical sfdmbr modules were installed in the aerobic tank each module was equipped with two sets of aeration tubes underneath to provide an equal shear force across the surface of the module as well as sufficient dissolved oxygen do varying around 3 5 mg l the total aeration intensity was 0 0059 m3m 2s 1 which was a relatively low level in most of sfdmbr studies chang et al 2006 2007 the anoxic tank was equipped with a mixer for thorough mixing the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration in the sfdmbr system was varied from 4000 to 6000 mg l and centered at approximately 5000 mg l level by regular sludge discharge during operation the solid retention time srt of the sfdmbr system was 13 7 days other detailed operating parameters at steady state are shown in table s1 in si synthetic wastewater table s2 in si was drawn from an influent tank and fed to the anoxic tank directly the food to microorganism ratio f m was maintained around 0 24 mg chemical oxygen demand cod mg mlss d to maintain the stable properties of the activated sludge in the sfdmbr system the effluent was continuously drawn from each sfdmbr module using a peristaltic pump with a stable flow rate two modules modules 1 and 2 were operated at a constant permeate flux of 1 m3 m2 day 41 67 l m2 h and the flux of the third module module 3 was 2 m3 m2 day 83 33 l m2 h the fluxes were chosen based on the previous studies loderer et al 2012 wang et al 2012 and preliminary tests conducted with the concentrated seeding sludge to a mlss concentration of 7000 mg l offline backwash was performed with tap water for two minutes every 12 h for modules 1 and 3 and every 24 h for module 2 during the backwash the outlet of the membrane module was connected to a water faucet through a hose coupled with a flow rate meter the backwash flow rate was controlled at around 2 l min and the pressure was determined by the water supply system around 4 5 bar which resulted in a backwashing flux of 180 m3 m2 day i e 7500 l m2 h the operating period starting from the end of one backwash to the end of the next backwash was defined as one operating cycle after day 72 three modules were operated with a longer operating cycle which was called the extended filtration period during this period module 2 was continuously run without backwash to investigate for how long a membrane module can be operated under 1 m3 m2 day of flux without permeate deterioration for modules 1 and 3 when tmp reached 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 bar for the first time the dynamic layer sampling followed by backwashing was conducted 2 1 3 sampling methods twelve hour composite samples of the influent and effluent and grab sludge samples from the aerobic tank were collected every 7 days to monitor the system performance through measuring the mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss ammonium nitrogen nh4 total nitrogen tn cod and permeate turbidity tmps of the three modules were continuously recorded considering our previous successful experiences in pilot scale sfdmbr system operation for real wastewater treatment guan et al 2014 system performance was only demonstrated in si fig s2 the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and permeate particles were investigated with samples taken under 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 bars of tmp a permeate sample was collected once the tmp had stabilized at each of the above sampling points the size distribution of permeate particles was analyzed immediately after sampling the permeate particles in the samples were also collected on a 1 2 μm glass fiber filter papers by filtration the filter papers with permeate particles on it were cut into 2 5 mm pieces for morphology analysis after permeate sampling pieces of dynamic layer samples bio cake formed by activated sludge on the supporting mesh were gently peeled off from the modules before backwash using a pair of stainless steel tweezers chu et al 2014 the pieces were evenly selected from the bottom middle and top zones of both sides of the modules the parts with morphology changing were removed with a scalpel after dynamic layer sampling the modules were backwashed and put back to the reactor for further operation at day 87 the dynamic layer was also peeled off and collected for the measurement of physical and chemical properties in addition several pieces samples of supporting mesh with the dynamic layer on it were taken before backwash samples were cut using scalpel carefully to ensure that the morphology of dynamic layer and supporting mesh were not changed during sampling the samples of supporting mesh with the dynamic layer on it were approximate 2 5 mm taken at different locations of the module after sampling the module could not be used without reassembling the module with new supporting material the dynamic layer permeate particles and the mesh sheets containing dynamic layer samples were immediately treated after sampling according to the requirements of different analyses 2 2 batch tests 2 2 1 experimental system after 87 days of long term operation four cross flow filtration cells were connected to the lab scale reactor to test the properties of permeate particles using supporting materials of different pore sizes including 13 20 23 and 35 μm as shown in fig 1 the sludge of the lab scale reactor was recycled through cross flow filtration cells with cross flow velocity of 0 5 m s the effluent filtration area of each cross flow filtration cell was 0 005 m2 permeates were drawn in a constant flux of 2 m3 m2 day 2 2 2 sampling methods permeate sample was taken from the cross flow filtration cells for analysis of particle properties when tmp rose to 0 20 bars the particle size distributions of the permeate samples were immediately analyzed after sampling the particles in the rest part of the sample were collected on a 1 2 μm glass fiber filter paper for morphological and chemical properties analysis the above experiments were repeated twice for each pore size of the supporting mesh 2 3 pre treatment and analytical methods tmp was measured using an electronic pressure

built in brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh equations and calculation sa 3100 beckman coulter usa for morphological analysis pre treated samples were pasted on a copper stage and coated with gold then examined under an sem jsm 6300f jeol japan soluble microbial products smps were separated using centrifugation and filtration extracellular polymeric substances epss were extracted from dynamic layer samples using the formaldehyde naoh method liu and fang 2002 after smp separation the polysaccharide concentration in epss and smps samples was measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 while the protein concentration was measured using a protein assay dc protein assay bio rad laboratories usa meanwhile the volatile solid concentration of each parallel dynamic layer sample was measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 for normalization samples of the dynamic layer the supporting mesh with the dynamic layer on it and permeate particles destined for eps distribution analysis were treated with concanavalin a con a calcofluor white fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and syto 63 immediately after sampling to visualize α polysaccharides β polysaccharides proteins and total cells respectively chen et al 2007 after 15 min of incubation in the dark samples were washed with 1 phosphate buffer saline thoroughly and examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm lsm 710 zeiss germany for all the physical and chemical properties investigation the observations or analyses were at least triply conducted with six parallel samples obtained from different location of modules or supporting materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 sfdmbr performance according to results from modules 1 and 2 operated with the same flux but different backwashing intervals the backwash frequency did not significantly affect the system performance and so the change in permeate turbidity and tmp of modules 1 and 3 operated at different levels of flux are shown instead in fig 2 for comparison the effluent turbidity dropped from more than 10 to less than 2 ntu in the initial 3 days when flux was 2 m3 m2 day and in the initial 7 days when flux was 1 m3 m2 day these results indicate that a start up phase of several days was required to stabilize the dynamic layer on the surface of the supporting mesh and a higher filtration flux could shorten this start up phase from days 7 72 the modules were operated in a stable operation phase with regular backwash during which the effluent turbidity remained at approximately 1 ntu while the tmp was less than 0 20 bars the average concentrations of effluent cod ammonia and tn were as low as 27 0 12 7 0 14 0 12 and 2 99 1 63 mg l respectively with a removal efficiency of more than 90 it is remarkable that the tmp in module 3 during the stable operation fluctuated between 0 and 0 2 bar which was highly correlated with the permeate turbidity variation especially after 40 days of operation when the tmp was approaching 0 2 bar the permeate quality could be very good soon after the tmp dropped back to a low level the permeate turbidity was suddenly increased therefore the tmp control during operation may important for the sfdmbr system producing stable permeate quality to investigate the impact of tmp on permeate quality extended filtration with a low backwash frequency was performed after day 72 to allow the build up of tmp the permeate turbidity decreased to the minimum value 0 14 and 0 24 ntu soon after extended filtration began and then steadily increased to 5 ntu in the subsequent 7 and 12 days with operating flux levels of 2 and 1 and m3 m2 day respectively as tmp increased from 0 4 to 0 8 bars the permeate turbidity gradually increased too the deterioration of effluent quality and a high tmp at the end of the extended filtration period were clearly observed the same phenomenon was also reported by other researchers who speculated that a high tmp in the fouling phase may lead to a large local flux destroy the dynamic layer push the sludge through the supporting mesh and cause a high effluent turbidity loderer et al 2012 in order to verify the above conjecture the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and the morphology of the permeate particles were further analyzed 3 2 dynamic layer fig 3 a shows the pore size distribution of the dynamic layer at four different tmp values despite the large pore size of the supporting mesh the pore sizes of the dynamic layers were mainly below 100 nm which can filter out nearly all the particles in the bulk liquid to produce a high quality permeate the pore size of four dynamic layers mainly lay within two regions from 3 65 to 5 79 nm and from 24 8 to 71 40 nm at a pore size larger than 20 nm the pore volume percentage increased as the tmp decreased at a pore size smaller than 7 nm the pore volume percentage decreased as the tmp increased these results indicate that a higher tmp would result in smaller pores in the dynamic layer longmuir specific surface area total pore volume and wet density of the dynamic layer are shown in fig 3b at a tmp of 0 2 bars the specific surface area of the dynamic layer was 2 6750 m2 g the value decreased to 1 7610 1 5710 and 0 5950 m2 g when tmp increased to 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively the total pore volume of the dynamic layer fell from 0 0119 to 0 0047 ml g when the tmp rose from 0 2 to 0 8 bars which is consistent with the increase in wet density with growing tmp the adsorption and desorption isotherm shown in fig s3 in si indicated that the dynamic layer changed from mesoporous material into nonporous material when the tmp rose from 0 2 to 0 8 bars the results of the physical properties of dynamic layer samples agree with the sem images of the dynamic layers shown in fig s4 in si comparing to the suspended activated sludge the epss concentrations of the dynamic layer were slightly higher while the smps concentrations were lower that could be explained by the solubility difference between epss and smps smps can easily penetrate the dynamic layer and be washed out with permeate however unlike the physical properties the epss and smps concentrations of the dynamic layer and the activated sludge in bulk liquid remained within a relatively stable range while the tmp increased from 0 2 bars to 0 8 bars fig 3c indicating that epss and smps did not accumulate significantly on the dynamic layer at a high tmp this shows that the compactness of the dynamic layer was due to its compression instead of epss and smps accumulation in summary the physical properties of dynamic layer samples at different tmps clearly demonstrate that inverse proportional relationships exist among tmp and pore size distribution surface area total pore volume and wet density these results indicate that the dynamic layer would be compressed as the tmp increases the compacted dynamic layer with a lower pore volume and smaller pore size could block more particles in the bulk liquid under a higher tmp this explains why this sfdmbr performed better in later cycles of operation with a slightly higher tmp 0 4 bars instead of 0 2 bars fig 2 however when the tmp reached 0 8 bars the effluent quality dropped dramatically despite the high compactness of the dynamic layer which cannot be explained by the physical properties of the dynamic layer therefore the relationship between the dynamic layer and the supporting mesh was further investigated after fouling 3 3 relationship between the dynamic layer and the supporting mesh the sem images of the back surface of the supporting mesh with the dynamic layer on it reveal that the dynamic layer had been pushed into the pores of the mesh fig 4 after being compressed and pushed into the pores the dynamic layer started to break down along the fibers of the supporting mesh fig 4a and b numerous straight cracks appeared in the dynamic layer on the back surface of the mesh which might result in protruding parts with smooth edges and similar size with the pores of the supporting mesh a majority protruding parts could be dissociated from the dynamic layer and appeared in the permeate under continuous pressure and local flux a black spot on the dynamic layer at the same confocal plane with supporting mesh could be seen clearly from the clsm images of α polysaccharides fig 5 a proteins fig 5c and bacterial cells fig 5d on the back surface of the supporting mesh see the white circles which could be formed due to the protruding parts dissociation β polysaccharides were tightly attached to the supporting mesh fibers and therefore the black spot formed from the dynamic layer dissociation cannot be seen the shape and size of the black spot matched the protruding part shown in sem images fig 4 hence the properties of particles in the permeate were extensively studied for comparison 3 4 permeate particles the morphology and size of particles in the permeate under different tmps were investigated and are shown in fig 6 in the sem images the permeate particles are approximately 20 μm in length regardless of the operating tmp this length matched the pore size of the mesh 20 71 4 60 μm and the crack protruding part and black spot observed at the back of the supporting mesh figs 4 and 5 moreover the diameter of the particles was stably distributed around 20 μm when the tmp was 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 bars fig 6e under high pressure 0 8 bars the permeate particle size increased slightly due to the high compactness of the dynamic layer which is consistent with the sem image showing a clear cubic shape with a side length of approximately 20 μm in summary the size distribution of the permeate particles and the physical and chemical properties of the mesh confirmed that the majority of suspended solids in the permeate was attributed to particles dissociated from the dynamic layer 3 5 tests with different mesh sizes batch tests with different mesh sizes were also conducted to confirm the relationship between permeate particle properties and mesh size at a lower tmp 0 2 bars fig 7 a shows the particle size distribution of activated sludge and the permeate produced using four different meshes with the pore sizes of 13 20 23 and 35 μm the mean particle size of the activated sludge in the reactor was kept above 75 μm for all four supporting meshes the permeate particles were obviously smaller than the activated sludge flocs indicating that the meshes blocked most of the sludge flocs from the bulk liquid effectively as the mesh pore size decreased the permeate particles became smaller as well fig 7b shows the correlation between the average mesh pore size and the mode size of permeate particles with the intercept set at zero the permeate particle size showed a linear relationship with the mesh pore size r2 0 9318 the linear regression indicated that the permeate particles were 1 13 times larger than the supporting mesh pores because the mesh pore size was calculated based on the side length and the particle size was measured three dimensionally it can be concluded that no matter which supporting mesh was used the permeate particles had the same size as the mesh pores after the mature dynamic layer was formed on the supporting mesh the chemical properties of the permeate particles from different meshes were also observed under a clsm with epss distribution staining to further confirm the source of permeate particles the shape and size of permeate particles shown in the images fig 8 are consistent with the results of particle size distribution fig 7 the permeate particles were a mixture of bacterial cells proteins and polysaccharides which is consistent with the structure of the dynamic layer fig 5 further demonstrating that the permeate particles were came from the dissociation of the dynamic layer even when the tmp was as low as 0 2 bars however the β polysaccharide was distributed differently in the permeate particles than in the dynamic layer in permeate particles the β polysaccharide was only distributed in the center of the particles with a lower fluorescent intensity than the other components fig 8a2 d2 according to observations of the back surface of the supporting mesh β polysaccharide was tightly attached to the supporting material fibers fig 5b these results indicated that β polysaccharide attached more easily to the mesh fiber than did other types of epss β polysaccharide residuals accumulated on the mesh fibers as the dynamic layer gradually dissociated from the supporting mesh especially when the system was operated under high pressure this phenomenon might explain the quick jump in tmp in the fouling phase based on the findings above a mechanism consisting of three steps dynamic layer compression breakdown and dissociation in sfdmbrs is proposed the first step is dynamic layer compression with the increase in tmp and local flux after the formation of the dynamic layer on the supporting material during this step the dynamic layer is continuously compacted from a loosely bound structure to a tightly bound one the compacted dynamic layer with a smaller pore size and pore volume results in a simultaneous increase in tmp therefore the compactness of the dynamic layer and tmp drive each other in this step meanwhile the compacted dynamic layer can act as an effective filtration material that produces the permeate with the highest quality once the dynamic layer is largely compacted the tmp and local flux can be greatly increased to provide suitable conditions for the breakdown stage in the second step the dynamic layer breaks down along the fibers and is forced into the pores of the supporting material protruding parts form on the back surface of the supporting material at the end of this step due to persistent increase of tmp and local flux in the third step known as the dissociation step the protruding parts are further pushed out from the mesh pores and will eventually dissociate from the dynamic layer and enter the permeate these three steps are repeated during sfdmbr operation so the majority of particles in the permeate come from the pieces of the dynamic layer during the fouling phase the significantly increased tmp and local flux accelerate these three steps 4 conclusions in this study an sfdmbr system was stably operated for more than 80 days by investigating the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and permeate particles the relationship between the two in sfdmbrs is revealed after the successful formation of the dynamic layer the particles in the permeate are mainly formed from the dissociation of the dynamic layer on the back surface of the supporting mesh which size is determined by the pore size of supporting mesh the compression breakdown and dissociation of the dynamic layer were observed directly in experiment instead of model prediction or conjecture for the first time the compression breakdown and dissociation of dynamic layer were getting severe at higher tmp so the number of particles in permeate increased with the build up of the tmp a proper tmp range less than 0 6 bars should be maintained for efficient sfdmbr filtration and to prevent severe dynamic layer breakdown and deterioration of permeate quality β polysaccharide can easily accumulate on the mesh fibers as foulant during long term operation and should be prevented which can be further investigated in future studies in summary the change in the physical structure of the dynamic layer in sfdmbrs involving compression breakdown and dissociation proposed in this study can accurately explain permeate deterioration tmp control is very important for the stable operation of sfdmbr with persistent good effluent quality the time based backwash regulation can be supplemented by the tmp based one to benefit a better operation of sfdmbr for stable permeate quality the results provide a novel exploration direction as well as guidelines for applying this technology the mechanism proposed in this study should be further confirmed with more experiments conducted with real wastewater treatment in future and the system performance would be extensively evaluated the relationship between dynamic layer dissociation and β polysaccharide accumulation on the supporting material fibers is worth being investigated acknowledgments this work was supported by the hong kong innovation and technology commission grant numbers itc cnerc14eg03

19528,the self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor sfdmbr is a biological wastewater treatment technology based on the conventional membrane bioreactor mbr with membrane material modification to a large pore size 30 100 μm this modification requires a dynamic layer formed by activated sludge to provide effective filtration function for high quality permeate production the properties of the dynamic layer are therefore important for permeate quality in sfdmbrs the interaction between the structure of the dynamic layer and the performance of sfdmbrs is little known but understandably complex to elucidate the interaction a lab scale sfdmbr system coupled with a nylon woven mesh as the supporting material was operated after development of a mature dynamic layer excellent solid liquid separation was achieved as evidenced by a low permeate turbidity of less than 2 ntu the permeate turbidity stayed below this level for nearly 80 days in the fouling phase the dynamic layer was compressed with an increase in the trans membrane pressure and the quality of the permeate kept deteriorating until the turbidity exceeded 10 ntu the investigation revealed that the majority of permeate particles were dissociated from the dynamic layer on the back surface of the supporting material which is caused by the compression breakdown and dissociation of the dynamic layer this phenomenon was observed directly in experiment instead of model prediction or conjecture for the first time graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane bioreactor self forming dynamic membrane permeate deterioration dynamic layer compression 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs using micro filtration mf and ultra filtration uf membranes have been developed and applied in recent decades judd 2008 the advantages of these conventional mbrs such as excellent effluent quality small footprint and high treatment capacity make them an attractive technology judd and judd 2006 however the capital investment operating and maintenance cost and energy consumption of mbrs remain higher than conventional treatment technologies owing to their low permeate flux the need for frequent chemical cleaning of the membrane and excessive energy demand for coarse bubble aeration le clech et al 2006 these demerits of conventional mbrs are due to the membrane fouling caused by the formation of a biological layer and its metabolites accumulated on the membrane surface meng et al 2017 leveraging extensive studies on the biological dynamic layer lee et al 2001 a new category of mbrs namely self forming dynamic membrane bioreactors sfdmbrs emerged in the 1990s these mbrs utilize the biological layer formed on the membrane surface as an effective filtration layer to lessen the defects of conventional mbrs fan and huang 2002 fuchs et al 2005 instead of mf and uf membranes sfdmbrs use easily accessible low cost materials with a large pore size of 30 100 μm such as woven fabric meshes fuchs et al 2005 kiso et al 2000 stainless steel meshes chu et al 2014 park et al 2018 and non woven fabrics seo et al 2007 as the membrane to reduce the cost of membrane modules while significantly increasing permeate flux kiso et al 2000 wang et al 2017 minimize the need for membrane chemical cleaning guan et al 2014 and lessen the coarse pore bubble requirement kiso et al 2000 however the permeate quality of sfdmbrs is not comparable to that of conventional mbrs especially in the first decade of technology development because the pore size of the membrane is similar to the floc size of activated sludge which allows the sludge flocs easily pass through the membrane kiso et al 2000 in recent years based on the understanding of the biological dynamic layer formed on the membrane from activated sludge hereafter referred to as the dynamic layer ersahin et al 2012 many studies have demonstrated that sfdmbrs are able to produce a higher permeate quality e g turbidity 5 ntu chu et al 2014 loderer et al 2012 all of these studies have demonstrated that a well formed mature dynamic layer is necessary since it acts as an effective filtration layer in sfdmbrs while the membrane only provides support for the development of the dynamic layer chu et al 2014 fan and huang 2002 this is the reason that the membrane applied in sfdmbrs is called the supporting material even though the mature dynamic layer is well formed the unstable permeate quality of sfdmbrs remains a challenging issue especially in the fouling phase after long term operation poostchi et al 2015 salerno et al 2017 thus hindering the scale up of this technology one major obstacle is the lack of understanding of the relationship between the quality of the permeate and the structure of the dynamic layer the structure of the dynamic layer including its physical chemical and biological properties is affected by operating conditions wang et al 2015 as well as the properties of activated sludge liang et al 2013 the chemical liu et al 2015 and biological properties wang et al 2012 of the dynamic layer have recently been widely investigated under various operating conditions however few studies have examined the physical properties of the dynamic layer and its correlation with permeate quality liang et al suspected that the compactness of the dynamic layer varies with transmembrane pressure tmp permeate flux and operation mode and may play an important role in the performance of sfdmbrs based on resistance calculation 2012 but the exact physical structure of the dynamic layer and its relationship with permeate quality is still unclear a lab scale sfdmbr system was thus operated to evaluate the relationship between the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and the permeate quality when the properties of activated sludge are stable the properties of dynamic layer before and after peeling off from the supporting material were compared with the morphology and chemical properties of particles in the permeate to further confirm the correlation between the dynamic layer and permeate particles batch tests using supporting materials with different pore sizes were also conducted with cross flow filtration cells based on the results the connection between the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and permeate quality in sfdmbrs is established for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 long term operation 2 1 1 sfdmbr module the supporting material used in the sfdmbr system was woven mesh in 3 3 twill weave it is also called the supporting mesh in this study the supporting mesh is made of nylon 6 image 2 fibers it is a hydrophobic material with 90 9 contact angle the average pore size of the supporting mesh was determined to be 20 71 4 60 μm from scanning electron microscope sem images fig s1 in supplementary information si coupled with imagej calculation each sfdmbr module consisted of two sheets of supporting mesh fixed to a flat sheet aluminum plastic frame the total effective filtration area of the module was 0 016 m2 2 1 2 experimental setup and operating conditions a lab scale anoxic aerobic activated sludge system as shown in fig 1 was adopted for all experiments three identical sfdmbr modules were installed in the aerobic tank each module was equipped with two sets of aeration tubes underneath to provide an equal shear force across the surface of the module as well as sufficient dissolved oxygen do varying around 3 5 mg l the total aeration intensity was 0 0059 m3m 2s 1 which was a relatively low level in most of sfdmbr studies chang et al 2006 2007 the anoxic tank was equipped with a mixer for thorough mixing the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration in the sfdmbr system was varied from 4000 to 6000 mg l and centered at approximately 5000 mg l level by regular sludge discharge during operation the solid retention time srt of the sfdmbr system was 13 7 days other detailed operating parameters at steady state are shown in table s1 in si synthetic wastewater table s2 in si was drawn from an influent tank and fed to the anoxic tank directly the food to microorganism ratio f m was maintained around 0 24 mg chemical oxygen demand cod mg mlss d to maintain the stable properties of the activated sludge in the sfdmbr system the effluent was continuously drawn from each sfdmbr module using a peristaltic pump with a stable flow rate two modules modules 1 and 2 were operated at a constant permeate flux of 1 m3 m2 day 41 67 l m2 h and the flux of the third module module 3 was 2 m3 m2 day 83 33 l m2 h the fluxes were chosen based on the previous studies loderer et al 2012 wang et al 2012 and preliminary tests conducted with the concentrated seeding sludge to a mlss concentration of 7000 mg l offline backwash was performed with tap water for two minutes every 12 h for modules 1 and 3 and every 24 h for module 2 during the backwash the outlet of the membrane module was connected to a water faucet through a hose coupled with a flow rate meter the backwash flow rate was controlled at around 2 l min and the pressure was determined by the water supply system around 4 5 bar which resulted in a backwashing flux of 180 m3 m2 day i e 7500 l m2 h the operating period starting from the end of one backwash to the end of the next backwash was defined as one operating cycle after day 72 three modules were operated with a longer operating cycle which was called the extended filtration period during this period module 2 was continuously run without backwash to investigate for how long a membrane module can be operated under 1 m3 m2 day of flux without permeate deterioration for modules 1 and 3 when tmp reached 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 bar for the first time the dynamic layer sampling followed by backwashing was conducted 2 1 3 sampling methods twelve hour composite samples of the influent and effluent and grab sludge samples from the aerobic tank were collected every 7 days to monitor the system performance through measuring the mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss ammonium nitrogen nh4 total nitrogen tn cod and permeate turbidity tmps of the three modules were continuously recorded considering our previous successful experiences in pilot scale sfdmbr system operation for real wastewater treatment guan et al 2014 system performance was only demonstrated in si fig s2 the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and permeate particles were investigated with samples taken under 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 bars of tmp a permeate sample was collected once the tmp had stabilized at each of the above sampling points the size distribution of permeate particles was analyzed immediately after sampling the permeate particles in the samples were also collected on a 1 2 μm glass fiber filter papers by filtration the filter papers with permeate particles on it were cut into 2 5 mm pieces for morphology analysis after permeate sampling pieces of dynamic layer samples bio cake formed by activated sludge on the supporting mesh were gently peeled off from the modules before backwash using a pair of stainless steel tweezers chu et al 2014 the pieces were evenly selected from the bottom middle and top zones of both sides of the modules the parts with morphology changing were removed with a scalpel after dynamic layer sampling the modules were backwashed and put back to the reactor for further operation at day 87 the dynamic layer was also peeled off and collected for the measurement of physical and chemical properties in addition several pieces samples of supporting mesh with the dynamic layer on it were taken before backwash samples were cut using scalpel carefully to ensure that the morphology of dynamic layer and supporting mesh were not changed during sampling the samples of supporting mesh with the dynamic layer on it were approximate 2 5 mm taken at different locations of the module after sampling the module could not be used without reassembling the module with new supporting material the dynamic layer permeate particles and the mesh sheets containing dynamic layer samples were immediately treated after sampling according to the requirements of different analyses 2 2 batch tests 2 2 1 experimental system after 87 days of long term operation four cross flow filtration cells were connected to the lab scale reactor to test the properties of permeate particles using supporting materials of different pore sizes including 13 20 23 and 35 μm as shown in fig 1 the sludge of the lab scale reactor was recycled through cross flow filtration cells with cross flow velocity of 0 5 m s the effluent filtration area of each cross flow filtration cell was 0 005 m2 permeates were drawn in a constant flux of 2 m3 m2 day 2 2 2 sampling methods permeate sample was taken from the cross flow filtration cells for analysis of particle properties when tmp rose to 0 20 bars the particle size distributions of the permeate samples were immediately analyzed after sampling the particles in the rest part of the sample were collected on a 1 2 μm glass fiber filter paper for morphological and chemical properties analysis the above experiments were repeated twice for each pore size of the supporting mesh 2 3 pre treatment and analytical methods tmp was measured using an electronic pressure

parallel dynamic layer sample was measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 for normalization samples of the dynamic layer the supporting mesh with the dynamic layer on it and permeate particles destined for eps distribution analysis were treated with concanavalin a con a calcofluor white fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and syto 63 immediately after sampling to visualize α polysaccharides β polysaccharides proteins and total cells respectively chen et al 2007 after 15 min of incubation in the dark samples were washed with 1 phosphate buffer saline thoroughly and examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm lsm 710 zeiss germany for all the physical and chemical properties investigation the observations or analyses were at least triply conducted with six parallel samples obtained from different location of modules or supporting materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 sfdmbr performance according to results from modules 1 and 2 operated with the same flux but different backwashing intervals the backwash frequency did not significantly affect the system performance and so the change in permeate turbidity and tmp of modules 1 and 3 operated at different levels of flux are shown instead in fig 2 for comparison the effluent turbidity dropped from more than 10 to less than 2 ntu in the initial 3 days when flux was 2 m3 m2 day and in the initial 7 days when flux was 1 m3 m2 day these results indicate that a start up phase of several days was required to stabilize the dynamic layer on the surface of the supporting mesh and a higher filtration flux could shorten this start up phase from days 7 72 the modules were operated in a stable operation phase with regular backwash during which the effluent turbidity remained at approximately 1 ntu while the tmp was less than 0 20 bars the average concentrations of effluent cod ammonia and tn were as low as 27 0 12 7 0 14 0 12 and 2 99 1 63 mg l respectively with a removal efficiency of more than 90 it is remarkable that the tmp in module 3 during the stable operation fluctuated between 0 and 0 2 bar which was highly correlated with the permeate turbidity variation especially after 40 days of operation when the tmp was approaching 0 2 bar the permeate quality could be very good soon after the tmp dropped back to a low level the permeate turbidity was suddenly increased therefore the tmp control during operation may important for the sfdmbr system producing stable permeate quality to investigate the impact of tmp on permeate quality extended filtration with a low backwash frequency was performed after day 72 to allow the build up of tmp the permeate turbidity decreased to the minimum value 0 14 and 0 24 ntu soon after extended filtration began and then steadily increased to 5 ntu in the subsequent 7 and 12 days with operating flux levels of 2 and 1 and m3 m2 day respectively as tmp increased from 0 4 to 0 8 bars the permeate turbidity gradually increased too the deterioration of effluent quality and a high tmp at the end of the extended filtration period were clearly observed the same phenomenon was also reported by other researchers who speculated that a high tmp in the fouling phase may lead to a large local flux destroy the dynamic layer push the sludge through the supporting mesh and cause a high effluent turbidity loderer et al 2012 in order to verify the above conjecture the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and the morphology of the permeate particles were further analyzed 3 2 dynamic layer fig 3 a shows the pore size distribution of the dynamic layer at four different tmp values despite the large pore size of the supporting mesh the pore sizes of the dynamic layers were mainly below 100 nm which can filter out nearly all the particles in the bulk liquid to produce a high quality permeate the pore size of four dynamic layers mainly lay within two regions from 3 65 to 5 79 nm and from 24 8 to 71 40 nm at a pore size larger than 20 nm the pore volume percentage increased as the tmp decreased at a pore size smaller than 7 nm the pore volume percentage decreased as the tmp increased these results indicate that a higher tmp would result in smaller pores in the dynamic layer longmuir specific surface area total pore volume and wet density of the dynamic layer are shown in fig 3b at a tmp of 0 2 bars the specific surface area of the dynamic layer was 2 6750 m2 g the value decreased to 1 7610 1 5710 and 0 5950 m2 g when tmp increased to 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively the total pore volume of the dynamic layer fell from 0 0119 to 0 0047 ml g when the tmp rose from 0 2 to 0 8 bars which is consistent with the increase in wet density with growing tmp the adsorption and desorption isotherm shown in fig s3 in si indicated that the dynamic layer changed from mesoporous material into nonporous material when the tmp rose from 0 2 to 0 8 bars the results of the physical properties of dynamic layer samples agree with the sem images of the dynamic layers shown in fig s4 in si comparing to the suspended activated sludge the epss concentrations of the dynamic layer were slightly higher while the smps concentrations were lower that could be explained by the solubility difference between epss and smps smps can easily penetrate the dynamic layer and be washed out with permeate however unlike the physical properties the epss and smps concentrations of the dynamic layer and the activated sludge in bulk liquid remained within a relatively stable range while the tmp increased from 0 2 bars to 0 8 bars fig 3c indicating that epss and smps did not accumulate significantly on the dynamic layer at a high tmp this shows that the compactness of the dynamic layer was due to its compression instead of epss and smps accumulation in summary the physical properties of dynamic layer samples at different tmps clearly demonstrate that inverse proportional relationships exist among tmp and pore size distribution surface area total pore volume and wet density these results indicate that the dynamic layer would be compressed as the tmp increases the compacted dynamic layer with a lower pore volume and smaller pore size could block more particles in the bulk liquid under a higher tmp this explains why this sfdmbr performed better in later cycles of operation with a slightly higher tmp 0 4 bars instead of 0 2 bars fig 2 however when the tmp reached 0 8 bars the effluent quality dropped dramatically despite the high compactness of the dynamic layer which cannot be explained by the physical properties of the dynamic layer therefore the relationship between the dynamic layer and the supporting mesh was further investigated after fouling 3 3 relationship between the dynamic layer and the supporting mesh the sem images of the back surface of the supporting mesh with the dynamic layer on it reveal that the dynamic layer had been pushed into the pores of the mesh fig 4 after being compressed and pushed into the pores the dynamic layer started to break down along the fibers of the supporting mesh fig 4a and b numerous straight cracks appeared in the dynamic layer on the back surface of the mesh which might result in protruding parts with smooth edges and similar size with the pores of the supporting mesh a majority protruding parts could be dissociated from the dynamic layer and appeared in the permeate under continuous pressure and local flux a black spot on the dynamic layer at the same confocal plane with supporting mesh could be seen clearly from the clsm images of α polysaccharides fig 5 a proteins fig 5c and bacterial cells fig 5d on the back surface of the supporting mesh see the white circles which could be formed due to the protruding parts dissociation β polysaccharides were tightly attached to the supporting mesh fibers and therefore the black spot formed from the dynamic layer dissociation cannot be seen the shape and size of the black spot matched the protruding part shown in sem images fig 4 hence the properties of particles in the permeate were extensively studied for comparison 3 4 permeate particles the morphology and size of particles in the permeate under different tmps were investigated and are shown in fig 6 in the sem images the permeate particles are approximately 20 μm in length regardless of the operating tmp this length matched the pore size of the mesh 20 71 4 60 μm and the crack protruding part and black spot observed at the back of the supporting mesh figs 4 and 5 moreover the diameter of the particles was stably distributed around 20 μm when the tmp was 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 bars fig 6e under high pressure 0 8 bars the permeate particle size increased slightly due to the high compactness of the dynamic layer which is consistent with the sem image showing a clear cubic shape with a side length of approximately 20 μm in summary the size distribution of the permeate particles and the physical and chemical properties of the mesh confirmed that the majority of suspended solids in the permeate was attributed to particles dissociated from the dynamic layer 3 5 tests with different mesh sizes batch tests with different mesh sizes were also conducted to confirm the relationship between permeate particle properties and mesh size at a lower tmp 0 2 bars fig 7 a shows the particle size distribution of activated sludge and the permeate produced using four different meshes with the pore sizes of 13 20 23 and 35 μm the mean particle size of the activated sludge in the reactor was kept above 75 μm for all four supporting meshes the permeate particles were obviously smaller than the activated sludge flocs indicating that the meshes blocked most of the sludge flocs from the bulk liquid effectively as the mesh pore size decreased the permeate particles became smaller as well fig 7b shows the correlation between the average mesh pore size and the mode size of permeate particles with the intercept set at zero the permeate particle size showed a linear relationship with the mesh pore size r2 0 9318 the linear regression indicated that the permeate particles were 1 13 times larger than the supporting mesh pores because the mesh pore size was calculated based on the side length and the particle size was measured three dimensionally it can be concluded that no matter which supporting mesh was used the permeate particles had the same size as the mesh pores after the mature dynamic layer was formed on the supporting mesh the chemical properties of the permeate particles from different meshes were also observed under a clsm with epss distribution staining to further confirm the source of permeate particles the shape and size of permeate particles shown in the images fig 8 are consistent with the results of particle size distribution fig 7 the permeate particles were a mixture of bacterial cells proteins and polysaccharides which is consistent with the structure of the dynamic layer fig 5 further demonstrating that the permeate particles were came from the dissociation of the dynamic layer even when the tmp was as low as 0 2 bars however the β polysaccharide was distributed differently in the permeate particles than in the dynamic layer in permeate particles the β polysaccharide was only distributed in the center of the particles with a lower fluorescent intensity than the other components fig 8a2 d2 according to observations of the back surface of the supporting mesh β polysaccharide was tightly attached to the supporting material fibers fig 5b these results indicated that β polysaccharide attached more easily to the mesh fiber than did other types of epss β polysaccharide residuals accumulated on the mesh fibers as the dynamic layer gradually dissociated from the supporting mesh especially when the system was operated under high pressure this phenomenon might explain the quick jump in tmp in the fouling phase based on the findings above a mechanism consisting of three steps dynamic layer compression breakdown and dissociation in sfdmbrs is proposed the first step is dynamic layer compression with the increase in tmp and local flux after the formation of the dynamic layer on the supporting material during this step the dynamic layer is continuously compacted from a loosely bound structure to a tightly bound one the compacted dynamic layer with a smaller pore size and pore volume results in a simultaneous increase in tmp therefore the compactness of the dynamic layer and tmp drive each other in this step meanwhile the compacted dynamic layer can act as an effective filtration material that produces the permeate with the highest quality once the dynamic layer is largely compacted the tmp and local flux can be greatly increased to provide suitable conditions for the breakdown stage in the second step the dynamic layer breaks down along the fibers and is forced into the pores of the supporting material protruding parts form on the back surface of the supporting material at the end of this step due to persistent increase of tmp and local flux in the third step known as the dissociation step the protruding parts are further pushed out from the mesh pores and will eventually dissociate from the dynamic layer and enter the permeate these three steps are repeated during sfdmbr operation so the majority of particles in the permeate come from the pieces of the dynamic layer during the fouling phase the significantly increased tmp and local flux accelerate these three steps 4 conclusions in this study an sfdmbr system was stably operated for more than 80 days by investigating the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and permeate particles the relationship between the two in sfdmbrs is revealed after the successful formation of the dynamic layer the particles in the permeate are mainly formed from the dissociation of the dynamic layer on the back surface of the supporting mesh which size is determined by the pore size of supporting mesh the compression breakdown and dissociation of the dynamic layer were observed directly in experiment instead of model prediction or conjecture for the first time the compression breakdown and dissociation of dynamic layer were getting severe at higher tmp so the number of particles in permeate increased with the build up of the tmp a proper tmp range less than 0 6 bars should be maintained for efficient sfdmbr filtration and to prevent severe dynamic layer breakdown and deterioration of permeate quality β polysaccharide can easily accumulate on the mesh fibers as foulant during long term operation and should be prevented which can be further investigated in future studies in summary the change in the physical structure of the dynamic layer in sfdmbrs involving compression breakdown and dissociation proposed in this study can accurately explain permeate deterioration tmp control is very important for the stable operation of sfdmbr with persistent good effluent quality the time based backwash regulation can be supplemented by the tmp based one to benefit a better operation of sfdmbr for stable permeate quality the results provide a novel exploration direction as well as guidelines for applying this technology the mechanism proposed in this study should be further confirmed with more experiments conducted with real wastewater treatment in future and the system performance would be extensively evaluated the relationship between dynamic layer dissociation and β polysaccharide accumulation on the supporting material fibers is worth being investigated acknowledgments this work was supported by the hong kong innovation and technology commission grant numbers itc cnerc14eg03

relative abundance of bacteria genera is shown in fig 8 the main nitrifying genera was nitrosomonas and the denitrifying genera in wwtp were thiobacillus thauera thioalbus luteimonas and gulbenkiania blazkova et al 2017 park et al 2011 vaz moreira et al 2007 the members of truepera luteimonas and gulbenkiania were cold adapted vaz moreira et al 2007 from dec 2015 to dec 2016 the means of relative

25 48 and from 29 24 to 35 64 respectively 4 discussion the shale refinery was put into operation in 2012 and deeply processed approximately 400 000 t of shale oil annually during the production process it produced a large amount of retort wastewater at the initial stage of production the retort wastewater was used for directly quenching coke and pouring onto coal slag at the end of 2012 the company prepared to construct a wwtp to treat the oil shale wastewater in may 2014 debugging of the wwtp was started in january 2015 the basic commissioning was stable at present there is no specific stipulation of the standards for the recycling of oil shale retorting wastewater in china the water quality index of oil shale wastewater reused for the circulating cooling system should implement the recirculating cooling system replenishing water part of the code for design of wastewater reclamation and reuse gb t 50335 2002 however this standard does not require the removal of no3 n and the wastewater treatment plant mainly uses cod and ammonia nitrogen as target pollutants although there is no limit to no3 n emission in the code for design of recirculating cooling system replenishing water gb t 50335 2002 this no3 n will eventually be released into the environment when the recirculating cooling replenishing water after being reused many times is used to pour coal slag since the company began operation we have conducted a large number of studies on treating high ammonia nitrogen and low c n oil shale wastewater with the aim to find an efficient removal method for high cod ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen the lab scale experiments explored whether electrocoagulation could promote nitrogen removal at low temperatures and if electrocoagulation was more helpful for nitrification or denitrification for the pilot scale systems the electrocoagulation equipment was installed in an anaerobic zone and an aerobic zone results revealed that electrocoagulation was able to enhance both nitrification and denitrification the pilot scale experiments further explored the effect of electrocoagulation on microbial activity and on cod and nitrogen removal performance in a conventional complete nitrification denitrification process multistage a o membrane bioreactors mimicked the wwtp and could provide technical support for better nitrogen removal in the wwtp for the wwtp some operational parameters were consistent with those in the pilot scale system 4 1 effect of electrocoagulation on biological nitrogen removal the results suggest that electrocoagulation can increase nh4 n and tn removal in lab scale systems pilot scale systems and a full scale wwtp figs 1 and 2 according to a previous mechanism study the electrocoagulation primarily enhances nh4 n removal by stimulating microorganisms qian et al 2017 the effects of electrocoagulation on microorganisms occur in relation to two aspects electric fields and dissolved iron the electric fields may increase electron flow and form some free radicals wang et al 2015b iron is an essential element for microbes and the active center of some oxidases li et al 2009 xie et al 2017 appropriate iron ions are capable of exerting stimulating effects on bacterial metabolism thereby affecting mlvss and biomass ma et al 2017 in fig 4 the results show that electrocoagulation may enhance nitrifying and denitrifying enzymes as shown in fig 3 not all of the vmax values in bio electrocoagulation systems were higher than those in conventional systems based on statistical analysis the overall nitrogen removal performance in bio electrocoagulation systems was stronger vmax is the utilisation of unit sludge on the substrate per unit time this indicated that the mlvss played a crucial role in overall nitrogen removal whereas in bio electrocoagulation systems biomass was superior figs 1 3 as presented in figs 6 and 7a the nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms in bio electrocoagulation systems were apparently more abundant than those in conventional reactors suggesting that electrocoagulation may increase these nitrogen removal microbes this increase was attributed to better nitrogen removal performance in bio electrocoagulation systems thus electrocoagulation may improve enzyme activity biomass and amount of nitrogen removal microorganisms to enhance the performance of nitrogen removal 4 2 bio electrocoagulation performance at low temperatures in the lab scale and pilot scale studies the performance of bio electrocoagulation systems was stronger than that of the ordinary system at low temperatures figs 1 3 and 4 based on the data in fig 3 the changes of vmax in the lab scale and pilot scale systems were irregular although the nitrogen removal efficiency in ordinary systems was always lower at low temperatures some vmax of ordinary systems was higher such as the ammonia oxidation rate of sn2 and the denitrification rate of mmbr at 10 c thus the mlvss exerted a great impact on vmax for the biomass the mlvss in bio electrocoagulation systems was greater moreover the gap of mlvss between the two types of systems was wider at low temperatures these findings indicated that electrocoagulation might improve performance altogether by increasing the biomass amount under low temperature conditions performances including that of the biomass and of the nitrifying and denitrifying enzyme activities in bio electrocoagulation systems were also better at low temperatures in the pilot scale system an analysis of the 16s rdna sequence illustrated that trueperaceae b42 belongs to family trueperaceae members of this family are able to grow under extreme conditions such as in moderate saline and the alkaline as well as extreme temperature habitats albuquerque et al 2005 ivanova et al 2011 luteimonas is gram negative rod shaped and cold adapted 1 25 c zhang et al 2010 some strains of luteimonas can survive in hydrocarbon contaminated soil zhang et al 2010 carnobacteriaceae genus is in family carnobacteriaceae members of which exhibit cold tolerance nicholson et al 2016 the predominant microbes carnobacteriaceae genus luteimonas and trueperaceae b42 are psychrotrophs as shown in fig 7b the results revealed that electrocoagulation had the capacity to stimulate these cold adapted microbes to increase their abundance under low temperature conditions which explained why the bio electrocoagulation systems were able to maintain relatively better performance levels at low temperatures thus electrocoagulation can improve the biomass enzyme activity and relative abundance of cold adapted microbes and allow the system to sustain superior performance at low temperatures 4 3 effect of electrocoagulation at a full scale wwtp in 2013 2015 the influent cod and nh4 n of the wwtp were 3588 4527 and 3046 4192 mg l respectively the nanofiltration effluents could meet the standard of the recirculating cooling system replenishing water of the code for design of wastewater reclamation and reuse gb t 50335 2002 at the end of 2015 the new oil shale being collected was different from the previous oil shales which caused the influent cod and nh4 n of the wwtp to rise to 6143 7251 and 4571 5575 mg l respectively the nanofiltration effluent cod and nh4 n were more than 60 and 10 mg l respectively in winter moreover to ensure the nanofiltration effluent quality the mbr effluent cod and nh4 n should be less than 1000 and 100 mg l respectively in the laboratory study lab scale and pilot scale systems the electrocoagulation technique was able to enhance nitrogen removal performance at low temperatures in the pilot scale systems the electrocoagulation technology had the power to reduce effluent nh4 n by 50 at 10 c to improve the removal efficiency of cod and nh4 n from the biochemical pool full scale electrocoagulation devices were installed in the wwtp in jun 2016 as shown in fig 2 electrocoagulation was able to slightly increase the mlvss of the wwtp in cold winters compared with the laboratory study the mlvss of the wwtp did not change much hence the effect of mlvss on vmax in the wwtp was not as obvious as that in laboratory studies by comparison the vmax increased in winter 2016 which meant that electrocoagulation can enhance the utilisation of unit sludge per unit time in case of slight changes in the mlvss fig 3 based on calculations a comparison of winter 2015 nov 2015 jan 2016 and 2016 nov 2016 jan 2017 showed that effluent cod nh4 n and no3 n were reduced by 10 37 3 84 and 136 43 t respectively in winter 2016 fig 2 from analysis of the 16s rdna sequence the microbes in the wwtp were classified into 19 major genera fig 8a members of thiobacillus which belongs to class betaproteobacteria are able to remove nitrates blazkova et al 2017 blazkova et al 2017 found that a small amount of iron can significantly increase nitrate removal by thiobacillus which is consistent with the wwtp results thauera is famous for its denitrification capacity du et al 2017 in addition to its capacity for cold adaptivity luteimonas can reduce no2 n finkmann et al 2000 thioalbus is an autotrophic sulphur oxidising bacterium which can grow under aerobic and denitrifying chemolithoautotrophic conditions park et al 2011 gulbenkiania can survive at the relatively low temperature of 15 c and reduce nitrate to nitrite vaz moreira et al 2007 sphingomonas has the ability to degrade hard removal compounds in petroleum oil such as carbazole kirimura et al 1999 nonylphenol cirja et al 2009 phenol gong et al 2016 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons zhou et al 2016 gemmatimonas belonging to the class gemmatimonadetes is a rod shaped and gram negative aerobe zhang et al 2003 gemmatimonas is able to utilise benzoate and acetate among other things which are potential intermediates of volatile phenols rhodopseudomonas has strong adaptability and can tolerate wastewater with highly concentrated organics rhodopseudomonas has the ability to decompose phenol noh et al 2002 truepera belongs to family trueperaceae which can adapt to extreme environments and degrade organic acids polyols carbohydrates and amino acids these are all potential intermediates of volatile phenol degradation albuquerque et al 2005 among them all the dominant nitrifying microbial genus was nitrosomonas thiobacillus thauera thioalbus luteimonas and gulbenkiania have denitrification ability truepera luteimonas and gulbenkiania also may adapt to the cold rhodopseudomonas sphingomonas gemmatimonas and truepera have the ability to directly or indirectly degrade phenols similar to the lab and pilot test results fig 8 shows that full scale electrocoagulation devices may increase nitrification denitrification and cold adaptivity of bacteria which was the key reason for nh4 n reduction in the winter of 2016 therefore one may say that electrocoagulation improved the biomass vmax and relative abundance of nitrifying and cold adapted microbes to help the wwtp meet effluent cod and nh4 n standard gb t 50335 2002 in winter additionally the electrocoagulation device improved the relative abundance of denitrifying microbes that reduce the effluent no3 n which contributed to the reduction of total no3 n in the area 5 conclusions a major goal of this research was to study the enhancement effect of a periodically reversed current electrocoagulation technology on biological nitrogen removal at low temperatures the results showed that electrocoagulation technology may improve the biomass enzyme activity and relative abundance of nitrogen removing and cold adapted microbes this enhances the nitrogen removal capacity of activated sludge under low temperature conditions in the full scale industrial wwtp the electrocoagulation devices were able to reduce effluent cod nh4 n and no3 n by 10 37 3 84 and 136 43 t respectively in winter 2016 acknowledgements

19529,in cold areas nitrogen removal performance of wastewater treatment plants wwtp declines greatly in winter this paper systematically describes the enhancement effect of a periodic reverse electrocoagulation technology on biological nitrogen removal at low temperatures the study showed that in the lab scale systems the electrocoagulation technology improved the biomass amount enzyme

winter after installation of electrocoagulation devices these results suggest that the electrocoagulation technology is able to improve the performance of activated sludge under low temperature conditions this technology provides a new way for upgrading of the performance of wwtps in cold areas graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrocoagulation low temperature full scale wwtp microbial community structure enzyme activity 1 introduction with rapid development of the societies and economies in developing countries environmental problems are increasingly serious nowadays large amounts of nitrogen are discharged into the water which causes water degradation and is a potential hazard to human health li et al 2015 biological nitrogen removal is the most widely used nh4 n removal process in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps because it is relatively inexpensive and results in less re pollution kenari et al 2010 in many areas of northern china the average temperature

system performance in the short term whereas the ease of loss and poor activity when dosing bacteria limit the long tern applications of this approach in wwtps some high ammonia nitrogen producing industrial wwtps added an air stripping process before biological treatment to make the effluent ammonia nitrogen meet the emission standards although the air stripping technique can improve ammonia removal efficiency in water bonmatı and flotats 2003 it will produce serious air re pollution to enhance the nitrogen removal performance of microbes especially at low temperatures a new periodic reversal bio electrocoagulation system prbes was proposed that combines electrochemical and biological techniques the prbes usually uses active metals such as ferrum and inert materials as electrodes with a dc power supply that periodically reverses in the prbes the active metal is able to produce metal cations when it is an anode the timing of periodic reversal device has the power to manage the amount of dissolved metal the main function of the electrocoagulation device is to use the dissolved irons and electric field to stimulate the microbes our previous study showed that most of the nh4 n was oxidized by microorganisms in the prbes and the electrode primarily stimulated microbes to indirectly enhance nh4 n removal qian et al 2017 the study indicated that it is possible to apply this electrocoagulation technology in a full scale wwtp the present study focused on the enhancement of biological nitrogen removal at low temperatures using the electrocoagulation technology in this research the nitrogen removal ability of these bio electrocoagulation systems was systematically studied in lab scale systems pilot scale systems and a full scale industrial wwtp under low temperature

from 20 12 mg l at 20 c to 130 01 mg l at 10 c in sn2 that is the removal efficiency of nh4 n decreased from 98 27 at 20 c to 76 26 at 10 c in sn1 and from 90 01 at 20 c to 35 45 at 10 c in sn2 the

7 93e 05 and 4 07e 05 mg mg min at 20 c and were 5 12e 05 and 2 61e 05 mg mg min at 10 c respectively for sd1 and sd2 the vmax of the denitrification rate was higher in sd1 at any temperature over a 62 day period the nitrifying and denitrifying enzyme activities were measured in the four lab scale reactors fig 4 in the nitrification systems nitrite oxidoreductase nor hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and ammonia monooxygenase amo concentrations in sn1 were higher than those in sn2 at 20 and 10 c similarly nitrous oxide reductase nos nitric oxide reductase nor nitrite reductase nir and nitrate

the relative abundance of members of the microbial community at genus level in the four sbrs the major genera of microorganisms in the nitrification system were found to be hyphomicrobium paracoccus nitrobacter nitrosomonas thauera and hydrogenophaga fig 5a hyphomicrobium thauera paracoccus saccharibacteria genera and enterobacter were predominant in the denitrification system fig 5b the relative abundances of the major nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria are shown in fig 6 in the nitrification system the ammonium oxidising genus nitrosomonas keluskar et al 2013 and the nitrite oxidising genus nitrobacter winkler et al 2015 showed a trend of increase during the experiment the relative abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrobacter in sn1 were higher than those in sn2 in the denitrification system the major denitrifying bacteria were of the genera hyphomicrobium paracoccus thauera and enterobacter urakami et al 1991 chen et al 2016 du et al 2016 guo et al 2016 the sum of the relative abundances of the denitrifying bacteria in sd1 increased from 59 62 at 20 c to 64 61 at 10 c in sd2 these remained at approximately 47 during the experiment 3 2 effect of the electrocoagulation on biological nitrogen removal at low temperatures in two pilot scale systems 3 2 1 performances of the pilot scale systems over a 91 day period the common indices and iron ions were tested in the pilot scale system fig 1c the effluent cod in ecmmbr was 313 66 257 64 and 245 13 mg l at 10 15 and 20 c respectively the corresponding cod of the effluent from the mmbr was 693 38 492 34 and 339 05 mg l the effluent nh4 n decreased from 165 12 to 3 58 mg l in the ecmmbr and from 334 6 to 6 28 mg l in the mmbr with rising temperature similarly the effluent tn decreased from 535 79 to 324 19 mg l in the ecmmbr and from 734 16 to 501 35 mg l in the mmbr during the experiment based on statistical analysis the average mlvss in the ecmmbr and mmbr was 3851 17 and 3008 37 mg l respectively it is apparent that the cod nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies in the two systems increased as the temperature rose moreover they were higher in the ecmmbr especially at low temperatures 3 2 2 nitrogen transformation rate and enzyme activity similar to the lab scale systems the nitrogen transformation rate and enzyme activity were measured in the ecmmbr and mmbr at 10 and 20 c as shown in fig 3 the vmax of the nitrification rate and denitrification rate in the two reactors showed an upward trend with rising temperature for the ammonia oxidation rate and nitrite oxidation rate the vmax in the ecmmbr was higher than that in the mmbr however for the denitrification rate the vmax in the ecmmbr was lower in fig 4 similarly the nitrifying and denitrifying enzyme activities of the two pilot scale reactors increased as the temperature rose in a comparison of the two reactors the nitrifying and denitrifying enzyme activities in the ecmmbr were stronger 3 2 3 microbial community structure the relative abundance of genera in the microbial community in the two reactors at 10 and 20 c is shown in fig 7 the dominant microorganism was trueperaceae b42 hyphomicrobium luteimonas nitrosomonadaceae genus carnobacteriaceae genus hylemonella and pseudomonas the primary nitrifying bacteria were nitrosomonadaceae genus which increased with rising temperature in the two reactors fig 7a carnobacteriaceae genus nicholson et al 2016 luteimonas zhang et al 2010 and trueperaceae b42 al kharusi et al 2016 were the psychrotrophs on comparing the two reactors the sum of the relative abundances of these psychrotrophs in the ecmmbr was found to be greater especially at low temperatures fig 7b 3 3 effect of electrocoagulation on biological nitrogen removal at low temperatures in a full scale industrial wastewater treatment plant 3 3 1 environmental variables and nitrogen transformation rate environmental variables for the wwtp from jan 2015 to jan 2017 are summarized in fig 2 the influent water quality changed after oct 2015 and the full scale electrocoagulation devices were installed in jun 2016 before nov 2015 the influent cod and nh4 n were 4038 4513 and 3145 3811 mg l respectively the nanofiltration effluent cod and nh4 n concentrations were below 60 and 10 mg l respectively the mean concentrations of mlvss and iron were 6863 8 and 0 14 mg l after nov 2015 the influent cod and nh4 n concentrations rose to approximately 6600 and 5300 mg l respectively between nov 2015 and jun 2016 the mbr effluent cod was 767 1249 mg l and the nanofiltration effluent cod was 47 6 92 4 mg l the mbr effluent nh4 n was 56 9 137 3 mg l and the nanofiltration effluent nh4 n was 4 7 18 6 mg l the mean concentrations of mlvss and iron were 6623 9 and 0 14 mg l after jun 2016 the effluent cod and nh4 n remained at relatively low levels cod 660 929 mg l in the mbr effluent and 42 9 53 3 mg l in the nanofiltration effluent nh4 n 14 8 69 4 mg l in the mbr and 1 7 3 7 mg l from nanofiltration the mean concentrations of mlvss and iron increased to 6975 3 and 1 63 mg l respectively as shown in fig 3 the ammonia oxidation rate nitrite oxidation rate and denitrification rate were tested every month and the vmax of each was obtained over the 15 month monitoring period the mean vmax of the ammonia oxidation rate nitrite oxidation rate and denitrification rate was 9 01e 05 6 92e 05 and 2 37e 05 mg mg min before jun 2016 after jun 2016 the mean vmax of each increased to 1 32e 04 1 11e 04 and 3 10e 05 mg mg min respectively 3 3 2 microbial community structure the microbial relative abundance of bacteria genera is shown in fig 8 the main nitrifying genera was nitrosomonas and the denitrifying genera in wwtp were thiobacillus thauera thioalbus luteimonas and gulbenkiania blazkova et al 2017 park et al 2011 vaz moreira et al 2007 the members of truepera luteimonas and gulbenkiania were cold adapted vaz moreira et al 2007 from dec 2015 to dec 2016 the means of relative abundance of nitrosomonas rose from 5 604 to 7 986 as shown in fig 8b and c the means of the sums of relative abundance of the denitrifying bacteria and cold adapted bacteria increased from 21 12 to 25 48 and from 29 24 to 35 64 respectively 4 discussion the shale refinery was put into operation in 2012 and deeply processed approximately 400 000 t of shale oil annually during the production process it produced a large amount of retort wastewater at the initial stage of production the retort wastewater was used for directly quenching coke and pouring onto coal slag at the end of 2012 the company prepared to construct a wwtp to treat the oil shale wastewater in may 2014 debugging of the wwtp was started in january 2015 the basic commissioning was stable at present there is no specific stipulation of the standards for the recycling of oil shale retorting wastewater in china the water quality index of oil shale wastewater reused for the circulating cooling system should implement the recirculating cooling system replenishing water part of the code for design of wastewater reclamation and reuse gb t 50335 2002 however this standard does not require the removal of no3 n and the wastewater treatment plant mainly uses cod and ammonia nitrogen as target pollutants although there is no limit to no3 n emission in the code for design of recirculating cooling system replenishing water gb t 50335 2002 this no3 n will eventually be released into the environment when the recirculating cooling replenishing water after being reused many times is used to pour coal slag since the company began operation we have conducted a large number of studies on treating high ammonia nitrogen and low c n oil shale wastewater with the aim to find an efficient removal method for high cod ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen the lab scale experiments explored whether electrocoagulation could promote nitrogen removal at low temperatures and if electrocoagulation was more helpful for nitrification or denitrification for the pilot scale systems the electrocoagulation equipment was installed in an anaerobic zone and an aerobic zone results revealed that electrocoagulation was able to enhance both nitrification and denitrification the pilot scale experiments further explored the effect of electrocoagulation on microbial activity and on cod and nitrogen removal performance in a conventional complete nitrification denitrification process multistage a o membrane bioreactors mimicked the wwtp and could provide technical support for better nitrogen removal in the wwtp for the wwtp some operational parameters were consistent with those in the pilot scale system 4 1 effect of electrocoagulation on biological nitrogen removal the results suggest that electrocoagulation can increase nh4 n and tn removal in lab scale systems pilot scale systems and a full scale wwtp figs 1 and 2 according to a previous mechanism study the electrocoagulation primarily enhances nh4 n removal by stimulating microorganisms qian et al 2017 the effects of electrocoagulation on microorganisms occur in relation to two aspects electric fields and dissolved iron the electric fields may increase electron flow and form some free radicals wang et al 2015b iron is an essential element for microbes and the active center of some oxidases li et al 2009 xie et al 2017 appropriate iron ions are capable of exerting stimulating effects on bacterial metabolism thereby affecting mlvss and biomass ma et al 2017 in fig 4 the results show that electrocoagulation may enhance nitrifying and denitrifying enzymes as shown in fig 3 not all of the vmax values in bio electrocoagulation systems were higher than those in conventional systems based on statistical analysis the overall nitrogen removal performance in bio electrocoagulation systems was stronger vmax is the utilisation of unit sludge on the substrate per unit time this indicated that the mlvss played a crucial role in overall nitrogen removal whereas in bio electrocoagulation systems biomass was superior figs 1 3 as presented in figs 6 and 7a the nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms in bio electrocoagulation systems were apparently more abundant than those in conventional reactors suggesting that electrocoagulation may increase these nitrogen removal microbes this increase was attributed to better nitrogen removal performance in bio electrocoagulation systems thus electrocoagulation may improve enzyme activity biomass and amount of nitrogen removal microorganisms to enhance the performance of nitrogen removal 4 2 bio electrocoagulation performance at low temperatures in the lab scale and pilot scale studies the performance of bio electrocoagulation systems was stronger than that of the ordinary system at low temperatures figs 1 3 and 4 based on the data in fig 3 the changes of vmax in the lab scale and pilot scale systems were irregular although the nitrogen removal efficiency in ordinary systems was always lower at low temperatures some vmax of ordinary systems was higher such as the ammonia oxidation rate of sn2 and the denitrification rate of mmbr at 10 c thus the mlvss exerted a great impact on vmax for the biomass the mlvss in bio electrocoagulation systems was greater moreover the gap of mlvss between the two types of systems was wider at low temperatures these findings indicated that electrocoagulation might improve performance altogether by increasing the biomass amount under low temperature conditions performances including that of the biomass and of the nitrifying and denitrifying enzyme activities in bio electrocoagulation systems were also better at low temperatures in the pilot scale system an analysis of the 16s rdna sequence illustrated that trueperaceae b42 belongs to family trueperaceae members of this family are able to grow under extreme conditions such as in moderate saline and the alkaline as well as extreme temperature habitats albuquerque et al 2005 ivanova et al 2011 luteimonas is gram negative rod shaped and cold adapted 1 25 c zhang et al 2010 some strains of luteimonas can survive in hydrocarbon contaminated soil zhang et al 2010 carnobacteriaceae genus is in family carnobacteriaceae members of which exhibit cold tolerance nicholson et al 2016 the predominant microbes carnobacteriaceae genus luteimonas and trueperaceae b42 are psychrotrophs as shown in fig 7b the results revealed that electrocoagulation had the capacity to stimulate these cold adapted microbes to increase their abundance under low temperature conditions which explained why the bio electrocoagulation systems were able to maintain relatively better performance levels at low temperatures thus electrocoagulation can improve the biomass enzyme activity and relative abundance of cold adapted microbes and allow the system to sustain superior performance at low temperatures 4 3 effect of electrocoagulation at a full scale wwtp in 2013 2015 the influent cod and nh4 n of the wwtp were 3588 4527 and 3046 4192 mg l respectively the nanofiltration effluents could meet the standard of the recirculating cooling system replenishing water of the code for design of wastewater reclamation and reuse gb t 50335 2002 at the end of 2015 the new oil shale being collected was different from the previous oil shales which caused the influent cod and nh4 n of the wwtp to rise to 6143 7251 and 4571 5575 mg l respectively the nanofiltration effluent cod and nh4 n were more than 60 and 10 mg l respectively in winter moreover to ensure the nanofiltration effluent quality the mbr effluent cod and nh4 n should be less than 1000 and 100 mg l respectively in the laboratory study lab scale and pilot scale systems the electrocoagulation technique was able to enhance nitrogen removal performance at low temperatures in the pilot scale systems the electrocoagulation technology had the power to reduce effluent nh4 n by 50 at 10 c to improve the removal efficiency of cod and nh4 n from the biochemical pool full scale electrocoagulation devices were installed in the wwtp in jun 2016 as shown in fig 2 electrocoagulation was able to slightly increase the mlvss of the wwtp in cold winters compared with the laboratory study the mlvss of the wwtp did not change much hence the effect of mlvss on vmax in the wwtp was not as obvious as that in laboratory studies by comparison the vmax increased in winter 2016 which meant that electrocoagulation can enhance the utilisation of unit sludge per unit time in case of slight changes in the mlvss fig 3 based on calculations a comparison of winter 2015 nov 2015 jan 2016 and 2016 nov 2016 jan 2017 showed that effluent cod nh4 n and no3 n were reduced by 10 37 3 84 and 136 43 t respectively in winter 2016 fig 2 from analysis of the 16s rdna sequence the microbes in the wwtp were classified into 19 major genera fig 8a members of thiobacillus which belongs to class betaproteobacteria are able to remove nitrates blazkova et al 2017 blazkova et al 2017 found that a small amount of iron can significantly increase nitrate removal by thiobacillus which is consistent with the wwtp results thauera is famous for its denitrification capacity du et al 2017 in addition to its capacity for cold adaptivity luteimonas can reduce no2 n finkmann et al 2000 thioalbus is an autotrophic sulphur oxidising bacterium which can grow under aerobic and denitrifying chemolithoautotrophic conditions park et al 2011 gulbenkiania can survive at the relatively low temperature of 15 c and reduce nitrate to nitrite vaz moreira et al 2007 sphingomonas has the ability to degrade hard removal compounds in petroleum oil such as carbazole kirimura et al 1999 nonylphenol cirja et al 2009 phenol gong et al 2016 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons zhou et al 2016 gemmatimonas belonging to the class gemmatimonadetes is a rod shaped and gram negative aerobe zhang et al 2003 gemmatimonas is able to utilise benzoate and acetate among other things which are potential intermediates of volatile phenols rhodopseudomonas has strong adaptability and can tolerate wastewater with highly concentrated organics rhodopseudomonas has the ability to decompose phenol noh et al 2002 truepera belongs to family trueperaceae which can adapt to extreme environments and degrade organic acids polyols carbohydrates and amino acids these are all potential intermediates of volatile phenol degradation albuquerque et al 2005 among them all the dominant nitrifying microbial genus was nitrosomonas thiobacillus thauera thioalbus luteimonas and gulbenkiania have denitrification ability truepera luteimonas and gulbenkiania also may adapt to the cold rhodopseudomonas sphingomonas gemmatimonas and truepera have the ability to directly or indirectly degrade phenols similar to the lab and pilot test results fig 8 shows that full scale electrocoagulation devices may increase nitrification denitrification and cold adaptivity of bacteria which was the key reason for nh4 n reduction in the winter of 2016 therefore one may say that electrocoagulation improved the biomass vmax and relative abundance of nitrifying and cold adapted microbes to help the wwtp meet effluent cod and nh4 n standard gb t 50335 2002 in winter additionally the electrocoagulation device improved the relative abundance of denitrifying microbes that reduce the effluent no3 n which contributed to the reduction of total no3 n in the area 5 conclusions a major goal of this research was to study the enhancement effect of a periodically reversed current electrocoagulation technology on biological nitrogen removal at low temperatures the results showed that electrocoagulation technology may improve the biomass enzyme activity and relative abundance of nitrogen removing and cold adapted microbes this enhances the nitrogen removal capacity of activated sludge under low temperature conditions in the full scale industrial wwtp the electrocoagulation devices were able to reduce effluent cod nh4 n and no3 n by 10 37 3 84 and 136 43 t respectively in winter 2016 acknowledgements
