18540,reuse of municipal wastewater is a growing global trend but currently there is lack of consensus regarding the potential dissemination of antibiotic resistance elements by treated wastewater irrigation we tracked inti1 a proxy for anthropogenic pollution and an assemblage of antibiotic resistance genes associated with mobile elements and or wastewater bla ges bla oxa2 bla oxa10 bla tem bla ctx m 32 and qnrs in treated wastewater effluents effluent stabilization reservoirs and along irrigation water soil crop continua in experimental lysimeters and large scale commercial fields while several of the targeted antibiotic resistance genes were profuse in effluents there was almost no correlation between gene abundance in irrigation water and those detected in soil and no evidence of systematic gene transfer to irrigated soil or crops in contrast soil inti1 abundance correlated strongly to irrigation water levels in lysimeters and sandy field soils but this was not the case for clay rich soils or for most of the analyzed crops suggesting that inti1 may not always be a reliable marker for tracking the impact of treated wastewater irrigation we hypothesize that ecological boundaries expedited by biotic and abiotic factors constrain dissemination of antibiotic resistance elements and assert that a more holistic perception of these factors is crucial for understanding and managing antibiotic resistance dissemination graphical abstract image 1 keywords treated wastewater irrigation antibiotic resistance antibiotic resistance gene horizontal gene transfer 1 introduction antibiotic resistance ar is a natural phenomenon that far outdates the introduction of antibiotics to modern medicine d costa et al 2011 in bacteria antibiotic resistance genes args can be acquired through horizontal or lateral gene transfer hgt davies and davies 2010 of mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids and conjugative transposons and modular genetic elements i e integrons that rely on recombination of mobile gene cassettes cambray et al 2010 martinez et al 2015 van hoek et al 2011 mges can facilitate shuttling of args from environmental non pathogenic bacteria to clinically relevant pathogens and vice versa contributing to the global propagation of antibiotic resistance bondarczuk et al 2016 tripathi and cytryn 2017 several anthropogenic sources have been identified as hotspots for dissemination of args bengtsson palme et al 2018 urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps being one of the most significant berendonk et al 2015 subsequently wwtp effluent derived antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and args especially those harbored on mges are regarded as contaminants of emerging concern cec berendonk et al 2015 pruden et al 2006 therefore microbial communities from wwtps have been intensively investigated in the last decade with multidisciplinary approaches ju et al 2018 marano and cytryn 2017 quantitative pcr qpcr provides a robust solution for evaluating args dissemination across environmental boundaries and it has been extensively applied to evaluate args in wwtps and downstream environments characterized as locations that are situated downstream from the wwtp discharge point nonetheless the a priori choice of args monitored by qpcr is as important as the outcomes of the obtained results and needs to be determined based on the characteristics of the investigated environments well operated wwtps generally reduce arb args loads by 1 2 orders of magnitude yang et al 2014 but effluents can still contain 103 108 args copies per ml that are discharged to downstream environments laht et al 2014 lapara et al 2011 in light of the above the use of treated wastewater tww for irrigation of edible crops raises questions regarding the biological safety of this practice while a few studies showed that irrigation with tww systematically contributes to args dissemination in soil microbial communities han et al 2016 others indicated that dissemination of args into such soils is similar to that observed for soils irrigated with freshwater negreanu et al 2012 orlofsky et al 2016 recycling water for agriculture is vital for maintaining food security in arid and semi arid regions where fresh water availability is limited and we expect this trend will expand in view of increasing water stress due to climate change and growing human populations however given the discrepancies described above more studies need to focus on potential epidemiological ramifications of the practice and specifically those associated with ar for example in israel a broad range of water qualities are used for irrigation based on the specific crops grown i e non edible crops can be irrigated with secondary effluent whereas unlimited irrigation requires high quality tertiary effluent inbar 2007 stabilization reservoirs are often used for storing wwtp effluents prior to irrigation to further enhance water quality and to optimize distribution of irrigation water juanico and shelef 1994 whereas storage reservoirs are often used to collect and store tww the study described here comprehensively assessed the distribution and abundance of selected args in wwtp effluents used for irrigation and evaluated their potential dissemination to soils and crops in commercial fields and controlled systems lysimeters characterized by a diverse range of soil qualities geographic locations and climatic conditions using qpcr six args that are primarily associated with mges and are profuse in wwtp effluents were targeted along with the inti1 gene which is considered a proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection an exhaustive sampling campaign was conducted at various sites in israel between 2016 and 2017 targeting wwtp effluents effluent from stabilization reservoirs irrigation water tww and fresh water fw where available see

each lysimeter which were subsequently drip irrigated for 90 days total irrigation volume per lysimeter was 440 26 l from may to july 2016 an experimental avocado orchard in northern israel established in 2015 consisted of two plots individually irrigated with fw or tww from wwtp6 table 1 the annual irrigation between march and september 2017 was 0 9 m3 per m2 finally six commercial agricultural fields irrigated with effluents of varying water quality from three different wwtps table 1 and supplementary fig 1 were investigated a fourth wwtp was included in this part of the study but its downstream commercial fields irrigated with tww were not investigated wwtp4 table 1 effluents from three of the targeted wwtps were stored in open air reservoirs 1 2 and 12 million m3 maximum water capacity for wwtp4 wwtp2 and wwtp3 respectively prior to irrigation the reservoir in wwtp3 is a stabilization reservoir where secondary effluents are stored for a minimum of 60 days to further reduce organic matter and pathogen loads followed by a final stage of chlorination table 1 supplementary table 1 whereas the other two are conventional storage reservoirs where water is stored for periods spanning a few weeks to more than two months depending on local requirements table 1 a potato field irrigated with fw in gilat israel and with no history of tww irrigation adjacent to it was included in the analyses from this field soil and potatoes were sampled in may 2016 as described below 2 2 water sampling and processing grab samples from the targeted water sources were collected in

et al 2009 all runs were performed using a steponeplus real time pcr system and analyzed with the stepone software v2 3 applied biosystems foster city ca united states the gene copy numbers generated

sample size i e volume ml of filtered water or wet weight g of soil produce pellet used for dna extraction absolute abundance of the analyzed genes was expressed as copies ml 1 water or copies g 1 soil and crops whereas the relative abundance of inti1 and the targeted args was calculated in each dna extract as the ratio between each gene and the 16s rrna copy number μl 1 and was expressed as copies 16s rrna 1 when qpcr copy number outputs were below the limit of quantification loq i e were under 10 copies μl 1 but above the theoretical limit of qpcr three copies per reaction according to bustin et al 2009 they were addressed as detectable but not quantifiable dbnq 2 6 isolation of cefotaxime resistant and total coliforms a recent study described a surveillance approach for evaluating clinically relevant arb in wwtps by targeting total and cefotaxime resistant fecal coliforms marano and fernandes et al unpublished this approach was applied to water samples along a secondary tertiary tww storage reservoir continuum linked to wwtp2 to assess arb dynamics concomitantly to the culture independent args evaluation sampling was conducted in december 2016 january february august

by r packages ggplot2 wickham 2016 in r r core team 2013 and pheatmap kolde 2019 3 results 3 1 bacterial abundance integrons and args in effluents reservoirs and irrigation water bacterial load in the different water samples was estimated by measuring16s rrna gene abundance using qpcr values ranged from 108 to 106 copies ml 1 in secondary effluent from 106 to 105 copies ml 1 following disinfection from 107 to 105 copies ml 1 in stabilization reservoirs and between 106 to 102 copies ml 1 in the analyzed fresh water samples assessment of bacterial load along the wwtp2 continuum supplementary fig 1 revealed that this was reduced in the tertiary treatment by 1 log but remained within the same order of magnitude when comparing the tertiary effluents to the receiving storage reservoir reflecting a rather steady total bacterial load between the two stages this observation was also true for the water stored in the wwtp4 effluent reservoir in contrast bacterial load in the reservoir receiving wwtp3 effluents were reduced by 1 log with respect to the other reservoirs as this water is subjected to chlorination after a two months stabilization period but prior to use supplementary table 1 fig 1 collectively displays the absolute and relative abundance of inti1 and the args in all of the water samples on average inti1 was the most abundant of the analyzed genes whereas bla ctx m 32 was the least abundant for the most part the relative and absolute abundances of the genes that were consistently quantifiable in secondary and tertiary tww samples showed comparable ranges for the same treatment compartments at the different sampling times fig 1 the effects of disinfection on the targeted genes abundance copies ml 1 could be compared only between wwtp2 and wwtp3 where both secondary and tertiary effluents were sampled wwt3 showed a higher reduction of the tested genes 2 logs with respect to 1 log of wwtp2 fig 1 despite the fact that in wwtp2 the secondary effluent is subjected to two disinfection technologies applied in series i e chlorination and uv radiation supplementary table 1 noticeably most of the args and the inti1 relative abundances systematically displayed a 1 log decrease when comparing wwtp effluents to the three downstream reservoirs the bla oxa10 and bla ges β lactamase genes were ubiquitous in all of the secondary and tertiary effluents but were not detected in any of the fw samples suggesting that these genes are good proxies for wwtp source tracking the bla oxa2 gene was also ubiquitous in secondary and tertiary effluents but was not consistently detected in the reservoirs and was detected and quantified in the may fw lysimeter sample suggesting that it might not be solely associated with wastewater genes bla tem and qnrs were detected in fresh water samples and thus they could not be consistently linked to specific water qualities or compartments and therefore may not be optimal for source tracking of args derived from tww in downstream environments bla ctx m 32 displayed a more erratic behavior and was only detected in some of the effluent samples specific attention was given to the absolute and relative abundances of inti1 in the water samples because it was the most profuse of the analyzed genes and is considered a proxy for anthropogenic pollution supplementary fig 2 collectively inti1 abundance was inversely correlated to the level of effluent treatment in the wwtp3 reservoir inti1 values were dbnq in the march 2016 profile but exceeded 103 copies ml 1 in the june 2016 profile evidently depicting the scenario in which this reservoir is filled with rainwater during the winter and with effluent in the summer 3 2 distribution of cefotaxime resistant fecal coliforms along a secondary tertiary reservoir continuum a targeted culture based approach was applied to evaluate the distribution of cefotaxime resistant fecal coliforms along a secondary effluent tertiary effluent reservoir continuum in wwtp2 to complement the culture independent qpcr analyses described above resistance to the third generation cephalosporin cefotaxime in fecal coliforms is often associated with extended spectrum β lactamases and therefore the abundance of the bla oxa bla ges bla tem and bla ctx m 32 β lactamases was plotted together with the cefotaxime resistant fecal coliform ctx r fc abundance fig 2 total and ctx r fc abundance cfus ml 1 and β lactamase genes abundance decreased from influents to effluents supplementary fig 3 and ctx r fcs and most of the targeted β lactamases excluding bla oxa10 were not detected in the reservoir samples fig 1 storage time indicated in table 1 in contrast 16s rrna gene abundance and total coliform abundances respectively were maintained within the same order of magnitude in both tertiary effluents and the reservoir suggesting similar bacterial abundance in both compartments albeit a shift in the bacterial community harboring fewer β lactamases 3 3 distribution of args and inti1 in soil irrigated with treated wastewater overall 45 soil sample types from across israel 12 fw irrigated soils and 32 tww irrigated soils supplementary fig 1 were analyzed during the irrigation season spanning from march to july 2016 and march to september 2017 collectively the 16s rrna gene abundance in the soils ranged between 1 8 109 5 9 108 lysimiters 2 109 1 2 109 experimental orchard and 1 9 109 1 4 109 commercial fields with an overall average of 1 109 copies g 1 in the present study the lowest quantifiable gene copy number per gram of soil i e above limit of quantification loq was 2 104 copies similar to detection levels described by fortunato et al 2018 however the average 109 copies g 1 of 16s rrna in soils implies that if a given target gene is quantifiable only above 2 104 copies in a gram of soil the resolution in copies 16s rrna 1 would be as little as 2 10 5 while inti1 was quantifiable in almost all of the analyzed soils most of the args were below loq the abundance of the targeted args in both soils and crops from commercial fields are detailed in supplementary tables 5 and 6 the abundance of inti1 the two effluent associated β lactamase markers bla oxa10 and bla ges and the environmentally profuse β lactamase bla tem were specifically assessed along irrigation water soil crop continua of the lysimeter orchard and commercial field experiments fig 3 this comparison between the absolute gene copy levels in the irrigating water and the receiving soils crops was made for these genes based on the hypothesis that soils and crops exposed to arg rich water would have higher probability of acquiring them for inti1 an effect related to tww irrigation was particularly clear in the lysimeter soils see below but this inverse correlation between water quality and inti1 gene abundance in soil and crops was not always observed in the field samples suggesting that other factors beyond water quality may dictate inti1 abundance in soil and crops bla oxa10 and bla ges were not detected in soils and crops irrigated with tww with a few exceptions for bla oxa10 detected in the lysimeter systems fig 3 whereas bla tem displayed a rather stochastic distribution in soil crop matrixes special attention was given to inti1 in the lysimeter samples and it was observed that irrigation with tww increased both relative and absolute abundance of this gene in all of the analyzed soil types when compared with the parallel lysimeters irrigated with fresh water fig 4 a and 4b inti1 was always quantifiable in the commercial fields at the beginning of the irrigation season in both soil and crop samples but in the second sampling campaign a general drop in absolute abundance occurred suggesting that soil associated biotic and abiotic parameters may dictate the abundance of inti1 in soil and crops fig 5 for the corn parsley and carrot fields clayey soils a direct correlation was not observed between water quality and inti1 abundance in the irrigated soils and crops in contrast there seemed to be an inverse correlation between water quality and inti1 abundance in irrigated soil in the potato field sandy soil experiments in the experimental orchard absolute and relative inti1 abundance within each site i e between biological triplicates displayed a high standard deviation which hampered the interpretation of the distribution patterns data not shown to overcome high variation associated with clayey soils such as those found in the experimental orchard in the future increasing soil sample sizes and increasing homogenization of soil samples is recommended as previously elaborated by yankson and steck 2009 4 discussion 4 1 distribution and abundance of args in wastewater wwtps are frequently seen as point sources of antibiotic resistance therefore the dissemination of arb and args to soil crops and subsequently to the food chain as a result of irrigation with tww is especially concerning in arid and semi arid regions e g israel spain cyprus and australia where crops are routinely irrigated with tww jiménez and asano 2008 in israel over 80 of municipal tww is used for irrigation kfir et al 2012 while this practice supplies water for a thriving agricultural sector it is not clear if and to what extent it might contribute to dissemination of antibiotic resistance determinants and also opportunistic pathogens in irrigated soil and produce to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that comprehensively evaluated the distribution and relative abundance of potentially mobile antibiotic resistance related genes in a broad range of experimental and commercial fields irrigated with tww of various qualities relative to when available fresh water as expected arg abundance in tww from all sampled wwtps was more copious than in fresh water and disinfection and reservoir storage substantially reduced args and inti1 abundance while the effects of disinfection on arg loads are reported in literature di cesare et al 2016 he et al 2019 jia et al 2015 less is known about the subsequent fate in reservoirs stabilization reservoirs reduce organic matter and pathogen loads in secondary effluents through natural biological processes that occur in the water column this includes further elimination of pathogens such as microbial viral or helminthic which require longer retention times compared to the conventional hydraulic retention time of wwtps and therefore local regulations dictate a minimum of sixty days followed by a chlorination prior to use of water for irrigation while stabilization reservoirs and storage reservoirs are not devised to cope with antibiotic resistance determinants per se this study complements previous studies kfir et al 2012 that demonstrated that their use can serve as a barrier to prevent spreading of certain chemical and biological contaminants to other environments for instance on average a 2 log arg reduction was observed after 60 days of storage and chlorination of secondary effluents from wwtp3 which is more than 1log reduction relative to that of wwtp2 that uses a similar chlorination setup supplementary table 1 in additional to a uv treatment stage fig 1 supplementary fig 1 recently it was shown by he et al 2019 that treatment with uv has lower inactivation capacity towards args compared to chlorination two hypotheses previously proposed by di cesare et al 2016 may explain the strong reduction in args abundance in the analyzed reservoirs on the one hand effluents let to rest in open air reservoirs may undergo a shift towards native aquatic microbial communities that outcompete arb from wwtps this might result from drastic changes in hydraulic parameters or strong shifts in limnological conditions such as diurnal cycles algae blooms competition for resources and predation on the other hand qpcr of dna extracted from samples collected immediately after disinfection might come with the bias of measuring inactivated non viable bacteria in the tertiary effluents as qpcr cannot differentiate between dead and living cells however the culture based analyses described above suggest that this is not the case at least for the reservoir downstream to wwtp2 in the latter case the observed ctx r fc cfus dynamics were consistent across five independent samplings spanning 2016 2017 fig 2 this reinforces the postulation that when possible molecular based and culture based analyses should be applied in tandem to complement each other s limitations manaia et al 2018 collectively this comprehensive analysis of effluent samples from sites across israel demonstrate that args abundance negatively correlates to the level of treatment secondary or tertiary and that effluent stabilization and storage reservoirs potentially constitute ecological barriers that reduce the dissemination of args to crops the authors believe that better understanding and proper management of these reservoirs can enhance this capacity in the future for risk assessment of arg spreading from a point source such as tww to a given receiving environment such as soil application of qpcr is only useful if it targets genes that are profuse in the source but are not abundant in the receiving environments berendonk et al 2015 gatica et al 2016 furthermore when evaluating the potential public health risks associated with dissemination of args from wastewater to receiving environments it is equally important to target genes encoding resistance to clinically important antibiotics that are associated with mobile genetic elements due to their capacity to be horizontally transferred to indigenous microbes therefore inti1 a well established proxy for anthropogenic pollution and four args that are frequently associated with plasmids and other conjugative elements were targeted of all the args bla oxa2 bla ges and especially bla oxa10 were highly prevalent in secondary effluents generally persistent in tww and almost completely absent with one exception in the analyzed fw samples these three β lactamases were previously found to be abundant and strongly associated with integrons in wwtp effluents evans and amyes 2014 gatica et al 2016 and therefore with this study they especially bla oxa10 are proposed as highly suitable candidates for source tracking of args derived from wwtps in the future furthermore bla oxa2 and bla oxa10 were previously reported to be linked to hospital sewage effluents by simo tchuinte et al 2016 which highlight both the clinical relevance of these genes and their presumptive point source a wide array of clinically relevant gene families were previously found to be strongly linked to tww gatica et al 2016 rahube et al 2014 however it is important to underline that several of these including tetracycline and aminoglicoside resistance genes were also reported to be present in soil microbial communities not exposed to tww han et al 2016 thereby not entirely fulfilling the requirements described above by berendonk et al 2015 for optimal source tracking we chose to focus primarily on β lactamases because this family is ubiquitous in clinically associated pathogens and the bla ges bla oxa2 and bla oxa10 genes were previously found to be strongly linked to tww used for irrigation but were absent in non irrigated soil gatica et al 2016 rahube et al 2014 4 2 dissemination of tww derived args in soil collectively our data from both the controlled lysimeters and the field experiments revealed low abundance of the surveyed args in all the tested soils following irrigation with tww and a complete lack of correlation between args abundance in irrigation water and that detected in the corresponding irrigated soils and crops for example in the wwtp1 june profile despite the fact that the low quality tww used for irrigation contained approximately 7 106 copies ml 1 of bla oxa10 the abundance of this gene was below detection limits in the corresponding irrigated soil and corn leaves used for animal feed albeit the fact that leaves that were close to the ground were intentionally surveyed this worst case scenario validates previously documented studies gatica et al 2015 2016 suggesting that soil constitutes a robust ecological barrier that hinders the dissemination of antibiotic resistance at least for certain args while bla tem was detected in several of the analyzed soils and crops these were clearly not be linked to irrigation with tww as the abundance in samples irrigated with fresh water was often higher than those irrigated with tww a similar observation was reported in a recent study by cerqueira et al 2019 who assessed arg dynamics in soils irrigated with tww in spain when deliberating on the potential dissemination of args across distinct ecosystems i e effluent to reservoir or effluent to soil and crops it is important to consider i the persistence of effluent derived arb in the receiving environments and ii the capacity of individual args to be horizontally transferred from effluent arb to native bacteria from soil and crops klumper et al 2015 regarding i our data strongly suggest that effluent derived arb generally do not persist in soils and crops irrigated with tww this is strongly supported by previous studies conducted in our lab gatica et al 2016 gatica and cytryn 2013 negreanu et al 2012 and by a recent study that found no difference in the abundance of several fecal bacterial indicators in soil and tomatoes that were drip irrigated in tandem with tww and fresh water despite significant differences in bacterial abundance in the two water sources orlofsky et al 2016 the authors conclude that a myriad of abiotic and biotic parameters and their interactions should be considered when evaluating the fate of args in soil and crops all beyond the quality of the tww alone these may include exposure to intense sunlight temperatures plant immune responses competing microbes and predation just to mention a few indeed the majority of soil and crop samples analyzed after several months of irrigation with tww had lower args abundance than in the early season samples despite having higher args loads in the irrigation water it is here speculated that this is attributed to higher temperature desiccation stress and radiation intensities furthermore args may also be introduced to soils and crops by sources of contamination other than irrigation water such as insects birds and rodents acting as vectors or through fecal deposition arnold et al 2016 zurek and ghosh 2014 regarding ii while hgt of args between effluent associated and soil microbiomes may occur the fact that higher arg abundances were not observed in soils irrigated with tww suggests that it either happens at extremely low frequencies or that transformation events do occur but acquired genes are rapidly lost because fitness costs of args acquisition exceed their benefits bengtsson palme et al 2018 despite our optimistic conclusions regarding the low risks of antibiotic resistance dissemination in fields irrigated with tww it is important to consider that only a limited number of args were analyzed in this study mostly β lactamase resistance genes and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that other genes may proliferate through persistence of specific effluent derived bacterial populations or through horizontal transfer of mobile elements when exposed to selective pressure forces alternatively antibiotic residuals in tww may exert selective pressure resulting in proliferation of native soil bacteria that harbor args or alternatively that acquire effluent derived args for instance a recent similar study from pan and chu 2018 showed increased args levels in soil as a consequence of irrigation with tww which were positively correlated to sulfamethazine concentrations in the tww another study by cerqueira et al 2019 found increased levels of tetm meca and bla oxa 58 in soils irrigated with tww however the authors did not test the levels of these args in the irrigating tww and soils irrigated with groundwater control were amended with manure and therefore it is not possible to determine the proportion of args detected in the treated wastewater irrigated soils that originated in the treated wastewater 4 3 class 1 integron dynamics in tww irrigated soil the class 1 integron integrase inti1 gene is often monitored along with args in surveillance studies applied to wwtps and downstream environments due to the clinical implications indicating that class 1 integrons of anthropogenic origin often harbor args and thus play a role in antibiotic resistance dissemination burch et al 2017 gatica et al 2016 gillings 2017 enrichment of inti1 in anthropogenically impacted soils has been previously reported in the literature but these were mostly linked to manure application byrne bailey et al 2011 graham et al 2016 in contrast to the targeted args where concentrations in tww did not correspond to concentrations in irrigated soils and crops the results for inti1 were conflicting positive correlations were detected between inti1 abundance in irrigation water and those in all of the lysimeter soils and the same was true for sandy soils analyzed in the wwtp2 region however this trend was not observed in soils and crops in the other regions where soils were generally heavier richer in clay content this latter observation is supported by similar studies cerqueira et al 2019 han et al 2016 jechalke et al 2015 that showed no observable influence of irrigation with tww on inti1 abundance in irrigated soils when considering the elevated inti1 abundance in the soils irrigated with tww in the case of the lysimeters and sandy field experiments three possible scenarios can be considered i persistence of effluent derived class 1 integron harboring bacteria ii horizontal transfer of extracellular effluent derived plasmids or other conjugative elements that harbor integrons to soil bacteria or iii a shift in the native soil microbiome towards a community enriched in bacteria harboring class 1 integrons the third scenario represents an alternative to the simplistic conception of inti1 as a effluent derived cec that accumulates in soils irrigated with tww it is here hypothesized that this scenario may be facilitated by increased organic carbon and nitrogen inputs from the tww organic carbon was indeed previously described as an important factor shaping microbial communities and antibiotic resistance drenovsky et al 2004 judd et al 2006 wan et al 2019 and organic enrichment was documented in two recent studies exploiting the same lysimeter system ben mordechay et al 2018 zolti et al 2019 this hypothesis is supported by the fact that bla oxa2 bla oxa10 and bla ges abundance did not increase in any of the soils irrigated with tww these three genes have previously been shown to be strongly associated with integrons in general and specifically with class 1 integrons in wastewater effluents evans and amyes 2014 gatica et al 2016 similar to the results described here gatica et al 2016 found insignificant enrichment of these args related to integrons in the upper layer of a soil exposed to secondary effluent as part of a soil aquifer treatment system when compared to adjacent soil that was not exposed to effluents unfortunately the qpcr approach applied here doesn t shed light on gene cassettes harbored by class 1 integrons or the specific phylogenetic groups that harbor class 1 integrons and therefore it cannot specifically be concluded which of the three scenarios described above best explains the increased inti1 abundance in soils irrigated with tww the authors believe that application of additional methodologies such as epic pcr and long read sequencing technologies spencer et al 2016 xia et al 2017 will help to elucidate this question collectively this study underlines that fact that the current axiom of monitoring inti1 as a proxy of anthropogenic pollution may be over simplistic and that future studies need to address the specific composition of gene cassettes harbored on class 1 integrons and the background abundance that are found in native soils 5 conclusions this study strongly suggests that dissemination of args from wastewater effluents to irrigated ecosystems is strongly limited and it highlights the fact that persistence or horizontal transfer of effluent derived args to irrigated soils and crops most likely depends on a myriad of biotic and abiotic parameters that may significantly hamper these processes from occurring in spite of the assemblage of tracked genes covering a narrow spectrum of gene families we specifically targeted args found to be abundant in tww and sparse in fresh water and background soils and demonstrated that there was no evidence of persistence of these genes in tww irrigated soils even when concentrations in tww were high the study also demonstrates that dissemination of args from anthropogenic sources to the environment cannot be projected by simplistic cause and effect scenarios but instead need to be investigating within the framework of comprehensive ecological models that integrate a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors these models need to integrate multivariate parameters such as irrigation duration soil type climate microbial diversity of the soil etc future studies should also focus on identifying rare and unpreventable hgt events that may locally reshape the resistome of soil microbial communities that cannot be identified using standard qpcr analyses because these events may have long term environmental and clinical relevance

18540,reuse of municipal wastewater is a growing global trend but currently there is lack of consensus regarding the potential dissemination of antibiotic resistance elements by treated wastewater irrigation we tracked inti1 a proxy for anthropogenic pollution and an assemblage of antibiotic resistance genes associated with mobile elements and or wastewater bla ges bla oxa2 bla oxa10 bla tem bla ctx m 32 and qnrs in treated wastewater effluents effluent stabilization reservoirs and along irrigation water soil crop continua in experimental lysimeters and large scale commercial fields while several of the targeted antibiotic resistance genes were profuse in effluents there was almost no correlation between gene abundance in irrigation water and those detected in soil and no evidence of systematic gene transfer to irrigated soil or crops in contrast soil inti1 abundance correlated strongly to irrigation water levels in lysimeters and sandy field soils but this was not the case for clay rich soils or for most of the analyzed crops suggesting that inti1 may not always be a reliable marker for tracking the impact of treated wastewater irrigation we hypothesize that ecological boundaries expedited by biotic and abiotic factors constrain dissemination of antibiotic resistance elements and assert that a more holistic perception of these factors is crucial for understanding and managing antibiotic resistance dissemination graphical abstract image 1 keywords treated wastewater irrigation antibiotic resistance antibiotic resistance gene horizontal gene transfer 1 introduction antibiotic resistance ar is a natural phenomenon that far outdates the introduction of antibiotics to modern medicine d costa et al 2011 in bacteria antibiotic resistance genes args can be acquired through horizontal or lateral gene transfer hgt davies and davies 2010 of mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids and conjugative transposons and modular genetic elements i e integrons that rely on recombination of mobile gene cassettes cambray et al 2010 martinez et al 2015 van hoek et al 2011 mges can facilitate shuttling of args from environmental non pathogenic bacteria to clinically relevant pathogens and vice versa contributing to the global propagation of antibiotic resistance bondarczuk et al 2016 tripathi and cytryn 2017 several anthropogenic sources have been identified as hotspots for dissemination of args bengtsson palme et al 2018 urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps being one of the most significant berendonk et al 2015 subsequently wwtp effluent derived antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and args especially those harbored on mges are regarded as contaminants of emerging concern cec berendonk et al 2015 pruden et al 2006 therefore microbial communities from wwtps have been intensively investigated in the last decade with multidisciplinary approaches ju et al 2018 marano and cytryn 2017 quantitative pcr qpcr provides a robust solution for evaluating args dissemination across environmental boundaries and it has been extensively applied to evaluate args in wwtps and downstream environments characterized as locations that are situated downstream from the wwtp discharge point nonetheless the a priori choice of args monitored by qpcr is as important as the outcomes of the obtained results and needs to be determined based on the characteristics of the investigated environments well operated wwtps generally reduce arb args loads by 1 2 orders of magnitude yang et al 2014 but effluents can still contain 103 108 args copies per ml that are discharged to downstream environments laht et al 2014 lapara et al 2011 in light of the above the use of treated wastewater tww for irrigation of edible crops raises questions regarding the biological safety of this practice while a few studies showed that irrigation with tww systematically contributes to args dissemination in soil microbial communities han et al 2016 others indicated that dissemination of args into such soils is similar to that observed for soils irrigated with freshwater negreanu et al 2012 orlofsky et al 2016 recycling water for agriculture is vital for maintaining food security in arid and semi arid regions where fresh water availability is limited and we expect this trend will expand in view of increasing water stress due to climate change and growing human populations however given the discrepancies described above more studies need to focus on potential epidemiological ramifications of the practice and specifically those associated with ar for example in israel a broad range of water qualities are used for irrigation based on the specific crops grown i e non edible crops can be irrigated with secondary effluent whereas unlimited irrigation requires high quality tertiary effluent inbar 2007 stabilization reservoirs are often used for storing wwtp effluents prior to irrigation to further enhance water quality and to optimize distribution of irrigation water juanico and shelef 1994 whereas storage reservoirs are often used to collect and store tww the study described here comprehensively assessed the distribution and abundance of selected args in wwtp effluents used for irrigation and evaluated their potential dissemination to soils and crops in commercial fields and controlled systems lysimeters characterized by a diverse range of soil qualities geographic locations and climatic conditions using qpcr six args that are primarily associated with mges and are profuse in wwtp effluents were targeted along with the inti1 gene which is considered a proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection an exhaustive sampling campaign was conducted at various sites in israel between 2016 and 2017 targeting wwtp effluents effluent from stabilization reservoirs irrigation water tww and fresh water fw where available see

established in 2015 consisted of two plots individually irrigated with fw or tww from wwtp6 table 1 the annual irrigation between march and september 2017 was 0 9 m3 per m2 finally six commercial agricultural fields irrigated with effluents of varying water quality from three different wwtps table 1 and supplementary fig 1 were investigated a fourth wwtp was included in this part of the study but its downstream commercial fields irrigated with tww were not investigated wwtp4 table 1 effluents from three of the targeted wwtps were stored in open air reservoirs 1 2 and 12 million m3 maximum water capacity for wwtp4 wwtp2 and wwtp3 respectively prior to irrigation the reservoir in wwtp3 is a stabilization reservoir where secondary effluents are stored for a minimum of 60 days to further reduce organic matter and pathogen loads followed by a final stage of chlorination table 1 supplementary table 1 whereas the other two are conventional storage reservoirs where water is stored for periods spanning a few weeks to more than two months depending on local requirements table 1 a potato field irrigated with fw in gilat israel and with no history of tww irrigation adjacent to it was included in the analyses from this field soil and potatoes were sampled in may 2016 as described below 2 2 water sampling and processing grab samples from the targeted water sources were collected in

et al 2009 all runs were performed using a steponeplus real time pcr system and analyzed with the stepone software v2 3 applied biosystems foster city ca united states the gene copy numbers generated

soil and crops whereas the relative abundance of inti1 and the targeted args was calculated in each dna extract as the ratio between each gene and the 16s rrna copy number μl 1 and was expressed as copies 16s rrna 1 when qpcr copy number outputs were below the limit of quantification loq i e were under 10 copies μl 1 but above the theoretical limit of qpcr three copies per reaction according to bustin et al 2009 they were addressed as detectable but not quantifiable dbnq 2 6 isolation of cefotaxime resistant and total coliforms a recent study described a surveillance approach for evaluating clinically relevant arb in wwtps by targeting total and cefotaxime resistant fecal coliforms marano and fernandes et al unpublished this approach was applied to water samples along a secondary tertiary tww storage reservoir continuum linked to wwtp2 to assess arb dynamics concomitantly to the culture independent args evaluation sampling was conducted in december 2016 january february august

by r packages ggplot2 wickham 2016 in r r core team 2013 and pheatmap kolde 2019 3 results 3 1 bacterial abundance integrons and args in effluents reservoirs and irrigation water bacterial load in the different water samples was estimated by measuring16s rrna gene abundance using qpcr values ranged from 108 to 106 copies ml 1 in secondary effluent from 106 to 105 copies ml 1 following disinfection from 107 to 105 copies ml 1 in stabilization reservoirs and between 106 to 102 copies ml 1 in the analyzed fresh water samples assessment of bacterial load along the wwtp2 continuum supplementary fig 1 revealed that this was reduced in the tertiary treatment by 1 log but remained within the same order of magnitude when comparing the tertiary effluents to the receiving storage reservoir reflecting a rather steady total bacterial load between the two stages this observation was also true for the water stored in the wwtp4 effluent reservoir in contrast bacterial load in the reservoir receiving wwtp3 effluents were reduced by 1 log with respect to the other reservoirs as this water is subjected to chlorination after a two months stabilization period but prior to use supplementary table 1 fig 1 collectively displays the absolute and relative abundance of inti1 and the args in all of the water samples on average inti1 was the most abundant of the analyzed genes whereas bla ctx m 32 was the least abundant for the most part the relative and absolute abundances of the genes that were consistently quantifiable in secondary and tertiary tww samples showed comparable ranges for the same treatment compartments at the different sampling times fig 1 the effects of disinfection on the targeted genes abundance copies ml 1 could be compared only between wwtp2 and wwtp3 where both secondary and tertiary effluents were sampled wwt3 showed a higher reduction of the tested genes 2 logs with respect to 1 log of wwtp2 fig 1 despite the fact that in wwtp2 the secondary effluent is subjected to two disinfection technologies applied in series i e chlorination and uv radiation supplementary table 1 noticeably most of the args and the inti1 relative abundances systematically displayed a 1 log decrease when comparing wwtp effluents to the three downstream reservoirs the bla oxa10 and bla ges β lactamase genes were ubiquitous in all of the secondary and tertiary effluents but were not detected in any of the fw samples suggesting that these genes are good proxies for wwtp source tracking the bla oxa2 gene was also ubiquitous in secondary and tertiary effluents but was not consistently detected in the reservoirs and was detected and quantified in the may fw lysimeter sample suggesting that it might not be solely associated with wastewater genes bla tem and qnrs were detected in fresh water samples and thus they could not be consistently linked to specific water qualities or compartments and therefore may not be optimal for source tracking of args derived from tww in downstream environments bla ctx m 32 displayed a more erratic behavior and was only detected in some of the effluent samples specific attention was given to the absolute and relative abundances of inti1 in the water samples because it was the most profuse of the analyzed genes and is considered a proxy for anthropogenic pollution supplementary fig 2 collectively inti1 abundance was inversely correlated to the level of effluent treatment in the wwtp3 reservoir inti1 values were dbnq in the march 2016 profile but exceeded 103 copies ml 1 in the june 2016 profile evidently depicting the scenario in which this reservoir is filled with rainwater during the winter and with effluent in the summer 3 2 distribution of cefotaxime resistant fecal coliforms along a secondary tertiary reservoir continuum a targeted culture based approach was applied to evaluate the distribution of cefotaxime resistant fecal coliforms along a secondary effluent tertiary effluent reservoir continuum in wwtp2 to complement the culture independent qpcr analyses described above resistance to the third generation cephalosporin cefotaxime in fecal coliforms is often associated with extended spectrum β lactamases and therefore the abundance of the bla oxa bla ges bla tem and bla ctx m 32 β lactamases was plotted together with the cefotaxime resistant fecal coliform ctx r fc abundance fig 2 total and ctx r fc abundance cfus ml 1 and β lactamase genes abundance decreased from influents to effluents supplementary fig 3 and ctx r fcs and most of the targeted β lactamases excluding bla oxa10 were not detected in the reservoir samples fig 1 storage time indicated in table 1 in contrast 16s rrna gene abundance and total coliform abundances respectively were maintained within the same order of magnitude in both tertiary effluents and the reservoir suggesting similar bacterial abundance in both compartments albeit a shift in the bacterial community harboring fewer β lactamases 3 3 distribution of args and inti1 in soil irrigated with treated wastewater overall 45 soil sample types from across israel 12 fw irrigated soils and 32 tww irrigated soils supplementary fig 1 were analyzed during the irrigation season spanning from march to july 2016 and march to september 2017 collectively the 16s rrna gene abundance in the soils ranged between 1 8 109 5 9 108 lysimiters 2 109 1 2 109 experimental orchard and 1 9 109 1 4 109 commercial fields with an overall average of 1 109 copies g 1 in the present study the lowest quantifiable gene copy number per gram of soil i e above limit of quantification loq was 2 104 copies similar to detection levels described by fortunato et al 2018 however the average 109 copies g 1 of 16s rrna in soils implies that if a given target gene is quantifiable only above 2 104 copies in a gram of soil the resolution in copies 16s rrna 1 would be as little as 2 10 5 while inti1 was quantifiable in almost all of the analyzed soils most of the args were below loq the abundance of the targeted args in both soils and crops from commercial fields are detailed in supplementary tables 5 and 6 the abundance of inti1 the two effluent associated β lactamase markers bla oxa10 and bla ges and the environmentally profuse β lactamase bla tem were specifically assessed along irrigation water soil crop continua of the lysimeter orchard and commercial field experiments fig 3 this comparison between the absolute gene copy levels in the irrigating water and the receiving soils crops was made for these genes based on the hypothesis that soils and crops exposed to arg rich water would have higher probability of acquiring them for inti1 an effect related to tww irrigation was particularly clear in the lysimeter soils see below but this inverse correlation between water quality and inti1 gene abundance in soil and crops was not always observed in the field samples suggesting that other factors beyond water quality may dictate inti1 abundance in soil and crops bla oxa10 and bla ges were not detected in soils and crops irrigated with tww with a few exceptions for bla oxa10 detected in the lysimeter systems fig 3 whereas bla tem displayed a rather stochastic distribution in soil crop matrixes special attention was given to inti1 in the lysimeter samples and it was observed that irrigation with tww increased both relative and absolute abundance of this gene in all of the analyzed soil types when compared with the parallel lysimeters irrigated with fresh water fig 4 a and 4b inti1 was always quantifiable in the commercial fields at the beginning of the irrigation season in both soil and crop samples but in the second sampling campaign a general drop in absolute abundance occurred suggesting that soil associated biotic and abiotic parameters may dictate the abundance of inti1 in soil and crops fig 5 for the corn parsley and carrot fields clayey soils a direct correlation was not observed between water quality and inti1 abundance in the irrigated soils and crops in contrast there seemed to be an inverse correlation between water quality and inti1 abundance in irrigated soil in the potato field sandy soil experiments in the experimental orchard absolute and relative inti1 abundance within each site i e between biological triplicates displayed a high standard deviation which hampered the interpretation of the distribution patterns data not shown to overcome high variation associated with clayey soils such as those found in the experimental orchard in the future increasing soil sample sizes and increasing homogenization of soil samples is recommended as previously elaborated by yankson and steck 2009 4 discussion 4 1 distribution and abundance of args in wastewater wwtps are frequently seen as point sources of antibiotic resistance therefore the dissemination of arb and args to soil crops and subsequently to the food chain as a result of irrigation with tww is especially concerning in arid and semi arid regions e g israel spain cyprus and australia where crops are routinely irrigated with tww jiménez and asano 2008 in israel over 80 of municipal tww is used for irrigation kfir et al 2012 while this practice supplies water for a thriving agricultural sector it is not clear if and to what extent it might contribute to dissemination of antibiotic resistance determinants and also opportunistic pathogens in irrigated soil and produce to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that comprehensively evaluated the distribution and relative abundance of potentially mobile antibiotic resistance related genes in a broad range of experimental and commercial fields irrigated with tww of various qualities relative to when available fresh water as expected arg abundance in tww from all sampled wwtps was more copious than in fresh water and disinfection and reservoir storage substantially reduced args and inti1 abundance while the effects of disinfection on arg loads are reported in literature di cesare et al 2016 he et al 2019 jia et al 2015 less is known about the subsequent fate in reservoirs stabilization reservoirs reduce organic matter and pathogen loads in secondary effluents through natural biological processes that occur in the water column this includes further elimination of pathogens such as microbial viral or helminthic which require longer retention times compared to the conventional hydraulic retention time of wwtps and therefore local regulations dictate a minimum of sixty days followed by a chlorination prior to use of water for irrigation while stabilization reservoirs and storage reservoirs are not devised to cope with antibiotic resistance determinants per se this study complements previous studies kfir et al 2012 that demonstrated that their use can serve as a barrier to prevent spreading of certain chemical and biological contaminants to other environments for instance on average a 2 log arg reduction was observed after 60 days of storage and chlorination of secondary effluents from wwtp3 which is more than 1log reduction relative to that of wwtp2 that uses a similar chlorination setup supplementary table 1 in additional to a uv treatment stage fig 1 supplementary fig 1 recently it was shown by he et al 2019 that treatment with uv has lower inactivation capacity towards args compared to chlorination two hypotheses previously proposed by di cesare et al 2016 may explain the strong reduction in args abundance in the analyzed reservoirs on the one hand effluents let to rest in open air reservoirs may undergo a shift towards native aquatic microbial communities that outcompete arb from wwtps this might result from drastic changes in hydraulic parameters or strong shifts in limnological conditions such as diurnal cycles algae blooms competition for resources and predation on the other hand qpcr of dna extracted from samples collected immediately after disinfection might come with the bias of measuring inactivated non viable bacteria in the tertiary effluents as qpcr cannot differentiate between dead and living cells however the culture based analyses described above suggest that this is not the case at least for the reservoir downstream to wwtp2 in the latter case the observed ctx r fc cfus dynamics were consistent across five independent samplings spanning 2016 2017 fig 2 this reinforces the postulation that when possible molecular based and culture based analyses should be applied in tandem to complement each other s limitations manaia et al 2018 collectively this comprehensive analysis of effluent samples from sites across israel demonstrate that args abundance negatively correlates to the level of treatment secondary or tertiary and that effluent stabilization and storage reservoirs potentially constitute ecological barriers that reduce the dissemination of args to crops the authors believe that better understanding and proper management of these reservoirs can enhance this capacity in the future for risk assessment of arg spreading from a point source such as tww to a given receiving environment such as soil application of qpcr is only useful if it targets genes that are profuse in the source but are not abundant in the receiving environments berendonk et al 2015 gatica et al 2016 furthermore when evaluating the potential public health risks associated with dissemination of args from wastewater to receiving environments it is equally important to target genes encoding resistance to clinically important antibiotics that are associated with mobile genetic elements due to their capacity to be horizontally transferred to indigenous microbes therefore inti1 a well established proxy for anthropogenic pollution and four args that are frequently associated with plasmids and other conjugative elements were targeted of all the args bla oxa2 bla ges and especially bla oxa10 were highly prevalent in secondary effluents generally persistent in tww and almost completely absent with one exception in the analyzed fw samples these three β lactamases were previously found to be abundant and strongly associated with integrons in wwtp effluents evans and amyes 2014 gatica et al 2016 and therefore with this study they especially bla oxa10 are proposed as highly suitable candidates for source tracking of args derived from wwtps in the future furthermore bla oxa2 and bla oxa10 were previously reported to be linked to hospital sewage effluents by simo tchuinte et al 2016 which highlight both the clinical relevance of these genes and their presumptive point source a wide array of clinically relevant gene families were previously found to be strongly linked to tww gatica et al 2016 rahube et al 2014 however it is important to underline that several of these including tetracycline and aminoglicoside resistance genes were also reported to be present in soil microbial communities not exposed to tww han et al 2016 thereby not entirely fulfilling the requirements described above by berendonk et al 2015 for optimal source tracking we chose to focus primarily on β lactamases because this family is ubiquitous in clinically associated pathogens and the bla ges bla oxa2 and bla oxa10 genes were previously found to be strongly linked to tww used for irrigation but were absent in non irrigated soil gatica et al 2016 rahube et al 2014 4 2 dissemination of tww derived args in soil collectively our data from both the controlled lysimeters and the field experiments revealed low abundance of the surveyed args in all the tested soils following irrigation with tww and a complete lack of correlation between args abundance in irrigation water and that detected in the corresponding irrigated soils and crops for example in the wwtp1 june profile despite the fact that the low quality tww used for irrigation contained approximately 7 106 copies ml 1 of bla oxa10 the abundance of this gene was below detection limits in the corresponding irrigated soil and corn leaves used for animal feed albeit the fact that leaves that were close to the ground were intentionally surveyed this worst case scenario validates previously documented studies gatica et al 2015 2016 suggesting that soil constitutes a robust ecological barrier that hinders the dissemination of antibiotic resistance at least for certain args while bla tem was detected in several of the analyzed soils and crops these were clearly not be linked to irrigation with tww as the abundance in samples irrigated with fresh water was often higher than those irrigated with tww a similar observation was reported in a recent study by cerqueira et al 2019 who assessed arg dynamics in soils irrigated with tww in spain when deliberating on the potential dissemination of args across distinct ecosystems i e effluent to reservoir or effluent to soil and crops it is important to consider i the persistence of effluent derived arb in the receiving environments and ii the capacity of individual args to be horizontally transferred from effluent arb to native bacteria from soil and crops klumper et al 2015 regarding i our data strongly suggest that effluent derived arb generally do not persist in soils and crops irrigated with tww this is strongly supported by previous studies conducted in our lab gatica et al 2016 gatica and cytryn 2013 negreanu et al 2012 and by a recent study that found no difference in the abundance of several fecal bacterial indicators in soil and tomatoes that were drip irrigated in tandem with tww and fresh water despite significant differences in bacterial abundance in the two water sources orlofsky et al 2016 the authors conclude that a myriad of abiotic and biotic parameters and their interactions should be considered when evaluating the fate of args in soil and crops all beyond the quality of the tww alone these may include exposure to intense sunlight temperatures plant immune responses competing microbes and predation just to mention a few indeed the majority of soil and crop samples analyzed after several months of irrigation with tww had lower args abundance than in the early season samples despite having higher args loads in the irrigation water it is here speculated that this is attributed to higher temperature desiccation stress and radiation intensities furthermore args may also be introduced to soils and crops by sources of contamination other than irrigation water such as insects birds and rodents acting as vectors or through fecal deposition arnold et al 2016 zurek and ghosh 2014 regarding ii while hgt of args between effluent associated and soil microbiomes may occur the fact that higher arg abundances were not observed in soils irrigated with tww suggests that it either happens at extremely low frequencies or that transformation events do occur but acquired genes are rapidly lost because fitness costs of args acquisition exceed their benefits bengtsson palme et al 2018 despite our optimistic conclusions regarding the low risks of antibiotic resistance dissemination in fields irrigated with tww it is important to consider that only a limited number of args were analyzed in this study mostly β lactamase resistance genes and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that other genes may proliferate through persistence of specific effluent derived bacterial populations or through horizontal transfer of mobile elements when exposed to selective pressure forces alternatively antibiotic residuals in tww may exert selective pressure resulting in proliferation of native soil bacteria that harbor args or alternatively that acquire effluent derived args for instance a recent similar study from pan and chu 2018 showed increased args levels in soil as a consequence of irrigation with tww which were positively correlated to sulfamethazine concentrations in the tww another study by cerqueira et al 2019 found increased levels of tetm meca and bla oxa 58 in soils irrigated with tww however the authors did not test the levels of these args in the irrigating tww and soils irrigated with groundwater control were amended with manure and therefore it is not possible to determine the proportion of args detected in the treated wastewater irrigated soils that originated in the treated wastewater 4 3 class 1 integron dynamics in tww irrigated soil the class 1 integron integrase inti1 gene is often monitored along with args in surveillance studies applied to wwtps and downstream environments due to the clinical implications indicating that class 1 integrons of anthropogenic origin often harbor args and thus play a role in antibiotic resistance dissemination burch et al 2017 gatica et al 2016 gillings 2017 enrichment of inti1 in anthropogenically impacted soils has been previously reported in the literature but these were mostly linked to manure application byrne bailey et al 2011 graham et al 2016 in contrast to the targeted args where concentrations in tww did not correspond to concentrations in irrigated soils and crops the results for inti1 were conflicting positive correlations were detected between inti1 abundance in irrigation water and those in all of the lysimeter soils and the same was true for sandy soils analyzed in the wwtp2 region however this trend was not observed in soils and crops in the other regions where soils were generally heavier richer in clay content this latter observation is supported by similar studies cerqueira et al 2019 han et al 2016 jechalke et al 2015 that showed no observable influence of irrigation with tww on inti1 abundance in irrigated soils when considering the elevated inti1 abundance in the soils irrigated with tww in the case of the lysimeters and sandy field experiments three possible scenarios can be considered i persistence of effluent derived class 1 integron harboring bacteria ii horizontal transfer of extracellular effluent derived plasmids or other conjugative elements that harbor integrons to soil bacteria or iii a shift in the native soil microbiome towards a community enriched in bacteria harboring class 1 integrons the third scenario represents an alternative to the simplistic conception of inti1 as a effluent derived cec that accumulates in soils irrigated with tww it is here hypothesized that this scenario may be facilitated by increased organic carbon and nitrogen inputs from the tww organic carbon was indeed previously described as an important factor shaping microbial communities and antibiotic resistance drenovsky et al 2004 judd et al 2006 wan et al 2019 and organic enrichment was documented in two recent studies exploiting the same lysimeter system ben mordechay et al 2018 zolti et al 2019 this hypothesis is supported by the fact that bla oxa2 bla oxa10 and bla ges abundance did not increase in any of the soils irrigated with tww these three genes have previously been shown to be strongly associated with integrons in general and specifically with class 1 integrons in wastewater effluents evans and amyes 2014 gatica et al 2016 similar to the results described here gatica et al 2016 found insignificant enrichment of these args related to integrons in the upper layer of a soil exposed to secondary effluent as part of a soil aquifer treatment system when compared to adjacent soil that was not exposed to effluents unfortunately the qpcr approach applied here doesn t shed light on gene cassettes harbored by class 1 integrons or the specific phylogenetic groups that harbor class 1 integrons and therefore it cannot specifically be concluded which of the three scenarios described above best explains the increased inti1 abundance in soils irrigated with tww the authors believe that application of additional methodologies such as epic pcr and long read sequencing technologies spencer et al 2016 xia et al 2017 will help to elucidate this question collectively this study underlines that fact that the current axiom of monitoring inti1 as a proxy of anthropogenic pollution may be over simplistic and that future studies need to address the specific composition of gene cassettes harbored on class 1 integrons and the background abundance that are found in native soils 5 conclusions this study strongly suggests that dissemination of args from wastewater effluents to irrigated ecosystems is strongly limited and it highlights the fact that persistence or horizontal transfer of effluent derived args to irrigated soils and crops most likely depends on a myriad of biotic and abiotic parameters that may significantly hamper these processes from occurring in spite of the assemblage of tracked genes covering a narrow spectrum of gene families we specifically targeted args found to be abundant in tww and sparse in fresh water and background soils and demonstrated that there was no evidence of persistence of these genes in tww irrigated soils even when concentrations in tww were high the study also demonstrates that dissemination of args from anthropogenic sources to the environment cannot be projected by simplistic cause and effect scenarios but instead need to be investigating within the framework of comprehensive ecological models that integrate a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors these models need to integrate multivariate parameters such as irrigation duration soil type climate microbial diversity of the soil etc future studies should also focus on identifying rare and unpreventable hgt events that may locally reshape the resistome of soil microbial communities that cannot be identified using standard qpcr analyses because these events may have long term environmental and clinical relevance

18541,fluvial networks are globally relevant for the processing of dissolved organic matter dom to investigate the change in molecular dom diversity along the river course high field fticr mass spectrometry and nmr spectroscopy of riverine dom as well as bacterial abundance and activity were measured in a third order stream along a land use gradient from pristine agricultural to urban landscapes dom composition showed a clear evolution along the river course with an initial decrease of average oxidation and unsaturation followed by an increased relative abundance of chno and chos compounds introduced by agriculture and waste water respectively dom composition was dominated by rather unsaturated cho compounds h c 1 in headwaters and by more aliphatic molecules at downstream sites oxygenated functional groups shifted from aromatic ethers and hydroxyl groups to aliphatic carboxylic acids and aliphatic hydroxyl groups this massive dislocation of oxygen significantly increased the diversity of atomic environments in branched aliphatic groups from headwater to downstream dom mass spectra of dom enabled the detection of compositional relationships to bacterial abundance and activity which was positively related to more aliphatic components h c 1 and negatively related to unsaturated components fticr mass and nmr spectra corroborated the initial decline in dom molecular diversity predicted by the river continuum concept rcc but demonstrated an anthropogenic increase in the molecular diversity of dom further downstream while the high dom molecular diversity in first order headwater streams was the result of small scale ecosystem plurality agriculture and waste water treatment introduced many components in the lower reaches these anthropogenic influences together with massive bacterial oxidation of dom contributed to a growth of molecular diversity of downstream dom whose composition and structure differed entirely from those found in pristine headwaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords dom fticr ms nmr stream wwtp bacterial production biofilm 1 introduction streams and rivers are important sites for organic carbon processing they receive considerable amounts of terrestrial organic matter aufdenkampe et al 2011 of which a large proportion is humic like aromatic rich material dominated by lignin and tannin compounds mosher et al 2015 along the river course from mountain springs and headwaters to the lowlands algal photosynthesis contributes to increasing proportions of autochthonous dom jaffe et al 2012 parr et al 2015 the river continuum concept predicts a high molecular diversity of dom in first order streams with high proportions of groundwater dom and decreasing diversity in second order to fifth order streams vannote et al 1980 on the other hand rivers receive molecules from anthropogenic sources such as agriculture industry and waste water treatment hosen et al 2014 parr et al 2015 contributing to the overall molecular diversity of dom thus it is very likely that the molecular diversity of riverine dom will evolve along the river course and might in fact increase from the source to the confluence with higher order streams dom quality and its changes in streams are commonly assessed using fluorescence spectra cory and kaplan 2012 hosen et al 2014 parr et al 2015 several indices relating specific excitation and emission wavelengths were developed e g an increased freshness index fellmann et al 2010 indicates more microbially produced dom and a decreased humification index zsolnay 2003 indicates less plant derived dom due to farming which increased also dissolved organic nitrogen concentration graeber et al 2015 in urban streams the proportion of humic like allochthonous dom was lower whereas the more bioavailable autochthonous dom showed higher proportions parr et al 2015 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms detects gas phase ions of molecules with very high molecular resolution enabling the assignment of thousands of cho chno chos and chnos molecular formulas hertkorn et al 2008 however it is subject to ionization selectivity and many isomeric molecules may project on any individual mass peak nmr spectroscopy allows the analysis and quantification of carbon and hydrogen based aliphatic oxygenated and aromatic chemical environments of atoms together fticr and nmr mass spectra provide complementary information about structure and molecular composition of dom hertkorn et al 2007 while in recent years several mass spectrometry based studies of riverine dom were performed at single sites of one or more streams kim et al 2006 stubbins et al 2010 sleighter et al 2014 wagner et al 2015 only a single study mosher et al 2015 covered a longitudinal transect from headwater streams proceeding downstream to the best of our knowledge no nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr analysis covers evolution of riverine dom along the river course biological processing of dom in streams and rivers is mainly performed by heterotrophic bacteria and leads to breakdown of large molecule and ultimate co2 emissions from running waters while other fractions of dom might flocculate and become part of sedimentary carbon or are exported to the ocean cole et al 2007 battin et al 2008 hale and godsey 2019 this processing can be performed by planktonic suspended stream water bacteria or by epilithic bacteria associated in biofilms battin et al 2003 2008 previous studies have shown that the activity of planktonic bacteria was related to dom quality while activity of biofilm bacteria was not due to benthic algae and extracellular polymeric substances as additional carbon sources in biofilms kamjunke et al 2015 however bacterial activity was only related to bulk optical parameters and could not be related to specific carbon species so far here we tested the hypotheses that 1 dom diversity decreases along the river course and 2 bacterial abundance and activity are related to specific dom components this research requires a highly resolved molecular dom characterization not commonly available in this contribution we related fticr ms and nmr based better constrained molecular composition and structure of riverine dom to biological processing along a representative german third order stream with a land use

wollschläger et al 2017 the holtemme river is a third order river in the elbe catchment area with a long term mean annual discharge of 1 34 m3 s 1 gauging station mahndorf that originates at 862 m a s l and flows into the bode river the land use in the catchment is dominated by agriculture 60 followed by forests 30 and urban 10 areas wollschläger et al 2017 the hydromorphology is natural in the upstream sections but highly impacted due to channeling riparian clearcutting and incision in urban and agricultural areas the river receives substantial pollution from two wastewater treatment facilities serving a population equivalent of more than 40 000 each and from tributaries draining agricultural areas sampling of dom quality and bacteria was performed at 12 sites from headwater to

obtained from intensity normalized mass spectra osterholz et al 2016 kamjunke et al 2017 this procedure was applied to each of the 12 samples and was used to evaluate longitudinal dom quality changes we applied a linear regression between the relative mass peak intensity as dependent variable and the distance of the sampling sites from the source where the slope was regarded as semi quantitative parameter for the change a positive negative slope basically means an increase decrease of the component abundance along the flow length for visualization in van krevelen diagrams we used only

sources i e which were not present in all samples we performed spearman correlations for linked equal values sachs 1974 with the intersample ranked intensities herzsprung et al 2012 which were present in at least 7 samples and with p 0 05 r2 0 332 3 results 3 1 bulk parameter analysis discharge increased continuously from the source to site 6 which might be explained by the inflow of several tributaries and the effluent of the first wwtp fig 2 further downstream discharge remained nearly constant with low contributions of tributaries doc concentrations were highest in the headwater section and decreased from site 1 to site 4 partly due to dilution by tributaries with lower doc concentration from there the doc was nearly constant at a level of about 3 mg l 1 fluorescence and freshness index increased slightly until site 4 showed a steep increase in response to the first wwtp and remained constant afterwards humification index and specific uv absorption decreased until site 5 and did not change further downstream fticr mass spectra showed clear changes along its river course spe dom from sites 1 and 2 showed skewed near gaussian type distributions of mass peaks with a steeper slope toward lower mass m z 350 than toward higher mass m z 450 fig s1 overall mass peak distributions became more symmetrical downstream from site 3 downstream various groups of sharp mass peaks indicated restricted sets of abundant molecules at sites 4 and 5 patterning indicated presence of either abundant biomolecules from dom processing or anthropogenic compounds from site 7 downwards a distinct group of low mass peaks m z 300 appeared the average h c ratio indicated a transition from more unsaturated sites 1 3 toward more saturated aliphatic molecules at sites 4 12 whereas the o c ratio decreased from sites 2 5 the o c ratio slightly increases from site 5 7 and decreased in response to the second wwtp again where h c increased in parallel fig 2 the average oxidation state of carbon osc as well as the average mass continually declined from site 2 until sample 5 after wwtp 1 and showed similar behaviour as the o c ratio 3 2 classification and inter sample ranking the hierarchical cluster analysis hca computed from ftms derived molecular compositions which were present at all 12 sites fig s1b showed that the dom quality in the headwater up to site 3 was completely different from the dom quality in the lower course sites 4 7 were rather similar among themselves with sites 4 5 and 6 7 most likewise whereas sites 8 12 were even more alike with site 9 slightly dissimilar the inter sample rankings analysis projected on van krevelen diagrams revealed more specific differences in dom quality fig 3 the headwater sites 1 3 showed mainly 1st to 4th ranks for o rich polyphenol like and highly unsaturated o rich h c 1 components van krevelen coordinates shown in fig s4 according to rossel et al 2017 in the following combined and named as o rich dbe richcomp herzsprung et al 2012 and 9th to 12th ranks for more aliphatic and oxygen poor components o c 0 5 and h c 1 and some oxygen rich components with h c 1 the samples from sites 4 7 showed middle ranks for o rich dbe richcomp 3rd to 8th whereas the downstream sites 8 12 showed 7th to 12th ranks for these components overall higher ranks shifted from o rich dbe richcomp toward higher aliphaticity h c ratio and less oxygenation o c ratio along the river course of holtemme 3 3 analysis of the slope of fticr mass peak intensities along the holtemme river course the evolution of molecular compositions along the river course was deduced from changes in relative mass peak intensity versus distance from holtemme origin an example plot fig s5a covers five representative molecular compositions three cho and one chos chno molecules each the slopes were visualized according to cho chno and chos compounds fig 4a the relative intensity of o rich dbe richcomp decreased considerably fig 4a section b along the holtemme river whereas compounds of near average unsaturation and oxygenation increased in relative abundance fig 4a section a chno of overall smaller chemodiversity than cho compounds 0 8 h c 1 3 0 4 o c 0 7 near continually increased along the holtemme river fig 4a section c while the majority of chos components showed higher extent of oxygenation but near identical relative unsaturation 1 h c 1 7 0 4 o c 0 8 than respective cho compounds fig 4a section e three characteristic ch2 based homologous series of chos components strongly increased downstream fig 4a section d table s6 the distinct evolution of dom molecular compositions downstream was visualized by recognizing only molecular compositions which first appeared at the specific sampling points 2 11 any composition in site 1 is new by definition and then remained abundant in all consecutive sampling points downstream fig 4b the presence of new components mainly chos was first observed at site 5 as response to wwtp1 at site 6 the highest number of new components was detected the 153 components which were absent in samples 1 5 and present in samples 6 12 are shown in an additional van krevelen diagram insert a suite of chno compounds showed considerable oxygenation and unsaturation in the last downstream sample from site 12 the many new appearing components represent an inevitable artefact of the last sampling point analogous low intensity components are exclusively observed in any sample but not present in other samples riedel and dittmar 2014 components with the lowest percentage intensity values are not far from signal to noise ratio components present in all samples had the highest intensities whereas components present in only one sample had comparably low intensities table s7 the overall count of molecular compositions uniformly declined from site 1 reaching a minimum count at site 4 to grow again to site 6 to then stay nearly constant fig 4c the proportions of molecular series also changed the relative abundance of cho compounds declined nearly continually from source to outflow whereas the relative proportion of non oxygen heteroatom containing molecules grew in the order chnos chno chos compounds with a decisive onset from site 4 fig s2 while the average c n ratio levelled off from site 6 the c s ratio more gradually declined along the river course table s5 with recognition of the sharp increase in abundance of chno chos and chnos compounds from site 6 downstream fig 4c another hca was computed based solely on these molecular compositions which were present in all samples from site 6 to site 12 fig s3 here samples from sites 6 and 7 were quite similar while all remaining samples 8 12 clustered distinctly the attendant van krevelen diagram showed that these compounds were of average oxygenation and fairly unsaturated the relative unsaturation as expressed by the average h c ratio and the overall chemodiversity declined in the order chos chno chnos components group specific results showed a decrease of o rich dbe richcomp from sample 1 5 fig 5 a the group highly unsaturated o poor components and the group highly unsaturated o rich 1 h c 1 5 both increased from sample 1 4 the first one increased further to sample 5 but the latter one decreased from sample 4 5 regarding chos components all components with steep increases along the lines d1 d2 and d3 in fig 4a were not detectable between sites 1 4 they increased steeply after the first wwtp decreased at sites 6 and 7 except for c17h26o5s and showed a strong increase again downstream the second wwtp chno and chnos showed mainly different behaviour to the d1 d2 and d3 chos fig s6 3 4 1h nmr spectra all 1h nmr spectra of holtemme spe dom from sites 1 12 showed broad superimposed nmr resonances typical of a fairly processed riverine organic matter however groups of relatively sharp aliphatic and aromatic nmr resonances indicative of rather early stages of dom processing were more abundant in the upstream region all spe dom featured a high aliphaticity with a substantial proportion of open chain aliphatic carboxylic acids cf below the evolution of the 1h nmr section integrals along the river course appeared inconspicuous table s7 a rather marginal decline of purely aliphatic units ccc h was compensated to a minor extent by an increased abundance of functionalized aliphatics occ h while oxygenated aliphatic units oc h remained nearly constant fig s9 table s9 hca and pca resulted in a clear distinction of sites from sites 1 and 2 against all other samples fig s10 while the further evolution of dom along the river course was not governed by a straight process the distinction of spe dom 1 probably reflected genuine contributions from natural input of phenolic and lignin rich materials from a pristine forest environment which also caused an elaborate and abundant array of och3 groups table s9 fig s11a fig s12 spe dom 2 was dominated by a uniquely abundant and rather specific lipid like component resonating at the positions δh 0 90 1 24 1 35 1 55 1 63 2 03 and 2 17 ppm which showed resolved j couplings this is indicative that these distinct nmr features arose from only a few compounds these abundant lipid like components relatively attenuated the amplitude of all other background nmr resonances typical for natural organic matter which reflected a higher diversity of directly oc h and remotely ocn h n 2 oxygenated aliphatic branching motifs in general a direct comparison of spe dom from sites 1 and 2 fig s12 demonstrated that apart from the unique set of lipid like compounds the section of common nom molecules was far less oxygenated at site 2 than at site 1 while still showing an appreciable diversity of aliphatic branching motifs hertkorn et al 2015 values of 1h nmr section integrals with 0 01 ppm resolution were related to the river distance of the 12 sites see fig s5b for five examples resulting in a slope over the river stretch for each integral a comparison of area normalized 1h nmr spectra at full resolution revealed significant trends of dom structure chemical evolution along the river course which were not available from 1h nmr section integrals fig 6 in summary open chain aliphatics of a limited structural diversity which comprised mainly variants of hooc chα chβ chγ chδ ch3 units produced groups of relatively sharp nmr resonances which were more abundant in the headwaters than downstream these hugely superimposed nmr resonances were caused by a mixture of many open chain branched aliphatic carboxylic acids and resonated at rather specific positions δh chα 2 1 2 4 ppm δh chβ 1 6 ppm δh chγ 1 35 ppm δh chδ ε 1 3 ppm δh ch3 0 89 ppm hertkorn et al 2015 these prominent nmr resonances became gradually attenuated while broad nmr resonances ranging from δh 0 9 2 8 ppm and 3 4 4 3 ppm near continually grew in abundance when proceeding downstream from source to mouth fig 6c figs s11a and b these broad nmr resonances represented an enormous diversity of aliphatic compounds with alicyclic rings meckenstock et al 2014 and remote oxygen substitution ocn h n 2 at δh 0 9 2 0 ppm figs s11a and b hooc c h α units characteristic of carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram hertkorn et al 2006 and other carboxylic acids at δh 2 2 2 8 ppm and oxygenated aliphatic units oc h at δh 3 3 4 8 ppm figs s11a and b 3 5 bacterial abundance and production and their correlation to dom quality the abundance of planktonic bacteria started with low values in headwaters showed a first increase between sites 4 5 and a larger increase between sites 7 8 fig 7 planktonic bp was lowest in the headwaters of holtemme sites 1 and 2 and increased at sites 3 5 and 9 the cell specific bp was highest at site 3 and decreased downstream the longitudinal variability of biofilm bacterial abundance was lower than that of planktonic bacteria with a maximum value at site 5 the longitudinal dynamics of biofilm bp and cell specific biofilm bp was not very pronounced the assimilable organic carbon ranged from 0 02 to 0 2 mg c l 1 and showed particularly high values at sites 5 and 10 abundance and bp of planktonic bacteria were positively related to fluorescence and freshness index of dom and negatively to humification index and suva whereas no relationships were found for cell specific bp table s10 biofilm abundance and bp as well as aoc did not correlate to dom fluorescence planktonic abundance showed very strong positive correlations to fticr ms components with low o c and high h c ratios and very strong negative correlations to components with high o c and low h c ratios fig 8 planktonic bp was less strongly related to these groups and cell specific bp showed only few significant correlations fig s15 biofilm abundance and bp showed few specific positive relationships to components with h c 1 and different o c and negative ones to components with h c 1 and o c 0 5 the aoc was negatively related to very few components the spearman correlations considering components present at at least 7 sites were also strongest for planktonic abundance and bp for cho chno and particularly chos components whereas correlations to biofilm bp were moderate and to biofilm abundance and aoc were weaker figs s14a c parameters of bacterial abundance and activity were also correlated to section integrals of 1h nmr spectra fig 9 planktonic abundance and bp were mainly positively related particularly at δh 1 0 5 0 ppm and δh 6 5 9 0 ppm biofilm abundance and bp showed positive rank correlation coefficients at δh 1 0 2 8 ppm and δh 6 5 8 0 ppm in contrast aoc showed mainly negative rank correlation coefficients 4 discussion 4 1 insights in dom dynamics from bulk optical parameters and elemental composition several studies investigated the effect of agricultural land use on dom quality in rivers by measuring its optical properties usually the humification index hix as a measure of terrestrial dom decreased and the freshness index β α as a measure of autochthonous dom increased with an increase of agriculture in the catchment graeber et al 2015 as a consequence of changing dom quality the partial pressure of co2 in water was higher in agricultural streams compared to forest streams it was negatively correlated to molecular size and allochthonous dom kamjunke et al 2013 bodmer et al 2016 in the holtemme river doc concentration was highest in the headwaters and remained rather constant after an initial decrease the humification index decreased by a factor of three from forest to agricultural catchments whereas the freshness index doubled along that reach which is typical in streams e g williams et al 2010 kamjunke et al 2015 ejarque et al 2017 joint analyses using structural and optical properties of dom in combination were recently applied to investigate dom quality with molecular resolution lavonen et al 2015 hertkorn et al 2016 herzsprung et al 2017 and we also correlated fluorescence indices and fticr ms results for the holtemme e g positive correlation between o rich dbe richcomp and hix and suva fig s8 we observed o rich dbe richcomp fig 3 with high molecular weight table s4 in headwaters of the holtemme which were found also for soil organic matter at forested sites seifert et al 2016 the relative abundances of o rich dbe richcomp decreased downstream in the holtemme the high upstream concentrations which are confirmed by high hix values might be explained by the large proportion of forests and wetlands in the upper catchment which are usually a source of such highly oxygen rich and aromatic components the decrease of o rich dbe richcomp concentrations downstream had four potential causes photodegradation stubbins et al 2010 riedel et al 2016 dilution precipitation with iron minerals dadi et al 2017 and mixing with a tributary containing different dom quality biodegradation of o rich dbe richcomp is less important in these fast flowing cold headwaters as these components are assumed to be relatively recalcitrant in the dark riedel et al 2016 whereas dilution play a role in the upstream part of holtemme fig 2 4 2 process analyses by combination of structural information and elemental composition 1h nmr spectra demonstrated that the main structural changes of spe dom from source to mouth comprised a very significant oxidation of riverine spe dom which referred to an increasing abundance of both direct oxygenation products oc h units and even more significant carboxylation r c h n cooh units the introduction of oxygen imposes remote substituent effects on δh up to four bonds away the superposition of much more numerous different aliphatic chemical environments in the downstream reaches eventually produced even more continual broad nmr resonance envelopes at the expense of intense nmr resonances originating from oxygen depleted simple aliphatic branching motifs fig 6c broad nmr resonances poor in distinct features are characteristic of a highly processed organic matter like those found in downstream spe dom the diversification of aliphatic components along the river stretch corresponded well with the increased abundance of rather aliphatic components with high h c and low o c ratios observed by fticr ms the slight decrease of aromatic components indicated by nmr was in accordance with the decrease of o rich dbe richcomp with low h c and high o c shown by fticr ms stoichiometry of dom was shown to alter with changing land use gücker et al 2016 holtemme river showed higher proportions of chno chos and chnos compounds in urbanized and agricultural areas compared to forest catchments fig s2 in line with previous results wagner et al 2015 the observed increase in relative abundance of single chos compounds and the group chos1 o poor downstream the wwtp fig 5 fig s6 corresponds to highly abundant chos compounds found in effluent organic matter by gonsior et al 2011 the chos derived mass peaks with highest abundances in effluent organic matter could be attributed to anthropogenic surfactants such as linear alkyl benzene sulfonates their co products dialkyl tetralin sulfonates and their biodegraded metabolites such as sulfophenyl carboxylic acids gonsior et al 2011 wang et al 2018 as an example the component c14h20o5s is potentially a sulphenyl carboxylic acid and c15h20o5s a dialkyl tetralin sulfonate intermediate gonsior et al 2011 the molecular complexity can be increased in effluent organic matter tseng et al 2013 in contrast to the chos the increase of chno compounds fig 4 fig s6 and the appearance of some chno compounds at site 6 fig 4b in holtemme river can be explained by diffuse sources from agriculture this was confirmed the increase of chn1o and chn2o group between samples 5 and 6 fig s6 chno were also reported to originate from effluent organic matter mesfioui et al 2012 several chno components increased after both wwtps e g c14h17n1o8 fig s6 however wwtps seemed to be a minor source for chno compared to agriculture as sampling was performed under base flow conditions when the relative contribution of point sources is expected to be high compared to diffuse sources the importance of agricultural chno import into the holtemme river should be even higher at high discharge 4 3 dom diversity natural decline versus increase by human activity and microbial oxygenation the river continuum concept rcc vannote et al 1980 proposed maximum molecular diversity of dom in headwaters and a continual decrease of dom molecular diversity downstream vannote et al 1980 fragmentation of ecosystems in mountainous headwater streams contributes to differences in dom formation conditions on very small spatial scales leading to increased molecular diversity mosher et al 2015 lynch et al 2019 whereas larger water bodies such as higher order streams are subject to mixing attenuation of gradients and equilibration of dom formation conditions this predicted pattern was confirmed by the results in the upper part of holtemme river dom diversity based on fticr mass spectrometry showed the highest number of compositions at site 1 n 2396 and remarkably declined toward site 4 n 969 fig 4c nmr spectra demonstrated dominance of certain aliphatic branching motifs in the headwaters of holtemme river fig 6c this does not necessarily imply the presence of a restricted count of diverse molecules but it means that the majority of these molecules share a certain set of oxygen deficient aliphatic branching motifs hertkorn et al 2015 nom is commonly more oxygenated than biological metabolites and it carries significantly higher proportions of quaternary carbon atoms lam et al 2007 headwater dom features mainly forest derived organic matter which primarily consists of lignin and tannin derived biogeochemical organic molecules of decent oxygenation and often lipid derived common biomolecules which are highly aliphatic with a low average degree of oxygenation therefore initially produced dom shows an intermediate degree of unsaturation and a relative depletion of heteroatoms however the number of components increased again toward site 7 n 2543 and stayed nearly constant further downstream table s4 in stream algal derived primary production initially generates primarily aliphatic and rather oxygen deficient lipid derived metabolites apart from fast cycling carbohydrates which are poorly retained by spe and also do not ionize well in negative esi however continual breakdown of larger size molecules and aggregates is accompanied by progressive bacterial oxidation of riverine doc and poc here oxygen is introduced on a massive scale to produce carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram hertkorn et al 2006 lam et al 2007 materials derived from linear terpenoids mdlt lam et al 2007 arakawa et al 2017 and many other oxidation products with an overall higher compositional and structural diversity than found in the starting materials in holtemme river human activities like agriculture and wwtp probably have contributed to introduction of chno chos and chnos compounds into riverine dom fig 4b table s4 some of it also through groundwater input graham et al 2018 in the most downsteam reaches of holtemme it becomes progressively more difficult to determine changes in the composition by fticr ms and structure by nmr of riverine dom evolved dom is subject to a myriad of biochemical transformations which nevertheless are dominated by a very few nominal transformations moritz et al 2017 such as e g hydroxylation o methylation ch2 de hydration h2o glycosylation c6h12o6 de acetylation c2h2o and carboxylation co2 which are imposed on already pre existing dom molecules with an appreciable coverage of the compositional space already in place hertkorn et al 2008 the vast majority of these reactions will project on compositions already present in the mixture fig s13 4 4 compound specific links to bacterial activity low values of planktonic bp were observed in the headwater sections at high doc concentrations since the dom was dominated by o rich dbe richcomp the quality of the dom was obviously more important than its concentration which had also been reported by shi et al 2016 the planktonic bp was enhanced with rising nitrate concentration site 3 and it further increased downstream of the two wwtps from site 4 to 5 and from site 7 to 8 planktonic abundance and bp were particularly correlated to oxygen poor chos components released by the wwtps fig s14c in maine us decreased proportions of humic like allochthonous dom and increased abundance of bioavailable autochthonous doc amounts in urbanized streams doubled the doc decay rate and increased the activity of carbon acquiring enzymes parr et al 2015 in headwaters microbial bioavailability of dom was greater in urbanized streams with decreasing proportions of humic like dom and increasing proportions of protein like dom hosen et al 2014 in contrast the long term bacterial growth did not mirror the longitudinal dynamics of bp in our study it was high at wwtp a at site 5 but not at wwtp b followed by a subsequent decrease and downstream a weir site 10 where the stagnant water might have changed bacterial community composition usually effluents of wwtps increase the number of live bacteria extracellular enzyme activity perujo et al 2016 leucine aminopeptidase activity and respiration aristi et al 2015 compared to the upstream sites planktonic bp increased with decreasing hix and increasing β α as already observed for the whole bode catchment kamjunke et al 2015 lower hix and higher β α values had suggested an enhanced bp in agricultural streams previously williams et al 2010 this could be corroborated by many negatively correlated fticr ms components with planktonic bp of those many were o rich dbe richcomp which are shown to positively correlate with the hix fig s6 as confirmed by literature lavonen et al 2015 herzsprung et al 2017 the positive correlation of planktonic bp to β α can be explained by many positively correlated components with more aliphatic character h c 1 for most of them negative correlation may either mean that the component was more consumed if bp was high or that bp was inhibited simple correlations alone would not enable distinction of these two types of dom processing biofilm bp showed less variability compared to planktonic bp and was not related to bulk dom characteristics such as hix and β α as described before kamjunke et al 2015 with the recognition of fticr ms derived molecular compositions only few correlations were found for biofilms which was true also for long term bacterial growth the mainly positive slopes of nmr intensities over the river stretch in the range δh 1 5 ppm fig 6c coincided with mainly positive correlations between the respective nmr section integrals and planktonic and biofilm bp fig 9 this indicates that the increase of nmr components was positively related to bp the increase of nmr slopes in downstream direction between δh 7 8 ppm positively correlated with planktonic and biofilm bp indicating a microbial production of aromatic carboxylic acids 5 conclusion while the massive dislocation of oxygen observed in dom along the river course of river holtemme probably occurred from natural causes operating in pristine rivers sizable proportions of chos chno and chnos compounds were introduced in downstream reaches by anthropogenic activities the decrease of dom diversity in the upper part of holtemme hypothesis 1 was predicted by the river continuum concept rcc and reflected the transition from fragmented ecosystems in holtemme headwaters with a high diversity of dom formation conditions to a larger water body with attenuated gradients extensive mixing and more uniform conditions the influence of the wwtps was apparent by an increase of the freshness index decreasing oxidation state of carbon and an increase of several chos components mass spectrometry and nmr spectroscopy of dom along the holtemme river course revealed relationships between dom composition and bacterial activity which were not available from fluorescence indices hypothesis 2 further research should clarify the relative contributions of pristine in river

18541,fluvial networks are globally relevant for the processing of dissolved organic matter dom to investigate the change in molecular dom diversity along the river course high field fticr mass spectrometry and nmr spectroscopy of riverine dom as well as bacterial abundance and activity were measured in a third order stream along a land use gradient from pristine agricultural to urban landscapes dom composition showed a clear evolution along the river course with an initial decrease of average oxidation and unsaturation followed by an increased relative abundance of chno and chos compounds introduced by agriculture and waste water respectively dom composition was dominated by rather unsaturated cho compounds h c 1 in headwaters and by more aliphatic molecules at downstream sites oxygenated functional groups shifted from aromatic ethers and hydroxyl groups to aliphatic carboxylic acids and aliphatic hydroxyl groups this massive dislocation of oxygen significantly increased the diversity of atomic environments in branched aliphatic groups from headwater to downstream dom mass spectra of dom enabled the detection of compositional relationships to bacterial abundance and activity which was positively related to more aliphatic components h c 1 and negatively related to unsaturated components fticr mass and nmr spectra corroborated the initial decline in dom molecular diversity predicted by the river continuum concept rcc but demonstrated an anthropogenic increase in the molecular diversity of dom further downstream while the high dom molecular diversity in first order headwater streams was the result of small scale ecosystem plurality agriculture and waste water treatment introduced many components in the lower reaches these anthropogenic influences together with massive bacterial oxidation of dom contributed to a growth of molecular diversity of downstream dom whose composition and structure differed entirely from those found in pristine headwaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords dom fticr ms nmr stream wwtp bacterial production biofilm 1 introduction streams and rivers are important sites for organic carbon processing they receive considerable amounts of terrestrial organic matter aufdenkampe et al 2011 of which a large proportion is humic like aromatic rich material dominated by lignin and tannin compounds mosher et al 2015 along the river course from mountain springs and headwaters to the lowlands algal photosynthesis contributes to increasing proportions of autochthonous dom jaffe et al 2012 parr et al 2015 the river continuum concept predicts a high molecular diversity of dom in first order streams with high proportions of groundwater dom and decreasing diversity in second order to fifth order streams vannote et al 1980 on the other hand rivers receive molecules from anthropogenic sources such as agriculture industry and waste water treatment hosen et al 2014 parr et al 2015 contributing to the overall molecular diversity of dom thus it is very likely that the molecular diversity of riverine dom will evolve along the river course and might in fact increase from the source to the confluence with higher order streams dom quality and its changes in streams are commonly assessed using fluorescence spectra cory and kaplan 2012 hosen et al 2014 parr et al 2015 several indices relating specific excitation and emission wavelengths were developed e g an increased freshness index fellmann et al 2010 indicates more microbially produced dom and a decreased humification index zsolnay 2003 indicates less plant derived dom due to farming which increased also dissolved organic nitrogen concentration graeber et al 2015 in urban streams the proportion of humic like allochthonous dom was lower whereas the more bioavailable autochthonous dom showed higher proportions parr et al 2015 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms detects gas phase ions of molecules with very high molecular resolution enabling the assignment of thousands of cho chno chos and chnos molecular formulas hertkorn et al 2008 however it is subject to ionization selectivity and many isomeric molecules may project on any individual mass peak nmr spectroscopy allows the analysis and quantification of carbon and hydrogen based aliphatic oxygenated and aromatic chemical environments of atoms together fticr and nmr mass spectra provide complementary information about structure and molecular composition of dom hertkorn et al 2007 while in recent years several mass spectrometry based studies of riverine dom were performed at single sites of one or more streams kim et al 2006 stubbins et al 2010 sleighter et al 2014 wagner et al 2015 only a single study mosher et al 2015 covered a longitudinal transect from headwater streams proceeding downstream to the best of our knowledge no nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr analysis covers evolution of riverine dom along the river course biological processing of dom in streams and rivers is mainly performed by heterotrophic bacteria and leads to breakdown of large molecule and ultimate co2 emissions from running waters while other fractions of dom might flocculate and become part of sedimentary carbon or are exported to the ocean cole et al 2007 battin et al 2008 hale and godsey 2019 this processing can be performed by planktonic suspended stream water bacteria or by epilithic bacteria associated in biofilms battin et al 2003 2008 previous studies have shown that the activity of planktonic bacteria was related to dom quality while activity of biofilm bacteria was not due to benthic algae and extracellular polymeric substances as additional carbon sources in biofilms kamjunke et al 2015 however bacterial activity was only related to bulk optical parameters and could not be related to specific carbon species so far here we tested the hypotheses that 1 dom diversity decreases along the river course and 2 bacterial abundance and activity are related to specific dom components this research requires a highly resolved molecular dom characterization not commonly available in this contribution we related fticr ms and nmr based better constrained molecular composition and structure of riverine dom to biological processing along a representative german third order stream with a land use gradient ranging from pristine headwaters with forest catchment through a variety of urban and agricultural areas with well documented land use wollschläger et al 2017 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the study was done in the holtemme catchment area in the harz mountains germany which is part of an observation network called terrestrial environmental observatories tereno wollschläger et al 2017 the holtemme river is a third order river in the elbe catchment area with a long term mean annual discharge of 1 34 m3 s 1 gauging station mahndorf that originates at 862 m a s l and flows into the bode river the land use in the catchment is dominated by agriculture 60 followed by forests 30 and urban 10 areas wollschläger et al 2017 the hydromorphology is natural in the upstream sections but highly impacted due to channeling riparian clearcutting and incision in urban and agricultural areas the river receives substantial pollution from two wastewater treatment facilities serving a population equivalent of more than 40 000 each and from tributaries draining agricultural areas sampling of dom quality and bacteria was performed at 12 sites from headwater to

ranks herzsprung et al 2017 the rank correlations were performed on the basis the calculated inter sample ranks of the molecular compositions which were present in all 12 samples n 749 see si for details 2 3 3 analysis based on normalization of mass peak intensities of single components the relative mass peak intensities n 4616 all different components with present counts between 1 and 12 were obtained from intensity normalized mass spectra osterholz et al 2016 kamjunke et al 2017 this procedure was applied to each of the 12 samples and was used to evaluate longitudinal dom quality changes we applied a linear regression between the relative mass peak intensity as dependent variable and the distance of the sampling sites from the source where the slope was regarded as semi quantitative parameter for the change a positive negative slope basically means an increase decrease of the component abundance along the flow length for visualization in van krevelen diagrams we used only

sources i e which were not present in all samples we performed spearman correlations for linked equal values sachs 1974 with the intersample ranked intensities herzsprung et al 2012 which were present in at least 7 samples and with p 0 05 r2 0 332 3 results 3 1 bulk parameter analysis discharge increased continuously from the source to site 6 which might be explained by the inflow of several tributaries and the effluent of the first wwtp fig 2 further downstream discharge remained nearly constant with low contributions of tributaries doc concentrations were highest in the headwater section and decreased from site 1 to site 4 partly due to dilution by tributaries with lower doc concentration from there the doc was nearly constant at a level of about 3 mg l 1 fluorescence and freshness index increased slightly until site 4 showed a steep increase in response to the first wwtp and remained constant afterwards humification index and specific uv absorption decreased until site 5 and did not change further downstream fticr mass spectra showed clear changes along its river course spe dom from sites 1 and 2 showed skewed near gaussian type distributions of mass peaks with a steeper slope toward lower mass m z 350 than toward higher mass m z 450 fig s1 overall mass peak distributions became more symmetrical downstream from site 3 downstream various groups of sharp mass peaks indicated restricted sets of abundant molecules at sites 4 and 5 patterning indicated presence of either abundant biomolecules from dom processing or anthropogenic compounds from site 7 downwards a distinct group of low mass peaks m z 300 appeared the average h c ratio indicated a transition from more unsaturated sites 1 3 toward more saturated aliphatic molecules at sites 4 12 whereas the o c ratio decreased from sites 2 5 the o c ratio slightly increases from site 5 7 and decreased in response to the second wwtp again where h c increased in parallel fig 2 the average oxidation state of carbon osc as well as the average mass continually declined from site 2 until sample 5 after wwtp 1 and showed similar behaviour as the o c ratio 3 2 classification and inter sample ranking the hierarchical cluster analysis hca computed from ftms derived molecular compositions which were present at all 12 sites fig s1b showed that the dom quality in the headwater up to site 3 was completely different from the dom quality in the lower course sites 4 7 were rather similar among themselves with sites 4 5 and 6 7 most likewise whereas sites 8 12 were even more alike with site 9 slightly dissimilar the inter sample rankings analysis projected on van krevelen diagrams revealed more specific differences in dom quality fig 3 the headwater sites 1 3 showed mainly 1st to 4th ranks for o rich polyphenol like and highly unsaturated o rich h c 1 components van krevelen coordinates shown in fig s4 according to rossel et al 2017 in the following combined and named as o rich dbe richcomp herzsprung et al 2012 and 9th to 12th ranks for more aliphatic and oxygen poor components o c 0 5 and h c 1 and some oxygen rich components with h c 1 the samples from sites 4 7 showed middle ranks for o rich dbe richcomp 3rd to 8th whereas the downstream sites 8 12 showed 7th to 12th ranks for these components overall higher ranks shifted from o rich dbe richcomp toward higher aliphaticity h c ratio and less oxygenation o c ratio along the river course of holtemme 3 3 analysis of the slope of fticr mass peak intensities along the holtemme river course the evolution of molecular compositions along the river course was deduced from changes in relative mass peak intensity versus distance from holtemme origin an example plot fig s5a covers five representative molecular compositions three cho and one chos chno molecules each the slopes were visualized according to cho chno and chos compounds fig 4a the relative intensity of o rich dbe richcomp decreased considerably fig 4a section b along the holtemme river whereas compounds of near average unsaturation and oxygenation increased in relative abundance fig 4a section a chno of overall smaller chemodiversity than cho compounds 0 8 h c 1 3 0 4 o c 0 7 near continually increased along the holtemme river fig 4a section c while the majority of chos components showed higher extent of oxygenation but near identical relative unsaturation 1 h c 1 7 0 4 o c 0 8 than respective cho compounds fig 4a section e three characteristic ch2 based homologous series of chos components strongly increased downstream fig 4a section d table s6 the distinct evolution of dom molecular compositions downstream was visualized by recognizing only molecular compositions which first appeared at the specific sampling points 2 11 any composition in site 1 is new by definition and then remained abundant in all consecutive sampling points downstream fig 4b the presence of new components mainly chos was first observed at site 5 as response to wwtp1 at site 6 the highest number of new components was detected the 153 components which were absent in samples 1 5 and present in samples 6 12 are shown in an additional van krevelen diagram insert a suite of chno compounds showed considerable oxygenation and unsaturation in the last downstream sample from site 12 the many new appearing components represent an inevitable artefact of the last sampling point analogous low intensity components are exclusively observed in any sample but not present in other samples riedel and dittmar 2014 components with the lowest percentage intensity values are not far from signal to noise ratio components present in all samples had the highest intensities whereas components present in only one sample had comparably low intensities table s7 the overall count of molecular compositions uniformly declined from site 1 reaching a minimum count at site 4 to grow again to site 6 to then stay nearly constant fig 4c the proportions of molecular series also changed the relative abundance of cho compounds declined nearly continually from source to outflow whereas the relative proportion of non oxygen heteroatom containing molecules grew in the order chnos chno chos compounds with a decisive onset from site 4 fig s2 while the average c n ratio levelled off from site 6 the c s ratio more gradually declined along the river course table s5 with recognition of the sharp increase in abundance of chno chos and chnos compounds from site 6 downstream fig 4c another hca was computed based solely on these molecular compositions which were present in all samples from site 6 to site 12 fig s3 here samples from sites 6 and 7 were quite similar while all remaining samples 8 12 clustered distinctly the attendant van krevelen diagram showed that these compounds were of average oxygenation and fairly unsaturated the relative unsaturation as expressed by the average h c ratio and the overall chemodiversity declined in the order chos chno chnos components group specific results showed a decrease of o rich dbe richcomp from sample 1 5 fig 5 a the group highly unsaturated o poor components and the group highly unsaturated o rich 1 h c 1 5 both increased from sample 1 4 the first one increased further to sample 5 but the latter one decreased from sample 4 5 regarding chos components all components with steep increases along the lines d1 d2 and d3 in fig 4a were not detectable between sites 1 4 they increased steeply after the first wwtp decreased at sites 6 and 7 except for c17h26o5s and showed a strong increase again downstream the second wwtp chno and chnos showed mainly different behaviour to the d1 d2 and d3 chos fig s6 3 4 1h nmr spectra all 1h nmr spectra of holtemme spe dom from sites 1 12 showed broad superimposed nmr resonances typical of a fairly processed riverine organic matter however groups of relatively sharp aliphatic and aromatic nmr resonances indicative of rather early stages of dom processing were more abundant in the upstream region all spe dom featured a high aliphaticity with a substantial proportion of open chain aliphatic carboxylic acids cf below the evolution of the 1h nmr section integrals along the river course appeared inconspicuous table s7 a rather marginal decline of purely aliphatic units ccc h was compensated to a minor extent by an increased abundance of functionalized aliphatics occ h while oxygenated aliphatic units oc h remained nearly constant fig s9 table s9 hca and pca resulted in a clear distinction of sites from sites 1 and 2 against all other samples fig s10 while the further evolution of dom along the river course was not governed by a straight process the distinction of spe dom 1 probably reflected genuine contributions from natural input of phenolic and lignin rich materials from a pristine forest environment which also caused an elaborate and abundant array of och3 groups table s9 fig s11a fig s12 spe dom 2 was dominated by a uniquely abundant and rather specific lipid like component resonating at the positions δh 0 90 1 24 1 35 1 55 1 63 2 03 and 2 17 ppm which showed resolved j couplings this is indicative that these distinct nmr features arose from only a few compounds these abundant lipid like components relatively attenuated the amplitude of all other background nmr resonances typical for natural organic matter which reflected a higher diversity of directly oc h and remotely ocn h n 2 oxygenated aliphatic branching motifs in general a direct comparison of spe dom from sites 1 and 2 fig s12 demonstrated that apart from the unique set of lipid like compounds the section of common nom molecules was far less oxygenated at site 2 than at site 1 while still showing an appreciable diversity of aliphatic branching motifs hertkorn et al 2015 values of 1h nmr section integrals with 0 01 ppm resolution were related to the river distance of the 12 sites see fig s5b for five examples resulting in a slope over the river stretch for each integral a comparison of area normalized 1h nmr spectra at full resolution revealed significant trends of dom structure chemical evolution along the river course which were not available from 1h nmr section integrals fig 6 in summary open chain aliphatics of a limited structural diversity which comprised mainly variants of hooc chα chβ chγ chδ ch3 units produced groups of relatively sharp nmr resonances which were more abundant in the headwaters than downstream these hugely superimposed nmr resonances were caused by a mixture of many open chain branched aliphatic carboxylic acids and resonated at rather specific positions δh chα 2 1 2 4 ppm δh chβ 1 6 ppm δh chγ 1 35 ppm δh chδ ε 1 3 ppm δh ch3 0 89 ppm hertkorn et al 2015 these prominent nmr resonances became gradually attenuated while broad nmr resonances ranging from δh 0 9 2 8 ppm and 3 4 4 3 ppm near continually grew in abundance when proceeding downstream from source to mouth fig 6c figs s11a and b these broad nmr resonances represented an enormous diversity of aliphatic compounds with alicyclic rings meckenstock et al 2014 and remote oxygen substitution ocn h n 2 at δh 0 9 2 0

3 3 4 8 ppm figs s11a and b 3 5 bacterial abundance and production and their correlation to dom quality the abundance of planktonic bacteria started with low values in headwaters showed a first increase between sites 4 5 and a larger increase between sites 7 8 fig 7 planktonic bp was lowest in the headwaters of holtemme sites 1 and 2 and increased at sites 3 5 and 9 the cell specific bp was highest at site 3 and decreased downstream the longitudinal variability of biofilm bacterial abundance was lower than that of planktonic bacteria with a maximum value at site 5 the longitudinal dynamics of biofilm bp and cell specific biofilm bp was not very pronounced the assimilable organic carbon ranged from 0 02 to 0 2 mg c l 1 and showed particularly high values at sites 5 and 10 abundance and bp of planktonic bacteria were positively related to fluorescence and freshness index of dom and negatively to humification index and suva whereas no relationships were found for cell specific bp table s10 biofilm abundance and bp as well as aoc did not correlate to dom fluorescence planktonic abundance showed very strong positive correlations to fticr ms components with low o c and high h c ratios and very strong negative correlations to components with high o c and low h c ratios fig 8 planktonic bp was less strongly related to these groups and cell specific bp showed only few significant correlations fig s15 biofilm abundance and bp showed few specific positive relationships to components with h c 1 and different o c and negative ones to components with h c 1 and o c 0 5 the aoc was negatively related to very few components the spearman correlations considering components present at at least 7 sites were also strongest for planktonic abundance and bp for cho chno and particularly chos components whereas correlations to biofilm bp were moderate and to biofilm abundance and aoc were weaker figs s14a c parameters of bacterial abundance and activity were also correlated to section integrals of 1h nmr spectra fig 9 planktonic abundance and bp were mainly positively related particularly at δh 1 0 5 0 ppm and δh 6 5 9 0 ppm biofilm abundance and bp showed positive rank correlation coefficients at δh 1 0 2 8 ppm and δh 6 5 8 0 ppm in contrast aoc showed mainly negative rank correlation coefficients 4 discussion 4 1 insights in dom dynamics from bulk optical parameters and elemental composition several studies investigated the effect of agricultural land use on dom quality in rivers by measuring its optical properties usually the humification index hix as a measure of terrestrial dom decreased and the freshness index β α as a measure of autochthonous dom increased with an increase of agriculture in the catchment graeber et al 2015 as a consequence of changing dom quality the partial pressure of co2 in water was higher in agricultural streams compared to forest streams it was negatively correlated to molecular size and allochthonous dom kamjunke et al 2013 bodmer et al 2016 in the holtemme river doc concentration was highest in the headwaters and remained rather constant after an initial decrease the humification index decreased by a factor of three from forest to agricultural catchments whereas the freshness index doubled along that reach which is typical in streams e g williams et al 2010 kamjunke et al 2015 ejarque et al 2017 joint analyses using structural and optical properties of dom in combination were recently applied to investigate dom quality with molecular resolution lavonen et al 2015 hertkorn et al 2016 herzsprung et al 2017 and we also correlated fluorescence indices and fticr ms results for the holtemme e g positive correlation between o rich dbe richcomp and hix and suva fig s8 we observed o rich dbe richcomp fig 3 with high molecular weight table s4 in headwaters of the holtemme which were found also for soil organic matter at forested sites seifert et al 2016 the relative abundances of o rich dbe richcomp decreased downstream in the holtemme the high upstream concentrations which are confirmed by high hix values might be explained by the large proportion of forests and wetlands in the upper catchment which are usually a source of such highly oxygen rich and aromatic components the decrease of o rich dbe richcomp concentrations downstream had four potential causes photodegradation stubbins et al 2010 riedel et al 2016 dilution precipitation with iron minerals dadi et al 2017 and mixing with a tributary containing different dom quality biodegradation of o rich dbe richcomp is less important in these fast flowing cold headwaters as these components are assumed to be relatively recalcitrant in the dark riedel et al 2016 whereas dilution play a role in the upstream part of holtemme fig 2 4 2 process analyses by combination of structural information and elemental composition 1h nmr spectra demonstrated that the main structural changes of spe dom from source to mouth comprised a very significant oxidation of riverine spe dom which referred to an increasing abundance of both direct oxygenation products oc h units and even more significant carboxylation r c h n cooh units the introduction of oxygen imposes remote substituent effects on δh up to four bonds away the superposition of much more numerous different aliphatic chemical environments in the downstream reaches eventually produced even more continual broad nmr resonance envelopes at the expense of intense nmr resonances originating from oxygen depleted simple aliphatic branching motifs fig 6c broad nmr resonances poor in distinct features are characteristic of a highly processed organic matter like those found in downstream spe dom the diversification of aliphatic components along the river stretch corresponded well with the increased abundance of rather aliphatic components with high h c and low o c ratios observed by fticr ms the slight decrease of aromatic components indicated by nmr was in accordance with the decrease of o rich dbe richcomp with low h c and high o c shown by fticr ms stoichiometry of dom was shown to alter with changing land use gücker et al 2016 holtemme river showed higher proportions of chno chos and chnos compounds in urbanized and agricultural areas compared to forest catchments fig s2 in line with previous results wagner et al 2015 the observed increase in relative abundance of single chos compounds and the group chos1 o poor downstream the wwtp fig 5 fig s6 corresponds to highly abundant chos compounds found in effluent organic matter by gonsior et al 2011 the chos derived mass peaks with highest abundances in effluent organic matter could be attributed to anthropogenic surfactants such as linear alkyl benzene sulfonates their co products dialkyl tetralin sulfonates and their biodegraded metabolites such as sulfophenyl carboxylic acids gonsior et al 2011 wang et al 2018 as an example the component c14h20o5s is potentially a sulphenyl carboxylic acid and c15h20o5s a dialkyl tetralin sulfonate intermediate gonsior et al 2011 the molecular complexity can be increased in effluent organic matter tseng et al 2013 in contrast to the chos the increase of chno compounds fig 4 fig s6 and the appearance of some chno compounds at site 6 fig 4b in holtemme river can be explained by diffuse sources from agriculture this was confirmed the increase of chn1o and chn2o group between samples 5 and 6 fig s6 chno were also reported to originate from effluent organic matter mesfioui et al 2012 several chno components increased after both wwtps e g c14h17n1o8 fig s6 however wwtps seemed to be a minor source for chno compared to agriculture as sampling was performed under base flow conditions when the relative contribution of point sources is expected to be high compared to diffuse sources the importance of agricultural chno import into the holtemme river should be even higher at high discharge 4 3 dom diversity natural decline versus increase by human activity and microbial oxygenation the river continuum concept rcc vannote et al 1980 proposed maximum molecular diversity of dom in headwaters and a continual decrease of dom molecular diversity downstream vannote et al 1980 fragmentation of ecosystems in mountainous headwater streams contributes to differences in dom formation conditions on very small spatial scales leading to increased molecular diversity mosher et al 2015 lynch et al 2019 whereas larger water bodies such as higher order streams are subject to mixing attenuation of gradients and equilibration of dom formation conditions this predicted pattern was confirmed by the results in the upper part of holtemme river dom diversity based on fticr mass spectrometry showed the highest number of compositions at site 1 n 2396 and remarkably declined toward site 4 n 969 fig 4c nmr spectra demonstrated dominance of certain aliphatic branching motifs in the headwaters of holtemme river fig 6c this does not necessarily imply the presence of a restricted count of diverse molecules but it means that the majority of these molecules share a certain set of oxygen deficient aliphatic branching motifs hertkorn et al 2015 nom is commonly more oxygenated than biological metabolites and it carries significantly higher proportions of quaternary carbon atoms lam et al 2007 headwater dom features mainly forest derived organic matter which primarily consists of lignin and tannin derived biogeochemical organic molecules of decent oxygenation and often lipid derived common biomolecules which are highly aliphatic with a low average degree of oxygenation therefore initially produced dom shows an intermediate degree of unsaturation and a relative depletion of heteroatoms however the number of components increased again toward site 7 n 2543 and stayed nearly constant further downstream table s4 in stream algal derived primary production initially generates primarily aliphatic and rather oxygen deficient lipid derived metabolites apart from fast cycling carbohydrates which are poorly retained by spe and also do not ionize well in negative esi however continual breakdown of larger size molecules and aggregates is accompanied by progressive bacterial oxidation of riverine doc and poc here oxygen is introduced on a massive scale to produce carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram hertkorn et al 2006 lam et al 2007 materials derived from linear terpenoids mdlt lam et al 2007 arakawa et al 2017 and many other oxidation products with an overall higher compositional and structural diversity than found in the starting materials in holtemme river human activities like agriculture and wwtp probably have contributed to introduction of chno chos and chnos compounds into riverine dom fig 4b table s4 some of it also through groundwater input graham et al 2018 in the most downsteam reaches of holtemme it becomes progressively more difficult to determine changes in the composition by fticr ms and structure by nmr of riverine dom evolved dom is subject to a myriad of biochemical transformations which nevertheless are dominated by a very few nominal transformations moritz et al 2017 such as e g hydroxylation o methylation ch2 de hydration h2o glycosylation c6h12o6 de acetylation c2h2o and carboxylation co2 which are imposed on already pre existing dom molecules with an appreciable coverage of the compositional space already in place hertkorn et al 2008 the vast majority of these reactions will project on compositions already present in the mixture fig s13 4 4 compound specific links to bacterial activity low values of planktonic bp were observed in the headwater sections at high doc concentrations since the dom was dominated by o rich dbe richcomp the quality of the dom was obviously more important than its concentration which had also been reported by shi et al 2016 the planktonic bp was enhanced with rising nitrate concentration site 3 and it further increased downstream of the two wwtps from site 4 to 5 and from site 7 to 8 planktonic abundance and bp were particularly correlated to oxygen poor chos components released by the wwtps fig s14c in maine us decreased proportions of humic like allochthonous dom and increased abundance of bioavailable autochthonous doc amounts in urbanized streams doubled the doc decay rate and increased the activity of carbon acquiring enzymes parr et al 2015 in headwaters microbial bioavailability of dom was greater in urbanized streams with decreasing proportions of humic like dom and increasing proportions of protein like dom hosen et al 2014 in contrast the long term bacterial growth did not mirror the longitudinal dynamics of bp in our study it was high at wwtp a at site 5 but not at wwtp b followed by a subsequent decrease and downstream a weir site 10 where the stagnant water might have changed bacterial community composition usually effluents of wwtps increase the number of live bacteria extracellular enzyme activity perujo et al 2016 leucine aminopeptidase activity and respiration aristi et al 2015 compared to the upstream sites planktonic bp increased with decreasing hix and increasing β α as already observed for the whole bode catchment kamjunke et al 2015 lower hix and higher β α values had suggested an enhanced bp in agricultural streams previously williams et al 2010 this could be corroborated by many negatively correlated fticr ms components with planktonic bp of those many were o rich dbe richcomp which are shown to positively correlate with the hix fig s6 as confirmed by literature lavonen et al 2015 herzsprung et al 2017 the positive correlation of planktonic bp to β α can be explained by many positively correlated components with more aliphatic character h c 1 for most of them negative correlation may either mean that the component was more consumed if bp was high or that bp was inhibited simple correlations alone would not enable distinction of these two types of dom processing biofilm bp showed less variability compared to planktonic bp and was not related to bulk dom characteristics such as hix and β α as described before kamjunke et al 2015 with the recognition of fticr ms derived molecular compositions only few correlations were found for biofilms which was true also for long term bacterial growth the mainly positive slopes of nmr intensities over the river stretch in the range δh 1 5 ppm fig 6c coincided with mainly positive correlations between the respective nmr section integrals and planktonic and biofilm bp fig 9 this indicates that the increase of nmr components was positively related to bp the increase of nmr slopes in downstream direction between δh 7 8 ppm positively correlated with planktonic and biofilm bp indicating a microbial production of aromatic carboxylic acids 5 conclusion while the massive dislocation of oxygen observed in dom along the river course of river holtemme probably occurred from natural causes operating in pristine rivers sizable proportions of chos chno and chnos compounds were introduced in downstream reaches by anthropogenic activities the decrease of dom diversity in the upper part of holtemme hypothesis 1 was predicted by the river continuum concept rcc and reflected the transition from fragmented ecosystems in holtemme headwaters with a high diversity of dom formation conditions to a larger water body with attenuated gradients extensive mixing and more uniform conditions the influence of the wwtps was apparent by an increase of the freshness index decreasing oxidation state of carbon and an increase of several chos components mass spectrometry and nmr spectroscopy of dom along the holtemme river course revealed relationships between dom composition and bacterial activity which were not available from fluorescence indices hypothesis 2 further research should clarify the relative contributions of pristine in river

the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts dbps and cause health risks to humans monitoring the toxicity of chlorinated and ozonated water and identification of different toxicity mechanisms are therefore required this study is one of its kind to examine the toxic effects of chlorinated and ozonated wastewater effluents on three genetically modified bioluminescent bacteria in comparison to the naturally isolated cyanobacteria spirulina strains as test systems three different secondary wastewater effluents were collected from treatment plants chlorinated using sodium hypochlorite at 1 and 10 mg l 1 of chlorine or treated using 3 4 mg l 1 of ozone at different contact times as compared to cyanobacterial spirulina sp the genetically modified bacteria enhancing bioluminescence at the presence of stress agents demonstrated greater sensitivity to the toxicity induction and have also provided mechanism specific responses associated with genotoxicity cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species ros generation in wastewater effluents effects of effluent chlorination time and chlorine concentration revealed by means of bioluminescent bacteria suggest the formation of genotoxic and cytotoxic dbps followed with their possible disappearance at longer times ozonation could degrade genotoxic compounds in some effluents but the cytotoxic potential of wastewater effluents may certainly increase with ozonation time no induction of ros related toxicity was detected in either chlorinated or ozonated wastewater effluents uv absorbance and fluorescence emission based spectroscopic characteristics may be variously correlated with changes in genotoxicity in ozonated effluents however no associations were obtained in chlorinated wastewater effluents the bacterial response to the developed mechanism specific toxicity differs among wastewater effluents reflecting variability in effluent compositions graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorination ozonation

drinking and wastewaters usepa 2004 owing to their ability to inactivate human borne pathogens decompose inorganic and organic contaminants and degrade persistent organic matter om in water deborde and von gunten 2008 gomes et al 2009 liltved et al 1995 tyrrell et al 1995 however the interactions of natural organic matter nom with disinfection agents chlorination and reactions of bromide during

reflecting any imbalances with the antioxidant response beddowes et al 2003 yuan et al 2005 which is capable of causing carcinogenic and genotoxic effects in cells caro and cederbaum 2004 komaki et al 2009 multiple studies highlighted the formation of different types of dbps and their toxicity on various in vivo and in vitro models deng et al 2014 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2007 monarca et al 2004 stalter et al 2016 toxicity of disinfected water may be characterized using biomonitoring of daphnia fishes metazoans allium cepa mussels and mouse models da costa et al 2014 egito et al 2007 minissi et al 1996 monarca et al 2002 stalter et al 2010 vasseur and lasne 2012 however such assays are time consuming and require large sample quantities krewski et al 2009 the chinese hamster ovary cho cell lines are used as a selective biomonitoring tool for evaluating the toxicity of water samples plewa et al 2010 2004 2007 2008a but it requires 100 1000 fold concentrated samples and understanding the exact toxicity mechanisms is difficult using single growth inhibition assay in addition the use of natural bioluminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri received much attention as a model system to assess the toxicity of disinfected waters with commercially available test kits such as microtox lumistox biotox toxalert applitox and deltatox which measure the inhibition of bacterial luminescence light off upon exposure bayo et al 2009 emmanuel et al 2004 ma et al 2016 monarca et al 2004 park and choi 2017 however these model systems using natural bacteria bioluminescence fail also to measure the specific mode of toxicity such as genotoxicity cytotoxicity mutagenic and ros stresses induced by disinfected water nieuwenhuijsen et al 2009a 2009b plewa et al 2010 besides cyanobacteria have also been accepted as common toxicity indicators of the aquatic ecological web oecd 2011 iso 1989 previous studies supported the utilization of few algal species like pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and tetraselmis marina for examining the toxicity of disinfected and raw waters chhetri et al 2017 liu and zhang 2014 yang et al 2015 the sos chromotest quillardet et al 1982 umuc oda et al 1985 and ames tests maron and ames 1983 were suggested as sensitive reporter gene methods for detection of mutagenicity and genotoxicity in various disinfected waters kargalioglu et al 2002 zeng et al 2015 guzzella et al 2006 zani et al 2005 by measuring the induction of β galactosidase these tests are based on the response of bacterial strains escherichia coli sos chromotest pq37 sfia lacz salmonella typhimurium umuc ta1535 psk1002 and salmonella typhimurium ames ta100 ta98 exhibiting lacz reporter gene to mutagenic and genotoxic agents the response of lacz reporter gene against toxicity is measured with chromogenic substrates by the enzymatic transformation however the color interference may appear between substrate and samples mersch sundermann et al 1994 and the β galactosidase is highly stable hogness et al 1955 even after loss of cell viability thus limiting the application of these tests instead using recombinant dna techniques non luminescent bacterial strains i e e coli can be engineered with vibrio fischeri lux operon without the exogenous substrate engebrecht et al 1985 these recombinant bacteria are constructed in such a way that promoter genes for the specific stress responses associated with dna damage genotoxicity oxidative stress protein damage cytotoxicity are coupled with bacteria to express bioluminescence genes for luciferase lux as a toxicity bio reporter belkin et al 1997 these genetically modified bacteria exhibit low baseline luminescence which increases after exposure to toxic compounds lights on effect the engineered bioluminescence bacteria dpd2794 vollmer et al 1997 grpe van dyk et al 1994 and micf belkin et al 1997 provide rapid differential and easily measurable responses towards specific stress mechanisms such as genotoxicity cytotoxicity and ros generation as compared with natural non specific bioluminescence of bacteria vibrio fischeri even though genetically modified bacterial strains capable of responding to specific toxicity mechanisms were used previously eltzov et al 2009 eltzov et al 2015b 2015c zani et al 2005 there were no studies highlighting their differential response to the toxicity of variously chlorinated and ozonated wastewater effluents therefore the primary aim of this study was to characterize the development of toxicity of wastewater effluents during different disinfection procedures involving chlorination or ozonation using genetically modified bioluminescence bacteria with specific reporter genes responding to cytotoxicity genotoxicity and ros generation one expectation was that the formation of toxic dbps during chlorination will make itself evident in enhanced bioluminescence thus helping also to elucidate the roles of chlorine concentration and treatment time in the toxicity development the second expectation was that decomposition of nom due to ozonation is associated with a decrease in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity which may be quantified using response specific strains considering common use of cyanobacteria for examining the toxicity of disinfected and raw waters the second aim of this research was to compare the sensitivity of cyanobacteria spirulina sp vs bioluminescent bacteria in evaluating dynamics of toxicity development during chlorination and ozonation of treated wastewater effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1

characterization secondarily treated wastewater effluents were obtained from three different municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps and tagged as w1 w2 and w3 henceforth the effluents w1 and w2 were collected from mwtps located in raanana and kibbutz yagur respectively the third effluent w3 was obtained from the largest israeli mwtp shafdan situated in rishon lezion wastewater samples from all the three mwtps were after primary filtration and activated sludge treatment and did not pass chlorination wastewater effluent samples were collected in the sterile 10 l vessels and transferred to the laboratory within a few hours further the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm glass filter whatman to remove suspended material and stored at 4 c to minimize any changes filtered wastewater effluent samples were characterized with ph electric conductivity ec bante instruments dds 12dw conductivity meter and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations determined with toc l rohs shimadzu bromide concentration was measured with high performance ion chromatography dionex ics 2500 column as4a sc eluting bicarbonate buffer gp 50 gradient pump absorbance at 254 nm abs254 and fluorescence of filtered treated wastewater samples were also measured as detailed in supplementary information s1 2 3 chlorination and ozonation of wastewater chlorination commercial sodium hypochlorite solution naocl was used for the preparation of chlorinating agent this solution was diluted and the actual concentration of ocl was determined spectrophotometrically with thermo scientific genesys 10 by measuring the absorbance at 292 nm ε 362 m 1 cm 1 chen 1967 then the stock solution of 500 mg l 1 was used to prepare working concentrations of 1 and 10 mg l 1 for chlorination of wastewater samples chlorination was performed in headspace free amber glass bottles by incubating in the dark at 26 c in incubator shaker si 300 r lab companion for different contact times of 0 5 1 2 4 8 24 and 72 h respectively after each contact time the residual chlorine concentrations were determined using dpd free chlorine reagent by measuring spectrophotometrically absorbance of formed würster dye color at 510 nm palin 1957 residual chlorine concentrations were quantified using a calibration curve of known standard concentrations between 0 05 and 10 mg l 1 finally residual chlorine concentrations were stoichiometrically quenched with 0 1 m sodium thiosulfate ozonation the aquazone plus 50 instrument producing 50 mg of ozone per hour and equipped with the air supplier aqua serene air pump as 1061 was used to perform water ozonation air from the pump was dried by passing through a glass cylinder containing silica beads in a control experiment the generated o3 was sparged using 15 μm micro pore aerator through 100 ml of milli q water for 100 min during ozone purging the sample beaker containing water was placed in the ice bucket to enhance the ozone solubility and reduce the ozone decay the concentration of dissolved o3 was quantified in the 3 ml samples obtained at every 10 min intervals by potassium indigo trisulfonate method bader and hoigné 1981 for that absorbance at 600 nm was measured and ozone concentration was calculated following bader and hoigné 1981 based on the absorbance difference between the ozonated sample and blank solution the concentration of dissolved o3 was about 3 4 mg l 1 throughout the period of ozonation the same protocol of ozonation was applied for the treatment of wastewater effluents for different selected times no residual ozone was detected in treated wastewater effluent samples after treatment characterization chlorinated and quenched and ozonated effluent samples were characterized for ph ec and doc concentrations as described above absorbance at 254 nm abs254 specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva and fluorescence were also determined detailed in supplementary information s1 absorbance and fluorescence measurements at the wavelengths of interest were also tested in the control solutions containing 10 mg l 1 of chlorine and stoichiometrically quenched with sodium thiosulfate based on the control tests no contribution was expected from the products of quenching into light absorption and fluorescence of samples 2 4 wastewater toxicity characterized by genetically modified bioluminescent bacteria three different genetically modified bioluminescent bacteria named dpd2794 grpe and micf obtained as a gift from prof sh belkin hebrew university of jerusalem israel were used to examine the toxicity of sampled filtered chlorinated and ozonated wastewaters more details about the bioluminescent bacteria used are provided in supplementary information s2 these genetically modified bacterial strains were grown overnight on lb agar with 50 μg l 1 of ampicillin in order to maintain the plasmid in cells belkin et al 1997 at 37 c further a single isolated colony from lb agar plate was inoculated in 5 ml sterile lb broth containing 5 μg l 1 of ampicillin and kept at 37 c in shaking incubator gerhardt konigswinter germany at 120 rpm overnight eltzov et al 2009 2015 next day 250 μl of grown culture was inoculated in 25 ml of sterile lb broth and incubated at 30 c for nearly 5 h without shaking until it reached 0 2 units of absorbance measured in a 1 cm quartz cuvette at 600 nm thermo scientific genesys 10 uv vis spectrophotometer later the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 c and the pellet was re suspended with fresh lb broth and adjusted to the absorbance of 1 0 an analyzed water sample 160 μl was exposed to 40 μl of bacterial culture with the absorbance of 1 0 making the final water concentration as such as 80 of the initial ones and the bacterial culture with the absorbance of 0 2 in 96 well white plates bacterial culture and millipore water mixed in the same 1 to 4 proportion as analyzed water samples served as a control the luminescence values were measured as relative light units using microplate luminometer perkinelmer enspire 2300 multilabel reader at 26 c for every 5 min till 10 h the induction of luminescence of bacterial strain in response to the toxicity of water sample was indicated as if induction factor if relative luminescence of test sample relative luminescence of control the induction factor above 2 was considered as the definite toxicity induction pattern harpaz et al 2018 all the experiments were accomplished in triplicates the potential effect of salinity of the source chlorinated and ozonated samples on the bioluminescent bacteria was tested vs deionized millipore water served as a control with the nacl solution at a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 fig s5 supplementary information the additional test was performed in the deionized millipore water chlorinated with 10 mg l 1 of chlorine for 1 24 and 72 h and then stoichiometrically quenched with sodium thiosulfate fig s6 supplementary information this latter test was intended to examine a contribution from the salt background formed during chlorination quenching and the role of possibly non fully quenched residual chlorine present in the sample on bioluminescence the details of these tests including the selection of nacl concentration are provided in supplementary information s3 2 5 wastewater toxicity characterized by cyanobacteria a spirulina arthrospira platensis culture was used as a model organism to examine the toxicity of sampled filtered chlorinated and ozonated wastewaters the rapid in vivo fluorescence method was used to measure pigment content gregor and maršálek 2005 and to track the growth of cyanobacteria davidson 1991 bhuvaneshwari et al 2015 spirulina culture was grown in sp medium spirulina medium bg 11 in algal growth chamber equipped with white led lamps 30 μmol photons m 2 sec 1 at 24 c under 16 8 light dark photoperiod conditions cells were harvested at the exponential phase of growth by centrifuging at 6000 rpm for 10 min and washed with fresh sp medium for toxicity experiments 200 μl of spirulina culture with constant initial phycocyanine fluorescence intensity of 35000 a u corresponding to unit absorbance was exposed to 800 μl of a water sample in 48 well plates diluting water samples by 20 control group was prepared by using spirulina culture with sp medium instead of analyzed water samples the changes in phycocyanine contents of algal cells exposed to tested water were quantified using elisa plate reader biotek synergy neo2 multimode reader by measuring the fluorescence intensity upon excitation at 590 nm and emission at 650 nm phycocyanine for every 24 h till three days all the experiments were performed in triplicates the salinity effect was also tested by growing algae both in a 1000 mg l 1 nacl solution and in deionized millipore water chlorinated with 10 mg l 1 of chlorine for 1 24 and 72 h and then stoichiometrically quenched with sodium thiosulfate as with bioluminescent bacteria details in supplementary information s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of chlorination and ozonation on selected effluent characteristics measurements of abs254 fluorescence and doc concentrations in water samples are helpful to examine the effects of disinfection agents on effluent components and foremost om since changes in ph and ec of treated wastewater samples due to chlorination followed by quenching or ozonation were minimal if at all fig s4 a d these solution properties could not interfere with an examination of spectroscopic indices across the treatment fig 1 shows changes in abs254 of all three types of wastewater effluents in response to chlorination time at different applied chlorine concentrations 1 and 10 mg l 1 after quenching residual chlorine with sodium thiosulfate since abs254 is linked to the presence of aromatic compounds weishaar et al 2003 zsolnay and steindl 1991 its reduction suggests degradation of some aromatic structures in om or the loss of specific absorptivity due to chlorination increasing chlorine concentration led to a stronger decrease in abs254 of samples w1 and w3 thus suggesting larger extents of changes of aromatic components surprisingly treatment of effluent w2 with increased chlorine concentration 10 mg l 1 led to a slight but detectable increase of absorbance when comparing with the 1 mg l 1 treatment this may be understood as an indication of the formation of some products characterized by specific absorptivity larger than that of initial om components increased absorptivity may be caused by electronic effects of substituents in chlorinated om components for example chlorophenols are commonly produced at low levels during the interaction of chlorine with natural water constituents lee and morris 1962 wajon et al 1982 nist chemistry webbook 2019 reports log molar absorptivity of p chlorophenol at 254 nm slightly higher than that of phenol i e 2 75 vs 2 4 a slight increase in absorbance with the incorporation of chlorine was observed for other phenolic compounds e g resorcinol li et al 2000 beauchamp et al 2019 when fluorescence was examined in wastewater effluent solutions across chlorination treatments it was found to be affected by chlorination even less in some cases with no effective changes compared to non chlorinated effluents fig s1 also there were no notable changes in doc even at 10 mg l 1 of chlorine used fig s2a similar to our observation kim and yu 2005 reported that chlorination could induce significant changes in the chemistry of om while with a minor change in its concentration in contrast ozonation had a strong reducing effect on absorbance and fluorescence of effluents fig 2 others have also shown the reducing effect of ozonation on abs254 of wastewater effluents hua et al 2006 mao et al 2014 which was linked to cleavage of aromatic carbon carbon bonds von gunten 2003 however doc was remained unchanged fig s3a demonstrating that ozonation was not effective to abate doc in agreement with mao et al 2014 the suva of source wastewater effluents was about 1 5 1 3 and 1 7 l mg 1 m 1 indicating moderate aromaticity i e 2 3 l mg 1 m 1 ates et al 2007 but the 100 min ozonation decreased the suva of effluents w1 w2 and w3 by factors of 2 30 1 54 and 2 86 respectively thus bringing it below 1 l mg 1 m 1 indicative of the relatively low om aromaticity fig s3b fluorescence changes due to ozonation fig 2b and c were even more significant than the abs254 changes fig 2a for example after ozonation for 100 min the maximal fluorescence determined upon excitation at 335 nm fig 2b decreased by 91 81 and 94 for w1 w2 and w3 respectively as compared with intensities measured in non ozonated effluents fluorescence measured at excitation emission wavelengths nm 300 380 400 450 and 220 250 320 370 fig 2b and c is associated with humic like and proteinaceous structures respectively coble 1996 sierra et al 2005 this suggests that ozonation succeeded to effectively degrade some humic like and proteinaceous components present in the wastewater effluents examined to summarize chlorination and ozonation of the treated wastewater effluents studied had no effect on doc concentrations but had variable impacts on the presence of uv absorbing aromatic compounds and fluorophores chlorination mostly affected compounds absorbing at 254 nm as compared with fluorescent components whereas ozone was especially successful in decomposing fluorescent constituents ec and ph of water samples both ozonated and chlorinated and then quenched are not the factors which could induce the changes in algal growth or bioluminescence of bacteria exposed to effluents after different disinfection treatments 3 2 toxicity of chlorinated wastewater effluents probed with bioluminescent bacteria 3 2 1 genotoxicity assessment fig 3 a b c reports the bioluminescence ifs of genotoxicity sensitive bacteria in each of three effluents w1 w2 and w3 against chlorination time at two chlorine concentrations applied these ifs represent the bioluminescence measured in a test sample and normalized by that value determined in a control where the control was prepared by mixing the bacteria culture with deionized millipore water instead of test solution the details are in materials and methods it is clear from fig 3 a c that the 0 45 μm filtered wastewater effluents were genotoxic prior to any disinfection the induction factor values were in the order of w1 w3 w2 with the if 21 5 1 1 13 8 2 2 and 6 1 0 5 respectively fig 3a c the major effects in effluent genotoxicity in fig 3 a c were not related to salt induced stress since the salinity tests described in section s3 of supplementary information showed the if values not exceeding 2 figs s5 and s6 in supplementary information chlorinated w1 was always significantly less genotoxic compared to non treated w1 fig 3a treatment with 10 mg l 1 of chlorine for 72 h removed the genotoxicity of effluent w1 by 75 cao et al 2009 observed the 28 reduction in wastewater effluent toxicity treated by the same chlorine concentration determined using sos umu bioassay wu et al 2010 reported the 10 decrease in toxicity values of chlorinated wastewater compared to non chlorinated samples by sos umu bioassay the if in the chlorinated w1 effluent fig 3a was increased with the concentration of initially added chlorine at all kinetics intervals except the longest one 72 h since quenching in our experimental protocols removed the residual chlorine remaining in effluents the observed pattern suggests that the increasing chlorine concentration increases the genotoxicity potential by the production of dbps as the contact time of chlorination increases at 1 mg l 1 of chlorine production of dbps increases the genotoxicity response of effluent w1 fig 3a and eventually reaches a steady state from 8 h if 5 6 0 7 to 72 h if 4 9 1 5 application of higher chlorine concentration 10 mg l 1 showed a time dependent increase in if and further a decrease remarkably at 72 h the treatments of effluent w1 using two different chlorine concentrations led to the similar if fig 3a this is suggestive for the interplay between the enhanced formation of genotoxic substances at the higher chlorine concentration 10 mg l 1 and their disappearance due to either volatilization or degradation monarca et al 2000 xie and reckhow 1993 as an example haloacetamides hams exhibiting higher genotoxicity potential than other dbp types plewa et al 2008a can further decompose in the presence of chlorine to form less genotoxic n cl hams and finally haloacetic acids ding et al 2018 in contrast to w1 which was always significantly less genotoxic upon chlorination compared to non treated effluent fig 3a wastewater effluent w2 became generally more genotoxic upon chlorination fig 3b the genotoxicity rise in effluent w2 was chlorine dose dependent non chlorinated w3 similar to w1 was capable of significant genotoxicity fig 3c treatment of w3 with 1 mg l 1 of chlorine at any contact time reduced the genotoxicity of effluent samples obviously higher chlorine concentrations applied to effluent w3 led to the higher ifs values in all contact times fig 3c it may be noted that in all the treatment experiments residual concentrations of chlorine before quenching were detectable fig s8 experimenting with all the three wastewater effluents showed that i generally increase in concentration of chlorine increases the genotoxicity potential of chlorinated wastewater effluents and ii higher chlorine concentration applied tends to produce a bell shaped dependence of genotoxicity on the chlorination time with the initial if increase followed by a decreasing trend at a lower chlorine concentration used there is rather a saturation trend of genotoxicity with the treatment time most probably at the higher chlorine concentration concentrations of genotoxic dbps are also higher however at higher chlorine concentrations dbps might undergo some further transformations making them less toxic or just disappear from the system these results highlight that the chlorinated wastewater effluents possess dna damaging properties depending on chlorine dose and treatment time ohe et al 2004 reported that organic compounds in chlorinated water could induce frame shift mutation by ta 100 salmonella typhimurium strains other studies also showed the genotoxicity potential of chlorinated waters causing chromosomal aberrations frame shift mutation dna stand breaks using bacteria kargalioglu et al 2002 lv et al 2015 liu et al 2010 monarca et al 2000 cell lines yuan et al 2005 buschini et al 2004 human white blood cells maffei et al 2005 the variation in genotoxicity potential between three wastewater effluents observed in our study emphasizes the role of effluent composition our observations support the findings of dong et al 2017 that the production of dbps and their genotoxicity depend on the source chemical characteristics of water samples and type of disinfection agent used strong correlations between genotoxicity and some water parameters were also noted lv et al 2015 wang et al 2011 however we found no correlations between the if values and absorbance fluorescence and doc concentrations of water samples both non treated and chlorinated 3 2 2 cytotoxicity assessment fig 3 d f shows the factors of bioluminescence induction of the bacteria responding to cytotoxicity the first two effluents prior to chlorination showed a similar induction factor which was 1 8 fold lesser than that shown by third effluent 7 8 0 5 thus revealing the relatively lower cytotoxicity of w1 and w2 compared to w3 the if values of all three wastewater effluents at various chlorination times were higher than the ifs in the salinity testing experiments examining possible salt induced stress supplementary information figs s5 s6 and s7 section s3 upon w1 chlorination fig 3d 1 mg l 1 of chlorine there was a time dependent increase in if till 4 h and further it followed the decreasing trend the 10 mg l 1 chlorine concentration applied to the w1 effluent resulted in a drastic initial increase in if by 2 4 fold from the non chlorinated w1 effluent and a further increase in contact time decreased the cytotoxicity potential while it was always more than that of the non chlorinated w1 effluent the second wastewater effluent w2 fig 3e treated with 1 mg l 1 of chlorine did not show meaningful changes in induction factor as compared with the non chlorinated effluent while the elevated chlorine concentration 10 mg l 1 brought a substantial if increase at 1 h and remained steady state till 24 h before it decreases at 72 h coming to the third effluent fig 3f there is the development of cytotoxicity depending on the chlorination time for both chlorine concentrations applied also similarly to the genotoxicity response the higher chlorine concentration used led to generally increased bioluminescence thus indicating enhanced cytotoxicity these findings imply that chlorinated effluents caused a substantial change in the cellular metabolism of bacteria as a result of cytotoxicity the exact cytotoxicity mechanisms exerted by chlorinated dbps in disinfected waters are still not entirely clear but the reports strongly support that the inhibition of gadph glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase mediated glycolytic pathways can cause mitochondrial damage dad et al 2013 pals et al 2011 also limiting the cellular atp levels and metabolism ldh lactate dehydrogenase leakage gsh reduced glutathione decrease and accumulation of mda malondialdehyde level induce intracellular oxidative stress park and choi 2017 yuan et al 2005 thus finally causing cytotoxicity obviously dbps may differ in the mechanisms of their toxicity towards the target test organisms cortés and marcos 2018 also cytotoxicity associated ifs did not reveal associations with available data on doc absorbance and fluorescence of wastewater effluents 3 2 3 oxidative stress assessment when examining oxidative stress response to the possible ros generation fig 3g i the effect of wastewater effluents was small and non specific the comparable if values were obtained in all the three non chlorinated effluents chlorine concentration had no distinct effect on the development of ifs in the all three effluent samples and the effect of the time was very modest if at all except elevated toxicity for w1 and w3 at 4 h of chlorination therefore the chlorination did not involve distinct ros generated toxicity in our experiments though ros is known to play a significant role in the inactivation of microbial pathogens during disinfection due to its 105 times lower ct concentration multiplied by time compared to active chlorine and higher oxidation potential cho et al 2004a b most probably this is caused by the disappearance of ros from the system before testing the water sample toxicity 3 3 toxicity of ozonated wastewater effluents probed with bioluminescent bacteria one of the major concerns associated with water disinfection by ozonation is the ros production the formation of dbps pals et al 2013 or there could be an effective transformation of unknown products which contributes to certain toxic effects de vera et al 2015 fig 4 examines the changes in bacterial bioluminescence sensitive to genotoxicity cytotoxicity and ros upon ozonation of three wastewater effluents studied being a powerful oxidizing agent ozone strongly decreases the genotoxicity potential of w1 and w3 effluents by 8 9 and 5 4 fold at 100 min of treatment compared to non ozonated water fig 4a however w2 did not show strong differences in genotoxicity between ozonated and non ozonated effluents at all interaction time even though ozonation intensely degrades the uv absorbing and fluorescing om in w2 fig 2 it did not eliminate the genotoxic compounds present in this effluent fig 4a in fact it is known that multiple organic compounds present in wastewater may be stable against oxidation with ozone brunet et al 1984 and therefore the persistent toxicity might be well understood in the case of treating w1 and w3 with ozone the ifs decreasing with ozonation time strongly positively correlated with concurrent abs254 values r2 0 996 p 0 00001 and r2 0 918 p 0 00001 respectively the positive correlations were also found for genotoxicity ifs of w1 and w3 with fluorescence emission of humic like substances r2 0 971 p 0 00005 and r2 0 760 p 0 1057 respectively and of proteinaceous like substances r2 0 947 p 0 0002 and r2 0 595 p 0 042 respectively each correlation involved 21 points i e 7 triplicated values the fact that the genotoxicity potential of w1 and w3 i e if across the ozonation treatment correlated stronger with absorbance than with fluorescence may indicate that i uv absorbing constituents rather than the fluorescing ones are associated with genotoxicity or ii genotoxic components have similar degradability under ozone treatment as uv absorbing om the observed correlations suggest that abs254 and fluorescence emission might have a certain potential to serve as predictors for removal of genotoxic compounds in disinfected water in contrast the genotoxicity of w2 fig 4a showed statistically significant negative correlations with abs254 and fluorescence emission at the two maxima r2 0 844 p 0 0034 with abs254 r2 0 617 p 0 036 with humic like fluorescence and r2 0 660 p 0 026 with proteinaceous like fluorescence the negative correlations observed in effluent w2 may be explained by the formation of genotoxic substances associated with disappearance of less toxic chromophoric and fluorophoric precursors alternatively formation of genotoxic compounds may occur just in parallel with the decline in absorbance and fluorescence in the ozonation course since bromide was detected in the source wastewater effluents w1 w2 and w3 at concentrations of 470 220 and 480 μg l 1 ozonation might lead to the formation of bro3 which is genotoxic kurokawa et al 1986 lin et al 2014 reported that a steady increase in bro3 production leads to the formation of brominated dbps daiber et al 2016 muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008b and richardson et al 2010 reported that brominated dbps are relatively more genotoxic mutagenic than chlorinated dbps although the formation of bromate and brominated dbps could occur during ozonation of the effluents yet the whole genotoxic potential of w1 and w3 demonstrated a monotonous decline with ozonation time fig 4a hence either bromide associated induction of genotoxicity was negligible in these effluents or it was outweighed by the disappearance of other genotoxic constituents present in solution and undergoing oxidation and decomposition along the ozonation the second option might be supported by the data in w2 effluent in which a modest temporal rise in genotoxicity was observed fig 4a if this genotoxicity rise in w2 effluent is thought to be associated with the initial presence of bromide in solution then even a larger temporal genotoxicity increase should be expected in effluents w1 and w3 in which bromide concentration was greater as compared with w2 by a factor exceeding 2 since it did not happen in w1 and w3 fig 4a some other genotoxic constituents might disappear along ozonation cytotoxicity of wastewater effluent w1 was slightly decreased upon ozonation but eventually leading to the elevated if as compared to that of non ozonated effluent fig 4b also treating w2 with ozone led to slightly increased cytotoxicity formation of cytotoxic constituents due to wastewater effluent ozonation is very clear in the case of w3 specifically the cytotoxic potential expressed in the if of the w3 wastewater effluent ozonated for 100 min was 1 9 and 1 3 fold more than that one established for non ozonated w3 fig 4b and w3 treated by chlorine at the 10 mg l 1 concentration for 72 h fig 3f thus the cytotoxic effect of ozonated wastewater may be significant ros stress response to ozonation was very similar for all three wastewater effluents at all time intervals except for the w2 at 100 min fig 4c this result clearly states that wastewater effluent ozonation does not involve toxicity response associated with ros production which may be explained by the disappearance of short living and active ros 3 4 toxicity of wastewater effluents probed with cyanobacteria spirulina strain to address a second goal of the study cyanobacteria spirulina sp was tested to characterize the toxicity of the wastewater effluents undergoing chlorination or ozonation and the cyanobacteria response was compared with that of bioluminescent bacteria 3 4 1 effect of wastewater effluent chlorination on cyanobacteria spirulina strain fig 5 reports the measures quantifying phycocyanine pigment contents in spirulina sp exposed to variously chlorinated wastewater effluents in relative to the growth control in sp medium the data is grouped for a given effluent w1 w2 or w3 and certain growing time 0 24 48 and 72 h such that each group presents the relative pigment contents in wastewater effluent samples chlorinated for 0 0 5 1 2 4 8 24 and 72 h with the chlorine concentrations of 1 and 10 mg l 1 non chlorinated wastewater effluent w1 itself reduces the algal phycocyanine fluorescence by 55 within 24 h of algal growth followed by an 85 90 decrease at 72 h fig 5a this reduction was not associated with effluent salinity effect which was tested by growing cyanobacteria in a 1000 mg l 1 nacl solution section s3 in supplementary information there was no decrease in phycocyanine content of algal cells exposed to this nacl concentration as compared with the algal growth in the control sp medium lua and vonshak 2002 reported that presence of nacl at concentrations below 0 2 m 11700 mg l 1 did not affect the psii electron transfer from qa to qb photosystem ii photosynthetic oxygen evolution phycocyanine and chlorophyll content growth and biomass of spirulina according to sharma et al 2014 exposure of 0 4 m nacl significantly increases the phycocyanine pigment of spirulina platensis compared to that of the control group there was no difference in the pigment content of algae exposed for 24 h between chlorinated w1 1 mg l 1 of chlorine for different contact times and the non chlorinated ones when the chlorine concentration applied was 10 mg l 1 the pigment content in the algae exposed to the chlorinated w1 for 24 h even increased as compared with that of algae exposed to non chlorinated w1 fig 5a this may be understood as an indication that the effluent om is itself the factor reducing algae growth and the treatment with the higher chlorine dosage reduces concentrations of some aromatic om components fig 1 that may be toxic and in this way chlorination at higher dosage stimulated the growth at 48 and 72 h of algae exposure no matter whether the wastewater effluent w1 was chlorinated or not it showed a complete loss of phycocyanine fluorescence fig 5a and bleaching fig s9 w1 it appears that cyanobacterial growth was not sensitive to wastewater effluent w1 toxicity induced by chlorination as distinct from the marked effect of chlorination and chlorine concentration on the activity of bioluminescent bacteria fig 3a d in the case of w2 and w3 both chlorinated and non chlorinated wastewater effluents were hardly distinguishable in terms of pigment content except the 24 h exposure at this time interval there was a 20 30 decrease at some combinations of chlorine concentration mg l 1 chlorination time h fig 5b and c the series 1 72 10 0 5 10 1 and 10 2 at this 24 h exposure time longest chlorination duration i e 72 h or elevated chlorine concentrations 10 mg l 1 were needed to make toxicity of chlorinated wastewater effluent detectable with algae however when both higher chlorine dosage and longer contact times were applied the growth inhibition tended to be less thus again suggesting chlorination induced decomposition of some effluent components capable of being toxic for algae when using bioluminescent bacteria less chlorination time was needed to produce detectable toxicity which was observable after application of the lowest chlorine dose 1 mg l 1 fig 3 one reason contributing to lesser sensitivity of cyanobacteria to the formation of toxic dbps as compared to bioluminescent bacteria could be hypothesized to reflect the differences in the cell wall structure despite their overall prokaryotic gram negative nature thick peptidoglycan layers and multilayered membranes in the cyanobacteria cell walls hoiczyk and hansel 2000 may act as a mechanical and permeability barrier against toxicants yu et al 2014 3 4 2 effect of wastewater effluent ozonation on cyanobacteria spirulina strain the effects of wastewater effluent ozonation are demonstrated in fig 6 which shows phycocyanine pigment fluorescence in relative to the control in sp medium in cyanobacteria spirulina exposed for different times to variously ozonated effluents w1 w2 and w3 when spirulina was exposed to w1 for 24 h fig 6a initial ozonation of wastewater effluent reduced toxicity and increased pigment fluorescence in line with significant degradation of uv absorbing and fluorescent om in w1 fig 2 however ozonation exceeding 30 min even not leading to significant advanced degradation of om fig 2 induced toxicity trend with ozonation time fig 6a some similarity could be seen in this response to the if changes of the cytotoxicity sensitive bacteria exposed to ozonated w1 fig 4b where initial ozonation reduced effluent w1 toxicity but the advanced ozonation led eventually to its increase further there was strong inhibition of phycocyanine fluorescence by 90 at 48 and 72 h of exposure to w1 regardless of ozonation treating w2 with ozone did not significantly alternate the phycocyanine fluorescence of algal cells after 24 h exposure fig 6b also prolonged exposure of algae to wastewater effluent w2 did not reveal strong effects of ozonation however some increases of pigment fluorescence i e decreases of toxicity with ozonation time might be figured out for algae exposed to wastewater effluent for 48 and 72 h in contrast to algae there were indications for elevated geno cyto and ros associated toxicities towards bioluminescent bacteria in ozonated w2 effluent fig 4 treating w3 with ozone for 10 min decreased the pigment fluorescence by less than 25 compared to that in the non ozonated effluent at all days of algae exposure whereas extended ozonation time had either no any effect for 24 h exposure of algae or revealed a slight positive effect on pigment content i e decrease of toxicity when exposure times were 48 and 72 h when comparing with bacterial bioluminescence responses genotoxicity probing bacteria revealed the distinct decrease of w3 toxicity with ozonation time fig 4a and cytotoxicity sensitive bacteria detected a marked continuous increase of toxicity fig 4b there were no correlations found between water parameters i e abs254 and fluorescence and changes in phycocyanine fluorescence of algal cells at all growth times 24 48 and 72 h concentrations of chlorine and contact times of chlorination and ozonation followed 4 conclusions as the test systems used to assess the toxicity of chlorinated and ozonated wastewater effluents the genetically engineered bioluminescent bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to the effluent treatment with disinfecting agents by responding to chlorine concentration applied chlorination and ozonation times changes in bacteria bioluminescence suggest alterations in dna damaging properties of chlorinated wastewater effluents i e genotoxic potential and the cellular metabolism of bacteria i e cytotoxic potential chlorination induced time dependent development of geno and cytotoxicity is enhanced at an elevated chlorine concentration yet declining at prolonged treatment the detailed bioluminescence response to the induced toxicity depends on the type of toxicity mechanism and varies among wastewater effluents emphasizing the role of effluent composition depending on the wastewater effluent genotoxicity may be suppressed by ozonation or be hardly sensitive to that whereas the cytotoxic potential of wastewater effluents may distinctly increase with ozonation time thus variable responses of geno and cytotoxicity of wastewater effluents to ozonation time may be revealed with mechanism specific bioluminescence bacteria no correlations could be found between changes in the geno and cytotoxic potential of chlorinated wastewater effluents and absorbance at 254 nm fluorescence and doc concentrations of water samples in contrast statistically significant correlations were obtained between genotoxicity in differently ozonated effluents and such effluent properties as absorbance and fluorescence intensity associated with humic like and proteinaceous om these correlations in ozonated effluents may suggest a possibility to use spectroscopic parameters as predictors for the removal of toxic compounds in ozonated water bioluminescent bacteria are susceptible and sensitive as compared to cyanobacterial spirulina sp also providing mechanism specific responses associated with genotoxicity cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species generation in wastewater effluents when using bioluminescent bacteria less chlorination time or chlorine concentration were needed to produce detectable toxicity genetically modified bioluminescent bacteria could be the sensitive tool to study the risk posed by dbps production during chlorination and ozonation of water funding this work was

the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts dbps and cause health risks to humans monitoring the toxicity of chlorinated and ozonated water and identification of different toxicity mechanisms are therefore required this study is one of its kind to examine the toxic effects of chlorinated and ozonated wastewater effluents on three genetically modified bioluminescent bacteria in comparison to the naturally isolated cyanobacteria spirulina strains as test systems three different secondary wastewater effluents were collected from treatment plants chlorinated using sodium hypochlorite at 1 and 10 mg l 1 of chlorine or treated using 3 4 mg l 1 of ozone at different contact times as compared to cyanobacterial spirulina sp the genetically modified bacteria enhancing bioluminescence at the presence of stress agents demonstrated greater sensitivity to the toxicity induction and have also provided mechanism specific responses associated with genotoxicity cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species ros generation in wastewater effluents effects of effluent chlorination time and chlorine concentration revealed by means of bioluminescent bacteria suggest the formation of genotoxic and cytotoxic dbps followed with their possible disappearance at longer times ozonation could degrade genotoxic compounds in some effluents but the cytotoxic potential of wastewater effluents may certainly increase with ozonation time no induction of ros related toxicity was detected in either chlorinated or ozonated wastewater effluents uv absorbance and fluorescence emission based spectroscopic characteristics may be variously correlated with changes in genotoxicity in ozonated effluents however no associations were obtained in chlorinated wastewater effluents the bacterial response to the developed mechanism specific toxicity differs among wastewater effluents reflecting variability in effluent compositions graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorination ozonation

2009 multiple studies highlighted the formation of different types of dbps and their toxicity on various in vivo and in vitro models deng et al 2014 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2007 monarca et al 2004 stalter et al 2016 toxicity of disinfected water may be characterized using biomonitoring of daphnia fishes metazoans allium cepa mussels and mouse models da costa et al 2014 egito et al 2007 minissi et al 1996 monarca et al 2002 stalter et al 2010 vasseur and lasne 2012 however such assays are time consuming and require large sample quantities krewski et al 2009 the chinese hamster ovary cho cell lines are used as a selective biomonitoring tool for evaluating the toxicity of water samples plewa et al 2010 2004 2007 2008a but it requires 100 1000 fold concentrated samples and understanding the exact toxicity mechanisms is difficult using single growth inhibition assay in addition the use of natural bioluminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri received much attention as a model system to assess the toxicity of disinfected waters with commercially available test kits such as microtox lumistox biotox toxalert applitox and deltatox which measure the inhibition of bacterial luminescence light off upon exposure bayo et al 2009 emmanuel et al 2004 ma et al 2016 monarca et al 2004 park and choi 2017 however these model systems using natural bacteria bioluminescence fail also to measure the specific mode of toxicity such as genotoxicity cytotoxicity mutagenic and ros stresses induced by disinfected water nieuwenhuijsen et al 2009a 2009b plewa et al 2010 besides cyanobacteria have also been accepted as common toxicity indicators of the aquatic ecological web oecd 2011 iso 1989 previous studies supported the utilization of few algal species like pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and tetraselmis marina for examining the toxicity of disinfected and raw waters chhetri et al 2017 liu and zhang 2014 yang et al 2015 the sos chromotest quillardet et al 1982 umuc oda et al 1985 and ames tests maron and ames 1983 were suggested as sensitive reporter gene methods for detection of mutagenicity and genotoxicity in various disinfected waters kargalioglu et al 2002 zeng et al 2015 guzzella et al 2006 zani et al 2005 by measuring the induction of β galactosidase these tests are based on the response of bacterial strains escherichia coli sos chromotest pq37 sfia lacz salmonella typhimurium umuc ta1535 psk1002 and salmonella typhimurium ames ta100 ta98 exhibiting lacz reporter gene to mutagenic and genotoxic agents the response of lacz reporter gene against toxicity is measured with chromogenic substrates by the enzymatic transformation however the color interference may appear between substrate and samples mersch sundermann et al 1994 and the β galactosidase is highly stable hogness et al 1955 even after loss of cell viability thus limiting the application of these tests instead using recombinant dna techniques non luminescent bacterial strains i e e coli can be engineered with vibrio fischeri lux operon without the exogenous substrate engebrecht et al 1985 these recombinant bacteria are constructed in such a way that promoter genes for the specific stress responses associated with dna damage genotoxicity oxidative stress protein damage cytotoxicity are coupled with bacteria to express bioluminescence genes for luciferase lux as a toxicity bio reporter belkin et al 1997 these genetically modified bacteria exhibit low baseline luminescence which increases after exposure to toxic compounds lights on effect the engineered bioluminescence bacteria dpd2794 vollmer et al 1997 grpe van dyk et al 1994 and micf belkin et al 1997 provide rapid differential and easily measurable responses towards specific stress mechanisms such as genotoxicity cytotoxicity and ros generation as compared with natural non specific bioluminescence of bacteria vibrio fischeri even though genetically modified bacterial strains capable of responding to specific toxicity mechanisms were used previously eltzov et al 2009 eltzov et al 2015b 2015c zani et al 2005 there were no studies highlighting their differential response to the toxicity of variously chlorinated and ozonated wastewater effluents therefore the primary aim of this study was to characterize the development of toxicity of wastewater effluents during different disinfection procedures involving chlorination or ozonation using genetically modified bioluminescence bacteria with specific reporter genes responding to cytotoxicity genotoxicity and ros generation one expectation was that the formation of toxic dbps during chlorination will make itself evident in enhanced bioluminescence thus helping also to elucidate the roles of chlorine concentration and treatment time in the toxicity development the second expectation was that decomposition of nom due to ozonation is associated with a decrease in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity which may be quantified using response specific strains considering common use of cyanobacteria for examining the toxicity of disinfected and raw waters the second aim of this research was to compare the sensitivity of cyanobacteria spirulina sp vs bioluminescent bacteria in evaluating dynamics of toxicity development during chlorination and ozonation of treated wastewater effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1

characterization secondarily treated wastewater effluents were obtained from three different municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps and tagged as w1 w2 and w3 henceforth the effluents w1 and w2 were collected from mwtps located in raanana and kibbutz yagur respectively the third effluent w3 was obtained from the largest israeli mwtp shafdan situated in rishon lezion wastewater samples from all the three mwtps were after primary filtration and activated sludge treatment and did not pass chlorination wastewater effluent samples were collected in the sterile 10 l vessels and transferred to the laboratory within a few hours further the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm glass filter whatman to remove suspended material and stored at 4 c to minimize any changes filtered wastewater effluent samples were characterized with ph electric conductivity ec bante instruments dds 12dw conductivity meter and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations determined with toc l rohs shimadzu bromide concentration was measured with high performance ion chromatography dionex ics 2500 column as4a sc eluting bicarbonate buffer gp 50 gradient pump absorbance at 254 nm abs254 and fluorescence of filtered treated wastewater samples were also measured as detailed in supplementary information s1 2 3 chlorination and ozonation of wastewater chlorination commercial sodium hypochlorite solution naocl was used for the preparation of chlorinating agent this solution was diluted and the actual concentration of ocl was determined spectrophotometrically with thermo scientific genesys 10 by measuring the absorbance at 292 nm ε 362 m 1 cm 1 chen 1967 then the stock solution of 500 mg l 1 was used to prepare working concentrations of 1 and 10 mg l 1 for chlorination of wastewater samples chlorination was performed in headspace free amber glass bottles by incubating in the dark at 26 c in incubator shaker si 300 r lab companion for different contact times of 0 5 1 2 4 8 24 and 72 h respectively after each contact time the residual chlorine concentrations were determined using dpd free chlorine reagent by measuring spectrophotometrically absorbance of formed würster dye color at 510 nm palin 1957 residual chlorine concentrations were quantified using a calibration curve of known standard concentrations between 0 05 and 10 mg l 1 finally residual chlorine concentrations were stoichiometrically quenched with 0 1 m sodium thiosulfate ozonation the aquazone plus 50 instrument producing 50 mg of ozone per hour and equipped with the air supplier aqua serene air pump as 1061 was used to perform water ozonation air from the pump was dried by passing through a glass cylinder containing silica beads in a control experiment the generated o3 was sparged using 15 μm micro pore aerator through 100 ml of milli q water for 100 min during ozone purging the sample beaker containing water was placed in the ice bucket to enhance the ozone solubility and reduce the ozone decay the concentration of dissolved o3 was quantified in the 3 ml samples obtained at every 10 min intervals by potassium indigo trisulfonate method bader and hoigné 1981 for that absorbance at 600 nm was measured and ozone concentration was calculated following bader and hoigné 1981 based on the absorbance difference between the ozonated sample and blank solution the concentration of dissolved o3 was about 3 4 mg l 1 throughout the period of ozonation the same protocol of ozonation was applied for the treatment of wastewater effluents for different selected times no residual ozone was detected in treated wastewater effluent samples after treatment characterization chlorinated and quenched and ozonated effluent samples were characterized for ph ec and doc concentrations as described above absorbance at 254 nm abs254 specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva and fluorescence were also determined detailed in supplementary information s1 absorbance and fluorescence measurements at the wavelengths of interest were also tested in the control solutions containing 10 mg l 1 of chlorine and stoichiometrically quenched with sodium thiosulfate based on the control tests no contribution was expected from the products of quenching into light absorption and fluorescence of samples 2 4 wastewater toxicity characterized by genetically modified bioluminescent bacteria three different genetically modified bioluminescent bacteria named dpd2794 grpe and micf obtained as a gift from prof sh belkin hebrew university of jerusalem israel were used to examine the toxicity of sampled filtered chlorinated and ozonated wastewaters more details about the bioluminescent bacteria used are provided in supplementary information s2 these genetically modified bacterial strains were grown overnight on lb agar with 50 μg l 1 of ampicillin in order to maintain the plasmid in cells belkin et al 1997 at 37 c further a single isolated colony from lb agar plate was inoculated in 5 ml sterile lb broth containing 5 μg l 1 of ampicillin and kept at 37 c in shaking incubator gerhardt konigswinter germany at 120 rpm overnight eltzov et al 2009 2015 next day 250 μl of grown culture was inoculated in 25 ml of sterile lb broth and incubated at 30 c for nearly 5 h without shaking until it reached 0 2 units of absorbance measured in a 1 cm quartz cuvette at 600 nm thermo scientific genesys 10 uv vis spectrophotometer later the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 c and the pellet was re suspended with fresh lb broth and adjusted to the absorbance of 1 0 an analyzed water sample 160 μl was exposed to 40 μl of bacterial culture with the absorbance of 1 0 making the final water concentration as such as 80 of the initial ones and the bacterial culture with the absorbance of 0 2 in 96 well white plates bacterial culture and millipore water mixed in the same 1 to 4 proportion as analyzed water samples served as a control the luminescence values were measured as relative light units using microplate luminometer perkinelmer enspire 2300 multilabel reader at 26 c for every 5 min till 10 h the induction of luminescence of bacterial strain in response to the toxicity of water sample was indicated as if induction factor if relative luminescence of test sample relative luminescence of control the induction factor above 2 was considered as the definite toxicity induction pattern harpaz et al 2018 all the experiments were accomplished in triplicates the potential effect of salinity of the source chlorinated and ozonated samples on the bioluminescent bacteria was tested vs deionized millipore water served as a control with the nacl solution at a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 fig s5 supplementary information the additional test was performed in the deionized millipore water chlorinated with 10 mg l 1 of chlorine for 1 24 and 72 h and then stoichiometrically quenched with sodium thiosulfate fig s6 supplementary information this latter test was intended to examine a contribution from the salt background formed during chlorination quenching and the role of possibly non fully quenched residual chlorine present in the sample on bioluminescence the details of these tests including the selection of nacl concentration are provided in supplementary information s3 2 5 wastewater toxicity characterized by cyanobacteria a spirulina arthrospira platensis culture was used as a model organism to examine the toxicity of sampled filtered chlorinated and ozonated wastewaters the rapid in vivo fluorescence method was used to measure pigment content gregor and maršálek 2005 and to track the growth of cyanobacteria davidson 1991 bhuvaneshwari et al 2015 spirulina culture was grown in sp medium spirulina medium bg 11 in algal growth chamber equipped with white led lamps 30 μmol photons m 2 sec 1 at 24 c under 16 8 light dark photoperiod conditions cells were harvested at the exponential phase of growth by centrifuging at 6000 rpm for 10 min and washed with fresh sp medium for toxicity experiments 200 μl of spirulina culture with constant initial phycocyanine fluorescence intensity of 35000 a u corresponding to unit absorbance was exposed to 800 μl of a water sample in 48 well plates diluting water samples by 20 control group was prepared by using spirulina culture with sp medium instead of analyzed water samples the changes in phycocyanine contents of algal cells exposed to tested water were quantified using elisa plate reader biotek synergy neo2 multimode reader by measuring the fluorescence intensity upon excitation at 590 nm and emission at 650 nm phycocyanine for every 24 h till three days all the experiments were performed in triplicates the salinity effect was also tested by growing algae both in a 1000 mg l 1 nacl solution and in deionized millipore water chlorinated with 10 mg l 1 of chlorine for 1 24 and 72 h and then stoichiometrically quenched with sodium thiosulfate as with bioluminescent bacteria details in supplementary information s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of chlorination and ozonation on selected effluent characteristics measurements of abs254 fluorescence and doc concentrations in water samples are helpful to examine the effects of disinfection agents on effluent components and foremost om since changes in ph and ec of treated wastewater samples due to chlorination followed by quenching or ozonation were minimal if at all fig s4 a d these solution properties could not interfere with an examination of spectroscopic indices across the treatment fig 1 shows changes in abs254 of all three types of wastewater effluents in response to chlorination time at different applied chlorine concentrations 1 and 10 mg l 1 after quenching residual chlorine with sodium thiosulfate since abs254 is linked to the presence of aromatic compounds weishaar et al 2003 zsolnay and steindl 1991 its reduction suggests degradation of some aromatic structures in om or the loss of specific absorptivity due to chlorination increasing chlorine concentration led to a stronger decrease in abs254 of samples w1 and w3 thus suggesting larger extents of changes of aromatic components surprisingly treatment of effluent w2 with increased chlorine concentration 10 mg l 1 led to a slight but detectable increase of absorbance when comparing with the 1 mg l 1 treatment this may be understood as an indication of the formation of some products characterized by specific absorptivity larger than that of initial om components increased absorptivity may be caused by electronic effects of substituents in chlorinated om components for example chlorophenols are commonly produced at low levels during the interaction of chlorine with natural water constituents lee and morris 1962 wajon et al 1982 nist chemistry webbook 2019 reports log molar absorptivity of p chlorophenol at 254 nm slightly higher than that of phenol i e 2 75 vs 2 4 a slight increase in absorbance with the incorporation of chlorine was observed for other phenolic compounds e g resorcinol li et al 2000 beauchamp et al 2019 when fluorescence was examined in wastewater effluent solutions across chlorination treatments it was found to be affected by chlorination even less in some cases with no effective changes compared to non chlorinated effluents fig s1 also there were no notable changes in doc even at 10 mg l 1 of chlorine used fig s2a similar to our observation kim and yu 2005 reported that chlorination could induce significant changes in the chemistry of om while with a minor change in its concentration in contrast ozonation had a strong reducing effect on absorbance and fluorescence of effluents fig 2 others have also shown the reducing effect of ozonation on abs254 of wastewater effluents hua et al 2006 mao et al 2014 which was linked to cleavage of aromatic carbon carbon bonds von gunten 2003 however doc was remained unchanged fig s3a demonstrating that ozonation was not effective to abate doc in agreement with mao et al 2014 the suva of source wastewater effluents was about 1 5 1 3 and 1 7 l mg 1 m 1 indicating moderate aromaticity i e 2 3 l mg 1 m 1 ates et al 2007 but the 100 min ozonation decreased the suva of effluents w1 w2 and w3 by factors of 2 30 1 54 and 2 86 respectively thus bringing it below 1 l mg 1 m 1 indicative of the relatively low om aromaticity fig s3b fluorescence changes due to ozonation fig 2b and c were even more significant than the abs254 changes fig 2a for example after ozonation for 100 min the maximal fluorescence determined upon excitation at 335 nm fig 2b decreased by 91 81 and 94 for w1 w2 and w3 respectively as compared with intensities measured in non ozonated effluents fluorescence measured at excitation emission wavelengths nm 300 380 400 450 and 220 250 320 370 fig 2b and c is associated with humic like and proteinaceous structures respectively coble 1996 sierra et al 2005 this suggests that ozonation succeeded to effectively degrade some humic like and proteinaceous components present in the wastewater effluents examined to summarize chlorination and ozonation of the treated wastewater effluents studied had no effect on doc concentrations but had variable impacts on the presence of uv absorbing aromatic compounds and fluorophores chlorination mostly affected compounds absorbing at 254 nm as compared with fluorescent components whereas ozone was especially successful in decomposing fluorescent constituents ec and ph of water samples both ozonated and chlorinated and then quenched are not the factors which could induce the changes in algal growth or bioluminescence of bacteria exposed to effluents after different disinfection treatments 3 2 toxicity of chlorinated wastewater effluents probed with bioluminescent bacteria 3 2 1 genotoxicity assessment fig 3 a b c reports the bioluminescence ifs of genotoxicity sensitive bacteria in each of three effluents w1 w2 and w3 against chlorination time at two chlorine concentrations applied these ifs represent the bioluminescence measured in a test sample and normalized by that value determined in a control where the control was prepared by mixing the bacteria culture with deionized millipore water instead of test solution the details are in materials and methods it is clear from fig 3 a c that the 0 45 μm filtered wastewater effluents were genotoxic prior to any disinfection the induction factor values were in the order of w1 w3 w2 with the if 21 5 1 1 13 8 2 2 and 6 1 0 5 respectively fig 3a c the major effects in effluent genotoxicity in fig 3 a c were not related to salt induced stress since the salinity tests described in section s3 of supplementary information showed the if values not exceeding 2 figs s5 and s6 in supplementary information chlorinated w1 was always significantly less genotoxic compared to non treated w1 fig 3a treatment with 10 mg l 1 of chlorine for 72 h removed the genotoxicity of effluent w1 by 75 cao et al 2009 observed the 28 reduction in wastewater effluent toxicity treated by the same chlorine concentration determined using sos umu bioassay wu et al 2010 reported the 10 decrease in toxicity values of chlorinated wastewater compared to non chlorinated samples by sos umu bioassay the if in the chlorinated w1 effluent fig 3a was increased with the concentration of initially added chlorine at all kinetics intervals except the longest one 72 h since quenching in our experimental protocols removed the residual chlorine remaining in effluents the observed pattern suggests that the increasing chlorine concentration increases the genotoxicity potential by the production of dbps as the contact time of chlorination increases at 1 mg l 1 of chlorine production of dbps increases the genotoxicity response of effluent w1 fig 3a and eventually reaches a steady state from 8 h if 5 6 0 7 to 72 h if 4 9 1 5 application of higher chlorine concentration 10 mg l 1 showed a time dependent increase in if and further a decrease remarkably at 72 h the treatments of effluent w1 using two different chlorine concentrations led to the similar if fig 3a this is suggestive for the interplay between the enhanced formation of genotoxic substances at the higher chlorine concentration 10 mg l 1 and their disappearance due to either volatilization or degradation monarca et al 2000 xie and reckhow 1993 as an example haloacetamides hams exhibiting higher genotoxicity potential than other dbp types plewa et al 2008a can further decompose in the presence of chlorine to form less genotoxic n cl hams and finally haloacetic acids ding et al 2018 in contrast to w1 which was always significantly less genotoxic upon chlorination compared to non treated effluent fig 3a wastewater effluent w2 became generally more genotoxic upon chlorination fig 3b the genotoxicity rise in effluent w2 was chlorine dose dependent non chlorinated w3 similar to w1 was capable of significant genotoxicity fig 3c treatment of w3 with 1 mg l 1 of chlorine at any contact time reduced the genotoxicity of effluent samples obviously higher chlorine concentrations applied to effluent w3 led to the higher ifs values in all contact times fig 3c it may be noted that in all the treatment experiments residual concentrations of chlorine before quenching were detectable fig s8 experimenting with all the three wastewater effluents showed that i generally increase in concentration of chlorine increases the genotoxicity potential of chlorinated wastewater effluents and ii higher chlorine concentration applied tends to produce a bell shaped dependence of genotoxicity on the chlorination time with the initial if increase followed by a decreasing trend at a lower chlorine concentration used there is rather a saturation trend of genotoxicity with the treatment time most probably at the higher chlorine concentration concentrations of genotoxic dbps are also higher however at higher chlorine concentrations dbps might undergo some further transformations making them less toxic or just disappear from the system these results highlight that the chlorinated wastewater effluents possess dna damaging properties depending on chlorine dose and treatment time ohe et al 2004 reported that organic compounds in chlorinated water could induce frame shift mutation by ta 100 salmonella typhimurium strains other studies also showed the genotoxicity potential of chlorinated waters causing chromosomal aberrations frame shift mutation dna stand breaks using bacteria kargalioglu et al 2002 lv et al 2015 liu et al 2010 monarca et al 2000 cell lines yuan et al 2005 buschini et al 2004 human white blood cells maffei et al 2005 the variation in genotoxicity potential between three wastewater effluents observed in our study emphasizes the role of effluent composition our observations support the findings of dong et al 2017 that the production of dbps and their genotoxicity depend on the source chemical characteristics of water samples and type of disinfection agent used strong correlations between genotoxicity and some water parameters were also noted lv et al 2015 wang et al 2011 however we found no correlations between the if values and absorbance fluorescence and doc concentrations of water samples both non treated and chlorinated 3 2 2 cytotoxicity assessment fig 3 d f shows the factors of bioluminescence induction of the bacteria responding to cytotoxicity the first two effluents prior to chlorination showed a similar induction factor which was 1 8 fold lesser than that shown by third effluent 7 8 0 5 thus revealing the relatively lower cytotoxicity of w1 and w2 compared to w3 the if values of all three wastewater effluents at various chlorination times were higher than the ifs in the salinity testing experiments examining possible salt induced stress supplementary information figs s5 s6 and s7 section s3 upon w1 chlorination fig 3d 1 mg l 1 of chlorine there was a time dependent increase in if till 4 h and further it followed the decreasing trend the 10 mg l 1 chlorine concentration applied to the w1 effluent resulted in a drastic initial increase in if by 2 4 fold from the non chlorinated w1 effluent and a further increase in contact time decreased the cytotoxicity potential while it was always more than that of the non chlorinated w1 effluent the second wastewater effluent w2 fig 3e treated with 1 mg l 1 of chlorine did not show meaningful changes in induction factor as compared with the non chlorinated effluent while the elevated chlorine concentration 10 mg l 1 brought a substantial if increase at 1 h and remained steady state till 24 h before it decreases at 72 h coming to the third effluent fig 3f there is the development of cytotoxicity depending on the chlorination time for both chlorine concentrations applied also similarly to the genotoxicity response the higher chlorine concentration used led to generally increased bioluminescence thus indicating enhanced cytotoxicity these findings imply that chlorinated effluents caused a substantial change in the cellular metabolism of bacteria as a result of cytotoxicity the exact cytotoxicity mechanisms exerted by chlorinated dbps in disinfected waters are still not entirely clear but the reports strongly support that the inhibition of gadph glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase mediated glycolytic pathways can cause mitochondrial damage dad et al 2013 pals et al 2011 also limiting the cellular atp levels and metabolism ldh lactate dehydrogenase leakage gsh reduced glutathione decrease and accumulation of mda malondialdehyde level induce intracellular oxidative stress park and choi 2017 yuan et al 2005 thus finally causing cytotoxicity obviously dbps may differ in the mechanisms of their toxicity towards the target test organisms cortés and marcos 2018 also cytotoxicity associated ifs did not reveal associations with available data on doc absorbance and fluorescence of wastewater effluents 3 2 3 oxidative stress assessment when examining oxidative stress response to the possible ros generation fig 3g i the effect of wastewater effluents was small and non specific the comparable if values were obtained in all the three non chlorinated effluents chlorine concentration had no distinct effect on the development of ifs in the all three effluent samples and the effect of the time was very modest if at all except elevated toxicity for w1 and w3 at 4 h of chlorination therefore the chlorination did not involve distinct ros generated toxicity in our experiments though ros is known to play a significant role in the inactivation of microbial pathogens during disinfection due to its 105 times lower ct concentration multiplied by time compared to active chlorine and higher oxidation potential cho et al 2004a b most probably this is caused by the disappearance of ros from the system before testing the water sample toxicity 3 3 toxicity of ozonated wastewater effluents probed with bioluminescent bacteria one of the major concerns associated with water disinfection by ozonation is the ros production the formation of dbps pals et al 2013 or there could be an effective transformation of unknown products which contributes to certain toxic effects de vera et al 2015 fig 4 examines the changes in bacterial bioluminescence sensitive to genotoxicity cytotoxicity and ros upon ozonation of three wastewater effluents studied being a powerful oxidizing agent ozone strongly decreases the genotoxicity potential of w1 and w3 effluents by 8 9 and 5 4 fold at 100 min of treatment compared to non ozonated water fig 4a however w2 did not show strong differences in genotoxicity between ozonated and non ozonated effluents at all interaction time even though ozonation intensely degrades the uv absorbing and fluorescing om in w2 fig 2 it did not eliminate the genotoxic compounds present in this effluent fig 4a in fact it is known that multiple organic compounds present in wastewater may be stable against oxidation with ozone brunet et al 1984 and therefore the persistent toxicity might be well understood in the case of treating w1 and w3 with ozone the ifs decreasing with ozonation time strongly positively correlated with concurrent abs254 values r2 0 996 p 0 00001 and r2 0 918 p 0 00001 respectively the positive correlations were also found for genotoxicity ifs of w1 and w3 with fluorescence emission of humic like substances r2 0 971 p 0 00005 and r2 0 760 p 0 1057 respectively and of proteinaceous like substances r2 0 947 p 0 0002 and r2 0 595 p 0 042 respectively each correlation involved 21 points i e 7 triplicated values the fact that the genotoxicity potential of w1 and w3 i e if across the ozonation treatment correlated stronger with absorbance than with fluorescence may indicate that i uv absorbing constituents rather than the fluorescing ones are associated with genotoxicity or ii genotoxic components have similar degradability under ozone treatment as uv absorbing om the observed correlations suggest that abs254 and fluorescence emission might have a certain potential to serve as predictors for removal of genotoxic compounds in disinfected water in contrast the genotoxicity of w2 fig 4a showed statistically significant negative correlations with abs254 and fluorescence emission at the two maxima r2 0 844 p 0 0034 with abs254 r2 0 617 p 0 036 with humic like fluorescence and r2 0 660 p 0 026 with proteinaceous like fluorescence the negative correlations observed in effluent w2 may be explained by the formation of genotoxic substances associated with disappearance of less toxic chromophoric and fluorophoric precursors alternatively formation of genotoxic compounds may occur just in parallel with the decline in absorbance and fluorescence in the ozonation course since bromide was detected in the source wastewater effluents w1 w2 and w3 at concentrations of 470 220 and 480 μg l 1 ozonation might lead to the formation of bro3 which is genotoxic kurokawa et al 1986 lin et al 2014 reported that a steady increase in bro3 production leads to the formation of brominated dbps daiber et al 2016 muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008b and richardson et al 2010 reported that brominated dbps are relatively more genotoxic mutagenic than chlorinated dbps although the formation of bromate and brominated dbps could occur during ozonation of the effluents yet the whole genotoxic potential of w1 and w3 demonstrated a monotonous decline with ozonation time fig 4a hence either bromide associated induction of genotoxicity was negligible in these effluents or it was outweighed by the disappearance of other genotoxic constituents present in solution and undergoing oxidation and decomposition along the ozonation the second option might be supported by the data in w2 effluent in which a modest temporal rise in genotoxicity was observed fig 4a if this genotoxicity rise in w2 effluent is thought to be associated with the initial presence of bromide in solution then even a larger temporal genotoxicity increase should be expected in effluents w1 and w3 in which bromide concentration was greater as compared with w2 by a factor exceeding 2 since it did not happen in w1 and w3 fig 4a some other genotoxic constituents might disappear along ozonation cytotoxicity of wastewater effluent w1 was slightly decreased upon ozonation but eventually leading to the elevated if as compared to that of non ozonated effluent fig 4b also treating w2 with ozone led to slightly increased cytotoxicity formation of cytotoxic constituents due to wastewater effluent ozonation is very clear in the case of w3 specifically the cytotoxic potential expressed in the if of the w3 wastewater effluent ozonated for 100 min was 1 9 and 1 3 fold more than that one established for non ozonated w3 fig 4b and w3 treated by chlorine at the 10 mg l 1 concentration for 72 h fig 3f thus the cytotoxic effect of ozonated wastewater may be significant ros stress response to ozonation was very similar for all three wastewater effluents at all time intervals except for the w2 at 100 min fig 4c this result clearly states that wastewater effluent ozonation does not involve toxicity response associated with ros production which may be explained by the disappearance of short living and active ros 3 4 toxicity of wastewater effluents probed with cyanobacteria spirulina strain to address a second goal of the study cyanobacteria spirulina sp was tested to characterize the toxicity of the wastewater effluents undergoing chlorination or ozonation and the cyanobacteria response was compared with that of bioluminescent bacteria 3 4 1 effect of wastewater effluent chlorination on cyanobacteria spirulina strain fig 5 reports the measures quantifying phycocyanine pigment contents in spirulina sp exposed to variously chlorinated wastewater effluents in relative to the growth control in sp medium the data is grouped for a given effluent w1 w2 or w3 and certain growing time 0 24 48 and 72 h such that each group presents the relative pigment contents in wastewater effluent samples chlorinated for 0 0 5 1 2 4 8 24 and 72 h with the chlorine concentrations of 1 and 10 mg l 1 non chlorinated wastewater effluent w1 itself reduces the algal phycocyanine fluorescence by 55 within 24 h of algal growth followed by an 85 90 decrease at 72 h fig 5a this reduction was not associated with effluent salinity effect which was tested by growing cyanobacteria in a 1000 mg l 1 nacl solution section s3 in supplementary information there was no decrease in phycocyanine content of algal cells exposed to this nacl concentration as compared with the algal growth in the control sp medium lua and vonshak 2002 reported that presence of nacl at concentrations below 0 2 m 11700 mg l 1 did not affect the psii electron transfer from qa to qb photosystem ii photosynthetic oxygen evolution phycocyanine and chlorophyll content growth and biomass of spirulina according to sharma et al 2014 exposure of 0 4 m nacl significantly increases the phycocyanine pigment of spirulina platensis compared to that of the control group there was no difference in the pigment content of algae exposed for 24 h between chlorinated w1 1 mg l 1 of chlorine for different contact times and the non chlorinated ones when the chlorine concentration applied was 10 mg l 1 the pigment content in the algae exposed to the chlorinated w1 for 24 h even increased as compared with that of algae exposed to non chlorinated w1 fig 5a this may be understood as an indication that the effluent om is itself the factor reducing algae growth and the treatment with the higher chlorine dosage reduces concentrations of some aromatic om components fig 1 that may be toxic and in this way chlorination at higher dosage stimulated the growth at 48 and 72 h of algae exposure no matter whether the wastewater effluent w1 was chlorinated or not it showed a complete loss of phycocyanine fluorescence fig 5a and bleaching fig s9 w1 it appears that cyanobacterial growth was not sensitive to wastewater effluent w1 toxicity induced by chlorination as distinct from the marked effect of chlorination and chlorine concentration on the activity of bioluminescent bacteria fig 3a d in the case of w2 and w3 both chlorinated and non chlorinated wastewater effluents were hardly distinguishable in terms of pigment content except the 24 h exposure at this time interval there was a 20 30 decrease at some combinations of chlorine concentration mg l 1 chlorination time h fig 5b and c the series 1 72 10 0 5 10 1 and 10 2 at this 24 h exposure time longest chlorination duration i e 72 h or elevated chlorine concentrations 10 mg l 1 were needed to make toxicity of chlorinated wastewater effluent detectable with algae however when both higher chlorine dosage and longer contact times were applied the growth inhibition tended to be less thus again suggesting chlorination induced decomposition of some effluent components capable of being toxic for algae when using bioluminescent bacteria less chlorination time was needed to produce detectable toxicity which was observable after application of the lowest chlorine dose 1 mg l 1 fig 3 one reason contributing to lesser sensitivity of cyanobacteria to the formation of toxic dbps as compared to bioluminescent bacteria could be hypothesized to reflect the differences in the cell wall structure despite their overall prokaryotic gram negative nature thick peptidoglycan layers and multilayered membranes in the cyanobacteria cell walls hoiczyk and hansel 2000 may act as a mechanical and permeability barrier against toxicants yu et al 2014 3 4 2 effect of wastewater effluent ozonation on cyanobacteria spirulina strain the effects of wastewater effluent ozonation are demonstrated in fig 6 which shows phycocyanine pigment fluorescence in relative to the control in sp medium in cyanobacteria spirulina exposed for different times to variously ozonated effluents w1 w2 and w3 when spirulina was exposed to w1 for 24 h fig 6a initial ozonation of wastewater effluent reduced toxicity and increased pigment fluorescence in line with significant degradation of uv absorbing and fluorescent om in w1 fig 2 however ozonation exceeding 30 min even not leading to significant advanced degradation of om fig 2 induced toxicity trend with ozonation time fig 6a some similarity could be seen in this response to the if changes of the cytotoxicity sensitive bacteria exposed to ozonated w1 fig 4b where initial ozonation reduced effluent w1 toxicity but the advanced ozonation led eventually to its increase further there was strong inhibition of phycocyanine fluorescence by 90 at 48 and 72 h of exposure to w1 regardless of ozonation treating w2 with ozone did not significantly alternate the phycocyanine fluorescence of algal cells after 24 h exposure fig 6b also prolonged exposure of algae to wastewater effluent w2 did not reveal strong effects of ozonation however some increases of pigment fluorescence i e decreases of toxicity with ozonation time might be figured out for algae exposed to wastewater effluent for 48 and 72 h in contrast to algae there were indications for elevated geno cyto and ros associated toxicities towards bioluminescent bacteria in ozonated w2 effluent fig 4 treating w3 with ozone for 10 min decreased the pigment fluorescence by less than 25 compared to that in the non ozonated effluent at all days of algae exposure whereas extended ozonation time had either no any effect for 24 h exposure of algae or revealed a slight positive effect on pigment content i e decrease of toxicity when exposure times were 48 and 72 h when comparing with bacterial bioluminescence responses genotoxicity probing bacteria revealed the distinct decrease of w3 toxicity with ozonation time fig 4a and cytotoxicity sensitive bacteria detected a marked continuous increase of toxicity fig 4b there were no correlations found between water parameters i e abs254 and fluorescence and changes in phycocyanine fluorescence of algal cells at all growth times 24 48 and 72 h concentrations of chlorine and contact times of chlorination and ozonation followed 4 conclusions as the test systems used to assess the toxicity of chlorinated and ozonated wastewater effluents the genetically engineered bioluminescent bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to the effluent treatment with disinfecting agents by responding to chlorine concentration applied chlorination and ozonation times changes in bacteria bioluminescence suggest alterations in dna damaging properties of chlorinated wastewater effluents i e genotoxic potential and the cellular metabolism of bacteria i e cytotoxic potential chlorination induced time dependent development of geno and cytotoxicity is enhanced at an elevated chlorine concentration yet declining at prolonged treatment the detailed bioluminescence response to the induced toxicity depends on the type of toxicity mechanism and varies among wastewater effluents emphasizing the role of effluent composition depending on the wastewater effluent genotoxicity may be suppressed by ozonation or be hardly sensitive to that whereas the cytotoxic potential of wastewater effluents may distinctly increase with ozonation time thus variable responses of geno and cytotoxicity of wastewater effluents to ozonation time may be revealed with mechanism specific bioluminescence bacteria no correlations could be found between changes in the geno and cytotoxic potential of chlorinated wastewater effluents and absorbance at 254 nm fluorescence and doc concentrations of water samples in contrast statistically significant correlations were obtained between genotoxicity in differently ozonated effluents and such effluent properties as absorbance and fluorescence intensity associated with humic like and proteinaceous om these correlations in ozonated effluents may suggest a possibility to use spectroscopic parameters as predictors for the removal of toxic compounds in ozonated water bioluminescent bacteria are susceptible and sensitive as compared to cyanobacterial spirulina sp also providing mechanism specific responses associated with genotoxicity cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species generation in wastewater effluents when using bioluminescent bacteria less chlorination time or chlorine concentration were needed to produce detectable toxicity genetically modified bioluminescent bacteria could be the sensitive tool to study the risk posed by dbps production during chlorination and ozonation of water funding this work was

18543,increasing studies indicate that magnetite addition could accelerate the methanogenesis via enhancing direct interspecies electron transfer diet based anaerobic syntrophy however magnetite is found to run off in continuous bioreactor and the effect of magnetite loss on syntrophic aggregates is still underreported in this study two egsb reactors rm with magnetite enhanced sludge and rb as a control were operated to investigate the magnetite behavior in continuous bioreactor and the corresponding response of syntrophic aggregates results showed that magnetite in rm was washed out gradually in form of iron ions and a slightly acidic niche was supposed to be the major cause nevertheless candidate diet partners like geobacter and methanothrix along with syntrophic volatile fatty acids vfas degrading microbes were enriched in rm in addition the improved redox activity of extracellular polymeric substance eps higher sludge conductivity and electron transport activity suggested that the diet ability of sludge in rm was still enhanced which favors the syntrophic metabolism of vfas interestingly syntrophic partners were loosely combined under the condition of high organic loading rate olr in the presence of magnetite but with gradual loss of magnetite dense and active anaerobic granular sludge ags was formed in rm this study provided a comprehensive understanding of magnetite behavior in continuous bioreactor and the response of syntrophic aggregates the robust diet based syntrophy after magnetite adding could favor the high efficient anaerobic wastewater treatment and resource recovery in the future and further investigations on magnetite resupply and the mechanism of magnetite enriching candidate diet partners are recommended graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic bioreactor magnetite behavior anaerobic granular sludge ags syntrophic metabolism direct interspecies electron transfer diet 1 introduction anaerobic syntrophy is an essential intermediary step in the anaerobic conversion of organic matter into methane where syntrophic microorganisms are linked tightly by the need of maintaining the exchanged metabolites at low concentrations morris et al 2013 actually cooperative partners in natural environments often form multi species aggregates it was theoretically suggested that close physical contact between syntrophic microbes such as volatile fatty acids vfas fermenting syntrophic microbes and methanogens was important for efficient interspecies electron transfer iet ishii et al 2006 interspecies hydrogen transfer iht and interspecies formate transfer ift are well documented strategies for iet during the syntrophic metabolism sieber et al 2012 recently direct interspecies electron transfer diet was found to be an alternative to iht or ift during some syntrophic metabolism lovley 2017 diet could occur spontaneously between some anaerobic microbes via conductive pili summers et al 2010 or addition of various non biological conductive materials like magnetite and conductive carbon materials lovley 2017 morita et al 2011 reported that methanogenic aggregates were electrically conductive it seems that diet could be an important mechanism for electron exchange in syntrophic aggregates recently many studies have shown that addition of conductive materials could accelerate the rate of syntrophic metabolism of vfas via enhancing diet cruz viggi et al 2014 baek et al 2016 lovley 2017 however it is still unknown whether the enhanced diet could facilitate the formation of anaerobic granular sludge ags which is crucial to retain high biomass concentration and realize the stable operation of up flow bioreactor liu et al 2012 reported that addition of granular activated carbon gac could accelerate the metabolism of two diet partners geobacter metallireducens and geobacter sulfurreducens they observed that cells attached to gac but did not aggregate as they do when making biological electrical connections between cells besides chen et al 2014 addressed the impact of biochar on syntrophic associations based on diet and found that syntrophic cells attached to the biochar yet not in close contact both studies were based on batch experiments with addition of conductive carbon materials while the effect of conductive iron oxides addition on the formation of aggregates based on continuously operated up flow bioreactor is lack of research it should be noted that conductive iron oxides like magnetite could run off through effluent in continuous bioreactor and the response of syntrophic aggregates to magnetite loss is underreported in the present studies baek et al 2016 ambuchi et al 2017 particularly when treating industrial wastewater the performance of anaerobic reactor could be unstable due to the seasonal closure of industries or fluctuation of influent quality and quantity which could accelerate the dissolution and loss of magnetite it was reported that when the conductive carbon materials were removed rates of syntrophic metabolism of these reactors declined to rates comparable to the control reactor zhao et al 2015 whereas the effect of magnetite fade away on syntrophic metabolism during long term operation of reactor was unclear the exploration of magnetite behavior in anaerobic bioreactor and its effect on syntrophic aggregates could be vital for the application of magnetite enhanced anaerobic process this study encompassed a detailed investigation into the magnetite behavior and the corresponding response of syntrophic aggregates in egsb reactor the objectives of this study were 1 to explore the magnetite behavior in continuous anaerobic bioreactor 2 to reveal the functional microbial community succession in bioreactor with without magnetite and 3 to clarify the response of syntrophic aggregates to the magnetite behavior in terms of electron transfer characteristics and physicochemical characteristics of ags 2 materials and methods 2 1

to wang et al 2019 2 6 data analysis analysis of iron balance of rb and rm was performed and the detail was provided in the supporting information statistical analysis was conducted by the t test using spss spss 17 0 and significant differences were indicated as follows p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 3 results 3 1 performance of egsb reactors 3 1 1 cod removal efficiency as shown in fig 1 a the cod removal efficiency of rm dropped rapidly from 97 40 0 58 to 65 66 2 36 when hrt reduced from 12 h to 8 h and after hrt returned to 12 h that of rm recovered to 98 51 0 81 it was obviously that the performance of rm was sensitive to the hydraulic loading when keeping hrt at 12 h and increasing olr to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 the cod removal efficiency of rb dropped gradually while that of rm stabilized at 97 25 1 05 during the stage ii where hrt was kept at 12 h and olr of both reactors was increased from 4 kg cod m 3 d 1 to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 the cod removal efficiency of rm was higher than 95 while that of rb dropped gradually again and led to anaerobic digestion failure finally despite rm was sensitive to the hydraulic loading its olr tolerance was at least 33 33 higher than that of rb under the hrt of 12 h 3 1 2 biogas production result of biogas production was showed in fig 1 b the biogas production of rm dropped rapidly from 0 49 0 02 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 to 0 32 0 07 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 when the hrt reduced from 12 h to 8 h while that of rb stabilized at 0 46 0 02 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 however when the olr increased to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 stage i day 47 70 the biogas production of rb decreased gradually from 0 46 0 04 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 to 0 28 0 02 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 while that of rm stabilized at 0 45 0 05 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 during stage ii when the olr increased to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 the biogas production of rb declined again while that of rm was stable regueiro et al 2015 found that the active archaea decreased during organic overloading shock the declined biogas production of rb at olr of 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 could be attributed to the over load olr inhibited the metabolism of methanogens in contrast the stable biogas production of rm at olr of 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 suggested that the magnetite enhanced anaerobic system could reduce the inhibition of high load olr to methanogens the biogas composition during the normal operation of stage ii was analyzed fig s2 result showed that the methane proportion in rm was 58 14 4 40 slightly higher than that in rb 54 24 5 49 it was supposed that some methanogens were selectively enriched in rm which made a direct contribution to higher methane proportion in rm 3 1 3 variation of ph and vfas as shown in fig 1 c the influent ph was maintained at 8 30 0 19 while the effluent ph of two reactors was fluctuating specifically the effluent ph of rm decreased from 7 03 0 01 to 6 28 0 03 when the hrt reduced from 12 h to 8 h and after the hrt recovered to 12 h that of rm increased to 7 00 0 19 which favors the growth of methanogens although the effluent ph of rb was less affected by the hrt it was sensitive to the olr when the olr increased to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 stage i the effluent ph of rb decreased gradually to 6 06 0 04 during the stage ii the effluent ph of rb stabilized at 6 95 0 15 for day 71 115 and then dropped again when the olr reached 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 vfas as a key factor influencing the performance of anaerobic reactor was further detected during day 120 130 as shown in fig 1 d the accumulation of propionate and acetate in rb was the main cause of decreased ph particularly the propionate the conversion of propionate is thermodynamically unfavorable under the standard condition ch3ch2coo 2h2o ch3coo 3h2 co2 δg 76 1 kj mol 1 and when the aceticlastic methanogenesis was inhibited the reaction of acetate metabolized by bacteria into hydrogen is also thermodynamically unfavorable under the standard condition ch3coo 4h2o 4h2 2hco3 h δg 104 6 kj mol 1 however these reactions could be achieved via syntrophic interaction which keeps a low level hydrogen partial pressure demirel and scherer 2008 the accumulation of propionate and acetate suggested that the corresponding syntrophic microbes in rb might be deficient or inhibited in contrast the vfas concentration in rm stabilized at 225 56 50 06 mg l 1 as we know methanogens grow relatively slower and are less robust than acidogens the result of less vfas accumulation in rm indicated that the syntrophic metabolism rate of vfas could be enhanced by magnetite probably via building and enhancing the diet based syntrophy yin et al 2018 3 2 behavior of magnetite during the operation the concentrations of effluent ferrous and ferric ions of rb and rm were detected as shown in fig 2 a the concentrations of effluent ferrous and ferric ions of rb were negligible while those of rm were fluctuating obviously the highest iron ion concentration including ferrous and ferric ions in effluent of rm reached 32 49 0 30 mg l 1 the analysis of iron balance in both egsb reactors was performed fig s3 the input iron includes iron in the inoculated sludge and water and iron in the influent the total iron in the inoculated sludge and water of rb and rm were 0 45 0 03 g and 10 26 0 11 g respectively the influent brought in 0 395 0 001 g of iron ion for each reactor the output iron includes washed out iron via the effluent and residual iron in the reactor thereinto the accumulation of washed out iron via the effluent for rb and rm were 0 59 0 02 g and 9 37 0 22 g which accounted for 63 37 and 94 51 of total iron in rb and rm respectively xrd analysis was performed on the sludge collected from rb and rm at day 5 and day 130 as shown in fig 2 b sludge collected from rb contained silicon dioxide while sludge collected from rm contained silicon dioxide and magnetite in day 5 however the xrd peak patterns of rb and rm were similar in day 130 and no magnetite was found in sludge from rm at the same time the iron contents of the sludge from two reactors were measured by edx as shown in table 2 the iron contents of sludge in rb and rm were 0 01 wt and 0 32 wt respectively actually the iron content of inoculated sludge for rm was 23 15 wt these results together with the result of high iron ions concentration in effluent of rm indicated that the magnetite in rm was washed out in form of iron ions during the 130 day operation interestingly the elements of polyvalent metal cations such as al and ca were slightly enriched in rm while the na content was slightly higher in rb suanon et al 2016 also reported that addition of magnetite could regulate and control the mobilization of metals like cd co cu zn ni and cr during anaerobic digestion process the enrichment of polyvalent metal cations which favors the formation of ags could be relative to the addition of magnetite 3 3 analysis of microbial communities microbial communities were investigated by illumina masiq high throughput sequencing the objective was to assess the potential influence of magnetite and its dissolution on microbial community composition and identify key microorganisms involved in structural modifications of the microbiota 3 3 1 analysis of bacterial community for the bacterial community the alpha diversity indices were showed in table 3 higher alpha diversity indices in rm indicated that the magnetite addition could increase the bacterial abundance and diversity bacterial taxonomy results showed that the dominant phyla of the six sludge samples were candidatus saccharibacteria firmicutes actinobacteria bacteroidetes spirochaetes and proteobacteria fig 3 a candidatus saccharibacteria plays an important role in the degradation of various organics like sugar compounds under anaerobic condition kindaichi et al 2016 it was found that candidatus saccharibacteria in rb increased from 1 16 to 39 16 during the operation while that in rm increased from 7 23 to 42 67 and then decreased to 7 2 interestingly the abundance of spirochaetes in rm in day 130 reached 50 80 3 87 fold as that in rb 13 11 spirochaetes has been reported to have metabolic activities including acetate ethanol and lactate fermentations from glucose as well as the acetate oxidation lee et al 2015 the enrichment of spirochaetes in rm could play a crucial role in accelerating the degradation of vfas during the high olr operation the abundance of firmicutes a syntrophic bacteria degrading various substrates and producing vfas in both reactors decreased from 48 22 rm and 67 95 rb to 4 07 rm and 6 32 rb and bacteroidetes comprises species with a broad range of capabilities such as hydrolysis of polysaccharides and proteins fermentation of sugars and production of acids hahnke et al 2015 member of this group was reported to be able to transfer electrons to fe iii during its growth by adopting glucose as carbon source wang et al 2010 actinobacteria exhibits diverse physiological and metabolic properties such as the production of extracellular enzymes ventura et al 2007 while proteobacteria is an important consumer of glucose and long chain vfas ariesyady et al 2007 at the genus level fig 3 b some electricigens like geobacter desulfovibrio and some species belong to phylum chloroflexi were found to be enriched in rm zhao et al 2018 reported that fe3o4 could enhance the solubilization hydrolysis and acidification processes through the dissimilatory iron reduction process during the waste activated sludge digestion it is well known that some species of geobacter and desulfovibrio have the ability to perform dissimilatory metal reduction process moreover some geobacter species could participate in the diet process with methanosarcina species holmes et al 2017 and methanothrix species rotaru et al 2014 desulfovibrio species were also reported to have syntrophic associations with methanosarcina barkeri to realize the degradation of lactate mcinerney and bryant 1981 besides the abundances of syntrophic vfas degrading bacteria treponema smithella and syntrophobacter in rm were 3 81 fold 2 22 fold and 2 05 fold of those in rb at the end of operation it was supposed that treponema in rm in day 130 with abundance of 47 66 converted acetate to h2 co2 to avoid the accumulation of redundant acetate leven et al 2007 the enrichment of saccharibacteria unclassified 39 16 and brooklawina 12 01 in rb in day 130 could be the cause of vfas accumulation thereinto brooklawina was reported to produce propionate and acetate via glucose fermentation bae et al 2006 3 3 2 analysis of archaea community the alpha diversity indices of archaea community were less affected by the magnetite dissolution table s1 comparing with those of bacterial community the dominant methanogen at genus level of the six samples was methanothrix fig 3 c also known as methanosaeta hulshoff pol et al 2004 as is well known methanothrix specialized in consuming acetate is sensitive to high vfas concentration it was supposed that the increased olr caused increase of vfas concentration which limited the growth of methanothrix even so the abundances of methanothrix in rm 90 11 for day 0 80 62 for day 85 77 66 for day 130 were always higher than those in rb 83 22 for day 0 77 00 for day 85 71 31 for day 130 it was supposed that the addition of magnetite enriched methanothrix as diet partner in contrast methanoregula methanobacterium and methanosarcina which are more tenacious tolerance due to their smaller surface increased in both reactors during the operation hydrogen utilizing methanogens such as methanobacterium could play a great role in methane production in rb during the period of high olr 3 4 analysis of eps 3 4 1 the ps and pn contents in eps eps is a major high molecular weight secretion from microorganisms binding with cells to protect them against external stress and performs the possible function of extracellular electron transfer eet shi et al 2017 eps contents of sludge from rb and rm were showed in fig 4 a the ps and pn contents in eps of sludge from both reactors were fluctuant the ratio of pn ps of sludge in rb decreased from 3 33 0 23 to 0 81 0 02 when the olr increased to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 day 120 while that in rm stabilized at 2 35 0 66 the increased ps in rb under high olr condition was supposed to be related with incomplete degradation of sucrose it was reported that higher pn content in eps could improve the cellular hydrophobicity and microbial aggregation basuvaraj et al 2015 3 4 2 analysis of eps components the eps components were further detected by 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy and the parafac analysis method was used to extract the real spectra from the overlapped spectra there were six major components in the eem spectra including oxidized f420 riboflavin pyridoxine tryptophan tyrosine nadh and humic like fig s4 fig 4 b showed that the peak intensity of oxidized f420 in rm was always higher than that in rb except for day 10 with hrt of 8 h and the performance of rm was deteriorated f420 is mainly related to the metabolic activity of co2 dependent methanogenesis costa and leigh 2014 the higher peak intensity of oxidized f420 in sludge of rm indicated that the activity of co2 dependent methanogenesis in rm reactor was enhanced combining with the performances of two reactors it was found that the peak intensities of riboflavin and pyridoxine had a positive relationship with the performance of egsb reactor the higher intensity of riboflavin in rm could facilitate the eet process xiao et al 2017 and stimulate the syntrophic metabolism of vfas pyridoxine was reported to work as cofactor for catalyzing the phosphorolytic cleavage of glycogen and a wide variety of metabolic reactions of amino acids srivastava et al 2014 the higher peak intensity of pyridoxine in rm except for day 10 when the hrt was 8 h reflected that the metabolic reactions were enhanced by magnetite addition 3 4 3 the redox activity of eps cyclic voltammetry cv curves of eps from rb and rm in day 100 were analyzed in order to investigate the influence of magnetite addition on the redox activity of eps as shown in fig 4 c reductive peak current of eps from rm was 0 51 μa which was 40 higher than that of rb 0 36 μa since cv shows barely redox difference of the eps from rb and rm more sensitive differential pulse voltammetry dpv was used to analyze the electrochemical active substance of eps from rm as shown in fig 4 d there were two pairs of dpv peaks the pair with the peak potentials ep 420 mv anodic versus ag agcl unless otherwise stated and 386 mv cathodic were attributed to flavins xiao et al 2017 and the pair at ep 120 mv anodic and 98 mv cathodic were very similar to those of the flavin mtrc combination okamoto et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 these results suggested that eps containing electron transient media played an important role in the eet process of syntrophy and addition of magnetite could enhance the electrochemical activity of eps to trigger a faster eet rate and increase methanogenic efficiency yin et al 2018 3 5 characteristics of ags 3 5 1 morphology of ags for exploring the difference of microbial aggregation in the presence and absence of magnetite the morphologies of sludge samples from two reactors at different stages were observed via sem fig 5 a and fig 5 d were images of the inoculated sludge for rb and rm respectively wang et al 2019 lots of magnetite like was observed in the inoculated sludge for rm it should be noted that the cells just attached to the magnetite yet not in close contact fig 5 d which was similar with the situation of addition of gac liu et al 2012 and biochar chen et al 2014 comparing with the inoculated sludge for rm microbes in the inoculated sludge for rb fig 5 a contacted more closely interestingly it was found that microbial aggregates in rm became denser than those in rb after the magnetite was totally washed out fig 5 e and f tem was further performed to observe the contact of cells in granules from rb and rm fig s5 it was found that cells in granules from rm combined more tightly than those from rb 3 5 2 physicochemical characteristics of ags mlss ss in short and mlvss vss in short of rm and rb during the operation were detected fig s6 the decline of vss in rm from 43 15 0 04 g l 1 to 33 13 0 24 g l 1 was due to the reduced hrt caused biomass loss and after hrt recovered to 12 h vss in rm increased to 62 67 1 57 g l 1 in contrast vss in rb decreased when the olr higher than 15 kg cod m 3 d 1 and the biomass loss was probably caused by the accumulation of vfas during the 130 day operation the value of vss ss of rm increased from 0 78 to 0 92 and the dissolution of magnetite was supposed to be the primary cause at the end of operation the particle size distributions of ags from two reactors were analyzed as shown in fig 6 a b the particle size distribution of ags from rm was much more convergent than that from rb at the same time the hydrophobicity of granular sludge of rm was 0 15 0 008 which was 66 67 higher than that of rb 0 09 0 005 p 0 01 fig 6 c the higher hydrophobicity could reduce the free energy on the cell surface which thermodynamically contributed to the sludge aggregation intensity of ags was further detected and was described as the integrity coefficient ic fig 6 d showed that ic of sludge in rm was 0 85 0 01 higher than that in rb with 0 68 0 01 p 0 05 granules with higher intensity could resist the shearing force of upwelling water and bubbles while the granules with lower intensity might cause the biomass loss and the reactor performance deterioration 3 5 3 electron transfer characteristics of ags conductivities of sludge samples from both reactors in two stages were detected fig 7 a result showed that the sludge conductivities of rm in day 60 stage i and day 120 stage ii were 14 05 2 83 μs cm 1 and 9 04 1 40 μs cm 1 respectively higher than those of rb of 6 02 1 83 μs cm 1 and 5 02 1 42 μs cm 1 respectively p 0 001 the decreased conductivity of sludge in rm could be due to the dissolution of magnetite nevertheless the sludge conductivity of rm was always higher than that of rb it was supposed that the diet based syntrophy which contributes to higher sludge conductivity zhao et al 2016 might be enhanced in rm reactor heme c concentrations of sludge from both reactors were quantified at the end of operation results showed that heme c concentration of rm was 0 00135 nmol g 1 vss which was one quarter of that of rb with 0 0054 nmol g 1 vss p 0 01 fig 7 b since heme is a key component of c type cytochrome it was supposed that magnetite replaced the function of c type cytochrome for efficient eet and therefore reduced the energy cost for synthesis of c type cytochrome it was supported by the report that magnetite compensates for the lack of a pilin associated c type cytochrome in extracellular electron exchange of geobacter sulfurreducens liu et al 2015 besides wang et al 2018b reported that the expression of both pili and c type cytochromes was decreased with magnetite addition the electron transport system ets activity was an effective indicator for respiration of microorganisms yin et al 2018 int ets was used to evaluate the activity of sludge in rb and rm at the end of operation which was correlated with the intracellular ets as shown in fig 7 c the ets value of rm 181 66 9 83 μg mg 1 h 1 was 25 73 higher than that of rb 144 48 9 99 μg mg 1 h 1 suggesting the electron transport efficiency of respiration in rm was facilitated since magnetite in rm was totally washed out at the end of operation the improved ets activity of rm could be attributed to the higher abundance as well as tighter connection of functional microbes 4 discussion as we know addition of magnetite could accelerate methanogenesis via enhancing diet based syntrophy cruz viggi et al 2014 wang et al 2018b however magnetite was found to run off in most continuous bioreactors baek et al 2017 and the effect of magnetite behavior on the syntrophic aggregates was underreported up to now different with the report that magnetite in continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs treating dairy effluent was washed out in form of magnetite baek et al 2017 it was found that magnetite in continuous egsb reactor was washed out in form of ferrous and ferric ions fig 2 the slightly acidic niche could be the primary cause of magnetite dissolution because the effluent iron ions concentration of rm increased fig 2 a as soon as the effluent ph reduced fig 1 c acidification of anaerobic digestion is the most common problem in treating industrial wastewater therefore the magnetite dissolution could be inevitable in these systems since iron is an essential trace metal for microorganisms especially for the methanogens it is possible that the iron ions from magnetite dissolution improved the performance of rm however the performance like cod removal efficiency and biogas production of rm had not been improved when the iron concentration increased fig 1 suggesting the iron ions were not a limiting factor besides it was reported that biogas production in the anaerobic digester were not affected by fecl3 dosing rebosura et al 2018 in contrast it was demonstrated that iron dosing fecl3 of 10 mg fe l 1 to sewers can achieve multiple benefits including sulfide removal in sewers phosphorus removal during wastewater treatment and hydrogen sulfide h2s removal during biogas generation in an urban wastewater system rebosura et al 2018 the high iron ions concentration in the effluent of rm could be beneficial for the post treatment like removal of phosphorus and sulfide even though the magnetite in rm was totally washed out in the form of iron ions at the end of operation the performance of rm was still better than rb which is different with the result of carbon materials addition on syntrophic metabolism rates zhao et al 2015 the enrichment of diet partners such as geobacter desulfovibrio methanothrix and methanosarcina as well as the higher abundances of syntrophic vfas degrading bacteria like treponema smithella and syntrophobacter in rm fig 3 could be the primary cause besides the improved redox activity of eps fig 4 c higher sludge conductivity and activity of the electron transport chain fig 7 showed that the electron transport efficiency of diet based syntrophic metabolism in rm was facilitated which favors vfas degradation fig 1 and methane production fig s2 it was reported that the magnetite enhanced diet allows electrons to be transferred among syntrophic partners at rate higher than those attainable via iht cruz viggi et al 2014 however it was found that magnetite enhanced syntrophic aggregates were looser in the presence of magnetite fig 4 d than those without magnetite enhanced fig 4 a diet partners were supposed to take magnetite as electron accepter or electron donor fig 8 a instead of contacting with each other closely to transport electron which was similar with the results of addition of biochar chen et al 2014 and gac liu et al 2012 the loosely combined aggregates in the presence of magnetite could result in biomass loss and vfas accumulation when hrt reduced which explained the reason that effect of magnetite addition on the methanogenesis in batch experiment cruz viggi et al 2014 was better than that in continuous bioreactor ambuchi et al 2017 in contrast the enriched diet partners had to contact with each other tightly to keep the diet based syntrophy in the absence of magnetite fig 8 b which could be an important cause of the formation of dense and active ags after magnetite being washed out besides the enriched polyvalent metal cations elements like al and ca in rm table 2 could enhance the formation of dense ags the formation of dense and active ags could be the main reason that rm showed a better performance than rb after the magnetite washed out although the dissolution of magnetite could be beneficial for the post treatment and favored the formation of dense and active ags fast dissolution of magnetite which could result in biomass loss should be avoided the hydraulic shear force and ph are considered to be two key parameters for the operation of magnetite enhanced reactor detection of ph and iron ions concentration of effluent is recommended for ensuring the success operation of magnetite enhanced reactor the existence of magnetite not only accelerates the rate of syntrophic metabolism via enhancing the diet but also favors the growth and propagation of diet based syntrophic microbes therefore the regular resupply of magnetite is recommended in the future study and engineering application besides further investigations on the mechanism of magnetite enriching candidate diet partners could favor the high efficient anaerobic wastewater treatment and resource recovery 5 conclusion magnetite in continuous egsb reactor was found to be washed out in form of iron ions and the slightly acidic niche of the anaerobic bioreactor was supposed to be the primary cause the addition of magnetite enriched candidate diet partners such as geobacter desulfovibrio and methanothrix the sludge in rm showed higher conductivity and stronger eps redox ability which favored vfas degradation and methane production probably via enhancing the diet based syntrophic metabolism microorganisms including syntrophic partners were in loose combination under high olr condition in the presence of magnetite but with the gradual loss of magnetite dense and active ags was formed in rm the robust diet based syntrophy after magnetite adding could favor the high efficient anaerobic wastewater treatment and resource recovery in the future and further investigations on magnetite resupply and the mechanism of magnetite enriching candidate diet partners are recommended conflicts of

18543,increasing studies indicate that magnetite addition could accelerate the methanogenesis via enhancing direct interspecies electron transfer diet based anaerobic syntrophy however magnetite is found to run off in continuous bioreactor and the effect of magnetite loss on syntrophic aggregates is still underreported in this study two egsb reactors rm with magnetite enhanced sludge and rb as a control were operated to investigate the magnetite behavior in continuous bioreactor and the corresponding response of syntrophic aggregates results showed that magnetite in rm was washed out gradually in form of iron ions and a slightly acidic niche was supposed to be the major cause nevertheless candidate diet partners like geobacter and methanothrix along with syntrophic volatile fatty acids vfas degrading microbes were enriched in rm in addition the improved redox activity of extracellular polymeric substance eps higher sludge conductivity and electron transport activity suggested that the diet ability of sludge in rm was still enhanced which favors the syntrophic metabolism of vfas interestingly syntrophic partners were loosely combined under the condition of high organic loading rate olr in the presence of magnetite but with gradual loss of magnetite dense and active anaerobic granular sludge ags was formed in rm this study provided a comprehensive understanding of magnetite behavior in continuous bioreactor and the response of syntrophic aggregates the robust diet based syntrophy after magnetite adding could favor the high efficient anaerobic wastewater treatment and resource recovery in the future and further investigations on magnetite resupply and the mechanism of magnetite enriching candidate diet partners are recommended graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic bioreactor magnetite behavior anaerobic granular sludge ags syntrophic metabolism direct interspecies electron transfer diet 1 introduction anaerobic syntrophy is an essential intermediary step in the anaerobic conversion of organic matter into methane where syntrophic microorganisms are linked tightly by the need of maintaining the exchanged metabolites at low concentrations morris et al 2013 actually cooperative partners in natural environments often form multi species aggregates it was theoretically suggested that close physical contact between syntrophic microbes such as volatile fatty acids vfas fermenting syntrophic microbes and methanogens was important for efficient interspecies electron transfer iet ishii et al 2006 interspecies hydrogen transfer iht and interspecies formate transfer ift are well documented strategies for iet during the syntrophic metabolism sieber et al 2012 recently direct interspecies electron transfer diet was found to be an alternative to iht or ift during some syntrophic metabolism lovley 2017 diet could occur spontaneously between some anaerobic microbes via conductive pili summers et al 2010 or addition of various non biological conductive materials like magnetite and conductive carbon materials lovley 2017 morita et al 2011 reported that methanogenic aggregates were electrically conductive it seems that diet could be an important mechanism for electron exchange in syntrophic aggregates recently many studies have shown that addition of conductive materials could accelerate the rate of syntrophic metabolism of vfas via enhancing diet cruz viggi et al 2014 baek et al 2016 lovley 2017 however it is still unknown whether the enhanced diet could facilitate the formation of anaerobic granular sludge ags which is crucial to retain high biomass concentration and realize the stable operation of up flow bioreactor liu et al 2012 reported that addition of granular activated carbon gac could accelerate the metabolism of two diet partners geobacter metallireducens and geobacter sulfurreducens they observed that cells attached to gac but did not aggregate as they do when making biological electrical connections between cells besides chen et al 2014 addressed the impact of biochar on syntrophic associations based on diet and found that syntrophic cells attached to the biochar yet not in close contact both studies were based on batch experiments with addition of conductive carbon materials while the effect of conductive iron oxides addition on the formation of aggregates based on continuously operated up flow bioreactor is lack of research it should be noted that conductive iron oxides like magnetite could run off through effluent in continuous bioreactor and the response of syntrophic aggregates to magnetite loss is underreported in the present studies baek et al 2016 ambuchi et al 2017 particularly when treating industrial wastewater the performance of anaerobic reactor could be unstable due to the seasonal closure of industries or fluctuation of influent quality and quantity which could accelerate the dissolution and loss of magnetite it was reported that when the conductive carbon materials were removed rates of syntrophic metabolism of these reactors declined to rates comparable to the control reactor zhao et al 2015 whereas the effect of magnetite fade away on syntrophic metabolism during long term operation of reactor was unclear the exploration of magnetite behavior in anaerobic bioreactor and its effect on syntrophic aggregates could be vital for the application of magnetite enhanced anaerobic process this study encompassed a detailed investigation into the magnetite behavior and the corresponding response of syntrophic aggregates in egsb reactor the objectives of this study were 1 to explore the magnetite behavior in continuous anaerobic bioreactor 2 to reveal the functional microbial community succession in bioreactor with without magnetite and 3 to clarify the response of syntrophic aggregates to the magnetite behavior in terms of electron transfer characteristics and physicochemical characteristics of ags 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of reactors in this study two egsb reactors namely rb and rm were built and operated in parallel each egsb reactor was constructed by plexiglass with a height of 65 cm and a total volume of 7 5 l fig s1 the inoculated sludge was collected from two parallel operated lab scale uasb reactors with one reactor dosing with magnetite for rm and another as a control for rb wang et al 2019 the total iron in the inoculated sludge and water for rb and rm were 0 45 0 03 g and 10 26 0 11 g respectively the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of the inoculated sludge for rm were 53 20 0 54 g l 1 and 40 91 0 64 g l 1 respectively the mlss and mlvss of the inoculated sludge for rb were 44 67 0 01 g l 1 and 36 72 0 25 g l 1 respectively each reactor was inoculated with 160 g mlvss of seed sludge these two reactors were fed with synthetic wastewater using sucrose as carbon source as reported in wang et al 2019 both reactors were operated continuously in parallel for 130 days and the whole operation was divided into two stages stage i day 1 70 and stage ii day 71 130 the specific operation parameters were showed in table 1 both reactors were placed in a greenhouse with temperature controlled at 35 2 c 2 2 regular analytical methods the ph cod mlss mlvss and dissolved iron ions were determined according to standard methods walter 2005 and there were three technical replicates vfas concentration and biogas components were measured according to wang et al 2019 2 3 analysis of eps components extracellular polymeric substance eps of sludge was extracted using a heating method li and yang 2007 the polysaccharide ps and protein pn contents in the eps were quantified according to dubois et al 1956 and lowry et al 1951 respectively a three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectrometer f 4500 fl hitachi together with the parallel factor parafac analysis were used to obtain the variation of the eps components electrochemical measurements of eps were further performed using an autolab electrochemical workstation chi660e china the detailed methods of 3d eem spectra parafac analysis and electrochemical measurements of eps were provided in the supporting information 2 4 analysis of sludge characteristics the electron transport system ets activities of sludge samples were measured by the 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyltetrazolium chloride electron transport system int ets method yin et al 2018 the equation was slightly modified by changing the volume of mixed liquor to the weight of sludge 1 u d 485 v e kwt where u is the ets activity μg mg 1 h 1 d485 is the absorbance at 485 nm ve is the volume of extractant ml k is the slope of the standard curve w is the weight of sludge mg and t is the incubation time h the conductivities of sludge samples were determined by gold electrode conductivity measurement according to zhao et al 2016 and the sludge conductivity was calculated using the following equation 2 σ l r s where σ is the conductivity of sludge μs cm 1 l is the width of the gap cm r is the reciprocal of the slope in the current voltage curve ω and s is the cross sectional area cm2 the relative hydrophobicity rh of ags and the granular strength described as the integrity coefficient ic were measured according to wang et al 2018a heme c concentration was quantified according to berry and trumpower 1987 the mean size and size density distribution of the ags were measured by analyzers for particle size and shape qicpic sympatec germany the morphologies of the sludge samples were observed by scanning electron microscope sem hitachi su 8010 japan and transmission electron microscopy tem hitachi h 7650 japan the iron content of the sludge samples was analyzed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx x ray diffraction xrd polycrystal x ray diffractometer of rigaku dmax 2550pc japan was used to characterize the sludge samples with without magnetite addition 2 5 analysis of microbial community 16s rdna of sludge samples collected from rb and rm at day 0 day 85 and day 130 were extracted with mobio powersoil dna isolation kit

similarity of 97 has been considered to classify into the same operational taxonomic units otus alpha diversity indices including observed species chao1 simpson and shannon were calculated according to wang et al 2019 2 6 data analysis analysis of iron balance of rb and rm was performed and the detail was provided in the supporting information statistical analysis was conducted by the t test using spss spss 17 0 and significant differences were indicated as follows p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 3 results 3 1 performance of egsb reactors 3 1 1 cod removal efficiency as shown in fig 1 a the cod removal efficiency of rm dropped rapidly from 97 40 0 58 to 65 66 2 36 when hrt reduced from 12 h to 8 h and after hrt returned to 12 h that of rm recovered to 98 51 0 81 it was obviously that the performance of rm was sensitive to the hydraulic loading when keeping hrt at 12 h and increasing olr to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 the cod removal efficiency of rb dropped gradually while that of rm stabilized at 97 25 1 05 during the stage ii where hrt was kept at 12 h and olr of both reactors was increased from 4 kg cod m 3 d 1 to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 the cod removal efficiency of rm was higher than 95 while that of rb dropped gradually again and led to anaerobic digestion failure finally despite rm was sensitive to the hydraulic loading its olr tolerance was at least 33 33 higher than that of rb under the hrt of 12 h 3 1 2 biogas production result of biogas production was showed in fig 1 b the biogas production of rm dropped rapidly from 0 49 0 02 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 to 0 32 0 07 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 when the hrt reduced from 12 h to 8 h while that of rb stabilized at 0 46 0 02 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 however when the olr increased to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 stage i day 47 70 the biogas production of rb decreased gradually from 0 46 0 04 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 to 0 28 0 02 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 while that of rm stabilized at 0 45 0 05 m3 kg 1 cod d 1 during stage ii when the olr increased to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 the biogas production of rb declined again while that of rm was stable regueiro et al 2015 found that the active archaea decreased during organic overloading shock the declined biogas production of rb at olr of 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 could be attributed to the over load olr inhibited the metabolism of methanogens in contrast the stable biogas production of rm at olr of 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 suggested that the magnetite enhanced anaerobic system could reduce the inhibition of high load olr to methanogens the biogas composition during the normal operation of stage ii was analyzed fig s2 result showed that the methane proportion in rm was 58 14 4 40 slightly higher than that in rb 54 24 5 49 it was supposed that some methanogens were selectively enriched in rm which made a direct contribution to higher methane proportion in rm 3 1 3 variation of ph and vfas as shown in fig 1 c the influent ph was maintained at 8 30 0 19 while the effluent ph of two reactors was fluctuating specifically the effluent ph of rm decreased from 7 03 0 01 to 6 28 0 03 when the hrt reduced from 12 h to 8 h and after the hrt recovered to 12 h that of rm increased to 7 00 0 19 which favors the growth of methanogens although the effluent ph of rb was less affected by the hrt it was sensitive to the olr when the olr increased to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 stage i the effluent ph of rb decreased gradually to 6 06 0 04 during the stage ii the effluent ph of rb stabilized at 6 95 0 15 for day 71 115 and then dropped again when the olr reached 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 vfas as a key factor influencing the performance of anaerobic reactor was further detected during day 120 130 as shown in fig 1 d the accumulation of propionate and acetate in rb was the main cause of decreased ph particularly the propionate the conversion of propionate is thermodynamically unfavorable under the standard condition ch3ch2coo 2h2o ch3coo 3h2 co2 δg 76 1 kj mol 1 and when the aceticlastic methanogenesis was inhibited the reaction of acetate metabolized by bacteria into hydrogen is also thermodynamically unfavorable under the standard condition ch3coo 4h2o 4h2 2hco3 h δg 104 6 kj mol 1 however these reactions could be achieved via syntrophic interaction which keeps a low level hydrogen partial pressure demirel and scherer 2008 the accumulation of propionate and acetate suggested that the corresponding syntrophic microbes in rb might be deficient or inhibited in contrast the vfas concentration in rm stabilized at 225 56 50 06 mg l 1 as we know methanogens grow relatively slower and are less robust than acidogens the result of less vfas accumulation in rm indicated that the syntrophic metabolism rate of vfas could be enhanced by magnetite probably via building and enhancing the diet based syntrophy yin et al 2018 3 2 behavior of magnetite during the operation the concentrations of effluent ferrous and ferric ions of rb and rm were detected as shown in fig 2 a the concentrations of effluent ferrous and ferric ions of rb were negligible while those of rm were fluctuating obviously the highest iron ion concentration including ferrous and ferric ions in effluent of rm reached 32 49 0 30 mg l 1 the analysis of iron balance in both egsb reactors was performed fig s3 the input iron includes iron in the inoculated sludge and water and iron in the influent the total iron in the inoculated sludge and water of rb and rm were 0 45 0 03 g and 10 26 0 11 g respectively the influent brought in 0 395 0 001 g of iron ion for each reactor the output iron includes washed out iron via the effluent and residual iron in the reactor thereinto the accumulation of washed out iron via the effluent for rb and rm were 0 59 0 02 g and 9 37 0 22 g which accounted for 63 37 and 94 51 of total iron in rb and rm respectively xrd analysis was performed on the sludge collected from rb and rm at day 5 and day 130 as shown in fig 2 b sludge collected from rb contained silicon dioxide while sludge collected from rm contained silicon dioxide and magnetite in day 5 however the xrd peak patterns of rb and rm were similar in day 130 and no magnetite was found in sludge from rm at the same time the iron contents of the sludge from two reactors were measured by edx as shown in table 2 the iron contents of sludge in rb and rm were 0 01 wt and 0 32 wt respectively actually the iron content of inoculated sludge for rm was 23 15 wt these results together with the result of high iron ions concentration in effluent of rm indicated that the magnetite in rm was washed out in form of iron ions during the 130 day operation interestingly the elements of polyvalent metal cations such as al and ca were slightly enriched in rm while the na content was slightly higher in rb suanon et al 2016 also reported that addition of magnetite could regulate and control the mobilization of metals like cd co cu zn ni and cr during anaerobic digestion process the enrichment of polyvalent metal cations which favors the formation of ags could be relative to the addition of magnetite 3 3 analysis of microbial communities microbial communities were investigated by illumina masiq high throughput sequencing the objective was to assess the potential influence of magnetite and its dissolution on microbial community composition and identify key microorganisms involved in structural modifications of the microbiota 3 3 1 analysis of bacterial community for the bacterial community the alpha diversity indices were showed in table 3 higher alpha diversity indices in rm indicated that the magnetite addition could increase the bacterial abundance and diversity bacterial taxonomy results showed that the dominant phyla of the six sludge samples were candidatus saccharibacteria firmicutes actinobacteria bacteroidetes spirochaetes and proteobacteria fig 3 a candidatus saccharibacteria plays an important role in the degradation of various organics like sugar compounds under anaerobic condition kindaichi et al 2016 it was found that candidatus saccharibacteria in rb increased from 1 16 to 39 16 during the operation while that in rm increased from 7 23 to 42 67 and then decreased to 7 2 interestingly the abundance of spirochaetes in rm in day 130 reached 50 80 3 87 fold as that in rb 13 11 spirochaetes has been reported to have metabolic activities including acetate ethanol and lactate fermentations from glucose as well as the acetate oxidation lee et al 2015 the enrichment of spirochaetes in rm could play a crucial role in accelerating the degradation of vfas during the high olr operation the abundance of firmicutes a syntrophic bacteria degrading various substrates and producing vfas in both reactors decreased from 48 22 rm and 67 95 rb to 4 07 rm and 6 32 rb and bacteroidetes comprises species with a broad range of capabilities such as hydrolysis of polysaccharides and proteins fermentation of sugars and production of acids hahnke et al 2015 member of this group was reported to be able to transfer electrons to fe iii during its growth by adopting glucose as carbon source wang et al 2010 actinobacteria exhibits diverse physiological and metabolic properties such as the production of extracellular enzymes ventura et al 2007 while proteobacteria is an important consumer of glucose and long chain vfas ariesyady et al 2007 at the genus level fig 3 b some electricigens like geobacter desulfovibrio and some species belong to phylum chloroflexi were found to be enriched in rm zhao et al 2018 reported that fe3o4 could enhance the solubilization hydrolysis and acidification processes through the dissimilatory iron reduction process during the waste activated sludge digestion it is well known that some species of geobacter and desulfovibrio have the ability to perform dissimilatory metal reduction process moreover some geobacter species could participate in the diet process with methanosarcina species holmes et al 2017 and methanothrix species rotaru et al 2014 desulfovibrio species were also reported to have syntrophic associations with methanosarcina barkeri to realize the degradation of lactate mcinerney and bryant 1981 besides the abundances of syntrophic vfas degrading bacteria treponema smithella and syntrophobacter in rm were 3 81 fold 2 22 fold and 2 05 fold of those in rb at the end of operation it was supposed that treponema in rm in day 130 with abundance of 47 66 converted acetate to h2 co2 to avoid the accumulation of redundant acetate leven et al 2007 the enrichment of saccharibacteria unclassified 39 16 and brooklawina 12 01 in rb in day 130 could be the cause of vfas accumulation thereinto brooklawina was reported to produce propionate and acetate via glucose fermentation bae et al 2006 3 3 2 analysis of archaea community the alpha diversity indices of archaea community were less affected by the magnetite dissolution table s1 comparing with those of bacterial community the dominant methanogen at genus level of the six samples was methanothrix fig 3 c also known as methanosaeta hulshoff pol et al 2004 as is well known methanothrix specialized in consuming acetate is sensitive to high vfas concentration it was supposed that the increased olr caused increase of vfas concentration which limited the growth of methanothrix even so the abundances of methanothrix in rm 90 11 for day 0 80 62 for day 85 77 66 for day 130 were always higher than those in rb 83 22 for day 0 77 00 for day 85 71 31 for day 130 it was supposed that the addition of magnetite enriched methanothrix as diet partner in contrast methanoregula methanobacterium and methanosarcina which are more tenacious tolerance due to their smaller surface increased in both reactors during the operation hydrogen utilizing methanogens such as methanobacterium could play a great role in methane production in rb during the period of high olr 3 4 analysis of eps 3 4 1 the ps and pn contents in eps eps is a major high molecular weight secretion from microorganisms binding with cells to protect them against external stress and performs the possible function of extracellular electron transfer eet shi et al 2017 eps contents of sludge from rb and rm were showed in fig 4 a the ps and pn contents in eps of sludge from both reactors were fluctuant the ratio of pn ps of sludge in rb decreased from 3 33 0 23 to 0 81 0 02 when the olr increased to 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 day 120 while that in rm stabilized at 2 35 0 66 the increased ps in rb under high olr condition was supposed to be related with incomplete degradation of sucrose it was reported that higher pn content in eps could improve the cellular hydrophobicity and microbial aggregation basuvaraj et al 2015 3 4 2 analysis of eps components the eps components were further detected by 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy and the parafac analysis method was used to extract the real spectra from the overlapped spectra there were six major components in the eem spectra including oxidized f420 riboflavin pyridoxine tryptophan tyrosine nadh and humic like fig s4 fig 4 b showed that the peak intensity of oxidized f420 in rm was always higher than that in rb except for day 10 with hrt of 8 h and the performance of rm was deteriorated f420 is mainly related to the metabolic activity of co2 dependent methanogenesis costa and leigh 2014 the higher peak intensity of oxidized f420 in sludge of rm indicated that the activity of co2 dependent methanogenesis in rm reactor was enhanced combining with the performances of two reactors it was found that the peak intensities of riboflavin and pyridoxine had a positive relationship with the performance of egsb reactor the higher intensity of riboflavin in rm could facilitate the eet process xiao et al 2017 and stimulate the syntrophic metabolism of vfas pyridoxine was reported to work as cofactor for catalyzing the phosphorolytic cleavage of glycogen and a wide variety of metabolic reactions of amino acids srivastava et al 2014 the higher peak intensity of pyridoxine in rm except for day 10 when the hrt was 8 h reflected that the metabolic reactions were enhanced by magnetite addition 3 4 3 the redox activity of eps cyclic voltammetry cv curves of eps from rb and rm in day 100 were analyzed in order to investigate the influence of magnetite addition on the redox activity of eps as shown in fig 4 c reductive peak current of eps from rm was 0 51 μa which was 40 higher than that of rb 0 36 μa since cv shows barely redox difference of the eps from rb and rm more sensitive differential pulse voltammetry dpv was used to analyze the electrochemical active substance of eps from rm as shown in fig 4 d there were two pairs of dpv peaks the pair with the peak potentials ep 420 mv anodic versus ag agcl unless otherwise stated and 386 mv cathodic were attributed to flavins xiao et al 2017 and the pair at ep 120 mv anodic and 98 mv cathodic were very similar to those of the flavin mtrc combination okamoto et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 these results suggested that eps containing electron transient media played an important role in the eet process of syntrophy and addition of magnetite could enhance the electrochemical activity of eps to trigger a faster eet rate and increase methanogenic efficiency yin et al 2018 3 5 characteristics of ags 3 5 1 morphology of ags for exploring the difference of microbial aggregation in the presence and absence of magnetite the morphologies of sludge samples from two reactors at different stages were observed via sem fig 5 a and fig 5 d were images of the inoculated sludge for rb and rm respectively wang et al 2019 lots of magnetite like was observed in the inoculated sludge for rm it should be noted that the cells just attached to the magnetite yet not in close contact fig 5 d which was similar with the situation of addition of gac liu et al 2012 and biochar chen et al 2014 comparing with the inoculated sludge for rm microbes in the inoculated sludge for rb fig 5 a contacted more closely interestingly it was found that microbial aggregates in rm became denser than those in rb after the magnetite was totally washed out fig 5 e and f tem was further performed to observe the contact of cells in granules from rb and rm fig s5 it was found that cells in granules from rm combined more tightly than those from rb 3 5 2 physicochemical characteristics of ags mlss ss in short and mlvss vss in short of rm and rb during the operation were detected fig s6 the decline of vss in rm from 43 15 0 04 g l 1 to 33 13 0 24 g l 1 was due to the reduced hrt caused biomass loss and after hrt recovered to 12 h vss in rm increased to 62 67 1 57 g l 1 in contrast vss in rb decreased when the olr higher than 15 kg cod m 3 d 1 and the biomass loss was probably caused by the accumulation of vfas during the 130 day operation the value of vss ss of rm increased from 0 78 to 0 92 and the dissolution of magnetite was supposed to be the primary cause at the end of operation the particle size distributions of ags from two reactors were analyzed as shown in fig 6 a b the particle size distribution of ags from rm was much more convergent than that from rb at the same time the hydrophobicity of granular sludge of rm was 0 15 0 008 which was 66 67 higher than that of rb 0 09 0 005 p 0 01 fig 6 c the higher hydrophobicity could reduce the free energy on the cell surface which thermodynamically contributed to the sludge aggregation intensity of ags was further detected and was described as the integrity coefficient ic fig 6 d showed that ic of sludge in rm was 0 85 0 01 higher than that in rb with 0 68 0 01 p 0 05 granules with higher intensity could resist the shearing force of upwelling water and bubbles while the granules with lower intensity might cause the biomass loss and the reactor performance deterioration 3 5 3 electron transfer characteristics of ags conductivities of sludge samples from both reactors in two stages were detected fig 7 a result showed that the sludge conductivities of rm in day 60 stage i and day 120 stage ii were 14 05 2 83 μs cm 1 and 9 04 1 40 μs cm 1 respectively higher than those of rb of 6 02 1 83 μs cm 1 and 5 02 1 42 μs cm 1 respectively p 0 001 the decreased conductivity of sludge in rm could be due to the dissolution of magnetite nevertheless the sludge conductivity of rm was always higher than that of rb it was supposed that the diet based syntrophy which contributes to higher sludge conductivity zhao et al 2016 might be enhanced in rm reactor heme c concentrations of sludge from both reactors were quantified at the end of operation results showed that heme c concentration of rm was 0 00135 nmol g 1 vss which was one quarter of that of rb with 0 0054 nmol g 1 vss p 0 01 fig 7 b since heme is a key component of c type cytochrome it was supposed that magnetite replaced the function of c type cytochrome for efficient eet and therefore reduced the energy cost for synthesis of c type cytochrome it was supported by the report that magnetite compensates for the lack of a pilin associated c type cytochrome in extracellular electron exchange of geobacter sulfurreducens liu et al 2015 besides wang et al 2018b reported that the expression of both pili and c type cytochromes was decreased with magnetite addition the electron transport system ets activity was an effective indicator for respiration of microorganisms yin et al 2018 int ets was used to evaluate the activity of sludge in rb and rm at the end of operation which was correlated with the intracellular ets as shown in fig 7 c the ets value of rm 181 66 9 83 μg mg 1 h 1 was 25 73 higher than that of rb 144 48 9 99 μg mg 1 h 1 suggesting the electron transport efficiency of respiration in rm was facilitated since magnetite in rm was totally washed out at the end of operation the improved ets activity of rm could be attributed to the higher abundance as well as tighter connection of functional microbes 4 discussion as we know addition of magnetite could accelerate methanogenesis via enhancing diet based syntrophy cruz viggi et al 2014 wang et al 2018b however magnetite was found to run off in most continuous bioreactors baek et al 2017 and the effect of magnetite behavior on the syntrophic aggregates was underreported up to now different with the report that magnetite in continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs treating dairy effluent was washed out in form of magnetite baek et al 2017 it was found that magnetite in continuous egsb reactor was washed out in form of ferrous and ferric ions fig 2 the slightly acidic niche could be the primary cause of magnetite dissolution because the effluent iron ions concentration of rm increased fig 2 a as soon as the effluent ph reduced fig 1 c acidification of anaerobic digestion is the most common problem in treating industrial wastewater therefore the magnetite dissolution could be inevitable in these systems since iron is an essential trace metal for microorganisms especially for the methanogens it is possible that the iron ions from magnetite dissolution improved the performance of rm however the performance like cod removal efficiency and biogas production of rm had not been improved when the iron concentration increased fig 1 suggesting the iron ions were not a limiting factor besides it was reported that biogas production in the anaerobic digester were not affected by fecl3 dosing rebosura et al 2018 in contrast it was demonstrated that iron dosing fecl3 of 10 mg fe l 1 to sewers can achieve multiple benefits including sulfide removal in sewers phosphorus removal during wastewater treatment and hydrogen sulfide h2s removal during biogas generation in an urban wastewater system rebosura et al 2018 the high iron ions concentration in the effluent of rm could be beneficial for the post treatment like removal of phosphorus and sulfide even though the magnetite in rm was totally washed out in the form of iron ions at the end of operation the performance of rm was still better than rb which is different with the result of carbon materials addition on syntrophic metabolism rates zhao et al 2015 the enrichment of diet partners such as geobacter desulfovibrio methanothrix and methanosarcina as well as the higher abundances of syntrophic vfas degrading bacteria like treponema smithella and syntrophobacter in rm fig 3 could be the primary cause besides the improved redox activity of eps fig 4 c higher sludge conductivity and activity of the electron transport chain fig 7 showed that the electron transport efficiency of diet based syntrophic metabolism in rm was facilitated which favors vfas degradation fig 1 and methane production fig s2 it was reported that the magnetite enhanced diet allows electrons to be transferred among syntrophic partners at rate higher than those attainable via iht cruz viggi et al 2014 however it was found that magnetite enhanced syntrophic aggregates were looser in the presence of magnetite fig 4 d than those without magnetite enhanced fig 4 a diet partners were supposed to take magnetite as electron accepter or electron donor fig 8 a instead of contacting with each other closely to transport electron which was similar with the results of addition of biochar chen et al 2014 and gac liu et al 2012 the loosely combined aggregates in the presence of magnetite could result in biomass loss and vfas accumulation when hrt reduced which explained the reason that effect of magnetite addition on the methanogenesis in batch experiment cruz viggi et al 2014 was better than that in continuous bioreactor ambuchi et al 2017 in contrast the enriched diet partners had to contact with each other tightly to keep the diet based syntrophy in the absence of magnetite fig 8 b which could be an important cause of the formation of dense and active ags after magnetite being washed out besides the enriched polyvalent metal cations elements like al and ca in rm table 2 could enhance the formation of dense ags the formation of dense and active ags could be the main reason that rm showed a better performance than rb after the magnetite washed out although the dissolution of magnetite could be beneficial for the post treatment and favored the formation of dense and active ags fast dissolution of magnetite which could result in biomass loss should be avoided the hydraulic shear force and ph are considered to be two key parameters for the operation of magnetite enhanced reactor detection of ph and iron ions concentration of effluent is recommended for ensuring the success operation of magnetite enhanced reactor the existence of magnetite not only accelerates the rate of syntrophic metabolism via enhancing the diet but also favors the growth and propagation of diet based syntrophic microbes therefore the regular resupply of magnetite is recommended in the future study and engineering application besides further investigations on the mechanism of magnetite enriching candidate diet partners could favor the high efficient anaerobic wastewater treatment and resource recovery 5 conclusion magnetite in continuous egsb reactor was found to be washed out in form of iron ions and the slightly acidic niche of the anaerobic bioreactor was supposed to be the primary cause the addition of magnetite enriched candidate diet partners such as geobacter desulfovibrio and methanothrix the sludge in rm showed higher conductivity and stronger eps redox ability which favored vfas degradation and methane production probably via enhancing the diet based syntrophic metabolism microorganisms including syntrophic partners were in loose combination under high olr condition in the presence of magnetite but with the gradual loss of magnetite dense and active ags was formed in rm the robust diet based syntrophy after magnetite adding could favor the high efficient anaerobic wastewater treatment and resource recovery in the future and further investigations on magnetite resupply and the mechanism of magnetite enriching candidate diet partners are recommended conflicts of

18544,this study employed a titanium mesh membrane assembly mma as the current collector in flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi device designated as m fcdi and obtained a much reduced charge transport distance as compared to traditional fcdi with plate shaped current collectors located far from the exchange membrane the average salt removal rate of m fcdi was greatly improved by 76 under 10 wt carbon content than the control experiment with graphite plate as current collector and the charge efficiency remained over 75 even under low carbon loading this improvement was attributed to the reduced resistance as revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests further investigation on fcdi s performance with different specifications of titanium meshes showed that the implementation of mma could provide a larger effective electron transfer area which would lead to better desalting performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization flow electrode mesh membrane assembly charge transport desalination 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging technology as it greatly facilitates energy efficient cost effective and eco friendly desalination process and has been applied in brackish water desalination and removing pollutants from waste streams and contaminated water to alleviate global water stress anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 in a cdi process ions migrate from saline water to electrode and store in electric double layers with an external electric field as the driving force generally the electrode of cdi is porous materials such as activated carbon carbon aerogels activated carbon cloth and ordered mesoporous carbon in particular flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi has attracted increasing attention in recent years for its continuous desalination ability and high adsorption capacity jeon et al 2013 porada et al 2014 different from the static electrodes in conventional cdi and membrane capacitive deionization mcdi an fcdi system utilizes the suspension of flow electrodes composed of porous activated carbon and electrolyte that normally flows in the channel carved on the current collectors during the desalination the electrode adsorbs ions while flowing in the channel simultaneously the electrodes are regenerated by mixing of positive and negative slurries outside the device without an extra discharging period it was demonstrated in a number of studies that the properties and carbon content of the electrode the concentration of electrolyte and operation mode all affect the desalination performance of fcdi park et al 2016 porada et al 2014 yang et al 2016 among which the slurry electrode is of great importance in fcdi the slurry electrode is responsible for conducting both the ions and the electrons specifically the ions transport through the liquid mediator and double layers at particle interface and the electrons through the mobile conduct net of the solid phase dennison et al 2014b kastening 1988 the carbon content of slurry electrode in previous researches mostly lies within a range of 5 wt to 20 wt given the fact that more carbon content would promote ion removal by facilitating electronic charge transfer bian et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 but bring extra difficulties for electrodes flow choo et al 2017 many studies so far have focused on the optimization of slurry electrode characteristics additional substances such as aqueous hydroquinone and benzoquinone ma et al 2016 carbon black liang et al 2017 and micro sized plate shaped graphite yang et al 2017 were employed in the flow electrodes to increase the conductivity some other studies achieved increased carbon loading in the flow electrodes by optimizing the rheological properties of the slurry electrode up to 28 wt of carbon content was introduced by using chemical oxidation of granular activated carbon hatzell et al 2015 even larger carbon loading of 35 wt was employed with functional groups in activated carbon and increased the salt removal efficiency from 8 to 28 park et al 2016 doornbusch and coworkers effectuated 35 wt of carbon loading of a flowable electrode by innovativing upflow fuidized bed mode doornbusch et al 2016 besides improvement on flow electrodes it is noticeable that the electronic charge transport in the cell is strongly associated with percolation among electrode particles and contact between activated carbon and current collector similar studies on electrochemical flow capacitors efcs that also employed carbon slurry electrodes reported a stratified charging regime along the direction from current collectors to ion exchange membranes iems in the slurry electrode for the incoherence of carbon particles dennison et al 2014b dennison et al indicated that the capacitance and conductivity of efcs slurry electrodes were closely related to cell dimensions and flow rate dennison et al 2014a hoyt et al 2016 specifically lager channel depth increased ohmic loss for longer charge transport distance in conventional fcdi the depth of plate channel is 1 2 mm which is too thick to offer an efficient charge transfer distance but this depth can hardly be decreased directly as it would restrain the electrodes flow and require increased pumping energy in order to optimize the pathway of charge transfer in the slurry electrode and to promote desalination performance this study proposed mesh membrane assembly mma in fcdi which employed the titanium mesh placed tight to the ion exchange membrane as the current collector rather than conventional graphite stainless plate charge transport distance was reduced significantly and thereby greatly increased salt removal rate desalting tests under different electrode concentrations and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements suggested that this improvement would be attributed to the much decreased system resistance and better utilization of carbon electrodes long term continuous operations for 24 h were carried out to evaluate the stability of desalting performance 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental setup three fcdi devices with different current collectors in materials and locations were integrated in this study as illustrated in fig 1 for m fcdi the braided titanium mesh was inserted between ion exchange membrane and perspex sheet while for t fcdi and g fcdi titanium mesh and graphite plate were placed on the other side of perspex sheet far from the membrane respectively the space chamber that allowed saline water to flow through was made of a silicone gasket and a 0 9 mm thick nylon grid between a pair of ion exchange membranes iems 0 28 mm in thickness including a cation exchange membrane cem and an anion exchange membrane aem df 120 tianwei membrane technology co ltd shandong china hollow serpentine channels 2 mm in width and 2 mm in depth were carved in perspex sheet for flow electrodes and the total area of the channels was 11 92 cm2 the titanium meshes were cut and washed ultrasonically in alcohol and distilled water each for 30 min to remove the surface impurities the wire diameters of three different specifications of titanium mesh tm 60 tm 80 tm 100 were around 100 μm and pore diameters were different as listed in table s2 the flow electrodes were composed of activated carbon ac yec 200d hongjie beijing with an average particle diameter of 20 μm and 0 65 g l 1 naso4 solution 1000 μs cm 1 which were stirred overnight to ensure homogeneous dispersion 2 2 desalting tests and electrochemical characterization in desalting experiments under batch mode 60 g slurry electrodes were recirculated in short circuit closed mode by a peristaltic pump longer pump baoding china at a constant flow rate of 15 ml min 1 and 60 ml of 0 65 g l 1 naso4 solution were cycled at the same flow rate while in continuous desalting the only different is that the salty solution was pumped in single pass mode with the flow rate of 1 ml min 1 a constant voltage of 1 2 v was applied to the fcdi using a potentiostat system arbin 161285 t arbin instruments inc usa for all desalting tests the electrical conductivity of saline water was monitored every 5 s by an online conductivity meter s700 seven excellence mettler toledo switzerland the salt concentration was

tests were performed with a sine wave signal at open circuit voltage with 5 mv amplitude and a scan frequency from 10 khz to 0 01 hz by an electrochemical workstation autolab pgstat204 metrohm switzerland the electrodes and saline water were cycled during the impedance tests the conductivity of saline water was monitored simultaneously the eis tests were performed after the electrodes and saline water were cycled for 15 min to ensure the uniform flow of electrodes and salt equilibrate on both sides of iem 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the fcdi devices due to the ion permeability of titanium mesh it provides the feasibility to adjust the form of the current collector to compare the performance of three devices 30 min desalting tests were operated in batch mode for two control groups i e t fcdi with tm 80 and g fcdi the desalination performance was similar fig 2 however when the titanium mesh was moved to near membrane side the asrr of m fcdi increased by about 76 with a greater steady current compared with g fcdi fig 2 comparing m fcdi with g fcdi the material and relative position of current collector were totally different nonetheless given the facts obtained from control groups that the effect of different electrical resistivity and surface properties between titanium and graphite on desalination can be neglected here we consider that the enhancement of performance was mainly owing to the decrease in charge and ion transfer distance when altering the position of current collector in fcdi to fully charge the carbon particles a short distance for charge transport in slurry electrodes is essential as shown in fig 3 a in the anode chamber of g fcdi the anions migrated into electrode chamber through aem and were absorbed by ac particles with an applied voltage then the electrons transported with the conductive network among ac particles moved through the 2 mm wide channel and finally reached the current collector however this process was significantly simplified when the titanium mesh was placed tight to the membrane in m fcdi fig 3b as both activated carbon and the ions could pass through the mesh the charge transport distance between activated carbon and current collector was considerably declined and the whole process could be accomplished in a narrow area which was about 0 2 mm in width in addition the position change of current collector led to an increased voltage difference across the iems and facilitated the ions adsorption in m fcdi dykstra et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2018 previous study on efcs found that the particles close to the current collectors would be saturated with charge initially and the majority of the charging took place within 750 μm region near the current collector in a 1 mm thick flow channel dennison et al 2014b thus compared to the ac particles adjacent to the iem in g fcdi those in m fcdi were charged more fully and resulted in quicker adsorption of the ions 3 2 electrochemical analysis nyquist plots in fig 4 a revealed the resistant difference between m fcdi and g fcdi similar to previous studies choo et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the nyquist plots consisted primarily a short curve an arc and a sloping line but the sloping line that represented the resistance for ion s limited migration in solutions park et al 2016 qu et al 2015 did not appear in g fcdi cell due to the lack of low scan frequency it is generally believed that the intersection value with the real impedance axis in the high frequency stands for the ohmic resistance which includes the resistance of the slurry saline water in the middle chamber membranes current collectors and all wires the small curve is regarded as interfacial contact resistance between the slurry electrode and the current collector the impedance of the porous electrode could be simulated from the arc in the nyquist plots by applying transmission line model as explored in mcdi petek et al 2015 qu et al 2015 but should note that the resistance of charge percolation cannot be ignored in fcdi system because of the discontinuity of carbon particles the conductivity of saline water in m fcdi and g fcdi remained stable during the impedance tests fig s1b indicating no obvious resistance change in saline water the fitting results showed that both ohmic resistance and contact resistance of the m fcdi was much reduced than g fcdi table s1 moreover the reduction of the arc diameter indicated the substantial attenuation of charge transfer and ion transfer resistance inside the electrodes the significant reductions of the resistances of ion and electron transport as observed in eis was also consistent with the shorten transport distance besides the decline of ohmic resistance was mainly credited to the reduction of the thickness of measured slurry these findings were in agreement with the study by choo et al who demonstrated the larger total resistance with thicker slurry electrodes for longer diffusion paths choo et al 2017 what is more the time constants in bode plots validated the promotion of removal rate fig 4b the two time constants in high frequency and low frequency were related to two interfacial reactions i e charge transfer at the surface of current collector and electrons release when the ions were adsorbed by the activated carbon respectively comparing with g fcdi the higher frequencies corresponding to the two peaks in the phase angel of m fcdi represented the smaller time constants which indicated the larger interfacial reaction rates pandey et al 2017 su et al 2017 3 3 effects of different carbon contents batch mode desalination tests under different carbon contents in m fcdi and t fcdi were conducted to further examine the effects of transfer distance on desalinating performance an increased carbon content improved asrr in both tested fcdi devices notably the advantages in the asrr of m fcdi over t fcdi were more significant when the carbon content was at a low level fig 5 specifically the asrr for m fcdi was 3 36 times of t fcdi when carbon content was 1 wt and was 1 87 times of t fcdi when carbon content was 10 wt this could be explained by the connected particle network as hatzell hatzell et al 2017 reported that part of electrically connected clusters would remarkably increase until ac loading increased to 10 wt which facilitated the charge transfer in particle particle interactions hence the performance under low carbon concentration would be in a greater dependence with the charge transfer distance because of more fully charged carbon particles near the membrane less potential was lost and charge efficiency and enrs in m fcdi remained over 75 and 6 48 μmol j 1 respectively in any tested carbon loading besides the higher charge efficiency of m fcdi was attributed to another notable change in current distribution when comparing with traditional fcdi device as shown in fig 3 specifically in both devices before the ions transported from the middle chamber to slurry electrode chamber the electricity produced from ion transport i ion equaled to external current i o and the electricity produced by electron transport i e was 0 as the desalting processes in traditional fcdi the charge transport occurred in the whole s shaped channel fig 3a however the charges including the ions and electrons in m fcdi transported in a small region near the mesh membrane about 0 2 mm in width while there were no current in the s shaped channel fig 3b which implied that the irreversible energy dissipate in charge transport would be considerably reduced the insignificant increase of charge efficiency at 10 wt carbon content was result from the high conductivity of electrode additionally m fcdi delivered remarkable desalination performance even with a lower carbon content for instance asrr of m fcdi at 5 wt carbon content was still higher than that of t fcdi at 10 wt carbon content because the carbon was better and fully utilized in m fcdi 3 4 optimization by adjusting aperture ratio of mesh three different specifications of titanium mesh including tm 60 tm 80 and tm 100 similar in thickness but different in apertures were investigated to further study the relationship between desalination performance and interface characteristics as the smallest hole tm 100 led to the biggest area of titanium wire note that the hole here referred to the ion transfer region while the wire to the electron transport with a stable charge efficiency over 80 asrr gradually increased with the wire area fig 6 which was owing to the increased effective electron transport area between ac and current collectors this indicated that electron transport was a dominating factor on m fcdi s desalination performance over ion transport under the precondition of ion and particle penetration it can be suggested that the development of a novel denser conductive weaving material is beneficial to desalination 3 5 continuous operation performance fig 7 a depicted the outflow concentration with the time under the single pass mode in m fcdi and t fcdi the effluent concentrations of two fcdi devices dropped sharply in the first hour and then remained stable the salt concentrations of effluent from m fcdi was lower than that of t fcdi during the stable period the asrr of m fcdi and t fcdi were around 0 54 and 0 42 μmol cm 2 s 1 respectively the average charge efficiency of m fcdi calculated every 30 min was higher than that of t fcdi fig 7b with enrs of 8 21 and 7 19 μmol j 1 respectively which was coincided with the current distribution discussed above in 3 3 and fig 3 the shorter ion transport distance between the membrane and charged ac decreased the energy consumption of m fcdi device besides we did not observe any cake formation on the membrane surface after 24 h operation in two cells which confirmed the fluidity and refreshment of slurry electrodes between the mesh and membrane the salt accumulated in slurry electrodes with the time gradually which led to reverse diffusion of the ions and the variation of electrode conductivity doornbusch et al 2016 yang et al 2016 it was noticed that the all the effluent concentration rose slowly in the later period as a consequence of the ion diffusion from the electrode to feed water with increasing concentration gradient which also caused the significant drop of charge efficiency fig 7b after 24 h desalination the conductivities of the electrolyte in m fcdi and t fcdi were around 15464 μs cm 1 and 12755 μs cm 1 approximately 11 4 and 9 4 times of the initial conductivity 1353 16 μs cm 1 respectively it was also noticeable that all the current increased during long term operation because of the increase of ion concentration in the electrode with higher current desalination performance was facilitated and diffusion effect was balanced this is why the effluent concentration of m fcdi remained lower than t fcdi although greater concentration gradient is observed in m fcdi 4 conclusions different from intensive researches on the flow electrodes of fcdi that aimed to improve the conductivity the mma for current collector prepared in this study facilitates the ion and electron transport by greatly reducing the transport distance within a narrow area as a consequence the salt removal rate is significantly improved and charge efficiency remains over 75 even with low carbon loading electrochemical tests reveal that ion and electron transport resistances are greatly reduced in m fcdi investigation on the currents in m fcdi suggests irreversible energy consumption would be decreased as there is no current in the flow channel continuous desalting performance over 24 h of m fcdi remained stable due to the joint effect of increasing current and concentration gradient along with cumulate salt in electrode moreover interface optimization with different specifications of mesh ameliorates desalination performance owing to the larger effective charge transfer area hence to further optimize fcdi future work should focus on understanding of the process on the novel membrane electrode interface for instance the fluid state of slurry changed due to a rough surface of current collector which lead to the change of boundary layer near membrane region as ionic transport is related to electromigration and diffusion in the boundary layer simulating the flowing and local electric field would help taking in the driving force and transport path of the ion and electron

18544,this study employed a titanium mesh membrane assembly mma as the current collector in flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi device designated as m fcdi and obtained a much reduced charge transport distance as compared to traditional fcdi with plate shaped current collectors located far from the exchange membrane the average salt removal rate of m fcdi was greatly improved by 76 under 10 wt carbon content than the control experiment with graphite plate as current collector and the charge efficiency remained over 75 even under low carbon loading this improvement was attributed to the reduced resistance as revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests further investigation on fcdi s performance with different specifications of titanium meshes showed that the implementation of mma could provide a larger effective electron transfer area which would lead to better desalting performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization flow electrode mesh membrane assembly charge transport desalination 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging technology as it greatly facilitates energy efficient cost effective and eco friendly desalination process and has been applied in brackish water desalination and removing pollutants from waste streams and contaminated water to alleviate global water stress anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 in a cdi process ions migrate from saline water to electrode and store in electric double layers with an external electric field as the driving force generally the electrode of cdi is porous materials such as activated carbon carbon aerogels activated carbon cloth and ordered mesoporous carbon in particular flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi has attracted increasing attention in recent years for its continuous desalination ability and high adsorption capacity jeon et al 2013 porada et al 2014 different from the static electrodes in conventional cdi and membrane capacitive deionization mcdi an fcdi system utilizes the suspension of flow electrodes composed of porous activated carbon and electrolyte that normally flows in the channel carved on the current collectors during the desalination the electrode adsorbs ions while flowing in the channel simultaneously the electrodes are regenerated by mixing of positive and negative slurries outside the device without an extra discharging period it was demonstrated in a number of studies that the properties and carbon content of the electrode the concentration of electrolyte and operation mode all affect the desalination performance of fcdi park et al 2016 porada et al 2014 yang et al 2016 among which the slurry electrode is of great importance in fcdi the slurry electrode is responsible for conducting both the ions and the electrons specifically the ions transport through the liquid mediator and double layers at particle interface and the electrons through the mobile conduct net of the solid phase dennison et al 2014b kastening 1988 the carbon content of slurry electrode in previous researches mostly lies within a range of 5 wt to 20 wt given the fact that more carbon content would promote ion removal by facilitating electronic charge transfer bian et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 but bring extra difficulties for electrodes flow choo et al 2017 many studies so far have focused on the optimization of slurry electrode characteristics additional substances such as aqueous hydroquinone and benzoquinone ma et al 2016 carbon black liang et al 2017 and micro sized plate shaped graphite yang et al 2017 were employed in the flow electrodes to increase the conductivity some other studies achieved increased carbon loading in the flow electrodes by optimizing the rheological properties of the slurry electrode up to 28 wt of carbon content was introduced by using chemical oxidation of granular activated carbon hatzell et al 2015 even larger carbon loading of 35 wt was employed with functional groups in activated carbon and increased the salt removal efficiency from 8 to 28 park et al 2016 doornbusch and coworkers effectuated 35 wt of carbon loading of a flowable electrode by innovativing upflow fuidized bed mode doornbusch et al 2016 besides improvement on flow electrodes it is noticeable that the electronic charge transport in the cell is strongly associated with percolation among electrode particles and contact between activated carbon and current collector similar studies on electrochemical flow capacitors efcs that also employed carbon slurry electrodes reported a stratified charging regime along the direction from current collectors to ion exchange membranes iems in the slurry electrode for the incoherence of carbon particles dennison et al 2014b dennison et al indicated that the capacitance and conductivity of efcs slurry electrodes were closely related to cell dimensions and flow rate dennison et al 2014a hoyt et al 2016 specifically lager channel depth increased ohmic loss for longer charge transport distance in conventional fcdi the depth of plate channel is 1 2 mm which is too thick to offer an efficient charge transfer distance but this depth can hardly be decreased directly as it would restrain the electrodes flow and require increased pumping energy in order to optimize the pathway of charge transfer in the slurry electrode and to promote desalination performance this study proposed mesh membrane assembly mma in fcdi which employed the titanium mesh placed tight to the ion exchange membrane as the current collector rather than conventional graphite stainless plate charge transport distance was reduced significantly and thereby greatly increased salt removal rate desalting tests under different electrode concentrations and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements suggested that this improvement would be attributed to the much decreased system resistance and better utilization of carbon electrodes long term continuous operations for 24 h were carried out to evaluate the stability of desalting performance 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental setup
