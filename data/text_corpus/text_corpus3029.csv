15145,sustainable water pollution control requires understanding of historical trajectories and spatial characteristics of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from wastewater treatment plants wwtps which remains inadequately studied here we establish plant level monthly operational emissions inventories of china s wwtps in 2009 2019 we show that urban wastewater treatment has been enhanced with 80 more chemical oxygen demand being removed annually however this progress is associated with 180 more ghg emissions at the national level up to 58 3 mt co2 eq in 2019 we found significant seasonality in ghg emissions increasing sludge yield and electricity intensity became primary drivers after 2015 because of stricter standards causing ghg emissions increase 12 9 and 8 3 until 2019 ghg emissions from urban wastewater treatment show high spatial difference at province city and plant levels with different sludge disposal and energy mix approaches combined with different influent and effluent conditions in wwtps across china stricter effluent standard resulted in similar ghg emissions growth pattern in cities we argue wwtps focus on resource recovery in developed areas and higher operational efficiency in developing areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gas wastewater treatment plants historical trajectory driving forces spatial inequality data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps capacity has increased rapidly in china over the past decades to reduce water pollution qu et al 2019 the total treatment capacity in 2019 was 63 billion m3 which was the largest of any country in the world mohurd 2020 the proportion of effluent discharge reaching class 1a i e a tier stricter than most of standards worldwide table s1 increased from 6 in 2007 to 56 in 2017 smith et al 2019 68 of ghg emissions from china s water utility were contributed by wastewater treatment between 2006 and 2012 and this proportion kept an increasing trend mo and zhang 2012 zhang et al 2017 according to edgar v6 0 dataset direct ghg emissions from wwtps take up 3 of global ghg emissions in 2018 and ch4 and n2o emissions from wwtps are reported to be 12 and 4 of the global ch4 and n2o emissions respectively crippa et al 2019 as such wastewater treatment plays an important role in achieving sustainable development as water pollution control and climate change mitigation are two of the 17 united nation sustainable development goals union 2019 to clarify the ghg emissions generated during wwtp operation in china some historical operation ghg emissions inventories have been constructed ghg emissions from wwtps are estimated to be 13 mt co2 eq in 2012 by combining bottom up and top down approaches and the emissions contribution of direct emissions energy consumption and sludge treatment and disposal std was 30 28 and 6 zhang et al 2017 a firm level emissions inventory constructed estimated ghg emissions from wwtps were 30 mt co2 eq in 2019 wang et al 2022 however ghg emissions from std were underestimated which were not accounted or estimated by assuming the same emissions amount per unit of cod removal in china in fact an evaluation of estimated to result in considerable 19 mt co2 eq emissions in 2015 fang et al 2019 additionally time interval of those nationwide inventories is one year which cannot reveal seasonal fluctuation and influence existing in wwtps demir and yapicioglu 2019 moreover as stressed in china s national working conference on ecological and environmental protection in 2021 it is essential to understand the nexus between pollutant removal and ghg emissions in wastewater treatment which relates with specific operating conditions and efficiency yapicioglu and yesilnacar 2022 but not discussed in previous research on nationwide inventory research stricter effluent standards and low influent cod concentration are found to result in more electricity consumptions which is an important ghg emissions source of wwtps a study showed that the average ghg intensity of eight chinese wwtps reaching class 1a was 17 kg co2 eq kg po4 3 eq removed 1 5 times that of four wwtps reaching class 1b zhu et al 2013 life cycle analysis through theoretical models indicates that the ghg emissions in wwtps with nutrient removal are more than three times those with organic matter removal only because of nitrogen removal rahman et al 2016 nitrogen removal results in significant n2o emissions yapicioglu and demir 2020 and n2o emissions from wwtps contributed to 5 6 of china s national n2o emissions in 2014 ncsc 2018 advanced technologies such as membrane filtration used to meet stricter standards also consume much electricity rahman et al 2016 an estimation based on operational data of 4980 wwtps revealed that upgrading effluent discharge standard from class 1b to class 1a could result in 2 36 greater electricity use for china s wwtps smith et al 2019 i e a significant augment of indirect ghg emissions moreover influent cod lower than designed value usually results in more ghg emissions yapicioglu and demir 2021 electricity consumption of wwtps in china is estimated to reduce by at least 20 if influent cod increases to more than 500 mg l niu et al 2019 note that the average influent cod concentration of wwtps in china 262 mg l is only 0 7 times the european level 400 mg l cao et al 2019 however previous nationwide studies on ghg emissions from std only discussed the differences between std methods but did not discuss the impact of wwtp operating conditions on sludge amount fang et al 2019 equality is a key principle of policy making in environmental protection in china but few studies examine the ghg emissions in wwtps in regions of different development levels indeed equality is considered in water pollution control e g the wastewater treatment rate in counties and cities was required to reach 85 and 95 respectively by 2020 and cities in developed regions e g beijing tianjin hebei region should accomplish it one year in advance state council of china 2015 ghg inequality have been reported to be related with population groups and regional economy mi et al 2020 but ghg inequality in industrial sectors such as wastewater treatment was rarely concerned in fact significant effects of technology disparity in provinces on local ghg emissions have been recognized ghg emissions factors of wwtps can vary between 190 and 600 g co2 eq m3 wastewater among provinces hua et al 2022 while specific impact of operation conditions are not elucidated the one size fits all wastewater treatment policies may result in more ghg emissions from wwtps in developing areas because of lower operational efficiency gude 2021 zhang et al 2021 which in turn exacerbate the vulnerability of the poor therefore the inequality in ghg emissions needs to be assessed to support informed decision making in ghg emissions control this study establishes a ghg emissions inventory for china s wwtps from 2009 to 2019 to the best of our knowledge this inventory for the first time covers real monthly plant level operational data that support further analysis on seasonality and relationship between operating conditions and wastewater quality also in advance of previous research we include std amount and technology data besides water quality electricity consumption and chemical consumption data of china s wwtps to reveal key factors increasing ghg emissions from wwtps we examine corresponding increase patterns and socioeconomic drivers we explore regional differences and influencing factors of ghg emissions and define a functional unit gini fu gini coefficient to quantify the inequality in ghg intensity between wwtps the findings help understand the nationwide trade offs and synergies between water pollution control and climate change mitigation across space and time 2 materials and methods the overview of the study method is shown in fig 1 2 1 data sources operational data for wwtps is obtained from the national urban wastewater treatment management information portal mhurd 2020 this portal contains detailed monthly operational data for municipal wwtps in 27 provinces and 4 municipalities i e 31 areas of china except hong kong macao and taiwan monthly data is available for the period from 2009 to 2019 the database includes 5458 wwtps in 2019 the operational data includes information of location operation time process technology types including std methods applied and operating conditions see details in table s2 the database includes six kinds of influent and effluent water quality indices they are chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod suspended solids ss ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp these indices in effluent are used for identifying the standard of wwtp effluent table s1 the standards stipulated in china also include other indices such as animal and vegetable oils petroleum etc these additional indices are not recorded in the database and the six known indexes are the most representative indices for wastewater smith et al 2019 therefore other indices are not considered in this study effluent of a wwtp is considered to reach a standard when all six indices meet the standard cities are further classified into 3 scales according to their population table s3 2 2 accounting approach 2 2 1 system boundaries this research applies bottom up procedures to estimate ghg emissions of wwtp i e calculate the operating ghg emissions every month and then sum up fig 2 shows the system boundaries there are three scopes for ghg accounting bhatia and ranganathan 2004 scope 1 refers to direct ghg emissions from owned or controlled sources scope 2 refers to indirect ghg emissions from the generation of consumed electricity scope 3 refers to indirect ghg emissions from sources not owned or controlled five ghg sources are considered from the three scopes they are 1 direct emissions from wastewater collection and treatment scope 1 2 direct emissions from discharged treated wastewater scope 1 3 sludge treatment and disposal std most are direct emissions belonging to scope 1 liu et al 2013 electricity consumption in wwtps excluded 4 electricity use scope 2 including electricity consumption of sludge treatment 5 chemical use scope 3 including chemicals for phosphorus removal gizaw et al 2021 and carbon source ghg emissions from the construction phase of wwtps takes up about 10 35 of life cycle ghg emissions of wwtps mo and zhang 2012 tangsubkul et al 2005 which are often neglected rodriguez garcia et al 2011 ghg emissions from the demolishing and disposal phase are estimated to be negligible and total ghg emissions were found to be mainly related with ghg emissions from operation phase lundie et al 2004 therefore only the operational phase is included in the system boundary the interprovincial electricity transmission loss is not accounted for because the data is not available and the loss is not more than 3 zhang and chen 2020 so the effect is limited as electricity consumption takes up more than 80 of energy use in approximately 86 of wwtps in the us carlson and walburger 2007 energy use other than electricity consumption is not taken into account reclaimed water reuse is not accounted for because only 16 of treated wastewater was reused in 2017 china urban water association 2018 and it also needs to be pumped with electricity consumption for water supply which is also the most important ghg emissions source for clean water supply smith et al 2016 2 2 2 ghg emissions inventories the ghg emissions inventories are constructed virtually following the life cycle thinking and iso 14040 44 methodological guidelines iso 2006 which uses the corresponding emissions factor for bottom up calculation eq 1

use and kg ad for other emissions sources cfi j k indicates the type j ghg ch4 n2o or co2 eq life cycle emissions factor of activity of type i in process k kg ghg mwh or kg ad gwp j is the global warming potential of type j ghg kg co2 eq kg ghg and table s24 shows the specific value the specific ghg sources determine the specific meaning of adi k and different cfi j k in each process for ghg source 1 and 3 wwtps use different technologies table s4 for ghg source 2 destination of wwtps discharge varies table s5 for ghg source 4 the energy mix differs between provinces china electric power press 2018 and cfi j k of power generation technologies varies table s6 and for ghg source 5 every wwtp uses a specific type and amount of chemical ch4 and n2o emissions are the main type of scope 1 emissions in wastewater collection and treatment and in discharge of treated wastewater ch4 can be generated from wastewater collection systems dissolved in wastewater and liberated in wwtps and anaerobic process part and n2o can be generated from nitrification or nitrification denitrification processes in wwtps ipcc 2022 2019 note that n2o emissions factor in this process can be affected by dissolved oxygen no2 nh4 ph and toxic compounds duan et al 2021 which are not recorded in the database therefore we apply default emissions factors ipcc 2022 2019 carbon dioxide co2 emissions in wastewater treatment process are mostly generated from biogenic organic matter in human excreta or food waste and this part of emissions do not represent a transfer of carbon from the lithosphere to the atmosphere therefore they should not be considered ipcc 2022 2019 for ghg emissions from std electricity use and chemical use we cite the total ghg emissions factors in previous research tables s4 and s6 for electricity use in china interprovincial electricity transmission accounted for 18 of total generated electricity in 2017 for provinces the proportion of imported electricity from other provinces can be between 0 2 tibet and 62 beijing china electricity council 2018 therefore the electricity used by the wwtp comes from both the province it is located in and other provinces the electricity imported from other provinces is assumed to be generated by corresponding province i e no secondary electricity transmission china electric power yearbook provides electricity generation and use in china every year the annual compilation of statistics of power industry china electricity council 2018 provides the data of interprovincial electricity transmission in 2017 and it is assumed to be the same all the years nevertheless some transmission data are not between provinces but between regional grids or between a regional grid and a province and this kind of data is disaggregated table s7 shows the name of the regional grids the provinces they include and the abbreviations of the provinces for a regional grid importing electricity the disaggregation is based on the share of power consumption of the provinces served by this regional grid in the case of exporting electricity the electricity is disaggregated by referring to the proportion of power generation of the corresponding provinces fig s1 shows the interprovincial electricity transmission in 2017 based on the weighting method the final emissions factor cfk of electricity use in a province is calculated by eqs 2 and 3 as ghg type of electricity use in the data are all co2 eq gwpi is 1 2 c f k s e l f i i c f i r k i 3 c f k c f k s e l f e k g e n e r a t e d e k e x p o r t e d j s k c f

from province j to province k s refers to the set of china s provinces for ghg intensity two kinds of functional unit are usually adopted the volume of treated wastewater 1 m3 treated wastewater rahman et al 2016 and the removal of contaminants including cod removal 1 kg removed cod niu et al 2019 and eutrophication potential removal 1 kg po4 3 eq rodriguez garcia et al 2011 we choose cod removal as functional unit i e represent ghg intensity by ghg emissions per unit of removed cod because the function of the wwtps is to meet the regulations on pollutant concentration for discharged wastewater and it has been proved to reflect more reasonable operation efficiency of the wwtps niu et al 2019 moreover it also benefits further index decomposition analysis to figure out the driving forces related with both contaminant removal and operation efficiency as most of china s wwtp mainly apply chemicals to remove phosphorus qu et al 2019 applying eutrophication potential removal as functional unit can result in meaningless result of ghg intensity from electricity use 2 3 driving forces indicators to quantify and compare different driving forces logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi is applied to conduct index decomposition analysis lmdi can decompose the change of a variable into quantity indicators and intensity indicators related with the variable ang 2015 this method was commonly used for studies on environmental pressures to assist policy making guan et al 2018 in this study ghg emissions from wwtps of china are decomposed as in eq 4 as ghg emissions sources of low proportion discharged treated wastewater and chemical use are not included 4 g h g t o t a l g h g t r e a t g h g s l u d g e g h g e l e c p v p m v g h g t r e a t m s m g h g s l u d g e s e m g h

from wastewater collection and treatment std and electricity use v is the amount of treated wastewater m is the removed amount of cod s is the amount of treated and disposed sludge e is electricity consumption amount thus ghg total is decomposed by three quantity factors and six intensity indicators three quantity factors are related with the amount of contaminants as described as follows p is population q v p is the treated volume of wastewater per capita reflecting combined effect of water usage behavior wastewater collection and treatment rate ratio of mixed industrial wastewater and inflow infiltration exfiltration of sewerage systems cao et al 2019 c m v is cod removal i e average reduced concentration of cod it represents the condition of removing contaminant in wastewater two intensity factors are related with the amount of electricity use and sludge to be treated and disposed per unit of removed cod described as follows i sludge s m is sludge yield i e treated and disposed sludge per unit of removed cod during wastewater treatment i elec e m is electricity intensity i e electricity use per unit of removed cod three emissions factors are considered as follows f treat ghg treat m is direct emissions factor from wastewater collection and treatment it mainly reflects the ratio of cod and tn removal as most of the emissions factors of ch4 and n2o are the same f sludge ghg sludge s is std emissions factor from sludge treatment and disposal reflecting the variation of ratio of different std approaches f elec ghg elec e is electricity use emissions factor reflecting the changes of energy mix in the provinces therefore the change of the total ghg emissions from wwtps in china in year t compared with that of year t 1 can be represented by eq 5 5 δ g h g

attached in supplementary information 2 4 correlation analysis correlation analysis is conducted to address the relationship between ghg emissions and quality of influent and effluent wastewater as illustrated in 2 3 ghg emissions are integrated results decided by quantity factors intensity factors and emissions factors intensity factors indicate the operational efficiency of the wwtps and they have nonlinear and diversified correlation with wastewater quality to further explore niu et al 2019 in comparison quantity factors have direct linear relationship with wastewater quality and emissions factors are fixed indices with specific technology therefore the correlation analysis focus on relationship between intensity factors and wastewater quality two approaches are applied for correlation analysis first we derive distribution of correlation coefficient between intensity factors and wastewater quality in each wwtp to quantify the effect of wastewater quality on operation conditions second we analyze correlation between annual average intensity factors and average wastewater quality in cities to quantify the effect of spatial difference in influent and effluent wastewater quality 2 5 ghg inequality indicators gini coefficient gini 1921 is a common indicator quantifying the difference in the income distribution the basic income gini coefficient is represented by eq 6 6 g k 1 k d k y k 2 k 1 k d k 1 p k 1 where g is the gini coefficient and t is the theil index k denotes the number of groups and n denotes the number of individuals dk yk and pk respectively represent the proportion of the population the proportion of income and the cumulative income proportion of group k k 1 2 3 k and yi is the income proportion of individual i i 1 2 3 n gini coefficient range from zero to one zero means absolutely equal while one means completely unequal and larger value means more inequality some researches replace the income with carbon emissions intensity to figure out inequality of it but most of them focus on the inequality among people i e regarding an individual as a functional unit mi et al 2020 both regarding a wwtp as an individual wwtp gini or regarding one functional unit as an abstract individual fu gini can be applied to quantify the ghg emissions inequality of wwtps we choose fu gini because it is more reliable for policy design and feasibility of agreement while wwtp gini ignores the scale difference of wwtps making the result deviate from the actual inequality as an extreme example if there are only 2 wwtps in a city one removes 1 105 t cod a year and the other removes 2000 t cod a year and the ghg intensity of the latter is 4 times that of the former the corresponding wwtp gini is 0 3 while the fu gini is 0 05 as the former wwtp contributes 93 of total ghg emissions the latter wwtp s contribution to inequality is quite limited and fu gini is preferred to quantify the inequality we also quantified the inequality of sludge yield and electricity use by replacing the income with sludge yield and electricity intensity the code of the calculation is attached in supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 increasing ghg emissions from china s wwtps considerable progress has been achieved in wastewater treatment in china the volume of treated wastewater has increased 1 1 times from 2009 to 2019 the mass of pollutants removed by wastewater treatment has also increased as measured by six indices of pollutants cod bod ss nh3 n tn and tp shown in fig 3 a a total of 14 7 million t cod 1 5 million t nh3 n 1 5 million t tn and 0 2 million t tp were removed during wastewater treatment in 2019 which was an increase of 0 8 1 3 1 4 and 1 4 times respectively over the preceding decade driven by stricter effluent discharge standards fig s2 the growth of nh3 n tn and tp reduction was faster than the growth of treated water volume fig s3 this study shows that the total ghg emissions from five main sources in wwtps increased by 1 8 times between 2009 and 2019 which is 6 times the growth rate of ghg emissions from all sectors unep and unep dtu partnership 2020 and is higher than the growth rates of treated wastewater volume or pollutants removed therefore both increased pollutant removal and changes in ghg intensity result in the growth in ghg emissions from wwtps china has become the largest ghg emitter of wwtps in the world the ghg emissions from wwtps in 2019 were estimated to be 58 3 mt co2 eq which were 1 3 times and 3 3 times of those in the united states us us environmental protection agency 2020 and the european union respectively european environment agency eea 2021 the ghg emissions in 2016 were estimated to be 42 1 mt co2 eq 10 7 mt co2 eq more than a previous study guo et al 2019 because we take std into account average ghg emissions per cubic wastewater were 0 807 kg co2 eq m3 in 2011 3 8 times that of china s urban water supply smith et al 2016 according to results in 2019 std contributed the largest share of emissions 47 of the total emission followed by electricity use 26 wastewater collection and treatment from scope 1 emissions 20 discharged treated wastewater 4 and chemical use 3 fig 3b the proportion of ghg emissions from std is significantly higher than the results in previous studies for example it is 28 in a single wwtp yapicioglu 2021 while that from other sources is similar to the results of previous studies yapicioglu 2021 this is because we applied real nationwide operational std data and life cycle ghg emissions from std are included ghg emissions from std increased 3 1 times between 2009 and 2019 the largest increase of all five processes ghg intensity of total emissions and each emissions source show significant seasonality every month fig 3c see details in table s8 3 2 drivers of increasing ghg emissions from wwtps we quantified eight drivers of growing ghg emissions from wwtps by applying the lmdi as shown in fig 4 a wastewater per capita was found to be a key contributor of increased ghg emissions during the entire studied period and it was also the top driver 8 6 in the latest period 2017 2019 in other words more wastewater is now collected to be treated per capita of population in china from 64 7 m3 capita in 2009 to 94 6 m3 capita in 2019 increasing the overall volume of wastewater treated and the ghg produced in the process it can be attributed to an increase in the demand and coverage rate of wastewater collection and treatment fig s4 the main driving forces of increasing ghg emissions in the wastewater sector changed significantly from 2015 population increase was an important driver before 2015 which dominated 25 1 increase in ghg emissions between 2009 and 2015 in the absence of other factors population growth would have caused emissions increase by 11 0 7 4 and 6 7 during the periods 2009 2011 2011 2013 and 2013 2015 respectively changes in the std emissions factor ghg emissions per unit of treated sludge was the other critical force pushing ghg emissions upward in 2009 2011 7 4 2011 2013 1 9 and 2013 2015 8 5 due to the popularization of sludge incineration and building materials utilization recorded in the database fig s5 which corresponds with the policy guidance in china ndrc 2021 as for the period 2015 2019 sludge yield sludge generated per unit of removed cod and electricity intensity electricity consumed per unit of removed cod became important driving forces 12 9 and 8 3 respectively and stricter effluent standards can be an important cause of this transformation fig s2 smith et al 2019 state council of china 2015 because ubiquitous negative correlation exist between these two variables and effluent water quality indices in most of the wwtps fig s6 and across cities table s9 higher demand on tn and tp removal results in increased generated amount of biological sludge and chemical sludge and tighter standards requires more advanced technologies consuming more electricity decreasing electricity use emissions factor ghg emissions per unit of consumed electricity and cod removal removed cod per unit of water volume are by contrast slowing the growth rate of ghg emissions but less cod removal contributed by lower influent cod increased ghg intensity a reduction in the emissions factor for electricity generation is due to more utilization of low carbon energy e g solar and wind energy in china despite the introduction of a stricter effluent discharge standard cod removal decreased as shown in fig s3 mainly due to steady decline in influent cod concentration which seemed to reduce wastewater treatment burden and abate total amount of ghg emissions however the lower influent cod concentration may be related to growing rainwater inflow groundwater infiltration and exfiltration iie problems in china s sewerage cao et al 2019 as the lower influent cod and bod concentration reduced influent cod tn and bod tn ratio fig s7a the efficiencies of denitrification and biological phosphorus removal are undermined cao et al 2019 which increased the likelihood of higher electricity intensity and adding external carbon source for nutrient removal in wwtps and finally increase ghg intensity figs s2 s6 and table s9 moreover the decrease of total emissions contributed by decrease of cod removal and the reduction of electricity use emissions factor 1 7 between 2017 and 2019 cannot offset the increase contributed by other drivers the increasing pattern and main drivers of ghg emissions in cities of different scales changed after 2015 see table s3 for the criteria of city scale classification between 2009 and 2015 fig 4b ghg emissions growth in smaller cities and counties was quicker than in bigger cities 2 4 times of increase in counties but only 0 4 times in megacities fig s7 wastewater per capita acted as the main driving force in counties 185 due to the development of wastewater collection and treatment facilities the contribution of population to growing ghg emissions was greater in cities 73 than in counties 18 reflecting the effect of population concentrating in bigger cities through urbanization std emissions factor was also an important driving force of ghg emissions in bigger cities due to rapid transformation in std methods fig s8 for cities of different scales between 2015 and 2019 the difference of the growth rates of ghg emissions lessened and the effect of driving forces became more similar fig 4c in the absence of other factors sludge yield and electricity intensity would have driven ghg emissions up by 27 36 and 12 20 respectively in cities of different scales wastewater per capita was still the top driver of ghg emission growth in counties but its contribution became lessened 60 3 3 spatial inequality of ghg intensity from wwtps ghg intensity difference caused by local conditions is regarded as ghg inequality for discussion of ensuring fairness in ghg emissions reduction mi et al 2020 according to plant level results we find significant spatial differences of ghg intensity or ghg inequality from wwtps affected by local conditions 3 3 1 province wise ghg inequality ghg intensity varied across provinces fig 5 in general ghg intensity in more developed eastern provinces was higher than that of less developed western provinces the higher ghg intensity might be driven by the higher effluent quality which increases sludge yield and electricity intensity as the correlation relationships were strong between gdp and effluent quality sludge yield electricity intensity and weak between gdp and most of influent index s concentration with as shown in table s10 upgrading the effluent standard from class 1b to class 1a increased sludge yield and electricity intensity by 17 and 12 respectively on average fig s9 in 2019 zhejiang province had the highest ghg intensity 6 34 kg co2 eq kg cod removed it was 3 8 times that in yunnan province and 1 6 times the national average jiangsu province emit the most ghg 6 75 mt ghg intensity in wealthier provinces tends to be higher where more wwtps have been upgraded to advanced processes facilitated by better economic situation and motivated by worse water environmental carrying capacity jia et al 2018 std methods and energy mix have a strong impact on the ghg intensity by influencing emissions factors i e ghg emissions per unit of sludge disposal and electricity use for example the contribution to ghg intensity from std in shanghai is greater than in beijing though with similar sludge yield table s11 this is because sanitary landfill and incineration are the most common methods of std in shanghai which have higher emissions factors than the dominating land application method adopted in beijing fig s9 ghg intensity from electricity use in beijing is much greater than shanghai though their electricity intensity values are similar table s11 electricity used in beijing is mainly from thermal power by comparison most electricity supplied to shanghai is from sichuan 21 and hubei 16 where electricity is mainly from hydropower with a much lower electricity emissions factor important effects of std methods and energy mix are because std and electricity use were the key sources of ghg emissions for almost all provinces for instance ghg emissions from std make up 67 of total ghg emissions in zhejiang and ghg emissions from electricity use contribute the most in beijing 48 3 3 2 city wise ghg inequality a few cities contribute to a disproportionately large ratio of the total emissions for example 7 megacities from 1975 mega big and small cities are responsible for 14 of total ghg emissions in 2019 with 8 4 of china s population greater mass of contaminant removal in bigger cities contributes to this imbalance e g beijing shenzhen and shanghai were the top 3 cities in terms of both pollutant removal and ghg emissions from wwtps table s12 the wastewater volumes in these developed cities are greater due to larger populations and higher wastewater treatment rates owing to more developed sewerage networks a greater mass of contaminants is removed due to stricter standard and higher influent cod concentrations figs s10 and s11 the influent cod concentration is high due to wider implementation of separate sewers table s13 thus preventing rainwater inflow and better pipe condition thanks to better economy and technology which reduces groundwater infiltration and wastewater exfiltration however ghg intensity ghg emission per unit of removed cod in bigger cities tends to be lower due to lower sludge yield and electricity intensity because of relatively higher influent cod concentration fig 6 and s12 in 2019 the average sludge yield and electricity intensity were 0 49 kg kg cod removed and 0 98 kwh kg cod removed in wwtps with 400 450 mg l influent cod concentration and 0 74 kg kg cod removed and 1 83 kwh kg cod removed in wwtps with 150 200 mg l influent cod concentration this is because less wastewater dilution by abnormal influent and infiltration decreases hydraulic load and reduces energy use for pumping dirckx et al 2016 also higher influent cod tn ratio combined with higher influent cod raises tn removal efficiency ge et al 2010 lowers sludge yield liu et al 1999 and decreases ghg emissions from std 3 3 3 plant wise ghg inequality functional unit gini coefficient fu gini is defined to quantify the difference in ghg intensity among wwtps taking advantage of plant level data the fu gini coefficient of total wwtp ghg inequality in china has increased from 0 20 in 2009 to 0 29 in 2019 fig 7 at the provincial level fu gini coefficient increased in 22 and 24 of 31 provinces including municipalities in the periods 2009 2015 and 2015 2019 respectively tables s14 s16 the fu gini coefficient of cities of different scales also increased table s17 therefore increasingly significant heterogeneity of ghg emissions from wwtps should be concerned in ghg management at the national provincial and urban levels sensitivity analysis proves robustness of this result as the variation of total wwtp ghg inequality would not exceed 3 3 with 10 variation of any emissions factors and the growing trend of fu gini still hold table s18 diversifying std methods fig s5 and changing energy mix are the main causes of the increasing inequality in ghg intensity with china keeping promoting centralized sludge incineration for disposal ndrc 2021 and low carbon energy the fu gini coefficient of ghg emissions from std increased 0 11 in the period 2009 2019 being 0 24 higher than fu gini coefficient of sludge yield in 2019 it is worth noting that the progress of upgrading effluent standard and increase of electricity intensity in 2013 2015 was faster in provinces with higher electricity use emissions factors i e in provinces with more consumption of electricity generated by coal see details in table s15 this further deepened the inequality in ghg intensity from electricity use the fu gini coefficients of ghg emissions from electricity use increased by 0 03 being 0 05 higher than that of electricity intensity in 2019 in contrast sludge yield and electricity intensity inequalities have declined across space and time as stricter standards have been rolled out in china see statistical analysis in tables s16 s23 for details which is similar to the relationship between decreased carbon inequality and economic growth mi et al 2020 4 conclusion this study established plant level monthly ghg emissions inventories of china s wwtps operation in 2009 2019 we identified key driving forces of ghg emissions increase and affecting factors of spatial ghg difference and discussed how they are influenced by related policy the following are the major findings a enhancing operational efficiency to reducing sludge yield and electricity intensity has become the most critical importance for nationwide ghg emissions control b addressing iie problems can increase influent contaminant concentration and thus enhance operation efficiency which is a promising synergetic solution to tackle both water pollution and ghg control issues despite the apparent trade off between them c the inequality in ghg emissions from wwtps becomes increasingly significant because of std methods diversification and the low carbon transition of energy mix regions mainly using thermal power should focus on electricity consumption control sludge reduction and recycling should be developed along with the promotion of sludge incineration for disposal overall we suggest tailor made roadmaps of water pollution control and ghg reduction in regions of different economic conditions for developed regions we recommend promoting 1 thermal and chemical energy recovery as the operational efficiency is already high and 2 sludge reducing and recycling such as anaerobic sludge digestion for developing regions we suggest 3 providing policies to empower wwtp operation 4 considering the trade off relationship between ghg emission control and water pollution control and 5 prioritizing tackling the iie problem e g by constructing more separated sewerage system especially in new developed areas and rehabilitating sewerage systems future nationwide studies can focus on direct co2 emissions from fossil organic carbon and n2o emissions in wastewater treatment process which are ignored in this study because of undeveloped accounting methods emissions factors and data source ipcc

15145,sustainable water pollution control requires understanding of historical trajectories and spatial characteristics of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from wastewater treatment plants wwtps which remains inadequately studied here we establish plant level monthly operational emissions inventories of china s wwtps in 2009 2019 we show that urban wastewater treatment has been enhanced with 80 more chemical oxygen demand being removed annually however this progress is associated with 180 more ghg emissions at the national level up to 58 3 mt co2 eq in 2019 we found significant seasonality in ghg emissions increasing sludge yield and electricity intensity became primary drivers after 2015 because of stricter standards causing ghg emissions increase 12 9 and 8 3 until 2019 ghg emissions from urban wastewater treatment show high spatial difference at province city and plant levels with different sludge disposal and energy mix approaches combined with different influent and effluent conditions in wwtps across china stricter effluent standard resulted in similar ghg emissions growth pattern in cities we argue wwtps focus on resource recovery in developed areas and higher operational efficiency in developing areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gas wastewater treatment plants historical trajectory driving forces spatial inequality data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps capacity has increased rapidly in china over the past decades to reduce water pollution qu et al 2019 the total treatment capacity in 2019 was 63 billion m3 which was the largest of any country in the world mohurd 2020 the proportion of effluent discharge reaching class 1a i e a tier stricter than most of standards worldwide table s1 increased from 6 in 2007 to 56 in 2017 smith et al 2019 68 of ghg emissions from china s water utility were contributed by wastewater treatment between 2006 and 2012 and this proportion kept an increasing trend mo and zhang 2012 zhang et al 2017 according to edgar v6 0 dataset direct ghg emissions from wwtps take up 3 of global ghg emissions in 2018 and ch4 and n2o emissions from wwtps are reported to be 12 and 4 of the global ch4 and n2o emissions respectively crippa et al 2019 as such wastewater treatment plays an important role in achieving sustainable development as water pollution control and climate change mitigation are two of the 17 united nation sustainable development goals union 2019 to clarify the ghg emissions generated during wwtp operation in china some historical operation ghg emissions inventories have been constructed ghg emissions from wwtps are estimated to be 13 mt co2 eq in 2012 by combining bottom up and top down approaches and the emissions contribution of direct emissions energy consumption and sludge treatment and disposal std was 30 28 and 6 zhang et al 2017 a firm level emissions inventory constructed estimated ghg emissions from wwtps were 30 mt co2 eq in 2019 wang et al 2022 however ghg emissions from std were underestimated which were not accounted or estimated by assuming the same emissions amount per unit of cod removal in china in fact an evaluation of estimated to result in considerable 19 mt co2 eq emissions in 2015 fang et al 2019 additionally time interval of those nationwide inventories is one year which cannot reveal seasonal fluctuation and influence existing in wwtps demir and yapicioglu 2019 moreover as stressed in china s national working conference on ecological and environmental protection in 2021 it is essential to understand the nexus between pollutant removal and ghg emissions in wastewater treatment which relates with specific operating conditions and efficiency yapicioglu and yesilnacar 2022 but not discussed in previous research on nationwide inventory research stricter effluent standards and low influent cod concentration are found to result in more electricity consumptions which is an important ghg emissions source of wwtps a study showed that the average ghg intensity of eight chinese wwtps reaching class 1a was 17 kg co2 eq kg po4 3 eq removed 1 5 times that of four wwtps reaching class 1b zhu et al 2013 life cycle analysis through theoretical models indicates that the ghg emissions in wwtps with nutrient removal are more than three times those with organic matter removal only because of nitrogen removal rahman et al 2016 nitrogen removal results in significant n2o emissions yapicioglu and demir 2020 and n2o emissions from wwtps contributed to 5 6 of china s national n2o emissions in 2014 ncsc 2018 advanced technologies such as membrane filtration used to meet stricter standards also consume much electricity rahman et al 2016 an estimation based on operational data of 4980 wwtps revealed that upgrading effluent discharge standard from class 1b to class 1a could result in 2 36 greater electricity use for china s wwtps smith et al 2019 i e a significant augment of indirect ghg emissions moreover influent cod lower than designed value usually results in more ghg emissions yapicioglu and demir 2021 electricity consumption of wwtps in china is estimated to reduce by at least 20 if influent cod increases to more than 500 mg l niu et al 2019 note that the average influent cod concentration of wwtps in china 262 mg l is only 0 7 times the european level 400 mg l cao et al 2019 however previous nationwide studies on ghg emissions from std only discussed the differences between std methods but did not discuss the impact of wwtp operating conditions on sludge amount fang et al 2019 equality is a key principle of policy making in environmental protection in china but few studies examine the ghg emissions in wwtps in regions of different development levels indeed equality is considered in water pollution control e g the wastewater treatment rate in counties and cities was required to reach 85 and 95 respectively by 2020 and cities in developed regions e g beijing tianjin hebei region should accomplish it one year in advance state council of china 2015 ghg inequality have been reported to be related with population groups and regional economy mi et al 2020 but ghg inequality in industrial sectors such as wastewater treatment was rarely concerned in fact significant effects of technology disparity in provinces on local ghg emissions have been recognized ghg emissions factors of wwtps can vary between 190 and 600 g co2 eq m3 wastewater among provinces hua et al 2022 while specific impact of operation conditions are not elucidated the one size fits all wastewater treatment policies may result in more ghg emissions from wwtps in developing areas because of lower operational efficiency gude 2021 zhang et al 2021 which in turn exacerbate the vulnerability of the poor therefore the inequality in ghg emissions needs to be assessed to support informed decision making in ghg emissions control this study establishes a ghg emissions inventory for china s wwtps from 2009 to 2019 to the best of our knowledge this inventory for the first time covers real monthly plant level operational data that support further analysis on seasonality and relationship between operating conditions and wastewater quality also in advance of previous research we include std amount and technology data besides water quality electricity consumption and chemical consumption data of china s wwtps to reveal key factors increasing ghg emissions from wwtps we examine corresponding increase patterns and socioeconomic drivers we explore regional differences and influencing factors of ghg emissions and define a functional unit gini fu gini coefficient to quantify the inequality in ghg intensity between wwtps the findings help understand the nationwide trade offs and synergies between water pollution control and climate change mitigation across space and time 2 materials and methods the overview of the study method is shown in fig 1 2 1 data sources operational data for wwtps is obtained from the national urban wastewater treatment management information portal mhurd 2020 this portal contains detailed monthly operational data for municipal wwtps in 27 provinces and 4 municipalities i e 31 areas of china except hong kong macao and taiwan monthly data is available for the period from 2009 to 2019 the database includes 5458 wwtps in 2019 the operational data includes information of location operation time process technology types including std methods applied and operating conditions see details in table s2 the database includes six kinds of influent and effluent water quality indices they are chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod suspended solids ss ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp these indices in effluent are used for identifying the standard of wwtp effluent table s1 the standards stipulated in china also include other indices such as animal and vegetable oils petroleum etc these additional indices are not recorded in the database and the six known indexes are the most representative indices for wastewater smith et al 2019 therefore other indices are not considered in this study effluent of a wwtp is considered to reach a standard when all six indices meet the standard cities are further classified into 3 scales according to their population table s3 2 2 accounting approach 2 2 1 system boundaries this research applies bottom up procedures to estimate ghg emissions of wwtp i e calculate the operating ghg emissions every month and then sum up fig 2 shows the system boundaries there are three scopes for ghg accounting bhatia and ranganathan 2004 scope 1 refers to direct ghg emissions from owned or controlled sources scope 2 refers to indirect ghg emissions from the generation of consumed electricity scope 3 refers to indirect ghg emissions from sources not owned or controlled five ghg sources are considered from the three scopes they are 1 direct emissions from wastewater collection and treatment scope 1 2 direct emissions from discharged treated wastewater scope 1 3 sludge treatment and disposal std most are direct emissions belonging to scope 1 liu et al 2013 electricity consumption in wwtps excluded 4 electricity use scope 2 including electricity consumption of sludge treatment 5 chemical use scope 3 including chemicals for phosphorus removal gizaw et al 2021 and carbon source ghg emissions from the construction phase of wwtps takes up about 10 35 of life cycle ghg emissions of wwtps mo and zhang 2012 tangsubkul et al 2005 which are often neglected rodriguez garcia et al 2011 ghg emissions from the demolishing and disposal phase are estimated to be negligible and total ghg emissions were found to be mainly related with ghg emissions from operation phase lundie et al 2004 therefore only the operational phase is included in the system boundary the interprovincial electricity transmission loss is not accounted for because the data is not available and the loss is not more than 3 zhang and chen 2020 so the effect is limited as electricity consumption takes up more than 80 of energy use in approximately 86 of wwtps in the us carlson and walburger 2007 energy use other than electricity consumption is not taken into account reclaimed water reuse is not accounted for because only 16 of treated wastewater was reused in 2017 china urban water association 2018 and it also needs to be pumped with electricity consumption for water supply which is also the most important ghg emissions source for clean water supply smith et al 2016 2 2 2 ghg emissions inventories the ghg emissions inventories are constructed virtually following the life cycle thinking and iso 14040 44 methodological guidelines iso 2006 which uses the corresponding emissions factor for bottom up calculation eq 1 1 e f k i i j j a d i k c f i j k g w p j where efk denotes the ghg emissions of process k kg co2 eq adi k l represents the activity amount of type i in process k mwh for emissions from electricity use and kg ad for other emissions sources cfi j k indicates the type j ghg ch4 n2o or co2 eq life cycle emissions factor of activity of type i in process k kg ghg mwh or kg ad gwp j is the global warming potential of type j ghg kg co2 eq kg ghg and table s24 shows the specific value the specific ghg sources determine the specific meaning of adi k and different cfi j k in each process for ghg source 1 and 3 wwtps use different technologies table s4 for ghg source 2 destination of wwtps discharge varies table s5 for ghg source 4 the energy mix differs between provinces china electric power press 2018 and cfi j k of power generation technologies varies table s6 and for ghg source 5 every wwtp uses a specific type and amount of chemical ch4 and n2o emissions are the main type of scope 1 emissions in wastewater collection and treatment and in discharge of treated wastewater ch4 can be generated from wastewater collection systems dissolved in wastewater and liberated in wwtps and anaerobic process part and n2o can be generated from nitrification or nitrification denitrification processes in wwtps ipcc 2022 2019 note that n2o emissions factor in this process can be affected by dissolved oxygen no2 nh4 ph and toxic compounds duan et al 2021 which are not recorded in the database therefore we apply default emissions factors ipcc 2022 2019 carbon dioxide co2 emissions in wastewater treatment process are mostly generated from biogenic organic matter in human excreta or food waste and this part of emissions do not represent a transfer of carbon from the lithosphere to the atmosphere therefore they should not be considered ipcc 2022 2019 for ghg emissions from std electricity use and chemical use we cite the total ghg emissions factors in previous research tables s4 and s6 for electricity use in china interprovincial electricity transmission accounted for 18 of total generated electricity in 2017 for provinces the proportion of imported electricity from other provinces can be between 0 2 tibet and 62 beijing china electricity council 2018 therefore the electricity used by the wwtp comes from both the province it is located in and other provinces the electricity imported from other provinces is assumed to be generated by corresponding province i e no secondary electricity transmission china electric power yearbook provides electricity generation and use in china every year the annual compilation of statistics of power industry china electricity council 2018 provides the data of interprovincial electricity transmission in 2017 and it is assumed to be the same all the years nevertheless some transmission data are not between provinces but between regional grids or between a regional grid and a province and this kind of data is disaggregated table s7 shows the name of the regional grids the provinces they include and the abbreviations of the provinces for a regional grid importing electricity the disaggregation is based on the share of power consumption of the provinces served by this regional grid in the case of exporting electricity the electricity is disaggregated by referring to the proportion of power generation of the corresponding provinces fig s1 shows the interprovincial electricity transmission in 2017 based on the weighting method the final emissions factor cfk of electricity use in a province is calculated by eqs 2 and 3 as ghg type of electricity use in the data are all co2 eq gwpi is 1 2 c f k s e l f i i c f i r k i 3 c f k c f k s e l f e k g e n e r a t e d e k e x p o r t e d j s k c f

province k kg co2 eq mwh ek generated is the generated electricity by province k mwh ek exported is the exported electricity generated by province k mwh ek j is the amount of electricity transmitted from province j to province k s refers to the set of china s provinces for ghg intensity two kinds of functional unit are usually adopted the volume of treated wastewater 1 m3 treated wastewater rahman et al 2016 and the removal of contaminants including cod removal 1 kg removed cod niu et al 2019 and eutrophication potential removal 1 kg po4 3 eq rodriguez garcia et al 2011 we choose cod removal as functional unit i e represent ghg intensity by ghg emissions per unit of removed cod because the function of the wwtps is to meet the regulations on pollutant concentration for discharged wastewater and it has been proved to reflect more reasonable operation efficiency of the wwtps niu et al 2019 moreover it also benefits further index decomposition analysis to figure out the driving forces related with both contaminant removal and operation efficiency as most of china s wwtp mainly apply chemicals to remove phosphorus qu et al 2019 applying eutrophication potential removal as functional unit can result in meaningless result of ghg intensity from electricity use 2 3 driving forces indicators to quantify and compare different driving forces logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi is applied to conduct index decomposition analysis lmdi can decompose the change of a variable into quantity indicators and intensity indicators related with the variable ang 2015 this method was commonly used for studies on environmental pressures to assist policy making guan et al 2018 in this study ghg emissions from wwtps of china are decomposed as in eq 4 as ghg emissions sources of low proportion discharged treated wastewater and chemical use are not included 4 g h g t o t a l g h g t r e a t g h g s l u d g e g h g e l e c p v p m v g h g t r e a t m s m g h g s l u d g e s e m g h

from wastewater collection and treatment std and electricity use v is the amount of treated wastewater m is the removed amount of cod s is the amount of treated and disposed sludge e is electricity consumption amount thus ghg total is decomposed by three quantity factors and six intensity indicators three quantity factors are related with the amount of contaminants as described as follows p is population q v p is the treated volume of wastewater per capita reflecting combined effect of water usage behavior wastewater collection and treatment rate ratio of mixed industrial wastewater and inflow infiltration exfiltration of sewerage systems cao et al 2019 c m v is cod removal i e average reduced concentration of cod it represents the condition of removing contaminant in wastewater two intensity factors are related with the amount of electricity use and sludge to be treated and disposed per unit of removed cod described as follows i sludge s m is sludge yield i e treated and disposed sludge per unit of removed cod during wastewater treatment i elec e m is electricity intensity i e electricity use per unit of removed cod three emissions factors are considered as follows f treat ghg treat m is direct emissions factor from wastewater collection and treatment it mainly reflects the ratio of cod and tn removal as most of the emissions factors of ch4 and n2o are the same f sludge ghg sludge s is std emissions factor from sludge treatment and disposal reflecting the variation of ratio of different std approaches f elec ghg elec e is electricity use emissions factor reflecting the changes of energy mix in the provinces therefore the change of the total ghg emissions from wwtps in china in year t compared with that of year t 1 can be represented by eq 5 5 δ g h g

attached in supplementary information 2 4 correlation analysis correlation analysis is conducted to address the relationship between ghg emissions and quality of influent and effluent wastewater as illustrated in 2 3 ghg emissions are integrated results decided by quantity factors intensity factors and emissions factors intensity factors indicate the operational efficiency of the wwtps and they have nonlinear and diversified correlation with wastewater quality to further explore niu et al 2019 in comparison quantity factors have direct linear relationship with wastewater quality and emissions factors are fixed indices with specific technology therefore the correlation analysis focus on relationship between intensity factors and wastewater quality two approaches are applied for correlation analysis first we derive distribution of correlation coefficient between intensity factors and wastewater quality in each wwtp to quantify the effect of wastewater quality on operation conditions second we analyze correlation between annual average intensity factors and average wastewater quality in cities to quantify the effect of spatial difference in influent and effluent wastewater quality 2 5 ghg inequality indicators gini coefficient gini 1921 is a common indicator quantifying the difference in the income distribution the basic income gini coefficient is represented by eq 6 6 g k 1 k d k y k 2 k 1 k d k 1 p k 1 where g is the gini coefficient and t is the theil index k denotes the number of groups and n denotes the number of individuals dk yk and pk respectively represent the proportion of the population the proportion of income and the cumulative income proportion of group k k 1 2 3 k and yi is the income proportion of individual i i 1 2 3 n gini coefficient range from zero to one zero means absolutely equal while one means completely unequal and larger value means more inequality some researches replace the income with carbon emissions intensity to figure out inequality of it but most of them focus on the inequality among people i e regarding an individual as a functional unit mi et al 2020 both regarding a wwtp as an individual wwtp gini or regarding one functional unit as an abstract individual fu gini can be applied to quantify the ghg emissions inequality of wwtps we choose fu gini because it is more reliable for policy design and feasibility of agreement while wwtp gini ignores the scale difference of wwtps making the result deviate from the actual inequality as an extreme example if there are only 2 wwtps in a city one removes 1 105 t cod a year and the other removes 2000 t cod a year and the ghg intensity of the latter is 4 times that of the former the corresponding wwtp gini is 0 3 while the fu gini is 0 05 as the former wwtp contributes 93 of total ghg emissions the latter wwtp s contribution to inequality is quite limited and fu gini is preferred to quantify the inequality we also quantified the inequality of sludge yield and electricity use by replacing the income with sludge yield and electricity intensity the code of the calculation is attached in supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 increasing ghg emissions from china s wwtps considerable progress has been achieved in wastewater treatment in china the volume of treated wastewater has increased 1 1 times from 2009 to 2019 the mass of pollutants removed by wastewater treatment has also increased as measured by six indices of pollutants cod bod ss nh3 n tn and tp shown in fig 3 a a total of 14 7 million t cod 1 5 million t nh3 n 1 5 million t tn and 0 2 million t tp were removed during wastewater treatment in 2019 which was an increase of 0 8 1 3 1 4 and 1 4 times respectively over the preceding decade driven by stricter effluent discharge standards fig s2 the growth of nh3 n tn and tp reduction was faster than the growth of treated water volume fig s3 this study shows that the total ghg emissions from five main sources in wwtps increased by 1 8 times between 2009 and 2019 which is 6 times the growth rate of ghg emissions from all sectors unep and unep dtu partnership 2020 and is higher than the growth rates of treated wastewater volume or pollutants removed therefore both increased pollutant removal and changes in ghg intensity result in the growth in ghg emissions from wwtps china has become the largest ghg emitter of wwtps in the world the ghg emissions from wwtps in 2019 were estimated to be 58 3 mt co2 eq which were 1 3 times and 3 3 times of those in the united states us us environmental protection agency 2020 and the european union respectively european environment agency eea 2021 the ghg emissions in 2016 were estimated to be 42 1 mt co2 eq 10 7 mt co2 eq more than a previous study guo et al 2019 because we take std into account average ghg emissions per cubic wastewater were 0 807 kg co2 eq m3 in 2011 3 8 times that of china s urban water supply smith et al 2016 according to results in 2019 std contributed the largest share of emissions 47 of the total emission followed by electricity use 26 wastewater collection and treatment from scope 1 emissions 20 discharged treated wastewater 4 and chemical use 3 fig 3b the proportion of ghg emissions from std is significantly higher than the results in previous studies for example it is 28 in a single wwtp yapicioglu 2021 while that from other sources is similar to the results of previous studies yapicioglu 2021 this is because we applied real nationwide operational std data and life cycle ghg emissions from std are included ghg emissions from std increased 3 1 times between 2009 and 2019 the largest increase of all five processes ghg intensity of total emissions and each emissions source show significant seasonality every month fig 3c see details in table s8 3 2 drivers of increasing ghg emissions from wwtps we quantified eight drivers of growing ghg emissions from wwtps by applying the lmdi as shown in fig 4 a wastewater per capita was found to be a key contributor of increased ghg emissions during the entire studied period and it was also the top driver 8 6 in the latest period 2017 2019 in other words more wastewater is now collected to be treated per capita of population in china from 64 7 m3 capita in 2009 to 94 6 m3 capita in 2019 increasing the overall volume of wastewater treated and the ghg produced in the process it can be attributed to an increase in the demand and coverage rate of wastewater collection and treatment fig s4 the main driving forces of increasing ghg emissions in the wastewater sector changed significantly from 2015 population increase was an important driver before 2015 which dominated 25 1 increase in ghg emissions between 2009 and 2015 in the absence of other factors population growth would have caused emissions increase by 11 0 7 4 and 6 7 during the periods 2009 2011 2011 2013 and 2013 2015 respectively changes in the std emissions factor ghg emissions per unit of treated sludge was the other critical force pushing ghg emissions upward in 2009 2011 7 4 2011 2013 1 9 and 2013 2015 8 5 due to the popularization of sludge incineration and building materials utilization recorded in the database fig s5 which corresponds with the policy guidance in china ndrc 2021 as for the period 2015 2019 sludge yield sludge generated per unit of removed cod and electricity intensity electricity consumed per unit of removed cod became important driving forces 12 9 and 8 3 respectively and stricter effluent standards can be an important cause of this transformation fig s2 smith et al 2019 state council of china 2015 because ubiquitous negative correlation exist between these two variables and effluent water quality indices in most of the wwtps fig s6 and across cities table s9 higher demand on tn and tp removal results in increased generated amount of biological sludge and chemical sludge and tighter standards requires more advanced technologies consuming more electricity decreasing electricity use emissions factor ghg emissions per unit of consumed electricity and cod removal removed cod per unit of water volume are by contrast slowing the growth rate of ghg emissions but less cod removal contributed by lower influent cod increased ghg intensity a reduction in the emissions factor for electricity generation is due to more utilization of low carbon energy e g solar and wind energy in china despite the introduction of a stricter effluent discharge standard cod removal decreased as shown in fig s3 mainly due to steady decline in influent cod concentration which seemed to reduce wastewater treatment burden and abate total amount of ghg emissions however the lower influent cod concentration may be related to growing rainwater inflow groundwater infiltration and exfiltration iie problems in china s sewerage cao et al 2019 as the lower influent cod and bod concentration reduced influent cod tn and bod tn ratio fig s7a the efficiencies of denitrification and biological phosphorus removal are undermined cao et al 2019 which increased the likelihood of higher electricity intensity and adding external carbon source for nutrient removal in wwtps and finally increase ghg intensity figs s2 s6 and table s9 moreover the decrease of total emissions contributed by decrease of cod removal and the reduction of electricity use emissions factor 1 7 between 2017 and 2019 cannot offset the increase contributed by other drivers the increasing pattern and main drivers of ghg emissions in cities of different scales changed after 2015 see table s3 for the criteria of city scale classification between 2009 and 2015 fig 4b ghg emissions growth in smaller cities and counties was quicker than in bigger cities 2 4 times of increase in counties but only 0 4 times in megacities fig s7 wastewater per capita acted as the main driving force in counties 185 due to the development of wastewater collection and treatment facilities the contribution of population to growing ghg emissions was greater in cities 73 than in counties 18 reflecting the effect of population concentrating in bigger cities through urbanization std emissions factor was also an important driving force of ghg emissions in bigger cities due to rapid transformation in std methods fig s8 for cities of different scales between 2015 and 2019 the difference of the growth rates of ghg emissions lessened and the effect of driving forces became more similar fig 4c in the absence of other factors sludge yield and electricity intensity would have driven ghg emissions up by 27 36 and 12 20 respectively in cities of different scales wastewater per capita was still the top driver of ghg emission growth in counties but its contribution became lessened 60 3 3 spatial inequality of ghg intensity from wwtps ghg intensity difference caused by local conditions is regarded as ghg inequality for discussion of ensuring fairness in ghg emissions reduction mi et al 2020 according to plant level results we find significant spatial differences of ghg intensity or ghg inequality from wwtps affected by local conditions 3 3 1 province wise ghg inequality ghg intensity varied across provinces fig 5 in general ghg intensity in more developed eastern provinces was higher than that of less developed western provinces the higher ghg intensity might be driven by the higher effluent quality which increases sludge yield and electricity intensity as the correlation relationships were strong between gdp and effluent quality sludge yield electricity intensity and weak between gdp and most of influent index s concentration with as shown in table s10 upgrading the effluent standard from class 1b to class 1a increased sludge yield and electricity intensity by 17 and 12 respectively on average fig s9 in 2019 zhejiang province had the highest ghg intensity 6 34 kg co2 eq kg cod removed it was 3 8 times that in yunnan province and 1 6 times the national average jiangsu province emit the most ghg 6 75 mt ghg intensity in wealthier provinces tends to be higher where more wwtps have been upgraded to advanced processes facilitated by better economic situation and motivated by worse water environmental carrying capacity jia et al 2018 std methods and energy mix have a strong impact on the ghg intensity by influencing emissions factors i e ghg emissions per unit of sludge disposal and electricity use for example the contribution to ghg intensity from std in shanghai is greater than in beijing though with similar sludge yield table s11 this is because sanitary landfill and incineration are the most common methods of std in shanghai which have higher emissions factors than the dominating land application method adopted in beijing fig s9 ghg intensity from electricity use in beijing is much greater than shanghai though their electricity intensity values are similar table s11 electricity used in beijing is mainly from thermal power by comparison most electricity supplied to shanghai is from sichuan 21 and hubei 16 where electricity is mainly from hydropower with a much lower electricity emissions factor important effects of std methods and energy mix are because std and electricity use were the key sources of ghg emissions for almost all provinces for instance ghg emissions from std make up 67 of total ghg emissions in zhejiang and ghg emissions from electricity use contribute the most in beijing 48 3 3 2 city wise ghg inequality a few cities contribute to a disproportionately large ratio of the total emissions for example 7 megacities from 1975 mega big and small cities are responsible for 14 of total ghg emissions in 2019 with 8 4 of china s population greater mass of contaminant removal in bigger cities contributes to this imbalance e g beijing shenzhen and shanghai were the top 3 cities in terms of both pollutant removal and ghg emissions from wwtps table s12 the wastewater volumes in these developed cities are greater due to larger populations and higher wastewater treatment rates owing to more developed sewerage networks a greater mass of contaminants is removed due to stricter standard and higher influent cod concentrations figs s10 and s11 the influent cod concentration is high due to wider implementation of separate sewers table s13 thus preventing rainwater inflow and better pipe condition thanks to better economy and technology which reduces groundwater infiltration and wastewater exfiltration however ghg intensity ghg emission per unit of removed cod in bigger cities tends to be lower due to lower sludge yield and electricity intensity because of relatively higher influent cod concentration fig 6 and s12 in 2019 the average sludge yield and electricity intensity were 0 49 kg kg cod removed and 0 98 kwh kg cod removed in wwtps with 400 450 mg l influent cod concentration and 0 74 kg kg cod removed and 1 83 kwh kg cod removed in wwtps with 150 200 mg l influent cod concentration this is because less wastewater dilution by abnormal influent and infiltration decreases hydraulic load and reduces energy use for pumping dirckx et al 2016 also higher influent cod tn ratio combined with higher influent cod raises tn removal efficiency ge et al 2010 lowers sludge yield liu et al 1999 and decreases ghg emissions from std 3 3 3 plant wise ghg inequality functional unit gini coefficient fu gini is defined to quantify the difference in ghg intensity among wwtps taking advantage of plant level data the fu gini coefficient of total wwtp ghg inequality in china has increased from 0 20 in 2009 to 0 29 in 2019 fig 7 at the provincial level fu gini coefficient increased in 22 and 24 of 31 provinces including municipalities in the periods 2009 2015 and 2015 2019 respectively tables s14 s16 the fu gini coefficient of cities of different scales also increased table s17 therefore increasingly significant heterogeneity of ghg emissions from wwtps should be concerned in ghg management at the national provincial and urban levels sensitivity analysis proves robustness of this result as the variation of total wwtp ghg inequality would not exceed 3 3 with 10 variation of any emissions factors and the growing trend of fu gini still hold table s18 diversifying std methods fig s5 and changing energy mix are the main causes of the increasing inequality in ghg intensity with china keeping promoting centralized sludge incineration for disposal ndrc 2021 and low carbon energy the fu gini coefficient of ghg emissions from std increased 0 11 in the period 2009 2019 being 0 24 higher than fu gini coefficient of sludge yield in 2019 it is worth noting that the progress of upgrading effluent standard and increase of electricity intensity in 2013 2015 was faster in provinces with higher electricity use emissions factors i e in provinces with more consumption of electricity generated by coal see details in table s15 this further deepened the inequality in ghg intensity from electricity use the fu gini coefficients of ghg emissions from electricity use increased by 0 03 being 0 05 higher than that of electricity intensity in 2019 in contrast sludge yield and electricity intensity inequalities have declined across space and time as stricter standards have been rolled out in china see statistical analysis in tables s16 s23 for details which is similar to the relationship between decreased carbon inequality and economic growth mi et al 2020 4 conclusion this study established plant level monthly ghg emissions inventories of china s wwtps operation in 2009 2019 we identified key driving forces of ghg emissions increase and affecting factors of spatial ghg difference and discussed how they are influenced by related policy the following are the major findings a enhancing operational efficiency to reducing sludge yield and electricity intensity has become the most critical importance for nationwide ghg emissions control b addressing iie problems can increase influent contaminant concentration and thus enhance operation efficiency which is a promising synergetic solution to tackle both water pollution and ghg control issues despite the apparent trade off between them c the inequality in ghg emissions from wwtps becomes increasingly significant because of std methods diversification and the low carbon transition of energy mix regions mainly using thermal power should focus on electricity consumption control sludge reduction and recycling should be developed along with the promotion of sludge incineration for disposal overall we suggest tailor made roadmaps of water pollution control and ghg reduction in regions of different economic conditions for developed regions we recommend promoting 1 thermal and chemical energy recovery as the operational efficiency is already high and 2 sludge reducing and recycling such as anaerobic sludge digestion for developing regions we suggest 3 providing policies to empower wwtp operation 4 considering the trade off relationship between ghg emission control and water pollution control and 5 prioritizing tackling the iie problem e g by constructing more separated sewerage system especially in new developed areas and rehabilitating sewerage systems future nationwide studies can focus on direct co2 emissions from fossil organic carbon and n2o emissions in wastewater treatment process which are ignored in this study because of undeveloped accounting methods emissions factors and data source ipcc

denitrification esnd in the a o a process but its feasibility remains unexamined here we established four a o a sbrs at different c n ratios 3 7 5 12 and 16 5 to address the above mentioned knowledge

driven by phas and verified it with batch tests microbial and functional analyses suggested that cn12 favored the intracellular carbon transformation and harbored the minimum autotrophic nitrifiers supporting the dominance of esnd in the enhanced snd our findings expand the understanding of the relationships between intracellular carbon transformation and snd and provide a novel nitrogen removal

environmental problems ranging from widespread eutrophication to global acidification cheng et al 2020 the a o a process is a promising biological nitrogen removal technology to alleviate these problems due to its simple operation and utmost carbon utilization dan et al 2021 tsuneda et al 2006 the dgaos and dpaos in the a o a process could reserve the influent organics as intracellular carbon in the pre anaerobic phase and enhance the subsequent nutrient removal through post endogenous denitrification zaman et al 2021 however most studies on the a o a process aimed at improving denitrification in low c n wastewater treatment chen et al 2022 and the typical rate limiting step in many other cases nitrification was neglected duan et al 2022 thus more research should focus on enhancing nitrification for a broader application of the a o a process nitrification in the canonical a o a process is principally executed by chemolithotrophic ammonium nitrite oxidizing bacteria dan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a and their slow proliferation and high environmental susceptibility inherently restrict the efficiency and robustness of nitrification duan et al 2022 heterotrophic nitrification can overcome these shortcomings by using organic substrates as the energy source to accomplish ammonia oxidization and rapid proliferation lin et al 2022 many hnb can also perform snd to directly convert ammonium into nitrogen gas avoiding the competitions between nitrifiers and denitrifiers wang and he 2020 therefore introducing heterotrophic nitrification to the a o a process would be an efficient approach to enhancing the nitrification however heterotrophic nitrification relies on the consumption of external carbon in the current theory duan et al 2022 lin et al 2022 but most external carbon would be transformed into intracellular carbon e g phas in the a o a process dan et al 2021 since the intracellular carbon transformation could raise the carbon priority of endogenous functional microorganisms santos et al 2020 the heterotrophic nitrification driven by intracellular carbon would help achieve more efficient snd i e endogenous snd hereafter called esnd with more energy available but whether heterotrophic nitrification could be driven by intracellular carbon remains hitherto unexamined recently several hnb were reported to possess phosphate accumulating ability and assigned as sndpr bacteria including pseudomonas putida np5 yang et al 2019 thauera sp strain snd5 wang and he 2020 and acinetobacter sp strain c 13 chen et al 2021 although these studies still used external carbon to drive heterotrophic nitrification they confirmed that hnb could participate in intracellular carbon transformation moreover zhang et al 2017a successfully established a hnad system with exogenous phbv as the sole carbon source and phas are analogous biodegradable polymers to phbv implying the possibility of using intracellular carbon to drive hnad based on these reports we hypothesized that specific hnb could link intracellular carbon transformation with heterotrophic nitrification to achieve esnd in addition the c n ratio is a key factor affecting both intracellular carbon transformation and snd jia et al 2020 johnson et al 2010 scarce carbon source would impair the nitrogen removal performance huang et al 2020 while overdosing carbon source might result in carbon leakage and drop the competitive advantages of endogenous functional microorganisms santos et al 2020 therefore exploring a balance between organic supplementation and nitrogen removal is imperative for the application of esnd accordingly here we established four a o a sbrs with different c n ratios 3 7 5 12 and 16 5 to explore the overlooked nitrogen removal pathway esnd the main objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the impacts of c n ratios on the nitrogen removal performance and pathways in the a o a sbrs through water quality measurements and typical cycle tests 2 verify the contributions of esnd in the enhanced nitrogen removal by qpcr enzymatic activity analysis and batch tests 3 elucidate the potential biological mechanism of esnd via investigations of crucial microbial phylotypes and functional genes involved in intracellular carbon transformation and nitrogen metabolism this work could provide new insights into the interactions between intracellular carbon transformation and snd and facilitate the broader application of the a o a process 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation four bench scale a o a sbrs were established in parallel cylindrical vessels with an effective volume of 2 l the reactors were inoculated with 4 g l 1 activated sludge collected from an oxidation ditch in a municipal wastewater treatment plant chongqing china the temperature of the reactors was maintained at 23 2 c with an external heating jacket and the do concentration in the aerobic phase was controlled to be 3 4 mg l 1 through a gas flowmeter the mixing was provided by magnetic stirrers and the feeding decanting was conducted by peristaltic pumps equipped with time control switches all reactors were operated with 8 h cycles and each cycle contained 60 min anaerobic phase feeding in the first 2 min 80 min aerobic phase 220 min anoxic phase and 120 min settling phase decanting in the final 2 min the volumetric exchange ratio was kept at 40 resulting in a hydraulic retention time of 20 h the mlss were measured termly and maintained at 3 0 2 g l 1 through daily sludge discharge with the mean solid retention time ranging from 25 to 40 d liquid samples were collected daily during the whole experiment and at specific intervals during the typical cycle tests after stabilization synthetic wastewater was prepared for all reactors to simulate municipal wastewater with different c n ratios ayatollahi et al 2021 the synthetic medium contained acetate and starch m m 8 1 as the carbon source nh4cl as the nitrogen source kh2po4 as the phosphorous source and macro trace elements dissolved in tap water text s1 the mean influent ammonia and phosphorous concentrations in all reactors were kept at 40 and 5 mg l 1 respectively and the cod concentrations ranged from 120 to 660 mg l 1 in the four reactors making the average c n ratios to be 3 7 5 12 and 16 5 in cn3 cn7 5 cn12 and cn16 5 respectively 2 2 batch tests batch tests were conducted to evaluate the contributions of different ammonia oxidation pathways in the a o a sbrs fig 3a and divided into four groups total ammonia oxidation group tao heterotrophic nitrification group hnb control group con and endogenous heterotrophic nitrification group ehnb referring to previous literatures with modifications duan et al 2022b zhang et al 2017b specifically all test sludge was harvested at the end of the aerobic phase to prevent the hypoxia interference to nitrification activities kornaros et al 2010 and kept in aeration vessels for 30 min to deplete the stored intracellular carbon and ammonium wang et al 2020 the test sludge was then centrifuged 10 000 g 20 c for 3 min and rinsed well for three times with physiological saline 0 85 nacl to remove the adherent pollutants in addition the test sludge of the ehnb group required pre storage of intracellular carbon in 50 ml serum bottles containing 30 ml endogenous carbon storage medium after anaerobically cultured in dark for 1 h 200 rpm 30 c the test sludge of the ehnb group was re washed as mentioned above all pre treated test sludge was subsequently inoculated into 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 30 ml corresponding nitrification assay medium and cultured in dark for 2 h 150 rpm 30 c the compositions of the mediums applied in the batch tests have been described in text s2 and the specific ammonia oxidation activity mg nh4 n g 1 vss h 1 was calculated as follows 1 ammonia oxidation activity aor c 0 c e 2 mlvss where c0 and ce mg l 1 are the ammonia concentrations at the beginning and the end of the incubation respectively and the mlvss are the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids concentrations at the end of the batch tests the autotrophic nitrification activity was calculated by the total ammonia oxidation activity minus the heterotrophic nitrification activity and the endogenous heterotrophic nitrification activity was corrected by the control group in addition optimized ammonia loadings 10 mg nh4 n g 1 mlss and incubation time 2 h as well as the absence of phosphorous components were applied to reduce the ammonia assimilation duan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017b all the batch tests were conducted in triplicate 2 3 chemical analysis the cod nitrogen compounds po4 3 p mlss and mlvss were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 and the tn was defined as the summation of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n the do and ph were determined by a multi parameter analytical instrument hach hq30d usa the phas were defined as the

2000 thermo scientific wilmington usa huang et al 2020 universal primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were applied to amplify the bacterial v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna genes shi et al 2022 and the sequence data have been submitted to genome sequence archive database accession number cra007328 the operational taxonomic units otus were clustered using usearch v7 0 with 97 similarity and taxonomies for the representative otus were assigned via rdp classifier against silva database huang et al 2020 the whole hierarchical structures were visualized by graphalan v1 1 3 huang et al 2021 and the phylogenetic analysis was performed in mega v 11 0 using neighbor joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates cheng et al 2021 2 4 3 metagenome prediction and functional annotations the functional metagenomic composition of the samples were predicted by picrust2 douglas et al 2020 in brief the sequences of the 16s rrna genes were placed into a reference phylogeny via the epa ng method to predict their functions based on the database of reference genomes and gene families the outcomes were reported as kegg orthologs kos and kegg pathways and the functional annotations were conducted by searching against the kegg database the resultant kos were rarefied using the r package vegan v2 6 2 and all hits of kos associated with intracellular carbon transformation and nitrogen metabolism were retained for further functional trait analysis besides the contributions of the potential hosts to the functional genes were calculated by combining the predicted contributions of otus to specific kos and the relative abundance of the corresponding otus and the relationships were visualized via gephi v0 9 5 huang et al 2020 2 5 statistic analysis and calculation all statistic analyses were performed using spss 22 0 and r 4 0 the differences in the removal performance among the reactors were identified via nonparametric kruskal wallis test while the differences in the enzymatic activities among the reactors were determined by anova with a bootstrap method 95 bootstrap confidence intervals n 1000 the pca and rda were performed using the r package vegan v2 6 2 and the correlation analyses were conducted with the r package ggcor v0 9 the structural equation model was constructed using amos 24 0 with maximum likelihood method text s4 the co occurrence network was assembled with spearman s correlations r 0 8 p 0 01 between otus and the p value was adjusted using benjamini hochberg method shi et al 2022 the intracellular carbon transformation efficiency eintra and the contributions of paos and gaos were calculated as text s5 the ammonia assimilation was estimated by the nitrogen fraction of the waste biomass using the empirical formula of bacteria i e ch1 4o0 4n0 2p0 017 zhang et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of the a o a sbrs we characterized the cod and nutrient removal of the a o a sbrs at different c n ratios fig s1 and fig 1 all reactors achieved rapid start up within two weeks and exhibited distinct removal performance after stabilization p 0 05 kruskal wallis the cod and phosphorous removal of the a o a sbr initially increased and then decreased with the increasing c n ratio peaking at cn12 to be 95 4 and 96 4 respectively this result indicated that proper organic supplementation could facilitate the proliferation of endogenous heterotrophs e g paos and their organic utilization but organic overdose would lead to carbon leakage and secondary phosphorous release in the post anoxic phase santos et al 2020 both the nh4 n and tn removal in the a o a sbr increased with the increasing c n ratio suggesting that organic supplementation boosted nitrification and denitrification simultaneously this phenomenon contradicted autotrophic nitrification inhibited by high c n ratios and rendered obvious hnb characteristics duan et al 2022 the previous studies on the a o a process typically focused on low c n wastewater treatment applying low do to reduce the intracellular carbon consumption in the aerobic phase and enhance the post endogenous denitrification autotrophic nitrifiers without carbon requirements were thus the main nitrifiers in these a o a processes dan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a however the low do and the slow proliferation of autotrophic nitrifiers resulted in relatively low nitrification rates and long aeration time 2 5 h tab s1 despite the amendment by adding packings or controlling nitritation zhao et al 2018 in this study we applied a short aeration time 80 min and tried to introduce hnb to enhance nitrification therefore higher c n ratios favoring hnb were more conducive to the nh4 n removal in addition although the tn removal in cn16 5 was slightly higher than cn12 98 5 vs 97 8 the difference failed to reach statistical significance hence cn12 achieved the optimal carbon nitrogen and phosphorous removal 3 2 typical cycle tests 3 2 1 intracellular carbon transformation to explore the transformation of intracellular carbon and nutrients we conducted typical cycle tests after stabilization fig 2 in the anaerobic phase except cn3 possessed a low eintra of 74 due to the residual nitrate from the last cycle all the other reactors converted most influent organics into phas eintra 95 the phas storage initially increased and then decreased with the increasing c n ratio peaking at cn12 fig s2a which indicated that cn12 possessed the highest phas storage capacity paos and gaos are the principal contributors to the intracellular carbon transformation using intracellularly stored poly p and or glycogen as the sources of energy and reducing power to convert external carbon into phas mcilroy et al 2014 petriglieri et al 2022 thus the phas storage capacity depends on the organic uptake and the hydrolysis of poly p glycogen under carbon limited conditions c n 3 12 organic supplementation could increase phas storage by promoting the organic uptake wang et al 2015 but under carbon overdosed conditions c n 16 5 the hydrolysis of poly p glycogen became the rate limiting step and further increasing the c n ratio would inversely decrease the phas storage because excess external carbon could drop the competitive advantages of endogenous functional microorganisms santos et al 2020 moreover the phas consumption mainly occurred in the aerobic phase accounting for 63 6 56 7 78 1 and 88 3 in cn3 cn7 5 cn12 and cn16 5 respectively this phas consumption pattern differed from that in previous studies retaining phas for post endogenous denitrification dan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a and provided spatiotemporal coincidence for phas consumption and snd we then used a stoichiometric method to identify the main functional microorganisms involved in the intracellular carbon transformation tab s2 the δgly δphas of cn3 were similar to the gao model and much higher than the pao model the pua δphas of cn3 was lower than the pao dpao models these results suggested that the intracellular carbon transformation in cn3 was similar to the gao metabolism pattern with weak contributions from paos the δgly δphas of the other reactors lay between the dgao model and the pao model indicating that dgaos and paos cooperated in the intracellular carbon transformation of these reactors the δgly δphas increased with the increasing c n ratio 7 5 16 5 tending towards the dgao model and the nara δphas and nira δphas of cn12 and cn16 5 were similar to the dgao model these phenomena denoted that higher c n ratios favored the dgao metabolism pattern consistent with the contributions of gaos and paos calculated by the phosphate release amount fig s2b 3 2 2 nitrogen transformation nitrification was completed within 80 min in all reactors except cn3 making the average nitrification rates to be 9 6 11 6 15 9 and 12 mg nh4 n l 1 h 1 in cn3 cn7 5 cn12 and cn16 5 respectively fig s2c this outcome indicated that increasing the c n ratio 3 12 dramatically promoted the nitrification rate in contrast to the canonical theory of autotrophic nitrification autotrophic nitrifiers are generally disadvantaged in the niche competitions with heterotrophs and increasing the c n ratio would facilitate the enrichment of heterotrophs and reduce the affinity of autotrophic nitrifiers for ammonium and oxygen graham et al 2007 therefore heterotrophic nitrification probably played a vital role in the enhanced nitrification by using organics as the energy source to oxidize ammonia lin et al 2022 however heterotrophic nitrification relies on the consumption of external carbon in the current theory duan et al 2022 but the cod variations in the aerobic phase were lower than 10 mg l 1 in all reactors except cn16 5 hence the intracellularly stored phas likely served as the energy source for the heterotrophic nitrification in this study we established nitrogen mass balance to evaluate the contributions of different phases to the tn removal in the a o a sbrs tab s3 cn3 mainly removed tn in the pre anaerobic phase using the influent external carbon directly due to the carbon shortage while cn7 5 mainly removed tn in the post anoxic phase through endogenous denitrification in line with previous studies dan et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 intriguingly when the c n ratio increased to 12 the aerobic phase became the primary contributor to the tn removal and the snd efficiencies were relatively high to be 76 4 and 66 9 in cn12 and cn16 5 respectively the snd in previous a o a processes targeting low c n wastewater treatment typically had low efficiencies 35 and was mainly attributed to the ammonia assimilation and the anoxic micro environment under low do concentrations dan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a however the ammonia assimilation could unlikely cause high nitrogen loss in a short aerobic phase huang et al 2020 and the anoxic micro environment would be unstable under higher do concentrations thus the cooperation of anoxic and aerobic denitrification and the greater do gradient in the larger sludge flocs at high c n ratios could be responsible for the high efficiency snd in this study lin et al 2022 given the potential roles of endogenous heterotrophic nitrification in the snd we further used the structural equation model to assess the relationships between nitrogen transformation and phas consumption fig s3 the results showed that nh4 n and no2 n were positively correlated with phas while no3 n was negatively correlated with phas suggesting that phas consumption might be associated with ammonia oxidation in this study cheng et al 2022 moreover the standardized coefficients between nh4 n and phas were 0 33 and 0 85 in cn7 5 and cn12 respectively implying the establishment of more significant and strong correlations between ammonia oxidation and phas consumption as the c n ratio increased from 7 5 to 12 3 3 confirmation of nitrogen removal pathways 3 3 1 enzymatic activity analysis and qpcr to investigate the nitrogen removal pathway we determined the activities of key enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism and the amoa gene abundances of aob and aoa fig 3 the enzymatic activities were distinct at different c n ratios anosim r 0 772 p 0 01 and peaked at cn12 indicating that cn12 was optimal for nitrogen removal the denitrification enzymatic activities nr and nir increased with the increasing c n ratio stemming from the augmentation of electron donors roy et al 2021 while the nitrification enzymatic activities amo hao and nxr initially increased and then decreased with the increasing c n ratio consistent with the variations of the nitrification rate this phenomenon confirmed that proper organic supplementation enhanced nitrification and denitrification simultaneously the amoa gene encoding amo mainly comes from autotrophic nitrifiers aob and aoa and hnb in the wastewater treatment duan et al 2022 liu et al 2018 since lacking an efficient genomic approach to detecting the amoa genes of hnb due to their broad phylogenetic diversity lin et al 2022 we mainly quantified the amoa genes of autotrophic nitrifiers in this study the results showed that the amoa genes of aob rendered decreasing tendency with the increasing c n ratios and the amoa genes of aoa were below the detection line this outcome verified the low contributions of autotrophic nitrifiers at high c n ratios aoa was negligible in line with the findings in the previous study gwak et al 2020 therefore hnb likely played a crucial role in the enhanced nitrification enzymatic activities 3 3 2 batch tests we conducted in vitro batch tests to elucidate the contributions of hnb to the enhanced nitrification fig 4 since all the batch tests employed the same shaking speed to provide do we only used the results to estimate the relative contributions of aob and hnb but not to compare the nitrification activities at different c n ratios pan et al 2020 zhang et al 2017b considering ammonia assimilation zhang et al 2022 and ignoring the weak contributions of aoa gwak et al 2020 we quantified the relative contributions of ammonia assimilation aob and hnb to the total ammonia removal at different c n ratios fig 4c the results showed that the hnb contributions accounted for 4 7 24 7 43 7 and 35 6 in cn3 cn7 5 cn12 and cn16 5 respectively indicating that increasing the c n ratio raised the relative contribution of hnb until carbon overdose this phenomenon was consistent with the findings in sections 3 2 2 and 3 3 1 and confirmed the dominance of hnb in the enhanced nitrification at high c n ratios because ammonia assimilation is also a crucial nitrogen removal pathway of hnb sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b and atu can also partially inhibit the hnb activities duan et al 2022 the obtained hnb contributions were conservative estimates we further applied the batch tests to verify the feasibility of endogenous heterotrophic nitrification fig 4a b after excluding the interference from autotrophic nitrifiers and other factors through the inhibition of atu lin et al 2022 zhang et al 2017b and the correction of control groups the ehnb groups of all reactors except cn3 still exhibited significant nitrification activities in the absence of external organics this result validated our conjecture of the overlooked endogenous heterotrophic nitrification pathway which likely enhanced the nitrification at high c n ratios in this study however the nitrification activities in the enhb group and the hnb group should be theoretically close due to the limited external organics in the aerobic phase especially in cn12 but the nitrification activities obtained in the ehnb group only accounted for 56 of that in the hnb group the possible reasons are as follows i the batch tests had lower eintra than their parent reactors and the rinsing inevitably lost partial sludge making the intracellular carbon available in the ehnb group less than the theoretical values ii the anaerobic phase for the intracellular carbon storage could impair the nitrification enzymatic activities in the ehnb group kornaros et al 2010 overall the batch tests provided the first experimental proof that the intracellular carbon could drive heterotrophic nitrification and the esnd based on endogenous heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification was thus feasible in the a o a sbrs 3 4 insight into microbiota 3 4 1 microbiota composition the bipartite association network exhibits the differences in the microbiota compositions among the inoculum and reactor samples on otu level fig s5a we detected a total of 1908 otus among which 306 otus were unique to the inoculum suggesting an apparent microbial succession at different c n ratios cn3 harbored the most unique otus among the reactor samples indicating a highly specialized structure distinct from other reactors li et al 2022 in accord with the results of pca fig s4 meanwhile rda shows that the c n ratio exerted the largest and the least influence on cn3 and cn7 5 respectively which could be explained by the c n ratio of the wastewater treatment plant being 9 0 when we collected the inoculum the phyla widespread in wastewater treatment including proteobacteria bacteroidota chloroflexi patescibacteria acidobacteria and nitrospirota dominated in the reactors fig s5b proteobacteria harbored extensive genera associated with biological nitrogen removal ren et al 2021 and had the highest relative abundance in all reactors 44 4 60 1 bacteroidota and chloroflexi contained heterotrophs with the ability to degrade massive organics shi et al 2022 and their relative abundances showed an increasing trend with the increasing c n ratios nitrospirota as the principal nitrite oxidizer huang et al 2020 had high relative abundances in cn3 and cn7 5 5 9 7 9 but decreased to 0 1 in cn12 and cn16 5 indicating the inhibition of high c n ratios to the autotrophic nitrifiers fig 5 a illustrates the microbiota compositions on genus level typical dgaos including ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 hydrogenophaga zhang et al 2021a thauera ren et al 2021 and defluviicoccus roy et al 2021 were detected in the aoa sbrs ca competibacter dominated in all reactors 7 6 45 4 and peaked at cn12 hydrogenophaga showed the same trend with ca competibacter but thauera rendered a contrary tendency in line with ren et al 2021 s finding that thauera was more competitive at low c n ratios by utilizing soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances as the carbon source defluviicoccus dramatically declined in the reactors after inoculation denoting its competitive disadvantage in the a o a sbrs typical paos ca accumulibacter qiu et al 2022 and dpaos including dechloromonas and tetrasphaera petriglieri et al 2022 were also enriched in the reactors the summation of paos peaked at cn7 5 and further increasing the c n ratio impaired the competitiveness of paos dan et al 2021 in accordance with the stoichiometric assessment overall dgaos represented by ca competibacter dominated in the intracellular carbon transformation of the a o a sbrs and their highest abundances in cn12 indicated that cn12 was optimal for the intracellular carbon transformation nitrosomonas and nitrospira were the main aob and nob undertaking the autotrophic nitrification in the a o a sbrs huang et al 2020 nitrosomonas declined in the reactors 0 03 0 7 compared with the inoculum and decreased by over 90 as the c n ratio increased to 12 whereas nitrospira was enriched in cn3 and cn7 5 5 9 7 9 but decreased to 0 1 in cn12 and cn16 5 this outcome was consistent with the results of qpcr and batch tests indicating that autotrophic nitrifiers were significantly inhibited at high c n ratios common hnb including rhodobacter khan et al 2019 paracoccus yang et al 2022 acinetobacter duan et al 2022 and thauera wang and he 2020 were detected in the reactors rhodobacter and paracoccus declined in the reactors suggesting their competitive disadvantage under the a o a operating pattern acinetobacter was enriched in the reactors and otu 102 assigned to acinetobacter had 100 similarity to acinetobacter tandoii harboring pao sc36 zhang et al 2019 and hnb mz 5 ouyang et al 2020 fig 5b given that acinetobacter sp strain c 13 was reported to be sndpr bacteria chen et al 2021 acinetobacter could be involved in the endogenous heterotrophic nitrification besides otu 1286 assigned to thauera had 95 35 similarity to sndpr bacteria thauera sp strain snd5 wang and he 2020 and peaked at cn12 suggesting that thauera could also be a candidate for ehnb notably endogenous heterotrophic nitrification was the first proposed concept and sndpr bacteria were only potential functional microorganisms the current studies on sndpr bacteria are still scarce chen et al 2021 and their potential to be ehnb remains unclear alternatively we could not exclude the possibility of gaos participating in the endogenous heterotrophic nitrification due to the broad phylogenetic diversity of hnb duan et al 2022 and the involvement of dgaos in heterotrophic nitrification jia et al 2020 wang and he 2020 zhang et al 2022 thus the specific ehnb still requires further research by culturomics 3 4 2 microbial co occurrence pattern and environmental response we constructed a co occurrence pattern to investigate the microbial interactions fig 5c the comparison of topological characteristics between the empirical and random networks denoted non random interactions and distinct small world characteristics tab s4 positive and negative correlations in the co occurrence network typically represent synergism and antagonism respectively shi et al 2022 therefore the significantly negative correlations r 0 9 between autotrophic nitrifiers nitrosomonas and nitrospira and denitrifiers terrimonas indicated the inhibition of heterotrophs to the autotrophic nitrifiers in addition ca competibacter negatively correlated with heterotrophs including terrimonas and rhodobacter suggesting the competitions between gaos and ohos santos et al 2020 this outcome further confirmed that the decrease of phas storage and nitrification rate in cn16 5 was likely caused by niche competitions from other heterotrophs consuming external carbon pan et al 2020 fig s6 shows the relationships of potential functional microorganisms nitrogen compounds enzymatic activities and c n ratios nitrosomonas exhibited positive correlations with the effluent nh4 n r 0 96 p 0 05 and negative correlations with amo r 0 99 p 0 01 and hao activities r 0 97 p 0 05 this phenomenon broke the positive linkage between autotrophic nitrifiers and ammonia oxidation indicating low contributions of autotrophic nitrifiers to the enhanced nitrification moreover hao activities positively correlated with phas storage r 1 00 p 0 001 and phas consumption r 0 98 p 0 01 implying the occurrence of endogenous heterotrophic nitrification driven by phas 3 4 3 functional annotation we further performed functional annotation for the microbiota fig 6 and fig s7 acs and phaabc sequentially catalyze the phas synthesis while phaz catalyzes the phas depolymerization zhang et al 2020 the corresponding functional genes acs k01895 and phac k03821 peaked at cn12 and cn7 5 indicating that carbon shortage or excess hindered the phas storage johnson et al 2010 the phac was mainly assigned to ca competibacter in all reactors except cn3 60 0 87 3 suggesting the dominance of ca competibacter in phas storage however the phaz decreased by 70 80 as the c n ratio increased to 12 denoting that cn12 and cn16 5 favored phas accumulation due to surplus carbon and energy zhang et al 2020 phas are converted into accoa enter the tca cycle to produce nadh and transfer electrons to the respiratory chain via complex ⅰ accompanied by the generation of proton motive force to synthesize atp through oxphos ren et al 2021 the enhanced tca cycle and oxphos in cn12 laid the energy foundation for the high esnd efficiency fig s8 the amoa k10944 and hao k10535 had the lowest relative abundance in cn12 and cn16 5 after eliminating the interference from the pmoa orthologous to the amoa manually diamond et al 2022 in accord with the qpcr results because the amo and hao of hnb cannot be identified by the kegg database lin et al 2022 liu et al 2018 the obtained low amoa and hao indicated the low contributions of autotrophic nitrifiers the nxra encoding nxr and narg encoding nr are orthologous so we used narg affiliated with nitrospira to estimate the nxra huang et al 2020 the nxra decreased by 98 as the c n ratio increased to 12 denoting that high c n ratios also inhibited autotrophic nitrite oxidization and the considerable nxr activity in cn12 likely originated from hnb lin et al 2022 nr nap nir nor and nos sequentially catalyze denitrification zhang et al 2020 the coexistence of narg and napa typically indicated the cooperation of anoxic aerobic denitrification shi et al 2022 cn12 possessed the highest narg and the lowest napa suggesting that anoxic denitrification dominated in cn12 despite the highest hnb contribution in accord with the observations of liu et al 2018 which could be ascribed to larger sludge flocs and more anoxic micro environment in cn12 most genes associated with denitrification were assigned to ca competibactor verifying its dominance in the endogenous denitrification only nosz was mainly assigned to thauera and terimonas consistent with the findings in previous studies that the enrichment of ca competibactor decreased nosz dockx et al 2022 3 5 potential mechanism and implications in this study we increased the c n ratio of the a o a sbr and found that organic supplementation boosted nitrification and denitrification simultaneously until organic overdose exacerbated niche competitions from other non functional heterotrophs the results of qpcr batch tests and microbial analysis all indicated the inhibition of high c n ratios to the autotrophic nitrifiers and heterotrophic nitrification thus dominated in the enhanced nitrification at high c n ratios lin et al 2022 liu et al 2018 given the high hnb contribution 43 7 and low cod variation 10 mg l 1 in the snd 76 4 of cn12 we proposed a novel snd pathway based on heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification driven by intracellular carbon phas esnd and verified its feasibility in the batch tests vide ante section 3 3 2 ehnb and dgaos likely cooperated in the esnd storing the external carbon as phas in the anaerobic phase and utilizing phas as the carbon and energy source to execute endogenous heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification in the aerobic phase fig 7 notably because many hnb possess aerobic denitrification capacity and sndpr bacteria are potential candidates for ehnb the ehnb could also be capable to achieve endogenous denitrification and phosphorous removal simultaneously however the specific functional microorganisms involved in the esnd still require further research by culturomics due to the limited genomic approach for hnb detection chen et al 2021 duan et al 2022 overall the esnd linked intracellular carbon transformation with heterotrophic nitrification and provided a novel nitrogen removal pathway for the a o a process expanding its application scenarios the esnd could take the advantages of hnb to enhance the performance and robustness of nitrification duan et al 2022 and optimize the carbon allocation to achieve more efficient and stable nitrogen removal in high strength municipal wastewater treatment santos et al 2020 meanwhile due to the rapid proliferation and high environmental resistance of hnb the esnd was expected to be feasible to treat other high strength wastewater under unfavorable conditions such as high temperature and high ammonia loadings lin et al 2022 pan et al 2020 in addition the ehnb itself could also be promising in the bioaugmentation of simultaneous carbon and nutrient removal systems for its potential to alleviate the physiological conflicts between different functional microorganisms chen et al 2021 wang and he 2020 yang et al 2019 thus the biokinetic design and process optimization for esnd merits further research 4 conclusion organic supplementation promoted both nitrification and denitrification in the a o a sbr until organic overdose and hnb dominated in the enhanced nitrification especially in cn12 43 7 with high snd efficiency 76 4 considering negligible external organic carbon available for snd we proposed a novel esnd pathway based on heterotrophic nitrification denitrification driven by phas and verified it with batch tests microbial insights indicated that cn12 facilitated the intracellular carbon transformation and inhibited autotrophic nitrification further supporting the crucial roles of esnd in the enhanced snd performance these findings contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between intracellular carbon

15146,the anaerobic aerobic anoxic a o a process is a promising biotechnology to intensify denitrification in low carbon nitrogen c n wastewater treatment but the neglected typical rate limiting step nitrification would hinder its wider application heterotrophic nitrification driven by intracellular carbon phas could enhance nitrification and achieve endogenous simultaneous nitrification and denitrification esnd in the a o a process but its feasibility remains unexamined here we established four a o a sbrs at different c n ratios 3 7 5 12 and 16 5 to address the above mentioned knowledge gaps the results showed that organic supplementation promoted both nitrification and denitrification performance and relevant enzymatic activities until organic overdose c n 16 5 exacerbated niche

driven by phas and verified it with batch tests microbial and functional analyses suggested that cn12 favored the intracellular carbon transformation and harbored the minimum autotrophic nitrifiers supporting the dominance of esnd in the enhanced snd our findings expand the understanding of the relationships between intracellular carbon transformation and snd and provide a novel nitrogen removal

environmental problems ranging from widespread eutrophication to global acidification cheng et al 2020 the a o a process is a promising biological nitrogen removal technology to alleviate these problems due to its simple operation and utmost carbon utilization dan et al 2021 tsuneda et al 2006 the dgaos and dpaos in the a o a process could reserve the influent organics as intracellular carbon in the pre anaerobic phase and enhance the subsequent nutrient removal through post endogenous denitrification zaman et al 2021 however most studies on the a o a process aimed at improving denitrification in low c n wastewater treatment chen et al 2022 and the typical rate limiting step in many other cases nitrification was neglected duan et al 2022 thus more research should focus on enhancing nitrification for a broader application of the a o a process nitrification in the canonical a o a process is principally executed by chemolithotrophic ammonium nitrite oxidizing bacteria dan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a and their slow proliferation and high environmental susceptibility inherently restrict the efficiency and robustness of nitrification duan et al 2022 heterotrophic nitrification can overcome these shortcomings by using organic substrates as the energy source to accomplish ammonia oxidization and rapid proliferation lin et al 2022 many hnb can also perform snd to directly convert ammonium into nitrogen gas avoiding the competitions between nitrifiers and denitrifiers wang and he 2020 therefore introducing heterotrophic nitrification to the a o a process would be an efficient approach to enhancing the nitrification however heterotrophic nitrification relies on the consumption of external carbon in the current theory duan et al 2022 lin et al 2022 but most external carbon would be transformed into intracellular carbon e g phas in the a o a process dan et al 2021 since the intracellular carbon transformation could raise the carbon priority of endogenous functional microorganisms santos et al 2020 the heterotrophic nitrification driven by intracellular carbon would help achieve more efficient snd i e endogenous snd hereafter called esnd with more energy available but whether heterotrophic nitrification could be driven by intracellular carbon remains hitherto unexamined recently several hnb were reported to possess phosphate accumulating ability and assigned as sndpr bacteria including pseudomonas putida np5 yang et al 2019 thauera sp strain snd5 wang and he 2020 and acinetobacter sp strain c 13 chen et al 2021 although these studies still used external carbon to drive heterotrophic nitrification they confirmed that hnb could participate in intracellular carbon transformation moreover zhang et al 2017a successfully established a hnad system with exogenous phbv as the sole carbon source and phas are analogous biodegradable polymers to phbv implying the possibility of using intracellular carbon to drive hnad based on these reports we hypothesized that specific hnb could link intracellular carbon transformation with heterotrophic nitrification to achieve esnd in addition the c n ratio is a key factor affecting both intracellular carbon transformation and snd jia et al 2020 johnson et al 2010 scarce carbon source would impair the nitrogen removal performance huang et al 2020 while overdosing carbon source might result in carbon leakage and drop the competitive advantages of endogenous functional microorganisms santos et al 2020 therefore exploring a balance between organic supplementation and nitrogen removal is imperative for the application of esnd accordingly here we established four a o a sbrs with different c n ratios 3 7 5 12 and 16 5 to explore the overlooked nitrogen removal pathway esnd the main objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the impacts of c n ratios on the nitrogen removal performance and pathways in the a o a sbrs through water quality measurements and typical cycle tests 2 verify the contributions of esnd in the enhanced nitrogen removal by qpcr enzymatic activity analysis and batch tests 3 elucidate the potential biological mechanism of esnd via investigations of crucial microbial phylotypes and functional genes involved in intracellular carbon transformation and nitrogen metabolism this work could provide new insights into the interactions between intracellular carbon transformation and snd and facilitate the broader application of the a o a process 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation four bench scale a o a sbrs were established in parallel cylindrical vessels with an effective volume of 2 l the reactors were inoculated with 4 g l 1 activated sludge collected from an oxidation ditch in a municipal wastewater treatment plant chongqing china the temperature of the reactors was maintained at 23 2 c with an external heating jacket and the do concentration in the aerobic phase was controlled to be 3 4 mg l 1 through a gas flowmeter the mixing was provided by magnetic stirrers and the feeding decanting was conducted by peristaltic pumps equipped with time control switches all reactors were operated with 8 h cycles and each cycle contained 60 min anaerobic phase feeding in the first 2 min 80 min aerobic phase 220 min anoxic phase and 120 min settling phase decanting in the final 2 min the volumetric exchange ratio was kept at 40 resulting in a hydraulic retention time of 20 h the mlss were measured termly and maintained at 3 0 2 g l 1 through daily sludge discharge with the mean solid retention time ranging from 25 to 40 d liquid samples were collected daily during the whole experiment and at specific intervals during the typical cycle tests after stabilization synthetic wastewater was prepared for all reactors to simulate municipal wastewater with different c n ratios ayatollahi et al 2021 the synthetic medium contained acetate and starch m m 8 1 as the carbon source nh4cl as the nitrogen source kh2po4 as the phosphorous source and macro trace elements dissolved in tap water text s1 the mean influent ammonia and phosphorous concentrations in all reactors were kept at 40 and 5 mg l 1 respectively and the cod concentrations ranged from 120 to 660 mg l 1 in the four reactors making the average c n ratios to be 3 7 5 12 and 16 5 in cn3 cn7 5 cn12 and cn16 5 respectively 2 2 batch tests batch tests were conducted to evaluate the contributions of different ammonia oxidation pathways in the a o a sbrs fig 3a and divided into four groups total ammonia oxidation group tao heterotrophic nitrification group hnb control group con and endogenous heterotrophic nitrification group ehnb referring to previous literatures with modifications duan et al 2022b zhang et al 2017b specifically all test sludge was harvested at the end of the aerobic phase to prevent the hypoxia interference to nitrification activities kornaros et al 2010 and kept in aeration vessels for 30 min to deplete the stored intracellular carbon and ammonium wang et al 2020 the test sludge was then centrifuged 10 000 g 20 c for 3 min and rinsed well for three times with physiological saline 0 85 nacl to remove the adherent pollutants in addition the test sludge of the ehnb group required pre storage of intracellular carbon in 50 ml serum bottles containing 30 ml endogenous carbon storage medium after anaerobically cultured in dark for 1 h 200 rpm 30 c the test sludge of the ehnb group was re washed as mentioned above all pre treated test sludge was subsequently inoculated into 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 30 ml corresponding nitrification assay medium and cultured in dark for 2 h 150 rpm 30 c the compositions of the mediums applied in the batch tests have been described in text s2 and the specific ammonia oxidation activity mg nh4 n g 1 vss h 1 was calculated as follows 1 ammonia oxidation activity aor c 0 c e 2 mlvss where c0 and ce mg l 1 are the ammonia concentrations at the beginning and the end of the incubation respectively and the mlvss are the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids concentrations at the end of the batch tests the autotrophic nitrification activity was calculated by the total ammonia oxidation activity minus the heterotrophic nitrification activity and the endogenous heterotrophic nitrification activity was corrected by the control group in addition optimized ammonia loadings 10 mg nh4 n g 1 mlss and incubation time 2 h as well as the absence of phosphorous components were applied to reduce the ammonia assimilation duan et al 2022 zhang et al 2017b all the batch tests were conducted in triplicate 2 3 chemical analysis the cod nitrogen compounds po4 3 p mlss and mlvss were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 and the tn was defined as the summation of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n the do and ph were determined by a multi parameter analytical instrument hach hq30d usa the phas were defined as the

the abundance of aob and aoa the detailed primers and pcr procedures are provided in text s3 2 4 2 microbial community analysis the sludge samples were collected from the inoculum and the four

2000 thermo scientific wilmington usa huang et al 2020 universal primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were applied to amplify the bacterial v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna genes shi et al 2022 and the sequence data have been submitted to genome sequence archive database accession number cra007328 the operational taxonomic units otus were clustered using usearch v7 0 with 97 similarity and taxonomies for the representative otus were assigned via rdp classifier against silva database huang et al 2020 the whole hierarchical structures were visualized by graphalan v1 1 3 huang et al 2021 and the phylogenetic analysis was performed in mega v 11 0 using neighbor joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates cheng et al 2021 2 4 3 metagenome prediction and functional annotations the functional metagenomic composition of the samples were predicted by picrust2 douglas et al 2020 in brief the sequences of the 16s rrna genes were placed into a reference phylogeny via the epa ng method to predict their functions based on the database of reference genomes and gene families the outcomes were reported as kegg orthologs kos and kegg pathways and the functional annotations were conducted by searching against the kegg database the resultant kos were rarefied using the r package vegan v2 6 2 and all hits of kos associated with intracellular carbon transformation and nitrogen metabolism were retained for further functional trait analysis besides the contributions of the potential hosts to the functional genes were calculated by combining the predicted contributions of otus to specific kos and the relative abundance of the corresponding otus and the relationships were visualized via gephi v0 9 5 huang et al 2020 2 5 statistic analysis and calculation all statistic analyses were performed using spss 22 0 and r 4 0 the differences in the removal performance among the reactors were identified via nonparametric kruskal wallis test while the differences in the enzymatic activities among the reactors were determined by anova with a bootstrap method 95 bootstrap confidence intervals n 1000 the pca and rda were performed using the r package vegan v2 6 2 and the correlation analyses were conducted with the r package ggcor v0 9 the structural equation model was constructed using amos 24 0 with maximum likelihood method text s4 the co occurrence network was assembled with spearman s correlations r 0 8 p 0 01 between otus and the p value was adjusted using benjamini hochberg method shi et al 2022 the intracellular carbon transformation efficiency eintra and the contributions of paos and gaos were calculated as text s5 the ammonia assimilation was estimated by the nitrogen fraction of the waste biomass using the empirical formula of bacteria i e ch1 4o0 4n0 2p0 017 zhang et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of the a o a sbrs we characterized the cod and nutrient removal of the a o a sbrs at different c n ratios fig s1 and fig 1 all reactors achieved rapid start up within two weeks and exhibited distinct removal performance after stabilization p 0 05 kruskal wallis the cod and phosphorous removal of the a o a sbr initially increased and then decreased with the increasing c n ratio peaking at cn12 to be 95 4 and 96 4 respectively this result indicated that proper organic supplementation could facilitate the proliferation of endogenous heterotrophs e g paos and their organic utilization but organic overdose would lead to carbon leakage and secondary phosphorous release in the post anoxic phase santos et al 2020 both the nh4 n and tn removal in the a o a sbr increased with the increasing c n ratio suggesting that organic supplementation boosted nitrification and denitrification simultaneously this phenomenon contradicted autotrophic nitrification inhibited by high c n ratios and rendered obvious hnb characteristics duan et al 2022 the previous studies on the a o a process typically focused on low c n wastewater treatment applying low do to reduce the intracellular carbon consumption in the aerobic phase and enhance the post endogenous denitrification autotrophic nitrifiers without carbon requirements were thus the main nitrifiers in these a o a processes dan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a however the low do and the slow proliferation of autotrophic nitrifiers resulted in relatively low nitrification rates and long aeration time 2 5 h tab s1 despite the amendment by adding packings or controlling nitritation zhao et al 2018 in this study we applied a short aeration time 80 min and tried to introduce hnb to enhance nitrification therefore higher c n ratios favoring hnb were more conducive to the nh4 n removal in addition although the tn removal in cn16 5 was slightly higher than cn12 98 5 vs 97 8 the difference failed to reach statistical significance hence cn12 achieved the optimal carbon nitrogen and phosphorous removal 3 2 typical cycle tests 3 2 1 intracellular carbon transformation to explore the transformation of intracellular carbon and nutrients we conducted typical cycle tests after stabilization fig 2 in the anaerobic phase except cn3 possessed a low eintra of 74 due to the residual nitrate from the last cycle all the other reactors converted most influent organics into phas eintra 95 the phas storage initially increased and then decreased with the increasing c n ratio peaking at cn12 fig s2a which indicated that cn12 possessed the highest phas storage capacity paos and gaos are the principal contributors to the intracellular carbon transformation using intracellularly stored poly p and or glycogen as the sources of energy and reducing power to convert external carbon into phas mcilroy et al 2014 petriglieri et al 2022 thus the phas storage capacity depends on the organic uptake and the hydrolysis of poly p glycogen under carbon limited conditions c n 3 12 organic supplementation could increase phas storage by promoting the organic uptake wang et al 2015 but under carbon overdosed conditions c n 16 5 the hydrolysis of poly p glycogen became the rate limiting step and further increasing the c n ratio would inversely decrease the phas storage because excess external carbon could drop the competitive advantages of endogenous functional microorganisms santos et al 2020 moreover the phas consumption mainly occurred in the aerobic phase accounting for 63 6 56 7 78 1 and 88 3 in cn3 cn7 5 cn12 and cn16 5 respectively this phas consumption pattern differed from that in previous studies retaining phas for post endogenous denitrification dan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a and provided spatiotemporal coincidence for phas consumption and snd we then used a stoichiometric method to identify the main functional microorganisms involved in the intracellular carbon transformation tab s2 the δgly δphas of cn3 were similar to the gao model and much higher than the pao model the pua δphas of cn3 was lower than the pao dpao models these results suggested that the intracellular carbon transformation in cn3 was similar to the gao metabolism pattern with weak contributions from paos the δgly δphas of the other reactors lay between the dgao model and the pao model indicating that dgaos and paos cooperated in the intracellular carbon transformation of these reactors the δgly δphas increased with the increasing c n ratio 7 5 16 5 tending towards the dgao model and the nara δphas and nira δphas of cn12 and cn16 5 were similar to the dgao model these phenomena denoted that higher c n ratios favored the dgao metabolism pattern consistent with the contributions of gaos and paos calculated by the phosphate release amount fig s2b 3 2 2 nitrogen transformation nitrification was completed within 80 min in all reactors except cn3 making the average nitrification rates to be 9 6 11 6 15 9 and 12 mg nh4 n l 1 h 1 in cn3 cn7 5 cn12 and cn16 5 respectively fig s2c this outcome indicated that increasing the c n ratio 3 12 dramatically promoted the nitrification rate in contrast to the canonical theory of autotrophic nitrification autotrophic nitrifiers are generally disadvantaged in the niche competitions with heterotrophs and increasing the c n ratio would facilitate the enrichment of heterotrophs and reduce the affinity of autotrophic nitrifiers for ammonium and oxygen graham et al 2007 therefore heterotrophic nitrification probably played a vital role in the enhanced nitrification by using organics as the energy source to oxidize ammonia lin et al 2022 however heterotrophic nitrification relies on the consumption of external carbon in the current theory duan et al 2022 but the cod variations in the aerobic phase were lower than 10 mg l 1 in all reactors except cn16 5 hence the intracellularly stored phas likely served as the energy source for the heterotrophic nitrification in this study we established nitrogen mass balance to evaluate the contributions of different phases to the tn removal in the a o a sbrs tab s3 cn3 mainly removed tn in the pre anaerobic phase using the influent external carbon directly due to the carbon shortage while cn7 5 mainly removed tn in the post anoxic phase through endogenous denitrification in line with previous studies dan et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 intriguingly when the c n ratio increased to 12 the aerobic phase became the primary contributor to the tn removal and the snd efficiencies were relatively high to be 76 4 and 66 9 in cn12 and cn16 5 respectively the snd in previous a o a processes targeting low c n wastewater treatment typically had low efficiencies 35 and was mainly attributed to the ammonia assimilation and the anoxic micro environment under low do concentrations dan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a however the ammonia assimilation could unlikely cause high nitrogen loss in a short aerobic phase huang et al 2020 and the anoxic micro environment would be unstable under higher do concentrations thus the cooperation of anoxic and aerobic denitrification and the greater do gradient in the larger sludge flocs at high c n ratios could be responsible for the high efficiency snd in this study lin et al 2022 given the potential roles of endogenous heterotrophic nitrification in the snd we further used the structural equation model to assess the relationships between nitrogen transformation and phas consumption fig s3 the results showed that nh4 n and no2 n were positively correlated with phas while no3 n was negatively correlated with phas suggesting that phas consumption might be associated with ammonia oxidation in this study cheng et al 2022 moreover the standardized coefficients between nh4 n and phas were 0 33 and 0 85 in cn7 5 and cn12 respectively implying the establishment of more significant and strong correlations between ammonia oxidation and phas consumption as the c n ratio increased from 7 5 to 12 3 3 confirmation of nitrogen removal pathways 3 3 1 enzymatic activity analysis and qpcr to investigate the nitrogen removal pathway we determined the activities of key enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism and the amoa gene abundances of aob and aoa fig 3 the enzymatic activities were distinct at different c n ratios anosim r 0 772 p 0 01 and peaked at cn12 indicating that cn12 was optimal for nitrogen removal the denitrification enzymatic activities nr and nir increased with the increasing c n ratio stemming from the augmentation of electron donors roy et al 2021 while the nitrification enzymatic activities amo hao and nxr initially increased and then decreased with the increasing c n ratio consistent with the variations of the nitrification rate this phenomenon confirmed that proper organic supplementation enhanced nitrification and denitrification simultaneously the amoa gene encoding amo mainly comes from autotrophic nitrifiers aob and aoa and hnb in the wastewater treatment duan et al 2022 liu et al 2018 since lacking an efficient genomic approach to detecting the amoa genes of hnb due to their broad phylogenetic diversity lin et al 2022 we mainly quantified the amoa genes of autotrophic nitrifiers in this study the results showed that the amoa genes of aob rendered decreasing tendency with the increasing c n ratios and the amoa genes of aoa were below the detection line this outcome verified the low contributions of autotrophic nitrifiers at high c n ratios aoa was negligible in line with the findings in the previous study gwak et al 2020 therefore hnb likely played a crucial role in the enhanced nitrification enzymatic activities 3 3 2 batch tests we conducted in vitro batch tests to elucidate the contributions of hnb to the enhanced nitrification fig 4 since all the batch tests employed the same shaking speed to provide do we only used the results to estimate the relative contributions of aob and hnb but not to compare the nitrification activities at different c n ratios pan et al 2020 zhang et al 2017b considering ammonia assimilation zhang et al 2022 and ignoring the weak contributions of aoa gwak et al 2020 we quantified the relative contributions of ammonia assimilation aob and hnb to the total ammonia removal at different c n ratios fig 4c the results showed that the hnb contributions accounted for 4 7 24 7 43 7 and 35 6 in cn3 cn7 5 cn12 and cn16 5 respectively indicating that increasing the c n ratio raised the relative contribution of hnb until carbon overdose this phenomenon was consistent with the findings in sections 3 2 2 and 3 3 1 and confirmed the dominance of hnb in the enhanced nitrification at high c n ratios because ammonia assimilation is also a crucial nitrogen removal pathway of hnb sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b and atu can also partially inhibit the hnb activities duan et al 2022 the obtained hnb contributions were conservative estimates we further applied the batch tests to verify the feasibility of endogenous heterotrophic nitrification fig 4a b after excluding the interference from autotrophic nitrifiers and other factors through the inhibition of atu lin et al 2022 zhang et al 2017b and the correction of control groups the ehnb groups of all reactors except cn3 still exhibited significant nitrification activities in the absence of external organics this result validated our conjecture of the overlooked endogenous heterotrophic nitrification pathway which likely enhanced the nitrification at high c n ratios in this study however the nitrification activities in the enhb group and the hnb group should be theoretically close due to the limited external organics in the aerobic phase especially in cn12 but the nitrification activities obtained in the ehnb group only accounted for 56 of that in the hnb group the possible reasons are as follows i the batch tests had lower eintra than their parent reactors and the rinsing inevitably lost partial sludge making the intracellular carbon available in the ehnb group less than the theoretical values ii the anaerobic phase for the intracellular carbon storage could impair the nitrification enzymatic activities in the ehnb group kornaros et al 2010 overall the batch tests provided the first experimental proof that the intracellular carbon could drive heterotrophic nitrification and the esnd based on endogenous heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification was thus feasible in the a o a sbrs 3 4 insight into microbiota 3 4 1 microbiota composition the bipartite association network exhibits the differences in the microbiota compositions among the inoculum and reactor samples on otu level fig s5a we detected a total of 1908 otus among which 306 otus were unique to the inoculum suggesting an apparent microbial succession at different c n ratios cn3 harbored the most unique otus among the reactor samples indicating a highly specialized structure distinct from other reactors li et al 2022 in accord with the results of pca fig s4 meanwhile rda shows that the c n ratio exerted the largest and the least influence on cn3 and cn7 5 respectively which could be explained by the c n ratio of the wastewater treatment plant being 9 0 when we collected the inoculum the phyla widespread in wastewater treatment including proteobacteria bacteroidota chloroflexi patescibacteria acidobacteria and nitrospirota dominated in the reactors fig s5b proteobacteria harbored extensive genera associated with biological nitrogen removal ren et al 2021 and had the highest relative abundance in all reactors 44 4 60 1 bacteroidota and chloroflexi contained heterotrophs with the ability to degrade massive organics shi et al 2022 and their relative abundances showed an increasing trend with the increasing c n ratios nitrospirota as the principal nitrite oxidizer huang et al 2020 had high relative abundances in cn3 and cn7 5 5 9 7 9 but decreased to 0 1 in cn12 and cn16 5 indicating the inhibition of high c n ratios to the autotrophic nitrifiers fig 5 a illustrates the microbiota compositions on genus level typical dgaos including ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 hydrogenophaga zhang et al 2021a thauera ren et al 2021 and defluviicoccus roy et al 2021 were detected in the aoa sbrs ca competibacter dominated in all reactors 7 6 45 4 and peaked at cn12 hydrogenophaga showed the same trend with ca competibacter but thauera rendered a contrary tendency in line with ren et al 2021 s finding that thauera was more competitive at low c n ratios by utilizing soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances as the carbon source defluviicoccus dramatically declined in the reactors after inoculation denoting its competitive disadvantage in the a o a sbrs typical paos ca accumulibacter qiu et al 2022 and dpaos including dechloromonas and tetrasphaera petriglieri et al 2022 were also enriched in the reactors the summation of paos peaked at cn7 5 and further increasing the c n ratio impaired the competitiveness of paos dan et al 2021 in accordance with the stoichiometric assessment overall dgaos represented by ca competibacter dominated in the intracellular carbon transformation of the a o a sbrs and their highest abundances in cn12 indicated that cn12 was optimal for the intracellular carbon transformation nitrosomonas and nitrospira were the main aob and nob undertaking the autotrophic nitrification in the a o a sbrs huang et al 2020 nitrosomonas declined in the reactors 0 03 0 7 compared with the inoculum and decreased by over 90 as the c n ratio increased to 12 whereas nitrospira was enriched in cn3 and cn7 5 5 9 7 9 but decreased to 0 1 in cn12 and cn16 5 this outcome was consistent with the results of qpcr and batch tests indicating that autotrophic nitrifiers were significantly inhibited at high c n ratios common hnb including rhodobacter khan et al 2019 paracoccus yang et al 2022 acinetobacter duan et al 2022 and thauera wang and he 2020 were detected in the reactors rhodobacter and paracoccus declined in the reactors suggesting their competitive disadvantage under the a o a operating pattern acinetobacter was enriched in the reactors and otu 102 assigned to acinetobacter had 100 similarity to acinetobacter tandoii harboring pao sc36 zhang et al 2019 and hnb mz 5 ouyang et al 2020 fig 5b given that acinetobacter sp strain c 13 was reported to be sndpr bacteria chen et al 2021 acinetobacter could be involved in the endogenous heterotrophic nitrification besides otu 1286 assigned to thauera had 95 35 similarity to sndpr bacteria thauera sp strain snd5 wang and he 2020 and peaked at cn12 suggesting that thauera could also be a candidate for ehnb notably endogenous heterotrophic nitrification was the first proposed concept and sndpr bacteria were only potential functional microorganisms the current studies on sndpr bacteria are still scarce chen et al 2021 and their potential to be ehnb remains unclear alternatively we could not exclude the possibility of gaos participating in the endogenous heterotrophic nitrification due to the broad phylogenetic diversity of hnb duan et al 2022 and the involvement of dgaos in heterotrophic nitrification jia et al 2020 wang and he 2020 zhang et al 2022 thus the specific ehnb still requires further research by culturomics 3 4 2 microbial co occurrence pattern and environmental response we constructed a co occurrence pattern to investigate the microbial interactions fig 5c the comparison of topological characteristics between the empirical and random networks denoted non random interactions and distinct small world characteristics tab s4 positive and negative correlations in the co occurrence network typically represent synergism and antagonism respectively shi et al 2022 therefore the significantly negative correlations r 0 9 between autotrophic nitrifiers nitrosomonas and nitrospira and denitrifiers terrimonas indicated the inhibition of heterotrophs to the autotrophic nitrifiers in addition ca competibacter negatively correlated with heterotrophs including terrimonas and rhodobacter suggesting the competitions between gaos and ohos santos et al 2020 this outcome further confirmed that the decrease of phas storage and nitrification rate in cn16 5 was likely caused by niche competitions from other heterotrophs consuming external carbon pan et al 2020 fig s6 shows the relationships of potential functional microorganisms nitrogen compounds enzymatic activities and c n ratios nitrosomonas exhibited positive correlations with the effluent nh4 n r 0 96 p 0 05 and negative correlations with amo r 0 99 p 0 01 and hao activities r 0 97 p 0 05 this phenomenon broke the positive linkage between autotrophic nitrifiers and ammonia oxidation indicating low contributions of autotrophic nitrifiers to the enhanced nitrification moreover hao activities positively correlated with phas storage r 1 00 p 0 001 and phas consumption r 0 98 p 0 01 implying the occurrence of endogenous heterotrophic nitrification driven by phas 3 4 3 functional annotation we further performed functional annotation for the microbiota fig 6 and fig s7 acs and phaabc sequentially catalyze the phas synthesis while phaz catalyzes the phas depolymerization zhang et al 2020 the corresponding functional genes acs k01895 and phac k03821 peaked at cn12 and cn7 5 indicating that carbon shortage or excess hindered the phas storage johnson et al 2010 the phac was mainly assigned to ca competibacter in all reactors except cn3 60 0 87 3 suggesting the dominance of ca competibacter in phas storage however the phaz decreased by 70 80 as the c n ratio increased to 12 denoting that cn12 and cn16 5 favored phas accumulation due to surplus carbon and energy zhang et al 2020 phas are converted into accoa enter the tca cycle to produce nadh and transfer electrons to the respiratory chain via complex ⅰ accompanied by the generation of proton motive force to synthesize atp through oxphos ren et al 2021 the enhanced tca cycle and oxphos in cn12 laid the energy foundation for the high esnd efficiency fig s8 the amoa k10944 and hao k10535 had the lowest relative abundance in cn12 and cn16 5 after eliminating the interference from the pmoa orthologous to the amoa manually diamond et al 2022 in accord with the qpcr results because the amo and hao of hnb cannot be identified by the kegg database lin et al 2022 liu et al 2018 the obtained low amoa and hao indicated the low contributions of autotrophic nitrifiers the nxra encoding nxr and narg encoding nr are orthologous so we used narg affiliated with nitrospira to estimate the nxra huang et al 2020 the nxra decreased by 98 as the c n ratio increased to 12 denoting that high c n ratios also inhibited autotrophic nitrite oxidization and the considerable nxr activity in cn12 likely originated from hnb lin et al 2022 nr nap nir nor and nos sequentially catalyze denitrification zhang et al 2020 the coexistence of narg and napa typically indicated the cooperation of anoxic aerobic denitrification shi et al 2022 cn12 possessed the highest narg and the lowest napa suggesting that anoxic denitrification dominated in cn12 despite the highest hnb contribution in accord with the observations of liu et al 2018 which could be ascribed to larger sludge flocs and more anoxic micro environment in cn12 most genes associated with denitrification were assigned to ca competibactor verifying its dominance in the endogenous denitrification only nosz was mainly assigned to thauera and terimonas consistent with the findings in previous studies that the enrichment of ca competibactor decreased nosz dockx et al 2022 3 5 potential mechanism and implications in this study we increased the c n ratio of the a o a sbr and found that organic supplementation boosted nitrification and denitrification simultaneously until organic overdose exacerbated niche competitions from other non functional heterotrophs the results of qpcr batch tests and microbial analysis all indicated the inhibition of high c n ratios to the autotrophic nitrifiers and heterotrophic nitrification thus dominated in the enhanced nitrification at high c n ratios lin et al 2022 liu et al 2018 given the high hnb contribution 43 7 and low cod variation 10 mg l 1 in the snd 76 4 of cn12 we proposed a novel snd pathway based on heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification driven by intracellular carbon phas esnd and verified its feasibility in the batch tests vide ante section 3 3 2 ehnb and dgaos likely cooperated in the esnd storing the external carbon as phas in the anaerobic phase and utilizing phas as the carbon and energy source to execute endogenous heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification in the aerobic phase fig 7 notably because many hnb possess aerobic denitrification capacity and sndpr bacteria are potential candidates for ehnb the ehnb could also be capable to achieve endogenous denitrification and phosphorous removal simultaneously however the specific functional microorganisms involved in the esnd still require further research by culturomics due to the limited genomic approach for hnb detection chen et al 2021 duan et al 2022 overall the esnd linked intracellular carbon transformation with heterotrophic nitrification and provided a novel nitrogen removal pathway for the a o a process expanding its application scenarios the esnd could take the advantages of hnb to enhance the performance and robustness of nitrification duan et al 2022 and optimize the carbon allocation to achieve more efficient and stable nitrogen removal in high strength municipal wastewater treatment santos et al 2020 meanwhile due to the rapid proliferation and high environmental resistance of hnb the esnd was expected to be feasible to treat other high strength wastewater under unfavorable conditions such as high temperature and high ammonia loadings lin et al 2022 pan et al 2020 in addition the ehnb itself could also be promising in the bioaugmentation of simultaneous carbon and nutrient removal systems for its potential to alleviate the physiological conflicts between different functional microorganisms chen et al 2021 wang and he 2020 yang et al 2019 thus the biokinetic design and process optimization for esnd merits further research 4 conclusion organic supplementation promoted both nitrification and denitrification in the a o a sbr until organic overdose and hnb dominated in the enhanced nitrification especially in cn12 43 7 with high snd efficiency 76 4 considering negligible external organic carbon available for snd we proposed a novel esnd pathway based on heterotrophic nitrification denitrification driven by phas and verified it with batch tests microbial insights indicated that cn12 facilitated the intracellular carbon transformation and inhibited autotrophic nitrification further supporting the crucial roles of esnd in the enhanced snd performance these findings contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between intracellular carbon

15147,dissolved organic matter dom in river watersheds dynamically changes based on its source during a monsoon period with storm event however the variations in dom in urban and rural river watersheds that are dominated by point and non point sources have not been adequately explored to date we developed an innovative approach to reveal dom sources in complex river watershed systems during pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon periods using end member mixing analysis emma by combining multi isotope values δ13c doc δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and spectroscopic indices fluorescence index fi biological index bix humification index hix and specific uv absorbance suva several potential end members of dom sources were collected from watersheds including top soils groundwater plant group fallen leaves riparian plants suspended algae and different effluents cattle and pig livestock agricultural land urban industry facility swine treatment facility and wastewater treatment facility concentrations of dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic nitrogen no3 n and nh4 n increased during the monsoon period with an increase in the input of anthropogenic dom which have higher hix values owing to the flushing effect the results of emma indicate that soil and agricultural effluents accounted for a substantial contribution of anthropogenic dom at varying rates based on seasons we also found that results of emma based on combining spectroscopic indices and δ13c doc isotope values were more accurate in tracing dom sources with respect to land use characteristics compared to applying only spectroscopic indices the positive relationship between fi bix and δ15n no3 were revealed that nitrate would be decomposed from dom affected by intensive agricultural activities in addition consistent with the emma results the molecular composition of the dom was clearly evidenced by a large number of chon formulas accounting for over 50 of the total characterized compounds including pesticides and pharmaceuticals used in agriculture farmland and livestock our results clearly demonstrated that emma based on combing multi stable isotopes and spectroscopic indices could be trace the dom source which is important for understanding changes in the dom quality and application of nitrate isotopes and molecular analysis supports in depth interpretation this study provides easy and intuitive techniques for the estimation of the relative impacts of dom sources in complex river watersheds which can be verified in various ways rather than relying on a single technique approach graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter end member mixing model dissolved organic carbon and nitrate isotopes spectroscopic indices source identification and contribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a mixture of numerous organic compounds that occurs in various environmental matrices it plays a key role in determining the global carbon cycle and fate of organic matter through active transformation and biogeochemical reactivity battin et al 2009 bolan et al 2011 mcdonough et al 2020 shi et al 2020 the origin of dom in aquatic systems is generally classified into allochthonous and autochthonous allochthonous dom originates from soil vascular plants terrestrial debris and exogenous organic matter transported from land to rivers and streams during rainfall nguyen et al 2011 yang et al 2015 lee et al 2019 in contrast autochthonous dom is derived from algae phytoplankton macrophytes and heterotrophic organisms including bacteria and zooplankton as well as organic matter composed of detritus tank et al 2010 chen and jaffe 2014 the origin of dom entering the water system may vary depending on land use within the watershed e g agriculture cities forestry livestock and industrial complexes and the impact of storm events among others zheng et al 2020 begum et al 2022 for example considering the influence of land use the dom in agricultural land is mainly contributed by fertilizer livestock barns and livestock manure among others meanwhile in urban areas sewage treatment plants industrial wastewater etc mainly contribute to dom in forest areas the main sources of dom are leaves soil algae riparian vegetation and groundwater with regard to agricultural and urban watershed areas water flow during monsoon and heavy rainfall periods has a substantial impact on the changes in the origin of dom inamdar et al 2011 yang et al 2015 although the main water flow generally passes through groundwater during the baseflow period surface flow increases considerably during periods of high precipitation and water table rise resulting in potential changes in various dom sources derrien et al 2015 2018 lee et al 2019 in particular during monsoon period which is accompanied by frequent events of storms and heavy rainfall organic matter of natural origin such as soil riparian plants and leaves flows into the river system in large quantities in addition to point and non point sources for example anthropogenic sources dhillon and inamdar 2013 lloret et al 2013 it accounts for a sizeable portion of the annual dom contribution however little research has been conducted on the contribution of potential and various dom sources in complex river basin environments with numerous point and non point sources lee et al 2019 in order to identify the main origin of dom source during storms several previous studies have used various qualitative analysis data including spectral indices molecular weight and isotope ratio characteristics yang and hur 2014 derrien et al 2018 hawkes et al 2018 farre et al 2019 lee et al 2019 mohapatra et al 2021 begum et al 2022 duan et al 2022 the commonly used spectroscopic indices include the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 weishaar et al 2003 fluorescence index fi mcknight et al 2001 humidification index hix birdwell and engel 2010 and biological index bix huguet et al 2009 the fi has been used to distinguish terrestrial 1 2 1 5 and microbial 1 7 2 0 dom sources mcknight et al 2001 and the hix has been used to differentiate between allochthonous 16 and autochthonous 4 contributions birdwell and engel 2010 the bix has been used to distinguish allochthonous 0 6 0 7 and biological 1 dom sources huguet et al 2009 and the suva254 value has been used to differentiate between algal and bacterial 1 8 and terrestrial 3 sources weishaar et al 2003 these spectroscopic indices facilitate easy and rapid detection and are cost effective and enable the distinction between allochthonous and autochthonous origins of dom tak et al 2021 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and liquid chromatography orbitrap mass spectrometry lc orbitrap ms techniques play an important role in recent dom studies by facilitating identification of dom sources through the determination of molecular composition of dom mixtures farre et al 2019 mohapatra et al 2021 stable isotope analysis is the most effective means to trace the origin and transformation processes of organic matter the carbon stable isotope ratio δ13c is an excellent tool for tracking organic matter sources and transformation processes as it reflects the isotopic composition of local plants according to the photosynthetic pathway and land use choi ro and chang 2005 kang et al 2019 numerous previous studies have shown that the carbon stable isotope technique is a powerful tool to distinguish between allochthonous and autochthonous origins of dom lambert et al 2011 toming et al 2013 derrien et al 2018 2019 the conventional way to analyze the stable isotope ratio of dom analyzing the obtained powder after freeze drying of water samples for several days using elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometry ea irms ghandi et al 2004 lambert et al 2013 this method is inexpensive but takes substantial time in addition although the recovery rate is higher than the oven drying process the freeze drying process causes loss of volatile compounds and some organic compounds low oxygenated functional groups resulting in isotope fractionation moody c s 2020 recently an instrument that combines total organic carbon analyzer and stable isotope mass spectrometer tc tn irms has been developed in order to overcome such shortcomings it can directly analyze the isotope ratio of dom in water samples without any pre treatment freeze drying and requires small amounts in µl of samples federherr et al 2014 quantitative approaches such as linear mixed models have been applied recently to select potential dom end members and to estimate the relative contribution of the sources the iso source program provided by the us environmental protection agency epa has been frequently used traditionally because it is simple and easy to use however it does reflect the potential variability of the dom end members because it is applied mainly to the isotope ratio ye et al 2018 the stable isotope analysis in r siar model was suggested as an alternative dom source tracking technique with only isotope data menges et al 2020 the siar based end member mixing analysis emma model has been used recently to overcome this limitation lee et al 2019 tak et al 2021 it reflects the variability of dom by utilizing the fluorescence index values of the end members and effectively tracks the dom origin by evaluating the contribution rate of each source however biogeochemical processes can alter the chemical composition of the dom resulting in fluctuations in the spectral indices of the dom source and leading to uncertainty in emma results derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2020a in order to compensate for these shortcomings this study attempts a three dimensional mixed analysis for the first time in which the carbon stable isotope ratio and fluorescence index of dom are simultaneously applied to the emma model the stable isotope ratio has high accuracy and low variability in tracing the source in an aquatic environment and the emma model using the dom fluorescence index facilitates easy tracking of the complex dom sources it is expected that the new method created by combining these two methods would complement the existing problems although previous research has implemented a two dimensional approach using the spectral indices of the dom source end members this study applies a three dimensional approach by adding δ13c doc to reduce the errors enabling feasible and accurate source tracing of dom using the emma model dom and nutrients of various anthropogenic origins resulting from rapid urban development and human activities e g industrialization sewage discharge livestock agricultural activities construction and deforestation enter rivers he et al 2022 in particular owing to the increase in water inflow during the monsoon period it is difficult to identify their impacts on water bodies ryu et al 2018 shang et al 2020 therefore tracking the movement and transformation of dom in the water environment is essential to assess and improve water quality which would contribute to efficient and sustainable management in urban watersheds the objectives of this study were to 1 compare the dom properties of potential end member sources distributed in complex river basin systems 2 investigate dynamic changes in the chemical composition of dom during the rainy season monsoon using spectroscopic indices and stable isotope ratios 3 analyze the quantitative relationship between spectroscopic indices and multiple stable isotopes δ13c doc δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 using the emma model which has been demonstrated to be a simple and effective method to quantify the relative contributions of various sources and 4 estimate the relative contribution of potential dom sources regarding the novelty of this study no previous study has attempted to use the new emma model to quantitatively estimate the relative contribution of dom sources in complex water bodies where various anthropogenic dom sources exist e g effluent groups of agricultural land cattle and pig livestock urban and industrial facility wastewater and swine treatment facilities as well as natural dom sources during monsoon period including storm event this study is the first trial comprising a three dimensional emma model using δ13c doc stable isotopes and spectral indicators furthermore this study demonstrates the possible application of nitrate isotopes and lc orbitrap analyses results with regard to the identification of dom sources in complex water bodies for in depth interpretation of the three dimensional emma results 2

treatment facilities n 2 and wastewater treatment facilities n 2 were collected as potential sources in previous studies effluents from wastewater treatment plants and groundwater were selected as the sources of dom yang et al 2015 lee et al 2019 however in our study area the land use types include agricultural industrial and livestock areas and thus various sources of effluents exist therefore we added effluents as a potential source group of dom topsoil samples were collected in triplicate from the surface to a depth of 1 cm using a hand held shovel after the sample was freeze dried it was thawed and the solid substances were removed using a 500 µm nylon sieve suspended algae were collected using a plankton net and freeze dried riparian plants were collected and washed softly using deionized water to free the substances after the samples were freeze dried for few weeks they were ground using a mortar and pestle dom extraction of organic materials was performed in duplicate by combining samples using milli q water in ratios of 1 10 for soil and 1 20 for other materials followed by sonification for 24 h at 150 rpm all samples were centrifuged and supernatants were filtered

in r siar based on bayesian mixing model version 3 1 10 stock et al 2018 siar mixing models have been successfully applied for food source partitioning in consumers or the tracking of pollution source using various stable isotope ratios choi et al 2021 kim et al 2021 ryu et al 2021 although r program has been used mainly in the analysis of stable isotope ratios recently it has been used to estimate the contribution of dom using spectroscopic indices lee et al 2020b tak et al 2021 begum et al 2022 in the present study we attempted to create a novel siar model with spectroscopic indices and stable isotopes because δ13c doc unlike δ13c particulate organic carbon poc is closely related to dom to apply the end member mixing model the appropriate spectroscopic indices were selected by following the criteria established in literature derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2019 begum et al 2022 first spectroscopic indices were subtracted if the samples were beyond the range of the end member next indices with high capacities to distinguish between various dom sources were selected based on these criteria bix and fi were chosen for the end member mixing model 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality during monsoon period 3 1 1 precipitation and c and n levels during the monsoon period storm events occurred and the total amount of precipitation was 347 mm in particular a high amount of precipitation of 101 mm was recorded during storm event in the post and pre monsoon periods rainfall was much less at 202 and 111 mm respectively fig 2 a the changes in doc don tdn no3 n and nh4 n levels were significantly different among the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods p 0 05 the maximum doc level was observed during the monsoon period 77 2 mg l and was relatively low in the pre and post monsoon periods at 60 0 and 44 8 mg l respectively fig 2b this indicates that terrestrial and allochthonous dom flows into rivers from the organic rich layer as a result of the hydrological flushing of potential doc pools a tendency toward increased doc levels in streams and rivers owing to the influence of a storm event during the monsoon period has also been observed in previous studies inamdar et al 2011 dhillon and inamdar 2013 yang et al 2015 lee et al 2021b the average don tdn no3 n and nh4 n levels in the study area were the highest in the monsoon period at 0 8 7 7 5 9 and 1 0 mg l respectively and were relatively low in the pre and post monsoon periods at 0 7 3 4 2 5 and 0 1 mg l 0 3 3 1 2 5 and 0 2 mg l respectively fig 2b because n sources such as fertilizers and manures that originate from agricultural and livestock related activities which are concentrated around the miho river have a greater effect during the monsoon period ryu et al 2018 2021 increases in both doc and tdn levels during the monsoon period suggest that large amounts of terrestrial and allochthonous dom may flow into the miho river with fractions of organic and inorganic matter due to landscape disturbances 3 1 2 spectroscopic properties of dom spectroscopic indices represent the structural or chemical characteristics of dom pools such as humification allochthonous or autochthonous contribution algal or bacterial source and aromaticity in the present study the suva254 value decreased by 0 25 times in the monsoon period mean 1 56 compared to that in the pre 2 04 and post monsoon 2 00 periods suggesting a decrease in the dom aromaticity fig 3 a suva254 values increased during the monsoon period or a storm event owing to the input of aromatic structures and humified dom yang et al 2015 lee et al 2019 2020a derrien et al 2020 however our results showed contrasting trends suggesting that dom originated from fresh leaf litter or increased with the export of aromatic compounds fellman et al 2009 austnes et al 2010 yang et al 2015 much higher changes in hix values 5 15 7 59 were observed fig 3b and they increased during the monsoon period 7 59 compared to those in the pre 6 81 and post monsoon 5 15 periods which may have increased allochthonous sources owing to the flushing effect during the monsoon period bix 0 70 0 79 and fi 1 45 1 56 values showed slight increases during the monsoon period but no clear trends were observed fig 3c and d hix and bix values represent a humid feature hix 5 and a small autochthonous contribution bix 0 7 huguet et al 2009 the fi value was close to that of the terrestrial fulvic acid 1 4 and it was completely different from that of microbial fulvic acid 1 9 mcknight et al 2001 therefore the riverine dom during the monsoon period is estimated to be enriched with fresh leaf litter and have a low quantity of humified dom composition with significant fluctuations during rainfall events possibly from terrestrial or allochthonous sources a simple comparison of the spectroscopic indices between dom and various end member sources is limited in its ability to perform a qualitative evaluation of dom sources in the monsoon period owing to dynamic changes in the relative contributions of different sources however the end member mixing analyses emma model can differentiate between the contributions of different dom sources based on multiple quality indices such as spectroscopic indices and multi stable isotopes 3 2 characteristics of end member dom based on previous studies derrien et al 2020 lee et al 2020a suva254 hix bi and fi were selected as possible spectroscopic indices to trace the dom source however δ13c doc values were investigated for the first time only a few studies have compared the fluorescence characteristics of dom of end members and δ13c poc within a river watershed however to date there is no comparison of δ13c doc values 3 2 1 c and n levels and isotope values the 12 end members were divided into four groups which comprised plants soil water and effluent according to their characteristics as a respective dom source table 1 in the plant group the doc and don levels in riparian plants 33 22 and 2 28 mg g were obviously higher than those in leaves 10 21 and 0 82 mg g and algae 5 1 and 0 39 mg g the δ13c doc isotope values of riparian plants leaf and algal end members showed slight differences variations in δ13c doc are caused by the different c assimilation procedures used by microbes and plants in the river and their sources such as allochthonous and autochthonous these isotopic signatures are passed to the doc lee et al 2021b 2020c godfrey 2021 the plants group is within a similar range to that of c3 plants in previous studies with values ranging from 33 to 24 for c3 plants and 16 to 10 for c4 plants yoon et al 2016 derrien et al 2018 the soil 0 51 and 0 06 mg g and water groundwater 0 32 and 0 02 mg g groups showed the lowest doc and don concentrations among the end member groups similar c isotope values 25 3 have been reported in the soil organic matter of areas dominated by c3 plants lebreton et al 2016 lee et al 2017 in particular δ13c isotope values similar to those in our study 24 5 have been reported in the dominant reed species lambert et al 2011 in the present study organic matter derived from terrestrial plants riparian plants and soil leached organic matter that show a refractory nature and lighter δ13c values could contribute to the dom in the miho river region the δ13c doc isotope value in the groundwater end member group is relatively higher than that in the plant soil and water end member groups but showed a similar tendency to the effluent group indicating that the groundwater may have been affected by effluents the effluent groups representing various doc and don concentrations were observed in the following order swine treatment facility effluent 40 31 and 11 46 mg g cow livestock effluent 15 24 and 4 56 mg g pig livestock effluent 10 71 and 1 77 mg g wastewater treatment effluent 7 82 and 0 92 mg g industrial facility effluent 5 55 and 0 41 mg g urban effluent 3 61 and 0 28 mg g agricultural land effluent 3 52 and 0 26 mg g additionally the δ13c doc values showed in the range of 25 1 to 20 4 the differences in the δ13c doc values among effluent groups p 0 05 were attributed to their diverse origins previous studies were limited to inferring the origin of dom by analyzing δ13c poc because the δ13c of effluent dom could not be directly measured derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2021a in the present study the δ13c of dom was directly measured to determine the characteristics of each effluent type effluents from pig and cow livestock urban areas and swine treatment facilities showed relatively heavier δ15n no3 values compared to those of agricultural and wastewater treatment plants the swine treatment facility effluent showed the highest doc and don levels and it was distinguished from other end members by much heavier δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values p 0 05 previous studies have reported that sewage sewage treatment effluent swine effluent and manure inputs led to increased δ15n no3 values n contamination from swine effluent in river tributaries and mainstreams were accurately identified ryu et al 2021 our δ15n no3 value of agricultural effluent 5 8 was consistent with those of previous studies which reported that utilizing inorganic fertilizer on agricultural fields led to lighter δ15n no3 values 3 6 in the receiving waters hood et al 2014 the δ15n no3 values in effluents of wastewater treatment facility of our results are similar to those of other studies lee et al 2016 ryu et al 2021 3 2 2 spectroscopic indices within effluent groups the wastewater treatment effluent exhibited the highest bix 1 21 but lowest hix 0 95 values indicating that this end member includes large amounts of microbial sources that originated from biological treatment processes table 1 parlanti et al 2000 henderson et al 2009 the relatively higher hix 8 05 9 28 and fi 1 49 1 68 values in effluents of industrial facility urban and agricultural land suggest the intense humification of dom as opposed to algae and wastewater treatment effluents which may contain aromatic compounds mcknight et al 2001 the common fluorescence properties of the effluents of pig and cow livestock and swine treatment facility showed relatively low hix 5 71 6 84 and fi 1 65 1 82 values which indicate a significant presence of fresh biological organic matter within the plants group leaves displayed relatively low bix 0 51 and fi 1 28 values indicating a high content of humified dom chen et al 2014 in contrast riparian plants exhibited the presence of a labile fraction and low contents of humified dom and aromatics leenheer et al 2003 and relatively low hix 0 71 and suva254 0 87 values the highest fi values 2 01 were observed in algae which is in accordance with previously reported studies lee et al 2019 the lower values of bix 0 67 and fi 1 34 in soil indicates terrestrial origin with low content of biologically fresh dom groundwater dom showed relatively low suva254 0 70 and hix 3 85 values and high bix 0 87 and fi 1 88 values lee et al 2019 reported groundwater suva254 0 43 bix 0 8 and fi 2 02 values similar to those of our study yang et al 2015 showed groundwater suva254 0 97 hix 6 12 bix 0 89 and fi 1 74 values different from our research probably because of differences in regional properties plant derived or effluent derived dom our findings show that there are relatively higher levels of humification in dom of effluents of industrial facility urban and agricultural land and leaves soil and riparian plants fresh biological products dominated in the dom of effluents of pig and cow livestock and swine treatment facility 3 3 comparison between end member mixing analyses based only on spectroscopic indices and a combination of spectroscopic indices and δ13c doc emma models were applied to the fi bix and δ13c doc on 12 dom end members that individually correspond to study periods the plot of fi against bix differentiates various end members and positions samples within the range of spectroscopic indices of the end members fig 4 a specifically the fi values of all the samples 1 29 1 79 were higher than those of leaves 1 28 but lower than those of effluent of swine treatment facility 1 82 groundwater 1 88 and algae 2 01 the bix values of all the samples 0 62 0 87 were higher than those of leaves 0 51 but were less than those of the wastewater treatment facility 1 21 in addition the δ13c doc values of all monsoon samples 27 0 to 21 9 were heavier than leaf 29 7 and riparian plants 27 7 but were lighter than industrial 17 8 and swine 20 4 effluents fig 4b model 1 of emma used applied spectroscopic indices fi and bix and model 2 applied spectroscopic indices fi and bix and stable isotope δ13c doc values to track the source of dom results determined from the two models were compared to select the suitable model we hypothesized that the estimated source distribution from the miho river will be in accordance with or not significantly different from the characteristics of land use results showed that the rate of contribution during the pre monsoon period in model 1 was the highest in soil 47 9 and agricultural effluent 24 5 followed by leaves 13 4 groundwater 3 1 pig livestock effluent 1 7 and industrial effluent 1 6 fig 5 the rate of contribution differed remarkably in model 2 in the following order agricultural effluent 51 soil 33 7 industrial effluent 3 0 pig livestock effluent 2 1 and leaves 2 0 fig 5 in both models the dom of allochthonous origin affected the study area to a greater extent compared to that of autochthonous origin while soil and agricultural effluent groups were considered major sources of dom aggregate 70 the contribution rate of soil was higher in model 1 and that of agricultural effluent in model 2 the result of model 1 contrast with the high proporation 35 of auricultural area and the increasing trend of effluent groups such as livestock public wastewaer and industrial wastewater treatment facilities in the study area ministry of environment 2021 contrasting results to the pre monsoon period were generated from model 1 for the monsoon period accompanied by stormwater input fig 5 the contribution rates from the highest to lowest were as follows agricultural effluent 33 1 soil 20 3 groundwater 7 4 urban effluent 6 9 and industrial effluent 5 9 also the order of contribution rates determined by model 2 were very different between pre monsoon and monsoon periods fig 5 soil 30 4 showed the highest contribution rate followed by agricultural 17 8 industrial 8 9 urban 9 7 cow livestock 6 0 and pig livestock 6 0 effluents in both models effluents of agricultural and soil origin decreased respectively and the contribution rates of various dom sources tended to increase compared to those during the pre monsoon period the study site was located in a basin which is occupied by a greater distribution of permeable areas than urban landscapes therefore the runoff from organic matter within the topsoil during the monsoon period was considered to have an immediate influence on the study area the inflow of anthropogenic organic matter into the miho river was believed to occur during the monsoon period and this tendency was documented in previous studies yang et al 2015 lee et al 2019 derrien et al 2020 after the monsoon period the contribution rates in model 1 were as follows soil 32 0 agricultural effluent 17 1 leaf 17 5 groundwater 7 9 and riparian plants 0 44 fig 5 in model 2 for the post monsoon period the order was agricultural effluent 42 5 soil 24 5 industrial effluent 6 2 pig livestock effluent 4 4 and swine treatment facility effluent 4 4 fig 5 the proportion of soil and agricultural effluent is higher in both models but the natural source group leaves groundwater and riparian plants and effluent group were the leading sources of allochthonous organic matter in models 1 and 2 respectively this tendency is closely related to anthropogenic organic matter via surface runoff in complex river watershed areas or non point source pollutants of various origins of dom after the monsoon period with storm events inamdar et al 2011 yang et al 2015 lee et al 2019 as shown in fig 5 the estimated contributions of dom in the miho river based on the spectroscopic indices differ strongly from those based on spectroscopic indices and stable isotope ratio δ13c doc despite agriculture area accounting for the highest of land use characteristics 35 the greatest source of contribution was soil instead of agricultural effluent in model 1 probably because of the use of various end members in contrast to previous studies as organic matter was derived from forests in previous studies natural sources such as leaves soil riparian plants and groundwater were accounted for as dom end members in the emma calculation derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2019 tak et al 2021 however the study area has a high proportion of agricultural area and a high dom pool originating from discharge facilities thus anthropogenic sources of organic matter such as those in the effluent group were more important than natural sources hur et al 2021 therefore effluent groups such as agricultural land pig livestock cow livestock industrial and swine treatment facility were added to the dom end members the emma model can only be operated when the spectroscopic indices and stable isotope δ13c doc of all dom end members are clearly differentiated without overlapping phillips et al 2003 2014 the dom end members of the present study do not overlap but certain end members of the effluent group agricultural land pig livestock and industry may experience degraded effectiveness when they are located close to other end members phillips et al 2005 agricultural effluent unlike other effluent groups had a similar spectroscopic value to that of soil fig 4a organic matter from agricultural land effluent originates from crops and soil therefore the spectroscopic indices of agricultural effluent are considered to be closer to soil than other effluent groups despite agriculture area accounting for a significant part of the miho river the high contribution rate of soil in model 1 can be considered to support the above hypothesis thus referencing a new conservative index to use three end members instead of two for application to emma could alleviate these limitations model 2 in previous studies the δ13c value showed a linear conservative relationship with varying mixing ratios of end members for particulate organic matter samples indicating its strong capacity for identifying the contribution of the source derrien et al 2019 in addition positive results for the determination of the contribution rate have been reported using isotopes instead of spectroscopic indices derrien et al 2018 recently cases of overcoming limitations using biomarkers such as geological qualities along with isotopes have been reported amelung et al 2008 cooper et al 2015 derrien et al 2019 the application of spectroscopic indices for source tracking of dom requires forethought in terms of natural processes ideally an appropriate index for distinguishing the source must be insensitive to biogeochemical processes to effectively differentiate between dissimilar dom sources without careful consideration of biogeochemical processes spectroscopic indices may falsely estimate the dom contribution rate using emma according to previous research spectroscopic indices such as suva fi hix and bix may change due to biogeochemical processes such as photodissociation biodegradation and adsorption therefore the unique characteristic value of the dom source may be damaged without being conserved and could affect the determination of the contribution rate jung et al 2014 lusk and toor 2016 begum et al 2019 additionally the probability of changes in the spectroscopic indices must be sufficiently acknowledged for different areas lakes reservoirs etc with long term residence times for biogeochemical treatment operations according to lee et al 2018 when spectroscopic indices through emma are applied without the consideration of biogeochemical impact on the determination of relative contribution rates of dom sources serious error under or overestimation may occur for instance in environments with numerous effluent groups using emma to estimate the dom source based on spectroscopic indices could lead to overestimation however bix and suva254 showed only minor changes despite exposure to biodegradation and uv irradiation such results imply that certain indices offer reliable estimated values to the dom source regardless of biogeochemical processes despite this uncertainty the application of indices that are insensitive to biogeochemical reactions to the emma model could assist in the provision of critical information for analyzing dom sources and reactivity in aquatic environments in the study area non point source pollutants belonging to the effluent group were predominant dom sources as opposed to natural sources such as soil riparian plants and algae numerous studies have utilized natural sources such as leaves soil riparian plants and groundwater as dom end members in emma considering the land use type or regional characteristics derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2019 non point source pollutants originating from agricultural areas and livestock are increasing in the study area thus non point source pollutants belonging to the effluent group are predominant compared to inputs from natural sources therefore biodegradation and biogeochemical changes occur owing to the activity of microorganisms originating from effluent treatment facilities possibly altering the spectroscopic indices value lee et al 2018 in particular specimen pre processing for stable isotope analysis does not account for problems that occur during the extraction process for analysis of spectroscopic indices derrien et al 2018 2019 thus the possibility of generating results from emma with higher reliability is greater model 2 was found to correspond more closely to the land use of the study area compared to model 1 the characteristics of each land use were distinguished using hca to examine the effects of land use and land cover on the watershed ministry of environment 2021 the results were visualized using a dendrogram and the sampling sites were divided into clusters based on the similarity of land use urban agriculture forest pasture barren and waterbodies cluster can be interpreted as a watershed area with a high inflow of artificial water pollutants due to agricultural livestock and urban areas that account for more than 60 of the area model 1 showed a higher soil contribution from forest area origin and model 2 showed a higher agricultural effluent origin therefore model 2 is more suitable compared to land use 3 4 relationship between spectroscopic indices and dual nitrate isotopes in the study area the range of seasonal values of pre monsoon δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were 3 0 27 5 and 2 4 6 3 respectively which were broader than in other periods fig 7 during the monsoon period δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values ranged between 9 9 20 7 and 2 6 7 7 respectively the minimum and maximum values decreased during the post monsoon period with ranges of 9 2 17 0 and 2 3 6 9 respectively a lighter δ15n no3 value during the monsoon period was presumed to reflect soil organic n or chemical fertilizer input liu et al 2006 li et al 2019 because the two sources are relatively lighter than the manure and sewage waste values table 1 these lighter δ15n no3 values in the monsoon period might not result from atmospheric precipitation owing to its general minor contribution to the nitrate content of streams matiatos et al 2016 vrzel et al 2016 this was due to an increased input of din leached from don particles during the monsoon period as soil erodes owing to cultivation and human activities in the study area which generate runoff into rivers liu et al 2018 the heavier δ15n no3 value was observed pre monsoon period suggesting a greater input of manure and septic waste nitrate derived from manure and wastewater are highly enriched in δ15n no3 10 20 than nitrate from most synthetic fertilizers 3 3 atmospheric deposition 15 7 or natural soils 6 9 kendall 2007 δ18o no3 is often used to explain the nitrification process which originates from nitrate and atmospheric precipitation generally nitrate originating from atmospheric precipitation has heavier values of 60 but nitrate originating from nitrification has low values from 10 to 10 kendall et al 2007 most of the δ18o no3 values were in the general range of nitrification in the miho river suggesting that nitrate was mainly derived from nitrification however nitrate sources may have overlapping isotopic values in this study which limit the applicability of nitrate isotopes alone to provide accurate estimations of nitrate sources din derived from dom is the predominant inorganic n forms are nh4 and no3 ions which are leached by waters from plants surface runoff from stormwater and streams in urban watersheds kim et al 2017 jani and toor 2018 dom and nitrate transport together in the dissolved phase in the river watershed and potential correlations have been reported mitchell et al 2006 ma et al 2016 duan et al 2022 previous studies suggest that spectroscopic indices of dom can be referenced to ascertain the origin and characteristics of nitrate and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 can be used to determine its sources therefore it may be possible to estimate the relative contributions of potential dom sources using emma based on spectroscopic indices and dual nitrate isotopes fi and bix indices represented terrestrial and allochthonous origins of dom within the miho river respectively with a high correlation with δ15n no3 a significantly positive correlation was found between bix and δ15n no3 with pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon r 2 values of 0 60 0 57 and 0 54 respectively fig 6 a significantly positive correlation was also detected between fi and δ15n no3 with pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon r2 values of 0 61 0 55 and 0 42 respectively however the negative correlation between fi bix and δ18o no3 was found to be consistent throughout the study and their linear relationship was weak fig 6 thus fi bix and δ15n no3 were used to assess the rate of contribution of n sources originating from the effluent and groundwater groups fig 8 consequently agricultural effluent 74 1 showed the highest contribution rate in the pre monsoon period followed by pig livestock 14 7 swine treatment facility 4 1 cow livestock 1 7 and industrial facility 1 5 effluents the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods were less affected by river and rainwater input indicating that the no3 emission source is mainly affected by local activities and sources in contrast strong surface runoff and heavy rainfall during the monsoon period may carry a greater amount of pollutants into the miho river and change the contribution rate of the no3 emission source therefore the concentrations of the n source and origin during the pre and post monsoon periods are significantly affected by regional activity li et al 2020 the rainfall is low during non monsoon periods and the nitrate inflow into the miho river is significantly lower and more irregular agricultural land is predominant in these areas suggesting that the water quality may be affected by intensive agricultural activities in the study area agricultural water continuously flows from upstream reservoirs into the farmland to cultivate crops many n sources originating from the farmland flow into nearby rivers which are represented by the high contribution rate of agricultural effluent moreover livestock and swine treatment facilities are located near the miho river indicating that it may be a potential don source however during the monsoon period accompanied by a storm the rate of contribution of agricultural effluent 40 3 decreased during this period pig livestock effluent 18 0 showed a high contribution rate followed by urban 16 9 and industrial facility 7 8 effluents and groundwater 6 9 this tendency during heavy rainfall is closely related to the typical inflow of non point source pollutants of various n origins through surface runoff paredes et al 2020 owing to the strong time variability of rainfall the stream and river n cycle and influx of nitrate become complex when allochthonous nitrate flows into the water system therefore there is a clear difference in the source contribution rate of nitrate between the monsoon and non monsoon periods this result suggests that the flow of local emission sources originating from upstream or the land around the river during the two periods is significant after the monsoon period the rate of contribution of agricultural effluent 61 2 increased again similar to the pre monsoon period for other sources in the following order pig livestock 16 6 cow livestock 5 9 urban 4 8 and swine treatment facility 4 3 effluents the seasonal tendency of the rate of contribution of the n source was similar to the results provided in section 3 3 therefore this similarity supports our results but there is the issue of non existent δ15n no3 values in certain end members such as soil and plants however the correlation between spectroscopic indices fi and bix and δ15n no3 was used to determine the quantitative contribution rate which could be used to determine the source of n pollutants in addition linear relationships can support emma models with spectroscopic indices and δ13c doc methods 3 5 molecular composition from lc orbitrap ms analysis the ranges of molecular compounds in the miho river were 4 181 7 303 3 032 7 780 3 000 4 000 during the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively chon compounds were the most abundant during all periods followed by cho chos and chons compounds the abundance of chon compounds provides evidence of additional dom inputs from manure and manure containing soil begum et al 2022 high ratios of chon compounds in dom in the streams during the monsoon period have been reported to originate from nearby soil or manure pang et al 2021 begum et al 2022 chon compounds were reported to be high in biodegradable dom from agricultural watersheds luek et al 2020 the active transformation of inorganic n content within dom by microorganisms could increase the inflow of nitrates and dom into the miho river lusk and toor 2016 these findings support the importance of the correlation of spectroscopic indices of dom fi and bix and nitrate in the study area pesticides and pharmaceuticals accounted for 50 or more of the total characterized dissolved organic compounds followed by food and human and industrial activities fig 9 among the pesticides analyzed bromobutide had the highest concentration which coincides with the results of the emma model which show that the agricultural effluent had the highest contribution rate among pharmaceuticals the concentration of the antibiotic amoxicillin was the highest which is widely used as a medicine in cow and pig livestock 3 6 implications for the applicability of source tracking tools for dom korea s industrial wastewater discharge regulations have replaced chemical oxygen demand cod with total organic carbon toc all industrial wastewater effluents should comply with the respective toc requirement from 2022 the switch from cod to toc is a progressive change in protecting waterbodies from organic pollutants therefore it is necessary to develop a technique to track organic pollutants and evaluate their contribution rates to manage toc loading complex urban watershed areas where various effluent groups lie sporadically create distinct scenarios for dom and nitrate inflows because the effective modulation of various effluent sources such as agriculture industrial livestock and wastewater treatment facilities is difficult the estimation of contribution rates based on spectroscopic indices fi and bix and stable isotopes δ13c doc tended to differ seasonally based on spectroscopic indices alone the most probable reason for this was the change in fluorescent characteristics of dom with biogeochemical transformations derrien et al 2017 in addition the alkali process can alter the fluorescent value of dom during pre processing derrien et al 2018 the estimated contribution rate from the present study based on spectroscopic indices fi and bix and stable isotopes δ13c doc was closer to the miho river land use characteristics compared to those estimated using only spectroscopic indices additionally the correlation between the spectroscopic indices and the δ15n no3 isotope and molecular formulas support these findings well the preparation of specimens for isotope analysis is not affected by pre processing such as alkali extraction therefore emma based on spectroscopic indices and stable isotopes is more likely to produce reliable results and is an important tool for estimating the contribution rate of various effluent sources that are scattered over complex urban watershed areas such as the miho river additionally data obtained from this method can be used as the baseline for precautionary pollutant source management systems 4 conclusions this study demonstrated dynamical transitions in the contributions of various potential sources to dom according to seasonal changes using spectroscopic indices and multi stable isotopes a combination of spectroscopic indices fi and bix and δ13c doc isotope was the strongest indicator for estimating the contribution of dom sources in a complex river watershed emma results showed that agricultural effluent 51 2 was the most dominant dom source in the pre and post monsoon periods whereas more diverse sources such as soil 30 4 and industrial 8 9 urban 9 7 and livestock effluents 8 4 were presented in the monsoon period δ15n no3 and spectroscopic indices fi and bix showed a positive correlation it was found that nitrate leached from don can be affected by intensive agricultural activity in addition chon molecular composition was clearly demonstrated that pesticides and pharmaceuticals used in agricultural land and livestock accounted for more than 50 of characterized molecular composition of dom emma results based on spectroscopic indices δ15n no3 and composition of molecular compounds were consistent with the land use types in the study area thus our study provides new insights into the applicability of spectroscopic indices and multi stable isotope for tracing the sources of dom in aquatic systems consequently this approach is expected to be useful for the estimation of the contributions of natural and anthropogenic sources that are transported from point and non point sources toward the dom pool credit authorship contribution statement min seob kim conceptualization resources data curation formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing

15147,dissolved organic matter dom in river watersheds dynamically changes based on its source during a monsoon period with storm event however the variations in dom in urban and rural river watersheds that are dominated by point and non point sources have not been adequately explored to date we developed an innovative approach to reveal dom sources in complex river watershed systems during pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon periods using end member mixing analysis emma by combining multi isotope values δ13c doc δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and spectroscopic indices fluorescence index fi biological index bix humification index hix and specific uv absorbance suva several potential end members of dom sources were collected from watersheds including top soils groundwater plant group fallen leaves riparian plants suspended algae and different effluents cattle and pig livestock agricultural land urban industry facility swine treatment facility and wastewater treatment facility concentrations of dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic nitrogen no3 n and nh4 n increased during the monsoon period with an increase in the input of anthropogenic dom which have higher hix values owing to the flushing effect the results of emma indicate that soil and agricultural effluents accounted for a substantial contribution of anthropogenic dom at varying rates based on seasons we also found that results of emma based on combining spectroscopic indices and δ13c doc isotope values were more accurate in tracing dom sources with respect to land use characteristics compared to applying only spectroscopic indices the positive relationship between fi bix and δ15n no3 were revealed that nitrate would be decomposed from dom affected by intensive agricultural activities in addition consistent with the emma results the molecular composition of the dom was clearly evidenced by a large number of chon formulas accounting for over 50 of the total characterized compounds including pesticides and pharmaceuticals used in agriculture farmland and livestock our results clearly demonstrated that emma based on combing multi stable isotopes and spectroscopic indices could be trace the dom source which is important for understanding changes in the dom quality and application of nitrate isotopes and molecular analysis supports in depth interpretation this study provides easy and intuitive techniques for the estimation of the relative impacts of dom sources in complex river watersheds which can be verified in various ways rather than relying on a single technique

and contribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a mixture of numerous organic compounds that occurs in various environmental matrices it plays a key role in determining the global carbon cycle and fate of organic matter through active transformation and biogeochemical reactivity battin et al 2009 bolan et al 2011 mcdonough et al 2020 shi et al 2020 the origin of dom in aquatic systems is generally classified into allochthonous and autochthonous allochthonous dom originates from soil vascular plants terrestrial debris and exogenous organic matter transported from land to rivers and streams during rainfall nguyen et al 2011 yang et al 2015 lee et al 2019 in contrast autochthonous dom is derived from algae phytoplankton macrophytes and heterotrophic organisms including bacteria and zooplankton as well as organic matter composed of detritus tank et al 2010 chen and jaffe 2014 the origin of dom entering the water system may vary depending on land use within the watershed e g agriculture cities forestry livestock and industrial complexes and the impact of storm events among others zheng et al 2020 begum et al 2022 for example considering the influence of land use the dom in agricultural land is mainly contributed by fertilizer livestock barns and livestock manure among others meanwhile in urban areas sewage treatment plants industrial wastewater etc mainly contribute to dom in forest areas the main sources of dom are leaves soil algae riparian vegetation and groundwater with regard to agricultural and urban watershed areas water flow during monsoon and heavy rainfall periods has a substantial impact on the changes in the origin of dom inamdar et al 2011 yang et al 2015 although the main water flow generally passes through groundwater during the baseflow period surface flow increases considerably during periods of high precipitation and water table rise resulting in potential changes in various dom sources derrien et al 2015 2018 lee et al 2019 in particular during monsoon period which is accompanied by frequent events of storms and heavy rainfall organic matter of natural origin such as soil riparian plants and leaves flows into the river system in large quantities in addition to point and non point sources for example anthropogenic sources dhillon and inamdar 2013 lloret et al 2013 it accounts for a sizeable portion of the annual dom contribution however little research has been conducted on the contribution of potential and various dom sources in complex river basin environments with numerous point and non point sources lee et al 2019 in order to identify the main origin of dom source during storms several previous studies have used various qualitative analysis data including spectral indices molecular weight and isotope ratio characteristics yang and hur 2014 derrien et al 2018 hawkes et al 2018 farre et al 2019 lee et al 2019 mohapatra et al 2021 begum et al 2022 duan et al 2022 the commonly used spectroscopic indices include the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 weishaar et al 2003 fluorescence index fi mcknight et al 2001 humidification index hix birdwell and engel 2010 and biological index bix huguet et al 2009 the fi has been used to distinguish terrestrial 1 2 1 5 and microbial 1 7 2 0 dom sources mcknight et al 2001 and the hix has been used to differentiate between allochthonous 16 and autochthonous 4 contributions birdwell and engel 2010 the bix has been used to distinguish allochthonous 0 6 0 7 and biological 1 dom sources huguet et al 2009 and the suva254 value has been used to differentiate between algal and bacterial 1 8 and terrestrial 3 sources weishaar et al 2003 these spectroscopic indices facilitate easy and rapid detection and are cost effective and enable the distinction between allochthonous and autochthonous origins of dom tak et al 2021 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and liquid chromatography orbitrap mass spectrometry lc orbitrap ms techniques play an important role in recent dom studies by facilitating identification of dom sources through the determination of molecular composition of dom mixtures farre et al 2019 mohapatra et al 2021 stable isotope analysis is the most effective means to trace the origin and transformation processes of organic matter the carbon stable isotope ratio δ13c is an excellent tool for tracking organic matter sources and transformation processes as it reflects the isotopic composition of local plants according to the photosynthetic pathway and land use choi ro and chang 2005 kang et al 2019 numerous previous studies have shown that the carbon stable isotope technique is a powerful tool to distinguish between allochthonous and autochthonous origins of dom lambert et al 2011 toming et al 2013 derrien et al 2018 2019 the conventional way to analyze the stable isotope ratio of dom analyzing the obtained powder after freeze drying of water samples for several days using elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometry ea irms ghandi et al 2004 lambert et al 2013 this method is inexpensive but takes substantial time in addition although the recovery rate is higher than the oven drying process the freeze drying process causes loss of volatile compounds and some organic compounds low oxygenated functional groups resulting in isotope fractionation moody c s 2020 recently an instrument that combines total organic carbon analyzer and stable isotope mass spectrometer tc tn irms has been developed in order to overcome such shortcomings it can directly analyze the isotope ratio of dom in water samples without any pre treatment freeze drying and requires small amounts in µl of samples federherr et al 2014 quantitative approaches such as linear mixed models have been applied recently to select potential dom end members and to estimate the relative contribution of the sources the iso source program provided by the us environmental protection agency epa has been frequently used traditionally because it is simple and easy to use however it does reflect the potential variability of the dom end members because it is applied mainly to the isotope ratio ye et al 2018 the stable isotope analysis in r siar model was suggested as an alternative dom source tracking technique with only isotope data menges et al 2020 the siar based end member mixing analysis emma model has been used recently to overcome this limitation lee et al 2019 tak et al 2021 it reflects the variability of dom by utilizing the fluorescence index values of the end members and effectively tracks the dom origin by evaluating the contribution rate of each source however biogeochemical processes can alter the chemical composition of the dom resulting in fluctuations in the spectral indices of the dom source and leading to uncertainty in emma results derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2020a in order to compensate for these shortcomings this study attempts a three dimensional mixed analysis for the first time in which the carbon stable isotope ratio and fluorescence index of dom are simultaneously applied to the emma model the stable isotope ratio has high accuracy and low variability in tracing the source in an aquatic environment and the emma model using the dom fluorescence index facilitates easy tracking of the complex dom sources it is expected that the new method created by combining these two methods would complement the existing problems although previous research has implemented a two dimensional approach using the spectral indices of the dom source end members this study applies a three dimensional approach by adding δ13c doc to reduce the errors enabling feasible and accurate source tracing of dom using the emma model dom and nutrients of various anthropogenic origins resulting from rapid urban development and human activities e g industrialization sewage discharge livestock agricultural activities construction and deforestation enter rivers he et al 2022 in particular owing to the increase in water inflow during the monsoon period it is difficult to identify their impacts on water bodies ryu et al 2018 shang et al 2020 therefore tracking the movement and transformation of dom in the water environment is essential to assess and improve water quality which would contribute to efficient and sustainable management in urban watersheds the objectives of this study were to 1 compare the dom properties of potential end member sources distributed in complex river basin systems 2 investigate dynamic changes in the chemical composition of dom during the rainy season monsoon using spectroscopic indices and stable isotope ratios 3 analyze the quantitative relationship between spectroscopic indices and multiple stable isotopes δ13c doc δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 using the emma model which has been demonstrated to be a simple and effective method to quantify the relative contributions of various sources and 4 estimate the relative contribution of potential dom sources regarding the novelty of this study no previous study has attempted to use the new emma model to quantitatively estimate the relative contribution of dom sources in complex water bodies where various anthropogenic dom sources exist e g effluent groups of agricultural land cattle and pig livestock urban and industrial facility wastewater and swine treatment facilities as well as natural dom sources during monsoon period including storm event this study is the first trial comprising a three dimensional emma model using δ13c doc stable isotopes and spectral indicators furthermore this study demonstrates the possible application of nitrate isotopes and lc orbitrap analyses results with regard to the identification of dom sources in complex water bodies for in depth interpretation of the three dimensional emma results 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the miho river watershed is located in the central east region of the geum river one of the four major rivers in south korea and belongs to its first

this complex river watershed system effluents from domestic sewage livestock agricultural activities and industries flow into the miho river watershed system and their quantities increased from 2015 to 2020 during this period the urban population number of cows and pigs and number of industries increased by 24 7 48 7 and 39 7 respectively ministry of environment 2020 the flow rate of sewage and pollutant loadings also increased during this period the average percentage of non point pollution was 91 9 which included a high 50 proportion of effluents indicating the importance of management of these sources the miho river watershed comprises of 12 public sewage treatment facilities 13 industrial wastewater treatment facilities 5 excreta treatment facilities 2 livestock excreta treatment facilities and 42 small scale sewage treatment facilities fig 1 the monsoon period in east asia usually accounts for 50 60 of the total annual precipitation park et al 2010 in the study area from 2015 to 2021 the rainfall in the monsoon period contributed to 57 4 of the annual rainfall with a mean of 708 0 mm in august www kma go kr 2 2 sample collection surface water samples were collected from may to september 2021 at 13 sites of the miho river five sites were in the main river m1 m5 and eight sites were in tributaries t1 t8 samples were collected in the pre monsoon may july monsoon august and post monsoon september october periods during the monsoon period rainfall events were concentrated with multiple storms the water samples were collected using a van dorn water sampler and filtered using a pre combusted 450 c for 6 h 0 45 µm gf 5 filter whatman maidstone uk to collect dom after filtration the filtrates were sampled in 40 ml amber vials and stored at 20 c prior to analysis all potential dom source materials were collected before the monsoon period to avoid disturbance various types of sources such as fallen leaves n 5 topsoil 0 1 cm n 3 suspended algae n 2 groundwater n 2 and riparian plants n 5 were collected in the upper reaches of the miho river effluents from pig n 3 and cow n 4 livestock agricultural areas n 3 industrial facilities n 8 urban areas n 2 swine treatment facilities n 2 and wastewater treatment facilities n 2 were collected as potential sources in previous studies effluents from wastewater treatment plants and groundwater were selected as the sources of dom yang et al 2015 lee et al 2019 however in our study area the land use types include agricultural industrial and livestock areas and thus various sources of effluents exist therefore we added effluents as a potential source group of dom topsoil samples were collected in triplicate from the surface to a depth of 1 cm using a hand held shovel after the sample was freeze dried it was thawed and the solid substances were removed using a 500 µm nylon sieve suspended algae were collected using a plankton net and freeze dried riparian plants were collected and washed softly using deionized water to free the substances after the samples were freeze dried for few weeks they were ground using a mortar and pestle dom extraction of organic materials was performed in duplicate by combining samples using milli q water in ratios of 1 10 for soil and 1 20 for other materials followed by sonification for 24 h at 150 rpm all samples were centrifuged and supernatants were filtered

in r siar based on bayesian mixing model version 3 1 10 stock et al 2018 siar mixing models have been successfully applied for food source partitioning in consumers or the tracking of pollution source using various stable isotope ratios choi et al 2021 kim et al 2021 ryu et al 2021 although r program has been used mainly in the analysis of stable isotope ratios recently it has been used to estimate the contribution of dom using spectroscopic indices lee et al 2020b tak et al 2021 begum et al 2022 in the present study we attempted to create a novel siar model with spectroscopic indices and stable isotopes because δ13c doc unlike δ13c particulate organic carbon poc is closely related to dom to apply the end member mixing model the appropriate spectroscopic indices were selected by following the criteria established in literature derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2019 begum et al 2022 first spectroscopic indices were subtracted if the samples were beyond the range of the end member next indices with high capacities to distinguish between various dom sources were selected based on these criteria bix and fi were chosen for the end member mixing model 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality during monsoon period 3 1 1 precipitation and c and n levels during the monsoon period storm events occurred and the total amount of precipitation was 347 mm in particular a high amount of precipitation of 101 mm was recorded during storm event in the post and pre monsoon periods rainfall was much less at 202 and 111 mm respectively fig 2 a the changes in doc don tdn no3 n and nh4 n levels were significantly different among the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods p 0 05 the maximum doc level was observed during the monsoon period 77 2 mg l and was relatively low in the pre and post monsoon periods at 60 0 and 44 8 mg l respectively fig 2b this indicates that terrestrial and allochthonous dom flows into rivers from the organic rich layer as a result of the hydrological flushing of potential doc pools a tendency toward increased doc levels in streams and rivers owing to the influence of a storm event during the monsoon period has also been observed in previous studies inamdar et al 2011 dhillon and inamdar 2013 yang et al 2015 lee et al 2021b the average don tdn no3 n and nh4 n levels in the study area were the highest in the monsoon period at 0 8 7 7 5 9 and 1 0 mg l respectively and were relatively low in the pre and post monsoon periods at 0 7 3 4 2 5 and 0 1 mg l 0 3 3 1 2 5 and 0 2 mg l respectively fig 2b because n sources such as fertilizers and manures that originate from agricultural and livestock related activities which are concentrated around the miho river have a greater effect during the monsoon period ryu et al 2018 2021 increases in both doc and tdn levels during the monsoon period suggest that large amounts of terrestrial and allochthonous dom may flow into the miho river with fractions of organic and inorganic matter due to landscape disturbances 3 1 2 spectroscopic properties of dom spectroscopic indices represent the structural or chemical characteristics of dom pools such as humification allochthonous or autochthonous contribution algal or bacterial source and aromaticity in the present study the suva254 value decreased by 0 25 times in the monsoon period mean 1 56 compared to that in the pre 2 04 and post monsoon 2 00 periods suggesting a decrease in the dom aromaticity fig 3 a suva254 values increased during the monsoon period or a storm event owing to the input of aromatic structures and humified dom yang et al 2015 lee et al 2019 2020a derrien et al 2020 however our results showed contrasting trends suggesting that dom originated from fresh leaf litter or increased with the export of aromatic compounds fellman et al 2009 austnes et al 2010 yang et al 2015 much higher changes in hix values 5 15 7 59 were observed fig 3b and they increased during the monsoon period 7 59 compared to those in the pre 6 81 and post monsoon 5 15 periods which may have increased allochthonous sources owing to the flushing effect during the monsoon period bix 0 70 0 79 and fi 1 45 1 56 values showed slight increases during the monsoon period but no clear trends were observed fig 3c and d hix and bix values represent a humid feature hix 5 and a small autochthonous contribution bix 0 7 huguet et al 2009 the fi value was close to that of the terrestrial fulvic acid 1 4 and it was completely different from that of microbial fulvic acid 1 9 mcknight et al 2001 therefore the riverine dom during the monsoon period is estimated to be enriched with fresh leaf litter and have a low quantity of humified dom composition with significant fluctuations during rainfall events possibly from terrestrial or allochthonous sources a simple comparison of the spectroscopic indices between dom and various end member sources is limited in its ability to perform a qualitative evaluation of dom sources in the monsoon period owing to dynamic changes in the relative contributions of different sources however the end member mixing analyses emma model can differentiate between the contributions of different dom sources based on multiple quality indices such as spectroscopic indices and multi stable isotopes 3 2 characteristics of end member dom based on previous studies derrien et al 2020 lee et al 2020a suva254 hix bi and fi were selected as possible spectroscopic indices to trace the dom source however δ13c doc values were investigated for the first time only a few studies have compared the fluorescence characteristics of dom of end members and δ13c poc within a river watershed however to date there is no comparison of δ13c doc values 3 2 1 c and n levels and isotope values the 12 end members were divided into four groups which comprised plants soil water and effluent according to their characteristics as a respective dom source table 1 in the plant group the doc and don levels in riparian plants 33 22 and 2 28 mg g were obviously higher than those in leaves 10 21 and 0 82 mg g and algae 5 1 and 0 39 mg g the δ13c doc isotope values of riparian plants leaf and algal end members showed slight differences variations in δ13c doc are caused by the different c assimilation procedures used by microbes and plants in the river and their sources such as allochthonous and autochthonous these isotopic signatures are passed to the doc lee et al 2021b 2020c godfrey 2021 the plants group is within a similar range to that of c3 plants in previous studies with values ranging from 33 to 24 for c3 plants and 16 to 10 for c4 plants yoon et al 2016 derrien et al 2018 the soil 0 51 and 0 06 mg g and water groundwater 0 32 and 0 02 mg g groups showed the lowest doc and don concentrations among the end member groups similar c isotope values 25 3 have been reported in the soil organic matter of areas dominated by c3 plants lebreton et al 2016 lee et al 2017 in particular δ13c isotope values similar to those in our study 24 5 have been reported in the dominant reed species lambert et al 2011 in the present study organic matter derived from terrestrial plants riparian plants and soil leached organic matter that show a refractory nature and lighter δ13c values could contribute to the dom in the miho river region the δ13c doc isotope value in the groundwater end member group is relatively higher than that in the plant soil and water end member groups but showed a similar tendency to the effluent group indicating that the groundwater may have been affected by effluents the effluent groups representing various doc and don concentrations were observed in the following order swine treatment facility effluent 40 31 and 11 46 mg g cow livestock effluent 15 24 and 4 56 mg g pig livestock effluent 10 71 and 1 77 mg g wastewater treatment effluent 7 82 and 0 92 mg g industrial facility effluent 5 55 and 0 41 mg g urban effluent 3 61 and 0 28 mg g agricultural land effluent 3 52 and 0 26 mg g additionally the δ13c doc values showed in the range of 25 1 to 20 4 the differences in the δ13c doc values among effluent groups p 0 05 were attributed to their diverse origins previous studies were limited to inferring the origin of dom by analyzing δ13c poc because the δ13c of effluent dom could not be directly measured derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2021a in the present study the δ13c of dom was directly measured to determine the characteristics of each effluent type effluents from pig and cow livestock urban areas and swine treatment facilities showed relatively heavier δ15n no3 values compared to those of agricultural and wastewater treatment plants the swine treatment facility effluent showed the highest doc and don levels and it was distinguished from other end members by much heavier δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values p 0 05 previous studies have reported that sewage sewage treatment effluent swine effluent and manure inputs led to increased δ15n no3 values n contamination from swine effluent in river tributaries and mainstreams were accurately identified ryu et al 2021 our δ15n no3 value of agricultural effluent 5 8 was consistent with those of previous studies which reported that utilizing inorganic fertilizer on agricultural fields led to lighter δ15n no3 values 3 6 in the receiving waters hood et al 2014 the δ15n no3 values in effluents of wastewater treatment facility of our results are similar to those of other studies lee et al 2016 ryu et al 2021 3 2 2 spectroscopic indices within effluent groups the wastewater treatment effluent exhibited the highest bix 1 21 but lowest hix 0 95 values indicating that this end member includes large amounts of microbial sources that originated from biological treatment processes table 1 parlanti et al 2000 henderson et al 2009 the relatively higher hix 8 05 9 28 and fi 1 49 1 68 values in effluents of industrial facility urban and agricultural land suggest the intense humification of dom as opposed to algae and wastewater treatment effluents which may contain aromatic compounds mcknight et al 2001 the common fluorescence properties of the effluents of pig and cow livestock and swine treatment facility showed relatively low hix 5 71 6 84 and fi 1 65 1 82 values which indicate a significant presence of fresh biological organic matter within the plants group leaves displayed relatively low bix 0 51 and fi 1 28 values indicating a high content of humified dom chen et al 2014 in contrast riparian plants exhibited the presence of a labile fraction and low contents of humified dom and aromatics leenheer et al 2003 and relatively low hix 0 71 and suva254 0 87 values the highest fi values 2 01 were observed in algae which is in accordance with previously reported studies lee et al 2019 the lower values of bix 0 67 and fi 1 34 in soil indicates terrestrial origin with low content of biologically fresh dom groundwater dom showed relatively low suva254 0 70 and hix 3 85 values and high bix 0 87 and fi 1 88 values lee et al 2019 reported groundwater suva254 0 43 bix 0 8 and fi 2 02 values similar to those of our study yang et al 2015 showed groundwater suva254 0 97 hix 6 12 bix 0 89 and fi 1 74 values different from our research probably because of differences in regional properties plant derived or effluent derived dom our findings show that there are relatively higher levels of humification in dom of effluents of industrial facility urban and agricultural land and leaves soil and riparian plants fresh biological products dominated in the dom of effluents of pig and cow livestock and swine treatment facility 3 3 comparison between end member mixing analyses based only on spectroscopic indices and a combination of spectroscopic indices and δ13c doc emma models were applied to the fi bix and δ13c doc on 12 dom end members that individually correspond to study periods the plot of fi against bix differentiates various end members and positions samples within the range of spectroscopic indices of the end members fig 4 a specifically the fi values of all the samples 1 29 1 79 were higher than those of leaves 1 28 but lower than those of effluent of swine treatment facility 1 82 groundwater 1 88 and algae 2 01 the bix values of all the samples 0 62 0 87 were higher than those of leaves 0 51 but were less than those of the wastewater treatment facility 1 21 in addition the δ13c doc values of all monsoon samples 27 0 to 21 9 were heavier than leaf 29 7 and riparian plants 27 7 but were lighter than industrial 17 8 and swine 20 4 effluents fig 4b model 1 of emma used applied spectroscopic indices fi and bix and model 2 applied spectroscopic indices fi and bix and stable isotope δ13c doc values to track the source of dom results determined from the two models were compared to select the suitable model we hypothesized that the estimated source distribution from the miho river will be in accordance with or not significantly different from the characteristics of land use results showed that the rate of contribution during the pre monsoon period in model 1 was the highest in soil 47 9 and agricultural effluent 24 5 followed by leaves 13 4 groundwater 3 1 pig livestock effluent 1 7 and industrial effluent 1 6 fig 5 the rate of contribution differed remarkably in model 2 in the following order agricultural effluent 51 soil 33 7 industrial effluent 3 0 pig livestock effluent 2 1 and leaves 2 0 fig 5 in both models the dom of allochthonous origin affected the study area to a greater extent compared to that of autochthonous origin while soil and agricultural effluent groups were considered major sources of dom aggregate 70 the contribution rate of soil was higher in model 1 and that of agricultural effluent in model 2 the result of model 1 contrast with the high proporation 35 of auricultural area and the increasing trend of effluent groups such as livestock public wastewaer and industrial wastewater treatment facilities in the study area ministry of environment 2021 contrasting results to the pre monsoon period were generated from model 1 for the monsoon period accompanied by stormwater input fig 5 the contribution rates from the highest to lowest were as follows agricultural effluent 33 1 soil 20 3 groundwater 7 4 urban effluent 6 9 and industrial effluent 5 9 also the order of contribution rates determined by model 2 were very different between pre monsoon and monsoon periods fig 5 soil 30 4 showed the highest contribution rate followed by agricultural 17 8 industrial 8 9 urban 9 7 cow livestock 6 0 and pig livestock 6 0 effluents in both models effluents of agricultural and soil origin decreased respectively and the contribution rates of various dom sources tended to increase compared to those during the pre monsoon period the study site was located in a basin which is occupied by a greater distribution of permeable areas than urban landscapes therefore the runoff from organic matter within the topsoil during the monsoon period was considered to have an immediate influence on the study area the inflow of anthropogenic organic matter into the miho river was believed to occur during the monsoon period and this tendency was documented in previous studies yang et al 2015 lee et al 2019 derrien et al 2020 after the monsoon period the contribution rates in model 1 were as follows soil 32 0 agricultural effluent 17 1 leaf 17 5 groundwater 7 9 and riparian plants 0 44 fig 5 in model 2 for the post monsoon period the order was agricultural effluent 42 5 soil 24 5 industrial effluent 6 2 pig livestock effluent 4 4 and swine treatment facility effluent 4 4 fig 5 the proportion of soil and agricultural effluent is higher in both models but the natural source group leaves groundwater and riparian plants and effluent group were the leading sources of allochthonous organic matter in models 1 and 2 respectively this tendency is closely related to anthropogenic organic matter via surface runoff in complex river watershed areas or non point source pollutants of various origins of dom after the monsoon period with storm events inamdar et al 2011 yang et al 2015 lee et al 2019 as shown in fig 5 the estimated contributions of dom in the miho river based on the spectroscopic indices differ strongly from those based on spectroscopic indices and stable isotope ratio δ13c doc despite agriculture area accounting for the highest of land use characteristics 35 the greatest source of contribution was soil instead of agricultural effluent in model 1 probably because of the use of various end members in contrast to previous studies as organic matter was derived from forests in previous studies natural sources such as leaves soil riparian plants and groundwater were accounted for as dom end members in the emma calculation derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2019 tak et al 2021 however the study area has a high proportion of agricultural area and a high dom pool originating from discharge facilities thus anthropogenic sources of organic matter such as those in the effluent group were more important than natural sources hur et al 2021 therefore effluent groups such as agricultural land pig livestock cow livestock industrial and swine treatment facility were added to the dom end members the emma model can only be operated when the spectroscopic indices and stable isotope δ13c doc of all dom end members are clearly differentiated without overlapping phillips et al 2003 2014 the dom end members of the present study do not overlap but certain end members of the effluent group agricultural land pig livestock and industry may experience degraded effectiveness when they are located close to other end members phillips et al 2005 agricultural effluent unlike other effluent groups had a similar spectroscopic value to that of soil fig 4a organic matter from agricultural land effluent originates from crops and soil therefore the spectroscopic indices of agricultural effluent are considered to be closer to soil than other effluent groups despite agriculture area accounting for a significant part of the miho river the high contribution rate of soil in model 1 can be considered to support the above hypothesis thus referencing a new conservative index to use three end members instead of two for application to emma could alleviate these limitations model 2 in previous studies the δ13c value showed a linear conservative relationship with varying mixing ratios of end members for particulate organic matter samples indicating its strong capacity for identifying the contribution of the source derrien et al 2019 in addition positive results for the determination of the contribution rate have been reported using isotopes instead of spectroscopic indices derrien et al 2018 recently cases of overcoming limitations using biomarkers such as geological qualities along with isotopes have been reported amelung et al 2008 cooper et al 2015 derrien et al 2019 the application of spectroscopic indices for source tracking of dom requires forethought in terms of natural processes ideally an appropriate index for distinguishing the source must be insensitive to biogeochemical processes to effectively differentiate between dissimilar dom sources without careful consideration of biogeochemical processes spectroscopic indices may falsely estimate the dom contribution rate using emma according to previous research spectroscopic indices such as suva fi hix and bix may change due to biogeochemical processes such as photodissociation biodegradation and adsorption therefore the unique characteristic value of the dom source may be damaged without being conserved and could affect the determination of the contribution rate jung et al 2014 lusk and toor 2016 begum et al 2019 additionally the probability of changes in the spectroscopic indices must be sufficiently acknowledged for different areas lakes reservoirs etc with long term residence times for biogeochemical treatment operations according to lee et al 2018 when spectroscopic indices through emma are applied without the consideration of biogeochemical impact on the determination of relative contribution rates of dom sources serious error under or overestimation may occur for instance in environments with numerous effluent groups using emma to estimate the dom source based on spectroscopic indices could lead to overestimation however bix and suva254 showed only minor changes despite exposure to biodegradation and uv irradiation such results imply that certain indices offer reliable estimated values to the dom source regardless of biogeochemical processes despite this uncertainty the application of indices that are insensitive to biogeochemical reactions to the emma model could assist in the provision of critical information for analyzing dom sources and reactivity in aquatic environments in the study area non point source pollutants belonging to the effluent group were predominant dom sources as opposed to natural sources such as soil riparian plants and algae numerous studies have utilized natural sources such as leaves soil riparian plants and groundwater as dom end members in emma considering the land use type or regional characteristics derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2019 non point source pollutants originating from agricultural areas and livestock are increasing in the study area thus non point source pollutants belonging to the effluent group are predominant compared to inputs from natural sources therefore biodegradation and biogeochemical changes occur owing to the activity of microorganisms originating from effluent treatment facilities possibly altering the spectroscopic indices value lee et al 2018 in particular specimen pre processing for stable isotope analysis does not account for problems that occur during the extraction process for analysis of spectroscopic indices derrien et al 2018 2019 thus the possibility of generating results from emma with higher reliability is greater model 2 was found to correspond more closely to the land use of the study area compared to model 1 the characteristics of each land use were distinguished using hca to examine the effects of land use and land cover on the watershed ministry of environment 2021 the results were visualized using a dendrogram and the sampling sites were divided into clusters based on the similarity of land use urban agriculture forest pasture barren and waterbodies cluster can be interpreted as a watershed area with a high inflow of artificial water pollutants due to agricultural livestock and urban areas that account for more than 60 of the area model 1 showed a higher soil contribution from forest area origin and model 2 showed a higher agricultural effluent origin therefore model 2 is more suitable compared to land use 3 4 relationship between spectroscopic indices and dual nitrate isotopes in the study area the range of seasonal values of pre monsoon δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were 3 0 27 5 and 2 4 6 3 respectively which were broader than in other periods fig 7 during the monsoon period δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values ranged between 9 9 20 7 and 2 6 7 7 respectively the minimum and maximum values decreased during the post monsoon period with ranges of 9 2 17 0 and 2 3 6 9 respectively a lighter δ15n no3 value during the monsoon period was presumed to reflect soil organic n or chemical fertilizer input liu et al 2006 li et al 2019 because the two sources are relatively lighter than the manure and sewage waste values table 1 these lighter δ15n no3 values in the monsoon period might not result from atmospheric precipitation owing to its general minor contribution to the nitrate content of streams matiatos et al 2016 vrzel et al 2016 this was due to an increased input of din leached from don particles during the monsoon period as soil erodes owing to cultivation and human activities in the study area which generate runoff into rivers liu et al 2018 the heavier δ15n no3 value was observed pre monsoon period suggesting a greater input of manure and septic waste nitrate derived from manure and wastewater are highly enriched in δ15n no3 10 20 than nitrate from most synthetic fertilizers 3 3 atmospheric deposition 15 7 or natural soils 6 9 kendall 2007 δ18o no3 is often used to explain the nitrification process which originates from nitrate and atmospheric precipitation generally nitrate originating from atmospheric precipitation has heavier values of 60 but nitrate originating from nitrification has low values from 10 to 10 kendall et al 2007 most of the δ18o no3 values were in the general range of nitrification in the miho river suggesting that nitrate was mainly derived from nitrification however nitrate sources may have overlapping isotopic values in this study which limit the applicability of nitrate isotopes alone to provide accurate estimations of nitrate sources din derived from dom is the predominant inorganic n forms are nh4 and no3 ions which are leached by waters from plants surface runoff from stormwater and streams in urban watersheds kim et al 2017 jani and toor 2018 dom and nitrate transport together in the dissolved phase in the river watershed and potential correlations have been reported mitchell et al 2006 ma et al 2016 duan et al 2022 previous studies suggest that spectroscopic indices of dom can be referenced to ascertain the origin and characteristics of nitrate and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 can be used to determine its sources therefore it may be possible to estimate the relative contributions of potential dom sources using emma based on spectroscopic indices and dual nitrate isotopes fi and bix indices represented terrestrial and allochthonous origins of dom within the miho river respectively with a high correlation with δ15n no3 a significantly positive correlation was found between bix and δ15n no3 with pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon r 2 values of 0 60 0 57 and 0 54 respectively fig 6 a significantly positive correlation was also detected between fi and δ15n no3 with pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon r2 values of 0 61 0 55 and 0 42 respectively however the negative correlation between fi bix and δ18o no3 was found to be consistent throughout the study and their linear relationship was weak fig 6 thus fi bix and δ15n no3 were used to assess the rate of contribution of n sources originating from the effluent and groundwater groups fig 8 consequently agricultural effluent 74 1 showed the highest contribution rate in the pre monsoon period followed by pig livestock 14 7 swine treatment facility 4 1 cow livestock 1 7 and industrial facility 1 5 effluents the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods were less affected by river and rainwater input indicating that the no3 emission source is mainly affected by local activities and sources in contrast strong surface runoff and heavy rainfall during the monsoon period may carry a greater amount of pollutants into the miho river and change the contribution rate of the no3 emission source therefore the concentrations of the n source and origin during the pre and post monsoon periods are significantly affected by regional activity li et al 2020 the rainfall is low during non monsoon periods and the nitrate inflow into the miho river is significantly lower and more irregular agricultural land is predominant in these areas suggesting that the water quality may be affected by intensive agricultural activities in the study area agricultural water continuously flows from upstream reservoirs into the farmland to cultivate crops many n sources originating from the farmland flow into nearby rivers which are represented by the high contribution rate of agricultural effluent moreover livestock and swine treatment facilities are located near the miho river indicating that it may be a potential don source however during the monsoon period accompanied by a storm the rate of contribution of agricultural effluent 40 3 decreased during this period pig livestock effluent 18 0 showed a high contribution rate followed by urban 16 9 and industrial facility 7 8 effluents and groundwater 6 9 this tendency during heavy rainfall is closely related to the typical inflow of non point source pollutants of various n origins through surface runoff paredes et al 2020 owing to the strong time variability of rainfall the stream and river n cycle and influx of nitrate become complex when allochthonous nitrate flows into the water system therefore there is a clear difference in the source contribution rate of nitrate between the monsoon and non monsoon periods this result suggests that the flow of local emission sources originating from upstream or the land around the river during the two periods is significant after the monsoon period the rate of contribution of agricultural effluent 61 2 increased again similar to the pre monsoon period for other sources in the following order pig livestock 16 6 cow livestock 5 9 urban 4 8 and swine treatment facility 4 3 effluents the seasonal tendency of the rate of contribution of the n source was similar to the results provided in section 3 3 therefore this similarity supports our results but there is the issue of non existent δ15n no3 values in certain end members such as soil and plants however the correlation between spectroscopic indices fi and bix and δ15n no3 was used to determine the quantitative contribution rate which could be used to determine the source of n pollutants in addition linear relationships can support emma models with spectroscopic indices and δ13c doc methods 3 5 molecular composition from lc orbitrap ms analysis the ranges of molecular compounds in the miho river were 4 181 7 303 3 032 7 780 3 000 4 000 during the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively chon compounds were the most abundant during all periods followed by cho chos and chons compounds the abundance of chon compounds provides evidence of additional dom inputs from manure and manure containing soil begum et al 2022 high ratios of chon compounds in dom in the streams during the monsoon period have been reported to originate from nearby soil or manure pang et al 2021 begum et al 2022 chon compounds were reported to be high in biodegradable dom from agricultural watersheds luek et al 2020 the active transformation of inorganic n content within dom by microorganisms could increase the inflow of nitrates and dom into the miho river lusk and toor 2016 these findings support the importance of the correlation of spectroscopic indices of dom fi and bix and nitrate in the study area pesticides and pharmaceuticals accounted for 50 or more of the total characterized dissolved organic compounds followed by food and human and industrial activities fig 9 among the pesticides analyzed bromobutide had the highest concentration which coincides with the results of the emma model which show that the agricultural effluent had the highest contribution rate among pharmaceuticals the concentration of the antibiotic amoxicillin was the highest which is widely used as a medicine in cow and pig livestock 3 6 implications for the applicability of source tracking tools for dom korea s industrial wastewater discharge regulations have replaced chemical oxygen demand cod with total organic carbon toc all industrial wastewater effluents should comply with the respective toc requirement from 2022 the switch from cod to toc is a progressive change in protecting waterbodies from organic pollutants therefore it is necessary to develop a technique to track organic pollutants and evaluate their contribution rates to manage toc loading complex urban watershed areas where various effluent groups lie sporadically create distinct scenarios for dom and nitrate inflows because the effective modulation of various effluent sources such as agriculture industrial livestock and wastewater treatment facilities is difficult the estimation of contribution rates based on spectroscopic indices fi and bix and stable isotopes δ13c doc tended to differ seasonally based on spectroscopic indices alone the most probable reason for this was the change in fluorescent characteristics of dom with biogeochemical transformations derrien et al 2017 in addition the alkali process can alter the fluorescent value of dom during pre processing derrien et al 2018 the estimated contribution rate from the present study based on spectroscopic indices fi and bix and stable isotopes δ13c doc was closer to the miho river land use characteristics compared to those estimated using only spectroscopic indices additionally the correlation between the spectroscopic indices and the δ15n no3 isotope and molecular formulas support these findings well the preparation of specimens for isotope analysis is not affected by pre processing such as alkali extraction therefore emma based on spectroscopic indices and stable isotopes is more likely to produce reliable results and is an important tool for estimating the contribution rate of various effluent sources that are scattered over complex urban watershed areas such as the miho river additionally data obtained from this method can be used as the baseline for precautionary pollutant source management systems 4 conclusions this study demonstrated dynamical transitions in the contributions of various potential sources to dom according to seasonal changes using spectroscopic indices and multi stable isotopes a combination of spectroscopic indices fi and bix and δ13c doc isotope was the strongest indicator for estimating the contribution of dom sources in a complex river watershed emma results showed that agricultural effluent 51 2 was the most dominant dom source in the pre and post monsoon periods whereas more diverse sources such as soil 30 4 and industrial 8 9 urban 9 7 and livestock effluents 8 4 were presented in the monsoon period δ15n no3 and spectroscopic indices fi and bix showed a positive correlation it was found that nitrate leached from don can be affected by intensive agricultural activity in addition chon molecular composition was clearly demonstrated that pesticides and pharmaceuticals used in agricultural land and livestock accounted for more than 50 of characterized molecular composition of dom emma results based on spectroscopic indices δ15n no3 and composition of molecular compounds were consistent with the land use types in the study area thus our study provides new insights into the applicability of spectroscopic indices and multi stable isotope for tracing the sources of dom in aquatic systems consequently this approach is expected to be useful for the estimation of the contributions of natural and anthropogenic sources that are transported from point and non point sources toward the dom pool credit authorship contribution statement min seob kim conceptualization resources data curation formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing

15148,flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is a new technology for ion removal that delivers sustainable deionization performance however fcdi consumes relatively high amounts of energy compared with other conventional desalination technologies which hinders the industrial application of fcdi in this study the energy consumption of each fcdi component was simulated using a steady state fcdi model to investigate and optimize the main components of energy consumption overall the established process model can be used for theoretical investigation and enhancing our fundamental understanding of the energy consumption of each fcdi component and provides the design and optimization of fcdi systems the results showed that the energy consumption of the flow electrodes dominated under most conditions changing the operating parameters could obviously affect energy consumption and the energy consumption structure however increasing the flow rate and activated carbon ac content of the flow electrode could decrease the energy consumption of the electrode and the energy consumed by the ion exchange membranes iems and desalination chamber was the greatest these two parts of energy consumption could not be significantly reduced by changing operational parameters thus to further reduce the energy consumption optimization of the fcdi equipment was carried out by adding titanium mesh to the flow electrodes and the desalination chamber of the fcdi cell the results showed that the energy consumption of optimized fcdi decreased by 51 9 compared with the original fcdi the long term experiment using optimized fcdi showed good stability and repeatability keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization process model energy consumption energy consumption structure titanium mesh long term stability data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in recent years capacitive deionization cdi has emerged as a promising technology for the facile removal of charged ionic species from aqueous solutions mainly used in brackish water desalination ion removal in wastewater and resource recovery of nutrients such as n and p lin et al 2020 during the cdi process ions transported from the desalination chamber to the electrode are stored in an electric double layer on a porous carbon electrode by applying an electric field xing et al 2020 however for conventional cdi the ion removal capacity is restricted due to the static features of the electrode when the electrode is saturated with ions it needs to be regenerated via a short circuit or reversely connected which leads to intermittent operation and relatively low flow efficiency wei et al 2020 flow electrode cdi fcdi which uses a flowable carbon suspension electrode offers great advantages over conventional cdi due to its facile electrode preparation large adsorption ability continuous ion removal and high water recovery rate lim et al 2020 tang et al 2020 it is progressing toward various applications in multiple industrial areas however there are still great challenges to be applied in real cases especially as fcdi consumes relatively high amounts of energy compared with other conventional desalination technologies i e reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed hatzell et al 2015 mitko et al 2021 qin et al 2019 many researches have been done to examine what factors affect and how to decrease energy consumption fcdi consumed studies have shown that the conductivity of the flow electrode is usually around 0 1 1 ms cm because the majority of the carbon particles do not contribute to the charge transfer in the electrode which results in high energy consumption during fcdi operation doornbusch et al 2016 porada et al 2014 it was reported that a higher ac content in the flow electrode can increase conductivity and result in lower energy consumption wei et al 2020 with increasing ac content of the electrode a multitude of charge percolation networks could be developed which dramatically increased the number of charged particles and the conductivity of the electrode lohaus et al 2019 given the fact that too high an ac content showing high viscosity characteristic is prone to clogging the carbon content of the electrode of fcdi generally lies within a range of 5 20 wt dahiya and mishra 2020 porada et al 2014 several studies optimized the rheological properties of electrodes to increase the carbon content hatzell et al 2015 increased the ac content to 28 by enriching the surface of the activated carbon with oxygen heteroatoms as the modified 28 ac displayed similar viscosities to the unmodified 20 ac it is also possible to improve carbon loading by changing the flow channel structure doornbusch et al 2016 increased the ac content in the flow electrode to 35 through an innovative fluidized bed process pan et al 2021 prepared new functionalized current collector possessed higher charge efficiency ce of 81 24 and lower normalized energy consumption of 237 54 j mmol several researchers aimed to accelerate the charge transfer and facilitate ion adsorption from the aspect of slurry electrode characteristic optimization chen et al 2022 liang et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2019 liang et al 2017 added 1 cb to a 20 carbon content flow electrode effectively increasing the desalination rate and reducing energy consumption wei et al 2020 added a ferri ferrocyanide redox couple to the electrode the energy consumption was reduced from 410 26 kj mol to 102 28 kj mol at a current density of 2 38 ma cm2 luo et al 2022 prepared zif 8 derived nanocarbon materials and obtained superior performance some other studies increased electrode conductivity by optimizing the charge transfer pathway yang et al 2019 inserted a titanium mesh current collector between the ion exchange membrane iem and the perspex sheet which caused the salt removal rate to increase by about 76 zhang et al 2022 innovatively utilized the three dimensional 3d carbon coated nickel foam as current collector which strengthen the charge transfer ability of fcdi device achieving distinguished desalination efficiency for real seawater however most studies were limited to focusing on how the electrode resistance and overall desalination performance changed therefore in depth analysis of the fundamentals of the changes in fcdi energy consumption is necessary some energy consumption research methods and characterization tools were tried to explore fundamentals of the fcdi energy consumption changes firstly electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis is used to reveal the internal resistance change of the electrode some studies use the eis method to discuss the resistance change and distribution choo et al 2017 halfon and suss 2019 but eis cannot be used to systematically discuss the resistance distribution of the whole cell to further quantify the potential drop and resistance distribution across the system luo et al 2021 presented an in situ potential measurement method ispm to fractionate the energy cost contribution of each fcdi component during desalination however the potential drop of each component of the fcdi module has spatial variation so the result depends on the measurement position wang et al 2020 in the single pass mode of fcdi parameters such as the cell voltage and desalination rate are considered to be in a steady state thus all time dependencies vanish dykstra et al 2017 the energy consumption contribution of each component of the fcdi module in a steady state can be calculated by estimating the potential drop of each component therefore some studies have carried out related research using models wang et al 2020 carried out a theoretical study of the potential drop of fcdi components through the equivalent thin film electrode efe model and calculated the potential distribution of each component of the fcdi module at different relative positions but charge percolation via particle collision is ignored in the model rommerskirchen et al 2018b assumed equal distribution of potential over the whole cell and established a process model to describe the cell geometries and processes by constructing the potential balance however the model is also limited to the analysis of the overall performance of the device and the mechanisms of the operation parameters affecting the energy consumption of each component have not been discussed in details at present a new model analysis method is needed to quantify the distribution of voltage and energy consumption in each part of the fcdi system to discuss mechanisms of energy consumption changing under different operation parameters so as to optimize high energy consumption parts in this study an electrochemical model was developed to characterize the energy consumption of the steady state fcdi process in addition the energy consumption distribution of each component of fcdi under different operating conditions such as different current densities desalination chamber flow rates flow electrode flow rates and ac contents was simulated and fcdi optimization suggestions were put forward according to model results according to the energy consumption characteristics the fcdi module was optimized a titanium mesh was added between the graphite plate and the iems and or the desalination chamber to reduce the resistance and improve the charge transfer rate furthermore a 12 h long term continuous operation was also performed to evaluate the operation stability of the optimized system 2 materials and methods

distribution of the potential drops of each component of the fcdi module was quantitatively modeled using a one dimensional steady state process model valid for single pass mode experiments that was developed based on the approach used by rommerskirchen et al 2020 and wang et al 2020 assuming that ions transported into the flow electrodes are stored in the electric double layer on the surface of the activated carbon micropores in the electrode solution other regions can be regarded as electrically neutral biesheuvel et al 2012 the modified donnan model was used to simulate the electric double layers biesheuvel et al 2011 the ion concentration in the flow electrodes and the desalination chamber can be calculated using the mass balance 4 c i t j i x u z c i z i represents the different ionic

rommerskirchen et al 2018b the result is eq 5 taking the aforementioned assumption into account 5 0 j i h u z d c i d z this equation is applied to the anode cathode and desalination chamber in eq 5 h represents the height of the respective flow channel a central part of this model is the electric potential balance we assume an externally applied constant electric potential difference which is

double layers in each flow electrode electrical double layer potentials the stern and donnan potentials φst and φd are considered in the boundary layers in front of the flow electrodes potentials for ion transport transport potentials φtransp are assumed which evoke ionic transport from the desalination chamber into the respective electrodes the potential balance eq 6 relates the cell potential to

area and the outer area of the micropore in the outer area of the micropore the ion concentration in the macropore is equal to the ion concentration outside the macropore so the outer area of the micropore can be equivalent to the macropore porada et al 2013 we used a modified donnan model to describe the relationship between the micropore and macropore ion concentrations 8 c a m i c r o c a m

the local current density is calculated by the sum of all species fluxes multiplied by the species valence in this model the iems are assumed to be ideally selective and thus only counter ions are

contribution the energy consumption of the fcdi module is divided into six components fig 2 the energy consumption due to stern potential in the micropores electrode stern the energy consumption due to donnan potential between the micropores and macropores electrode donnan the energy consumption due to ohmic resistances in the flow electrode electrode the energy consumption due to ohmic resistances in the iems membrane the energy consumption due to ion transport potential of iems membrane transport and the energy consumption due to ohmic resistances in the desalination chamber chamber replace the total applied voltage of eq 1 with the potential drop of each component φi the sec of each component of the fcdi cell can be further determined as eq 24 24 s e c δ φ i j a c 0 c e q 2 4 3 model validation the model described in the current work can simulate the steady state operation of a single fcdi desalination cell the desalination performance e g effluent conductivity and cell voltage calculated using the simulation is compared with the experimental data in this study the results are given in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 fcdi performance of different operation parameters according to most researches four parameters including the current density desalination chamber flow rate flow electrode flow rate and ac contents showing greater impact on energy consumption were chosen to examined thus the effects of these four operational parameters on the performance of fcdi were studied fig 3 a shows that the current density increased from 11 a m2 to 20 a m2 the effluent conductivity decreased from 1011 μs cm to 275 μs cm and the applied voltage increased from 0 27 v to 1 6 v when the current density increased from 17 a m2 to 20 a m2 the applied voltage increased sharply from 0 6 v to 1 6 v this was attributed to concentration polarization pan et al 2021 that means the ions near the membrane liquid interface layer in the desalination chamber quickly passed through the membrane to the electrode while the corresponding ions in the solution had no time to diffuse and replenish the interface as a consequence the ions in the membrane liquid interface layer of the desalination chamber were depleted and the concentration of ions reached zero resulting in a rapid increase in voltage rabiee et al 2019 fig 3b shows that when increasing the desalination chamber flow rate from 0 9 ml min to 2 7 ml min the effluent conductivity increased from 489 μs cm to 1598 μs cm this could be explained through mass balance eq 4 operation under single pass mode the ion concentration at each location of the desalination chamber was not changed with time after the system was stable then the left side in eq 1 is zero considering h and j is constant in our experiment is constant current mode the concentration gradient d c i dz is inversely proportional to the desalination chamber flow rate u z when the desalination chamber flow rate increases the concentration gradient decreases correspondingly which leads to an increase of the effluent conductivity fig 3c shows that with the increase in the flow electrode flow rate the effluent conductivity under a steady state decreased slightly this is because the higher flow electrode flow rate accelerates the renewal of the electrode solution fang et al 2020 and the adsorbed electrodes caused by ion migration were replaced by the mixed fresh flow electrode in the external container reducing the concentration difference across the iems fig 3d shows that under different ac contents no obvious difference in the effluent conductivity was observed compared with the flow electrode flow rate increasing the ac content had a lower effect on the effluent conductivity although changing the flow electrode flow rate and ac content basically did not change the effluent conductivity the increase of these two will reduce the applied voltage si table s2 3 2 effects of the operating parameters on the fcdi energy consumption 3 2 1 effect of current densities on fcdi energy consumption fig 4 a shows that as the current density increased from 11 a m2 to 20 a m2 the sec increased from 0 0286 j µmol to 0 154 j µmol and had a positive nonlinear relationship with the current density the sec nearly tripled from 0 0641 j µmol at 17 a m2 to 0 154 j µmol at 20 a m2 due to the significant concentration polarization at the same time the charge efficiency increased when the current density was less than 14 a m2 but gradually declined when the current density was higher than 14 a m2 at low current density the ion concentration gradient on both sides of the iems did not change significantly during the desalination process and the ion flux caused by the concentration diffusion was relatively constant and the ion flux increased with the increase in the current density which increased the charge efficiency liang et al 2017 at high current density the high ion removal rate resulted in an obvious concentration difference between the two sides of the iems which reduced the charge efficiency due to concentration polarization and reverse diffusion fang et al 2021 in fig 4b experimental results of sec were plotted as curves and the corresponding simulation results of each component were shown as histograms the results from the model are in agreement with the experimental data and had a reasonable error 10 since more than 80 of the sec of the fcdi module was consumed by the electrode resistance electrode ion transport potential of the membrane membrane transport and desalination chamber resistance chamber only the sec of these three parts was discussed in detail fig 4b shows that the sec of all components increased with the current density fig 4c shows that the sec of the electrode at various current densities accounted for about 50 of the total sec which is an important reason for the high energy consumption and the sec of membrane transport increased from 13 4 to 21 4 this increasing phenomenon might be attributed to the concentration polarization which increases the ion transport resistance of iems la cerva et al 2018 the higher current density resulted in lower conductivity in the desalination chamber which in turn increased the sec of the desalination chamber fig 4b since the total sec also increased nonlinearly at the same time the sec proportion of the desalination chamber was approximately 22 fig 4c 3 2 2 effect of desalination chamber flow rates on fcdi energy consumption fig 5 a shows that increasing the desalination chamber flow rate resulted in a charge efficiency decrease the reason for this was that more hydrolysis occured at high desalination chamber flow rates and caused more faradaic current which lead to a decrease in charge efficiency it can be also seen from other paper that the charge efficiency decreases with the flow rate increasing zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 shows that the ph in the cathode chamber slightly increase with the hydraulic retention time decrease that is more water hydrolysis occurs at high desalination chamber flow rates while the desalination chamber flow rate increased from 0 9 ml min to 1 35 ml min the sec decreased from 0 0641 j µmol to 0 043 j µmol when the desalination chamber flow rate exceeded 1 35 ml min no obvious difference in sec was observed fig 5b shows that the sec of the membrane transport was most sensitive to the desalination chamber flow rate as the desalination chamber flow rate increased the sec proportion of membrane transport gradually decreased fig 5c at 2 7 ml min the sec value of membrane transport only accounted for 6 5 the lower sec of membrane transport at higher desalination chamber flow rates is associated with enhanced solution convection and electroconvection at the iem solution interface balster et al 2007 which results in increased ion diffusivity of iems in addition another reason for the change in sec of membrane transport is the lower concentration difference between the electrode at higher desalination chamber flow rates which reduced the ion transport resistance of the iems tang et al 2020 at the same time the desalination chamber resistance also decreased at a high desalination chamber flow rate the low ion transport resistance and low desalination chamber resistance reduced the overall energy consumption of the fcdi module for the electrode since the electrode resistance was hardly affected by the desalination chamber flow rate when the total energy consumption of the fcdi module was reduced the sec proportion of the electrode increased 3 2 3 effect of flow electrode flow rates on fcdi energy consumption flow electrode flow rate is an important operational parameter in fcdi as it affects charge percolation carmona orbezo and dryfe 2021 fig 6 a shows that as the flow electrode flow rate increased from 5 ml min to 90 ml min the sec significantly decreased from 0 0883 j μmol to 0 0481 j μmol and the charge efficiency increased from 90 11 to 94 51 fig 6b shows that the sec of electrode and membrane transport decreased rapidly at high flow electrode flow rates the higher flow electrode flow rate accelerated the regeneration of the flow electrode reducing the ion concentration in the bulk solution and ion back diffusion in the electrode flow fang et al 2020 which caused the sec of the electrode and membrane transport to decrease in addition the high flow electrode flow rate also increased the carbon particle collision frequency and improved charge percolation which decreased the sec of the electrode heidarian et al 2021 however when the desalination process is carried out at extremely high flow electrode flow rates additional pumping costs should be considered rommerskirchen et al 2018a it can be seen from fig 6c that the sec proportion of the electrode decreased significantly as the flow electrode flow rate increased while the sec proportion of the chamber increased when the flow electrode flow rate increased from 5 ml min to 90 ml min the contribution of the chamber to the sec increased from 14 6 to 33 3 and the sec of the electrode decreased from 58 6 to 31 4 overall increasing the flow electrode flow rate can reduce sec of electrode which can be attributed to the high conductivity of the flow electrodes the consumption of the desalination chamber dominated the sec when using a high flow electrode flow rate thus optimization strategies should also be taken to optimize the energy consumption of the desalination chamber 3 2 4 effect of ac contents on fcdi energy consumption the ac content of the electrode is another critical parameter for the operation of the fcdi module as shown in fig 7 a the sec showed a similar change trend to the situation of changing the flow electrode flow rates increasing the ac content led to a total sec reduction from 0 0842 j µmol to 0 0523 j µmol which can be attributed to the higher conductivity of the flow electrode with higher ac content cohen et al 2016 but the influence on charge efficiency was not significant fig 7b shows that the ac content mainly changed the sec of the electrode while the sec of the chamber and membrane transport changed very little this is obviously different from the results of changing the flow electrode flow rate it can be seen from fig 7c that the sec proportion of the electrode decreased from 62 9 to 31 8 with increasing ac content while the proportion of sec in both the membrane transport and chamber increased significantly their contributions to the overall energy consumption became more dominant under a higher ac content when the ac content increased from 5 wt to 15 wt the contribution of membrane transport to sec increased from 15 1 to 25 1 and the sec of chamber increased from 15 6 to 30 9 increasing the ac content can reduce the sec of the electrode which can be attributed to the high conductivity of the flow electrode cohen et al 2016 the proportion of sec in the iems and desalination chamber gradually increased when a high ac content was used therefore optimization strategies should be adopted to improve the energy efficiencies of iems and desalination chambers overall sec was affected by many factors such as the current density desalination chamber flow rate and flow electrode flow rate in most cases the flow electrode consumed the highest amount of energy in the situation of lower current density or a higher desalination chamber flow rate total sec was relatively low and the sec of the electrode accounted for the majority and optimization of the electrode resistance significantly reduced the total sec increasing the current density or reducing the desalination chamber flow rate to increase the removal efficiency will lead to an increase in the total sec and more energy consumed on the iems and in the desalination chamber this is a trade off between the removal efficiency and sec liu and smith 2018 changing the operational parameters such as increasing the flow electrode flow rate and ac content can reduce the sec of the electrode and total sec while the sec from the iems and desalination chamber could not be significantly reduced under higher flow electrode flow rate and ac content their contributions to the overall energy consumption could became dominant this shows that the factors that limit the sec reduction of the device are not only the electrode resistance but also the transport potential of iems and the desalination chamber resistance thus optimizing each component of the fcdi is inevitable to further reduce energy consumption 3 3 optimizing fcdi by adding titanium mesh we tried to add titanium mesh to the fcdi device to optimize the sec of each component at the same time thus further decreasing the total energy consumption as shown in fig 8 a the sec of the fcdi ti 0 0421 j µmol was much lower than that of the ordinary fcdi 0 0641 j µmol which saved 34 3 sec as can be seen from the model the decrease in total sec was mainly caused by the decrease in the sec of the electrode and the sec of the membrane transport also decreased slightly this shows that adding titanium mesh to the electrode can not only reduce the resistance of the electrode yang et al 2019 but also improve the ion transfer capacity of the iems the fcdi ti ti structure further reduced the sec and the sec decreased to 0 0308 j µmol there were mainly two reasons for energy consumption decreasing firstly it was due to decreasing sec of the chamber and membrane transport on one hand the addition of titanium mesh to the desalination chamber could reduce the desalination chamber resistance on the other hand it can also effectively improve the convection and electroconvection conditions around the membrane and increase the ion transport capacity at the membrane solution interface tang and zhou 2020 which is extremely beneficial for fcdi devices to study the long term stability of the fcdi module with titanium mesh the fcdi ti ti was operated continuously for 12 h in single pass mode fig 8b shows the cycling performance of fcdi ti ti under constant parameters the cycling experiment was carried out under a current density of 17 a m2 an electrode flow rate of 30 ml min an influent flow rate of the desalination chamber of 5 ml min and an ac content of 10 each cycle included a charge period of 30 min and a discharge period of 30 min the sec asrr and charging efficiency did not change significantly over 12 cycles and the salt removal rate remained at 78 per cycle indicating that the system has good long term stability and repeatability overall fcdi ti ti was an effective improvement strategy the energy consumption of the device in this study was relatively lower compared with other latest published literatures si table s3 in general using titanium mesh to reduce the resistance of fcdi and improve the ion transport conditions of iems can effectively improve the energy consumption of the device and the model is an effective tool for targeted optimization of fcdi modules it should be mentioned that ti mesh in electrode chamber of fcdi ti ti system was covered by carbon powder after 12 cycles but the pore size of the mesh was not significantly decreased the pictures of electrode chamber ti mesh before used and after 12 cycles operating were shown in si s6 due to the main purpose of this study is the improvement of fcdi system from energy consumption aspect so scaling is temporarily out of the consideration of our article but the effect of scaling on the device may affect the performance on a longer time scale which need to be examined in the future study besides the result of this study highlight the importance of conductivity of iems and spacer sheet of desalination chamber to decreasing energy consumption thus it was prospective modification direction to develop conductive iems which could both decrease energy consumption and minimize scaling problems as much as possible while it was also meaningful to select economical durable conductive spacer sheet besides ti mesh 4 conclusion in this work we established a process model for continuous fcdi processes not only does the model yield a very good description of the experimental data it can also well describe the energy distribution of each component in fcdi the results showed that more than 80 of the sec of the fcdi module was consumed by the electrode resistance ion transport potential of the membrane and desalination chamber resistance the energy consumption of the electrode always dominated under different operating scenarios as increasing the flow electrode flow rate and ac content can obviously reduce the sec proportion of the electrode the optimization of both the iems and the desalination chamber should be considered at this time to further reduce the energy consumption of fcdi titanium mesh was added to the electrode and desalination chamber which effectively improved the charge efficiency and reduced the energy consumption furthermore the optimized fcdi with titanium mesh showed good long term stability and repeatability overall the established process model can be used for theoretical investigation and enhancing our fundamental understanding of the energy consumption of each fcdi component providing the design and optimization of fcdi systems lastly we put forward some ideas regarding commercialization first fcdi consumes relatively high amounts of energy compared with other conventional desalination technologies it is necessary to decrease energy consumption from the aspects of improving electrode materials interface resistance etc second most of the current fcdi devices use traditional serpentine flow channels however processing long and narrow flow channels is complex and the cost of processing long and narrow flow channels is expensive which limits the scale up of the device new designs for fcdi electrodes with improved ease of fabrication and greater effective area are therefore needed the tubular flow channel seems suitable as the electrode flow channel the tubular flow channel shows a greater contact area than the traditional flow channel for the same device volume which is more beneficial to increase the charge percolation and tubular flow channel is less prone to clogging or scaling many explorations should be done to apply fcdi in the real water treatment third besides energy consumpiton by ion separation energy consumption by pumping is also very important in practical applications yet it has received less attention many explorations should be done to apply fcdi in the real water treatment declaration of competing interest the

15148,flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is a new technology for ion removal that delivers sustainable deionization performance however fcdi consumes relatively high amounts of energy compared with other conventional desalination technologies which hinders the industrial application of fcdi in this study the energy consumption of each fcdi component was simulated using a steady state fcdi model to investigate and optimize the main components of energy consumption overall the established process model can be used for theoretical investigation and enhancing our fundamental understanding of the energy consumption of each fcdi component and provides the design and optimization of fcdi systems the results showed that the energy consumption of the flow electrodes dominated under most conditions changing the operating parameters could obviously affect energy consumption and the energy consumption structure however increasing the flow rate and activated carbon ac content of the flow electrode could decrease the energy consumption of the electrode and the energy consumed by the ion exchange membranes iems and desalination chamber was the greatest these two parts of energy consumption could not be significantly reduced by changing operational parameters thus to further reduce the energy consumption optimization of the fcdi equipment was carried out by adding titanium mesh to the flow electrodes and the desalination chamber of the fcdi cell the results showed that the energy consumption of optimized fcdi decreased by 51 9 compared with the original fcdi the long term experiment using optimized fcdi showed good stability and repeatability keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization process model energy consumption energy consumption structure titanium mesh long term stability data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in recent years capacitive deionization cdi has emerged as a promising technology for the facile removal of charged ionic species from aqueous solutions mainly used in brackish water desalination ion removal in wastewater and resource recovery of nutrients such as n and p lin et al 2020 during the cdi process ions transported from the desalination chamber to the electrode are stored in an electric double layer on a porous carbon electrode by applying an electric field xing et al 2020 however for conventional cdi the ion removal capacity is restricted due to the static features of the electrode when the electrode is saturated with ions it needs to be regenerated via a short circuit or reversely connected which leads to intermittent operation and relatively low flow efficiency wei et al 2020 flow electrode cdi fcdi which uses a flowable carbon suspension electrode offers great advantages over conventional cdi due to its facile electrode preparation large adsorption ability continuous ion removal and high water recovery rate lim et al 2020 tang et al 2020 it is progressing toward various applications in multiple industrial areas however there are still great challenges to be applied in real cases especially as fcdi consumes relatively high amounts of energy compared with other conventional desalination technologies i e reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed hatzell et al 2015 mitko et al 2021 qin et al 2019 many researches have been done to examine what factors affect and how to decrease energy consumption fcdi consumed studies have shown that the conductivity of the flow electrode is usually around 0 1 1 ms cm because the majority of the carbon particles do not contribute to the charge transfer in the electrode which results in high energy consumption during fcdi operation doornbusch et al 2016 porada et al 2014 it was reported that a higher ac content in the flow electrode can increase conductivity and result in lower energy consumption wei et al 2020 with increasing ac content of the electrode a multitude of charge percolation networks could be developed which dramatically increased the number of charged particles and the conductivity of the electrode lohaus et al 2019 given the fact that too high an ac content showing high viscosity characteristic is prone to clogging the carbon content of the electrode of fcdi generally lies within a range of 5 20 wt dahiya and mishra 2020 porada et al 2014 several studies optimized the rheological properties of electrodes to increase the carbon content hatzell et al 2015 increased the ac content to 28 by enriching the surface of the activated carbon with oxygen heteroatoms as the modified 28 ac displayed similar viscosities to the unmodified 20 ac it is also possible to improve carbon loading by changing the flow channel structure doornbusch et al 2016 increased the ac content in the flow electrode to 35 through an innovative fluidized bed process pan et al 2021 prepared new functionalized current collector possessed higher charge efficiency ce of 81 24 and lower normalized energy consumption of 237 54 j mmol several researchers aimed to accelerate the charge transfer and facilitate ion adsorption from the aspect of slurry electrode characteristic optimization chen et al 2022 liang et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2019 liang et al 2017 added 1 cb to a 20 carbon content flow electrode effectively increasing the desalination rate and reducing energy consumption wei et al 2020 added a ferri ferrocyanide redox couple to the electrode the energy consumption was reduced from 410 26 kj mol to 102 28 kj mol at a current density of 2 38 ma cm2 luo et al 2022 prepared zif 8 derived nanocarbon materials and obtained superior performance some other studies increased electrode conductivity by optimizing the charge transfer pathway yang et al 2019 inserted a titanium mesh current collector between the ion exchange membrane iem and the perspex sheet which caused the salt removal rate to increase by about 76 zhang et al 2022 innovatively utilized the three dimensional 3d carbon coated nickel foam as current collector which strengthen the charge transfer ability of fcdi device achieving distinguished desalination efficiency for real seawater however most studies were limited to focusing on how the electrode resistance and overall desalination performance changed therefore in depth analysis of the fundamentals of the changes in fcdi energy consumption is necessary some energy consumption research methods and characterization tools were tried to explore fundamentals of the fcdi energy consumption changes firstly electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis is used to reveal the internal resistance change of the electrode some studies use the eis method to discuss the resistance change and distribution choo et al 2017 halfon and suss 2019 but eis cannot be used to systematically discuss the resistance distribution of the whole cell to further quantify the potential drop and resistance distribution across the system luo et al 2021 presented an in situ potential measurement method ispm to fractionate the energy cost contribution of each fcdi component during desalination however the potential drop of each component of the fcdi module has spatial variation so the result depends on the measurement position wang et al 2020 in the single pass mode of fcdi parameters such as the cell voltage and desalination rate are considered to be in a steady state thus all time dependencies vanish dykstra et al 2017 the energy consumption contribution of each component of the fcdi module in a steady state can be calculated by estimating the potential drop of each component therefore some studies have carried out related research using models wang et al 2020 carried out a theoretical study of the potential drop of fcdi components through the equivalent thin film electrode efe model and calculated the potential distribution of each component of the fcdi module at different relative positions but charge percolation via particle collision is ignored in the model rommerskirchen et al 2018b assumed equal distribution of potential over the whole cell and established a process model to describe the cell geometries and processes by constructing the potential balance however the model is also limited to the analysis of the overall performance of the device and the mechanisms of the operation parameters affecting the energy consumption of each component have not been discussed in details at present a new model analysis method is needed to quantify the distribution of voltage and energy consumption in each part of the fcdi system to discuss mechanisms of energy consumption changing under different operation parameters so as to optimize high energy consumption parts in this study an electrochemical model was developed to characterize the energy consumption of the steady state fcdi process in addition the energy consumption distribution of each component of fcdi under different operating conditions such as different current densities desalination chamber flow rates flow electrode flow rates and ac contents was simulated and fcdi optimization suggestions were put forward according to model results according to the energy consumption characteristics the fcdi module was optimized a titanium mesh was added between the graphite plate and the iems and or the desalination chamber to reduce the resistance and improve the charge transfer rate furthermore a 12 h long term continuous operation was also performed to evaluate the operation stability of the optimized system 2 materials and methods

distribution of the potential drops of each component of the fcdi module was quantitatively modeled using a one dimensional steady state process model valid for single pass mode experiments that was developed based on the approach used by rommerskirchen et al 2020 and wang et al 2020 assuming that ions transported into the flow electrodes are stored in the electric double layer on the surface of the activated carbon micropores in the electrode solution other regions can be regarded as electrically neutral biesheuvel et al 2012 the modified donnan model was used to simulate the electric double

rommerskirchen et al 2018b the result is eq 5 taking the aforementioned assumption into account 5 0 j i h u z d c i d z this equation is applied to the anode cathode and desalination chamber in eq 5 h represents the height of the respective flow channel a central part of this model is the electric potential balance we assume an externally applied constant electric potential difference which is

double layers in each flow electrode electrical double layer potentials the stern and donnan potentials φst and φd are considered in the boundary layers in front of the flow electrodes potentials for ion transport transport potentials φtransp are assumed which evoke ionic transport from the desalination chamber into the respective electrodes the potential balance eq 6 relates the cell potential to

area and the outer area of the micropore in the outer area of the micropore the ion concentration in the macropore is equal to the ion concentration outside the macropore so the outer area of the micropore can be equivalent to the macropore porada et al 2013 we used a modified donnan model to describe the relationship between the micropore and macropore ion concentrations 8 c a m i c r o c a m

the local current density is calculated by the sum of all species fluxes multiplied by the species valence in this model the iems are assumed to be ideally selective and thus only counter ions are

contribution the energy consumption of the fcdi module is divided into six components fig 2 the energy consumption due to stern potential in the micropores electrode stern the energy consumption due to donnan potential between the micropores and macropores electrode donnan the energy consumption due to ohmic resistances in the flow electrode electrode the energy consumption due to ohmic resistances in the iems membrane the energy consumption due to ion transport potential of iems membrane transport and the energy consumption due to ohmic resistances in the desalination chamber chamber replace the total applied voltage of eq 1 with the potential drop of each component φi the sec of each component of the fcdi cell can be further determined as eq 24 24 s e c δ φ i j a c 0 c e q 2 4 3 model validation the model described in the current work can simulate the steady state operation of a single fcdi desalination cell the desalination performance e g effluent conductivity and cell voltage calculated using the simulation is compared with the experimental data in this study the results are given in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 fcdi performance of different operation parameters according to most researches four parameters including the current density desalination chamber flow rate flow electrode flow rate and ac contents showing greater impact on energy consumption were chosen to examined thus the effects of these four operational parameters on the performance of fcdi were studied fig 3 a shows that the current density increased from 11 a m2 to 20 a m2 the effluent conductivity decreased from 1011 μs cm to 275 μs cm and the applied voltage increased from 0 27 v to 1 6 v when the current density increased from 17 a m2 to 20 a m2 the applied voltage increased sharply from 0 6 v to 1 6 v this was attributed to concentration polarization pan et al 2021 that means the ions near the membrane liquid interface layer in the desalination chamber quickly passed through the membrane to the electrode while the corresponding ions in the solution had no time to diffuse and replenish the interface as a consequence the ions in the membrane liquid interface layer of the desalination chamber were depleted and the concentration of ions reached zero resulting in a rapid increase in voltage rabiee et al 2019 fig 3b shows that when increasing the desalination chamber flow rate from 0 9 ml min to 2 7 ml min the effluent conductivity increased from 489 μs cm to 1598 μs cm this could be explained through mass balance eq 4 operation under single pass mode the ion concentration at each location of the desalination chamber was not changed with time after the system was stable then the left side in eq 1 is zero considering h and j is constant in our experiment is constant current mode the concentration gradient d c i dz is inversely proportional to the desalination chamber flow rate u z when the desalination chamber flow rate increases the concentration gradient decreases correspondingly which leads to an increase of the effluent conductivity fig 3c shows that with the increase in the flow electrode flow rate the effluent conductivity under a steady state decreased slightly this is because the higher flow electrode flow rate accelerates the renewal of the electrode solution fang et al 2020 and the adsorbed electrodes caused by ion migration were replaced by the mixed fresh flow electrode in the external container reducing the concentration difference across the iems fig 3d shows that under different ac contents no obvious difference in the effluent conductivity was observed compared with the flow electrode flow rate increasing the ac content had a lower effect on the effluent conductivity although changing the flow electrode flow rate and ac content basically did not change the effluent conductivity the increase of these two will reduce the applied voltage si table s2 3 2 effects of the operating parameters on the fcdi energy consumption 3 2 1 effect of current densities on fcdi energy consumption fig 4 a shows that as the current density increased from 11 a m2 to 20 a m2 the sec increased from 0 0286 j µmol to 0 154 j µmol and had a positive nonlinear relationship with the current density the sec nearly tripled from 0 0641 j µmol at 17 a m2 to 0 154 j µmol at 20 a m2 due to the significant concentration polarization at the same time the charge efficiency increased when the current density was less than 14 a m2 but gradually declined when the current density was higher than 14 a m2 at low current density the ion concentration gradient on both sides of the iems did not change significantly during the desalination process and the ion flux caused by the concentration diffusion was relatively constant and the ion flux increased with the increase in the current density which increased the charge efficiency liang et al 2017 at high current density the high ion removal rate resulted in an obvious concentration difference between the two sides of the iems which reduced the charge efficiency due to concentration polarization and reverse diffusion fang et al 2021 in fig 4b experimental results of sec were plotted as curves and the corresponding simulation results of each component were shown as histograms the results from the model are in agreement with the experimental data and had a reasonable error 10 since more than 80 of the sec of the fcdi module was consumed by the electrode resistance electrode ion transport potential of the membrane membrane transport and desalination chamber resistance chamber only the sec of these three parts was discussed in detail fig 4b shows that the sec of all components increased with the current density fig 4c shows that the sec of the electrode at various current densities accounted for about 50 of the total sec which is an important reason for the high energy consumption and the sec of membrane transport increased from 13 4 to 21 4 this increasing phenomenon might be attributed to the concentration polarization which increases the ion transport resistance of iems la cerva et al 2018 the higher current density resulted in lower conductivity in the desalination chamber which in turn increased the sec of the desalination chamber fig 4b since the total sec also increased nonlinearly at the same time the sec proportion of the desalination chamber was approximately 22 fig 4c 3 2 2 effect of desalination chamber flow rates on fcdi energy consumption fig 5 a shows that increasing the desalination chamber flow rate resulted in a charge efficiency decrease the reason for this was that more hydrolysis occured at high desalination chamber flow rates and caused more faradaic current which lead to a decrease in charge efficiency it can be also seen from other paper that the charge efficiency decreases with the flow rate increasing zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 shows that the ph in the cathode chamber slightly increase with the hydraulic retention time decrease that is more water hydrolysis occurs at high desalination chamber flow rates while the desalination chamber flow rate increased from 0 9 ml min to 1 35 ml min the sec decreased from 0 0641 j µmol to 0 043 j µmol when the desalination chamber flow rate exceeded 1 35 ml min no obvious difference in sec was observed fig 5b shows that the sec of the membrane transport was most sensitive to the desalination chamber flow rate as the desalination chamber flow rate increased the sec proportion of membrane transport gradually decreased fig 5c at 2 7 ml min the sec value of membrane transport only accounted for 6 5 the lower sec of membrane transport at higher desalination chamber flow rates is associated with enhanced solution convection and electroconvection at the iem solution interface balster et al 2007 which results in increased ion diffusivity of iems in addition another reason for the change in sec of membrane transport is the lower concentration difference between the electrode at higher desalination chamber flow rates which reduced the ion transport resistance of the iems tang et al 2020 at the same time the desalination chamber resistance also decreased at a high desalination chamber flow rate the low ion transport resistance and low desalination chamber resistance reduced the overall energy consumption of the fcdi module for the electrode since the electrode resistance was hardly affected by the desalination chamber flow rate when the total energy consumption of the fcdi module was reduced the sec proportion of the electrode increased 3 2 3 effect of flow electrode flow rates on fcdi energy consumption flow electrode flow rate is an important operational parameter in fcdi as it affects charge percolation carmona orbezo and dryfe 2021 fig 6 a shows that as the flow electrode flow rate increased from 5 ml min to 90 ml min the sec significantly decreased from 0 0883 j μmol to 0 0481 j μmol and the charge efficiency increased from 90 11 to 94 51 fig 6b shows that the sec of electrode and membrane transport decreased rapidly at high flow electrode flow rates the higher flow electrode flow rate accelerated the regeneration of the flow electrode reducing the ion concentration in the bulk solution and ion back diffusion in the electrode flow fang et al 2020 which caused the sec of the electrode and membrane transport to decrease in addition the high flow electrode flow rate also increased the carbon particle collision frequency and improved charge percolation which decreased the sec of the electrode heidarian et al 2021 however when the desalination process is carried out at extremely high flow electrode flow rates additional pumping costs should be considered rommerskirchen et al 2018a it can be seen from fig 6c that the sec proportion of the electrode decreased significantly as the flow electrode flow rate increased while the sec proportion of the chamber increased when the flow electrode flow rate increased from 5 ml min to 90 ml min the contribution of the chamber to the sec increased from 14 6 to 33 3 and the sec of the electrode decreased from 58 6 to 31 4 overall increasing the flow electrode flow rate can reduce sec of electrode which can be attributed to the high conductivity of the flow electrodes the consumption of the desalination chamber dominated the sec when using a high flow electrode flow rate thus optimization strategies should also be taken to optimize the energy consumption of the desalination chamber 3 2 4 effect of ac contents on fcdi energy consumption the ac content of the electrode is another critical parameter for the operation of the fcdi module as shown in fig 7 a the sec showed a similar change trend to the situation of changing the flow electrode flow rates increasing the ac content led to a total sec reduction from 0 0842 j µmol to 0 0523 j µmol which can be attributed to the higher conductivity of the flow electrode with higher ac content cohen et al 2016 but the influence on charge efficiency was not significant fig 7b shows that the ac content mainly changed the sec of the electrode while the sec of the chamber and membrane transport changed very little this is obviously different from the results of changing the flow electrode flow rate it can be seen from fig 7c that the sec proportion of the electrode decreased from 62 9 to 31 8 with increasing ac content while the proportion of sec in both the membrane transport and chamber increased significantly their contributions to the overall energy consumption became more dominant under a higher ac content when the ac content increased from 5 wt to 15 wt the contribution of membrane transport to sec increased from 15 1 to 25 1 and the sec of chamber increased from 15 6 to 30 9 increasing the ac content can reduce the sec of the electrode which can be attributed to the high conductivity of the flow electrode cohen et al 2016 the proportion of sec in the iems and desalination chamber gradually increased when a high ac content was used therefore optimization strategies should be adopted to improve the energy efficiencies of iems and desalination chambers overall sec was affected by many factors such as the current density desalination chamber flow rate and flow electrode flow rate in most cases the flow electrode consumed the highest amount of energy in the situation of lower current density or a higher desalination chamber flow rate total sec was relatively low and the sec of the electrode accounted for the majority and optimization of the electrode resistance significantly reduced the total sec increasing the current density or reducing the desalination chamber flow rate to increase the removal efficiency will lead to an increase in the total sec and more energy consumed on the iems and in the desalination chamber this is a trade off between the removal efficiency and sec liu and smith 2018 changing the operational parameters such as increasing the flow electrode flow rate and ac content can reduce the sec of the electrode and total sec while the sec from the iems and desalination chamber could not be significantly reduced under higher flow electrode flow rate and ac content their contributions to the overall energy consumption could became dominant this shows that the factors that limit the sec reduction of the device are not only the electrode resistance but also the transport potential of iems and the desalination chamber resistance thus optimizing each component of the fcdi is inevitable to further reduce energy consumption 3 3 optimizing fcdi by adding titanium mesh we tried to add titanium mesh to the fcdi device to optimize the sec of each component at the same time thus further decreasing the total energy consumption as shown in fig 8 a the sec of the fcdi ti 0 0421 j µmol was much lower than that of the ordinary fcdi 0 0641 j µmol which saved 34 3 sec as can be seen from the model the decrease in total sec was mainly caused by the decrease in the sec of the electrode and the sec of the membrane transport also decreased slightly this shows that adding titanium mesh to the electrode can not only reduce the resistance of the electrode yang et al 2019 but also improve the ion transfer capacity of the iems the fcdi ti ti structure further reduced the sec and the sec decreased to 0 0308 j µmol there were mainly two reasons for energy consumption decreasing firstly it was due to decreasing sec of the chamber and membrane transport on one hand the addition of titanium mesh to the desalination chamber could reduce the desalination chamber resistance on the other hand it can also effectively improve the convection and electroconvection conditions around the membrane and increase the ion transport capacity at the membrane solution interface tang and zhou 2020 which is extremely beneficial for fcdi devices to study the long term stability of the fcdi module with titanium mesh the fcdi ti ti was operated continuously for 12 h in single pass mode fig 8b shows the cycling performance of fcdi ti ti under constant parameters the cycling experiment was carried out under a current density of 17 a m2 an electrode flow rate of 30 ml min an influent flow rate of the desalination chamber of 5 ml min and an ac content of 10 each cycle included a charge period of 30 min and a discharge period of 30 min the sec asrr and charging efficiency did not change significantly over 12 cycles and the salt removal rate remained at 78 per cycle indicating that the system has good long term stability and repeatability overall fcdi ti ti was an effective improvement strategy the energy consumption of the device in this study was relatively lower compared with other latest published literatures si table s3 in general using titanium mesh to reduce the resistance of fcdi and improve the ion transport conditions of iems can effectively improve the energy consumption of the device and the model is an effective tool for targeted optimization of fcdi modules it should be mentioned that ti mesh in electrode chamber of fcdi ti ti system was covered by carbon powder after 12 cycles but the pore size of the mesh was not significantly decreased the pictures of electrode chamber ti mesh before used and after 12 cycles operating were shown in si s6 due to the main purpose of this study is the improvement of fcdi system from energy consumption aspect so scaling is temporarily out of the consideration of our article but the effect of scaling on the device may affect the performance on a longer time scale which need to be examined in the future study besides the result of this study highlight the importance of conductivity of iems and spacer sheet of desalination chamber to decreasing energy consumption thus it was prospective modification direction to develop conductive iems which could both decrease energy consumption and minimize scaling problems as much as possible while it was also meaningful to select economical durable conductive spacer sheet besides ti mesh 4 conclusion in this work we established a process model for continuous fcdi processes not only does the model yield a very good description of the experimental data it can also well describe the energy distribution of each component in fcdi the results showed that more than 80 of the sec of the fcdi module was consumed by the electrode resistance ion transport potential of the membrane and desalination chamber resistance the energy consumption of the electrode always dominated under different operating scenarios as increasing the flow electrode flow rate and ac content can obviously reduce the sec proportion of the electrode the optimization of both the iems and the desalination chamber should be considered at this time to further reduce the energy consumption of fcdi titanium mesh was added to the electrode and desalination chamber which effectively improved the charge efficiency and reduced the energy consumption furthermore the optimized fcdi with titanium mesh showed good long term stability and repeatability overall the established process model can be used for theoretical investigation and enhancing our fundamental understanding of the energy consumption of each fcdi component providing the design and optimization of fcdi systems lastly we put forward some ideas regarding commercialization first fcdi consumes relatively high amounts of energy compared with other conventional desalination technologies it is necessary to decrease energy consumption from the aspects of improving electrode materials interface resistance etc second most of the current fcdi devices use traditional serpentine flow channels however processing long and narrow flow channels is complex and the cost of processing long and narrow flow channels is expensive which limits the scale up of the device new designs for fcdi electrodes with improved ease of fabrication and greater effective area are therefore needed the tubular flow channel seems suitable as the electrode flow channel the tubular flow channel shows a greater contact area than the traditional flow channel for the same device volume which is more beneficial to increase the charge percolation and tubular flow channel is less prone to clogging or scaling many explorations should be done to apply fcdi in the real water treatment third besides energy consumpiton by ion separation energy consumption by pumping is also very important in practical applications yet it has received less attention many explorations should be done to apply fcdi in the real water treatment declaration of competing interest the

15149,the discharge of h2s scavenging wastewaters containing spent and unspent scavengers sus into the marine environment is a large contributor to the environmental impact of offshore oil and gas production hydrothermal oxidation hto can be a viable method for on site treatment of the sus before discharge but the effect of the process on the ecotoxicity of the effluent has not been investigated so far the aim of this study was to investigate the potential of the hto technology in reducing the environmental impact by linking the chemical process design with ecotoxicity reduction for this we combined hto experiments on a sus sample from an oil and gas platform in the north sea with whole effluent ecotoxicity evaluation before and after the treatment the hto process was carried out under excess of oxygen for temperatures and pressures in the range 199 to 350 c and 83 to 228 bar respectively and for reaction times of 5 to 360 min initially the sus sample exhibited very high ecotoxicity which was drastically reduced by the hto process more specifically the ecotoxicity towards bacteria was reduced more than 90 for all hto conditions while the reduction in algal toxicity was in the range 48 to 66 59 to 86 and 60 to 82 at reaction temperatures of 199 c 279 c and 350 c respectively furthermore this work shows how typical wastewater chemical analyses such as cod and toc and ecotoxicity tests towards different organisms provide complementary information which should be used in combination to optimize operating conditions of the hto process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wet oxidation h2s scavengers spent scavengers offshore oil and gas marine toxicity environmental impact factor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction produced water from offshore oil and gas production is one of the largest industrial direct discharges into the marine environment estimated to 324 million m3 annually in the north sea karman and smit 2019 neff et al 2011 scholten et al 2000 while the discharge has been associated with detrimental effects on the environment it is a relative dilute stream and diverse in terms of chemical composition hence difficult to treat alternatively to reduce the overall environmental impact smaller and more concentrated streams can be identified in offshore oil and gas production and treated prior to discharge an example of such a stream is the wastewater from the h2s scavenging of natural gas that results from the injection of aqueous h2s scavengers aiming to convert the highly toxic and corrosive h2s to less harmful compounds kelland 2014 the h2s scavenger is typically based on 1 3 5 hexahydrotriazines henceforth triazines that are widely used in the field and particularly water soluble variants such as 1 3 5 tri 2 hydroxyethyl hexahydro s triazine het also known as mea triazine kelland 2014 taylor et al 2019 since het is typically injected in stoichiometric excess with respect to h2s it ends up partly unreacted unspent scavenger together with the reaction products spent scavengers in the wastewater stream that is separated from the natural gas kelland 2014 montesantos et al 2022 in line with the reaction scheme generally accepted in the literature the main scavenging reaction products that appear in the spent scavenger wastewater are monoethanolamine mea and 5 2 hydroxyethyl hexahydro 1 3 5 dithiazine dtz bakke et al 2001 romero et al 2021 taylor and matherly 2010 the injection formulation also contains trace amounts of formaldehyde which is one of the reactants used for het synthesis kelland 2014 while the h2s scavenging reaction reduces the operational and occupational challenges associated with h2s the environmental impact of the discharge is high due to persistency and ecotoxicity of the associated compounds in fact it has been reported that the discharge associated to h2s scavenging contribute up to 20 of the overall environmental impact factor eif of north sea offshore platforms reed and rye 2011 stipanicev et al 2018 in some installations of the north sea it was estimated that this discharge contributes for more than 10 of the total eif while being less than 0 1 in volume of the total produced water consequently it is apparent that the treatment of this relatively small but highly concentrated stream can conveniently provide a significant decrease in the overall environmental impact of discharges associated with offshore oil and gas production hydrothermal oxidation hto of the spent unspent scavenger sus prior to discharge has recently been suggested as an efficient way to reduce the environmental impact of offshore discharge montesantos et al 2022 subcritical i e 150 320 c hto using air as oxidant referred industrially as wet air oxidation is commonly used to remove organic pollutants in different industrial wastewater streams with moderate to high chemical oxygen demand 20 200 g l cod yousefifar et al 2017 this process is commonly applied prior to biological treatment to reduce the wastewater toxicity kolaczkowski et al 1999 hto has minimal energy requirements since after start up it can be autothermally sustained due to the exothermic oxidation reactions that produce enough heat when the cod exceeds 12 15 g l debellefontaine and foussard 2000 in our laboratory activities in connection with offshore oil and gas operations we have measured values of cod for the sus in the range 120 to 320 g l i e well above the threshold for ensuring an autothermal process montesantos et al 2022 provided a proof of concept of the hto process by testing the technology on a sus sample at low 200 c and high temperature 350 c a substantial reduction of cod was observed with more than 50 reduction after 40 min at 200 c while at 350 c 85 of cod was removed in 10 min the possibility of attaining large cod reductions at low reaction times and the relatively low flow rates of the sus stream suggested the feasibility of a small volume hto unit to be installed offshore where low footprint and low weight are important constraints while the removal of cod was pronounced an extensive analysis of the reaction products revealed c1 c4 carboxylic acids up to 1 5 g kg and small amounts of pyridines and pyrazines up to 330 mg kg in the hto effluent since the target of the on site hto treatment is to drastically reduce the environmental impact of the sus wastewater discharge it is deemed necessary to combine the chemical characterization e g cod to ecotoxicity tests to evaluate the effect of the discharge on the aquatic environment and to link it with the operating parameters of the hto process thus the aim of this work is to assess the efficiency of hto in reducing the ecotoxicity of the sus and to provide a combined basis i e chemical and ecotoxicological for process design the hto study was performed at three temperature levels 199 c 279 c and 350 c and for reaction times ranging from 5 to 360 min the ecotoxicity was assessed using two different species in standardized test setups covering acute toxicity using luminescence decrease of bacteria aliivibrio fischeri after 15 and 30 min of exposure and acute chronic toxicity using growth inhibition of marine algae skeletonema pseudocostatum after 72 h of exposure 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the sus was retrieved from

temperature hpht reactor following a procedure described in detail in a previous work montesantos et al 2022 in short approximately 20 g of deionized water was precharged into the reactor vessel and after the vessel was sealed it was purged and pressurized to 35 bar with o2 the o2 pressure was selected to ensure that for all experiments the available o2 was equal or higher than the initial cod i e cod0 in the reactor i e 106 145 of cod0 consequently the reactor was heated to the selected reaction temperature and when that temperature was reached approximately 30 g of prediluted approximately twofold dilution with demineralized water sus was injected to the reactor the cod0 in the reactor was calculated considering the predilution prior to the injection as well as the further dilution in the reactor due to the precharged water henceforth the diluted sus i e approximately fivefold dilution is considered the feed of the hto reactions in total 21 hto experiments were performed at 3 temperatures 199 c 1 c 279 c 1 c 350 c 2 c and 4 5 reaction times 5 360 min the reaction pressures were 88 bar 1 bar 124 bar 7 bar and 215 bar 8 bar for the reactions at 199 c 279 c and 350 c respectively to verify reproducibility duplicate experiments were performed at 199 c and 40 min 279 c and 10 min 350 c and 10 min as well as 360 min while the experiments at 350 c and 40 min were performed in triplicate when the reaction time was elapsed the reaction products were ejected through a tap water cooled condenser into a cold dry trap gas washing bottle immersed in ice and water and the collected aqueous effluent was used for analytical characterization and ecotoxicity tests the reaction conditions for all the experiments are reported in table s1 in the supplementary information 2 3 analytical characterization the analytical characterization of the sus and the hto effluent samples was performed utilizing the methodologies reported in a previous work montesantos et al 2022 in short the composition of the sus was determined by gas chromatography an external calibration method with an internal standard was used for het and mea utilizing a flame ionization detector while dtz was extracted in diethyl ether and quantified on a gc ms using a similar quantitation methodology for the cod measurements the spectroquant cell tests were used in duplicate for all samples the total carbon tc and total inorganic carbon tic were determined on an analytikjena multi n c 2100s analyzer and were used for the calculation of total organic carbon toc selected hto effluent samples were qualitatively characterized using solid phase micro extraction spme gc ms to identify organic species remaining after the hto and evaluate their connection to ecotoxicity the hto products at 279 c were extracted with dee and the extract was analyzed with gc ms to quantify a number of pyridines and pyrazines with 2 bromo pyridine used as internal standard in addition to the chemical characterization the density and ph of the sus and the samples after hto were measured 2 4 ecotoxicity of hydrothermally oxidized h2s scavenging wastewater test kits aboatox finland were used for quantification of decrease in bacterial luminescence following the iso 11348 3 standard with modifications iso 2007 freeze dried bacteria aliivibrio fischeri formerly vibrio fischeri were reconstituted in 12 ml saltwater solution 2 wt and left for 20 min before the experiment was initiated five test concentrations were prepared from the stock solution of the sus diluted and undiluted and from each of the hto samples obtained at the different reaction temperatures 199 279 and 350 c and reaction times 5 360 min by dilution with the 2 saltwater solution resulting in a salinity between 2 0 and 3 5 the salinity was measured using a conductivity meter cond 315i wtw xylem analytics germany the exposure concentrations for the diluted sus feed were 0 05 0 25 0 5 2 5 and 5 v v

measuring vials at a concentration corresponding to twice the test concentration to allow for dilution with the reconstituted bacteria solution the background luminescence of the 2 saltwater solution was corrected for by measuring 200 µl of the solution in 2 ml glass vials thermo fisher scientifictm initial bacterial luminescence was measured by pipetting 100 µl of bacteria solution into 2 ml glass vials thermo fisher scientifictm and immediately measuring the luminescence using a luminometer luminoskan tl plus thermo labsystems denoting the luminescence at time 0 following the luminescence measurement 100 µl of the double concentrated test solution was added to the bacteria solution yielding the final test concentrations i e 0 05 5 v v for the diluted sus 0 01 to 1 for the undiluted sus and 0 25 4 v v for the hto effluent samples the experiment was carried out with duplicates for each tested concentration and the controls luminescence measurements were repeated after 15 min and 30 min the tests were considered valid if the parallel determination of the controls did not deviate more than 3 and 30 min exposure to 3 4 mg l of 3 5 dichlorophenol caused between 20 and 80 decrease in luminescence a correction factor fkt was calculated for control solutions according to iso 11348 3 to determine the water dependent decrease in luminescence eq 1 and for the test to be valid the correction factor should be between 0 6 and 1 8 iso 2007 1 f kt i kt i 0 where fkt is the correction factor at time t 15 min or 30 min ikt is the luminescence at time t 15 min or 30 min and

statistical software r loaded with the drc package and used to estimate concentration response curves ec values and their corresponding 95 confidence intervals using a log normal function ritz and streibig 2005 the algal growth inhibition test was conducted with marine algae skeletonema pseudocostatum formerly s costatum obtained from the norwegian institute for water research oslo norway niva

enriched with nutrients following iso 10253 iso 2016 the medium was continuously bubbled with atmospheric air to avoid sedimentation of the algae and to allow for co2 transfer to the aqueous phase the bottles were illuminated from the side with fluorescent tubes 30w 33 philips amsterdam the netherlands with an intensity of 63 µmol m 2 s 1 2 µmol m 2 s 1 measured by li 189 quantum radiometer

phaeodactylum tricornutum iso 2016 a range of test concentrations was prepared from stock solutions from the three reaction temperatures 199 c 279 c and 350 c and the reaction times 5 360 min diluted in iso 10253 algal media based on synthetic seawater these were then inoculated with the appropriate amount of exponentially growing algal culture to obtain an initial final density of 2 104 cells ml the cell density was measured by a coulter counter beckman multisizertm 3 indianapolis usa in practice 250 µl of an exponentially growing algal culture of 2 106 cells ml was added to 25 ml of each

turbidity of some hto samples i e 5 10 min at 279 c and 5 40 min at 350 c a preliminary test for shading of light interfering with ecotoxicity was carried out however as the average light path in the media was kept low by testing in 20 ml vials with only 4 ml algal suspension illuminated from below and the relatively high dilution factor used in the setup no interference with ecotoxicity was observed due to shading the concentrations tested for the diluted sus were 0 0125 0 025 0 075 0 125 and 0 25 v v while for the undiluted sus they were 0 001 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 v v the used concentrations for the samples treated with hto were 0 05 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 1 v v for each concentration three replicates were made and six replicates were used for the control group all samples were incubated as described above and validity criteria stated in iso 10253 were met for all tests i e control growth rate of minimum 0 9 day 1 and a maximum change in ph of 1 unit during the 72 h of incubation samples of 0 4 ml were taken at times 0 h and 72 h and extracted with 1 6 ml acetone the algal growth rates were calculated based on the in vitro fluorescence of algal pigments as a surrogate for biomass as described by mayer et al 1997 the fluorescence was 430 nm and 670 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths background fluorescence was corrected by measuring a blank sample containing the medium and acetone to avoid interference with precipitates the supernatant of each sample was gently transferred to a new vial before fluorescence measurement the algal growth rates were calculated assuming exponential growth following eq 3 3 μ ln n n ln n 0 t d where µ is the growth rate d 1 n0 is the initial biomass nn is the final biomass and td is the length of the test period d additionally the inhibition was calculated as the growth rate of the control related to the growth rate in each individual exposure following eq 4 4 i i 1 μ i μ c 100 where ii is the percentage inhibition of growth for concentration i and µi is the mean growth rate for concentration i and µc is the mean growth rate for the control growth inhibition based on growth rates was plotted in the statistical software r loaded with the drc package and used to estimate concentration response curves ec values and their corresponding 95 confidence intervals using a log normal function ritz and streibig 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the spent and unspent scavengers the physicochemical properties of the as received sus i e undiluted are reported in table 1 the cod and toc values are around 25 30 higher than the values of the spent and unspent h2s scavengers collected in a previous sampling campaign from the same offshore installation montesantos et al 2022 this reflects the variability in the concentration of the organic species in the sus wastewaters at offshore oil and gas production platforms which can be induced by variations of natural gas flowrate and composition over time variations in the mass fraction of het in different batches of the commercial scavenging product as well as by non automatic regulation of the scavenger injection system the concentration of unreacted het is quite high in this sample which indicates a large excess of injected triazine relative to the h2s content in the natural gas in the period preceding the wastewater sampling the sus sample has a slightly higher density and ph compared to the values of the previous sus sample i e 1049 kg m3 vs 1042 kg m3 and ph 9 4 vs 8 9 which is in line with a higher mass fraction of unreacted het the ecotoxicity of the sus is significant as very low concentrations of sus resulted in 50 inhibition ec50 for the tested bacteria and algae in fact the two ec50 values shown in table 1 indicate that when the sus sample was diluted 4167 or 23256 times it still inhibited 50 of the bacterial luminescence and algal growth respectively this is markedly higher than the average dilution required for produced water streams originating from 25 platforms in the north sea to reach 50 inhibition i e 14 times dilution for algae and 9 1 times dilution for bacteria de vries and jak 2018 3 2 removal of cod and toc in fig 1 a and fig 1b the cod and toc reduction is reported respectively as a function of the reaction time the cod0 was calculated to 61 g kg 2 g kg and the toc0 to 17 g kg 1 g kg using the measured cod of the undiluted sus in table 1 and the approximately fivefold dilution in the hto experiments described in section 2 2 overall a significant reduction of both cod and toc is observed for all reaction temperatures as can be seen from fig 1 for both the cod and toc removal a marked difference in the rate of removal of cod and toc can be observed between the reactions at 199 c and the reactions at the higher temperature levels this is in line with previous observations regarding the reaction rate constant at 350 c being 70 times higher than at 200 c montesantos et al 2022 on the other hand the difference between the reactions at 279 c and 350 c is not apparent an additional observation is that most of the toc and cod at the higher temperatures i e 279 c and 350 c was removed during the first 5 10 min of the treatments finally the experiments at 350 c and 360 min not shown in fig 1 for visual convenience show that in this set of experiments a residual cod 6 g kg and toc 3 g kg remains even after long reaction times while this could be interpreted as a presence of recalcitrant organic compounds it is most likely caused by the chemical reactions slowing down substantially due to the depletion of oxygen in the reactor to confirm this hypothesis an experiment was performed at 350 c with a reaction time of 40 min and with an amount of oxygen being 280 of cod0 this resulted in residual concentrations of 0 5 g kg cod and 0 4 g kg toc which were 13 and 10 times lower than the corresponding values for the experiments shown in fig 1 which were obtained with an amount of oxygen being 136 of cod0 these improved reductions are in line with previously published data and clearly show that the process at high temperature when given enough time and oxygen can proceed to almost complete cod and toc removal montesantos et al 2022 however it is observed that the extent of excess of oxygen influences the reaction kinetics as the rate of oxidation changes if 36 or 180 o2 excess is used to assess the state of oxidation the literature suggests combining the toc and cod in ways that can provide information about the removal of cod due to partial or complete oxidation jochimsen and jekel 1997 mantzavinos et al 2000 the fraction of the total cod removal caused by partial oxidation reactions can be visualized by using eq 5 5 ε co d 0 toc to c 0 cod co d 0 cod where cod0 and cod are the chemical oxygen demands at the initial time and at the generic time respectively while toc0 and toc are the analogous quantities for the total organic carbon the calculated ε values for the three reaction temperatures and the reaction time range 5 40 min are reported in fig 2 as can be seen from figs 1 and 2 for the lower temperature 199 c the cod removal is limited and mainly due to partial oxidation reactions of the feed compounds to intermediates and products while the toc is not significantly reduced at the two higher temperatures the cod is mainly removed by complete mineralization of the sus constituents ε values between 0 1 and 0 3 which implies the formation of co2 h2o n2 and inorganic salts i e so4 2 and nh4 montesantos et al 2022 3 3 chemical composition of the hydrothermal oxidation effluent due to the observation of residual cod and toc in the hto samples even at high temperatures and long reaction times i e 350 c and 360 min the chemical composition of the hto effluent was investigated qualitative spme gc ms showed several organic water soluble compounds produced during the reaction including pyrazine pyridine quinoline and some of their alkyl derivatives an example chromatogram of the oxidation products at 350 c and 360 min is reported in fig 3 a with some of the chemical structures corresponding to the major peaks these appear to be intermediate oxidation products of het and dtz as they all contain 1 2 nitrogen atoms while no het dtz or mea were detected in any of the hto effluent samples although the chemical classes identified are in line with the data published by montesantos et al 2022 the number of organic species observed in this work was larger for example fig 3b shows the chromatograms normalized to the peak with the largest height of two hto experiments at 350 c after 40 min with two different o2 levels low 136 of cod0 and high 280 of cod0 in line with the observation regarding cod and toc section 3 2 a lower excess of oxidant leads to a lower extent of the oxidation reactions as reflected by the chromatogram referred to high oxygen excess which is devoid of most peaks the fact that the peak of pyridine is the only significant one remaining even at long times and with high excess of oxygen is an indication that it is a relatively slow reacting n compound in the sus oxidation products however it should be noted that this comparison is qualitative and it was shown in a previous work that at 350 c and high oxygen excess the pyridine can be oxidized down to only a few mg kg montesantos et al 2022 this is reflected by the cod reduction achieved in the two experiments of fig 3b that was 90 and 98 for the low and high o2 excess respectively the latter value is in line with the published data on a different sus indicating that the hto process is not very sensitive towards the initial mass fraction of het mea and dtz montesantos et al 2022 in general hydrothermal oxidation is robust towards moderate concentration changes of the feed even though the monitoring of the cod changes is essential for continuous operation to efficiently control the process and avoid issues like runaway reaction temperatures or unsatisfactory extent of oxidation bhargava et al 2006 3 4 ecotoxicity of spent and unspent h2s scavengers before and after hydrothermal oxidation reference tests with 3 5 dichlorophenol were carried out for s pseudocostatum yielding ec50 of 1 6 mg l 95 confidence interval 0 87 2 3 for a fischeri an exposure to 3 4 mg l 3 5 dichlorophenol for 30 min resulted in a decrease in luminescence by 28 both values were within the expected range for the substance and test organisms according to the international testing guidelines iso 2016 2007 table 2 shows the ecotoxicity of whole samples of hto effluents when tested in standardized bacterial and algal tests the 50 effect concentration ec50 for the diluted sus i e the reactor feed prior to hto was 0 12 0 075 0 16 and 0 022 0 02 0 023 for bacteria and algae respectively fig 4 shows the decrease in ecotoxicity expressed as 1 e c 50 relatively to the value of the ecotoxicity at the initial time of the reaction 1 e c 50 0 while the ec50 data are reported in table 2 as can be seen for the bacteria a reaction time dependent decrease in ecotoxicity is observed for both the low 199 c and medium 279 c reaction temperatures resulting in a complete removal of ecotoxicity within the tested concentration range ec50 20 after 60 min and 40 min of reaction time respectively fig 4a at the highest temperature 350 c a complete removal of ecotoxicity is observed after 20 min of reaction time however increases in ecotoxicity are observed for longer reaction times of 40 min and 360 min resulting in ec50 values of 4 4 3 6 5 3 and 2 2 1 9 2 6 respectively consequently the results suggest that optimizing the hto reaction times around 20 min 40 min and 60 min for high medium and low temperatures respectively would give the highest decrease in ecotoxicity for the bacteria a fischeri the increasing ecotoxicity at longer treatment times does not have a clear explanation but it is probably related to the low unreacted oxygen in the reactor as mentioned previously this is observed by the comparison of the hto experiments performed at 40 min and 350 c with high o2 excess i e 280 of cod0 that resulted in ec50 values of 0 11 and 9 4 for algae and bacteria respectively compared to ec50 values of 0 059 and 3 7 table 2 for the oxidation at the same temperature and reaction time with low oxygen excess i e 136 of cod0 considering literature ec50 data for pyridine and applying the dilution factor required to reach 50 inhibition at the largest mass fraction of pyridine observed at 279 c and 20 min table s2 the measured pyridine only accounts for approximately 4 of the observed effect expressed as toxic units here defined as 100 ec50 liu et al 1998 even when including the toxic units of all chemical parameters nh4 no3 so4 2 formic acid acetic acid succinic acid pyrazines and pyridines in the present and the previous work on hto of sus montesantos et al 2022 the sum of toxic units still accounts for 10 of the observed ecotoxic response the relatively low accountable contribution is common for complex effluents unless the response can be associated with few highly toxic compounds driving the response baun et al 2004 the lack of causality is also highlighted by the decrease in cod fig 1 not directly reflecting the decrease in ecotoxicity fig 4a for the bacteria for example the oxidation at 199 c yields a decrease in cod of 61 after 60 min reaction time while the corresponding decrease in ecotoxicity of the bacteria is complete within the tested concentration range while full chemical characterization of samples is practically unfeasible these results highlight the complementary use of biological and chemical assessment to better understand the response and optimization parameters when working with complex reactive processes and matrices in order not to overlook possible dependencies the algal growth inhibition test showed a reaction time dependent decrease in ecotoxicity for 5 min and 10 min at 199 c resulting in 48 and 64 removal of ecotoxicity here defined as 1 ec50 and reported in fig 4 respectively at reaction times 10 min there was no further statistically significant decrease in ecotoxicity resulting in an average ec50 value for the remaining time points of 0 06 0 003 table 2 a similar trend was observed for the hto at 279 c with a respective ecotoxicity mitigation of 77 and 86 compared to the diluted sus fig 4b after 20 min hto the ecotoxicity increased to levels similar to 10 min reaction at 199 c the increase in ecotoxicity after 20 min could be due to formation of relatively toxic compounds such as formaldehyde caused by triazine degradation and pyridines produced in the partial oxidation process at concentrations which can contribute to growth inhibition of algae at the reaction temperature of 350 c a decrease in ecotoxicity of 75 after 5 min of treatment was observed an apparent increase in ecotoxicity was observed after 10 min following a decrease again after 20 min table 2 and fig 4b a previous work montesantos et al 2022 showed that the mass fraction of pyridines exhibits a local maximum for a reaction time of 10 min at 350 c and this could contribute to the observed local maximum in ecotoxicity beyond 10 min there is a time dependent decrease in ecotoxicity resulting in 82 removal of ecotoxicity after 40 min of treatment after 360 min of treatment there is a 94 increase in ecotoxicity compared to the 40 min treatment which has no clear explanation and may be connected to undesirable non oxidation hydrothermal reactions occurring due to the low residual amount of oxygen in the reactor the abovementioned effect of the excess of oxygen was tested for the experiments at 350 c and 40 min for both bacteria and algae leading to a 61 and 46 reduction of ecotoxicity respectively for the high o2 excess 280 of cod0 experiment compared to the low o2 excess 136 of cod0 it has to be remarked that though there is a clear reduction of ecotoxicity compared to the feed in all cases the local variations after 10 min of reaction times are not always statistically significant when considering 95 confidence intervals the trends of the ecotoxicity during the first five minutes of reaction however qualitatively aligns with the variations of the chemical parameters cod toc exhibiting marked decreases in both cases independently of reaction time and temperature the algal test showed higher sensitivity than the bacterial test in general the chronic endpoint of the algae is more susceptible to be impacted by compositional changes in the media than the acute response of the bacteria consequently the matrix itself has a lower threshold for a response to occur which could result in small variations in e g pyridine to be expressed as a response this type of effects is rather difficult to quantify with a relatively high complex interaction between the chemical composition and biological response therefore it is important to stress that the approaches chemical and biological should be used in a complementary way for better optimization of the process parameters such as the reaction time the reaction temperature and the o2 supply however it is key to highlight that chemical parameters such as cod and toc are inherently contributing to the environmental impact thus a reduction of those is in itself beneficial the two species used in this study should only be used as indicators for relative decreases in ecotoxicity and results of these tests do not necessarily reflect effects in the marine environment thus for further assessment of the environmental impact in terms of marine ecotoxicity a broader range of tests and organisms is required preferably covering mutagenicity and chronic endpoints inferring ecotoxicity from standard chemical parameters e g cod toc should be done with caution as shown in this study while large cod toc reductions generally correspond to ecotoxicity reductions when observing the data in further detail it can be seen that the ecotoxicity trends may present remarkable differences from the trends in cod and toc which can lead to different choices for the optimal design parameters for the reactor additionally unless highly toxic components are present in the samples chemical analysis will be insufficient to fully describe the ecotoxic effect of a relatively complex mixture such as the sus and its hto products in such cases the complementary use of specific chemical analyses and ecotoxicity testing of whole samples is recommended 4 conclusions this study shows that hydrothermal oxidation significantly reduces the environmental impact of spent unspent h2s scavengers sus based on large cod and toc reductions together with reduction of ecotoxicity on two test species specifically the ecotoxicity towards bacteria aliivibrio fischeri was reduced for all reaction conditions by more than 90 compared to the reactor feed i e diluted sus and reached full mitigation within the tested concentration range for reaction times in the range 20 to 60 min with optimal reactions times decreasing with the reaction temperature in addition the ecotoxicity reduction using algae skeletonema pseudocostatum as test organisms was found to range between 48 66 59 86 and 60 82 for the oxidation reaction temperatures of 199 c 279 c and 350 c respectively furthermore this work shows that the identification of optimal process parameters e g temperature oxygen supply reaction time for the design of the hydrothermal oxidation process should be based on a combination of chemical e g cod and ecotoxicity analysis on multiple organisms rather than based on cod only these results provide offshore oil and gas operators with a solid foundation for designing the hydrothermal oxidation process as an on site treatment method for the sus wastewater before discharge and for optimizing operational parameters to reduce ecotoxicity in addition this work opens further research towards better understanding of the compositional effects of sus wastewaters as well as introducing the

15149,the discharge of h2s scavenging wastewaters containing spent and unspent scavengers sus into the marine environment is a large contributor to the environmental impact of offshore oil and gas production hydrothermal oxidation hto can be a viable method for on site treatment of the sus before discharge but the effect of the process on the ecotoxicity of the effluent has not been investigated so far the aim of this study was to investigate the potential of the hto technology in reducing the environmental impact by linking the chemical process design with ecotoxicity reduction for this we combined hto experiments on a sus sample from an oil and gas platform in the north sea with whole effluent ecotoxicity evaluation before and after the treatment the hto process was carried out under excess of oxygen for temperatures and pressures in the range 199 to 350 c and 83 to 228 bar respectively and for reaction times of 5 to 360 min initially the sus sample exhibited very high ecotoxicity which was drastically reduced by the hto process more specifically the ecotoxicity towards bacteria was reduced more than 90 for all hto conditions while the reduction in algal toxicity was in the range 48 to 66 59 to 86 and 60 to 82 at reaction temperatures of 199 c 279 c and 350 c respectively furthermore this work shows how typical wastewater chemical analyses such as cod and toc and ecotoxicity tests towards different organisms provide complementary information which should be used in combination to optimize operating conditions of the hto process graphical abstract image

introduction produced water from offshore oil and gas production is one of the largest industrial direct discharges into the marine environment estimated to 324 million m3 annually in the north sea karman and smit 2019 neff et al 2011 scholten et al 2000 while the discharge has been associated with detrimental effects on the environment it is a relative dilute stream and diverse in terms of chemical composition hence difficult to treat alternatively to reduce the overall environmental impact smaller and more concentrated streams can be identified in offshore oil and gas production and treated prior to discharge an example of such a stream is the wastewater from the h2s scavenging of natural gas that results from the injection of aqueous h2s scavengers aiming to convert the highly toxic and corrosive h2s to less harmful compounds kelland 2014 the h2s scavenger is typically based on 1 3 5 hexahydrotriazines henceforth triazines that are widely used in the field and particularly water soluble variants such as 1 3 5 tri 2 hydroxyethyl hexahydro s triazine het also known as mea triazine kelland 2014 taylor et al 2019 since het is typically injected in stoichiometric excess with respect to h2s it ends up partly unreacted unspent scavenger together with the reaction products spent scavengers in the wastewater stream that is separated from the natural gas kelland 2014 montesantos et al 2022 in line with the reaction scheme generally accepted in the literature the main scavenging reaction products that appear in the spent scavenger wastewater are monoethanolamine mea and 5 2 hydroxyethyl hexahydro 1 3 5 dithiazine dtz bakke et al 2001 romero et al 2021 taylor and matherly 2010 the injection formulation also contains trace amounts of formaldehyde which is one of the reactants used for het synthesis kelland 2014 while the h2s scavenging reaction reduces the operational and occupational challenges associated with h2s the environmental impact of the discharge is high due to persistency and ecotoxicity of the associated compounds in fact it has been reported that the discharge associated to h2s scavenging contribute up to 20 of the overall environmental impact factor eif of north sea offshore platforms reed and rye 2011 stipanicev et al 2018 in some installations of the north sea it was estimated that this discharge contributes for more than 10 of the total eif while being less than 0 1 in volume of the total produced water consequently it is apparent that the treatment of this relatively small but highly concentrated stream can conveniently provide a significant decrease in the overall environmental impact of discharges associated with offshore oil and gas production hydrothermal oxidation hto of the spent unspent scavenger sus prior to discharge has recently been suggested as an efficient way to reduce the environmental impact of offshore discharge montesantos et al 2022 subcritical i e 150 320 c hto using air as oxidant referred industrially as wet air oxidation is commonly used to remove organic pollutants in different industrial wastewater streams with moderate to high chemical oxygen demand 20 200 g l cod yousefifar et al 2017 this process is commonly applied prior to biological treatment to reduce the wastewater toxicity kolaczkowski et al 1999 hto has minimal energy requirements since after start up it can be autothermally sustained due to the exothermic oxidation reactions that produce enough heat when the cod exceeds 12 15 g l debellefontaine and foussard 2000 in our laboratory activities in connection with offshore oil and gas operations we have measured values of cod for the sus in the range 120 to 320 g l i e well above the threshold for ensuring an autothermal process montesantos et al 2022 provided a proof of concept of the hto process by testing the technology on a sus sample at low 200 c and high temperature 350 c a substantial reduction of cod was observed with more than 50 reduction after 40 min at 200 c while at 350 c 85 of cod was removed in 10 min the possibility of attaining large cod reductions at low reaction times and the relatively low flow rates of the sus stream suggested the feasibility of a small volume hto unit to be installed offshore where low footprint and low weight are important constraints while the removal of cod was pronounced an extensive analysis of the reaction products revealed c1 c4 carboxylic acids up to 1 5 g kg and small amounts of pyridines and pyrazines up to 330 mg kg in the hto effluent since the target of the on site hto treatment is to drastically reduce the environmental impact of the sus wastewater discharge it is deemed necessary to combine the chemical characterization e g cod to ecotoxicity tests to evaluate the effect of the discharge on the aquatic environment and to link it with the operating parameters of the hto process thus the aim of this work is to assess the efficiency of hto in reducing the ecotoxicity of the sus and to provide a combined basis i e chemical and ecotoxicological for process design the hto study was performed at three temperature levels 199 c 279 c and 350 c and for reaction times ranging from 5 to 360 min the ecotoxicity was assessed using two different species in standardized test setups covering acute toxicity using luminescence decrease of bacteria aliivibrio fischeri after 15 and 30 min of exposure and acute chronic toxicity using growth inhibition of marine algae skeletonema pseudocostatum after 72 h of exposure 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the sus was retrieved from an offshore oil and gas production platform in the north sea the sample was collected downstream of two gas and water separators delivered to our laboratory in june 2021 and stored at 4 c the hto

temperature hpht reactor following a procedure described in detail in a previous work montesantos et al 2022 in short approximately 20 g of deionized water was precharged into the reactor vessel and after the vessel was sealed it was purged and pressurized to 35 bar with o2 the o2 pressure was selected to ensure that for all experiments the available o2 was equal or higher than the initial cod i e cod0 in the reactor i e 106 145 of cod0 consequently the reactor was heated to the selected reaction temperature and when that temperature was reached approximately 30 g of prediluted approximately twofold dilution with demineralized water sus was injected to the reactor the cod0 in the reactor was calculated considering the predilution prior to the injection as well as the further dilution in the reactor due to the precharged water henceforth the diluted sus i e approximately fivefold dilution is considered the feed of the hto reactions in total 21 hto experiments were performed at 3 temperatures 199 c 1 c 279 c 1 c 350 c 2 c and 4 5 reaction times 5 360 min the reaction pressures were 88 bar 1 bar 124 bar 7 bar and 215 bar 8 bar for the reactions at 199 c 279 c and 350 c respectively to verify reproducibility duplicate experiments were performed at 199 c and 40 min 279 c and 10 min 350 c and 10 min as well as 360 min while the experiments at 350 c and 40 min were performed in triplicate when the reaction time was elapsed the reaction products were ejected through a tap water cooled condenser into a cold dry trap gas washing bottle immersed in ice and water and the collected aqueous effluent was used for analytical characterization and ecotoxicity tests the reaction conditions for all the experiments are reported in table s1 in the supplementary information 2 3 analytical characterization the analytical characterization of the sus and the hto effluent samples was performed utilizing the methodologies reported in a previous work montesantos et al 2022 in short the composition of the sus was determined by gas chromatography an external calibration method with an internal standard was used for het and mea utilizing a flame ionization detector while dtz was extracted in diethyl ether and quantified on a gc ms using a similar quantitation methodology for the cod measurements the spectroquant cell tests were used in duplicate for all samples the total carbon tc and total inorganic carbon tic were determined on an analytikjena multi n c 2100s analyzer and were used for the calculation of total organic carbon toc selected hto effluent samples were qualitatively characterized using solid phase micro extraction spme gc ms to identify organic species remaining after the hto and evaluate their connection to ecotoxicity the hto products at 279 c were extracted with dee and the extract was analyzed with gc ms to quantify a number of pyridines and pyrazines with 2 bromo pyridine used as internal standard in addition to the chemical characterization the density and ph of the sus and the samples after hto were measured 2 4 ecotoxicity of hydrothermally oxidized h2s scavenging wastewater test kits aboatox finland were used for quantification of decrease in bacterial luminescence following the iso 11348 3 standard with modifications iso 2007 freeze dried bacteria aliivibrio fischeri formerly vibrio fischeri were reconstituted in 12 ml saltwater solution 2 wt and left for 20 min before the experiment was initiated five test concentrations were prepared from the stock solution of the sus diluted and undiluted and from each of the hto samples obtained at the different reaction temperatures 199 279 and 350 c and reaction times 5 360 min by dilution with the 2 saltwater solution resulting in a salinity between 2 0 and 3 5 the salinity was measured using a conductivity meter cond 315i wtw xylem analytics germany the exposure concentrations for the diluted sus feed were 0 05 0 25 0 5 2 5 and 5 v v while for the undiluted sus they were 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 5 and 1 v v the used concentrations for the samples treated with hto were 0 25 0 5 1 2 and 4 v v the stock solutions were prepared in 10 ml measuring vials at a concentration corresponding to twice the test concentration to allow for dilution with the reconstituted bacteria solution the background luminescence of the 2 saltwater solution was corrected for by measuring 200 µl of the solution in 2 ml glass vials thermo fisher scientifictm initial bacterial luminescence was measured by pipetting 100 µl of bacteria solution into 2 ml glass vials thermo fisher scientifictm and immediately measuring the luminescence using a luminometer luminoskan tl plus thermo labsystems denoting the luminescence at time 0 following the luminescence measurement 100 µl of the double concentrated test solution was added to the bacteria solution yielding the final test concentrations i e 0 05 5 v v for the diluted sus 0 01 to 1 for the undiluted sus and 0 25 4 v v for the hto effluent samples the experiment was carried out with duplicates for each tested concentration and the controls luminescence measurements were repeated after 15 min and 30 min the tests were considered valid if the parallel determination of the controls did not deviate more than 3 and 30 min exposure to 3 4 mg l of 3 5 dichlorophenol caused between 20 and 80 decrease in luminescence a correction factor fkt was calculated for control solutions according to iso 11348 3 to determine the water dependent decrease in luminescence eq 1 and for the test to be valid the correction factor should be between 0 6 and 1 8 iso 2007 1 f kt i kt i 0 where fkt is the correction factor at time t 15 min or 30 min ikt is the luminescence at time t 15 min or 30 min and

streibig 2005 the algal growth inhibition test was conducted with marine algae skeletonema pseudocostatum formerly s costatum obtained from the norwegian institute for water research oslo norway niva bac 1 it was grown continuously in 100 ml bluecap bottles containing filtered pore size 0 45 µm whatman merck life science natural seawater obtained from dtu aqua technical university of denmark enriched with nutrients following iso 10253 iso 2016 the medium was continuously bubbled with atmospheric air to avoid sedimentation of the algae and to allow for co2 transfer to the aqueous phase the bottles were illuminated from the side with fluorescent tubes 30w 33 philips amsterdam the netherlands with an intensity of 63 µmol m 2 s 1 2 µmol m 2 s 1 measured by li 189 quantum radiometer photometer li cor nebraska usa at a temperature of 20 c 2 c the 72 h tests were conducted with modifications of the iso 10253 standard for marine algal growth inhibition test with skeletonema sp and phaeodactylum tricornutum iso 2016 a range of test concentrations was prepared from stock solutions from the three reaction temperatures 199 c 279 c and 350 c and the reaction times 5 360 min diluted in iso 10253 algal media based on synthetic seawater these were then inoculated with the appropriate amount of exponentially growing algal culture to obtain an initial final density of 2 104 cells ml the cell density was measured by a coulter counter beckman multisizertm 3 indianapolis usa in practice 250 µl of an exponentially growing algal culture of 2 106 cells ml was added to 25 ml of each exposure concentration and 4 ml was transferred to 20 ml scintillation vials n 3 and placed on an orbital shaker ika schüttler mts 4 mounted with a rack and continuously illuminated from below with

turbidity of some hto samples i e 5 10 min at 279 c and 5 40 min at 350 c a preliminary test for shading of light interfering with ecotoxicity was carried out however as the average light path in the media was kept low by testing in 20 ml vials with only 4 ml algal suspension illuminated from below and the relatively high dilution factor used in the setup no interference with ecotoxicity was observed due to shading the concentrations tested for the diluted sus were 0 0125 0 025 0 075 0 125 and 0 25 v v while for the undiluted sus they were 0 001 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 v v the used concentrations for the samples treated with hto were 0 05 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 1 v v for each concentration three replicates were made and six replicates were used for the control group all samples were incubated as described above and validity criteria stated in iso 10253 were met for all tests i e control growth rate of minimum 0 9 day 1 and a maximum change in ph of 1 unit during the 72 h of incubation samples of 0 4 ml were taken at times 0 h and 72 h and extracted with 1 6 ml acetone the algal growth rates were calculated based on the in vitro fluorescence of algal pigments as a surrogate for biomass as described by mayer et al 1997 the fluorescence was 430 nm and 670 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths background fluorescence was corrected by measuring a blank sample containing the medium and acetone to avoid interference with precipitates the supernatant of each sample was gently transferred to a new vial before fluorescence measurement the algal growth rates were calculated assuming exponential growth following eq 3 3 μ ln n n ln n 0 t d where µ is the growth rate d 1 n0 is the initial biomass nn is the final biomass and td is the length of the test period d additionally the inhibition was calculated as the growth rate of the control related to the growth rate in each individual exposure following eq 4 4 i i 1 μ i μ c 100 where ii is the percentage inhibition of growth for concentration i and µi is the mean growth rate for concentration i and µc is the mean growth rate for the control growth inhibition based on growth rates was plotted in the statistical software r loaded with the drc package and used to estimate concentration response curves ec values and their corresponding 95 confidence intervals using a log normal function ritz and streibig 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the spent and unspent scavengers the physicochemical properties of the as received sus i e undiluted are reported in table 1 the cod and toc values are around 25 30 higher than the values of the spent and unspent h2s scavengers collected in a previous sampling campaign from the same offshore installation montesantos et al 2022 this reflects the variability in the concentration of the organic species in the sus wastewaters at offshore oil and gas production platforms which can be induced by variations of natural gas flowrate and composition over time variations in the mass fraction of het in different batches of the commercial scavenging product as well as by non automatic regulation of the scavenger injection system the concentration of unreacted het is quite high in this sample which indicates a large excess of injected triazine relative to the h2s content in the natural gas in the period preceding the wastewater sampling the sus sample has a slightly higher density and ph compared to the values of the previous sus sample i e 1049 kg m3 vs 1042 kg m3 and ph 9 4 vs 8 9 which is in line with a higher mass fraction of unreacted het the ecotoxicity of the sus is significant as very low concentrations of sus resulted in 50 inhibition ec50 for the tested bacteria and algae in fact the two ec50 values shown in table 1 indicate that when the sus sample was diluted 4167 or 23256 times it still inhibited 50 of the bacterial luminescence and algal growth respectively this is markedly higher than the average dilution required for produced water streams originating from 25 platforms in the north sea to reach 50 inhibition i e 14 times dilution for algae and 9 1 times dilution for bacteria de vries and jak 2018 3 2 removal of cod and toc in fig 1 a and fig 1b the cod and toc reduction is reported respectively as a function of the reaction time the cod0 was calculated to 61 g kg 2 g kg and the toc0 to 17 g kg 1 g kg using the measured cod of the undiluted sus in table 1 and the approximately fivefold dilution in the hto experiments described in section 2 2 overall a significant reduction of both cod and toc is observed for all reaction temperatures as can be seen from fig 1 for both the cod and toc removal a marked difference in the rate of removal of cod and toc can be observed between the reactions at 199 c and the reactions at the higher temperature levels this is in line with previous observations regarding the reaction rate constant at 350 c being 70 times higher than at 200 c montesantos et al 2022 on the other hand the difference between the reactions at 279 c and 350 c is not apparent an additional observation is that most of the toc and cod at the higher temperatures i e 279 c and 350 c was removed during the first 5 10 min of the treatments finally the experiments at 350 c and 360 min not shown in fig 1 for visual convenience show that in this set of experiments a residual cod 6 g kg and toc 3 g kg remains even after long reaction times while this could be interpreted as a presence of recalcitrant organic compounds it is most likely caused by the chemical reactions slowing down substantially due to the depletion of oxygen in the reactor to confirm this hypothesis an experiment was performed at 350 c with a reaction time of 40 min and with an amount of oxygen being 280 of cod0 this resulted in residual concentrations of 0 5 g kg cod and 0 4 g kg toc which were 13 and 10 times lower than the corresponding values for the experiments shown in fig 1 which were obtained with an amount of oxygen being 136 of cod0 these improved reductions are in line with previously published data and clearly show that the process at high temperature when given enough time and oxygen can proceed to almost complete cod and toc removal montesantos et al 2022 however it is observed that the extent of excess of oxygen influences the reaction kinetics as the rate of oxidation changes if 36 or 180 o2 excess is used to assess the state of oxidation the literature suggests combining the toc and cod in ways that can provide information about the removal of cod due to partial or complete oxidation jochimsen and jekel 1997 mantzavinos et al 2000 the fraction of the total cod removal caused by partial oxidation reactions can be visualized by using eq 5 5 ε co d 0 toc to c 0 cod co d 0 cod where cod0 and cod are the chemical oxygen demands at the initial time and at the generic time respectively while toc0 and toc are the analogous quantities for the total organic carbon the calculated ε values for the three reaction temperatures and the reaction time range 5 40 min are reported in fig 2 as can be seen from figs 1 and 2 for the lower temperature 199 c the cod removal is limited and mainly due to partial oxidation reactions of the feed compounds to intermediates and products while the toc is not significantly reduced at the two higher temperatures the cod is mainly removed by complete mineralization of the sus constituents ε values between 0 1 and 0 3 which implies the formation of co2 h2o n2 and inorganic salts i e so4 2 and nh4 montesantos et al 2022 3 3 chemical composition of the hydrothermal oxidation effluent due to the observation of residual cod and toc in the hto samples even at high temperatures and long reaction times i e 350 c and 360 min the chemical composition of the hto effluent was investigated qualitative spme gc ms showed several organic water soluble compounds produced during the reaction including pyrazine pyridine quinoline and some of their alkyl derivatives an example chromatogram of the oxidation products at 350 c and 360 min is reported in fig 3 a with some of the chemical structures corresponding to the major peaks these appear to be intermediate oxidation products of het and dtz as they all contain 1 2 nitrogen atoms while no het dtz or mea were detected in any of the hto effluent samples although the chemical classes identified are in line with the data published by montesantos et al 2022 the number of organic species observed in this work was larger for example fig 3b shows the chromatograms normalized to the peak with the largest height of two hto experiments at 350 c after 40 min with two different o2 levels low 136 of cod0 and high 280 of cod0 in line with the observation regarding cod and toc section 3 2 a lower excess of oxidant leads to a lower extent of the oxidation reactions as reflected by the chromatogram referred to high oxygen excess which is devoid of most peaks the fact that the peak of pyridine is the only significant one remaining even at long times and with high excess of oxygen is an indication that it is a relatively slow reacting n compound in the sus oxidation products however it should be noted that this comparison is qualitative and it was shown in a previous work that at 350 c and high oxygen excess the pyridine can be oxidized down to only a few mg kg montesantos et al 2022 this is reflected by the cod reduction achieved in the two experiments of fig 3b that was 90 and 98 for the low and high o2 excess respectively the latter value is in line with the published data on a different sus indicating that the hto process is not very sensitive towards the initial mass fraction of het mea and dtz montesantos et al 2022 in general hydrothermal oxidation is robust towards moderate concentration changes of the feed even though the monitoring of the cod changes is essential for continuous operation to efficiently control the process and avoid issues like runaway reaction temperatures or unsatisfactory extent of oxidation bhargava et al 2006 3 4 ecotoxicity of spent and unspent h2s scavengers before and after hydrothermal oxidation reference tests with 3 5 dichlorophenol were carried out for s pseudocostatum yielding ec50 of 1 6 mg l 95 confidence interval 0 87 2 3 for a fischeri an exposure to 3 4 mg l 3 5 dichlorophenol for 30 min resulted in a decrease in luminescence by 28 both values were within the expected range for the substance and test organisms according to the international testing guidelines iso 2016 2007 table 2 shows the ecotoxicity of whole samples of hto effluents when tested in standardized bacterial and algal tests the 50 effect concentration ec50 for the diluted sus i e the reactor feed prior to hto was 0 12 0 075 0 16 and 0 022 0 02 0 023 for bacteria and algae respectively fig 4 shows the decrease in ecotoxicity expressed as 1 e c 50 relatively to the value of the ecotoxicity at the initial time of the reaction 1 e c 50 0 while the ec50 data are reported in table 2 as can be seen for the bacteria a reaction time dependent decrease in ecotoxicity is observed for both the low 199 c and medium 279 c reaction temperatures resulting in a complete removal of ecotoxicity within the tested concentration range ec50 20 after 60 min and 40 min of reaction time respectively fig 4a at the highest temperature 350 c a complete removal of ecotoxicity is observed after 20 min of reaction time however increases in ecotoxicity are observed for longer reaction times of 40 min and 360 min resulting in ec50 values of 4 4 3 6 5 3 and 2 2 1 9 2 6 respectively consequently the results suggest that optimizing the hto reaction times around 20 min 40 min and 60 min for high medium and low temperatures respectively would give the highest decrease in ecotoxicity for the bacteria a fischeri the increasing ecotoxicity at longer treatment times does not have a clear explanation but it is probably related to the low unreacted oxygen in the reactor as mentioned previously this is observed by the comparison of the hto experiments performed at 40 min and 350 c with high o2 excess i e 280 of cod0 that resulted in ec50 values of 0 11 and 9 4 for algae and bacteria respectively compared to ec50 values of 0 059 and 3 7 table 2 for the oxidation at the same temperature and reaction time with low oxygen excess i e 136 of cod0 considering literature ec50 data for pyridine and applying the dilution factor required to reach 50 inhibition at the largest mass fraction of pyridine observed at 279 c and 20 min table s2 the measured pyridine only accounts for approximately 4 of the observed effect expressed as toxic units here defined as 100 ec50 liu et al 1998 even when including the toxic units of all chemical parameters nh4 no3 so4 2 formic acid acetic acid succinic acid pyrazines and pyridines in the present and the previous work on hto of sus montesantos et al 2022 the sum of toxic units still accounts for 10 of the observed ecotoxic response the relatively low accountable contribution is common for complex effluents unless the response can be associated with few highly toxic compounds driving the response baun et al 2004 the lack of causality is also highlighted by the decrease in cod fig 1 not directly reflecting the decrease in ecotoxicity fig 4a for the bacteria for example the oxidation at 199 c yields a decrease in cod of 61 after 60 min reaction time while the corresponding decrease in ecotoxicity of the bacteria is complete within the tested concentration range while full chemical characterization of samples is practically unfeasible these results highlight the complementary use of biological and chemical assessment to better understand the response and optimization parameters when working with complex reactive processes and matrices in order not to overlook possible dependencies the algal growth inhibition test showed a reaction time dependent decrease in ecotoxicity for 5 min and 10 min at 199 c resulting in 48 and 64 removal of ecotoxicity here defined as 1 ec50 and reported in fig 4 respectively at reaction times 10 min there was no further statistically significant decrease in ecotoxicity resulting in an average ec50 value for the remaining time points of 0 06 0 003 table 2 a similar trend was observed for the hto at 279 c with a respective ecotoxicity mitigation of 77 and 86 compared to the diluted sus fig 4b after 20 min hto the ecotoxicity increased to levels similar to 10 min reaction at 199 c the increase in ecotoxicity after 20 min could be due to formation of relatively toxic compounds such as formaldehyde caused by triazine degradation and pyridines produced in the partial oxidation process at concentrations which can contribute to growth inhibition of algae at the reaction temperature of 350 c a decrease in ecotoxicity of 75 after 5 min of treatment was observed an apparent increase in ecotoxicity was observed after 10 min following a decrease again after 20 min table 2 and fig 4b a previous work montesantos et al 2022 showed that the mass fraction of pyridines exhibits a local maximum for a reaction time of 10 min at 350 c and this could contribute to the observed local maximum in ecotoxicity beyond 10 min there is a time dependent decrease in ecotoxicity resulting in 82 removal of ecotoxicity after 40 min of treatment after 360 min of treatment there is a 94 increase in ecotoxicity compared to the 40 min treatment which has no clear explanation and may be connected to undesirable non oxidation hydrothermal reactions occurring due to the low residual amount of oxygen in the reactor the abovementioned effect of the excess of oxygen was tested for the experiments at 350 c and 40 min for both bacteria and algae leading to a 61 and 46 reduction of ecotoxicity respectively for the high o2 excess 280 of cod0 experiment compared to the low o2 excess 136 of cod0 it has to be remarked that though there is a clear reduction of ecotoxicity compared to the feed in all cases the local variations after 10 min of reaction times are not always statistically significant when considering 95 confidence intervals the trends of the ecotoxicity during the first five minutes of reaction however qualitatively aligns with the variations of the chemical parameters cod toc exhibiting marked decreases in both cases independently of reaction time and temperature the algal test showed higher sensitivity than the bacterial test in general the chronic endpoint of the algae is more susceptible to be impacted by compositional changes in the media than the acute response of the bacteria consequently the matrix itself has a lower threshold for a response to occur which could result in small variations in e g pyridine to be expressed as a response this type of effects is rather difficult to quantify with a relatively high complex interaction between the chemical composition and biological response therefore it is important to stress that the approaches chemical and biological should be used in a complementary way for better optimization of the process parameters such as the reaction time the reaction temperature and the o2 supply however it is key to highlight that chemical parameters such as cod and toc are inherently contributing to the environmental impact thus a reduction of those is in itself beneficial the two species used in this study should only be used as indicators for relative decreases in ecotoxicity and results of these tests do not necessarily reflect effects in the marine environment thus for further assessment of the environmental impact in terms of marine ecotoxicity a broader range of tests and organisms is required preferably covering mutagenicity and chronic endpoints inferring ecotoxicity from standard chemical parameters e g cod toc should be done with caution as shown in this study while large cod toc reductions generally correspond to ecotoxicity reductions when observing the data in further detail it can be seen that the ecotoxicity trends may present remarkable differences from the trends in cod and toc which can lead to different choices for the optimal design parameters for the reactor additionally unless highly toxic components are present in the samples chemical analysis will be insufficient to fully describe the ecotoxic effect of a relatively complex mixture such as the sus and its hto products in such cases the complementary use of specific chemical analyses and ecotoxicity testing of whole samples is recommended 4 conclusions this study shows that hydrothermal oxidation significantly reduces the environmental impact of spent unspent h2s scavengers sus based on large cod and toc reductions together with reduction of ecotoxicity on two test species specifically the ecotoxicity towards bacteria aliivibrio fischeri was reduced for all reaction conditions by more than 90 compared to the reactor feed i e diluted sus and reached full mitigation within the tested concentration range for reaction times in the range 20 to 60 min with optimal reactions times decreasing with the reaction temperature in addition the ecotoxicity reduction using algae skeletonema pseudocostatum as test organisms was found to range between 48 66 59 86 and 60 82 for the oxidation reaction temperatures of 199 c 279 c and 350 c respectively furthermore this work shows that the identification of optimal process parameters e g temperature oxygen supply reaction time for the design of the hydrothermal oxidation process should be based on a combination of chemical e g cod and ecotoxicity analysis on multiple organisms rather than based on cod only these results provide offshore oil and gas operators with a solid foundation for designing the hydrothermal oxidation process as an on site treatment method for the sus wastewater before discharge and for optimizing operational parameters to reduce ecotoxicity in addition this work opens further research towards better understanding of the compositional effects of sus wastewaters as well as introducing the complementary use of specific chemical analyses and whole sample ecotoxicity testing credit authorship contribution statement nikolaos montesantos conceptualization methodology formal analysis
