16275,micro aeration hydrolysis acidification ha is an effective method to enhance the removal of toxic and refractory organic matter but the difficulty in stable dosing control of trace oxygen limits its wide application membrane based bubbleless aeration has been proved as an ideal aeration method because of its higher oxygen transfer rate more uniform mass transfer and lower cost than ha however the available information on its application in ha is limited in this study membrane based bubbleless micro aeration coupled with hydrolysis acidification mbl mha was exploited to investigate the performance of 2 4 dinitrophenol 2 4 dnp degradation via comparing it with bubble micro aeration ha mha and anaerobic ha the results indicated that the performances in mbl mha and mha were higher than those in ha during the experiment 2 4 dnp degradation rates under redox microenvironments caused by counter diffusion in mbl mha 84 43 97 28 were higher than those caused by co diffusion in mha 82 41 94 71 under micro aeration of 0 5 5 0 ml air min the 2 4 dnp degradation pathways in mbl mha were nitroreduction deamination aromatic ring cleavage and fermentation while those in mha were hydroxylation aromatic ring cleavage and fermentation reduction oxidation related interspecific electron transfer related species and fermentative species in mbl mha were more abundant than that in mha ultimately more reducing oxidizing forces formed by more redox proteins enzymes from these rich species could enhance 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha graphical abstract graphical abstract image

substance eps redox protein 1 introduction nitrophenols have been extensively used as essential raw materials for dyes plasticizers pesticides herbicides paints pharmaceuticals explosives and leather preservatives in the global chemical industry wu et al 2015 fajardo et al 2015 arora et al 2014 among the nitrophenols 2 4 dinitrophenol 2 4 dnp a representative nitrophenol has been ranked as a priority controlled pollutant by the united states environmental protection agency 2003 and must be appropriately treated because of its high toxicity oncogenicity and biological accumulation sasidharan pillai et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 several methods to treat 2 4 dnp containing wastewater via physicochemical treatment processes for example adsorption methods azari et al 2021 advanced reduction yang et al 2011 advanced oxidization hedayat et al 2018 and various other methods xiong et al 2019 have been investigated in the literature although they have achieved remarkable effects these methods have disadvantages such as the necessity to recycle chemicals the complex processes involved the high cost and the resultant secondary pollution naidu et al 2016 therefore in recent decades biological treatment methods have been widely used because of their high degradation efficiency and uncomplicated treatment or extraction processes hydrolytic acidification ha is an effective economical biotreatment method that plays a crucial role in changing refractory complex macromolecules such as aromatic hydrocarbons or heterocyclic substances into small molecules such as small molecule organic acids and alcohols and improving biodegradability via biological hydrolysis and acid production g song et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 therefore ha has been widely used to treat wastewater containing refractory and toxic organic matter g song et al 2017 however the hydrolysis of complex organic matter in the ha process is usually a rate limiting step song et al 2019 wu et al 2019 to solve this problem the literature has proposed new methods for enhancing hydrolysis efficiencies recently studies have reported that micro aeration dosing tract air or oxygen also known as limited aeration is an effective method to accelerate the hydrolysis of complex organic matter improve volatile fatty acid vfa production and increase biodegradability nguyen et al 2019 song et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 in general a dissolved oxygen do concentration in the range of 0 1 0 5 mg l corresponding to the oxidation reduction potential orp value of 300 0 mv can be defined as a micro aeration environment wu et al 2019 nguyen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 studies have reported that micro aeration ha enhances the hydrolysis of various refractory organic matter in wastewater such as nitrophenol benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene btex aniline and aldehydes compounds cheng et al 2015 firmino et al 2017 joão et al 2018 khan et al 2019 song et al 2019 for example khan et al 2019 reported that under 4 nitrophenol 4 np of 100 mg l in the influent the 4 np degradation rate reached 99 89 under micro aeration conditions do 0 5 mg l and it was only 4 under anaerobic conditions do 0 mg l joão et al 2018 demonstrated that under the conditions from the anaerobic to the micro aeration of 1 0 ml air min the removal rates of benzene and toluene increased from 55 to 67 and from 84 to 89 respectively the aniline removal rate reached up to 91 2 2 2 under micro aeration of 0 31 0 17 mg l and it was 15 8 1 1 without micro aeration cheng et al 2015 the phenol removal rate reached 80 7 in the micro aerated condition do 0 41 mg l and was 11 6 under anaerobic conditions yang et al 2018 nevertheless the stable dosing and precise control of trace oxygen is difficult which has limited the application of limited aeration as an effective operational strategy in ha kong et al 2019 nguyen et al 2019 for the stable dosing of trace oxygen in ha a suitable micro aeration dosing method should be established because it could affect the oxygen transfer rate otr and oxygen transfer efficiency by affecting the bubble size zhang et al 2021 micro aeration dosing methods usually include limited aeration hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and electrolysis wu et al 2018 tartakovsky et al 2003 2011 although some chemical oxidants such as h2o2 and calcium peroxide can release peroxides by reacting with water to elevate o2 levels they can also kill microorganisms and pollute aquatic ecosystems d wang et al 2019 limited aeration would be more promising than chemical oxidants because it could be nontoxic and without chemical additives especially for the enhancement of the ha process to fulfill the sustainable development goals generally under limited aeration the smaller bubble size the higher otr and the lower costs resulting from higher interfacial areas lower rise velocities stronger stability and higher gas utilization h wang et al 2020 john et al 2020 temesgen et al 2017 reported that the otr of nanobubbles diameter 1 μm was 125 times faster than that of bulk bubbles diameter 1000 nm john et al 2020 investigated the effect of limited aeration with nanobubbles and bulk bubbles into ha on cellulose degradation the results demonstrated that under the nanobubble micro aeration addition the reductions in cellulose content and cellulose crystallinity increased by 8 14 and 9 21 respectively in comparison with the bulk bubble micro aeration in recent years hydrophobic membranes such as silicone tubes polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and polypropylene membranes have proved ideal for injecting oxygen for efficient gas transfer unlike bubble aeration pressurized gas diffuses into the solution through the membrane module without forming bubbles achieving an approximately 100 higher otr more uniform mass transfer a lower supply pressure and a lower cost than bubble aeration aybar et al 2014 perez calleja et al 2017 hou et al 2019 the membranes can also serve as microorganism carriers facilitate abundant microorganisms to colonize the rough membrane surface and form biofilms kinh et al 2017 these biofilms consist of a stratified community embedded within a tight self produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps pellicer nacher et al 2014 which are highly resistant to toxicity and load shock li et al 2015 membrane based bubbleless aeration as an oxygen dosing method has been applied in activated sludge systems and mainly focused on simultaneous nitrification and denitrification hydrogen sulfide and organic matter removal wang et al 2009 sun et al 2016 x mei et al 2019 however the literature is limited on the coupling of the membrane based bubbleless micro aeration in ha for degrading toxic and refractory organic matters to nontoxic or low toxicity small molecular organic matters and ensuring the subsequent biodegradability rather than for removing chemical oxygen demand cod what might be feasible is to create a more stable and uniform micro aeration environment through the coupling of membrane based bubbleless micro aeration in ha however few attempts have been reported notably under the membrane based bubbleless micro aeration addition the supplied oxygen diffusion could be from the base of the biofilm to the bulk liquid and the supplied substrate diffusion could be from the bulk liquid to the base of the biofilm counter diffusion under the bubble micro aeration addition both supplied oxygen and substrate diffusion could be from the bulk liquid to the surface of the suspended sludge co diffusion wang et al 2009 as a result the microbial community structure could have different spatial microstructures between the two aeration methods caused by counter and co diffusion such as aerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones from the base of the biofilm to the bulk liquid for bubbleless aeration x mei et al 2019 and anaerobic anoxic and aerobic zones from the center of the suspended sludge to the bulk liquid for bubble aeration nguyen et al 2019 this opposite do spatial microstructure caused by counter and co diffusion might lead to different pollutant degradation effects according to the literature degradation products produced by 2 4 dnp differ under anaerobic and micro aeration conditions for example under anaerobic conditions degradation products of 2 4 dnp have been proven to be corresponding amino phenols namely 2 4 diaminophenol 2 4 dap 2 amino 4 nitrophenol 2 a 4 np and 2 nitro 4 aminophenol 2 n 4 ap kimura et al 2003 tang et al 2018 and under oxygen containing conditions nitro groups of 2 4 dnp could be released from the benzene ring and benzenethiol could be generated in which oxygenases play a major role x mei et al 2019 hence the degradation effects of 2 4 dnp might be different using the bubble and membrane based bubbleless limited aeration into ha due to the opposite do spatial microstructure however to date the effects of bubble and membrane based bubbleless micro aeration on 2 4 dnp degradation in ha have rarely been documented limited insights into the effects of limited aeration on the degradation pathways of 2 4 dnp and the molecular mechanisms of microbial community and microbiome protein expression have been reported thus far therefore in this study a membrane based bubbleless micro aeration coupled with the ha mbl mha process was exploited for 2 4 dnp degradation for the precise control of micro aeration mbl mha was equipped with an automatic temperature control system and a do online automatic monitoring system which was integrated into a programmable logic controller plc system it was operated continuously for 100 days to investigate the performance of 2 4 dnp degradation by comparing it with that of bubble micro aeration ha mha and anaerobic ha and the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the performance of 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha and mha under different limited aeration rates ii investigate the degradation pathways of 2 4 dnp in the mbl mha and mha systems and iii reveal the synergistic effects of 2 4 dnp degradation the microbial community and microbiomes protein expression in mbl mha and mha 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated wastewater and inoculum the three bioreactors were fed simulated wastewater the specific characteristics of the simulated wastewater were found as follows nh4cl of 191 4 mg l kh2po4 of 60 mg l mgcl2 6h2o of 200 mg l feso4 7h2o of 25 mg l cuso4 5h2o of 5 mg l cocl2 5h2o of 0 125 mg l mnso4 6h2o of 15 mg l and nahco3 of 1800 mg l zhang et al 2019 and ph was 7 1 7 4 generally the 2 4 dnp concentration was 2 120 mg l in actual industrial wastewater wu et al 2015 chen et al 2013 therefore glucose was used as the primary organic carbon source at a cod

approximately 55 1 8 mg l and uv254 was 0 85 0 03 in the simulated wastewater 2 4 dnp was purchased from sigma aldrich co usa other chemicals such as glucose nahco3 nh4cl kh2po4 mgso4 7h2o feso4 7h2o cuso4 5h2o cocl2 5h2o and mnso4 6h2o were obtained from the xihui chemical factory chaoyang beijing 2 4 dnp was guaranteed reagent grade and the other chemicals were of analytical reagent grade the inoculum sludge was collected from a 100 l expanded granular sludge bed reactor that has stably operated for more than 2 years with glucose as the organic substrate and an organic load rate of 6 0 kg cod m3 d in the laboratory the concentration of suspended solids ss and volatile suspended solids vss was 12 5 0 5 g l and 9 2 0 4 g l and vss ss was approximately 0 73 characteristics of the inoculum sludge are listed in tab s1 2 2 bioreactor set up and operation in this experiment three ha reactors were operated in parallel mbl mha mha and ha as a control operated under anaerobic conditions a hollow fiber membrane made from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf for bubbleless micro aeration was supplied by mbl mha the membrane module was composed of ten membrane tubes with a length of 100 cm and was encapsulated by epoxy resin it had an inner diameter of 2 5 mm an outer diameter of 2 8 mm a wall thickness of 0 15 mm a micropore size of 0 15 μm and a contact angle of 89 84 1 57 the bubble

of 50 mm and a total height of 1200 mm and had a total working volume of 2 35 l the reactors were operated with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h a schematic of these reactors is shown in fig 1 an automatic temperature control system was installed in each reactor to maintain the temperature of the system at 25 0 2 c the air flow rate from the compressor tank was finely maintained using a trace mass gas flowmeter horiba s49 33 mt china the do concentration was measured using an automatically monitored online system inesa sjg 9435b china to avoid the do probe surface by air or oxygen bubble adsorption which affects the monitoring accuracy do was monitored at the ectopic site in these bioreactors the do monitoring probe was outside the reactor and the mixed liquid in the reactor flowed through the do monitoring probe in the form of uniform turbulent flow to achieve do monitoring the automatic temperature control system trace mass gas flowmeter and do were automatically monitored online and controlled using a plc system siemens germany the specific process was as follows the do online monitoring probe was immersed in the flow cup the mixture in the reactor continuously and stably flowed into the flow cup from the bottom through a peristaltic pump and then flowed out to the secondary sedimentation tank through overflow in the flow cup the entire process was conducted under sealed conditions a schematic of the circulation cup structure is shown in fig s1 when the air pressure was below the membrane bubble point pressure its bubbleless aeration could form achieving an approximately 100 higher otr more uniform mass transfer a lower supply pressure and a lower cost than bubble aeration aybar et al 2014 perez calleja et al 2017 hou et al 2019 it is therefore necessary to determine the membrane bubble point pressure the specific determination steps were based on those in the literature wu et al 2019 the membrane module was completely immersed in water with one end connected to a sterile pressurized air bottle and the other end sealed then a trace mass gas flowmeter was switched on to control the air flow rate the bubble point was the pressure in the membrane s inner lumen when the first bubble began to appear on the membrane s surface the performance of 2 4 dnp degradation in the three bioreactors under different limited aeration conditions was investigated the operating conditions of these bioreactors comprised three phases phase i air flow rate of 0 5 ml min days 1 35 phase ii air flow rate of 3 0 ml min days 36 65 and phase iii air flow rate of 5 0 ml min days 66 100 the air pressure was 25 kpa at each phase each phase was operated for no less than 30 days to ensure the stable operation of each phase in each stage stable performance a quasi steady state was achieved no significant difference anova p 0 05 in each monitoring parameter during five consecutive days of operation and the next stage was operated the ph

zhang et al 2021 the fluorescence peaks of 3d eem can be categorized into five main regions tyrosine like tryptophan like fulvic acid like soluble microbial by product like and humic acid like tab s2 chen et al 2003 henderson et al 2009 the parallel factor parafac technique was used to separate the fluorescence spectra from the 3d eem to avoid any overlapping of the fluorescence spectra the specific steps of the parafac analysis are described in song et al 2019 the eps structure could affect the morphologies of sludge and biofilm chen et al 2021 a scanning electron microscope sem s4800 hsd hitachi japan was used to observe the microstructure of suspended sludge of mbl mha biofilm on the membrane surface of mbl mha and suspended sludges of mha and anaerobic ha during stable operation in phase ii 2 4 3 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing analysis in this study sludge samples including suspended sludge of mbl mha mbl mha i biofilm on the membrane surface of mbl mha mbl mha ii and suspended sludges of mha and anaerobic ha were collected during stable operation in phase ii the operation process of microbial structure analysis was based on the literature song et al 2019 tian et al 2020 dna was extracted from sludge samples using the tiangen soil dna kit tiangen biotech china by following the manufacturer s protocol the extracts were stored at 20 c until further

the illumina miseq platform at sinogenomax co ltd beijing china 2 5 label free quantitative proteomic profiling four samples mbl mha i mbl mha ii mha and anaerobic ha were selected for further analysis by label free quantitative proteomics the operation process referred to the literature zhang et al 2019 2020 the detailed information is provided in the supporting information a text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of bioreactors under different air flow rates during each phase mbl mha mha and anaerobic ha air flow rate of 0 ml min were gradually stabilized after continuous running for one month these reactors were run continuously for 100 days from phase i to phase iii to investigate the performance of 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha and mha by setting the micro aeration rate from 0 to 5 0 ml min fig 2 as shown in fig 2 in phase i the removal rates of 2 4 dnp cod tn and uv254 in the micro aeration ha mbl mha and mha at an air flow rate of 0 5 ml min were obviously higher than that in the anaerobic ha ad and effluent our were significantly increased in mbl mha and mha but not in anaerobic ha these results indicate that limited aeration into ha could result in an enhanced 2 4 dnp removal rate and acid production additionally with an increasing air flow rate from 0 5 to 3 0 ml min the 2 4 dnp removal rates in mbl mha and mha ranged from 84 32 1 90 to 97 28 0 51 and from 82 41 0 43 to 94 71 0 35 respectively the cod and tn removal rates also increased from 55 42 1 11 to 68 13 1 24 and from 42 21 1 11 to 51 87 0 87 in mbl mha from 54 31 0 46 to 65 32 0 94 and from 39 43 0 35 to 45 69 0 73 in mha respectively when the air flow rate was from 0 5 to 3 0 ml min under the uv254 value of 0 65 0 02 in the influent uv254 values in the effluent also obviously decreased from 0 12 0 02 to 0 04 0 01 in mbl mha and from 0 15 0 02 to 0 07 0 01 in mha the lower uv254 values the lower aromatic constituents in the wastewater wan et al 2020 these results demonstrated that at an air flow rate of 3 0 l min the aromatic constituent in the effluent of the micro aeration ha effluent was lower than that at an air flow rate of 0 5 ml min the high aromatic constituent uv254 value in the influent was mainly contributed to the 2 4 dnp existed in the influent in the two micro aeration ha systems at an air flow rate of 3 0 l min 2 4 dnp degradation rates 97 28 0 51 of mbl mha and 94 71 0 35 of mha were higher than the uv254 removal rates 93 85 0 18 of mbl mha and 89 23 0 21 of mha indicating that the degradation intermediates of 2 4 dnp might contain aromatic organics and could mainly contribute to the effluent aromatic constituent as a result the lower uv254 values in the effluent of the two micro aeration ha systems at an air flow rate of 3 0 l min were compared with those of 0 5 ml min and indicated that the content of aromatic organics from the degradation intermediates of 2 4 dnp of 3 0 l min was lower than that of 0 5 ml min and that 2 4 dnp could be degraded even more thoroughly than in the literature additionally effluent ad at an air flow rate of 3 0 ml min was significantly increased to 78 48 1 51 in mbl mha and 74 58 1 72 in mha and it was 73 21 1 33 in mbl mha and 68 73 1 51 in mha at an air flow rate of 0 5 ml min indicating that limited aeration 3 0 ml min could improve vfa production vfas can serve as organic carbon sources to accelerate the removal of biological nutrients and improve the biodegradability of wastewater w s lee et al 2014 additionally under an air flow rate from 0 5 ml min to 3 0 ml min effluent our values also obviously improved from 14 82 0 41 mg o2 g mlss h to 18 42 0 31 mg o2 g mlss h in mbl mha and from 13 34 0 53 mg o2 g mlss h to 15 84 0 52 mg o2 g mlss h in mha respectively these results indicated that the inhibitory effect of the influent containing toxic 2 4 dnp on activated sludge decreased obviously through the treatment of micro aeration ha the limited aeration 3 0 ml min into ha can enhance the treatability of the wastewater containing toxic 2 4 dnp and the effluent is more suitable for the following aerobic biological treatment processes firmo et al 2018 reported that under the btex of 3 mg l in the influent when the air flow rate was 0 5 ml min the micro aeration ha assured high removal efficiencies 80 for all compounds of btex joão et al 2018 reported that benzene exhibited a 30 increase in its removal efficiency under a flow rate of 1 0 ml air min in the micro aeration ha a trace amount of oxygen in ha could increase the number of oxygenases to improve the removal of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds e g btex and nitrophenol wu et al 2015 2018 in this study the optimum air flow rate was 3 0 ml min which was inconsistent with the literature this result might be attributed to the optimum do concentration being related to the type and concentration of the substance hence the effects of organic load rates on the performance of mbl mha for the treatment of 2 4 dnp should be investigated however with a further increase in the air flow rate to 5 0 ml min the 2 4 dnp tn and uv254 removal rates and effluent our decreased in mbl mha and mha the deterioration of 2 4 dnp degradation when applying more air could be attributed to the following under excessive oxygen 2 4 dnp could not be easily degraded because of its chemical structures with electron absorbing nitro groups and negatively charged benzene rings zhang et al 2021 in addition the biomass of the biofilm on the membrane surface in phase i iii were 20 98 0 46 g m2 25 85 0 29 g m2 and 23 91 0 62 g m2 which demonstrated that the appropriate air flow rate could promote the growth of microorganisms on the membrane surface while excessive oxygen might destroy the micro aeration environment and reduce the biomass on the membrane surface notably ad decreased to 61 45 2 32 in mbl mha and 58 32 1 28 in mha and the cod removal rates obviously increased to 78 36 1 45 in mbl mha and 76 82 1 12 in mha similar results have been reported mozo et al 2011 wu et al 2015 for example wu et al 2015 reported that with a further increase in do from 0 3 to 0 4 mg l to 0 4 0 5 mg l for the pretreatment of petrochemical wastewater in ha vfa production decreased from 1 68 mg l to 1 01 mg l the bod5 cod ratio of the effluent decreased significantly from 0 31 to 0 20 and the cod removal rate increased from 24 9 to 31 6 these results were mainly attributed to the following vfas can be oxidized by excess oxygen when applying more air the 2 4 dnp degradation and fermentation ability could be enhanced in the micro aeration ha system when applying a suitable limited aeration 3 0 ml min into the ha however a much higher limited aeration would result in a negative effect on reactor performance in the micro aeration ha in this study 2 4 dnp degradation efficiency using the micro aeration ha at phase ii was higher than the reports in the literature for 2 4 dnp degradation using an anaerobic biological process for example dai et al 2009 reported that under 2 4 dnp of 0 25 mmol l in wastewater the 2 4 dnp degradation rate was 75 28 after adding nadh in an anaerobic biological process she et al 2005 reported that under 2 4 dnp of 2 45 mg l in wastewater the 2 4 dnp degradation rate was 10 65 1 in an anaerobic digestion process as indicated in the literature in the presence of low oxygen concentrations microbial activity can be improved nguyen et al 2019 and the amount of mono oxygenases can be increased to improve the removal of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds e g nitrophenol varjani 2017 additionally the addition of trace oxygen in an ha as a terminal electron acceptor could accelerate the hydrolysis of long chain organic compounds under facultative bacteria promoting 2 4 dnp transformation zhang et al 2021 however when the applied limited aeration was too high such as 5 0 ml min in this study the oxygen might be excessive in the reactor which could cause the deterioration of 2 4 dnp degradation and oxidization of vfas wu et al 2015 moreover the 2 4 dnp and uv254 degradation rates and effluent ad and our in the mbl mha were significantly higher than those in the mha these results demonstrated that membrane based bubbleless limited aeration into ha could augment 2 4 dnp degradation and fermentation ability even more than that with bubble micro aeration into ha in addition the bubble size and aeration intensity not only influence the shear force on sludge and biofilm but also affect the oxygen diffusion efficiency in bulk liquid sludge and biofilm inside zhao et al 2021 li et al 2004 resulting in different chemical changes e g oxygen and redox potential and spatial stratification inside sludge and biofilm li et al 2004 the performance of the bioreactor could be affected by microenvironments with different chemical changes and spatial stratifications inside sludge and biofilm li et al 2004 the do and orp were measured by microelectrodes to profile the microenvironment of the biofilm in mbl mha and the suspended sludge in mha under different limited aeration conditions fig 3 three to five biofilm samples from mbl mha and suspended sludge samples from mha were tested the diameters of the suspended sludge used in this study were determined to be 1 0 1 5 mm suspended sludge smaller than 1 0 mm could not be sufficiently stabilized in the batch reactor for accurate microelectrode measurements additionally the 1 0 1 5 mm depths of the biofilm was also determined for accurate microelectrode measurements an obviously chemically heterogeneous microstructure was detected in the biofilm and suspended sludge under different limited aeration conditions for example for mbl mha the counter diffusion direction between do and 2 4 dnp is shown during phase i do inside the biofilm increased from 0 mg l at the top 0 4 mm of the biofilm to 0 084 0 004 mg l of membrane biofilm interface biofilm depth 0 μm and the corresponding orp values increased from 289 34 0 35 mv to 119 27 0 21 mv in phase ii do began to increase from the top 1 3 mm of the biofilm 0 mg l and reached 0 28 0 003 mg l on the membrane biofilm interface the corresponding orp values increased from 276 23 0 26 mv to 75 84 0 18 mv in phase iii do increased from 0 12 0 018 mg l at the top 0 8 mm of the biofilm to 0 39 0 015 mg l of membrane biofilm interface and the corresponding orp values increased from 104 26 0 18 mv to 67 39 0 21 mv in phase ii the anaerobic zone was thus limited to the surface layer of the biofilm and bulk liquid and the remaining biofilm was micro aerated in mbl mha a biofilm stratification structure and a significant change in redox status resulting from a single do gradient in phase ii was more obvious than that in phases i and iii for mha the co diffusion direction between do and 2 4 dnp is shown for example during phase i do was approximately 0 06 0 017 mg l in the bulk liquid and do inside the suspend sludge was depleted in the top 1 0 mm of the sludge and the corresponding orp values decreased from 139 47 0 22 mv to 291 29 0 28 mv during phase ii do decreased from 0 23 0 035 mg l in the bulk liquid to 0 mg l in the top 1 2 mm in the center of the sludge according to the decreasing orp values from 79 49 0 28 mv to 279 29 0 28 mv in phase iii do decreased from 0 36 0 032 mg l in the bulk liquid to 0 21 0 017 mg l in the center of the sludge according to the increasing orp values from 64 24 0 37 mv to 81 25 0 19 mv in phase ii the micro aeration zone was thus limited to the surface layer of the suspended sludge and bulk liquid and the remaining sludge was anaerobic a more obvious sludge stratification structure resulting from a single do gradient in phase ii was also achieved in mha compared with that in phases i and iii in addition because of the opposite diffusion direction of do between mbl mha counter diffusion and mha co diffusion the redox microenvironments during the degradation of 2 4 dnp were also opposite for mbl mha because the surface layer of the biofilm and bulk liquid were anaerobic and the remaining biofilm was micro aerated 2 4 dnp could be degraded first by anaerobic degradation on the surface layer of the biofilm and suspended sludge and then by microaerobic degradation in the biofilm for mha because the surface layer of the suspended sludge and bulk liquid was microaerobic and the inside of the sludge was anaerobic 2 4 dnp could be degraded first by microaerobic degradation on the surface layer of the suspended sludge and bulk liquid and then by anaerobic degradation inside the sludge to measure and compare the conversion rates in mbl mha and mha systems oxygen fluxes at different volumetric locations inside the biofilm and suspended sludge samples were calculated based on our microelectrode measurements table 1 tab one showed that oxygen fluxes inside the samples from the two micro aeration ha systems in phase ii were higher than those in phases i and iii and under the same limited aeration conditions those in mbl mha were also higher than those in the mha these oxygen flux results were lower than those reported for sludge li et al 2004 a possible reason for this difference is that the do in this study was below 0 5 mg l which was much lower than the do saturated water used in other studies the literature reported that under high aeration conditions the oxygen flux measured by a cathodically polarized oxygen microelectrode was higher than the true oxygen flux perhaps caused by ignoring the possible influence of convective mass transport and oxygen consumption inside the biofilm and the standard variation was higher than when a lower do was used li et al 2004 some studies have reported that a higher oxygen flux confirmed a higher oxygen utilization capacity and metabolic rates of microorganisms schramm et al 1996 li et al 2004 additionally diffusion resistance is one of the main factors influencing oxygen flux and oxygen bubble size is one of the main factors influencing diffusion resistance li et al 2004 generally the oxygen transfer coefficient kla h 1 has been used to evaluate diffusion resistance x mei et al 2019 coefficients of bubble and membrane based bubbleless micro aeration in clean water were investigated tab s3 the kla values of the bubbleless limited aeration were 1 23 1 74 h 1 under different operational conditions which was higher than those of the bubble limited aeration which were 0 88 1 22 h 1 wu et al 2019 reported similar results that is kla values increased from 1 33 h 1 to 1 42 h 1 when the bubble size of aeration decreased from 0 16 μm to 0 10 μm these results demonstrated that the oxygen utilization capacity and metabolic rates of microorganisms could be enhanced compared with those of bubble limited aeration because of the higher oxygen transfer ability of the membrane based bubbleless limited aeration 3 2 metabolites of 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha and mha in most cases even when the parent compound is completely degraded some intermediate products remain in the water environment li et al 2021 tang et al 2018 investigated the degradation products of 2 4 dnp under anoxic conditions and found that 2 4 dap 2 a 4 np 2 n 4 ap phenol and small molecule acids were produced under anoxic conditions in this study six main intermediate products were detected by lc ms in mbl mha 2 4 dap 2 a 4 np 2 n 4 ap 2 np 4 np phenol and benzoic acid fig s3 and 4 nitrocatechol 2 nitrohydroquinone and benzenethiol were mainly detected by lc ms in mha fig s3 these intermediate products were different between mbl mha and mha indicating that the degradation pathways of 2 4 dnp might be different to analyze the denitration characteristics of 2 4 dnp in the mbl mha and mha systems this study investigated nitrogen transformations within a given hrt by using the batch reaction mode under phase ii fig s4 the nh4 n concentration increased rapidly and then decreased in mbl mha and it remained relatively stable close to zero in the mha for mbl mha the nitro groups on the benzene ring were first reduced to amino groups generating the corresponding aminophenols such as 2 4 dap 2 a 4 np and 2 n 4 ap in addition the nh4 n concentration decreased rapidly and the no2 n concentration increased rapidly and then decreased indicating that nitrosification and denitrification might occur simultaneously in mbl mha nh4 n could be conversed to no2 n at do of 0 2 0 4 mg l wang et al 2009 for mha the no2 n concentration increased more rapidly than in mbl mha probably because of the accumulation of no2 n caused by the shedding of nitro groups in addition the no2 n concentration generally decreased indicating that denitrification might have occurred in mha based on the properties of 2 4 dnp and the products detected from lc ms the possible pathways of 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha were nitroreduction deamination from the benzene ring and simultaneous nitrosification and denitrification and the possible pathways in mha were hydroxylation nitro group removal from the benzene ring and denitrification fig 4 these results were due to the counter diffusion in mbl mha and co diffusion in mha which might lead to different degradation pathways of 2 4 dnp in mbl mha 2 4 dnp could be transferred first to the corresponding aminophenol such as 2 a 4 np 2 n 4 ap and 2 4 dap in the suspended sludge and the surface layer of the biofilm through the nitroreduction process under anaerobic conditions jiang et al 2016 next the corresponding aminophenol could be further degraded to phenol through the deamination process tang et al 2018 in addition phenol could be degraded to benzoic acid and then to acetate under micro aeration in the biofilm in mha hydroxylation and denitration of 2 4 dnp could occur on the outer layer of the suspended sludge under micro aeration and nitrite and benzenethiol were produced subsequently nitrite can be removed through the denitrification process 3 3 variations of eps fig 5 a and 5 b show the variations in the lb eps and tb eps contents polysaccharide protein and nucleic acid of mbl mha and mha under different limited aeration conditions and anaerobic ha fig 5 a and 5 b show that protein content was more dominant than polysaccharide and nucleic acid contents in eps production in the three systems the protein content in phase ii was higher than that in phases i and iii and that in biofilms in mbl mha was higher than that in suspended sludge in mbl mha and mha the protein of eps is mainly related to extracellular enzymes or structural proteins tian et al 2021 extracellular enzymes could be important for capturing or adhering to water soluble and water insoluble organic compounds in the matrix providing nutrients for the microbe growth and promoting the transformation of organic matter structural proteins non enzymatic proteins are the main components of eps proteins such as cell surface binding and extracellular carbohydrate binding proteins appropriate limited aeration into ha could promote various extracellular enzyme activities ruan et al 2019 which could be one of the main reasons for the increased protein content of eps in phase ii additionally zhang et al 2015 reported that compared with that in suspended sludge eps protein in biofilms also contained more structural proteins to promote cell adhesion the eps protein could also affect the morphologies of sludge and biofilm chen et al 2021 the morphologies of suspended sludge of mbl mha biofilm on the membrane surface of mbl mha and suspended sludges of mha and anaerobic ha during stable operation in phase ii were observed through sem in fig s7 from fig s7 the rod shaped bacteria and spheroidal bacteria were dominant under micro aeration and the suspended sludge under micro aeration was more dense than that in ha meanwhile a certain thickness of biofilm was uniformly attached to the membrane surface and the structure of biofilm was more dense than the suspended sludge moreover the protein content of tb eps was higher than that of lb eps in the four samples similar results have been reported by ye et al 2011 and zhang et al 2014 these results might occur because the compositions and properties of lb eps are unstable and easily influenced by external conditions by contrast the stable composition and function of tb eps are less affected by the environment ye et al 2011 studies have reported that tb eps have strong biosorption ability and their functional groups play a significant role in the biosorption of suspended sludge and biofilms gao et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 the 3d eem spectroscopy and parafac methods have been proved to be appropriate methods for eps analysis sheng and yu 2006 thus they were also used in this study for eps analysis the parafac models of tb eps and lb eps in the four samples with different micro aeration conditions revealed that the fluorescence could be characterized by four components fig 5 c component 1 resembled the tryptophan like protein ex em 225 350 nm and soluble microbial byproduct like matter ex em 275 350 nm chen et al 2003 component 2 mainly showed tyrosine like fluorescence ex em 220 300 nm chen et al 2003 guo et al 2012 components 1 and 2 have been ascribed to protein like fluorophores baghoth et al 2011 component 3 exhibited fmax at ex em wavelengths of 265 475 nm and 425 475 nm which are associated with humic acid like fluorescence chen et al 2003 component 4 mainly showed fulvic acid like fluorescence ex em 220 300 nm chen et al 2003 parafac analysis also provided quantitative information based on the fmax values of the four components in the lb eps and tb eps samples under varying micro aeration conditions fig 5 d e the protein like substances components 1 and 2 were major constituents in the lb eps and tb eps samples and those in the tb eps were higher than those in the lb eps the fmax of components 1 and 2 in tb eps in phase ii was higher than that in phases i and iii and that in the biofilm in mbl mha was higher than that in suspended sludge in mbl mha and mha which indicated that there were more abundant tyrosine like and tryptophan like protein substances in tb eps in phase ii and in the biofilm in mbl mha these results were consistent with the protein content in the tb eps samples during phases i iii the increased fmax of protein like substances in tb eps in phase ii demonstrated that it played a certain role in organic matter removal and transformation in the biosorption process song et al 2019 aquino et al 2004 investigated the interaction between protein like substances in eps and chloroform indicating that the interaction increased as the amount of protein like substances increased to further investigate the changes in the chemical structures and functionalities of eps in mbl mha mha and anaerobic ha uv vis and ft ir qualitative spectra of lb eps and tb eps from biofilm in the mbl mha and suspended sludge in the mbl mha and mha were used in phase ii fig s5 and s6 fig s5 shows that there was a weak absorption peak at 275 nm in lb eps and tb eps in the three systems the uv vis absorption peaks of aromatic proteins in eps generally range from 245 nm to 290 nm which belong to the n π and π π electron transfer of the c o and c c groups from tryptophan and tyrosine he et al 2020 the absorbance of mbl mha ii was lower than that of mha and anaerobic ha and the protein content in tb eps of mbl mha ii was higher than that of mha and anaerobic ha indicating that stronger interactions among tb eps 2 4 dnp and its transformation products might occur in the biofilm he et al 2020 a general belief is that the 1800 600 cm 1 region of the ft ir spectra can provide information on the compositions chemical structures and functionalities of eps components badireddy et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 fig s6 shows the ft ir qualitative spectra of lb eps and tb eps which mainly included six predominant peaks associated with several characteristic functional groups in general the ft ir profiles for mbl mha mha and ha were similar indicating that the main functional groups were similar for these epss the peaks at 1650 cm 1 1525 cm 1 and 1425 cm 1 were assigned to the c o stretching vibration of the amide i n h deformation vibration of amide ii and the c n stretching vibration of amide iii respectively badireddy et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 the band at 1100 cm 1 was related to the c o c and c h stretching vibrations of the polysaccharide structures wang et al 2012 the band at 1100 cm 1 may also be associated with the p o and c p o vibrations badireddy et al 2010 fang et al 2012 these results indicated that extracellular proteins could bind or mix carbohydrates and phosphorylated macromolecules the ranges of 600 900 cm 1 belonged to the fingerprint region which mainly reflects the presence of carbohydrates and nucleic acids badireddy et al 2010 yin et al 2015 the ft ir spectra showed that the eps contained proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids and other substances which was consistent with the composition of eps according to the literature zhang et al 2019 extracellular enzymes with oxidoreductase activity in eps in ha generally act on the choh chch ch ch2 group of donors and those with hydrolase activity generally act on cn in addition redox active oxygen containing functional groups such as c o can facilitate microbial reduction of organic matter wu et al 2017 ren et al 2020 revealed that surface oxygen containing functional groups of hydrochar could mediate direct interspecies electron transfer in an anaerobic digestion system xiao et al 2017 reported that redox proteins in eps could be the transient media of interspecies interactions through its function of interspecific electron transfer to promote the removal of organic matter these peaks of redox active functional groups in tb eps in ft ir were stronger than those in lb eps and those of biofilm in mbl mha was stronger than that of suspended sludge in mha and anaerobic ha indicating a greater abundance of redox proteins with oxidoreductase activity in the biofilm of the mbl mha 3 4 microbial community analysis illumina miseq high throughput sequencing was used to reveal the microbial community structure of the different sludge samples the community richness and alpha diversity indices of the samples are shown in table 2 the coverage of each sample was 0 999 indicating that the sequence analysis represented an almost complete microbial population the ace and chao indices indicate microbial community richness and the shannon and simpson indices represent microbial community diversity jena et al 2016 the observed ace and chao indices in the samples from mbl mha and mha were higher than those from anaerobic ha indicating that the microbial community became relatively more diverse under micro aeration conditions additionally shannon indices in the samples from mbl mha and mha were higher than those from anaerobic ha and simpson indices in the samples from mbl mha and mha were closer to 0 than those from anaerobic ha indicating that the microbial community was richer under micro aeration conditions these results indicate that suitable limited aeration in ha could increase microbial community richness and diversity this result is similar to that reported nguyen et al 2019 krayzelova et al 2015 notably the samples from mbl mha ii showed a higher diversity shannon index of 4 32 simpson index of 0 042 and richness ace index of 621 chao index of 603 than those from mha shannon index of 4 11 simpson index of 0 048 ace index of 609 chao index of 593 indicating that the microbial community richness and diversity became relatively richer under the membrane based bubbleless micro aeration in ha than that under the bubble micro aeration in ha high biodiversity and richness can increase ecological stability which would result in a high capacity to resist environmental stress zhang et al 2013 the venn diagram of these samples fig 5 c shows that the otus shared by mbl mha i mbl mha ii mha and anaerobic ha accounted for 23 of the total otus and the number of unique otus was 46 113 93 and 62 respectively according to the results of the biofilm microenvironment fig 3 the microbial community structures from the membrane biofilm interface biofilm depth 0 μm to bulk liquid were divided into more obvious micro aeration and anaerobic zones which resulted in increased greater biodiversity and explain why the otu number of mbl mha ii was higher than that of mha ma et al 2017 x mei et al 2019 the higher synergistic effects of various microorganisms in mbl mha resulted in higher efficient 2 4 dnp degradation the diversity of microorganisms at the phylum and genus levels in the three reactors is shown in fig 6 the illumina results indicated that the bacterial community was mainly composed of 37 phyla except for unclassified bacteria in mbl mha 35 phyla in mha and 32 phyla in anaerobic ha as shown in fig 6a the relative microbial community abundances were identified at the phylum level and bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi synergistetes actinobacteria and proteobacteria were dominant in these five samples with minor phyla accounting for a small fraction the main differences between the micro aeration ha and the anaerobic ha systems were attributed to the distribution of phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi synergistetes and actinobacteria relative abundances of the phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi synergistetes and actinobacteria were 16 15 18 4 16 81 12 46 and 14 84 in mbl mha and 14 74 20 45 14 12 14 17 and 12 46 in mha respectively which were significantly higher than those in anaerobic ha that is 8 80 13 56 11 69 9 17 and 7 62 respectively indicating that limited aeration could help selectively enrich specific species however relative abundances of the phyla proteobacteria and patescibacteria were 5 13 and 2 14 in mbl mha and 2 10 and 1 53 in mha respectively which was lower than that in anaerobic ha 11 67 and 17 80 respectively additionally relative abundances of these phyla in the mbl mha were also obviously higher than those in mha indicating that mbl mha was more favorable for selective enrichment of some specific species than mha additionally the relative bacterial community abundances of the suspended sludge mbl mha i and biofilm mbl mha ii in mbl mha were also identified at the phylum level fig 6a the relative abundances of bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria in the biofilm were 25 62 12 88 and 19 30 respectively and significantly higher than those in the suspended sludge 11 68 3 77 and 0 62 respectively nevertheless the relative abundances of chloroflexi synergistetes and actinobacteria in the suspended sludge 19 45 20 21 and 19 43 were obviously higher than those of the biofilm 7 67 4 66 and 8 84 respectively these results indicated that spatial distribution of the specific bacteria could be achieved using membrane based bubbleless micro aeration a similar spatial distribution structure has been reported wang et al 2009 kinh et al 2017 ma et al 2017 for example kinh et al 2017 found that nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria were gradually distributed from the membrane surface to the bulk liquid which realized simultaneous nitrification and denitrification these results could mainly be attributed to the following a single do gradient structure within the biofilm from the membrane biofilm interface to the bulk liquid caused by counter diffusion was clearly presented showing spatial variations of some specific species kinh et al 2017 ma et al 2017 the next objective was to gain insight into the microbial community structure in the three sludge samples thus the sequences from the dominant bacterial communities were analyzed at the genus level as follows fig 6b compared with the phylum level classifications the results of the genus level illustrated a greater diversity in the microbial communities in mbl mha mha and anaerobic ha samples which were composed of 334 318 and 262 genera respectively as shown in fig 6b differences were observed despite most of the genera being found in the five samples syner 01 5 64 georgenia 4 14 and sbr1031 6 24 were dominant in anaerobic ha syner 01 belonging to the phylum synergistetes includes hydrolytic bacteria with the ability to produce acetate through glucose fermentation si et al 2016 georgenia phylum actinobacteria is associated with the production of abundant hydrolytic enzymes that utilize organic matter such as glucose and is related to butyric acid production liu et al 2016 chen et al 2020a b c nelson et al 2011 sbr1031 phylum chloroflexi has been widely reported to utilize various substrates such as organic acids and have strong resistance to toxic organic pollutants chen et al 2020a b c nakasaki et al 2019 studies have demonstrated that actinobacteria and chloroflexi are important 2 4 dnp degrading bacteria in anaerobic conditions kimura et al 2003 arnett et al 2009 yang et al 2015 and under anaerobic conditions these bacteria can degrade 2 4 dnp into corresponding aminophenols including 2 4 dap 2 a 4 np and 2 n 4 ap kimura et al 2003 tang et al 2018 additionally under the micro aeration condition these facultative bacteria could by using molecular oxygen further accelerate the decomposition of these aminophenols resulting in the nh4 n release an et al 2020 in both micro aeration ha systems bacteroidetes vadinha17 7 55 of mbl mha 10 18 of mha mesotoga 4 55 of mbl mha 7 54 of mha and trichococcus 2 17 of mbl mha 10 28 of mha had higher relative abundances than those in anaerobic ha 2 07 1 46 and 1 78 moreover lentimicrobium 2 78 of mbl mha 0 78 of mha petrimonas 5 38 of mbl mha 1 44 of mha and fermentibacteraceae 3 61 of mbl mha 2 46 of mha were remarkably enriched in the two limited aeration ha systems nevertheless they showed the least relative abundance in anaerobic ha 0 15 0 47 and 0 62 respectively fermentibacteraceae and trichococcus within firmicutes can convert various organics to vfas by secreting various extracellular enzymes and subsequently to acetate h2 and co2 zhang et al 2018 owusu agyeman et al 2021 specifically the ability to tolerate high organic loading and toxic substances has also been reported jia et al 2019 yang et al 2016 ma et al 2020 lentimicrobium and bacteroidetes vadinha17 are highly related to the treatment of nitrate wastewater and denitrification processes niu et al 2021 h wang et al 2020 mielcarek et al 2016 notably petrimonas can metabolize amino acids to ethanol by transferring electrons to the limited molecular oxygen resulting from the promotion of interspecific electron transfer in the ha system wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 botheju et al 2009 reported that trace oxygen in an anaerobic bioreactor could act as a terminal electron acceptor to accelerate the hydrolysis of long chain organic compounds under facultative bacteria improving the electron transfer activity of microbial metabolism the relative abundance of this genus in mbl mha was significantly higher than that in mha indicating that the addition of micro aeration in ha could stimulate electron transfer activity of microbial metabolism especially membrane based bubbleless limited aeration moreover compared with that in mha and anaerobic ha the more differences were attributed to the distributions of the genera brevundimonas 7 53 and nitrosomonas 2 95 in mbl mha brevundimonas belonging to proteobacteria could enhance the decomposition of nitrogen containing organic matter such as aminophenols by using limited aeration resulting in the release of nh4 n he et al 2021 and nitrosomonas within proteobacteria oxidized nh4 n to no2 n by using free oxygen under a do below 0 5 mg l h wang et al 2020 in mbl mha relative abundances of brevundimonas 13 44 nitrosomonas 2 08 lentimicrobium 4 85 and petrimonas 9 46 from the biofilm were remarkably higher than those of the suspended sludge that is 0 01 0 01 0 21 and 0 30 respectively which might attribute to the fact that these genes were more attuned to micro aeration condition the syner 01 11 75 georgenia 14 32 and sbr1031 8 46 of the suspended sludge were richer than those of the biofilm 2 71 3 76 and 3 41 respectively according to the potential functions of these domain bacteria in the two micro aeration ha systems these dominant bacteria can be divided into four groups reduction associated bacteria oxidation associated bacteria interspecific electron transfer associated bacteria and fermentative bacteria in mha the oxidation associated bacteria such as syner 01 georgenia and sbr1031 could play a major role in denitration from nitrophenol reduction associated bacteria such as lentimicrobium and bacteroidetes vadinha17 could play a major role in denitrification the interspecific electron transfer associated bacteria were mainly represented by petrimonas which could improve the activity of microbial metabolism in ha fermentative bacteria such as fermentibacteraceae and trichococcus mainly convert the degradation intermediates of nitrophenol to vfas unlike the mha the reduction and oxidation associated bacteria in the mbl mha exhibited different functions in degrading 2 4 dnp specifically reduction associated bacteria could play a major role in ammoniation for reducing 2 4 dnp into corresponding aminophenols and denitrification such as syner 01 georgenia sbr1031 lentimicrobium and bacteroidetes vadinha17 these bacteria were mainly enriched in suspended sludge the oxidation associated bacteria could play a major role in the deamination of aminophenols and nitrosation such as brevundimonas and nitrosomonas these bacteria were mainly enriched in biofilms the fermentative bacteria could mainly convert the degradation intermediates of 2 4 dnp to vfas such as fermentibacteraceae and trichococcus the interspecific electron transfer associated bacteria were mainly represented by petrimonas which could improve the activity of microbial metabolism in the ha system these species were mainly enriched in the biofilm as indicated improved biodiversity enrichment of reduction related and oxidation related species within syntrophic interactions improvement in interspecific electron transfer related species and fermentative species might play a major role in enhancing 2 4 dnp degradation in micro aeration ha moreover these functional bacteria could be more enriched using membrane based bubbleless micro aeration because of a more obvious spatial distribution of the specific bacteria in the biofilm 3 5 label free quantitative proteomic profiling proteins are the products and functional units of the genome however the genome is not representative of protein levels because of the complex systems governing when and how much of a given protein should be present zhang et al 2019 hence further investigations on the metaproteome and its relationship with the metagenome in mbl mha mha and anaerobic ha were prompted by label free proteomic profiling four assays in phase ii i e mbl mha i mbl mha ii mha and anaerobic ha were analyzed a total of 456 768 secondary spectra were detected 22 801 peptides were matched and 22 801 peptide sequences and 7362 unique protein groups were identified in the four assays the number of proteins identified in each mbl mha i mha ii mha and anaerobic ha was 5157 5397 5232 and 5081 respectively quality assessment of the identified proteins revealed that the values data had good repeatability high quality and credibility in this study proteins were considered to be significantly differentially expressed table 3 compared with the proteins expressed in the anaerobic ha assay the number of upregulated proteins in samples mbl mha i mbl mha ii and mha amounted to 1508 1574 and 1504 respectively these results indicate that the addition of limited aeration in ha for the degradation of 2 4 dnp significantly affected the differential expression of functional proteins 3 5 1 gene ontology go functional annotation of upregulated proteins based on the go functional annotation of upregulated proteins as shown in fig 7 a the upregulated proteins of mbl mha i mbl mha ii and mha were associated with biological processes bp cell components cc and molecular functions mf compared with those in the assay anaerobic ha the upregulated proteins in the assays mbl mha i mbl mha ii and mha were classified into 24 functional groups 12 bp 2 cc 10 mf one protein may be involved in different bp and different proteins may be involved in the same process in the bp analysis against the assay anaerobic ha the majority of the upregulated proteins in the limited aeration assays were significantly assigned to the categories metabolic process interspecies interaction between organisms and cellular process p 0 05 and protein number 500 interspecies interactions can affect bacterial structure cell abundance and stress responses the enhanced interspecies interactions could display stronger stress tolerance rendering them substantially more robust for the treatment of toxic organic matter k w k lee et al 2014 the richfactor of interspecies interaction between organisms in the assay mbl mha ii was 0 99 and that in the assay mha and mbl mha i was 0 83 and 0 35 respectively indicating that compared with bubble micro aeration in ha the proteins with interspecies interactions could be more enhanced in membrane based bubbleless micro aeration in ha and this enhancement was primarily enriched in the biofilm according to the literature an obvious do gradient from the membrane biofilm to the bulk liquid and a rich microbial community structure in the biofilm could show an enhanced interspecies interaction x mei et al 2019 in addition the redox protein in eps could be the transient medium of interspecies interactions via its function of interspecific electron transfer xiao et al 2017 in this study the more abundant redox protein in tb eps in the biofilm on the membrane of mbl mha might promote this process more than mha these results implied one of the underlying reasons that using the membrane based bubbleless micro aeration into ha could enhance the degradation of 2 4 dnp even more than bubble micro aeration in the cc analysis most of the upregulated proteins in the micro aeration ha assays belonged to protein containing complex followed by cellular anatomical entity in the mf process most of the upregulated proteins in micro aeration ha were related to binding and catalytic activity functions the category catalytic activity included oxidoreductase activity acting on the choh aldehyde oxo nad p h chnh2 chch ch ch2 group of donors and hydrolase activity acting on acid anhydrides carbon nitrogen ester glycosyl acid halide and some transmembrane transporter activities zhang et al 2019 the richfactor of this activity function in the mbl mha ii assay was 0 94 which was higher than that of mha 0 62 and mbl mha i 0 55 these findings suggest that micro aeration ha could enhance the expression of proteins related to oxidoreductase activities ring cleavage and intermediate transmembrane processes for 2 4 dnp biodegradation better than anaerobic ha especially mbl mha 3 5 2 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg pathway annotation of upregulated proteins to further verify the metabolic and signaling pathways for the upregulated proteins in mbl mha and mha compared with those of anaerobic ha the identified proteins were annotated with kegg kegg pathway enrichment analysis further showed that limited aeration in ha enriched proteins was involved in various pathways such as nitrogen metabolism carbon metabolism glycolysis gluconeogenesis peroxisome oxidative phosphorylation and propanoate metabolism which are directly related to the efficiency of hydrolysis fermentation and 2 4 dnp degradation fig 7b a summary of significantly upregulated proteins p 0 05 and protein number 50 and their correlations with dominant bacterial species are shown in supporting information b the aforementioned results provide a general overview of the metabolic and signaling pathways of the upregulated proteins for 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha and mha compared with those in ha a detailed analysis based on the kegg pathway was subsequently conducted to improve the understanding of the process as shown in fig 7b compared with those of anaerobic ha protein active pathways for abc transporters oxidative phosphorylation quorum sensing qs biosynthesis of amino acids and nitrogen metabolism were significantly more abundant in sample mbl mha i and oxidative phosphorylation peroxisome nitrogen metabolism benzoate degradation and the citrate cycle i e tca cycle were more abundant in sample mbl mha ii p 0 05 and protein number 50 in addition protein active pathways for peroxisome nitrogen metabolism qs benzoate degradation and oxidative phosphorylation were more abundant in sample mha than in sample anaerobic ha p 0 05 and protein number 50 these abundant basic pathways in mbl mha and mha are primarily involved in for example organic matter metabolism bioenergy transmission and electron transfer for mbl mha nadh quinone oxidoreductase was the most significant oxidoreductase detected fold change 2 0 in the metaproteome of suspended sludge this oxidoreductase originated from the genera synergistales propionibacterium sp and deltaproteobacteria bacterium nadh quinone oxidoreductase activity has been well documented for nitro reduction processes under anaerobic conditions zhang et al 2019 in addition proteins for nitroreductase including nitroreductase family protein and nitrate reductase subunit beta which originated from the genera deltaproteobacteria and actinomycetales bacteria were also detected fold change 2 0 in the metagenome these proteins are involved in processes that can transfer nitro groups to amino groups huang et al 2012 accordingly in this study aminophenol intermediates with a structure similar to nitro reduction were identified in the analysis of metabolites by lc ms in mbl mha additionally abundant proteins for nadh quinone oxidoreductase and adenosine triphosphate atp synthase were detected fold change 2 50 in the biofilm metaproteome which originated from the gene brevundimonas diminuta according to the literature under the micro aeration condition as air or oxygen has negative charges air or oxygen could attract nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad transfer increasing the production of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh zhang et al 2021 thus to maintain redox balance nadh nad nadh can be regenerated through nadh quinone oxidoreductase which produces small amounts of atp kyzas et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 additionally nitrite reductase was detected fold change 2 50 in biofilms that originated from the genera propionibacterium sp and syntrophus sp ptab bin138 implying that nitrosation of ammonia nitrogen from suspended sludge occurred in the biofilm to generate nitrite and the generated nitrite underwent denitrification under micro aeration conditions x mei et al 2019 2020 the genes annotated to pyruvate ferredoxin flavodoxin oxidoreductase were mainly derived fold change 5 50 from cells of the genera propionibacterium sp genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase fold change 7 50 and acetate kinase fold change 142 97 from the genera propionibacterium sp and brevundimonas diminuta were significantly detected in the metagenome of the biofilm therefore 2 4 dnp was supposed to be degraded to aminophenol in suspended sludge and then further to pyruvate succinate and acetate and then to the tca metabolic process in the biofilm in mbl mha x mei et al 2019 khan et al 2019 ammonia nitrogen as a derivative of aminophenol degradation under micro aeration conditions could be oxidized to nitrite and then the generated nitrite underwent denitrification in the biofilm x mei et al 2019 2020 for the mha proteins for nadh quinone oxidoreductase in the detected metaproteome fold change 2 40 originated from the gene brevundimonas diminuta which was consistent with that in the biofilm of mbl mha indicating that these nadh quinone oxidoreductases might be primarily used to regenerate nadh rather than reduce nitro groups nitrite reductase was also detected fold change 2 00 which originated from the genera propionibacterium sp and actinomycetales bacterium however nitroreductase was not detected sufficiently in the metaproteome implying that the nitro groups of 2 4 dnp were directly removed in mha similar results have been reported by moreno et al 2012 and khan et al 2019 khan et al 2019 revealed that under micro aeration of 0 3 mg l into an anaerobic system 2 4 dnp was primarily degraded via the benzenethiol pathway to nitrite and benzenethiol the genes annotated to pyruvate ferredoxin flavodoxin oxidoreductase were mainly derived fold change 2 20 from cells of the genera propionibacterium sp genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase from the genera actinomycetales fold change 3 79 and propionibacterium sp fold change 10 28 were significantly detected in the metagenome therefore 2 4 dnp was supposed to be degraded via the benzenethiol pathway to nitrite and benzenethiol and then benzenethiol was degraded to pyruvate and succinate in mha additionally the protein active pathway for qs was improved under both micro aeration ha systems and these proteins were mainly involved in abc transporters supporting information b studies have reported that qs is related to the secretion of tb eps chen et al 2019 in this study more abundant tb eps was secreted in both micro aeration ha than that in ha these results might be the reason for the improved protein active pathway for qs under micro aeration conditions in further research the active pathway of qs proteins under micro aeration conditions should be further investigated 3 6 2 4 dnp degradation mechanisms in mbl mha and mha according to the aforementioned analysis results mbl mha exhibited higher 2 4 dnp degradation efficiency higher fermentation ability and more abundant biodiversity and richness than mha considering the analyses of degradation products eps microbial community and metaproteome the synergistic mechanisms responsible for the degradation of 2 4 dnp in mbl mha and mha are proposed in fig 8 the underlying reasons could be mainly attributed to the following aspects on one hand membrane based bubbleless micro aeration could exhibit higher oxygen transfer ability than bubble micro aeration which could augment the oxygen utilization capacity and metabolic rates of microorganisms zhang et al 2021 on the other hand the redox microenvironments caused by counter diffusion using membrane based bubbleless micro aeration were more beneficial for the degradation of 2 4 dnp than co diffusion using bubble micro aeration for mbl mha the microenvironments caused by counter diffusion were such that the surface layer of the biofilm and bulk liquid were anaerobic and the remaining biofilm was micro aerated 2 4 dnp could be degraded first by anaerobic degradation and then by microaerobic degradation briefly the corresponding aminophenols such as 2 a 4 np 2 n 4 ap and 2 4 dap are first formed through nitroreduction and then phenol is formed through deamination under anaerobic conditions jiang et al 2016 tang et al 2018 the reducing force could be formed by the expression of functional proteins such as oxidoreductase nadp dependent oxidoreductase and nitroreductase and transferred to redox proteins in eps which then drive nitroreduction and deamination to reduce 2 4 dnp additionally nitrosation of ammonia nitrogen from suspended sludge and the denitrification process could co occur in the biofilm under nitrite reductase subsequently phenol suffered from aromatic ring cleavage to succinate and then to acetate under micro aeration in the biofilm the oxidation force could be formed by the expression of functional proteins for example succinate dehydrogenase acetate kinase nadh quinone oxidoreductase and pyruvate oxidoreductase and transferred to redox proteins in tb eps which then drive the cleavage of the aromatic ring to produce acetate or some small molecules thus as more reducing and oxidizing forces became available to these reduction oxidation related interspecific electron transfer related and fermentative species in mbl mha the more effective 2 4 dnp degradation performance was obtained for mha the microenvironments caused by co diffusion were such that the surface layer of the suspended sludge and bulk liquid was microaerobic and the inside of the sludge was anaerobic 2 4 dnp could be degraded first by microaerobic degradation and then by anaerobic degradation briefly 2 4 dnp first suffered from bond cleavage between the nitro group and the aromatic ring through hydroxylation to produce nitrite and benzenethiol subsequently a small amount of benzenethiol suffered from cleavage of the aromatic ring to pyruvate and succinate in addition nitrite can be removed through denitrification processes the oxidizing and reducing forces could be formed by the expression of functional proteins for example succinate dehydrogenase acetate kinase nadh quinone oxidoreductase pyruvate oxidoreductase and transferred to redox proteins in eps which then drive the hydroxylation and nitro group removal from the benzene ring and denitrification generally denitration is the rate limiting step of 2 4 dnp degradation under certain amounts of oxygen because of its strong electron withdrawing property x mei et al 2019 and anaerobic reduction is conducive to its transformation to amino groups tang et al 2018 x mei et al 2019 additionally on the one hand the toxicity of the corresponding metabolites aminophenol was significantly lower than that of 2 4 dnp tang et al 2018 x mei et al 2019 and on the other hand aminophenol is more easily degraded under micro aeration than under anaerobic conditions x mei et al 2019 moreover the addition of trace oxygen in an anaerobic bioreactor as a terminal electron acceptor could accelerate the hydrolysis of long chain organic compounds under facultative bacteria improving the electron transfer activity of microbial metabolism botheju et al 2009 4 conclusion this comprehensive study examined 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha and compared it with that in mha and anaerobic ha the results showed that 2 4 dnp degradation could be stably enhanced in mbl mha and mha during the experiment especially in mbl mha 2 4 dnp degradation rates were 84 43 97 28 in mbl mha which was higher than the 82 41 94 71 in mha under the micro aeration of 0 5 5 0 ml air min these results were mainly due to the redox microenvironments caused by counter diffusion using membrane based bubbleless micro aeration were more suitable for 2 4 dnp degradation than co diffusion using bubble micro aeration the 2 4 dnp degradation pathways were nitroreduction deamination aromatic ring cleavage and fermentation in mbl mha and hydroxylation aromatic ring cleavage and fermentation in mha abundant reduction oxidation related interspecific electron transfer related and fermentative species were enriched in mbl mha the label free quantitative proteomic approach suggested that more reducing oxidizing forces formed by more redox proteins enzymes from these rich species could enhance 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha the observed efficient stable reactor performance demonstrated that this mbl mha offers substantial promise for the efficient treatment of wastewater containing nitrophenol pollutants in further research aspects of the fate of mbl mha that should be further explored are influent factors treatment of actual wastewater containing nitrophenol and development of new economical microaerobic membrane materials credit authorship contribution statement zhuowei zhang methodology formal analysis writing

16275,micro aeration hydrolysis acidification ha is an effective method to enhance the removal of toxic and refractory organic matter but the difficulty in stable dosing control of trace oxygen limits its wide application membrane based bubbleless aeration has been proved as an ideal aeration method because of its higher oxygen transfer rate more uniform mass transfer and lower cost than ha however the available information on its application in ha is limited in this study membrane based bubbleless micro aeration coupled with hydrolysis acidification mbl mha was exploited to investigate the performance of 2 4 dinitrophenol 2 4 dnp degradation via comparing it with bubble micro aeration ha mha and anaerobic ha the results indicated that the performances in mbl mha and mha were higher than those in ha during the experiment 2 4 dnp degradation rates under redox microenvironments caused by counter diffusion in mbl mha 84 43 97 28 were higher than those caused by co diffusion in mha 82 41 94 71 under micro aeration of 0 5 5 0 ml air min the 2 4 dnp degradation pathways in mbl mha were nitroreduction deamination aromatic ring cleavage and fermentation while those in mha were hydroxylation aromatic ring cleavage and fermentation reduction oxidation related interspecific electron transfer related species and fermentative species in mbl mha were more abundant than that in mha ultimately more reducing oxidizing forces formed by more redox proteins enzymes from these rich species could enhance 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha graphical abstract graphical abstract image

substance eps redox protein 1 introduction nitrophenols have been extensively used as essential raw materials for dyes plasticizers pesticides herbicides paints pharmaceuticals explosives and leather preservatives in the global chemical industry wu et al 2015 fajardo et al 2015 arora et al 2014 among the nitrophenols 2 4 dinitrophenol 2 4 dnp a representative nitrophenol has been ranked as a priority controlled pollutant by the united states environmental protection agency 2003 and must be appropriately treated because of its high toxicity oncogenicity and biological accumulation sasidharan pillai et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 several methods to treat 2 4 dnp containing wastewater via physicochemical treatment processes for example adsorption methods azari et al 2021 advanced reduction yang et al 2011 advanced oxidization hedayat et al 2018 and various other methods xiong et al 2019 have been investigated in the literature although they have achieved remarkable effects these methods have disadvantages such as the necessity to recycle chemicals the complex processes involved the high cost and the resultant secondary pollution naidu et al 2016 therefore in recent decades biological treatment methods have been widely used because of their high degradation efficiency and uncomplicated treatment or extraction processes hydrolytic acidification ha is an effective economical biotreatment method that plays a crucial role in changing refractory complex macromolecules such as aromatic hydrocarbons or heterocyclic substances into small molecules such as small molecule organic acids and alcohols and improving biodegradability via biological hydrolysis and acid production g song et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 therefore ha has been widely used to treat wastewater containing refractory and toxic organic matter g song et al 2017 however the hydrolysis of complex organic matter in the ha process is usually a rate limiting step song et al 2019 wu et al 2019 to solve this problem the literature has proposed new methods for enhancing hydrolysis efficiencies recently studies have reported that micro aeration dosing tract air or oxygen also known as limited aeration is an effective method to accelerate the hydrolysis of complex organic matter improve volatile fatty acid vfa production and increase biodegradability nguyen et al 2019 song et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 in general a dissolved oxygen do concentration in the range of 0 1 0 5 mg l corresponding to the oxidation reduction potential orp value of 300 0 mv can be defined as a micro aeration environment wu et al 2019 nguyen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 studies have reported that micro aeration ha enhances the hydrolysis of various refractory organic matter in wastewater such as nitrophenol benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene btex aniline and aldehydes compounds cheng et al 2015 firmino et al 2017 joão et al 2018 khan et al 2019 song et al 2019 for example khan et al 2019 reported that under 4 nitrophenol 4 np of 100 mg l in the influent the 4 np degradation rate reached 99 89 under micro aeration conditions do 0 5 mg l and it was only 4 under anaerobic conditions do 0 mg l joão et al 2018 demonstrated that under the conditions from the anaerobic to the micro aeration of 1 0 ml air min the removal rates of benzene and toluene increased from 55 to 67 and from 84 to 89 respectively the aniline removal rate reached up to 91 2 2 2 under micro aeration of 0 31 0 17 mg l and it was 15 8 1 1 without micro aeration cheng et al 2015 the phenol removal rate reached 80 7 in the micro aerated condition do 0 41 mg l and was 11 6 under anaerobic conditions yang et al 2018 nevertheless the stable dosing and precise control of trace oxygen is difficult which has limited the application of limited aeration as an effective operational strategy in ha kong et al 2019 nguyen et al 2019 for the stable dosing of trace oxygen in ha a suitable micro aeration dosing method should be established because it could affect the oxygen transfer rate otr and oxygen transfer efficiency by affecting the bubble size zhang et al 2021 micro aeration dosing methods usually include limited aeration hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and electrolysis wu et al 2018 tartakovsky et al 2003 2011 although some chemical oxidants such as h2o2 and calcium peroxide can release peroxides by reacting with water to elevate o2 levels they can also kill microorganisms and pollute aquatic ecosystems d wang et al 2019 limited aeration would be more promising than chemical oxidants because it could be nontoxic and without chemical additives especially for the enhancement of the ha process to fulfill the sustainable development goals generally under limited aeration the smaller bubble size the higher otr and the lower costs resulting from higher interfacial areas lower rise velocities stronger stability and higher gas utilization h wang et al 2020 john et al 2020 temesgen et al 2017 reported that the otr of nanobubbles diameter 1 μm was 125 times faster than that of bulk bubbles diameter 1000 nm john et al 2020 investigated the effect of limited aeration with nanobubbles and bulk bubbles into ha on cellulose degradation the results demonstrated that under the nanobubble micro aeration addition the reductions in cellulose content and cellulose crystallinity increased by 8 14 and 9 21 respectively in comparison with the bulk bubble micro aeration in recent years hydrophobic membranes such as silicone tubes polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and polypropylene membranes have proved ideal for injecting oxygen for efficient gas transfer unlike bubble aeration pressurized gas diffuses into the solution through the membrane module without forming bubbles achieving an approximately 100 higher otr more uniform mass transfer a lower supply pressure and a lower cost than bubble aeration aybar et al 2014 perez calleja et al 2017 hou et al 2019 the membranes can also serve as microorganism carriers facilitate abundant microorganisms to colonize the rough membrane surface and form biofilms kinh et al 2017 these biofilms consist of a stratified community embedded within a tight self produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps pellicer nacher et al 2014 which are highly resistant to toxicity and load shock li et al 2015 membrane based bubbleless aeration as an oxygen dosing method has been applied in activated sludge systems and mainly focused on simultaneous nitrification and denitrification hydrogen sulfide and organic matter removal wang et al 2009 sun et al 2016 x mei et al 2019 however the literature is limited on the coupling of the membrane based bubbleless micro aeration in ha for degrading toxic and refractory organic matters to nontoxic or low toxicity small molecular organic matters and ensuring the subsequent biodegradability rather than for removing chemical oxygen demand cod what might be feasible is to create a more stable and uniform micro aeration environment through the coupling of membrane based bubbleless micro aeration in ha however few attempts have been reported notably under the membrane based bubbleless micro aeration addition the supplied oxygen diffusion could be from the base of the biofilm to the bulk liquid and the supplied substrate diffusion could be from the bulk liquid to the base of the biofilm counter diffusion under the bubble micro aeration addition both supplied oxygen and substrate diffusion could be from the bulk liquid to the surface of the suspended sludge co diffusion wang et al 2009 as a result the microbial community structure could have different spatial microstructures between the two aeration methods caused by counter and co diffusion such as aerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones from the base of the biofilm to the bulk liquid for bubbleless aeration x mei et al 2019 and anaerobic anoxic and aerobic zones from the center of the suspended sludge to the bulk liquid for bubble aeration nguyen et al 2019 this opposite do spatial microstructure caused by counter and co diffusion might lead to different pollutant degradation effects according to the literature degradation products produced by 2 4 dnp differ under anaerobic and micro aeration conditions for example under anaerobic conditions degradation products of 2 4 dnp have been proven to be corresponding amino phenols namely 2 4 diaminophenol 2 4 dap 2 amino 4 nitrophenol 2 a 4 np and 2 nitro 4 aminophenol 2 n 4 ap kimura et al 2003 tang et al 2018 and under oxygen containing conditions nitro groups of 2 4 dnp could be released from the benzene ring and benzenethiol could be generated in which oxygenases play a major role x mei et al 2019 hence the degradation effects of 2 4 dnp might be different using the bubble and membrane based bubbleless limited aeration into ha due to the opposite do spatial microstructure however to date the effects of bubble and membrane based bubbleless micro aeration on 2 4 dnp degradation in ha have rarely been documented limited insights into the effects of limited aeration on the degradation pathways of 2 4 dnp and the molecular mechanisms of microbial community and microbiome protein expression have been reported thus far therefore in this study a membrane based bubbleless micro aeration coupled with the ha mbl mha process was exploited for 2 4 dnp degradation for the precise control of micro aeration mbl mha was equipped with an automatic temperature control system and a do online automatic monitoring system which was integrated into a programmable logic controller plc system it was operated continuously for 100 days to investigate the performance of 2 4 dnp degradation by comparing it with that of bubble micro aeration ha mha and anaerobic ha and the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the performance of 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha and mha under different limited aeration rates ii investigate the degradation pathways of 2 4 dnp in the mbl mha and mha systems and iii reveal the synergistic effects of 2 4 dnp degradation the microbial community and microbiomes protein expression in mbl mha and mha 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated wastewater and inoculum the three bioreactors were fed simulated wastewater the specific characteristics of the simulated wastewater were found as follows nh4cl of 191 4 mg l kh2po4 of 60 mg l mgcl2 6h2o of 200 mg l feso4 7h2o of 25 mg l cuso4 5h2o of 5 mg l cocl2 5h2o of 0 125 mg l mnso4 6h2o of 15 mg l and nahco3 of 1800 mg l zhang et al 2019 and ph was 7 1 7 4 generally the 2 4 dnp concentration was 2 120 mg l in actual industrial wastewater wu et al 2015 chen et al 2013 therefore glucose was used as the primary organic carbon source at a cod

trace mass gas flowmeter horiba s49 33 mt china the do concentration was measured using an automatically monitored online system inesa sjg 9435b china to avoid the do probe surface by air or oxygen bubble adsorption which affects the monitoring accuracy do was monitored at the ectopic site in these bioreactors the do monitoring probe was outside the reactor and the mixed liquid in the reactor flowed through the do monitoring probe in the form of uniform turbulent flow to achieve do monitoring the automatic temperature control system trace mass gas flowmeter and do were automatically monitored online and controlled using a plc system siemens germany the specific process was as follows the do online monitoring probe was immersed in the flow cup the mixture in the reactor continuously and stably flowed into the flow cup from the bottom through a peristaltic pump and then flowed out to the secondary sedimentation tank through overflow in the flow cup the entire process was conducted under sealed conditions a schematic of the circulation cup structure is shown in fig s1 when the air pressure was below the membrane bubble point pressure its bubbleless aeration could form achieving an approximately 100 higher otr more uniform mass transfer a lower supply pressure and a lower cost than bubble aeration aybar et al 2014 perez calleja et al 2017 hou et al 2019 it is therefore necessary to determine the membrane bubble point pressure the specific determination steps were based on those in the literature wu et al 2019 the membrane module was completely immersed in water with one end connected to a sterile pressurized air bottle and the other end sealed then a trace mass gas flowmeter was switched on to control the air flow rate the bubble point was the pressure in the membrane s inner lumen when the first bubble began to appear on the membrane s surface the performance of 2 4 dnp degradation in the three bioreactors under different limited aeration

tian et al 2020 dna was extracted from sludge samples using the tiangen soil dna kit tiangen biotech china by following the manufacturer s protocol the extracts were stored at 20 c until further analysis the v3 v4 regions of the 16 s rdna genes were amplified with 340 f cctacgggnbgcascag and 805r gactacnvgggtatctaatcc all polymerase chain reaction mixtures were purified using minelute gel extraction kit qiagen germany the invitrogen qubit fluorometer quantitative system california usa was used to quantify the amplicons high throughput sequencing of 16s dna amplicons was performed using the illumina miseq platform at sinogenomax co ltd beijing china 2 5 label free quantitative proteomic profiling four samples mbl mha i mbl mha ii mha and anaerobic ha were selected for further analysis by label free quantitative proteomics the operation process referred to the literature zhang et al 2019 2020 the detailed information is provided in the supporting information a text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of bioreactors under different air flow rates during each phase mbl mha mha and anaerobic ha air flow rate of 0 ml min were gradually stabilized after continuous running for one month these reactors were run continuously for 100 days from phase i to phase iii to investigate the performance of 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha and mha by setting the micro aeration rate from 0 to 5 0 ml min fig 2 as shown in fig 2 in phase i the removal rates of 2 4 dnp cod tn and uv254 in the micro aeration ha mbl mha and mha at an air flow rate of 0 5 ml min were obviously higher than that in the anaerobic ha ad and effluent our were significantly increased in mbl mha and mha but not in anaerobic ha these results indicate that limited aeration into ha could result in an enhanced 2 4 dnp removal rate and acid production additionally with an increasing air flow rate from 0 5 to 3 0 ml min the 2 4 dnp removal rates in mbl mha and mha ranged from 84 32 1 90 to 97 28 0 51 and from 82 41 0 43 to 94 71 0 35 respectively the cod and tn removal rates also increased from 55 42 1 11 to 68 13 1 24 and from 42 21 1 11 to 51 87 0 87 in mbl mha from 54 31 0 46 to 65 32 0 94 and from 39 43 0 35 to 45 69 0 73 in mha respectively when the air flow rate was from 0 5 to 3 0 ml min under the uv254 value of 0 65 0 02 in the influent uv254 values in the effluent also obviously decreased from 0 12 0 02 to 0 04 0 01 in mbl mha and from 0 15 0 02 to 0 07 0 01 in mha the lower uv254 values the lower aromatic constituents in the wastewater wan et al 2020 these results demonstrated that at an air flow rate of 3 0 l min the aromatic constituent in the effluent of the micro aeration ha effluent was lower than that at an air flow rate of 0 5 ml min the high aromatic constituent uv254 value in the influent was mainly contributed to the 2 4 dnp existed in the influent in the two micro aeration ha systems at an air flow rate of 3 0 l min 2 4 dnp degradation rates 97 28 0 51 of mbl mha and 94 71 0 35 of mha were higher than the uv254 removal rates 93 85 0 18 of mbl mha and 89 23 0 21 of mha indicating that the degradation intermediates of 2 4 dnp might contain aromatic organics and could mainly contribute to the effluent aromatic constituent as a result the lower uv254 values in the effluent of the two micro aeration ha systems at an air flow rate of 3 0 l min were compared with those of 0 5 ml min and indicated that the content of aromatic organics from the degradation intermediates of 2 4 dnp of 3 0 l min was lower than that of 0 5 ml min and that 2 4 dnp could be degraded even more thoroughly than in the literature additionally effluent ad at an air flow rate of 3 0 ml min was significantly increased to 78 48 1 51 in mbl mha and 74 58 1 72 in mha and it was 73 21 1 33 in mbl mha and 68 73 1 51 in mha at an air flow rate of 0 5 ml min indicating that limited aeration 3 0 ml min could improve vfa production vfas can serve as organic carbon sources to accelerate the removal of biological nutrients and improve the biodegradability of wastewater w s lee et al 2014 additionally under an air flow rate from 0 5 ml min to 3 0 ml min effluent our values also obviously improved from 14 82 0 41 mg o2 g mlss h to 18 42 0 31 mg o2 g mlss h in mbl mha and from 13 34 0 53 mg o2 g mlss h to 15 84 0 52 mg o2 g mlss h in mha respectively these results indicated that the inhibitory effect of the influent containing toxic 2 4 dnp on activated sludge decreased obviously through the treatment of micro aeration ha the limited aeration 3 0 ml min into ha can enhance the treatability of the wastewater containing toxic 2 4 dnp and the effluent is more suitable for the following aerobic biological treatment processes firmo et al 2018 reported that under the btex of 3 mg l in the influent when the air flow rate was 0 5 ml min the micro aeration ha assured high removal efficiencies 80 for all compounds of btex joão et al 2018 reported that benzene exhibited a 30 increase in its removal efficiency under a flow rate of 1 0 ml air min in the micro aeration ha a trace amount of oxygen in ha could increase the number of oxygenases to improve the removal of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds e g btex and nitrophenol wu et al 2015 2018 in this study the optimum air flow rate was 3 0 ml min which was inconsistent with the literature this result might be attributed to the optimum do concentration being related to the type and concentration of the substance hence the effects of organic load rates on the performance of mbl mha for the treatment of 2 4 dnp should be investigated however with a further increase in the air flow rate to 5 0 ml min the 2 4 dnp tn and uv254 removal rates and effluent our decreased in mbl mha and mha the deterioration of 2 4 dnp degradation when applying more air could be attributed to the following under excessive oxygen 2 4 dnp could not be easily degraded because of its chemical structures with electron absorbing nitro groups and negatively charged benzene rings zhang et al 2021 in addition the biomass of the biofilm on the membrane surface in phase i iii were 20 98 0 46 g m2 25 85 0 29 g m2 and 23 91 0 62 g m2 which demonstrated that the appropriate air flow rate could promote the growth of microorganisms on the membrane surface while excessive oxygen might destroy the micro aeration environment and reduce the biomass on the membrane surface notably ad decreased to 61 45 2 32 in mbl mha and 58 32 1 28 in mha and the cod removal rates obviously increased to 78 36 1 45 in mbl mha and 76 82 1 12 in mha similar results have been reported mozo et al 2011 wu et al 2015 for example wu et al 2015 reported that with a further increase in do from 0 3 to 0 4 mg l to 0 4 0 5 mg l for the pretreatment of petrochemical wastewater in ha vfa production decreased from 1 68 mg l to 1 01 mg l the bod5 cod ratio of the effluent decreased significantly from 0 31 to 0 20 and the cod removal rate increased from 24 9 to 31 6 these results were mainly attributed to the following vfas can be oxidized by excess oxygen when applying more air the 2 4 dnp degradation and fermentation ability could be enhanced in the micro aeration ha system when applying a suitable limited aeration 3 0 ml min into the ha however a much higher limited aeration would result in a negative effect on reactor performance in the micro aeration ha in this study 2 4 dnp degradation efficiency using the micro aeration ha at phase ii was higher than the reports in the literature for 2 4 dnp degradation using an anaerobic biological process for example dai et al 2009 reported that under 2 4 dnp of 0 25 mmol l in wastewater the 2 4 dnp degradation rate was 75 28 after adding nadh in an anaerobic biological process she et al 2005 reported that under 2 4 dnp of 2 45 mg l in wastewater the 2 4 dnp degradation rate was 10 65 1 in an anaerobic digestion process as indicated in the literature in the presence of low oxygen concentrations microbial activity can be improved nguyen et al 2019 and the amount of mono oxygenases can be increased to improve the removal of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds e g nitrophenol varjani 2017 additionally the addition of trace oxygen in an ha as a terminal electron acceptor could accelerate the hydrolysis of long chain organic compounds under facultative bacteria promoting 2 4 dnp transformation zhang et al 2021 however when the applied limited aeration was too high such as 5 0 ml min in this study the oxygen might be excessive in the reactor which could cause the deterioration of 2 4 dnp degradation and oxidization of vfas wu et al 2015 moreover the 2 4 dnp and uv254 degradation rates and effluent ad and our in the mbl mha were significantly higher than those in the mha these results demonstrated that membrane based bubbleless limited aeration into ha could augment 2 4 dnp degradation and fermentation ability even more than that with bubble micro aeration into ha in addition the bubble size and aeration intensity not only influence the shear force on sludge and biofilm but also affect the oxygen diffusion efficiency in bulk liquid sludge and biofilm inside zhao et al 2021 li et al 2004 resulting in different chemical changes e g oxygen and redox potential and spatial stratification inside sludge and biofilm li et al 2004 the performance of the bioreactor could be affected by microenvironments with different chemical changes and spatial stratifications inside sludge and biofilm li et al 2004 the do and orp were measured by microelectrodes to profile the microenvironment of the biofilm in mbl mha and the suspended sludge in mha under different limited aeration conditions fig 3 three to five biofilm samples from mbl mha and suspended sludge samples from mha were tested the diameters of the suspended sludge used in this study were determined to be 1 0 1 5 mm suspended sludge smaller than 1 0 mm could not be sufficiently stabilized in the batch reactor for accurate microelectrode measurements additionally the 1 0 1 5 mm depths of the biofilm was also determined for accurate microelectrode measurements an obviously chemically heterogeneous microstructure was detected in the biofilm and suspended sludge under different limited aeration conditions for example for mbl mha the counter diffusion direction between do and 2 4 dnp is shown during phase i do inside the biofilm increased from 0 mg l at the top 0 4 mm of the biofilm to 0 084 0 004 mg l of membrane biofilm interface biofilm depth 0 μm and the corresponding orp values increased from 289 34 0 35 mv to 119 27 0 21 mv in phase ii do began to increase from the top 1 3 mm of the biofilm 0 mg l and reached 0 28 0 003 mg l on the membrane biofilm interface the corresponding orp values increased from 276 23 0 26 mv to 75 84 0 18 mv in phase iii do increased from 0 12 0 018 mg l at the top 0 8 mm of the biofilm to 0 39 0 015 mg l of membrane biofilm interface and the corresponding orp values increased from 104 26 0 18 mv to 67 39 0 21 mv in phase ii the anaerobic zone was thus limited to the surface layer of the biofilm and bulk liquid and the remaining biofilm was micro aerated in mbl mha a biofilm stratification structure and a significant change in redox status resulting from a single do gradient in phase ii was more obvious than that in phases i and iii for mha the co diffusion direction between do and 2 4 dnp is shown for example during phase i do was approximately 0 06 0 017 mg l in the bulk liquid and do inside the suspend sludge was depleted in the top 1 0 mm of the sludge and the corresponding orp values decreased from 139 47 0 22 mv to 291 29 0 28 mv during phase ii do decreased from 0 23 0 035 mg l in the bulk liquid to 0 mg l in the top 1 2 mm in the center of the sludge according to the decreasing orp values from 79 49 0 28 mv to 279 29 0 28 mv in phase iii do decreased from 0 36 0 032 mg l in the bulk liquid to 0 21 0 017 mg l in the center of the sludge according to the increasing orp values from 64 24 0 37 mv to 81 25 0 19 mv in phase ii the micro aeration zone was thus limited to the surface layer of the suspended sludge and bulk liquid and the remaining sludge was anaerobic a more obvious sludge stratification structure resulting from a single do gradient in phase ii was also achieved in mha compared with that in phases i and iii in addition because of the opposite diffusion direction of do between mbl mha counter diffusion and mha co diffusion the redox microenvironments during the degradation of 2 4 dnp were also opposite for mbl mha because the surface layer of the biofilm and bulk liquid were anaerobic and the remaining biofilm was micro aerated 2 4 dnp could be degraded first by anaerobic degradation on the surface layer of the biofilm and suspended sludge and then by microaerobic degradation in the biofilm for mha because the surface layer of the suspended sludge and bulk liquid was microaerobic and the inside of the sludge was anaerobic 2 4 dnp could be degraded first by microaerobic degradation on the surface layer of the suspended sludge and bulk liquid and then by anaerobic degradation inside the sludge to measure and compare the conversion rates in mbl mha and mha systems oxygen fluxes at different volumetric locations inside the biofilm and suspended sludge samples were calculated based on our microelectrode measurements table 1 tab one showed that oxygen fluxes inside the samples from the two micro aeration ha systems in phase ii were higher than those in phases i and iii and under the same limited aeration conditions those in mbl mha were also higher than those in the mha these oxygen flux results were lower than those reported for sludge li et al 2004 a possible reason for this difference is that the do in this study was below 0 5 mg l which was much lower than the do saturated water used in other studies the literature reported that under high aeration conditions the oxygen flux measured by a cathodically polarized oxygen microelectrode was higher than the true oxygen flux perhaps caused by ignoring the possible influence of convective mass transport and oxygen consumption inside the biofilm and the standard variation was higher than when a lower do was used li et al 2004 some studies have reported that a higher oxygen flux confirmed a higher oxygen utilization capacity and metabolic rates of microorganisms schramm et al 1996 li et al 2004 additionally diffusion resistance is one of the main factors influencing oxygen flux and oxygen bubble size is one of the main factors influencing diffusion resistance li et al 2004 generally the oxygen transfer coefficient kla h 1 has been used to evaluate diffusion resistance x mei et al 2019 coefficients of bubble and membrane based bubbleless micro aeration in clean water were investigated tab s3 the kla values of the bubbleless limited aeration were 1 23 1 74 h 1 under different operational conditions which was higher than those of the bubble limited aeration which were 0 88 1 22 h 1 wu et al 2019 reported similar results that is kla values increased from 1 33 h 1 to 1 42 h 1 when the bubble size of aeration decreased from 0 16 μm to 0 10 μm these results demonstrated that the oxygen utilization capacity and metabolic rates of microorganisms could be enhanced compared with those of bubble limited aeration because of the higher oxygen transfer ability of the membrane based bubbleless limited aeration 3 2 metabolites of 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha and mha in most cases even when the parent compound is completely degraded some intermediate products remain in the water environment li et al 2021 tang et al 2018 investigated the degradation products of 2 4 dnp under anoxic conditions and found that 2 4 dap 2 a 4 np 2 n 4 ap phenol and small molecule acids were produced under anoxic conditions in this study six main intermediate products were detected by lc ms in mbl mha 2 4 dap 2 a 4 np 2 n 4 ap 2 np 4 np phenol and benzoic acid fig s3 and 4 nitrocatechol 2 nitrohydroquinone and benzenethiol were mainly detected by lc ms in mha fig s3 these intermediate products were different between mbl mha and mha indicating that the degradation pathways of 2 4 dnp might be different to analyze the denitration characteristics of 2 4 dnp in the mbl mha and mha systems this study investigated nitrogen transformations within a given hrt by using the batch reaction mode under phase ii fig s4 the nh4 n concentration increased rapidly and then decreased in mbl mha and it remained relatively stable close to zero in the mha for mbl mha the nitro groups on the benzene ring were first reduced to amino groups generating the corresponding aminophenols such as 2 4 dap 2 a 4 np and 2 n 4 ap in addition the nh4 n concentration decreased rapidly and the no2 n concentration increased rapidly and then decreased indicating that nitrosification and denitrification might occur simultaneously in mbl mha nh4 n could be conversed to no2 n at do of 0 2 0 4 mg l wang et al 2009 for mha the no2 n concentration increased more rapidly than in mbl mha probably because of the accumulation of no2 n caused by the shedding of nitro groups in addition the no2 n concentration generally decreased indicating that denitrification might have occurred in mha based on the properties of 2 4 dnp and the products detected from lc ms the possible pathways of 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha were nitroreduction deamination from the benzene ring and simultaneous nitrosification and denitrification and the possible pathways in mha were hydroxylation nitro group removal from the benzene ring and denitrification fig 4 these results were due to the counter diffusion in mbl mha and co diffusion in mha which might lead to different degradation pathways of 2 4 dnp in mbl mha 2 4 dnp could be transferred first to the corresponding aminophenol such as 2 a 4 np 2 n 4 ap and 2 4 dap in the suspended sludge and the surface layer of the biofilm through the nitroreduction process under anaerobic conditions jiang et al 2016 next the corresponding aminophenol could be further degraded to phenol through the deamination process tang et al 2018 in addition phenol could be degraded to benzoic acid and then to acetate under micro aeration in the biofilm in mha hydroxylation and denitration of 2 4 dnp could occur on the outer layer of the suspended sludge under micro aeration and nitrite and benzenethiol were produced subsequently nitrite can be removed through the denitrification process 3 3 variations of eps fig 5 a and 5 b show the variations in the lb eps and tb eps contents polysaccharide protein and nucleic acid of mbl mha and mha under different limited aeration conditions and anaerobic ha fig 5 a and 5 b show that protein content was more dominant than polysaccharide and nucleic acid contents in eps production in the three systems the protein content in phase ii was higher than that in phases i and iii and that in biofilms in mbl mha was higher than that in suspended sludge in mbl mha and mha the protein of eps is mainly related to extracellular enzymes or structural proteins tian et al 2021 extracellular enzymes could be important for capturing or adhering to water soluble and water insoluble organic compounds in the matrix providing nutrients for the microbe growth and promoting the transformation of organic matter structural proteins non enzymatic proteins are the main components of eps proteins such as cell surface binding and extracellular carbohydrate binding proteins appropriate limited aeration into ha could promote various extracellular enzyme activities ruan et al 2019 which could be one of the main reasons for the increased protein content of eps in phase ii additionally zhang et al 2015 reported that compared with that in suspended sludge eps protein in biofilms also contained more structural proteins to promote cell adhesion the eps protein could also affect the morphologies of sludge and biofilm chen et al 2021 the morphologies of suspended sludge of mbl mha biofilm on the membrane surface of mbl mha and suspended sludges of mha and anaerobic ha during stable operation in phase ii were observed through sem in fig s7 from fig s7 the rod shaped bacteria and spheroidal bacteria were dominant under micro aeration and the suspended sludge under micro aeration was more dense than that in ha meanwhile a certain thickness of biofilm was uniformly attached to the membrane surface and the structure of biofilm was more dense than the suspended sludge moreover the protein content of tb eps was higher than that of lb eps in the four samples similar results have been reported by ye et al 2011 and zhang et al 2014 these results might occur because the compositions and properties of lb eps are unstable and easily influenced by external conditions by contrast the stable composition and function of tb eps are less affected by the environment ye et al 2011 studies have reported that tb eps have strong biosorption ability and their functional groups play a significant role in the biosorption of suspended sludge and biofilms gao et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 the 3d eem spectroscopy and parafac methods have been proved to be appropriate methods for eps analysis sheng and yu 2006 thus they were also used in this study for eps analysis the parafac models of tb eps and lb eps in the four samples with different micro aeration conditions revealed that the fluorescence could be characterized by four components fig 5 c component 1 resembled the tryptophan like protein ex em 225 350 nm and soluble microbial byproduct like matter ex em 275 350 nm chen et al 2003 component 2 mainly showed tyrosine like fluorescence ex em 220 300 nm chen et al 2003 guo et al 2012 components 1 and 2 have been ascribed to protein like fluorophores baghoth et al 2011 component 3 exhibited fmax at ex em wavelengths of 265 475 nm and 425 475 nm which are associated with humic acid like fluorescence chen et al 2003 component 4 mainly showed fulvic acid like fluorescence ex em 220 300 nm chen et al 2003 parafac analysis also provided quantitative information based on the fmax values of the four components in the lb eps and tb eps samples under varying micro aeration conditions fig 5 d e the protein like substances components 1 and 2 were major constituents in the lb eps and tb eps samples and those in the tb eps were higher than those in the lb eps the fmax of components 1 and 2 in tb eps in phase ii was higher than that in phases i and iii and that in the biofilm in mbl mha was higher than that in suspended sludge in mbl mha and mha which indicated that there were more abundant tyrosine like and tryptophan like protein substances in tb eps in phase ii and in the biofilm in mbl mha these results were consistent with the protein content in the tb eps samples during phases i iii the increased fmax of protein like substances in tb eps in phase ii demonstrated that it played a certain role in organic matter removal and transformation in the biosorption process song et al 2019 aquino et al 2004 investigated the interaction between protein like substances in eps and chloroform indicating that the interaction increased as the amount of protein like substances increased to further investigate the changes in the chemical structures and functionalities of eps in mbl mha mha and anaerobic ha uv vis and ft ir qualitative spectra of lb eps and tb eps from biofilm in the mbl mha and suspended sludge in the mbl mha and mha were used in phase ii fig s5 and s6 fig s5 shows that there was a weak absorption peak at 275 nm in lb eps and tb eps in the three systems the uv vis absorption peaks of aromatic proteins in eps generally range from 245 nm to 290 nm which belong to the n π and π π electron transfer of the c o and c c groups from tryptophan and tyrosine he et al 2020 the absorbance of mbl mha ii was lower than that of mha and anaerobic ha and the protein content in tb eps of mbl mha ii was higher than that of mha and anaerobic ha indicating that stronger interactions among tb eps 2 4 dnp and its transformation products might occur in the biofilm he et al 2020 a general belief is that the 1800 600 cm 1 region of the ft ir spectra can provide information on the compositions chemical structures and functionalities of eps components badireddy et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 fig s6 shows the ft ir qualitative spectra of lb eps and tb eps which mainly included six predominant peaks associated with several characteristic functional groups in general the ft ir profiles for mbl mha mha and ha were similar indicating that the main functional groups were similar for these epss the peaks at 1650 cm 1 1525 cm 1 and 1425 cm 1 were assigned to the c o stretching vibration of the amide i n h deformation vibration of amide ii and the c n stretching vibration of amide iii respectively badireddy et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 the band at 1100 cm 1 was related to the c o c and c h stretching vibrations of the polysaccharide structures wang et al 2012 the band at 1100 cm 1 may also be associated with the p o and c p o vibrations badireddy et al 2010 fang et al 2012 these results indicated that extracellular proteins could bind or mix carbohydrates and phosphorylated macromolecules the ranges of 600 900 cm 1 belonged to the fingerprint region which mainly reflects the presence of carbohydrates and nucleic acids badireddy et al 2010 yin et al 2015 the ft ir spectra showed that the eps contained proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids and other substances which was consistent with the composition of eps according to the literature zhang et al 2019 extracellular enzymes with oxidoreductase activity in eps in ha generally act on the choh chch ch ch2 group of donors and those with hydrolase activity generally act on cn in addition redox active oxygen containing functional groups such as c o can facilitate microbial reduction of organic matter wu et al 2017 ren et al 2020 revealed that surface oxygen containing functional groups of hydrochar could mediate direct interspecies electron transfer in an anaerobic digestion system xiao et al 2017 reported that redox proteins in eps could be the transient media of interspecies interactions through its function of interspecific electron transfer to promote the removal of organic matter these peaks of redox active functional groups in tb eps in ft ir were stronger than those in lb eps and those of biofilm in mbl mha was stronger than that of suspended sludge in mha and anaerobic ha indicating a greater abundance of redox proteins with oxidoreductase activity in the biofilm of the mbl mha 3 4 microbial community analysis illumina miseq high throughput sequencing was used to reveal the microbial community structure of the different sludge samples the community richness and alpha diversity indices of the samples are shown in table 2 the coverage of each sample was 0 999 indicating that the sequence analysis represented an almost complete microbial population the ace and chao indices indicate microbial community richness and the shannon and simpson indices represent microbial community diversity jena et al 2016 the observed ace and chao indices in the samples from mbl mha and mha were higher than those from anaerobic ha indicating that the microbial community became relatively more diverse under micro aeration conditions additionally shannon indices in the samples from mbl mha and mha were higher than those from anaerobic ha and simpson indices in the samples from mbl mha and mha were closer to 0 than those from anaerobic ha indicating that the microbial community was richer under micro aeration conditions these results indicate that suitable limited aeration in ha could increase microbial community richness and diversity this result is similar to that reported nguyen et al 2019 krayzelova et al 2015 notably the samples from mbl mha ii showed a higher diversity shannon index of 4 32 simpson index of 0 042 and richness ace index of 621 chao index of 603 than those from mha shannon index of 4 11 simpson index of 0 048 ace index of 609 chao index of 593 indicating that the microbial community richness and diversity became relatively richer under the membrane based bubbleless micro aeration in ha than that under the bubble micro aeration in ha high biodiversity and richness can increase ecological stability which would result in a high capacity to resist environmental stress zhang et al 2013 the venn diagram of these samples fig 5 c shows that the otus shared by mbl mha i mbl mha ii mha and anaerobic ha accounted for 23 of the total otus and the number of unique otus was 46 113 93 and 62 respectively according to the results of the biofilm microenvironment fig 3 the microbial community structures from the membrane biofilm interface biofilm depth 0 μm to bulk liquid were divided into more obvious micro aeration and anaerobic zones which resulted in increased greater biodiversity and explain why the otu number of mbl mha ii was higher than that of mha ma et al 2017 x mei et al 2019 the higher synergistic effects of various microorganisms in mbl mha resulted in higher efficient 2 4 dnp degradation the diversity of microorganisms at the phylum and genus levels in the three reactors is shown in fig 6 the illumina results indicated that the bacterial community was mainly composed of 37 phyla except for unclassified bacteria in mbl mha 35 phyla in mha and 32 phyla in anaerobic ha as shown in fig 6a the relative microbial community abundances were identified at the phylum level and bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi synergistetes actinobacteria and proteobacteria were dominant in these five samples with minor phyla accounting for a small fraction the main differences between the micro aeration ha and the anaerobic ha systems were attributed to the distribution of phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi synergistetes and actinobacteria relative abundances of the phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi synergistetes and actinobacteria were 16 15 18 4 16 81 12 46 and 14 84 in mbl mha and 14 74 20 45 14 12 14 17 and 12 46 in mha respectively which were significantly higher than those in anaerobic ha that is 8 80 13 56 11 69 9 17 and 7 62 respectively indicating that limited aeration could help selectively enrich specific species however relative abundances of the phyla proteobacteria and patescibacteria were 5 13 and 2 14 in mbl mha and 2 10 and 1 53 in mha respectively which was lower than that in anaerobic ha 11 67 and 17 80 respectively additionally relative abundances of these phyla in the mbl mha were also obviously higher than those in mha indicating that mbl mha was more favorable for selective enrichment of some specific species than mha additionally the relative bacterial community abundances of the suspended sludge mbl mha i and biofilm mbl mha ii in mbl mha were also identified at the phylum level fig 6a the relative abundances of bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria in the biofilm were 25 62 12 88 and 19 30 respectively and significantly higher than those in the suspended sludge 11 68 3 77 and 0 62 respectively nevertheless the relative abundances of chloroflexi synergistetes and actinobacteria in the suspended sludge 19 45 20 21 and 19 43 were obviously higher than those of the biofilm 7 67 4 66 and 8 84 respectively these results indicated that spatial distribution of the specific bacteria could be achieved using membrane based bubbleless micro aeration a similar spatial distribution structure has been reported wang et al 2009 kinh et al 2017 ma et al 2017 for example kinh et al 2017 found that nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria were gradually distributed from the membrane surface to the bulk liquid which realized simultaneous nitrification and denitrification these results could mainly be attributed to the following a single do gradient structure within the biofilm from the membrane biofilm interface to the bulk liquid caused by counter diffusion was clearly presented showing spatial variations of some specific species kinh et al 2017 ma et al 2017 the next objective was to gain insight into the microbial community structure in the three sludge samples thus the sequences from the dominant bacterial communities were analyzed at the genus level as follows fig 6b compared with the phylum level classifications the results of the genus level illustrated a greater diversity in the microbial communities in mbl mha mha and anaerobic ha samples which were composed of 334 318 and 262 genera respectively as shown in fig 6b differences were observed despite most of the genera being found in the five samples syner 01 5 64 georgenia 4 14 and sbr1031 6 24 were dominant in anaerobic ha syner 01 belonging to the phylum synergistetes includes hydrolytic bacteria with the ability to produce acetate through glucose fermentation si et al 2016 georgenia phylum actinobacteria is associated with the production of abundant hydrolytic enzymes that utilize organic matter such as glucose and is related to butyric acid production liu et al 2016 chen et al 2020a b c nelson et al 2011 sbr1031 phylum chloroflexi has been widely reported to utilize various substrates such as organic acids and have strong resistance to toxic organic pollutants chen et al 2020a b c nakasaki et al 2019 studies have demonstrated that actinobacteria and chloroflexi are important 2 4 dnp degrading bacteria in anaerobic conditions kimura et al 2003 arnett et al 2009 yang et al 2015 and under anaerobic conditions these bacteria can degrade 2 4 dnp into corresponding aminophenols including 2 4 dap 2 a 4 np and 2 n 4 ap kimura et al 2003 tang et al 2018 additionally under the micro aeration condition these facultative bacteria could by using molecular oxygen further accelerate the decomposition of these aminophenols resulting in the nh4 n release an et al 2020 in both micro aeration ha systems bacteroidetes vadinha17 7 55 of mbl mha 10 18 of mha mesotoga 4 55 of mbl mha 7 54 of mha and trichococcus 2 17 of mbl mha 10 28 of mha had higher relative abundances than those in anaerobic ha 2 07 1 46 and 1 78 moreover lentimicrobium 2 78 of mbl mha 0 78 of mha petrimonas 5 38 of mbl mha 1 44 of mha and fermentibacteraceae 3 61 of mbl mha 2 46 of mha were remarkably enriched in the two limited aeration ha systems nevertheless they showed the least relative abundance in anaerobic ha 0 15 0 47 and 0 62 respectively fermentibacteraceae and trichococcus within firmicutes can convert various organics to vfas by secreting various extracellular enzymes and subsequently to acetate h2 and co2 zhang et al 2018 owusu agyeman et al 2021 specifically the ability to tolerate high organic loading and toxic substances has also been reported jia et al 2019 yang et al 2016 ma et al 2020 lentimicrobium and bacteroidetes vadinha17 are highly related to the treatment of nitrate wastewater and denitrification processes niu et al 2021 h wang et al 2020 mielcarek et al 2016 notably petrimonas can metabolize amino acids to ethanol by transferring electrons to the limited molecular oxygen resulting from the promotion of interspecific electron transfer in the ha system wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 botheju et al 2009 reported that trace oxygen in an anaerobic bioreactor could act as a terminal electron acceptor to accelerate the hydrolysis of long chain organic compounds under facultative bacteria improving the electron transfer activity of microbial metabolism the relative abundance of this genus in mbl mha was significantly higher than that in mha indicating that the addition of micro aeration in ha could stimulate electron transfer activity of microbial metabolism especially membrane based bubbleless limited aeration moreover compared with that in mha and anaerobic ha the more differences were attributed to the distributions of the genera brevundimonas 7 53 and nitrosomonas 2 95 in mbl mha brevundimonas belonging to proteobacteria could enhance the decomposition of nitrogen containing organic matter such as aminophenols by using limited aeration resulting in the release of nh4 n he et al 2021 and nitrosomonas within proteobacteria oxidized nh4 n to no2 n by using free oxygen under a do below 0 5 mg l h wang et al 2020 in mbl mha relative abundances of brevundimonas 13 44 nitrosomonas 2 08 lentimicrobium 4 85 and petrimonas 9 46 from the biofilm were remarkably higher than those of the suspended sludge that is 0 01 0 01 0 21 and 0 30 respectively which might attribute to the fact that these genes were more attuned to micro aeration condition the syner 01 11 75 georgenia 14 32 and sbr1031 8 46 of the suspended sludge were richer than those of the biofilm 2 71 3 76 and 3 41 respectively according to the potential functions of these domain bacteria in the two micro aeration ha systems these dominant bacteria can be divided into four groups reduction associated bacteria oxidation associated bacteria interspecific electron transfer associated bacteria and fermentative bacteria in mha the oxidation associated bacteria such as syner 01 georgenia and sbr1031 could play a major role in denitration from nitrophenol reduction associated bacteria such as lentimicrobium and bacteroidetes vadinha17 could play a major role in denitrification the interspecific electron transfer associated bacteria were mainly represented by petrimonas which could improve the activity of microbial metabolism in ha fermentative bacteria such as fermentibacteraceae and trichococcus mainly convert the degradation intermediates of nitrophenol to vfas unlike the mha the reduction and oxidation associated bacteria in the mbl mha exhibited different functions in degrading 2 4 dnp specifically reduction associated bacteria could play a major role in ammoniation for reducing 2 4 dnp into corresponding aminophenols and denitrification such as syner 01 georgenia sbr1031 lentimicrobium and bacteroidetes vadinha17 these bacteria were mainly enriched in suspended sludge the oxidation associated bacteria could play a major role in the deamination of aminophenols and nitrosation such as brevundimonas and nitrosomonas these bacteria were mainly enriched in biofilms the fermentative bacteria could mainly convert the degradation intermediates of 2 4 dnp to vfas such as fermentibacteraceae and trichococcus the interspecific electron transfer associated bacteria were mainly represented by petrimonas which could improve the activity of microbial metabolism in the ha system these species were mainly enriched in the biofilm as indicated improved biodiversity enrichment of reduction related and oxidation related species within syntrophic interactions improvement in interspecific electron transfer related species and fermentative species might play a major role in enhancing 2 4 dnp degradation in micro aeration ha moreover these functional bacteria could be more enriched using membrane based bubbleless micro aeration because of a more obvious spatial distribution of the specific bacteria in the biofilm 3 5 label free quantitative proteomic profiling proteins are the products and functional units of the genome however the genome is not representative of protein levels because of the complex systems governing when and how much of a given protein should be present zhang et al 2019 hence further investigations on the metaproteome and its relationship with the metagenome in mbl mha mha and anaerobic ha were prompted by label free proteomic profiling four assays in phase ii i e mbl mha i mbl mha ii mha and anaerobic ha were analyzed a total of 456 768 secondary spectra were detected 22 801 peptides were matched and 22 801 peptide sequences and 7362 unique protein groups were identified in the four assays the number of proteins identified in each mbl mha i mha ii mha and anaerobic ha was 5157 5397 5232 and 5081 respectively quality assessment of the identified proteins revealed that the values data had good repeatability high quality and credibility in this study proteins were considered to be significantly differentially expressed table 3 compared with the proteins expressed in the anaerobic ha assay the number of upregulated proteins in samples mbl mha i mbl mha ii and mha amounted to 1508 1574 and 1504 respectively these results indicate that the addition of limited aeration in ha for the degradation of 2 4 dnp significantly affected the differential expression of functional proteins 3 5 1 gene ontology go functional annotation of upregulated proteins based on the go functional annotation of upregulated proteins as shown in fig 7 a the upregulated proteins of mbl mha i mbl mha ii and mha were associated with biological processes bp cell components cc and molecular functions mf compared with those in the assay anaerobic ha the upregulated proteins in the assays mbl mha i mbl mha ii and mha were classified into 24 functional groups 12 bp 2 cc 10 mf one protein may be involved in different bp and different proteins may be involved in the same process in the bp analysis against the assay anaerobic ha the majority of the upregulated proteins in the limited aeration assays were significantly assigned to the categories metabolic process interspecies interaction between organisms and cellular process p 0 05 and protein number 500 interspecies interactions can affect bacterial structure cell abundance and stress responses the enhanced interspecies interactions could display stronger stress tolerance rendering them substantially more robust for the treatment of toxic organic matter k w k lee et al 2014 the richfactor of interspecies interaction between organisms in the assay mbl mha ii was 0 99 and that in the assay mha and mbl mha i was 0 83 and 0 35 respectively indicating that compared with bubble micro aeration in ha the proteins with interspecies interactions could be more enhanced in membrane based bubbleless micro aeration in ha and this enhancement was primarily enriched in the biofilm according to the literature an obvious do gradient from the membrane biofilm to the bulk liquid and a rich microbial community structure in the biofilm could show an enhanced interspecies interaction x mei et al 2019 in addition the redox protein in eps could be the transient medium of interspecies interactions via its function of interspecific electron transfer xiao et al 2017 in this study the more abundant redox protein in tb eps in the biofilm on the membrane of mbl mha might promote this process more than mha these results implied one of the underlying reasons that using the membrane based bubbleless micro aeration into ha could enhance the degradation of 2 4 dnp even more than bubble micro aeration in the cc analysis most of the upregulated proteins in the micro aeration ha assays belonged to protein containing complex followed by cellular anatomical entity in the mf process most of the upregulated proteins in micro aeration ha were related to binding and catalytic activity functions the category catalytic activity included oxidoreductase activity acting on the choh aldehyde oxo nad p h chnh2 chch ch ch2 group of donors and hydrolase activity acting on acid anhydrides carbon nitrogen ester glycosyl acid halide and some transmembrane transporter activities zhang et al 2019 the richfactor of this activity function in the mbl mha ii assay was 0 94 which was higher than that of mha 0 62 and mbl mha i 0 55 these findings suggest that micro aeration ha could enhance the expression of proteins related to oxidoreductase activities ring cleavage and intermediate transmembrane processes for 2 4 dnp biodegradation better than anaerobic ha especially mbl mha 3 5 2 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg pathway annotation of upregulated proteins to further verify the metabolic and signaling pathways for the upregulated proteins in mbl mha and mha compared with those of anaerobic ha the identified proteins were annotated with kegg kegg pathway enrichment analysis further showed that limited aeration in ha enriched proteins was involved in various pathways such as nitrogen metabolism carbon metabolism glycolysis gluconeogenesis peroxisome oxidative phosphorylation and propanoate metabolism which are directly related to the efficiency of hydrolysis fermentation and 2 4 dnp degradation fig 7b a summary of significantly upregulated proteins p 0 05 and protein number 50 and their correlations with dominant bacterial species are shown in supporting information b the aforementioned results provide a general overview of the metabolic and signaling pathways of the upregulated proteins for 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha and mha compared with those in ha a detailed analysis based on the kegg pathway was subsequently conducted to improve the understanding of the process as shown in fig 7b compared with those of anaerobic ha protein active pathways for abc transporters oxidative phosphorylation quorum sensing qs biosynthesis of amino acids and nitrogen metabolism were significantly more abundant in sample mbl mha i and oxidative phosphorylation peroxisome nitrogen metabolism benzoate degradation and the citrate cycle i e tca cycle were more abundant in sample mbl mha ii p 0 05 and protein number 50 in addition protein active pathways for peroxisome nitrogen metabolism qs benzoate degradation and oxidative phosphorylation were more abundant in sample mha than in sample anaerobic ha p 0 05 and protein number 50 these abundant basic pathways in mbl mha and mha are primarily involved in for example organic matter metabolism bioenergy transmission and electron transfer for mbl mha nadh quinone oxidoreductase was the most significant oxidoreductase detected fold change 2 0 in the metaproteome of suspended sludge this oxidoreductase originated from the genera synergistales propionibacterium sp and deltaproteobacteria bacterium nadh quinone oxidoreductase activity has been well documented for nitro reduction processes under anaerobic conditions zhang et al 2019 in addition proteins for nitroreductase including nitroreductase family protein and nitrate reductase subunit beta which originated from the genera deltaproteobacteria and actinomycetales bacteria were also detected fold change 2 0 in the metagenome these proteins are involved in processes that can transfer nitro groups to amino groups huang et al 2012 accordingly in this study aminophenol intermediates with a structure similar to nitro reduction were identified in the analysis of metabolites by lc ms in mbl mha additionally abundant proteins for nadh quinone oxidoreductase and adenosine triphosphate atp synthase were detected fold change 2 50 in the biofilm metaproteome which originated from the gene brevundimonas diminuta according to the literature under the micro aeration condition as air or oxygen has negative charges air or oxygen could attract nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad transfer increasing the production of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh zhang et al 2021 thus to maintain redox balance nadh nad nadh can be regenerated through nadh quinone oxidoreductase which produces small amounts of atp kyzas et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 additionally nitrite reductase was detected fold change 2 50 in biofilms that originated from the genera propionibacterium sp and syntrophus sp ptab bin138 implying that nitrosation of ammonia nitrogen from suspended sludge occurred in the biofilm to generate nitrite and the generated nitrite underwent denitrification under micro aeration conditions x mei et al 2019 2020 the genes annotated to pyruvate ferredoxin flavodoxin oxidoreductase were mainly derived fold change 5 50 from cells of the genera propionibacterium sp genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase fold change 7 50 and acetate kinase fold change 142 97 from the genera propionibacterium sp and brevundimonas diminuta were significantly detected in the metagenome of the biofilm therefore 2 4 dnp was supposed to be degraded to aminophenol in suspended sludge and then further to pyruvate succinate and acetate and then to the tca metabolic process in the biofilm in mbl mha x mei et al 2019 khan et al 2019 ammonia nitrogen as a derivative of aminophenol degradation under micro aeration conditions could be oxidized to nitrite and then the generated nitrite underwent denitrification in the biofilm x mei et al 2019 2020 for the mha proteins for nadh quinone oxidoreductase in the detected metaproteome fold change 2 40 originated from the gene brevundimonas diminuta which was consistent with that in the biofilm of mbl mha indicating that these nadh quinone oxidoreductases might be primarily used to regenerate nadh rather than reduce nitro groups nitrite reductase was also detected fold change 2 00 which originated from the genera propionibacterium sp and actinomycetales bacterium however nitroreductase was not detected sufficiently in the metaproteome implying that the nitro groups of 2 4 dnp were directly removed in mha similar results have been reported by moreno et al 2012 and khan et al 2019 khan et al 2019 revealed that under micro aeration of 0 3 mg l into an anaerobic system 2 4 dnp was primarily degraded via the benzenethiol pathway to nitrite and benzenethiol the genes annotated to pyruvate ferredoxin flavodoxin oxidoreductase were mainly derived fold change 2 20 from cells of the genera propionibacterium sp genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase from the genera actinomycetales fold change 3 79 and propionibacterium sp fold change 10 28 were significantly detected in the metagenome therefore 2 4 dnp was supposed to be degraded via the benzenethiol pathway to nitrite and benzenethiol and then benzenethiol was degraded to pyruvate and succinate in mha additionally the protein active pathway for qs was improved under both micro aeration ha systems and these proteins were mainly involved in abc transporters supporting information b studies have reported that qs is related to the secretion of tb eps chen et al 2019 in this study more abundant tb eps was secreted in both micro aeration ha than that in ha these results might be the reason for the improved protein active pathway for qs under micro aeration conditions in further research the active pathway of qs proteins under micro aeration conditions should be further investigated 3 6 2 4 dnp degradation mechanisms in mbl mha and mha according to the aforementioned analysis results mbl mha exhibited higher 2 4 dnp degradation efficiency higher fermentation ability and more abundant biodiversity and richness than mha considering the analyses of degradation products eps microbial community and metaproteome the synergistic mechanisms responsible for the degradation of 2 4 dnp in mbl mha and mha are proposed in fig 8 the underlying reasons could be mainly attributed to the following aspects on one hand membrane based bubbleless micro aeration could exhibit higher oxygen transfer ability than bubble micro aeration which could augment the oxygen utilization capacity and metabolic rates of microorganisms zhang et al 2021 on the other hand the redox microenvironments caused by counter diffusion using membrane based bubbleless micro aeration were more beneficial for the degradation of 2 4 dnp than co diffusion using bubble micro aeration for mbl mha the microenvironments caused by counter diffusion were such that the surface layer of the biofilm and bulk liquid were anaerobic and the remaining biofilm was micro aerated 2 4 dnp could be degraded first by anaerobic degradation and then by microaerobic degradation briefly the corresponding aminophenols such as 2 a 4 np 2 n 4 ap and 2 4 dap are first formed through nitroreduction and then phenol is formed through deamination under anaerobic conditions jiang et al 2016 tang et al 2018 the reducing force could be formed by the expression of functional proteins such as oxidoreductase nadp dependent oxidoreductase and nitroreductase and transferred to redox proteins in eps which then drive nitroreduction and deamination to reduce 2 4 dnp additionally nitrosation of ammonia nitrogen from suspended sludge and the denitrification process could co occur in the biofilm under nitrite reductase subsequently phenol suffered from aromatic ring cleavage to succinate and then to acetate under micro aeration in the biofilm the oxidation force could be formed by the expression of functional proteins for example succinate dehydrogenase acetate kinase nadh quinone oxidoreductase and pyruvate oxidoreductase and transferred to redox proteins in tb eps which then drive the cleavage of the aromatic ring to produce acetate or some small molecules thus as more reducing and oxidizing forces became available to these reduction oxidation related interspecific electron transfer related and fermentative species in mbl mha the more effective 2 4 dnp degradation performance was obtained for mha the microenvironments caused by co diffusion were such that the surface layer of the suspended sludge and bulk liquid was microaerobic and the inside of the sludge was anaerobic 2 4 dnp could be degraded first by microaerobic degradation and then by anaerobic degradation briefly 2 4 dnp first suffered from bond cleavage between the nitro group and the aromatic ring through hydroxylation to produce nitrite and benzenethiol subsequently a small amount of benzenethiol suffered from cleavage of the aromatic ring to pyruvate and succinate in addition nitrite can be removed through denitrification processes the oxidizing and reducing forces could be formed by the expression of functional proteins for example succinate dehydrogenase acetate kinase nadh quinone oxidoreductase pyruvate oxidoreductase and transferred to redox proteins in eps which then drive the hydroxylation and nitro group removal from the benzene ring and denitrification generally denitration is the rate limiting step of 2 4 dnp degradation under certain amounts of oxygen because of its strong electron withdrawing property x mei et al 2019 and anaerobic reduction is conducive to its transformation to amino groups tang et al 2018 x mei et al 2019 additionally on the one hand the toxicity of the corresponding metabolites aminophenol was significantly lower than that of 2 4 dnp tang et al 2018 x mei et al 2019 and on the other hand aminophenol is more easily degraded under micro aeration than under anaerobic conditions x mei et al 2019 moreover the addition of trace oxygen in an anaerobic bioreactor as a terminal electron acceptor could accelerate the hydrolysis of long chain organic compounds under facultative bacteria improving the electron transfer activity of microbial metabolism botheju et al 2009 4 conclusion this comprehensive study examined 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha and compared it with that in mha and anaerobic ha the results showed that 2 4 dnp degradation could be stably enhanced in mbl mha and mha during the experiment especially in mbl mha 2 4 dnp degradation rates were 84 43 97 28 in mbl mha which was higher than the 82 41 94 71 in mha under the micro aeration of 0 5 5 0 ml air min these results were mainly due to the redox microenvironments caused by counter diffusion using membrane based bubbleless micro aeration were more suitable for 2 4 dnp degradation than co diffusion using bubble micro aeration the 2 4 dnp degradation pathways were nitroreduction deamination aromatic ring cleavage and fermentation in mbl mha and hydroxylation aromatic ring cleavage and fermentation in mha abundant reduction oxidation related interspecific electron transfer related and fermentative species were enriched in mbl mha the label free quantitative proteomic approach suggested that more reducing oxidizing forces formed by more redox proteins enzymes from these rich species could enhance 2 4 dnp degradation in mbl mha the observed efficient stable reactor performance demonstrated that this mbl mha offers substantial promise for the efficient treatment of wastewater containing nitrophenol pollutants in further research aspects of the fate of mbl mha that should be further explored are influent factors treatment of actual wastewater containing nitrophenol and development of new economical microaerobic membrane materials credit authorship contribution statement zhuowei zhang methodology formal analysis writing

16276,microplastic mp pollution in oceans is an emerging environmental problem that poses ecological risks for marine ecosystems based on the abundance distribution and characteristics of microplastics mps in surface water sediment and organisms mp sources pollution trophic transfer and ecological risk in xiangshan bay an area of intensive mariculture in east china sea were assessed in this study mps were prevalent in the environment and organisms with overall abundances at a low medium level compared with the levels in the coastal areas in water mps were more abundant in the inner bay 0 32 items m 3 which is a more significant source of mps with intensive mariculture than the central 0 09 items m 3 and outer bays 0 07 items m 3 the narrow and land enclosed inner bay with weak hydrodynamics for water exchange retained mps thus increasing their abundance the ecological risk of mps in water was at a low moderate level the mp abundance in sediment did not vary significantly among the three regions of the bay the morphological characteristics and polymers of the mps differed in sediment from those in water which was related to their diverse environmental redistribution routes mp abundance ingested by organisms were related to their biological features and foraging habits overall fish ingested more mps than crustaceans bivalves and cephalopods while zooplankton ingested the minimal mps filter feeders ingested less mps with a preference for smaller particles than predators mps did not show trophic transfer behavior in organisms additionally mps ingested by infauna showed similar morphological and chemical characteristics compared to sediment at the point of organism residence whereas mps ingested by pelagic species were dissimilar to those in surface water our findings provide information for understanding mp pollution source tracing trophic transfer and ecological risk assessment in coastal ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics abundance characteristics ecological risk trophic transfer 1 introduction as an emerging pollutant microplastics mps 5 mm are widely distributed in the oceans from near shore waters and marginal seas to deep oceans and even polar regions browne et al 2011 auta et al 2017 xu et al 2021 a proportion of these plastic particles are transported vertically and are eventually deposited into the sediment dai et al 2018 liu et al 2020 meanwhile mps can be ingested by organisms either through direct ingestion from the surrounding environment or from prey farrell and nelson 2013 therefore mps not only occur in environmental media but also in a wide range of organisms at various trophic levels tls table appendix a once ingested mps can cause mechanical damage to the organisms such as scratching blockage of the digestive tract and reduced feeding efficiency auta et al 2017 a recent study summarized the findings of microplastic mp studies in the global oceans and found that mps vary significantly in their spatiotemporal distribution with different morphological and chemical characteristics xu et al 2021 abundances of mps range from 0 002 to 9180 items m 3 in water regardless of the sampling methods net trawling or bulk water and from 0 97 to 7960 items kg 1 in sediment xu et al 2021 additionally mps are most abundant in coastal waters because these areas commonly receive a large number of plastic particles from river influx and intensive fishery and mariculture activities su et al 2020 schell et al 2021 xu et al 2021 however partially owing to a lack of criteria or standardized methods some basic topics in the study of mp pollution in environmental media and organisms are not adequately investigated some example of such topics are mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal distributions of mps regulation of biological features of organisms for ingesting mps and trophic transfer behavior and ecological and health risk assessments of mps xiangshan bay is a long and narrow bay approximately 60 km long 3 8 km wide 563 km2 and 20 m deep in most of the water that is partially enclosed by land in the east china sea the hydrodynamics of the bay are characterized by a semidiurnal tide averaging 3 2 m tidal range relatively low tidal prism 1 2 billion m3 and long residence time of water e g 80 and 60 days for 90 water exchanges in the inner and central bay respectively chen 1992 these geographical and hydrological features reduce the ability of the bay to exchange water with the open sea xiangshan bay is a traditional spawning and nursery ground for many fishery species where various fishing activities e g trawler gill net set net and trap net polypropylene pp as dominant material are operated furthermore approximately a total of 16 km2 of the surface water mostly located in the inner bay has been allocated to the mariculture of fishery species e g kelp shellfish shrimps crabs and fish in rafts and cages pp polyethylene pe and polystyrene ps are the main constituent materials wu et al 2020 in addition a total of 37 rivers along the coast discharge an estimated annual amount of 1 3 billion m3 influx into the bay bring plastic waste from the industries related to plastic products into the water chen 1992 wu et al 2020 consequently large amounts of land and ocean originated mps may continuously enter into the bay via river influx discarded and broken fishing gears and mariculture facilities e g nets floats rafts and cages chen et al 2018 mps have also been found in the common organisms of the bay wu et al 2020 the diverse sources of plastic waste and weak ability to exchange water with the open sea are favorable for retaining mps in the environment and the ingestion of the particles by organisms making xiangshan bay an ideal area for the study of mp pollution to better understand the mp pollution in coastal ecosystems three hypotheses were proposed and tested in this study 1 mps in water and sediment do not necessarily show high similarity in characteristics due to the influences of multiple factors on their spatial distribution and transfer behavior 2 mps ingested by organisms are not necessarily correlated to particles in the environment by abundance or characteristics due to the highly varied ecological features and foraging behavior of organisms 3 mps do not exhibit trophic transfer or bioaccumulation in organisms because they cannot be digested or assimilated by organisms to test these hypotheses we investigated the abundance spatial distribution and characteristics size shape and chemical components of the mps in surface water sediment and organisms of xiangshan bay subsequently the trophic transfer of mps in the organisms and their ecological risk in the water were assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection surface water samples were collected from 16 stations across xiangshan bay in may 2019 covering three regions with differing oceanography and maritime functions inner bay central bay and outer bay fig 1 a supplementary data table s1 a plankton net mesh 330 μm mouth diameter of 45 cm and length of 1 8 m with a flowmeter hydro bios germany was used to collect the samples at each station the net was towed horizontally in the surface water 0 3 m for 30 min at a speed of approximately 2 0 knots after towing mps were collected with a collector fixed at the bottom of the net the samples were preserved in glass bottles and stored at 4 c until mp extraction sediment samples were collected simultaneously with the water samples using a grab sampler van veen hydro bios germany at 13 stations fig 1a supplementary data table s1 approximately 200 g of sediment in triplicate was collected from each station wrapped in aluminum and stored at 20 c until mp extraction biological samples were collected at different stations using varying sampling methods that depended on the species fig 1a supplementary data table s1 zooplankton were sampled using a plankton net mesh of 505 μm mouth diameter of 50 cm and length of 1 8 m which was towed horizontally in the surface water for 30 min at approximately 2 knots at each of the 16 stations 4 5 21 8 m in depth crustacean cephalopod and fish samples were collected using a demersal trawler at six stations stations 6 8 12 14 at depth of 7 5 21 8 m bivalves were collected at three stations by dredging stations 2 4 and 6 at depth of 8 6 14 2 m supplementary data table s1 a total of 20 species were collected for mp detection and to determine the stable n isotope compositions to calculate the tls the zooplankton samples were stored in vials and other biological samples were stored in aluminum bags at 20 c until mp extraction 2 2 sample pretreatment and microplastic extraction 2 2 1 water samples we referred to wang et al 2020 for the methods used to extract mps from water samples samples were filtered through 5 and 0 3 mm mesh size stacked stainless steel sieves using deionized water to separate the macroplastics and mesoplastics from the mps solid particles collected in the 0 3 mm sieve were transferred to a 500 ml glass beaker and digested with 200 ml aliquots of koh 10 v v and h2o2 30 v v solutions the digested solution was then filtered through 0 7 μm glass filters gf f whatman uk after filtration the filters were transferred to glass dishes covered with foil and dried at 25 c for further analysis 2 2 2 sediment samples the mps from the sediment samples were extracted following the method suggested by wu et al 2020 samples were dried to a constant weight at 60 c for 72 h a density separation method was applied to extract the mps during each analysis 50 g dry weight d w of sediment in triplicate was mixed with 400 ml of nacl solution 1 2 g ml 1 in a glass beaker and manually stirred with a clean glass rod for 2 min after sedimentation for 24 h the nacl solution containing the mps was transferred into another glass beaker subsequently 10 ml of h2o2 30 v v was added to 400 ml solutions for 24 h to degrade the organic matter the digested solution was then filtered through 0 7 μm glass filters gf f whatman uk after filtration the filters were transferred to glass dishes covered with foil and dried at 25 c for subsequent analysis 2 2 3 biological samples the methods by wu et al 2020 goswami et al 2020 and gong et al 2021 were followed for the extraction of mps from the organisms the biological samples were thawed and rinsed with deionized water for basic biological measurements such as the body size for crustaceans cephalopods and fish or the shell size for bivalves the tissues of each individual were freshly dissected and collected for mp extraction the tissues included the entire body for zooplanktons soft tissues for bivalves and crustaceans digestive tracts and muscles for cephalopods and gills digestive tracts and muscles for fish a total of 50 individuals for the copepod calanus sinicus 10 individuals pooled as

0 05 fig 6b the tmf of the mps in the organisms was 0 1 therefore mps did not show trophic transfer or bioaccumulation in organisms 3 2 3 comparison of microplastic characteristics in different media according to the shape or chemical components mps 0 7 μm ingested by infauna showed relatively high similarity 0 83 or 0 81 in renkonen similarity index respectively to those in the sediment where the infauna occurs fig 7 by contrast mps 0 33 mm ingested by pelagic species showed low similarity 0 16 or 0 14 to those in the surface water where the organisms occur similarities between the shapes or chemical components of the mps 0 33 mm in the surface water and sediment were low 0 33 or 0 17 fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 spatial distribution and characteristics of microplastics in the environment applications in source tracing there are significant spatial variations in the abundance of mps in the ocean ranging globally from 0 002 to 1602 for net sampling and 8 to 9180 items m 3 for bulk sampling xu et al 2021 compared with mps in other waters along the chinese coast 0 045 514 items m 3 determined via net trawling with similar mesh sizes 330 or 333 μm xu et al 2021 the mp abundance in the surface water 0 17 items m 3 of xiangshan bay was at a relatively low level in this study mps were more abundant in the inner bay than in the other parts of the bay there are a few explanations for this first industries are concentrated along the coast of the inner bay with an annual production of 5 5 million tons of plastic resins and one million tons of other plastic products wu et al 2020 plastic wastes originating on land are discharged into the water via the river influx which increases the abundance of plastic particles in the inner bay second fishing and mariculture activities can produce a large number of mps increasing the mp abundance in regions of intensive mariculture chen et al 2018 over 90 of the 16 km2 of mariculture algae mollusks shrimp and fish with an annual production of 0 28 million tons in recent years is concentrated in the inner bay a large number of plastic facilities e g nets floaters cages and rafts occupy these waters wu et al 2020 discarded or unusable plastic wastes from these facilities increase the mps source intensity this is supported by the fact that ps polymer and foam the two common materials used in floats for fishing and mariculture facilities were the most prevalent plastic polymers in the inner bay and were significantly more prevalent than in the other parts of the bay third ocean hydrodynamics play an important role in determining the spatial distribution and redistribution of mps in water the inner bay is almost entirely enclosed by land with low hydrodynamics it takes approximately 80 days for 80 of the water in the inner bay to be exchanged significantly longer than the 15 days required for the outer bay ning and hu 2002 consequently there is a disruption of mps diffusion or transportation from the inner bay to other waters facilitating the retention or accumulation of mps a similar spatial distribution of mps has been observed in other areas such as the bohai sea here mps were most abundant in liaodong bay which is farthest from the bohai strait and is characterized by the lowest self purification or water exchange capacity xu et al 2021 finally resuspension of mps from sediment via river influx or wind and storms can increase the mp abundance in the shallow inner bay 10 m in most of the water microplastics in the marine environment have diverse morphological and chemical characteristics the shapes and chemical components of these mps are important indicators for source tracing auta et al 2017 for example foam and lines are considered to commonly originate from broken fishery facilities such as floats and nets in xiangshan bay these two plastic shapes accounted for 64 4 of the mps this suggests that plastic debris from fishery facilities were likely to be a major contributor to the mps in the bay films typically originate from plastic materials used in agriculture such as film mulching or plastic houses for agricultural cultivation zhu et al 2018 in xiangshan bay films only accounted for 5 0 of the mps indicating that plastic from agriculture made less of a contribution to the mps in the bay dozens of polymers have been recorded in the global oceans with ps pe and pp being the most frequently detected hidalgo ruz et al 2012 while ps polymers are prevalent in mariculture areas hinojosa and thiel 2009 in xiangshan bay ps polymers accounted for 66 9 of the mps which were most abundant in the inner bay furthermore pe and pp two polymers also often used for the manufacture of fishing and mariculture facilities such as cages and nets accounted for 31 0 of the mps in the bay these findings further support the assumption that ocean originated plastic makes a large contribution to the mps in surface water of xiangshan bay in the sediment of the oceans there is significant spatial variation in the abundance of mps ranging globally from 0 97 to 7960 items kg 1 xu et al 2021 in xiangshan bay mps were detected in all of the sediment samples with an average abundance of 139 0 items kg 1 which is at a low medium level compared with other bays along the chinese coast 15 4205 items kg 1 xu et al 2021 contrary to that in water the abundance of mps in the sediment did not vary spatially across the bay particles 330 µm baseline size for the water samples in this study only accounted for a small proportion 8 6 of the mps in the sediment baseline size of 0 7 µm a comparison of mps 330 µm could provide information on analyzing the dissimilarity in their characteristics between the two environmental media specifically in water foam dominated the particles while fiber was minimally detected by contrast in the sediment fibers dominated the particles while foam was the least common fibers were likely to be missed by plankton net sampling because they can orient longitudinally and escape from nets resulting in their loss from the water samples based on the detected polymers pe and pp were common polymers in both media and ps was dominant while ry was rarely detected in water by contrast in the sediment ry accounted for the largest proportion of the particles while ps rarely occurred ry is a fabric made from cellulose fibers that are usually strengthened with synthetic additives as one of the most commercialized artificial fibers ry is frequently used for making textiles and personal hygiene products remy et al 2015 domestic sewage is an important source of ry in the marine environment lusher et al 2013 wang et al 2020 although ry particles are more easily degraded than those of the traditional polymers they are less degradable than the purified cellulose fibers this property favored the retention and accumulation of ry in the sediment of the bay for a relatively long period of time in contrast to the finding that mariculture derived plastics likely had a large contribution to the mps in xiangshan bay only a small proportion of the mps in the sediment were likely related to mariculture facilities i e foam or fragment for shape ps pe and pp for polymer microplastic deposition in sediment is primarily caused by the sinking of the particles presents in the water columns with a small proportion of particles originating from other sources such as waste dumping the fate of mps in the two media is also quite different mps in sediment rarely experience drastic changes in their abundance or distribution unless they are resuspended by natural forces particularly in low hydraulic dynamic environments such as xiangshan bay however mps in the water can be redistributed via diverse routes for example they can attach to other materials or be ingested by a wide range of organisms hence they can be transported anywhere in the oceans doyle et al 2011 markic et al 2018 a large proportion of mps are continually retained and move in water columns driven by environmental forces such as wind and ocean hydraulics sediment deposition tends to occur for high density polymer particles e g ry and pet and other polymers that lose buoyancy for various causes e g biofouling or aggregation foam commonly has a relatively low density and thus possesses a high buoyancy in water compared with other shapes such as fibers and lines this allows for the suspension of particles such as foam in water columns for relatively long periods considering these characteristics and the redistribution of plastic particles ry fibers high density in shape and polymer were dominant among the mps in the sediment although ps foams low density dominated particles in the water in other words mps in the two environmental media are not necessarily correlated or distributed proportionally 4 2 microplastic ingestion by organisms with references to their biological and ecological features in this study mps were detected in all species indicating that they were ingested by a wide range of organisms their abundances in the organisms also varied greatly 0 04 2 3 items ind 1 compared with previously reported results the mps in the organisms of xiangshan bay were at a relatively low level overall table appendix a the mp abundances in the environment had a significant effect on the mp ingestion by marine organisms even within the same species table appendix a other factors particularly the biological and ecological features of organisms also influence their propensity to ingest mps of the five biological groups investigated zooplankton minimally ingested mps in this study a relatively large dominant species copepod calanus sinicus 2 1 3 3 mm was investigated as a representative of zooplankton to compare their ingestion for mps with other biological groups although the low density foams were the most prevalent in the surface water where zooplankton occur they mostly ingested fibers i e the least abundant particles zooplankton commonly filter and ingest mps from the water the relative size ratio of the predator to prey plays a critical role in mp ingestion in the surface water foam commonly occurred as large particles and thus may have not been suitable for ingestion by zooplankton understanding the potential mismatch between the mp size and zooplankton feeding organs could provide information on interpreting this paradoxical result of the other biological groups fish ingested more mps than crustaceans and cephalopods fish commonly move and forage across a wider range of water columns than other biological groups they can filter a larger volume of water in different layers and thus more frequently encounter and ingest mps with a wider size range 0 14 4 8 mm by contrast crustaceans and cephalopods have fewer opportunities to ingest mps 0 18 3 6 mm because they generally swim slowly and reside in a limited layer of bottom water where plastic particles are usually less abundant than in the other water layers dai et al 2018 the feeding behaviors or habits of organisms can also regulate their ingestion of mps compared with predators filter feeders e g zooplanktons crustaceans and bivalves generally ingest relatively few and small mps by filtering particles from the environment predators such as some species of fish ingest mps with a wider size range 0 14 4 8 mm in more ways than filtering feeders 0 15 3 9 mm additionally predators can actively capture plastic particles that appear similar to food pellets ory et al 2017 all of these feeding strategies allow predators to efficiently ingest plastic particles finally predatory fish usually have complex digestive tract structures which favor the attachment and retention of plastic particles jabeen et al 2017 the mps ingested by organism are not necessarily always consistent with the plastic particles in the environment they reside in this study the mps in the infauna e g bivalves and mantis shrimp and sediment which were pretreated and determined using the same filter membrane 0 7 µm showed a relatively high similarity of characteristics by shape and polymer by contrast the similarity of the mps at the same baseline size 330 µm in the surface water and pelagic species residing there showed a low similarity either by shape or polymer first a mismatch between the spatial distribution of the mps in the water and the living habitats of organisms can partially account for the dissimilarity migratory species frequently move across the bay and open oceans while mps can retain in a relatively limited water space and remain in their digestive tracts for extended periods therefore the mps detected in the organisms do not necessarily reflect the particles in the waters in which they were captured second mp morphology can influence their ingestion by organisms for example foams that were primarily originated from mariculture facilities were usually large and conspicuous in color which could help organisms discriminate them from prey this could reduce the likelihood that organisms ingest such mp particles at random as is revealed in goldfish and palm ruff ory et al 2018 xiong et al 2019 finally particles such as foam and fragments are more easily egested than fibers qiao et al 2019 therefore mariculture derived foam the most prevalent particle in the surface water was negligibly detected in the organisms of xiangshan bay considering that the ingestion of mps by organisms can be influenced by multiple factors other than the mp concentrations in the water the mps in the pelagic species and surface waters unsurprisingly showed a low similarity with respect to their individual characteristics nonetheless given that the mps abundance varies in the water layers investigation of the vertical distribution of mps is necessary for accurately evaluating the similarity of mps in the waters and those ingested by organisms residing there in future studies 4 3 perspectives on trophic transfer and ecological risk of microplastics as mps can be transferred from the aquatic environment to organisms or from prey to predator the trophic transfer hypothesis for mps in aquatic food webs has attracted increasing interest from researchers diepens and koelmans 2018 gouin 2020 covernton et al 2021 currently mp trophic transfer in aquatic food webs has rarely been observed in field studies for example the mp abundance in the digestive tracts of fish did not show trophic transfer in a freshwater ecosystem garcia et al 2021 an analysis of published data did not reveal evidence for the bioaccumulation of mps from low to high tls in marine food webs miller et al 2020 nonetheless a review of recent studies indicated that marine organisms at lower tls appear to be at a greater risk of ingesting mps than those at higher tls walkinshaw et al 2020 mp trophic transfer in the organisms of xiangshan bay was not detected in this study examining the physical properties of the mps could provide information for explaining this phenomenon first the bioaccumulation of contaminants such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants pops involve a series of metabolic processes in organisms major processes include the assimilation and detoxification of contaminants in digestive organs transportation in circulation organs elimination in urinary organs and accumulation in biological tissues contaminants in the form of ions or molecules e g hg and cr can be transferred bioaccumulated or biomagnified from prey to predator liu et al 2019 however mps commonly occur in solid forms in the aquatic environment and are thus not easily digested or assimilated by organisms second mps larger than specific sizes cannot penetrate cell membranes for transport into the organs via the blood or lymph circulation systems accordingly the transfer of plastic particles from digestive tracts to other tissues or organs appears unlikely because neither the cellular nor intercellular transfer of such particles is physiologically possible batel et al 2020 for example ps particles 250 nm could only be adsorbed onto the intestinal tract and outer epidermis of zebrafish embryos van pomeren et al 2017 in goldfish larvae ps microspheres 5 μm were not enriched in the tissues yang et al 2020 translocation of pet fibers 62 μm did not occur in the tissues or organs of a daphnia jemec et al 2016 similarly no mps were detected in the muscles of fish and cephalopods in this study these findings imply that the majority of mps detectable in the aquatic environment using current techniques cannot participate in the blood and lymph circulations of organisms therefore bioaccumulation in the tissues and organs cannot occur third most of the mps in organisms were detected in their digestive tracts their abundance typically reflected the relationships among the ingestion retention and egestion of mps in the digestive tracts not the relationship with the tls of the organisms for example 10 d after offering prey containing pvc mps to a crab and a puffer no plastic particles were detected in their biological tissues but they were detected in the feces santana et al 2017 similarly mp particles fed to goldfish were thoroughly egested 72 h after ingestion with negligible retention in the organs of the fish grigorakis et al 2017 xiong et al 2019 considering these physical properties and the physiological processes involved in their transportation in organisms the trophic transfer hypothesis for mps in organisms should be addressed with caution in other words the mp trophic transfer cannot be appropriately assessed simply by testing the correlation between their abundance in organisms and the tl as is frequently practiced in field studies in current studies the mps detected in organisms only reflect detectable particles that may just temporarily remain in digestive tracts but will eventually be egested by contrast tiny particles which have the potential for bioaccumulation or biomagnification are barely detectable or countable to address this issue improving the techniques to detect and include particles of all sizes in all tissues or organs that can bioaccumulate contaminants e g livers kidneys and muscles is important nonetheless mps can function as carriers allowing other contaminants from the environment to enter organisms or transfer from prey to predator fossi et al 2014 diepens and koelmans 2018 for example higher concentrations of bisphenol were detected in fish with mps in their guts as compared with individuals with no plastic particles barboza et al 2020 therefore ingesting mps from prey likely creates a route for the transfer or bioaccumulation of other contaminants in food webs currently owing to a lack of standards or criteria for quantifying polymer toxicity the ecological risk of mps in the environment and organisms has not been adequately investigated plastic polymers are composed of a variety of monomers and polymerization reactions often do not attain completion during plastic production therefore unreacted residual monomers and additives occur in plastic materials several of which are hazardous and pose threats to the environment in this study three indices were employed to assess the ecological risks of mps in water referring to the hazard scores for polymers used in previous studies pan et al 2021 the overall ecological risk in the bay was at a low moderate level comparable to the levels in other chinese coastal waters such as the changjiang river estuary dongshan bay and the mangrove waters of southern china xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 pan et al 2021 given that mps composed of hazardous polymers are most abundant in the inner bay the ecological risk in this area was naturally higher than in the central and outer bays additionally mps are often attached to or covered with other contaminants owing to their rough surface structures and absorbency therefore the toxicity of the contaminants attached to mps should also be considered when assessing ecological or health risks in future studies 5 conclusions microplastics occur in the water sediment and organisms of xiangshan bay in the water mps were most abundant in the inner bay in the region concentrated with intensive mariculture operations mariculture originated plastics were a major contributor to the mps in this region the low hydrodynamics in the inner bay favors mp retention in the sediment the spatial distribution of mps did not significantly differ across the bay overall the characteristics of the mps in the two environmental media were heterogeneous in terms of shape and chemical components microplastic abundance ingested by organisms were related to their biological features and foraging habits overall fish ingested more mps than crustaceans bivalves and cephalopods while zooplankton ingested minimal mps filter feeders ingesting fewer mps and showing a preference for smaller particles than predatory species mps did not show trophic transfer behavior in the organisms overall the abundances of mps in the environment of xiangshan bay were at a low medium level compared with those in other coastal areas the ecological risks from mps in the water of the bay were at a low moderate level these were much higher in the inner bay than in the other parts of the bay briefly mps in the marine environmental media or organisms do not necessarily show high similarity in abundance or morphological and chemical characteristics mps in all tissues of organisms should be included when trophic transfer of mps is proposed or addressed the toxicity of other contaminants attached to mps should be considered at ecological risk assessment for mps declaration of competing interest none

keywords microplastics abundance characteristics ecological risk trophic transfer 1 introduction as an emerging pollutant microplastics mps 5 mm are widely distributed in the oceans from near shore

water regardless of the sampling methods net trawling or bulk water and from 0 97 to 7960 items kg 1 in sediment xu et al 2021 additionally mps are most abundant in coastal waters because these areas commonly receive a large number of plastic particles from river influx and intensive fishery and mariculture activities su et al 2020 schell et al 2021 xu et al 2021 however partially owing to a lack of criteria or standardized methods some basic topics in the study of mp pollution in environmental media and organisms are not adequately investigated some example of such topics are mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal distributions of mps regulation of biological features of organisms for ingesting mps and trophic transfer behavior and ecological and health risk assessments of mps xiangshan bay is a long and narrow bay approximately 60 km long 3 8 km wide 563 km2 and 20 m deep in most of the water that is partially enclosed by land in the east china sea the hydrodynamics of the bay are characterized by a semidiurnal tide averaging 3 2 m tidal range relatively low tidal prism 1 2 billion m3 and long residence time of water e g 80 and 60 days for 90 water exchanges in the inner and central bay respectively chen 1992 these geographical and hydrological features reduce the ability of the bay to exchange water with the open sea xiangshan bay is a traditional spawning and nursery ground for many fishery species where various fishing activities e g trawler gill net set net and trap net polypropylene pp as dominant material are operated furthermore approximately a total of 16 km2 of the surface water mostly located in the inner bay has been allocated to the mariculture of fishery species e g kelp shellfish shrimps crabs and fish in rafts and cages pp polyethylene pe and polystyrene ps are the main constituent materials wu et al 2020 in addition a total of 37 rivers along the coast discharge an estimated annual amount of 1 3 billion m3 influx into the bay bring plastic waste from the industries related to plastic products into the water chen 1992 wu et al 2020 consequently large amounts of land and ocean originated mps may continuously enter into the bay via river influx discarded and broken fishing gears and mariculture facilities e g nets floats rafts and cages chen et al 2018 mps have also been found in the common organisms of the bay wu et al 2020 the diverse sources of plastic waste and weak ability to exchange water with the open sea are favorable for retaining mps in the environment and the ingestion of the particles by organisms making xiangshan bay an ideal area for the study of mp pollution to better understand the mp pollution in coastal ecosystems three hypotheses were proposed and tested in this study 1 mps in water and sediment do not necessarily show high similarity in characteristics due to the influences of multiple factors on their spatial distribution and transfer behavior 2 mps ingested by organisms are not necessarily correlated to particles in the environment by abundance or characteristics due to the highly varied ecological features and foraging behavior of organisms 3 mps do not exhibit trophic transfer or bioaccumulation in organisms because they cannot be digested or assimilated by organisms to test these hypotheses we investigated the abundance spatial distribution and characteristics size shape and chemical components of the mps in surface water sediment and organisms of xiangshan bay subsequently the trophic transfer of mps in the organisms and their ecological risk in the water were assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection surface water samples were collected from 16 stations across xiangshan bay in may 2019 covering three regions with differing oceanography and maritime functions inner bay central bay and outer bay fig 1 a supplementary data table s1 a plankton net mesh 330 μm mouth diameter of 45 cm and length of 1 8 m with a flowmeter hydro bios germany was used to collect the samples at each station the net was towed horizontally in the surface water 0 3 m for 30 min at a speed of approximately 2 0 knots after towing mps were collected with a collector fixed at the bottom of the net the samples were preserved in glass bottles and stored at 4 c until mp extraction sediment samples were collected simultaneously with the water samples using a grab sampler van veen hydro bios germany at 13 stations fig 1a supplementary data table s1 approximately 200 g of sediment in triplicate was collected from each station wrapped in aluminum and stored at 20 c until mp extraction biological samples were collected at different stations using varying sampling methods that depended on the species fig 1a supplementary data table s1 zooplankton

stations by dredging stations 2 4 and 6 at depth of 8 6 14 2 m supplementary data table s1 a total of 20 species were collected for mp detection and to determine the stable n isotope compositions to calculate the tls the zooplankton samples were stored in vials and other biological samples were stored in aluminum bags at 20 c until mp extraction 2 2 sample pretreatment and microplastic extraction 2 2 1 water samples we referred to wang et al 2020 for the methods used to extract mps from water samples samples were filtered through 5 and 0 3 mm mesh size stacked stainless steel sieves using deionized water to separate the macroplastics and mesoplastics from the mps solid particles collected in the 0 3 mm sieve were transferred to a 500 ml glass beaker and digested with 200 ml aliquots of koh 10 v v and h2o2 30 v v solutions the digested solution was then filtered through 0 7 μm glass filters gf f whatman uk after filtration the filters were transferred to glass dishes covered with foil and dried at 25 c for further analysis 2 2 2 sediment samples the mps from the sediment samples were extracted following the method suggested by wu et al 2020 samples were dried to a constant weight at 60 c for 72 h a density separation method was applied to extract the mps during each analysis 50 g dry weight d w of sediment in triplicate was mixed with 400 ml of nacl solution 1 2 g ml 1 in a glass beaker and manually stirred with a clean glass rod for 2 min after sedimentation for 24 h the nacl solution containing the mps was transferred into another glass beaker subsequently 10 ml of h2o2 30 v v was added to 400 ml solutions for 24 h to degrade the organic matter the digested solution was then filtered through 0 7 μm glass filters gf f whatman uk after filtration the filters were transferred to glass dishes covered with foil and dried at 25 c for subsequent analysis 2 2 3 biological samples the methods by wu et al 2020 goswami et al 2020 and gong et al 2021 were followed for the extraction of mps from the organisms the biological samples were thawed and rinsed with deionized water for basic biological measurements such as the body size for crustaceans cephalopods and fish or the shell size for bivalves the tissues of each individual were freshly dissected and collected for mp extraction the tissues included the entire body for zooplanktons soft tissues for bivalves and crustaceans digestive tracts and muscles for cephalopods and gills digestive tracts and muscles for fish a total of 50 individuals for the copepod calanus sinicus 10 individuals pooled as a sample were randomly selected for digestion to identify mps abundance they were rinsed twice with ultrapure water and transferred to a 20 ml vial concentrated nitric acid hno3 10 ml was added to the scintillation vial and the samples were digested in a water bath at 80 c for 3 h the tissues of each individual for the other organisms 10 15 individuals for each species were directly transferred to a 500 ml glass beaker and digested with 200 ml aliquots of koh 10 v v and h2o2 30 v v solutions for 24 h after complete digestion the samples were filtered dried and stored similar to the water and sediment samples 2 3 microplastic identification and quality control samples in the filters were observed under a stereo discovery v8 microscope zeiss carl zeiss microimaging gmbh germany equipped with a digital camera oplenic c33 oplenic usa the mps including plastic like particles were quantified and photographed using the zen lite software followed by the identification of their morphological characteristics shape and size we referred to koelmans et al 2019 to classify the particles into fibers elongated thread lines thick and long fragments flat and irregular films thin and transparent granules irregular and roundish and foams vesicular to verify the accuracy of the visual observations the chemical components of all the particles including the plastic like particles were analyzed with micro fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy μ ft ir nicolet in10 thermo fisher scientific usa particles were measured under transmittance mode which involved cooling via liquid nitrogen the spectrum range was set to 650 4000 cm 1 via 64 co scans at a resolution of 8 cm 1 the aperture size ranged from 50 50 to 150 μm 150 μm depending on the sizes of the particles that were chemically analyzed plastics were identified as specific polymers by comparing the obtained spectra with the omnic polymer spectra library at a matching degree 70 wu et al 2020 for quality control we

water was assessed according to the criteria for the indexes described in supplementary data text s3 2 6 homogeneity of microplastic characteristics in different media the renkonen similarity index d

according to the shape or chemical components mps 0 7 μm ingested by infauna showed relatively high similarity 0 83 or 0 81 in renkonen similarity index respectively to those in the sediment where the infauna occurs fig 7 by contrast mps 0 33 mm ingested by pelagic species showed low similarity 0 16 or 0 14 to those in the surface water where the organisms occur similarities between the shapes or chemical components of the mps 0 33 mm in the surface water and sediment were low 0 33 or 0 17 fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 spatial distribution and characteristics of microplastics in the environment applications in source tracing there are significant spatial variations in the abundance of mps in the ocean ranging globally from 0 002 to 1602 for net sampling and 8 to 9180 items m 3 for bulk sampling xu et al 2021 compared with mps in other waters along the chinese coast 0 045 514 items m 3 determined via net trawling with similar mesh sizes 330 or 333 μm xu et al 2021 the mp abundance in the surface water 0 17 items m 3 of xiangshan bay was at a relatively low level in this study mps were more abundant in the inner bay than in the other parts of the bay there are a few explanations for this first industries are concentrated along the coast of the inner bay with an annual production of 5 5 million tons of plastic resins and one million tons of other plastic products wu et al 2020 plastic wastes originating on land are discharged into the water via the river influx which increases the abundance of plastic particles in the inner bay second fishing and mariculture activities can produce a large number of mps increasing the mp abundance in regions of intensive mariculture chen et al 2018 over 90 of the 16 km2 of mariculture algae mollusks shrimp and fish with an annual production of 0 28 million tons in recent years is concentrated in the inner bay a large number of plastic facilities e g nets floaters cages and rafts occupy these waters wu et al 2020 discarded or unusable plastic wastes from these facilities increase the mps source intensity this is supported by the fact that ps polymer and foam the two common materials used in floats for fishing and mariculture facilities were the most prevalent plastic polymers in the inner bay and were significantly more prevalent than in the other parts of the bay third ocean hydrodynamics play an important role in determining the spatial distribution and redistribution of mps in water the inner bay is almost entirely enclosed by land with low hydrodynamics it takes approximately 80 days for 80 of the water in the inner bay to be exchanged significantly longer than the 15 days required for the outer bay ning and hu 2002 consequently there is a disruption of mps diffusion or transportation from the inner bay to other waters facilitating the retention or accumulation of mps a similar spatial distribution of mps has been observed in other areas such as the bohai sea here mps were most abundant in liaodong bay which is farthest from the bohai strait and is characterized by the lowest self purification or water exchange capacity xu et al 2021 finally resuspension of mps from sediment via river influx or wind and storms can increase the mp abundance in the shallow inner bay 10 m in most of the water microplastics in the marine environment have diverse morphological and chemical characteristics the shapes and chemical components of these mps are important indicators for source tracing auta et al 2017 for example foam and lines are considered to commonly originate from broken fishery facilities such as floats and nets in xiangshan bay these two plastic shapes accounted for 64 4 of the mps this suggests that plastic debris from fishery facilities were likely to be a major contributor to the mps in the bay films typically originate from plastic materials used in agriculture such as film mulching or plastic houses for agricultural cultivation zhu et al 2018 in xiangshan bay films only accounted for 5 0 of the mps indicating that plastic from agriculture made less of a contribution to the mps in the bay dozens of polymers have been recorded in the global oceans with ps pe and pp being the most frequently detected hidalgo ruz et al 2012 while ps polymers are prevalent in mariculture areas hinojosa and thiel 2009 in xiangshan bay ps polymers accounted for 66 9 of the mps which were most abundant in the inner bay furthermore pe and pp two polymers also often used for the manufacture of fishing and mariculture facilities such as cages and nets accounted for 31 0 of the mps in the bay these findings further support the assumption that ocean originated plastic makes a large contribution to the mps in surface water of xiangshan bay in the sediment of the oceans there is significant spatial variation in the abundance of mps ranging globally from 0 97 to 7960 items kg 1 xu et al 2021 in xiangshan bay mps were detected in all of the sediment samples with an average abundance of 139 0 items kg 1 which is at a low medium level compared with other bays along the chinese coast 15 4205 items kg 1 xu et al 2021 contrary to that in water the abundance of mps in the sediment did not vary spatially across the bay particles 330 µm baseline size for the water samples in this study only accounted for a small proportion 8 6 of the mps in the sediment baseline size of 0 7 µm a comparison of mps 330 µm could provide information on analyzing the dissimilarity in their characteristics between the two environmental media specifically in water foam dominated the particles while fiber was minimally detected by contrast in the sediment fibers dominated the particles while foam was the least common fibers were likely to be missed by plankton net sampling because they can orient longitudinally and escape from nets resulting in their loss from the water samples based on the detected polymers pe and pp were common polymers in both media and ps was dominant while ry was rarely detected in water by contrast in the sediment ry accounted for the largest proportion of the particles while ps rarely occurred ry is a fabric made from cellulose fibers that are usually strengthened with synthetic additives as one of the most commercialized artificial fibers ry is frequently used for making textiles and personal hygiene products remy et al 2015 domestic sewage is an important source of ry in the marine environment lusher et al 2013 wang et al 2020 although ry particles are more easily degraded than those of the traditional polymers they are less degradable than the purified cellulose fibers this property favored the retention and accumulation of ry in the sediment of the bay for a relatively long period of time in contrast to the finding that mariculture derived plastics likely had a large contribution to the mps in xiangshan bay only a small proportion of the mps in the sediment were likely related to mariculture facilities i e foam or fragment for shape ps pe and pp for polymer microplastic deposition in sediment is primarily caused by the sinking of the particles presents in the water columns with a small proportion of particles originating from other sources such as waste dumping the fate of mps in the two media is also quite different mps in sediment rarely experience drastic changes in their abundance or distribution unless they are resuspended by natural forces particularly in low hydraulic dynamic environments such as xiangshan bay however mps in the water can be redistributed via diverse routes for example they can attach to other materials or be ingested by a wide range of organisms hence they can be transported anywhere in the oceans doyle et al 2011 markic et al 2018 a large proportion of mps are continually retained and move in water columns driven by environmental forces such as wind and ocean hydraulics sediment deposition tends to occur for high density polymer particles e g ry and pet and other polymers that lose buoyancy for various causes e g biofouling or aggregation foam commonly has a relatively low density and thus possesses a high buoyancy in water compared with other shapes such as fibers and lines this allows for the suspension of particles such as foam in water columns for relatively long periods considering these characteristics and the redistribution of plastic particles ry fibers high density in shape and polymer were dominant among the mps in the sediment although ps foams low density dominated particles in the water in other words mps in the two environmental media are not necessarily correlated or distributed proportionally 4 2 microplastic ingestion by organisms with references to their biological and ecological features in this study mps were detected in all species indicating that they were ingested by a wide range of organisms their abundances in the organisms also varied greatly 0 04 2 3 items ind 1 compared with previously reported results the mps in the organisms of xiangshan bay were at a relatively low level overall table appendix a the mp abundances in the environment had a significant effect on the mp ingestion by marine organisms even within the same species table appendix a other factors particularly the biological and ecological features of organisms also influence their propensity to ingest mps of the five biological groups investigated zooplankton minimally ingested mps in this study a relatively large dominant species copepod calanus sinicus 2 1 3 3 mm was investigated as a representative of zooplankton to compare their ingestion for mps with other biological groups although the low density foams were the most prevalent in the surface water where zooplankton occur they mostly ingested fibers i e the least abundant particles zooplankton commonly filter and ingest mps from the water the relative size ratio of the predator to prey plays a critical role in mp ingestion in the surface water foam commonly occurred as large particles and thus may have not been suitable for ingestion by zooplankton understanding the potential mismatch between the mp size and zooplankton feeding organs could provide information on interpreting this paradoxical result of the other biological groups fish ingested more mps than crustaceans and cephalopods fish commonly move and forage across a wider range of water columns than other biological groups they can filter a larger volume of water in different layers and thus more frequently encounter and ingest mps with a wider size range 0 14 4 8 mm by contrast crustaceans and cephalopods have fewer opportunities to ingest mps 0 18 3 6 mm because they generally swim slowly and reside in a limited layer of bottom water where plastic particles are usually less abundant than in the other water layers dai et al 2018 the feeding behaviors or habits of organisms can also regulate their ingestion of mps compared with predators filter feeders e g zooplanktons crustaceans and bivalves generally ingest relatively few and small mps by filtering particles from the environment predators such as some species of fish ingest mps with a wider size range 0 14 4 8 mm in more ways than filtering feeders 0 15 3 9 mm additionally predators can actively capture plastic particles that appear similar to food pellets ory et al 2017 all of these feeding strategies allow predators to efficiently ingest plastic particles finally predatory fish usually have complex digestive tract structures which favor the attachment and retention of plastic particles jabeen et al 2017 the mps ingested by organism are not necessarily always consistent with the plastic particles in the environment they reside in this study the mps in the infauna e g bivalves and mantis shrimp and sediment which were pretreated and determined using the same filter membrane 0 7 µm showed a relatively high similarity of characteristics by shape and polymer by contrast the similarity of the mps at the same baseline size 330 µm in the surface water and pelagic species residing there showed a low similarity either by shape or polymer first a mismatch between the spatial distribution of the mps in the water and the living habitats of organisms can partially account for the dissimilarity migratory species frequently move across the bay and open oceans while mps can retain in a relatively limited water space and remain in their digestive tracts for extended periods therefore the mps detected in the organisms do not necessarily reflect the particles in the waters in which they were captured second mp morphology can influence their ingestion by organisms for example foams that were primarily originated from mariculture facilities were usually large and conspicuous in color which could help organisms discriminate them from prey this could reduce the likelihood that organisms ingest such mp particles at random as is revealed in goldfish and palm ruff ory et al 2018 xiong et al 2019 finally particles such as foam and fragments are more easily egested than fibers qiao et al 2019 therefore mariculture derived foam the most prevalent particle in the surface water was negligibly detected in the organisms of xiangshan bay considering that the ingestion of mps by organisms can be influenced by multiple factors other than the mp concentrations in the water the mps in the pelagic species and surface waters unsurprisingly showed a low similarity with respect to their individual characteristics nonetheless given that the mps abundance varies in the water layers investigation of the vertical distribution of mps is necessary for accurately evaluating the similarity of mps in the waters and those ingested by organisms residing there in future studies 4 3 perspectives on trophic transfer and ecological risk of microplastics as mps can be transferred from the aquatic environment to organisms or from prey to predator the trophic transfer hypothesis for mps in aquatic food webs has attracted increasing interest from researchers diepens and koelmans 2018 gouin 2020 covernton et al 2021 currently mp trophic transfer in aquatic food webs has rarely been observed in field studies for example the mp abundance in the digestive tracts of fish did not show trophic transfer in a freshwater ecosystem garcia et al 2021 an analysis of published data did not reveal evidence for the bioaccumulation of mps from low to high tls in marine food webs miller et al 2020 nonetheless a review of recent studies indicated that marine organisms at lower tls appear to be at a greater risk of ingesting mps than those at higher tls walkinshaw et al 2020 mp trophic transfer in the organisms of xiangshan bay was not detected in this study examining the physical properties of the mps could provide information for explaining this phenomenon first the bioaccumulation of contaminants such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants pops involve a series of metabolic processes in organisms major processes include the assimilation and detoxification of contaminants in digestive organs transportation in circulation organs elimination in urinary organs and accumulation in biological tissues contaminants in the form of ions or molecules e g hg and cr can be transferred bioaccumulated or biomagnified from prey to predator liu et al 2019 however mps commonly occur in solid forms in the aquatic environment and are thus not easily digested or assimilated by organisms second mps larger than specific sizes cannot penetrate cell membranes for transport into the organs via the blood or lymph circulation systems accordingly the transfer of plastic particles from digestive tracts to other tissues or organs appears unlikely because neither the cellular nor intercellular transfer of such particles is physiologically possible batel et al 2020 for example ps particles 250 nm could only be adsorbed onto the intestinal tract and outer epidermis of zebrafish embryos van pomeren et al 2017 in goldfish larvae ps microspheres 5 μm were not enriched in the tissues yang et al 2020 translocation of pet fibers 62 μm did not occur in the tissues or organs of a daphnia jemec et al 2016 similarly no mps were detected in the muscles of fish and cephalopods in this study these findings imply that the majority of mps detectable in the aquatic environment using current techniques cannot participate in the blood and lymph circulations of organisms therefore bioaccumulation in the tissues and organs cannot occur third most of the mps in organisms were detected in their digestive tracts their abundance typically reflected the relationships among the ingestion retention and egestion of mps in the digestive tracts not the relationship with the tls of the organisms for example 10 d after offering prey containing pvc mps to a crab and a puffer no plastic particles were detected in their biological tissues but they were detected in the feces santana et al 2017 similarly mp particles fed to goldfish were thoroughly egested 72 h after ingestion with negligible retention in the organs of the fish grigorakis et al 2017 xiong et al 2019 considering these physical properties and the physiological processes involved in their transportation in organisms the trophic transfer hypothesis for mps in organisms should be addressed with caution in other words the mp trophic transfer cannot be appropriately assessed simply by testing the correlation between their abundance in organisms and the tl as is frequently practiced in field studies in current studies the mps detected in organisms only reflect detectable particles that may just temporarily remain in digestive tracts but will eventually be egested by contrast tiny particles which have the potential for bioaccumulation or biomagnification are barely detectable or countable to address this issue improving the techniques to detect and include particles of all sizes in all tissues or organs that can bioaccumulate contaminants e g livers kidneys and muscles is important nonetheless mps can function as carriers allowing other contaminants from the environment to enter organisms or transfer from prey to predator fossi et al 2014 diepens and koelmans 2018 for example higher concentrations of bisphenol were detected in fish with mps in their guts as compared with individuals with no plastic particles barboza et al 2020 therefore ingesting mps from prey likely creates a route for the transfer or bioaccumulation of other contaminants in food webs currently owing to a lack of standards or criteria for quantifying polymer toxicity the ecological risk of mps in the environment and organisms has not been adequately investigated plastic polymers are composed of a variety of monomers and polymerization reactions often do not attain completion during plastic production therefore unreacted residual monomers and additives occur in plastic materials several of which are hazardous and pose threats to the environment in this study three indices were employed to assess the ecological risks of mps in water referring to the hazard scores for polymers used in previous studies pan et al 2021 the overall ecological risk in the bay was at a low moderate level comparable to the levels in other chinese coastal waters such as the changjiang river estuary dongshan bay and the mangrove waters of southern china xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 pan et al 2021 given that mps composed of hazardous polymers are most abundant in the inner bay the ecological risk in this area was naturally higher than in the central and outer bays additionally mps are often attached to or covered with other contaminants owing to their rough surface structures and absorbency therefore the toxicity of the contaminants attached to mps should also be considered when assessing ecological or health risks in future studies 5 conclusions microplastics occur in the water sediment and organisms of xiangshan bay in the water mps were most abundant in the inner bay in the region concentrated with intensive mariculture operations mariculture originated plastics were a major contributor to the mps in this region the low hydrodynamics in the inner bay favors mp retention in the sediment the spatial distribution of mps did not significantly differ across the bay overall the characteristics of the mps in the two environmental media were heterogeneous in terms of shape and chemical components microplastic abundance ingested by organisms were related to their biological features and foraging habits overall fish ingested more mps than crustaceans bivalves and cephalopods while zooplankton ingested minimal mps filter feeders ingesting fewer mps and showing a preference for smaller particles than predatory species mps did not show trophic transfer behavior in the organisms overall the abundances of mps in the environment of xiangshan bay were at a low medium level compared with those in other coastal areas the ecological risks from mps in the water of the bay were at a low moderate level these were much higher in the inner bay than in the other parts of the bay briefly mps in the marine environmental media or organisms do not necessarily show high similarity in abundance or morphological and chemical characteristics mps in all tissues of organisms should be included when trophic transfer of mps is proposed or addressed the toxicity of other contaminants attached to mps should be considered at ecological risk assessment for mps declaration of competing interest none

16277,micropollutants mps released into aquatic ecosystems have adverse effects on public health hence monitoring and managing mps in aquatic systems are imperative mps can be quantified by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms with stable isotope labeled sil standards however high cost of sil solutions is a significant issue this study aims to develop a rapid and cost effective analytical approach to estimate mp concentrations in aquatic systems based on deep learning dl and multi objective optimization we hypothesized that internal standards could quantify the mp concentrations other than the target substance our approach considered the precision of intra inter day repeatability and natural organic matter information to reduce instrumental error and matrix effect we selected standard solutions to estimate the concentrations of 18 mps among the optimal dl models darknet 53 using nine standard solutions yielded the highest performance while resnet 50 yielded the lowest overall this study demonstrated the capability of dl models for estimating mp concentrations keywords micropollutant surrogate method high resolution mass spectrometry deep learning convolutional neural network 1 introduction approximately 440 million tons of chemical substances are released annually into aquatic environmental systems schwarzenbach et al 2006 these substances or micropollutants mps originate from industrial waste consumer products and other anthropogenic sources park and jeon 2021 previous researches have shown that mps not only accumulate in surface and groundwater but also in tap water charuaud et al 2019 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 this is due to the limited capability of conventional water treatment systems to remove a wide array of chemical substances homem and santos 2011 magureanu et al 2015 despite being present in low concentrations mps still have detrimental effects on different species including human health khetan and collins 2007 peltzer et al 2017 for example pharmaceutical and pesticide contamination causes species collapse and vitellogenin induction in aquatic animals and sterility and hormone imbalance in humans grover et al 2011 hong et al 2007 therefore it is essential to detect and monitor mps in aquatic environments to manage their existence and prevent harmful exposure to living organisms although mps have been recognized as an environmental risk establishing a water environmental monitoring system for their detection remains a challenge the wide variability of mps present in water systems makes existing analytical methods cost intensive time consuming and labor intensive carpenter et al 2019 furthermore the natural organic matter nom and instrumental error inhibit the detection of mps through mass spectrometry due to the matrix effect and interference with the measurement stability jeanneau et al 2007 strano rossi et al 2015 uyguner demirel et al 2017 high resolution mass spectrometry hrms partnered with a stable isotope labeled sil standard has been used to quantify the concentration of mps hollender et al 2018 hrms has a reliable mass accuracy 0 5 ppm with a fine resolution 50 000 full width at half maximum fwhm the sil standard may improve the precision and accuracy of mp quantification using hrms park et al 2018b despite these advantages sil solutions are expensive 100 usd mg incurring high costs for mp quantification toronto research chemicals inc sigma aldrich inc hence previous studies have developed alternative methods to quantify mps legeron et al 2017 punt et al 2017 however these methods require information on target compounds and only a few substances may be detected deep learning dl has been highlighted as beneficial in handling large amounts of data szegedy et al 2015 among dl methods convolutional neural networks cnns are specialized for extracting essential features from multidimensional matrices or images szegedy et al 2015 cnns have been applied in various fields such as image processing speech recognition and biological research young et al 2018 until recently only a few studies in the analytical field have applied dl kantz et al 2019 presented the applicability of dl for the classification of mass spectrum peaks their method eliminated 90 of incorrect peaks from the mass spectrum zohora et al 2019 identified peptides using mass spectrometry with a dl the developed model provided better performance for peptide identification than existing tools recently baek et al 2021 suggested machine learning ml and dl methods to estimate mp concentration without sil standards they demonstrated that nom could provide an alternative standard to estimate sulpiride metformin benzotriazole niflumic acid and tebuconazole concentrations however their approach had a limitation to expand the type of mps because mps were estimated based on the nom properties at a specific site the nom composition may be impacted by soil properties the type of habitat and the land use park et al 2018a wenk et al 2019 this study developed a rapid and cost effective analytical approach based on dl to estimate mp concentrations in aquatic ecosystems we hypothesize that specific sil internal standards could quantify the mp concentrations excluded from the target substance defined as a surrogate method voelker et al 2019 the surrogate compound has an unlabeled structure and chemical similarity with the target substance whereas the sil standard is synthesized by replacing elements in the molecular structure with stable isotopes such as 17o 13c and 2h clifford and madala 2017 tabata et al 2007 although the sil standard provides higher precision and accuracy than the surrogate standard the high cost of sil solutions is a significant issue for mp quantification mccord et al 2018 hence this study aims to improve this method using dl and multi objective optimization dl can enhance measurement accuracy when compared to the conventional surrogate method while multi objective optimization can identify optimal solutions of sil standards to estimate mp concentrations this method also considers the precision of intra inter day repeatability and nom information to reduce instrumental error and the matrix effect of nom this study intended to achieve three key aims 1 to acquire monitoring data on mps 2 to identify optimal sil solutions to estimate the concentration of 18 mps using multi objective optimization and 3 to introduce a cost effective alternative analysis method using dl 2 materials and methods 2 1 target micropollutants there were 18 target mps selected including four pesticides 12 pharmaceuticals one corrosion inhibitor and one per and polyfluoroalkyl substance pfas table s1 these compounds were selected as they have been frequently detected in high concentrations in water bodies and monitored due to their persistence and detrimental human health effects choi et al 2021 oh et al 2020 park and jeon 2021 park et al 2021 also classified these substances as priority hazardous substances based on their occurrence concentration and aquatic toxicity carbofuran and iprobenfos were classified as carcinogens while iprobenfos irbesartan losartan and tebuconazole were characterized with high bioconcentration factors park et al 2021 the remaining species were also categorized as compounds with high detection frequency and concentrations iprobenfos and tebuconazole are fungicides that inhibit fungal growth and biosynthesis cabras et al 1997 kwon et al 2015 carbofuran and metolachlor are insecticides and herbicides respectively which are effective in pest control for plant protection byer et al 2011 mayakaduwa et al 2016 most mps detected in this study were pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and sartan substances these compounds have been reported to exhibit acute toxicity to organisms kim et al 2007 pillard et al 2001 benzotriazole has been used as a corrosion inhibitor in various applications such as antifreeze and can also act as a drug precursor sease 1978 perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa has been used as a surfactant in chemical processes that can cause endocrine disruption of sexual steroids in humans chaparro ortega et al 2018 2 2 sampling and sample pretreatment nakdong river is the largest river basin in south korea with a drainage area of 23 647 km2 and a main channel length of 510 4 km approximately seven million people reside in this area and more than 10 million consume water from the river park and lee 2002 over the last 10 years the annual temperature and rainfall have averaged 15 c and 1253 mm respectively with rainfall occurring intensively from june to september seo et al 2021 our monitoring was conducted from june 2020 to december 2020 in 22 sampling points including mainstream and major tributaries e g geumho nam hwang gam and hoe streams fig 1 a previous studies reported that the mid and downstream were vulnerable to inflow from major tributaries geumho and nam rivers ahn and lyu 2020 seo et al 2021 the geumho river passes through the daegu metropolitan city one of the populous cities in south korea in daegu several wastewater treatment plants and industrial complexes are concentrated which results in a deterioration of water quality level the nam river is surrounded by agricultural lands which discharge contaminants from untreated livestock manure pesticides and fertilizers the gam and hoe streams are also identified as critical source areas because the water quality level of these basins does not meet the water quality standards the hwang river is one of the largest tributaries in the downstream which can affect the pollutant load in the stream water therefore these locations have been influenced by the introduction and change in the inflow of mps kang et al 2020 this study used 2031 ms data to estimate mps which are composed of orbitrap analysis results of the target mps table s1 grab water samples were collected in 1 l amber bottle without headspace each sample pretreatment was done within two days after sampling campaigns the samples were pretreated to remove impurities and concentrate the target mps fig 1a for the pretreatment we applied the method introduced by park et al 2018b each sample was filtered with 0 7 μm glass fiber filters gf f whatman uk and sample volume was adjusted to 1 l citrate buffer 80 μl ph 7 0 5 and the sil standard 100 ng in each sample were injected into each of the samples each sample was then subjected to a solid phase extraction spe cartridge to concentrate the target compounds the spe cartridges were manually packed with 200 mg hlb resin oasis waters usa 150 mg env international sorbent technology uk 100 mg strata x aw phenomenex uk and 100 mg strata x cw phenomenex uk to capture as many organic compounds as possible the mps were then eluted with a mixed solution of 6 ml of alkaline solution ethyl acetate methanol 50 50 with 0 5 ammonia and followed 3 ml of acidic solution ethyl acetate methanol 50 50 with 1 7 formic acid the solvents were then evaporated under nitrogen gas 35 c to about 0 1 ml each analyte was reconstituted with di

mass spectrometry hrms analysis for mp analysis 10 μl of each eluent was injected into a liquid chromatograph lc dionex ultimate 3000 xrs thermo fisher scientific usa connected to an orbitrap mass spectrometer q exactive plus thermo fisher scientific usa fig 1b a reverse c18 column xbridge 50 2 1 mm particle size 3 5 µm waters was used to separate the compounds two solvents a di water and b methanol both acidified with formic acid 0 1 with flow rates of 2 ml min had the following gradient elution conditions 10 methanol 50 methanol for 4 min 90 methanol for 17 min holding this condition for 8 min and 2 min equalization time for the next sample analysis park et al 2018b the substances reaching the orbitrap mass spectrometer were ionized by heated electrospray ionization hesi under the following conditions spray voltage of 3800 v 3000 v sheath auxiliary gas flow of 45 10 au ion sweep gas of 2 au and capillary temperature of 350 c ms was fully scanned at 140 000 resolution in the range of 100 1500 m z with an automated gain control agc value of 1 million and a maximum injection time of 100 ms standard solutions with concentrations of 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 50 70 100 200 500 1000 and 2000 ng l including sil 100 ng in 1 ml of each calibration solution were used for calibration the target compounds were quantified using an internal standard method 2 4 preparation of inputs to apply dl the preparation of the input consisted of three parts 1 converting the raw orbitrap hrms file into an mzxml file fig 1c 2 extracting a specific subset corresponding to target compounds sil standards check standards and nom information fig 1d and 3 establishing an input subset to apply cnn fig 1e three dimensional ms data from hrms contained peak intensities according to changes in retention time rt and mass to charge ratio m z rt is the time from injection to elution of a sample and m z indicates the atomic mass number divided by the charge number of the ion moldoveanu and david 2012 this study utilized rawconverter to convert the raw ms dataset into mzxml files for data preparation baars and perlman 2016 we also applied two built in matlab functions of mzxmlread m and mzxml2peak m to fragment and access the ms dataset input subsets were subsequently extracted from ms data including the peaks of the target compounds sil standards check standards and nom fig 1d the check standard contained information about the precision of intra and inter day repeatability for measuring instrument error strano rossi et al 2015 because nom has a matrix effect that influences the hrms analysis the nom information was included in the input subset cimetiere et al 2013 our nom information was composed of two molar ratios of hydrogen to carbon h c and oxygen to carbon o c the ratio of h c separates molecules depending on the degree of saturation while the o c ratio separates according to the oxygen levels wu et al 2004 after data preparation these input subsets were applied to the cnn model to estimate the concentrations of 18 mps fig 1e 2 5 estimation of mps based on dl mps were estimated based on dl using two steps 1 identifying optimal sil standards and cnn structure using multi objective optimization fig 1f and 2 estimating mp concentrations using the optimal sil standards and cnn structure fig 1g a common method to quantify mps is estimating the concentrations of sil standard substances in target compounds choi et al 2021 however this method requires a high level of expenditure and labor in which expenditure increases with the number of target compounds stokvis et al 2005 therefore we applied a cost effectiveness analysis between the number of standard solutions and quantification accuracy using multi objective optimization the standard solution types and cnn structures were optimized to estimate concentrations for 18 mps multi objective optimization is ideally suited for modeling by using multiple conflicting objectives in an almost real world scenario deb 2014 multi objective optimization can reduce equifinality in variable selections and overcome the disadvantages of manual selection pan et al 2018 a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii was adopted as the multi objective optimization method this method is one of the most efficient evolutionary algorithms to determine pareto optimal sets deb et al 2002 the nsga ii was computed with a population based algorithm comprising a non dominated ranking process crowded distance calculation elitist selection method and offspring reproduction operations herman et al 2018 this method has been widely used and verified to solve optimization problems in various fields such as hydrology and remote sensing baek et al 2019 shaygan et al 2013 this study utilized five steps to optimize the type of sil standards and cnn structures first the number of the sil standards and the quantification accuracy e g mean square error mse were assigned as multi objective functions in nsga ii second the optimization process generated solutions of the sil standard type from the nsga ii this operation randomly selected populations of solutions and weighed their rank by calculating fitness based on objective functions such as the number of sil standard and model performance here fitness represented the conformability of solutions that were adopted in the next generation third the cnn model was trained with the optimal type of sil standards and the model result was transferred to nsga ii fourth these procedures were repeated until the end of optimization finally nsga ii generated a set of non dominated solutions pareto optimal sets indicating the most fitted solutions the candidate points were composed of weak solutions that were removed from the population more details on the ngsa ii can be found in deb et al 2002 and the explanation of mse can be found in the supplementary information lecun and bengio 1998 suggested the cnn method to process multi dimensional data the cnn consists of multiple layers including convolution pooling dropout and fully connected layers fig 1 e and g our study implemented 13 types of cnn architectures that were awarded in the imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge ilsvrc as the most ideal algorithms to detect image data deng et al 2009 he et al 2016 szegedy et al 2016 fig 1e these architectures have been employed in various fields e g image recognition remote sensing and biology and their performance varies depending on the cnn structure and input features ardakani et al 2020 hong et al 2021 peng et al 2021 shanhua et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the cnn models were developed by adding or combining layers to the original structures blanco et al 2018 haweel et al 2021 kang et al 2017 this study focused on analyzing the cnn structures to estimate mps rather than ml as the latter showed a restrictive applicability to estimate mps in a previous study baek et al 2021 found that the ml had limited to estimate the concentration of mps with a liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms detailed information on each layer and the structure can be found in the supplementary materials these cnn models were implemented using deep learning toolboxes in matlab 2021a model development and training utilized the nvidia gtx 3090 intel core cpu i9 10 900 2 80 ghz and 128 gb ram this study adopted random sampling to divide the training and validation datasets based on observations a uniform distribution was selected to generate input subsets for training 60 and validation 40 previous studies have utilized random sampling with uniform distribution brion et al 2002 caruana and niculescu mizil 2006 numerous studies have also applied this ratio to the training and validation subsets arevalo et al 2015 frizzi et al 2016 peterson et al 2020 qian et al 2021 in this study r2 and mse were adopted for the model evaluation furthermore we calculated the akaike information criteria aic to quantify the model complexity and selection based on model performance and the number of variables akaike 1998 this is a useful method for selecting the best model based on the lowest aic score snipes and taylor 2014 the explanation of r2 mse and aic can be found in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutants concentration in water the concentrations of the observed mps are summarized in fig s1 the minimum maximum average and standard deviation of mp concentrations were 0 09 22 139 90 197 31 and 752 23 ng l respectively most mps were detected at high concentrations in the wet season except for five iprobenfos irbesartan tebuconazole metolachlor and valsartan according to park and jeon 2021 hydrological and environmental changes affect the transfer of mps to water systems during the wet season the combined sewer overflows csos are discharged into bodies of water thereby increasing the mp concentrations among the mps metformin cetirizine and benzotriazole showed relatively higher concentrations similarly choi et al 2021 reported high concentrations of benzotriazole and cetirizine 300 ng l around the nakdong river these substances are recognized as an emerging concern in the nakdong river basin since effluents and tributaries discharge into the river kang et al 2020 park and jeon 2021 furthermore kim et al 2021 remarked that the influent to this basin might be carrying a wider range of mps pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals and pesticides because it is home to seven million residents and 18 wastewater treatment plants release wastewater into it 3 2 multi objective optimization the pareto optimal front from the multi objective optimization is shown in fig 2 a yellow stars and gray circles represent the pareto optimal and candidate points respectively the pareto optimal points are the optimal design depending on the number of standards and mse while the candidate points are the total simulation results during the optimization process the optimal points consisted of the optimal standard type and cnn structure to estimate the concentrations of 18 mps the total number of iterations for each scenario was 15 424 and the run time was almost one month the mse value decreased as the number of standards increased for a lead of up to nine standards among the optimal fronts the optimal design with nine standards showed the lowest mse value while that with one standard had the highest value when the number of standards exceeded nine an increase in the mse was observed therefore model performance was proportional to the number of standards in the range of 1 9 according to li et al 2018 the excessive complexity of input variables can cause model performance deterioration in neural networks thus a peak performance can be achieved at a certain point and anything beyond that will result in poor performance tables s3 and s4 include the optimal designs provided by the multi objective optimization among the structures darknet was selected as the optimal structure of the cnn when the number of standards was greater than two previous studies have demonstrated the superiority of darknet compared to other structures e g vgg and googlenet fidalgo et al 2019 redmon and farhadi 2018 darknet 53 has proven to be useful in the feature extraction of multidimensional data jian et al 2020 and has exhibited high accuracy when used for object detection li and zhao 2020 on the other hand resnet 50 was chosen as the optimal cnn structure when the number of standards was one or two resnet 50 was first suggested by he et al 2016 and was structuralized by a residual building block rbb based on skip connections sun et al 2017 showed that resnet 50 outperformed other cnn structures in diagnosing drug resistant tuberculosis and identified the type of tuberculosis with high model stability baek et al 2021 also reported that resnet yielded superior performance among dl models in estimating mp concentrations using the ms subset of nom the optimization showed that resnet 50 is suitable for models containing a low number of standards 2 whereas darknet provides better performance for a high number of standards 2 among the standard solutions cetirizine d8 was most frequently used as an alternative substance in optimal designs that contained 2 4 and 6 9 standards optimal designs with 1 5 and 7 9 standards adopted fluoxetine d5 as an alternative standard this implies that these compounds could be useful as an alternative solution to sil and may provide reliable quantification accuracy several studies have used fluoxetine d5 as a surrogate standard pery et al 2008 used it to quantify pharmaceuticals in water and sediment samples schultz and furlong 2008 applied fluoxetine d5 and sertraline d3 to quantify ten chemical compounds 3 3 estimation of micropollutant concentration the models were trained and validated to estimate the concentration of 18 mps depending on the number of standards the performance of the models is shown in fig 2 b j and fig 3 a j the cnn models using nine standards and one standard exhibited the best and worst performances respectively the validation coefficient of determination r2 and mse of the model with nine standards were 0 84 and 0 49 log ng l 2 while those of the model with one standard were 0 74 and 0 81 log ng l 2 respectively the r2 increased as the number of standards increased demonstrating that the number of standards was an influential factor in improving model accuracy in addition the simulated concentration was underestimated when one standard was applied while the simulated concentration from the model with nine standards showed good agreement with the observed concentration however the model with more than ten standards deteriorated the r2 value indicating that nine is the best number of standards for the model sulpiride tramadol and valsartan acid exhibited r2 values above 0 85 during validation regardless of the number of standards this demonstrates that these substances can be quantified using a small number of standards the simulation performance of metformin and tebuconazole varied depending on the number of standards the model with one standard yielded 0 16 and 0 43 of r2 for metformin and tebuconazole respectively while the model with nine standards yielded 0 49 and 0 71 of r2 this implies that the quantification accuracy of these substances is vulnerable to the number and type of standard wang et al 2017 suggested that the selection of standard solutions influences the precision of quantification thakare et al 2016 recommended that the surrogate standard should be selected based on the features of the target compounds e g degradability hence the user should have pertinent information about the standard solutions and target compounds before undergoing quantification 3 4 comparison of model performance the ball charts illustrate the model performance for different numbers of standards at their optimal designs fig 3 a the ball size denotes the number of standards corresponding to the analytical cost efficiency wherein a smaller number of standards is cheaper for quantifying mps the aic value is a performance index that indicates the error between observed and simulated results bozdogan 1987 the darknet 53 model using nine standards and the resnet 50 model using one standard were the best and worst models yielding aic values of 550 48 and 161 31 respectively the aic and mse values decreased with an increasing number of standards in particular the aic had a positive relationship with the number of standards demonstrating that the effect of the model error overwhelmed the contribution of the number of standards when calculating aic zainuddin et al 2008 reported that the best model was determined by adding more variables with lower aic values previous studies also exhibited a linear trend between the aic and mse tularam 2010 ziembik et al 2009 the contour plots show the distribution of r2 values depending on the m z and rt at different numbers of standards fig 4 a to i this plot was generated through cubic spline interpolation to calculate the value of r2 by changing m z and rt mckinley and levine 1998 this can infer the model performance for unknown substances represented by m z and rt the distribution provided by the model using nine standards presented a higher r2 value in most regions compared to that using one standard in addition the regions with high r2 values became more abundant as the number of standards increased the metformin region 100 170 m z and 0 1 rt improved considerably as the number of standards increased the region from to 300 450 m z and 7 11 rt experienced a slight increase in r2 whereas the region from to 230 270 m z and 5 6 rt was weakly affected by the number of standards this reveals that our approach is limited in terms of improving the quantification accuracy in a specific region various noms e g humic and fulvic acid are located at 200 300 m z although the model included nom information the matrix effect was still present which hindered the improvement in quantification accuracy by the model in certain regions kujawinski et al 2002 according to wang et al 2017 the matrix effect negatively influences the ionization efficiency of an analyte resulting in the unreproducible quantification of mps this study implemented dl models and multi objective optimization to estimate 18 mp concentrations by complementing the alternative analysis method a total of 2031 ms data were used for the model training to employ the dl method we optimized the number of sil standards and cnn structures thereafter the dl models were trained using optimal standards and structures finally we investigated the influence of the standard type and cnn structure to quantify the concentration of 18 mps based on dl darknet and nine standards were recommended for estimating the concentration of 18 mps with reliable accuracy tables s3 and s4 the model performance was found to be influenced by the number of standards and cnn structure showing that the darknet model using nine standards outperformed the other models the new approach proposed in this study can reduce the experimental cost of quantifying mps by reducing the number of standard solutions further research will require additional monitoring with various compounds and sites which might increase the applicability and accuracy of the dl models because data driven models are developed using a large amount of data this approach can contribute to monitoring and managing mps in aquatic systems by adopting preemptive actions to mitigate the damage caused by mps hence the suggested approach could be useful in establishing mp monitoring systems for aquatic environments 4 conclusion this study implemented dl models and multi objective optimization to quantify 18 mps by utilizing a complementary alternative method the number of sil standards and cnn structures were optimized to estimate mp concentrations in addition a total of 2031 ms data were applied to the model training and validation finally mp concentrations estimated by dl models were compared with the observations the major findings of this study are as follows 1 most mps were detected with high concentrations in the wet season because of the hydrological and environmental changes metformin cetirizine and benzotriazole were frequently observed with high concentrations these compounds might have originated from industrial and urban areas 2 the multi objective analysis determined the optimal standard type and cnn structure to estimate the concentration of 18 mps darknet and cetirizine d8 were frequently selected as the optimal cnn structure and standard solution respectively 3 the cnn models using nine standards and one standard showed best and worst performance by exhibiting a validation r2 of 0 84 for nine standards and 0 74 for one standard it was revealed that the model performance is affected by the number of standards 4 this study compared the model performance using aic r2 and cnn types as the number of standards increased the aic values decreased while the regions with the higher r2 values were enlarged darknet using nine standards yielded the lowest aic value of 550 48 indicating that the model outperformed other models the new approach proposed in this study demonstrated accurate training and validation results to estimate the concentrations of 18 mps specifically cetirizine d8 and fluoxetine d5 were recommenced as standard solutions for alternative method providing reliable quantification accuracy this method could reduce experimental expenses to quantify mps through the use of an alternative method future research should focus on the additional monitoring of various compounds and sites potentially increasing the applicability and accuracy of dl models therefore the suggested approach may be useful to establish mp monitoring systems for aquatic ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16277,micropollutants mps released into aquatic ecosystems have adverse effects on public health hence monitoring and managing mps in aquatic systems are imperative mps can be quantified by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms with stable isotope labeled sil standards however high cost of sil solutions is a significant issue this study aims to develop a rapid and cost effective analytical approach to estimate mp concentrations in aquatic systems based on deep learning dl and multi objective optimization we hypothesized that internal standards could quantify the mp concentrations other than the target substance our approach considered the precision of intra inter day repeatability and natural organic matter information to reduce instrumental error and matrix effect we selected standard solutions to estimate the concentrations of 18 mps among the optimal dl models darknet 53 using nine standard solutions yielded the highest performance while resnet 50 yielded the lowest overall this study demonstrated the capability of dl models for estimating mp concentrations keywords micropollutant surrogate method high resolution mass spectrometry deep learning convolutional neural network 1 introduction approximately 440 million tons of chemical substances are released annually into aquatic environmental systems schwarzenbach et al 2006 these substances or micropollutants mps originate from industrial waste consumer products and other anthropogenic sources park and jeon 2021 previous researches have shown that mps not only accumulate in surface and groundwater but also in tap water charuaud et al 2019 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 this is due to the limited capability of conventional water treatment systems to remove a wide array of chemical substances homem and santos 2011 magureanu et al 2015 despite being present in low concentrations mps still have detrimental effects on different species including human health khetan and collins 2007 peltzer et al 2017 for example pharmaceutical and pesticide contamination causes species collapse and vitellogenin induction in aquatic animals and sterility and hormone imbalance in humans grover et al 2011 hong et al 2007 therefore it is essential to detect and monitor mps in aquatic environments to manage their existence and prevent harmful exposure to living organisms although mps have been recognized as an environmental risk establishing a water environmental monitoring system for their detection remains a challenge the wide variability of mps present in water systems makes existing analytical methods cost intensive time consuming and labor intensive carpenter et al 2019 furthermore the natural organic matter nom and instrumental error inhibit the detection of mps through mass spectrometry due to the matrix effect and interference with the measurement stability jeanneau et al 2007 strano rossi et al 2015 uyguner demirel et al 2017 high resolution mass spectrometry hrms partnered with a stable isotope labeled sil standard has been used to quantify the concentration of mps hollender et al 2018 hrms has a reliable mass accuracy 0 5 ppm with a fine resolution 50 000 full width at half maximum fwhm the sil standard may improve the precision and accuracy of mp quantification using hrms park et al 2018b despite these advantages sil solutions are expensive 100 usd mg incurring high costs for mp quantification toronto research chemicals inc sigma aldrich inc hence previous studies have developed alternative methods to quantify mps legeron et al 2017 punt et al 2017 however these methods require information on target compounds and only a few substances may be detected deep learning dl has been highlighted as beneficial in handling large amounts of data szegedy et al 2015 among dl methods convolutional neural networks cnns are specialized for extracting essential features from multidimensional matrices or images szegedy et al 2015 cnns have been applied in various fields such as image processing speech recognition and biological research young et al 2018 until recently only a few studies in the analytical field have applied dl kantz et al 2019 presented the applicability of dl for the classification of mass spectrum peaks their method eliminated 90 of incorrect peaks from the mass spectrum zohora et al 2019 identified peptides using mass spectrometry with a dl the developed model provided better performance for peptide identification than existing tools recently baek et al 2021 suggested machine learning ml and dl methods to estimate mp concentration without sil standards they demonstrated that nom could provide an alternative standard to estimate sulpiride metformin benzotriazole niflumic acid and tebuconazole concentrations however their approach had a limitation to expand the type of mps because mps were estimated based on the nom properties at a specific site the nom composition may be impacted by soil properties the type of habitat and the land use park et al 2018a wenk et al 2019 this study developed a rapid and cost effective analytical approach based on dl to estimate mp concentrations in aquatic ecosystems we hypothesize that specific sil internal standards could quantify the mp concentrations excluded from the target substance defined as a surrogate method voelker et al 2019 the surrogate compound has an unlabeled structure and chemical similarity with the target substance whereas the sil standard is synthesized by replacing elements in the molecular structure with stable isotopes such as 17o 13c and 2h clifford and madala 2017 tabata et al 2007 although the sil standard provides higher precision and accuracy than the surrogate standard the high cost of sil solutions is a significant issue for mp quantification mccord et al 2018 hence this study aims to improve this method using dl and multi objective optimization dl can enhance measurement accuracy when compared to the conventional surrogate method while multi objective optimization can identify optimal solutions of sil standards to estimate mp concentrations this method also considers the precision of intra inter day repeatability and nom information to reduce instrumental error and the matrix effect of nom this study intended to achieve three key aims 1 to acquire monitoring data on mps 2 to identify optimal sil solutions to estimate the concentration of 18 mps using multi objective optimization and 3 to introduce a cost effective alternative analysis method using dl 2 materials and methods 2 1 target micropollutants there were 18 target mps selected including four pesticides 12 pharmaceuticals one corrosion inhibitor and one per and polyfluoroalkyl substance pfas table s1 these compounds were selected as they have been frequently detected in high concentrations in water bodies and monitored due to their persistence and detrimental human health effects choi et al 2021 oh et al 2020 park and jeon 2021 park et al 2021 also classified these substances as priority hazardous substances based on their occurrence concentration and aquatic toxicity carbofuran and iprobenfos were classified as carcinogens while iprobenfos irbesartan losartan and tebuconazole were characterized with high bioconcentration factors park et al 2021 the remaining species were also categorized as compounds with high detection frequency and concentrations iprobenfos and tebuconazole are fungicides that inhibit fungal growth and biosynthesis cabras et al 1997 kwon et al 2015 carbofuran and metolachlor are insecticides and herbicides respectively which are effective in pest control for plant protection byer et al 2011 mayakaduwa et al 2016 most mps detected in this study were pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and sartan substances these compounds have been reported to exhibit acute toxicity to organisms kim et al 2007 pillard et al 2001 benzotriazole has been used as a corrosion inhibitor in various applications such as antifreeze and can also act as a drug precursor sease 1978 perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa has been used as a surfactant in chemical processes that can cause endocrine disruption of sexual steroids in humans chaparro ortega et al 2018 2 2 sampling and sample pretreatment nakdong river is the largest river basin in south korea with a drainage area of 23 647 km2 and a main channel length of 510 4 km approximately seven million people reside in this area and more than 10 million consume water from the river park and lee 2002 over the last 10 years the annual temperature and rainfall have averaged 15 c and 1253 mm respectively with rainfall occurring intensively from june to september seo et al 2021 our monitoring was conducted from june 2020 to december 2020 in 22 sampling points including mainstream and major tributaries e g geumho nam hwang gam and hoe streams fig 1 a previous studies reported that the mid and downstream were vulnerable to inflow from major tributaries geumho and nam rivers ahn and lyu 2020 seo et al 2021 the geumho river passes through the daegu metropolitan city one of the populous cities in south korea in daegu several wastewater treatment plants and industrial complexes are concentrated which results in a deterioration of water quality level the nam river is surrounded by agricultural lands which discharge contaminants from untreated livestock manure pesticides and fertilizers the gam and hoe streams are also identified as critical source areas because the water quality level of these basins does not meet the water quality standards the hwang river is one of the largest tributaries in the downstream which can affect the pollutant load in the stream water therefore these locations have been influenced by the introduction and change in the inflow of mps kang et al 2020 this study used 2031 ms data to estimate mps which are composed of orbitrap analysis results of the target mps table s1 grab water samples were collected in 1 l amber bottle without headspace each sample pretreatment was done within two days after sampling campaigns the samples were pretreated to remove impurities and concentrate the target mps fig 1a for the pretreatment we applied the method introduced by park et al 2018b each sample was filtered with 0 7 μm glass fiber filters gf f whatman uk and sample volume was adjusted to 1 l citrate buffer 80 μl ph 7 0 5 and the sil standard 100 ng in each sample were injected into each of the samples each sample was then subjected to a solid phase extraction spe cartridge to concentrate the target compounds the spe cartridges were manually packed with 200 mg hlb resin oasis waters usa 150 mg env international sorbent technology uk 100 mg strata x aw phenomenex uk and 100 mg strata x cw phenomenex uk to capture as many organic compounds as possible the mps were then eluted with a mixed solution of 6 ml of alkaline solution ethyl acetate methanol 50 50 with 0 5 ammonia and followed 3 ml of acidic solution ethyl acetate methanol 50 50 with 1 7 formic acid the solvents were then evaporated under nitrogen gas 35 c to about 0 1 ml each analyte was reconstituted with di water and methanol mixture 90 10 to final volume of 1 ml the eluent was filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter cellulose acetate advantec japan and kept at 4 c until analysis 2 3 high resolution mass spectrometry hrms analysis for mp analysis 10 μl of each eluent was injected into a liquid chromatograph lc dionex ultimate 3000 xrs thermo fisher scientific usa connected to an orbitrap mass spectrometer q exactive plus thermo fisher scientific usa fig 1b a reverse c18 column xbridge 50 2 1 mm particle size 3 5 µm waters was used to separate the compounds two solvents a di water and b methanol both acidified with formic acid 0 1 with flow rates of 2 ml min had the following gradient elution conditions 10 methanol 50 methanol for 4 min 90 methanol for 17 min holding this condition for 8 min and 2 min equalization time for the next sample analysis park et al 2018b the substances reaching the orbitrap mass spectrometer were ionized by heated electrospray ionization hesi under the following conditions spray voltage of 3800 v 3000 v sheath auxiliary gas flow of 45 10 au ion sweep gas of 2 au and capillary temperature of 350 c ms was fully scanned at 140 000 resolution in the range of 100 1500 m z with an automated gain control agc value of 1 million and a maximum injection time of 100 ms standard solutions with concentrations of 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 50 70 100 200 500 1000 and 2000 ng l including sil 100 ng in 1 ml of each calibration solution were used for calibration the target compounds were quantified using an internal standard method 2 4 preparation of inputs to apply dl the preparation of the input consisted of three parts 1 converting the raw orbitrap hrms file into an mzxml file fig 1c 2 extracting a specific subset corresponding to target compounds sil standards check standards and nom information fig 1d and 3 establishing an input subset to apply cnn fig 1e three dimensional ms data from hrms contained peak intensities according to changes in retention time rt and mass to charge ratio m z rt is the time from injection to elution of a sample and m z indicates the atomic mass number divided by the charge number of the ion moldoveanu and david 2012 this study utilized rawconverter to convert the raw ms dataset into mzxml files for data preparation baars and perlman 2016 we also applied two built in matlab functions of mzxmlread m and mzxml2peak m to fragment and access the ms dataset input subsets were subsequently extracted from ms data including the peaks of the target compounds sil standards check standards and nom fig 1d the check standard contained information about the precision of intra and inter day repeatability for measuring instrument error strano rossi et al 2015 because nom has a matrix effect that influences the hrms analysis the nom information was included in the input subset cimetiere et al 2013 our nom information was composed of two molar ratios of hydrogen to carbon h c and oxygen to carbon o c the ratio of h c separates molecules depending on the degree of saturation while the o c ratio separates according to the oxygen levels wu et al 2004 after data preparation these input subsets were applied to the cnn model to estimate the concentrations of 18 mps fig 1e 2 5 estimation of mps based on dl mps were estimated based on dl using two steps 1 identifying optimal sil standards and cnn structure using multi objective optimization fig 1f and 2 estimating mp concentrations using the optimal sil standards and cnn structure fig 1g a common method to quantify mps is estimating the concentrations of sil standard substances in target compounds choi et al 2021 however this method requires a high level of expenditure and labor in which expenditure increases with the number of target compounds stokvis et al 2005 therefore we applied a cost effectiveness analysis between the number of standard solutions and quantification accuracy using multi objective optimization the standard solution types and cnn structures were optimized to estimate concentrations for 18 mps multi objective optimization is ideally suited for modeling by using multiple conflicting objectives in an almost real world scenario deb 2014 multi objective optimization can reduce equifinality in variable selections and overcome the disadvantages of manual selection pan et al 2018 a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii was adopted as the multi objective optimization method this method is one of the most efficient evolutionary algorithms to determine pareto optimal sets deb et al 2002 the nsga ii was computed with a population based algorithm comprising a non dominated ranking process crowded distance calculation elitist selection method and offspring reproduction operations herman et al 2018 this method has been widely used and verified to solve optimization problems in various fields such as hydrology and remote sensing baek et al 2019 shaygan et al 2013 this study utilized five steps to optimize the type of sil standards and cnn structures first the number of the sil standards and the quantification accuracy e g mean square error mse were assigned as multi objective functions in nsga ii second the optimization process generated solutions of the sil standard type from the nsga ii this operation randomly selected populations of solutions and weighed their rank by calculating fitness based on objective functions such as the number of sil standard and model performance here fitness represented the conformability of solutions that were adopted in the next generation third the cnn model was trained with the optimal type of sil standards and the model result was transferred to nsga ii fourth these procedures were repeated until the end of optimization finally nsga ii generated a set of non dominated solutions pareto optimal sets indicating the most fitted solutions the candidate points were composed of weak solutions that were removed from the population more details on the ngsa ii can be found in deb et al 2002 and the explanation of mse can be found in the supplementary information lecun and bengio 1998 suggested the cnn method to process multi dimensional data the cnn consists of multiple layers including convolution pooling dropout and fully connected layers fig 1 e and g our study implemented 13 types of cnn architectures that were awarded in the imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge ilsvrc as the most ideal algorithms to detect image data deng et al 2009 he et al 2016 szegedy et al 2016 fig 1e these architectures have been employed in various fields e g image recognition remote sensing and biology and their performance varies depending on the cnn structure and input features ardakani et al 2020 hong et al 2021 peng et al 2021 shanhua et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the cnn models were developed by adding or combining layers to the original structures blanco et al 2018 haweel et al 2021 kang et al 2017 this study focused on analyzing the cnn structures to estimate mps rather than ml as the latter showed a restrictive applicability to estimate mps in a previous study baek et al 2021 found that the ml had limited to estimate the concentration of mps with a liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms detailed information on each layer and the structure can be found in the supplementary materials these cnn models were implemented using deep learning toolboxes in matlab 2021a model development and training utilized the nvidia gtx 3090 intel core cpu i9 10 900 2 80 ghz and 128 gb ram this study adopted random sampling to divide the training and validation datasets based on observations a uniform distribution was selected to generate input subsets for training 60 and validation 40 previous studies have utilized random sampling with uniform distribution brion et al 2002 caruana and niculescu mizil 2006 numerous studies have also applied this ratio to the training and validation subsets arevalo et al 2015 frizzi et al 2016 peterson et al 2020 qian et al 2021 in this study r2 and mse were adopted for the model evaluation furthermore we calculated the akaike information criteria aic to quantify the model complexity and selection based on model performance and the number of variables akaike 1998 this is a useful method for selecting the best model based on the lowest aic score snipes and taylor 2014 the explanation of r2 mse and aic can be found in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutants concentration in water the concentrations of the observed mps are summarized in fig s1 the minimum maximum average and standard deviation of mp concentrations were 0 09 22 139 90 197 31 and 752 23 ng l respectively most mps were detected at high concentrations in the wet season except for five iprobenfos irbesartan tebuconazole metolachlor and valsartan according to park and jeon 2021 hydrological and environmental changes affect the transfer of mps to water systems during the wet season the combined sewer overflows csos are discharged into bodies of water thereby increasing the mp concentrations among the mps metformin cetirizine and benzotriazole showed relatively higher concentrations similarly choi et al 2021 reported high concentrations of benzotriazole and cetirizine 300 ng l around the nakdong river these substances are recognized as an emerging concern in the nakdong river basin since effluents and tributaries discharge into the river kang et al 2020 park and jeon 2021 furthermore kim et al 2021 remarked that the influent to this basin might be carrying a wider range of mps pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals and pesticides because it is home to seven million residents and 18 wastewater treatment plants release wastewater into it 3 2 multi objective optimization the pareto optimal front from the multi objective optimization is shown in fig 2 a yellow stars and gray circles represent the pareto optimal and candidate points respectively the pareto optimal points are the optimal design depending on the number of standards and mse while the candidate points are the total simulation results during the optimization process the optimal points consisted of the optimal standard type and cnn structure to estimate the concentrations of 18 mps the total number of iterations for each scenario was 15 424 and the run time was almost one month the mse value decreased as the number of standards increased for a lead of up to nine standards among the optimal fronts the optimal design with nine standards showed the lowest mse value while that with one standard had the highest value when the number of standards exceeded nine an increase in the mse was observed therefore model performance was proportional to the number of standards in the range of 1 9 according to li et al 2018 the excessive complexity of input variables can cause model performance deterioration in neural networks thus a peak performance can be achieved at a certain point and anything beyond that will result in poor performance tables s3 and s4 include the optimal designs provided by the multi objective optimization among the structures darknet was selected as the optimal structure of the cnn when the number of standards was greater than two previous studies have demonstrated the superiority of darknet compared to other structures e g vgg and googlenet fidalgo et al 2019 redmon and farhadi 2018 darknet 53 has proven to be useful in the feature extraction of multidimensional data jian et al 2020 and has exhibited high accuracy when used for object detection li and zhao 2020 on the other hand resnet 50 was chosen as the optimal cnn structure when the number of standards was one or two resnet 50 was first suggested by he et al 2016 and was structuralized by a residual building block rbb based on skip connections sun et al 2017 showed that resnet 50 outperformed other cnn structures in diagnosing drug resistant tuberculosis and identified the type of tuberculosis with high model stability baek et al 2021 also reported that resnet yielded superior performance among dl models in estimating mp concentrations using the ms subset of nom the optimization showed that resnet 50 is suitable for models containing a low number of standards 2 whereas darknet provides better performance for a high number of standards 2 among the standard solutions cetirizine d8 was most frequently used as an alternative substance in optimal designs that contained 2 4 and 6 9 standards optimal designs with 1 5 and 7 9 standards adopted fluoxetine d5 as an alternative standard this implies that these compounds could be useful as an alternative solution to sil and may provide reliable quantification accuracy several studies have used fluoxetine d5 as a surrogate standard pery et al 2008 used it to quantify pharmaceuticals in water and sediment samples schultz and furlong 2008 applied fluoxetine d5 and sertraline d3 to quantify ten chemical compounds 3 3 estimation of micropollutant concentration the models were trained and validated to estimate the concentration of 18 mps depending on the number of standards the performance of the models is shown in fig 2 b j and fig 3 a j the cnn models using nine standards and one standard exhibited the best and worst performances respectively the validation coefficient of determination r2 and mse of the model with nine standards were 0 84 and 0 49 log ng l 2 while those of the model with one standard were 0 74 and 0 81 log ng l 2 respectively the r2 increased as the number of standards increased demonstrating that the number of standards was an influential factor in improving model accuracy in addition the simulated concentration was underestimated when one standard was applied while the simulated concentration from the model with nine standards showed good agreement with the observed concentration however the model with more than ten standards deteriorated the r2 value indicating that nine is the best number of standards for the model sulpiride tramadol and valsartan acid exhibited r2 values above 0 85 during validation regardless of the number of standards this demonstrates that these substances can be quantified using a small number of standards the simulation performance of metformin and tebuconazole varied depending on the number of standards the model with one standard yielded 0 16 and 0 43 of r2 for metformin and tebuconazole respectively while the model with nine standards yielded 0 49 and 0 71 of r2 this implies that the quantification accuracy of these substances is vulnerable to the number and type of standard wang et al 2017 suggested that the selection of standard solutions influences the precision of quantification thakare et al 2016 recommended that the surrogate standard should be selected based on the features of the target compounds e g degradability hence the user should have pertinent information about the standard solutions and target compounds before undergoing quantification 3 4 comparison of model performance the ball charts illustrate the model performance for different numbers of standards at their optimal designs fig 3 a the ball size denotes the number of standards corresponding to the analytical cost efficiency wherein a smaller number of standards is cheaper for quantifying mps the aic value is a performance index that indicates the error between observed and simulated results bozdogan 1987 the darknet 53 model using nine standards and the resnet 50 model using one standard were the best and worst models yielding aic values of 550 48 and 161 31 respectively the aic and mse values decreased with an increasing number of standards in particular the aic had a positive relationship with the number of standards demonstrating that the effect of the model error overwhelmed the contribution of the number of standards when calculating aic zainuddin et al 2008 reported that the best model was determined by adding more variables with lower aic values previous studies also exhibited a linear trend between the aic and mse tularam 2010 ziembik et al 2009 the contour plots show the distribution of r2 values depending on the m z and rt at different numbers of standards fig 4 a to i this plot was generated through cubic spline interpolation to calculate the value of r2 by changing m z and rt mckinley and levine 1998 this can infer the model performance for unknown substances represented by m z and rt the distribution provided by the model using nine standards presented a higher r2 value in most regions compared to that using one standard in addition the regions with high r2 values became more abundant as the number of standards increased the metformin region 100 170 m z and 0 1 rt improved considerably as the number of standards increased the region from to 300 450 m z and 7 11 rt experienced a slight increase in r2 whereas the region from to 230 270 m z and 5 6 rt was weakly affected by the number of standards this reveals that our approach is limited in terms of improving the quantification accuracy in a specific region various noms e g humic and fulvic acid are located at 200 300 m z although the model included nom information the matrix effect was still present which hindered the improvement in quantification accuracy by the model in certain regions kujawinski et al 2002 according to wang et al 2017 the matrix effect negatively influences the ionization efficiency of an analyte resulting in the unreproducible quantification of mps this study implemented dl models and multi objective optimization to estimate 18 mp concentrations by complementing the alternative analysis method a total of 2031 ms data were used for the model training to employ the dl method we optimized the number of sil standards and cnn structures thereafter the dl models were trained using optimal standards and structures finally we investigated the influence of the standard type and cnn structure to quantify the concentration of 18 mps based on dl darknet and nine standards were recommended for estimating the concentration of 18 mps with reliable accuracy tables s3 and s4 the model performance was found to be influenced by the number of standards and cnn structure showing that the darknet model using nine standards outperformed the other models the new approach proposed in this study can reduce the experimental cost of quantifying mps by reducing the number of standard solutions further research will require additional monitoring with various compounds and sites which might increase the applicability and accuracy of the dl models because data driven models are developed using a large amount of data this approach can contribute to monitoring and managing mps in aquatic systems by adopting preemptive actions to mitigate the damage caused by mps hence the suggested approach could be useful in establishing mp monitoring systems for aquatic environments 4 conclusion this study implemented dl models and multi objective optimization to quantify 18 mps by utilizing a complementary alternative method the number of sil standards and cnn structures were optimized to estimate mp concentrations in addition a total of 2031 ms data were applied to the model training and validation finally mp concentrations estimated by dl models were compared with the observations the major findings of this study are as follows 1 most mps were detected with high concentrations in the wet season because of the hydrological and environmental changes metformin cetirizine and benzotriazole were frequently observed with high concentrations these compounds might have originated from industrial and urban areas 2 the multi objective analysis determined the optimal standard type and cnn structure to estimate the concentration of 18 mps darknet and cetirizine d8 were frequently selected as the optimal cnn structure and standard solution respectively 3 the cnn models using nine standards and one standard showed best and worst performance by exhibiting a validation r2 of 0 84 for nine standards and 0 74 for one standard it was revealed that the model performance is affected by the number of standards 4 this study compared the model performance using aic r2 and cnn types as the number of standards increased the aic values decreased while the regions with the higher r2 values were enlarged darknet using nine standards yielded the lowest aic value of 550 48 indicating that the model outperformed other models the new approach proposed in this study demonstrated accurate training and validation results to estimate the concentrations of 18 mps specifically cetirizine d8 and fluoxetine d5 were recommenced as standard solutions for alternative method providing reliable quantification accuracy this method could reduce experimental expenses to quantify mps through the use of an alternative method future research should focus on the additional monitoring of various compounds and sites potentially increasing the applicability and accuracy of dl models therefore the suggested approach may be useful to establish mp monitoring systems for aquatic ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

antibiotics dielectric barrier discharge dbd combined with calcium peroxide cao2 as an innovative technology to attenuate sulfamethoxazole smx in sludge was investigated evident synergistic effects between dbd and cao2 were observed on the smx degradation with a synergistic factor of 2 02 moreover the energy consumption of dbd cao2 was significantly lower than that of dbd alone at a typical cao2 dosage of 0 1 g g ts and discharge power of 64 5 w the highest smx removal of 96 was achieved within 50 min the synergistic effects of dbd cao2 could be associated with the base catalysis of h2o2 and

dielectric barrier discharge calcium peroxide sulfamethoxazole waste activated sludge reactive radicals degradation mechanism 1 introduction the excessive use of antibiotics has led to the widespread occurrence of antibiotics in water environments liu et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered important receiving bodies of such emerging pollutants and hotspots for antibiotic spread into the environment liu et al 2018 in particular during conventional biological treatment processes of wwtps large amounts of antibiotics present in sewage are concentrated in sewage sludge due to sorption qiao et al 2018 making waste activated sludge was one of the most abundant reservoirs of these pollutants zheng et al 2019a for instance up to 87 of initial fluoroquinolones in sewage were ultimately found in dewatered was through wwtps jia et al 2012 antibiotic contamination in sludge samples from 45 wwtps in china and 10 in spain were severe up to 4328 21 335 µg kg li et al 2013 martin et al 2015 due to low biodegradability of most antibiotics large amounts of residual antibiotics concentrated in was could be transferred into environmental media during sludge disposal pepper

was since it can simultaneously achieve sludge stabilization and energy recovery wang et al 2019 however some antibiotics in was cannot be effectively removed by sludge ad ju et al 2016 zhang and li 2018 found that less than 42 of fluoroquinolones were degraded by ad liu et al 2018 reported that tetracyclines were poorly removed by industrial scale ad processes with total removal 18 furthermore the presence of antibiotics in was could inhibit ad due to their innate biotoxicity zhang et al 2021 antibiotics could inhibit the degrading bacteria of volatile fatty acids vfas and shift

inhibiting substrate utilization and biogas generation with a final collapse of ad reactor considering the low removal rate and ad suppression pretreatment is needed to remove the antibiotics before sludge ad advanced oxidation processes aops are commonly used in sludge pretreatment wang et al 2019 several aops such as fenton or fenton like oxidation have been reported to be effective in antibiotic removal in water due to the activity of hydroxyl radicals oh amina et al 2018 as a solid substitute for liquid h2o2 the calcium peroxide cao2 based modified fenton system showed better effect at neutral ph than the h2o2 based fenton system in removing various organic pollutants yuan et al 2019 improving the was dewaterability and ad performance chen et al 2016 li et al 2015 our previous research found that 27 reduction in volatile suspended solids vss and more than 50 removal of estrone 17β estradiol ethinylestradiol estriol bisphenol a and 4 nonylphenols were simultaneously achieved when cao2 was added to was at 0 34 g g total suspended solids tss for 7 d zhang et al 2015 therefore cao2 was preferred as the was pretreatment oxidant in this study for removal of antibiotics from sludge although cao2 can generate active free radicals that can degrade organic pollutants it is difficult to achieve satisfactory degradation in a short time using cao2 alone liu et al 2019a for instance 70 removal of estrogens in sludge required more than 7 days by cao2 alone even at a high cao2 dosage 0 34 g g tss zhang et al 2015 besides high dosage of cao2 inevitably increases the volume of digested sludge because of its solid form it is thus apparent that the combination of cao2 with other processes is more attractive and valuable for economic and environmental gains as compared to cao2 alone li et al 2019 previous investigations established that cao2 combined with ozone o3 ultraviolet light uv ultrasonic us microwave irradiation mw or heat could cause positive synergy on refractory organic pollutant removal and sludge solubilization li et al 2019 liu et al 2019a wang and li 2016 xiang et al 2021 zheng et al 2019a as an emerging technology combining o3 uv heat mw and us dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma has attracted increasing attention in contaminant removal in water massima mouele et al 2021a dbd treatment exerts a high voltage to ionize

2022 massima mouele et al 2021b dbd treatment only uses electric power with no need for any chemical additions and can operate automatically and compactly thus it is environmental friendly liu et al 2019b our previous research combining dbd and cao2 dbd cao2 showed synergistic effects on glucocorticoid removal in water liu et al 2019c aggelopoulos et al 2020 also reported a synergistic effect of dbd and cao2 in enrofloxacin removal in water however the synergistic mechanisms of dbd cao2 are still unclear and a microscopic model is yet to be established likewise studies regarding dbd cao2 for sludge treatment are still unavailable in the literature to date the mechanism of the synergy between dbd and cao2 in antibiotics removal from was remains a mystery that is yet to be unpacked thus this study aims to explore the synergistic performance and mechanism of dbd cao2 in antibiotic removal from was sulfamethoxazole one of the most widely used and frequently detected sulfonamide antibiotics in wwtps cetecioglu et al 2015 was chosen as the representative compound the dbd cao2 performance in smx removal from sludge was evaluated subsequently the underlying mechanisms of the synergistic effects of dbd cao2 were explored chiefly by comparisons between dbd based and cao2 based treatments and functional reactive species identification moreover degradation pathways of smx in was were proposed finally a comparison of cao2 alone dbd alone and dbd cao2 on sludge disintegration dewatering heavy metal removal ad performance and the microbial community of the ad system was performed the findings presented herein thus enhanced the applicability of cao2 and non thermal plasma technology and advanced the formation of a promising method for simultaneous contaminant removal

action sites of dbd and cao2 in sludge smx removal efficiencies in sludge solid phase and aqueous phase by dbd cao2 and dbd cao2 were compared after 30 min of reaction sludge was preliminarily separated into solid phase and aqueous phase by centrifugation 8000 r min 10 min and smx concentrations in the filtrate liquid and lyophilized sludge were measured effects of cao2 dosage and discharge

discussion 3 1 performances of dbd cao2 and dbd cao2 on smx removal in sludge 3 1 1 synergistic effects of dbd and cao2 compared with mono cao2 17 smx removal in 30 min and mono dbd 64 smx removal in 30 min dbd cao2 significantly enhanced smx decomposition 90 smx removal in 30 min fig 2 a the degradation of smx during cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 exhibited pseudo first order kinetics with r2 0 98 table s1 in si the descending order of kobs was dbd cao2 0 077 min 1 mono dbd 0 032 min 1 and mono cao2 0 0061 min 1 fig 2b the synergistic factor sf between dbd and cao2 was 2 02 calculated by eq s4 in text s7 tang et al 2017 which is higher than 1 confirming the synergistic effects of dbd and cao2 on smx removal in was meanwhile the energy yield of dbd cao2 of 5618 mg kwh was 1 4 times the energy yield of dbd alone 3958 mg kwh fig 2b indicating that cao2 addition reduced the energy consumption of dbd the synergistic effects of dbd and cao2 may be due to the increased yields of oxidative radicals such as oh and o2 when combining cao2 and dbd the o3 generated from dbd can combine with cao2 to promote the formation of oh and accelerate pollutant decomposition xiang et al 2021 in addition some physical effects i e uv and heat induced during dbd can also activate cao2 to form more reactive radicals liu et al 2019d zheng et al 2019b besides solid cao2 dissolving in moist media can produce h2o2 oh and o2 species which could oxidize the pollutants in was zhang et al 2015 the h2o2 released from cao2 can react with the o3 generated from dbd to produce more oh and accelerate pollutant degradation xiang et al 2021 moreover the dissolution of cao2 provides ca2 in the reaction medium a powerful lewis acid with which various ros can coordinate and be further activated for subsequent degradation aggelopoulos et al 2020 in addition the alkaline condition caused by ca oh 2 generated from cao2 can promote the conversion of o3 generated during dbd into more oh xiang et al 2021 at the same time alkaline conditions could also cause the dissolution of was and the release of smx from the solid to aqueous phases zhang et al 2015 thus promoting pollutant removal by dbd as shown in fig 2c cao2 was more conducive to desorption and removal of the adsorbed pollutant in sludge smx removal of 52 from the solid phase and 13 from the aqueous phase while dbd treatment favored dissolved smx removal from the aqueous phase smx removal of 63 from the aqueous phase and 24 from the solid phase the combination of cao2 with dbd enhanced the removal of both absorbed and dissolved smx simultaneously with observed effective removal efficiencies of 78 in the solid phase and 97 in the aqueous phase fig 2c as well as a total degradation efficiency of 90 in was 30 min fig 2a therefore the synergistic effects of dbd and cao2 on smx removal from sludge may be the comprehensive outcome of multiple factors as has been illustrated fig 2d 3 1 2 effects of discharge power and cao2 dosage as shown in fig 3 a the kobs of smx increased sharply with increasing cao2 dosage from 0 to 0 2 g g ts and insignificantly increased between 0 2 0 4 g g ts and then decreased between 0 2 0 6 g g ts oh ss reveals a tendency similar to kobs with cao2 dosage fig 3a indicating that oh played a dominant role in smx degradation with a substantive increase in cao2 dosage the production of ros and reactive nitrogen species rns increased during dbd cao2 treatment thus promoting smx removal seeing section 3 1 1 however excessive h2o2 released from excess cao2 could instead act as a oh scavenger zhang et al 2015 leading to a decrease in the kobs of smx fig 3a moreover a higher ph caused by the ca oh 2 from excess cao2 hydrolysis may easily decompose h2o2 to generate o2 zheng et al 2019b thus reducing oh production and kobs of smx in addition excessive cao2 may increase turbidity and plasma screening reducing the effective utilization of plasma for smx degradation liu et al 2019c fig 3b reveals the effect of dbd discharge power on smx removal during dbd cao2 the kobs of smx gradually increased with increasing discharge power from 0 to 64 5 w and then decreased from 64 5 to 79 4 w fig 3b during dbd cao2 treatment oh ss increased rapidly from 0 to 48 6 w and then insignificantly increased at 48 6 64 5 w and finally decreased with a trend similar to kobs fig 3b both the highest kobs and oh ss occurred at a discharge power of 64 5 w generally different discharge powers produce plasma with different electron densities liu et al 2019b thereby affecting smx removal in sludge at 0 64 5 w electrons in a stronger electric field can be accelerated to higher velocities resulting in more intensive particle collisions and more active species liu et al 2019b leading to higher kobs of smx from 0 006 min 1 at 0 w to 0 077 min 1 at 64 5 w however at discharge power over 64 5 w most of the increased energy was distributed in the form of heat rather than producing active species amina et al 2018 leading to a reduction in effective energy use in addition the higher discharge power over 64 5 w may generate excess h2o2 in the form of physical energy which can consume oh causing a decrease in kobs from 0 077 min 1 at 64 5 w to 0 068 min 1 at 79 4 w notably although the oh ss at discharge powers of 71 9 79 4 w were lower than the oh ss at 48 6 55 3 w higher kobs were observed at 71 9 79 4 w this could be attributed to the high intensity of physical energy and large amounts of hydrated electrons generated during dbd at 71 9 79 4 w liu et al 2019b eventually facilitating smx degradation however excess h2o2 could have been generated during discharge and possibly consumed oh radicals at 71 9 79 4 w leading to lower oh concentrations than those at 48 6 55 3 w fig 3b 3 2 synergistic mechanisms of dbd and cao2 on smx removal from sludge 3 2 1 comparison of smx removal rates among dbd cao2 and related chemical pretreatments 3 2 1 1 effects of multiple conditions generated by dbd combined with cao2 to explore the synergistic mechanisms of dbd combined with cao2 effects of h2o2 dbd gas including o3 and nox uv and heat generated from dbd combined with cao2 on smx removal from sludge was invetigated compared to cao2 alone smx removal efficiency obviously increased when combining cao2 with h2o2 dbd gas including o3 and nox uv and heat fig 4 a indicating that the dbd generated h2o2 dbd gas including o3 and nox uv and heat could activate cao2 to enhance smx removal the kobs of smx was in a descending order dbd cao2 0 077 min 1 h2o2 cao2 0 035 min 1 dbd gas cao2 0 022 min 1 uv cao2 0 018 min 1 heat cao2 0 014 min 1 and mono cao2 0 0061 min 1 fig 4b thus the h2o2 generated during dbd played a greater role in activating cao2 followed by dbd gas including o3 and nox uv and heat unlike external addition of thermodynamically unstable h2o2 h2o2 cao2 treatment the h2o2 generated from dbd was continuous fig s3 the continuous generation of h2o2 during dbd treatment reduced the disproportionation of h2o2 since not all the h2o2 is available at once as with liquid h2o2 zheng et al 2019a therefore dbd treatment may produce more h2o2 compared with direct liquid h2o2 oxidation and thus cause a higher smx removal efficiency during dbd cao2 the o3 generated from dbd can react with cao2 increasing oh yield and achieving a higher smx removal effciency under dbd gas cao2 than the removal efficiency under mono cao2 guo et al 2020 simultaneously the combination of the uv or heat generated from dbd with cao2 could enhance the production of reactive species such as oh and h2o2 thereby promoting the degradation of refractory organic pollutants he et al 2021 as the physical energy such as uv and heat released during dbd could be reused by cao2 addition of cao2 improved the energy yields of dbd fig 2b 3 2 1 2 effects of cao2 hydrolysates combined with dbd as shown in fig 5 both ca oh 2 and h2o2 released from cao2 promoted smx removal when combined with dbd the kobs of smx was in a descending order cao2 dbd 0 077 min 1 ca oh 2 dbd 0 059 min 1 h2o2 dbd 0 049 min 1 and mono dbd 0 032 min 1 fig 5b the ca oh 2 released from cao2 played a significant role in promoting dbd efficiency followed by h2o2 the ph value affects the properties of sludge as well as reactive species formation during dbd hno3 could be generated with the working gas of air acidifying the was liu et al 2019c by adding cao2 the ca oh 2 released from cao2 could neutralize the acid generated during dbd causing alkaline conditions which accelerate the decomposition of o3 and h2o2 and form more oh radicals thus achieving higher smx removal moreover the alkaline conditions caused by ca oh 2 could also promote sludge disintegration and release the adsorbed smx to the liquid phase thus improving smx removal during dbd fig 2c in addition ca2 can shield the inhibition of ions such as hco3 and co3 2 on oh and bind with the natural organic matter nom in sludge to eliminate the influences of these ions on radical capture zheng et al 2019a thus improving dbd efficiency furthermore the h2o2 released from cao2 could combine with the active particles such as o3 and nox hydrated electrons eaq and physical energies produced during dbd liu et al 2019c accelerating the production of oh and promoting smx removal 3 2 2 contributions of reactive species to smx removal in was 3 2 2 1 identification by oes and epr to further explore the removal mechanism of smx from sludge by dbd cao2 various reactive species in dbd cao2 system were detected fig 6 shows the recorded emission spectrum of the plasma plume in air over the range of 200 to 1000 nm excited atomic o 777 2 868 7 and 844 7 nm chen et al 2012 meta stable molecular o2 1 g 759 9 nm chen et al 2019 ionized oxygen atoms o 375 1 386 6 and 397 6 nm chen et al 2019 n2 337 1 nm chen et al 2012 n2 427 8 nm chen et al 2019 oh spectral band 306 2 320 0 nm chen et al 2014 chen et al 2016 and no β emissions 297 6 315 7 357 7 and 378 9 nm chen et al 2012 were detected in the plasma plume during dbd cao2 fig 6 these emission spectra indicated the existence of various ros and rns in dbd cao2 system bruggeman et al 2009 e g molecules o3 h2o2 and honoo radicals oh no2 o2 o and h ions o o2 no2 and onoo and hydrated electrons eaq due to collision between energetic electrons e and background molecules n2 o2 h2o etc as shown in eqs 1 11 wang et al 2015 1 o 2 e 2 e o o 2 o 2 e e o o 3 o 2 o o 3 4 h 2 o e oh h 5 oh oh h 2 o 2 6 ho 2 o 3 oh o 2 o 2 7 n 2 e e 2 n 8 n o no 9 no o n o 2 10 no 2 h 2 o 2 h onooh h 2 o 11 onooh oh n o 2 to further determine the main reactive radicals during dbd cao2 epr experiments were performed fig 7 a reveals the dmpo oh signal with four split lines at 1 2 2 1 of height ratio red solid diamonds indicating the existence of oh radicals in sludge during dbd cao2 treatment with sod quenching o2 reactions zhang et al 2015 fig 7b shows the signals of dmpo ooh six split lines with the same height ratio blue solid circle and dmpo oh with the addition of tba a oh quencher indicating that o2 radicals were generated in sludge during dbd cao2 the weak signal of dmpo oh in fig 7b may be the transformation of dmpo ooh zheng et al 2019a fig 7c demonstrates the appearance of a typical triplet peak of temp 1o2 1 1 1 green open pentacle sun et al 2012 indicating the generation of 1o2 in sludge during dbd cao2 in addition the triplet tempone signal from the reaction of tempone h with onoo indicates the generation of onoo during dbd cao2 with sod quenching the o2 reaction fig 5d the onoo active species have stronger reactivity than o2 radicals liu et al 2021 and are formed by reactions between no radicals produced by dbd and o2 radicals liu et al 2021 these illustrative experiments therefore confirms the existence of oh o2 1o2 and onoo in sludge during dbd cao2 treatment 3 2 2 2 identification by scavengers to find more evidence regarding the existence and contribution of various active species on smx removal from sludge a series of radical capture experiments were performed by separately adding scavengers of e oh o2 1o2 and onoo into sludge as shown in fig 8 e oh and o2 played important roles in smx removal the smx removal rates decreased with the increase of scavenger concentrations figs 8a e inhibition efficiencies were calculated to evaluate radical contributions as shown in eq 12 xiang et al 2019 12 i n inhibitio n efficiency k 0 k n k 0 100 where k0 is the rate constant in control kn is the rate constants in dbd cao2 with different radical scavengers as shown in fig 8f the kobs of smx decreased by 70 from 0 077 to 0 023 min 1 with the addition of 0 026 g g ts no3 indicating that e played a key role in smx removal from sludge the contribution of oh radical was also significant because the kobs of smx decreased by 67 from 0 077 to 0 025 min 1 with the addition of tba at 0 09 g g ts fig 8f since o2 radicals were observed by epr in was its contribution was also tested the kobs of smx decreased by 50 from 0 077 to 0 038 min 1 by adding sod 6 ku g ts fig 8f which confirmed the production of o2 radicals and their contributions to smx removal in was during dbd cao2 in addition inhibitation effects were observed with the addition of dabco and ua the kobs of smx decreased by 22 and 8 respectively figs 8d e indicating that 1o2 and onoo also contibuted to smx removal in was in general the inhibition efficiencies of various scavengers followed a sequence of no3 tba sod dabco ua fig 8f implying that the contributions of reactive species on smx removal in sludge during dbd cao2 followed the sequence of e oh o2 1o2 onoo 3 3 degradation pathways of smx in sludge during dbd cao2 the detected intermediates of smx in sludge by lc qtof are shown in fig 9 and listed in table s2 the mass spectra and chromatogram of these degradation intermediates are shown in fig s4 in total 12 transformation intermediates p 254 p 270 p 238 p 299a p 299b p 96 p 83 p 114a p 114b p 156a p 156b p 109 were identified table s2 the major transformation by products included p 238 c10h10n2o3s m h m z 238 04 p 254 c10h10n2o4s m h m z 254 04 p 156 c6h6no2s m h m z 156 01 p 109 c6h7no m h m z 109 05 and p 299 c10h9n3o6s m h m z 299 03 fig 10 the yields of the main intermediates p 238 p 254 and p 156 first increased and then decreased while the yields of p 109 and p 299 continuously increased followed by a continuous decrease in smx concentration fig 10 based on the intermediates detected and variations in their concentrations possible degradation pathways of smx in sludge during dbd cao2 were proposed as in fig 9 in summary there were four degradation pathways pathways a d for smx in was during dbd cao2 fig 9 in predominant pathway a p 238 was formed by removing the amine group from the aniline ring of smx then p 238 was further transformed into p 156a by cleavage of the c n bond in predominant pathway b p 254 stemmed from the substitution of oh to the amino group of the aniline ring of smx then p 270 c10h10n2o5s m h m z 270 03 was formed through oh attacking the benzene ring or the isoxazole ring in p 254 yan et al 2018 additionally p 254 can be transformed into 3a5mi through oh attacking the s n bond as observed previously amina et al 2020 3a5mi was subsequently converted into two isomeric intermediates p 114a and p 114b c4h6n2o2 m h m z 114 04 through oxidation of the isoxazole ring or the methyl group of 3a5mi in addition 3a5mi was converted into 3 5 dimethyloxazole p 96 c5h6no m h m z 96 04 by substitution of the methyl group to the amino group which further evolved into a smaller product called 3 methylisoxazole p 83 c4h5no m h m z 83 04 pathway c is the cleavage of the aminophenylsulfone and the methylisoxazoleamine bond of smx to form sulfanilic acid p 156b and 3a5mi p 156b was transformed into p aminothiophenol and subsequently converted into 4 aminophenol p 109 amina et al 2018 3a5mi was transformed into p 114a p 114b and p 96 as illustrated in pathway b additionally two isomeric intermediates p 299a and p 299b were also observed in our study pathway d they were formed by oxidation of the amino group in the aniline ring and hydroxylation of the aniline ring or the isoxazole ring zheng et al 2019c it is probable that the intermediates formed may be further oxidized into smaller molecules the intermediate byproducts toxicity of smx were explored via the us environmental protection agency toxicity estimation software tool t e s t based on quantitative structure activity relationships methodologies yi et al 2021 as shown in fig s5 the mutagenicity of all the intermediate byproducts was reduced into mutagenicity negative fig s5a the values of bioaccumulation factors of p 156 p 83 p 109 p 114 and p 238 were decreased compared with the original smx solution fig s5b similarly the developmental toxicity of p 83 p 114 p 96 p 109 and p 254 were decreased compared with smx fig s5c the results indicated that dbd cao2 treatment alleviated the toxicity of smx in was 3 4 sludge disintegration dewatering heavy metal removal and anaerobic fermentation performance the sem images intuitively reflected the degree of was disintegration after cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 treatments fig 11 a masses of cocci and bacilli were clustered together and embedded within the gel like extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix in raw sludge after mono cao2 the structure of flocs became loose and cracks in microbial cells fig 11a probably due to oh oxidation and alkaline hydrolysis of ca oh 2 released from cao2 after mono dbd there were obvious cracks in microbial cells and numerous clear holes fig 11a mainly due to the biocidal effect of plasma xu et al 2021 after dbd cao2 treatment the rigid gel matrix and cells showed the most serious disruption fig 11a leading to the strongest sludge disintegration effects compared with the mono dbd or mono cao2 treatments the effects of different treatments on sludge dewatering are shown in fig 11b the wc decreased from 85 raw sludge to 82 80 and 75 after cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 respectively fig 11b indicating that the performance of sludge dewatering was slightly promoted by cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 therefore dbd cao2 achieved the highest sludge dewatering efficiency moreover the sv30 value decreased from 94 raw sludge to 78 80 and 64 after cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 respectively fig 11b confirming the best sludge dewatering performance of dbd cao2 fig 11c reveals that the heavy metal contents in sludge solid phase decreased the most after dbd cao2 treatment indicating the potential of dbd cao2 to effectively remove heavy metals from sludge by solid liquid separation organic metallic complexes were formed in sludge with multivalent cations via electrostatic attraction or other interactions sheng et al 2013 during sludge disintegration by oxidation masses of entrapped or intracellular organics were released from the sludge phase into the liquid phase leading to the release of heavy metals from the solid phase into liquid phase li et al 2021a li et al 2021b notably after mono cao2 the concentration of cu in the solid phase increased fig 11c despite sludge disintegration fig 11a this phenomenon can be attributed to the precipitation of metals under the high ph caused by cao2 hydrolysis the effects of different treatments on sludge ad performance were also investigated figs 11d e the scod and vss solubilization increased significantly during ad after cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 compared to the control fig 11 d signifying the effectiveness of the three treatments in promoting sludge solubilization and reduction the scod and vss solubilization during dbd cao2 were significantly higher than those during cao2 or dbd fig 11d meaning that dbd cao2 achieved the best sludge solubilization hydrolysis and reduction performance the vfa accumulation by dbd cao2 was the highest 2537 mg cod l which was 2 2 1 4 and 1 3 times that in the control 1176 mg cod l mono cao2 1750 mg cod l and mono dbd 1788 mg cod l respectively fig 11d besides the acetate proportions in vfas increased after different treatments 32 for the control 40 for mono cao2 42 for mono dbd and 44 for dbd cao2 fig 11d several attempts have been made to enhance vfa production and the proportion of acetic acid during ad of was since vfas are high value carbon sources for biological nutrient removal in wwtps zhang et al 2021 the findings in this study show that dbd cao2 can also enhance carbon source recycling from was fig 11e reveals that dbd cao2 treatment significantly enriched the abundance of microorganisms responsible for was hydrolysis and vfa production especially the characteristic genera for acetic acid formation such as proteiniclasticum and macellibacteroides pang et al 2020 in summary dbd cao2 can not only enhance emerging contaminant removal in was but also promote sludge disintegration dewatering heavy metal removal sludge reduction sludge solubilization and acetate enriched vfa production sludge resourcization to the best of our knowledge it is for the first time that dbd cao2 is being put forward as a sludge treatment method and systematically evaluating its effects on sludge treatment 4 conclusions dbd cao2 showed significant synergistic effects for smx decomposition in sludge with a synergistic factor of 2 02 the cao2 addition significantly reduced the energy consumption of dbd compared to using mono dbd the synergistic effects of dbd cao2 were mainly attributed to base catalysis of h2o2 and o3 uv base photolysis peroxone oxidation and photocatalytic h2o2 dbd cao2 generated various ros and rns that contributed to smx removal the contributions of these reactive species followed the sequence of e oh o2 1o2 onoo based on the detected intermediates and their variations in concentration during treatment a probable degradation pathway of smx in sludge was proposed dbd cao2 not only enhanced smx attenuation in sludge but also promoted sludge disintegration dewatering heavy metal removal sludge reduction sludge solubilization and acetate enriched vfa production sludge resourcization therefore dbd cao2 could be considered as a novel efficient and eco friendly aop for sludge treatment credit authorship contribution statement

16278,large amounts of antibiotics are concentrated in waste activated sludge was and released into the environment it is thus critical to develop advanced sludge treatment technology to remove these antibiotics dielectric barrier discharge dbd combined with calcium peroxide cao2 as an innovative technology to attenuate sulfamethoxazole smx in sludge was investigated evident synergistic effects between dbd and cao2 were observed on the smx degradation with a synergistic factor of 2 02 moreover the energy consumption of dbd cao2 was significantly lower than that of dbd alone at a typical cao2 dosage of 0 1 g g ts and discharge power of 64 5 w the highest smx removal of 96 was achieved within 50 min the synergistic effects of dbd cao2 could be associated with the base catalysis of h2o2 and o3 uv base photolysis peroxone oxidation and photocatalytic h2o2 dbd cao2 generated various reactive oxygen species ros and nitrogen species rns that participated in smx removal the contributions of these reactive species followed the sequence of e oh o2 1o2 onoo based on the detected transformation by products and their variations during treatment a plausible smx degradation pathway in sludge was proposed besides dbd cao2 also promoted sludge disintegration dewatering heavy metal removal sludge reduction sludge solubilization and acetate enriched volatile fatty acid vfa production therefore dbd cao2 exhibited great potential for controlling antibiotic as well as promoting sludge reduction decontamination and resourcization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dielectric barrier discharge calcium peroxide sulfamethoxazole waste activated sludge reactive radicals degradation mechanism 1 introduction the excessive use of antibiotics has led to the widespread occurrence of antibiotics in water environments liu et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered important receiving bodies of such emerging pollutants and hotspots for antibiotic spread into the environment liu et al 2018 in particular during conventional biological treatment processes of wwtps large amounts of antibiotics present in sewage are concentrated in sewage sludge due to sorption qiao et al 2018 making waste activated sludge was one of the most abundant reservoirs of these pollutants zheng et al 2019a for instance up to 87 of initial fluoroquinolones in sewage were ultimately found in dewatered was through wwtps jia et al 2012 antibiotic contamination in sludge samples from 45 wwtps in china and 10 in spain were severe up to 4328 21 335 µg kg li et al 2013 martin et al 2015 due to low biodegradability of most antibiotics large amounts of residual antibiotics concentrated in was could be transferred into environmental media during sludge disposal pepper et al 2018 causing serious impacts on ecosystems therefore it is critical to develop effective ways to remove antibiotics in was before final disposal anaerobic digestion ad is widely applied to treat was since it can simultaneously achieve sludge stabilization and energy recovery wang et al 2019 however some antibiotics in was cannot be effectively removed by sludge ad ju et al 2016 zhang and li 2018 found that less than 42 of fluoroquinolones were degraded by ad liu et al 2018 reported that tetracyclines were poorly removed by industrial scale ad processes with total removal 18 furthermore the presence of antibiotics in was could inhibit ad due to their innate biotoxicity zhang et al 2021 antibiotics could inhibit the degrading bacteria of volatile fatty acids vfas and shift acetoclastic methanogens to hydrogenotrophic methanogens cheng et al 2018 cetecioglu et al 2015 reported that high levels of sulfamethoxazole smx had toxic effects on the anaerobic microbial community inhibiting substrate utilization and biogas generation with a final collapse of ad reactor considering the low removal rate and ad suppression pretreatment is needed to remove the antibiotics before sludge ad advanced oxidation processes aops are commonly used in sludge pretreatment wang et al 2019 several aops such as fenton or fenton like oxidation have been reported to be effective in antibiotic removal in water due to the activity of hydroxyl radicals oh amina et al 2018 as a solid substitute for liquid h2o2 the calcium peroxide cao2 based modified fenton system showed better effect at neutral ph than the h2o2 based fenton system in removing various organic pollutants yuan et al 2019 improving the was dewaterability and ad performance chen et al 2016 li et al 2015 our previous research found that 27 reduction in volatile suspended solids vss and more than 50 removal of estrone 17β estradiol ethinylestradiol estriol bisphenol a and 4 nonylphenols were simultaneously achieved when cao2 was added to was at 0 34 g g total suspended solids tss for 7 d zhang et al 2015 therefore cao2 was preferred as the was pretreatment oxidant in this study for removal of antibiotics from sludge although cao2 can generate active free radicals that can degrade organic pollutants it is difficult to achieve satisfactory degradation in a short time using cao2 alone liu et al 2019a for instance 70 removal of estrogens in sludge required more than 7 days by cao2 alone even at a high cao2 dosage 0 34 g g tss zhang et al 2015 besides high dosage of cao2 inevitably increases the volume of digested sludge because of its solid form it is thus apparent that the combination of cao2 with other processes is more attractive and valuable for economic and environmental gains as compared to cao2 alone li et al 2019 previous investigations established that cao2 combined with ozone o3 ultraviolet light uv ultrasonic us microwave irradiation mw or heat could cause positive synergy on refractory organic pollutant removal and sludge solubilization li et al 2019 liu et al 2019a wang and li 2016 xiang et al 2021 zheng et al 2019a as an emerging technology combining o3 uv heat mw and us dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma has attracted increasing attention in contaminant removal in water massima mouele et al 2021a dbd treatment exerts a high voltage to ionize gases between two electrodes to generate free radicals oh superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 uv us heat electrons e o3 and h2o2 which can oxidize and mineralize contaminants aggelopoulos 2022 massima mouele et al 2021b dbd treatment only uses electric power with no need for any chemical additions and can operate automatically and compactly thus it is environmental friendly liu et al 2019b our previous research combining dbd and cao2 dbd cao2 showed synergistic effects on glucocorticoid removal in water liu et al 2019c aggelopoulos et al 2020 also reported a synergistic effect of dbd and cao2 in enrofloxacin removal in water however the synergistic mechanisms of dbd cao2 are still unclear and a microscopic model is yet to be established likewise studies regarding dbd cao2 for sludge treatment are still unavailable in the literature to date the mechanism of the synergy between dbd and cao2 in antibiotics removal from was remains a mystery that is yet to be unpacked thus this study aims to explore the synergistic performance and mechanism of dbd cao2 in antibiotic removal from was sulfamethoxazole one of the most widely used and frequently detected sulfonamide antibiotics in wwtps cetecioglu et al 2015 was chosen as the representative compound the dbd cao2 performance in smx removal from sludge was evaluated subsequently the underlying mechanisms of the synergistic effects of dbd cao2 were explored chiefly by comparisons between dbd based and cao2 based treatments and functional reactive species identification moreover degradation pathways of smx in was were proposed finally a comparison of cao2 alone dbd alone and dbd cao2 on sludge disintegration dewatering heavy metal removal ad performance and the microbial community of the ad system was performed the findings presented herein thus enhanced the applicability of cao2 and non thermal plasma technology and advanced the formation of a promising method for simultaneous contaminant removal and carbon recovery during sludge treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 was and chemicals was was obtained from a secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtp in shanghai china characteristics of the wwtp

experiments for was pretreatments to determine the performances of dbd cao2 and the corresponding pretreatments on smx removal from sludge batch experiments were carried out in 100 ml glass bottles cao2 based treatments and a dbd reactor dbd based treatments initial smx concentration in sludge was set at 3 mg g total solids ts for mono dbd treatment 50 ml of was spiked with smx was introduced into the dbd reactor high voltage plasma was used to treat was at specific discharge powers the discharge power was calculated via lissajous figure as illustrated in text s3 for mono cao2 treatment 50

action sites of dbd and cao2 in sludge smx removal efficiencies in sludge solid phase and aqueous phase by dbd cao2 and dbd cao2 were compared after 30 min of reaction sludge was preliminarily separated into solid phase and aqueous phase by centrifugation 8000 r min 10 min and smx concentrations in the filtrate liquid and lyophilized sludge were measured effects of cao2 dosage and discharge

enclosed quartz dish placed in the dbd reactor to obtain a uv intensity equivalent to the intensity of dbd cao2 was containing smx was degraded by cao2 combining with the uv generated during discharge fig s1 in si to evaluate the effect of heat cao2 during dbd cao2 treatment the temperature changes of was during dbd discharge were recorded with a thermal imaging camera 322 pro fotric shanghai china subsequently was containing smx was mixed with cao2 and heated to the same temperature as dbd by a water bath for dbd gas cao2 treatment dbd treated plasma working gas was introduced into a flask to mix with was containing smx and cao2 to obtain o3 and nox dosages equivalent to dbd cao2 fig s2 for h2o2 cao2 treatment h2o2 dosage was set to the equivalent dosage generated by dbd fig s3 a

discussion 3 1 performances of dbd cao2 and dbd cao2 on smx removal in sludge 3 1 1 synergistic effects of dbd and cao2 compared with mono cao2 17 smx removal in 30 min and mono dbd 64 smx removal in 30 min dbd cao2 significantly enhanced smx decomposition 90 smx removal in 30 min fig 2 a the degradation of smx during cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 exhibited pseudo first order kinetics with r2 0 98 table s1 in si the descending order of kobs was dbd cao2 0 077 min 1 mono dbd 0 032 min 1 and mono cao2 0 0061 min 1 fig 2b the synergistic factor sf between dbd and cao2 was 2 02 calculated by eq s4 in text s7 tang et al 2017 which is higher than 1 confirming the synergistic effects of dbd and cao2 on smx removal in was meanwhile the energy yield of dbd cao2 of 5618 mg kwh was 1 4 times the energy yield of dbd alone 3958 mg kwh fig 2b indicating that cao2 addition reduced the energy consumption of dbd the synergistic effects of dbd and cao2 may be due to the increased yields of oxidative radicals such as oh and o2 when combining cao2 and dbd the o3 generated from dbd can combine with cao2 to promote the formation of oh and accelerate pollutant decomposition xiang et al 2021 in addition some physical effects i e uv and heat induced during dbd can also activate cao2 to form more reactive radicals liu et al 2019d zheng et al 2019b besides solid cao2 dissolving in moist media can produce h2o2 oh and o2 species which could oxidize the pollutants in was zhang et al 2015 the h2o2 released from cao2 can react with the o3 generated from dbd to produce more oh and accelerate pollutant degradation xiang et al 2021 moreover the dissolution of cao2 provides ca2 in the reaction medium a powerful lewis acid with which various ros can coordinate and be further activated for subsequent degradation aggelopoulos et al 2020 in addition the alkaline condition caused by ca oh 2 generated from cao2 can promote the conversion of o3 generated during dbd into more oh xiang et al 2021 at the same time alkaline conditions could also cause the dissolution of was and the release of smx from the solid to aqueous phases zhang et al 2015 thus promoting pollutant removal by dbd as shown in fig 2c cao2 was more conducive to desorption and removal of the adsorbed pollutant in sludge smx removal of 52 from the solid phase and 13 from the aqueous phase while dbd treatment favored dissolved smx removal from the aqueous phase smx removal of 63 from the aqueous phase and 24 from the solid phase the combination of cao2 with dbd enhanced the removal of both absorbed and dissolved smx simultaneously with observed effective removal efficiencies of 78 in the solid phase and 97 in the aqueous phase fig 2c as well as a total degradation efficiency of 90 in was 30 min fig 2a therefore the synergistic effects of dbd and cao2 on smx removal from sludge may be the comprehensive outcome of multiple factors as has been illustrated fig 2d 3 1 2 effects of discharge power and cao2 dosage as shown in fig 3 a the kobs of smx increased sharply with increasing cao2 dosage from 0 to 0 2 g g ts and insignificantly increased between 0 2 0 4 g g ts and then decreased between 0 2 0 6 g g ts oh ss reveals a tendency similar to kobs with cao2 dosage fig 3a indicating that oh played a dominant role in smx degradation with a substantive increase in cao2 dosage the production of ros and reactive nitrogen species rns increased during dbd cao2 treatment thus promoting smx removal seeing section 3 1 1 however excessive h2o2 released from excess cao2 could instead act as a oh scavenger zhang et al 2015 leading to a decrease in the kobs of smx fig 3a moreover a higher ph caused by the ca oh 2 from excess cao2 hydrolysis may easily decompose h2o2 to generate o2 zheng et al 2019b thus reducing oh production and kobs of smx in addition excessive cao2 may increase turbidity and plasma screening reducing the effective utilization of plasma for smx degradation liu et al 2019c fig 3b reveals the effect of dbd discharge power on smx removal during dbd cao2 the kobs of smx gradually increased with increasing discharge power from 0 to 64 5 w and then decreased from 64 5 to 79 4 w fig 3b during dbd cao2 treatment oh ss increased rapidly from 0 to 48 6 w and then insignificantly increased at 48 6 64 5 w and finally decreased with a trend similar to kobs fig 3b both the highest kobs and oh ss occurred at a discharge power of 64 5 w generally different discharge powers produce plasma with different electron densities liu et al 2019b thereby affecting smx removal in sludge at 0 64 5 w electrons in a stronger electric field can be accelerated to higher velocities resulting in more intensive particle collisions and more active species liu et al 2019b leading to higher kobs of smx from 0 006 min 1 at 0 w to 0 077 min 1 at 64 5 w however at discharge power over 64 5 w most of the increased energy was distributed in the form of heat rather than producing active species amina et al 2018 leading to a reduction in effective energy use in addition the higher discharge power over 64 5 w may generate excess h2o2 in the form of physical energy which can consume oh causing a decrease in kobs from 0 077 min 1 at 64 5 w to 0 068 min 1 at 79 4 w notably although the oh ss at discharge powers of 71 9 79 4 w were lower than the oh ss at 48 6 55 3 w higher kobs were observed at 71 9 79 4 w this could be attributed to the high intensity of physical energy and large amounts of hydrated electrons generated during dbd at 71 9 79 4 w liu et al 2019b eventually facilitating smx degradation however excess h2o2 could have been generated during discharge and possibly consumed oh radicals at 71 9 79 4 w leading to lower oh concentrations than those at 48 6 55 3 w fig 3b 3 2 synergistic mechanisms of dbd and cao2 on smx removal from sludge 3 2 1 comparison of smx removal rates among dbd cao2 and related chemical pretreatments 3 2 1 1 effects of multiple conditions generated by dbd combined with cao2 to explore the synergistic mechanisms of dbd combined with cao2 effects of h2o2 dbd gas including o3 and nox uv and heat generated from dbd combined with cao2 on smx removal from sludge was invetigated compared to cao2 alone smx removal efficiency obviously increased when combining cao2 with h2o2 dbd gas including o3 and nox uv and heat fig 4 a indicating that the dbd generated h2o2 dbd gas including o3 and nox uv and heat could activate cao2 to enhance smx removal the kobs of smx was in a descending order dbd cao2 0 077 min 1 h2o2 cao2 0 035 min 1 dbd gas cao2 0 022 min 1 uv cao2 0 018 min 1 heat cao2 0 014 min 1 and mono cao2 0 0061 min 1 fig 4b thus the h2o2 generated during dbd played a greater role in activating cao2 followed by dbd gas including o3 and nox uv and heat unlike external addition of thermodynamically unstable h2o2 h2o2 cao2 treatment the h2o2 generated from dbd was continuous fig s3 the continuous generation of h2o2 during dbd treatment reduced the disproportionation of h2o2 since not all the h2o2 is available at once as with liquid h2o2 zheng et al 2019a therefore dbd treatment may produce more h2o2 compared with direct liquid h2o2 oxidation and thus cause a higher smx removal efficiency during dbd cao2 the o3 generated from dbd can react with cao2 increasing oh yield and achieving a higher smx removal effciency under dbd gas cao2 than the removal efficiency under mono cao2 guo et al 2020 simultaneously the combination of the uv or heat generated from dbd with cao2 could enhance the production of reactive species such as oh and h2o2 thereby promoting the degradation of refractory organic pollutants he et al 2021 as the physical energy such as uv and heat released during dbd could be reused by cao2 addition of cao2 improved the energy yields of dbd fig 2b 3 2 1 2 effects of cao2 hydrolysates combined with dbd as shown in fig 5 both ca oh 2 and h2o2 released from cao2 promoted smx removal when combined with dbd the kobs of smx was in a descending order cao2 dbd 0 077 min 1 ca oh 2 dbd 0 059 min 1 h2o2 dbd 0 049 min 1 and mono dbd 0 032 min 1 fig 5b the ca oh 2 released from cao2 played a significant role in promoting dbd efficiency followed by h2o2 the ph value affects the properties of sludge as well as reactive species formation during dbd hno3 could be generated with the working gas of air acidifying the was liu et al 2019c by adding cao2 the ca oh 2 released from cao2 could neutralize the acid generated during dbd causing alkaline conditions which accelerate the decomposition of o3 and h2o2 and form more oh radicals thus achieving higher smx removal moreover the alkaline conditions caused by ca oh 2 could also promote sludge disintegration and release the adsorbed smx to the liquid phase thus improving smx removal during dbd fig 2c in addition ca2 can shield the inhibition of ions such as hco3 and co3 2 on oh and bind with the natural organic matter nom in sludge to eliminate the influences of these ions on radical capture zheng et al 2019a thus improving dbd efficiency furthermore the h2o2 released from cao2 could combine with the active particles such as o3 and nox hydrated electrons eaq and physical energies produced during dbd liu et al 2019c accelerating the production of oh and promoting smx removal 3 2 2 contributions of reactive species to smx removal in was 3 2 2 1 identification by oes and epr to further explore the removal mechanism of smx from sludge by dbd cao2 various reactive species in dbd cao2 system were detected fig 6 shows the recorded emission spectrum of the plasma plume in air over the range of 200 to 1000 nm excited atomic o 777 2 868 7 and 844 7 nm chen et al 2012 meta stable molecular o2 1 g

al 2016 and no β emissions 297 6 315 7 357 7 and 378 9 nm chen et al 2012 were detected in the plasma plume during dbd cao2 fig 6 these emission spectra indicated the existence of various ros and rns in dbd cao2 system bruggeman et al 2009 e g molecules o3 h2o2 and honoo radicals oh no2 o2 o and h ions o o2 no2 and onoo and hydrated electrons eaq due to collision between energetic electrons e and background molecules n2 o2 h2o etc as shown in eqs 1 11 wang et al 2015 1 o 2 e 2 e o o 2 o 2 e e o o 3 o 2 o o 3 4 h 2 o e oh h 5 oh oh h 2 o 2 6 ho 2 o 3 oh o 2 o 2 7 n 2 e e 2 n 8 n o no 9 no o n o 2 10 no 2 h 2 o 2 h onooh h 2 o 11 onooh oh n o 2 to further determine the main reactive radicals during dbd cao2 epr experiments were performed fig 7 a reveals the dmpo oh signal with four split lines at 1 2 2 1 of height ratio red solid diamonds indicating the existence of oh radicals in sludge during dbd cao2 treatment with sod quenching o2 reactions zhang et al 2015 fig 7b shows the signals of dmpo ooh six split lines with the same height ratio blue solid circle and dmpo oh with the addition of tba a oh quencher indicating that o2 radicals were generated in sludge during dbd cao2 the weak signal of dmpo oh in fig 7b may be the transformation of dmpo ooh zheng et al 2019a fig 7c demonstrates the appearance of a typical triplet peak of temp 1o2 1 1 1 green open pentacle sun et al 2012 indicating the generation of 1o2 in sludge during dbd cao2 in addition the triplet tempone signal from the reaction of tempone h with onoo indicates the generation of onoo during dbd cao2 with sod quenching the o2 reaction fig 5d the onoo active species have stronger reactivity than o2 radicals liu et al 2021 and are formed by reactions between no radicals produced by dbd and o2 radicals liu et al 2021 these illustrative experiments therefore confirms the existence of oh o2 1o2 and onoo in sludge during dbd cao2 treatment 3 2 2 2 identification by scavengers to find more evidence regarding the existence and contribution of various active species on smx removal from sludge a series of radical capture experiments were performed by separately adding scavengers of e oh o2 1o2 and onoo into sludge as shown in fig 8 e oh and o2 played important roles in smx removal the smx removal rates decreased with the increase of scavenger concentrations figs 8a e inhibition efficiencies were calculated to evaluate radical contributions as shown in eq 12 xiang et al 2019 12 i n inhibitio n efficiency k 0 k n k 0 100 where k0 is the rate constant in control kn is the rate constants in dbd cao2 with different radical scavengers as shown in fig 8f the kobs of smx decreased by 70 from 0 077 to 0 023 min 1 with the addition of 0 026 g g ts no3 indicating that e played a key role in smx removal from sludge the contribution of oh radical was also significant because the kobs of smx decreased by 67 from 0 077 to 0 025 min 1 with the addition of tba at 0 09 g g ts fig 8f since o2 radicals were observed by epr in was its contribution was also tested the kobs of smx decreased by 50 from 0 077 to 0 038 min 1 by adding sod 6 ku g ts fig 8f which confirmed the production of o2 radicals and their contributions to smx removal in was during dbd cao2 in addition inhibitation effects were observed with the addition of dabco and ua the kobs of smx decreased by 22 and 8 respectively figs 8d e indicating that 1o2 and onoo also contibuted to smx removal in was in general the inhibition efficiencies of various scavengers followed a sequence of no3 tba sod dabco ua fig 8f implying that the contributions of reactive species on smx removal in sludge during dbd cao2 followed the sequence of e oh o2 1o2 onoo 3 3 degradation pathways of smx in sludge during dbd cao2 the detected intermediates of smx in sludge by lc qtof are shown in fig 9 and listed in table s2 the mass spectra and chromatogram of these degradation intermediates are shown in fig s4 in total 12 transformation intermediates p 254 p 270 p 238 p 299a p 299b p 96 p 83 p 114a p 114b p 156a p 156b p 109 were identified table s2 the major transformation by products included p 238 c10h10n2o3s m h m z 238 04 p 254 c10h10n2o4s m h m z 254 04 p 156 c6h6no2s m h m z 156 01 p 109 c6h7no m h m z 109 05 and p 299 c10h9n3o6s m h m z 299 03 fig 10 the yields of the main intermediates p 238 p 254 and p 156 first increased and then decreased while the yields of p 109 and p 299 continuously increased followed by a continuous decrease in smx concentration fig 10 based on the intermediates detected and variations in their concentrations possible degradation pathways of smx in sludge during dbd cao2 were proposed as in fig 9 in summary there were four degradation pathways pathways a d for smx in was during dbd cao2 fig 9 in predominant pathway a p 238 was formed by removing the amine group from the aniline ring of smx then p 238 was further transformed into p 156a by cleavage of the c n bond in predominant pathway b p 254 stemmed from the substitution of oh to the amino group of the aniline ring of smx then p 270 c10h10n2o5s m h m z 270 03 was formed through oh attacking the benzene ring or the isoxazole ring in p 254 yan et al 2018 additionally p 254 can be transformed into 3a5mi through oh attacking the s n bond as observed previously amina et al 2020 3a5mi was subsequently converted into two isomeric intermediates p 114a and p 114b c4h6n2o2 m h m z 114 04 through oxidation of the isoxazole ring or the methyl group of 3a5mi in addition 3a5mi was converted into 3 5 dimethyloxazole p 96 c5h6no m h m z 96 04 by substitution of the methyl group to the amino group which further evolved into a smaller product called 3 methylisoxazole p 83 c4h5no m h m z 83 04 pathway c is the cleavage of the aminophenylsulfone and the methylisoxazoleamine bond of smx to form sulfanilic acid p 156b and 3a5mi p 156b was transformed into p aminothiophenol and subsequently converted into 4 aminophenol p 109 amina et al 2018 3a5mi was transformed into p 114a p 114b and p 96 as illustrated in pathway b additionally two isomeric intermediates p 299a and p 299b were also observed in our study pathway d they were formed by oxidation of the amino group in the aniline ring and hydroxylation of the aniline ring or the isoxazole ring zheng et al 2019c it is probable that the intermediates formed may be further oxidized into smaller molecules the intermediate byproducts toxicity of smx were explored via the us environmental protection agency toxicity estimation software tool t e s t based on quantitative structure activity relationships methodologies yi et al 2021 as shown in fig s5 the mutagenicity of all the intermediate byproducts was reduced into mutagenicity negative fig s5a the values of bioaccumulation factors of p 156 p 83 p 109 p 114 and p 238 were decreased compared with the original smx solution fig s5b similarly the developmental toxicity of p 83 p 114 p 96 p 109 and p 254 were decreased compared with smx fig s5c the results indicated that dbd cao2 treatment alleviated the toxicity of smx in was 3 4 sludge disintegration dewatering heavy metal removal and anaerobic fermentation performance the sem images intuitively reflected the degree of was disintegration after cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 treatments fig 11 a masses of cocci and bacilli were clustered together and embedded within the gel like extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix in raw sludge after mono cao2 the structure of flocs became loose and cracks in microbial cells fig 11a probably due to oh oxidation and alkaline hydrolysis of ca oh 2 released from cao2 after mono dbd there were obvious cracks in microbial cells and numerous clear holes fig 11a mainly due to the biocidal effect of plasma xu et al 2021 after dbd cao2 treatment the rigid gel matrix and cells showed the most serious disruption fig 11a leading to the strongest sludge disintegration effects compared with the mono dbd or mono cao2 treatments the effects of different treatments on sludge dewatering are shown in fig 11b the wc decreased from 85 raw sludge to 82 80 and 75 after cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 respectively fig 11b indicating that the performance of sludge dewatering was slightly promoted by cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 therefore dbd cao2 achieved the highest sludge dewatering efficiency moreover the sv30 value decreased from 94 raw sludge to 78 80 and 64 after cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 respectively fig 11b confirming the best sludge dewatering performance of dbd cao2 fig 11c reveals that the heavy metal contents in sludge solid phase decreased the most after dbd cao2 treatment indicating the potential of dbd cao2 to effectively remove heavy metals from sludge by solid liquid separation organic metallic complexes were formed in sludge with multivalent cations via electrostatic attraction or other interactions sheng et al 2013 during sludge disintegration by oxidation masses of entrapped or intracellular organics were released from the sludge phase into the liquid phase leading to the release of heavy metals from the solid phase into liquid phase li et al 2021a li et al 2021b notably after mono cao2 the concentration of cu in the solid phase increased fig 11c despite sludge disintegration fig 11a this phenomenon can be attributed to the precipitation of metals under the high ph caused by cao2 hydrolysis the effects of different treatments on sludge ad performance were also investigated figs 11d e the scod and vss solubilization increased significantly during ad after cao2 dbd and dbd cao2 compared to the control fig 11 d signifying the effectiveness of the three treatments in promoting sludge solubilization and reduction the scod and vss solubilization during dbd cao2 were significantly higher than those during cao2 or dbd fig 11d meaning that dbd cao2 achieved the best sludge solubilization hydrolysis and reduction performance the vfa accumulation by dbd cao2 was the highest 2537 mg cod l which was 2 2 1 4 and 1 3 times that in the control 1176 mg cod l mono cao2 1750 mg cod l and mono dbd 1788 mg cod l respectively fig 11d besides the acetate proportions in vfas increased after different treatments 32 for the control 40 for mono cao2 42 for mono dbd and 44 for dbd cao2 fig 11d several attempts have been made to enhance vfa production and the proportion of acetic acid during ad of was since vfas are high value carbon sources for biological nutrient removal in wwtps zhang et al 2021 the findings in this study show that dbd cao2 can also enhance carbon source recycling from was fig 11e reveals that dbd cao2 treatment significantly enriched the abundance of microorganisms responsible for was hydrolysis and vfa production especially the characteristic genera for acetic acid formation such as proteiniclasticum and macellibacteroides pang et al 2020 in summary dbd cao2 can not only enhance emerging contaminant removal in was but also promote sludge disintegration dewatering heavy metal removal sludge reduction sludge solubilization and acetate enriched vfa production sludge resourcization to the best of our knowledge it is for the first time that dbd cao2 is being put forward as a sludge treatment method and systematically evaluating its effects on sludge treatment 4 conclusions dbd cao2 showed significant synergistic effects for smx decomposition in sludge with a synergistic factor of 2 02 the cao2 addition significantly reduced the energy consumption of dbd compared to using mono dbd the synergistic effects of dbd cao2 were mainly attributed to base catalysis of h2o2 and o3 uv base photolysis peroxone oxidation and photocatalytic h2o2 dbd cao2 generated various ros and rns that contributed to smx removal the contributions of these reactive species followed the sequence of e oh o2 1o2 onoo based on the detected intermediates and their variations in concentration during treatment a probable degradation pathway of smx in sludge was proposed dbd cao2 not only enhanced smx attenuation in sludge but also promoted sludge disintegration dewatering heavy metal removal sludge reduction sludge solubilization and acetate enriched vfa production sludge resourcization therefore dbd cao2 could be considered as a novel efficient and eco friendly aop for sludge treatment credit authorship contribution statement

16279,the application of anaerobic digestion ad to treat waste activated sludge was still exhibits some limitations such as low methane production in this study cation exchange resin cer pretreatment was explored to enhance the efficiency of the ad of was based on the response surface methodology the optimal conditions for cer pretreatment were reaction time of 7 4 h 33 8 g cer wet weight g volatile solids and sludge total solids of 2 4 under these optimal cer pretreatment conditions approximately 30 of metals were removed from the was particularly organic binding metals this metal removal disrupted the structures of extracellular polymer substances and led to sludge deflocculation thereby releasing large amounts of organic substances from the sludge solids batch ad experiments showed that cer pretreatment increased the maximal production of volatile fatty acids and methane by 565 7 and 80 5 respectively additionally cer pretreatment promoted each stage of ad i e solubilisation hydrolysis acidification and methanation and the corresponding activities of key enzymes experimental results for semi continuous ad further confirmed that cer pretreatment enhanced the proportion of methane in the biogas from 62 75 2 14 to 73 96 0 99 and the production of methane an analysis of changes in the microbial communities demonstrated that cer pretreatment enhanced the abundance of microorganisms involved in hydrolysis acidification and acetification and changed the major methanogenic pathway from acetoclastic methanogens to methylotrophic methanogens these findings are expected to provide a reference for developing new pretreatment methods for enhancing anaerobic biodegradability of organic matters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fermentation biogas production sewage sludge enzymatic activity extracellular polymer substances 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is an effective method for treating waste activated sludge was because it reduces the final volume of sludge solids eliminates most pathogens in the sludge and produces usable biogases 55 75 vol ch4 25 45 vol co2 through the degradation of organic matter abdallah et al 2019 appels et al 2008 xu et al 2021 biomethane is a renewable energy source that can be applied in heating and electricity production thereby reducing the consumption of fossil fuels browne and murphy 2013 thus it is beneficial to convert as much organic matter into methane as possible during the ad process organic matter in was is mainly composed of extracellular polymer substances eps cellular biomass and organic substances absorbed from sewage nielsen and keiding 1998 however the semi rigid structure of sludge flocs and cell walls is an obstacle to achieving the maximum degradation of organic matter leading to low methane production appels et al 2008 khanh nguyen et al 2021 xu and dai 2020 zhen et al 2017 sludge pretreatment can effectively enhance the biodegradation of organic matter and improve ad efficiency common pretreatment methods include the application of heat acid alkaline conditions ozone enzymes ultrasound and microwaves khanh nguyen et al 2021 xu et al 2021 these methods destroy the stable structure of the sludge including the cell walls thereby releasing organic substances wrapped in eps or cells this disruption improves sludge hydrolysis and the subsequent biogas production to varying degrees appels et al 2008 khanh nguyen et al 2021 maryam et al 2021 h pang et al 2020 although these pretreatment methods are advantageous some limitations still exist that restrict their wider application ultrasound and microwave pretreatment require considerable energy acid and alkaline pretreatment and other chemical methods consume large amounts of chemical reagents which can increase treatment costs and cause secondary pollution eps not only plays an important role in maintaining the structure of sludge flocs but also protects microbial cells by enmeshing them in a three dimensional matrix within the floc d abzac et al 2010 xu et al 2017 eps mainly consists of organic substances that contain many negatively charged functional groups associated with metal binding d abzac et al 2010 the interaction between eps and metal ions strongly influences the structure of eps li and yang 2007 xu et al 2017 for instance wingender et al 1999 reported that the bonding between eps and ca2 helps retain microorganisms within the three dimensional matrix mg2 and fe3 are also integral to the stabilisation of sludge flocs nielsen and keiding 1998 zhang et al 2020 according to these studies it is reasonable that the removal of metal ions from was can disrupt the stable eps structure in the sludge floc resulting in the release of organic matter and improving the subsequent hydrolysis gopi kumar et al 2012 kun et al 2015 cation binding agents have been used to remove metal ions thereby disrupting the stable sludge floc previous studies have found that treating sludge with cation binding agents can promote sludge hydrolysis and the production of volatile fatty acids vfas kun et al 2015 wawrzynczyk et al 2008 however these studies had some limitations in that i the non recoverable complexing agents used might cause pollution when the sludge is disposed of and ii the research did not investigate the treatment mechanisms or methane production ion exchange resin is used in several industries e g water softening hydrometallurgy and chromatography because of its insolubility low cost and high recoverability alexandratos 2009 lee et al 2020 ion exchange occurs when ion exchange resin is added to a substance containing ions with the same charge alexandratos 2009 based on the properties of ion exchange cation exchange resin cer has been employed to extract eps from sludge this occurs because the cer removes metal ions from the sludge causing the disruption of the sludge floc and the release of eps frølund et al 1996 therefore it follows that cer could improve sludge hydrolysis and the release of organic substances by inducing the decomposition of sludge flocs and eps via the removal of metal ions dai et al 2015 2016 used cer to remove the bivalent and trivalent cations in the supernatant of sludge with the aim of organic solubilisation and disintegration however because the sludge is not in direct contact with the cer the cer has little damage to the sludge structure although the sludge floc is partially destroyed the structural stability of sludge organic matter is not significantly damaged resulting in no enhancement of methane production h pang et al 2020 a h 2020 b 2020 c 2021 directly mixed cer and sludge for anaerobic fermentation and proposed that the anaerobic co digestion of cer and sludge could induce the hydrolysis of sludge and then enhance the production of short chain fatty acids but they also found the presence of cer in ad was not conducive to methane production however in the previous studies on the one hand the effective contact between cer and sludge is ignored on the other hand the negative effect of cer on methanogenic fermentation is not taken into account for example in the study of h pang et al 2020 a the ion exchange reactions between metals of sludge and cer always exists in the whole fermentation process and the ion exchange reaction can be reversible therefore it is possible that the multivalent metal ions on the cer may be released into the sludge and the released metal ions may recombine with the organic matter in the sludge making the structure of sludge organic matter stable again during the whole fermentation process which is not conducive to the methanogenesis of sludge therefore the protocol of cer pretreatment for sludge needs to be improved taking into account the improvement of effective contact and the elimination of negative effects and ad of sludge with the cer pretreatment needs further systematic investigation the current study aimed to enhance methane production from sludge by applying cer pretreatment first the maximal removal of metals and corresponding dosage of cer solid content of was and time conditions were identified by response surface methodology rsm second the release of organic substances the distribution of metal ions and the sludge properties were analysed under the optimal cer pretreatment conditions third changes in sludge organic solubilisation hydrolysis acidification and methanation during ad were investigated with and without cer pretreatment and the key enzyme activities in the ad system were explored finally the enhancement of ad efficiency by applying cer pretreatment was confirmed in semi continuous ad experiments and the microbial population structure in the system was investigated the findings of this study provide a reference for developing new pretreatment methods for enhancing the anaerobic biodegradability of organic matter in was 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the was

and carbohydrate contents were monitored using the lowry method and anthrone method respectively dreywood 1946 lowry et al 1951 a gas chromatograph shimadzu gc 1020 plus japan was used to analyse the vfas content the molecular weight mw distribution of the soluble organic substances was measured using high performance size exclusion chromatography agilent 1100 usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 cer pretreatment condition optimisation using rsm the cer pretreatment conditions were optimised using rsm cer removes the metal ions in was via the ion exchange between sodium ions and metal ions thus cer dosage had effect on the content of sodium ions exchanged with metal ions in was the reaction time affects the level of ion exchange while the solid content affects the sludge rheological properties which are involved in the mass transfer rate alterations in the transfer rate may influence the efficiency of metal ion removal by cer the metal removal leads to sludge disintegration which was why metal removal was chosen as the output response to evaluate the efficiency of cer pretreatment the experimental design and corresponding results are presented in table s4 sm the analytical software suggested that the quadratic model was able to predict the output response the following final quadratic equation eq 3 was generated by the software y 214 57 11 23 x 1 9 56 x 2 395 31 x 3 0 14 x 1 x 2 10 33 x 1 x 3 0 69 x 2 x 3 3 2 77 x 1 2 0 18 x 2 2 102 39 x 3 2 where y is the metal removal mg l and x1 x2 and x3 are the coded values of reaction time cer dosage and ts content of the sludge respectively the quadratic model was further evaluated using anova table s5 sm as shown in table s5 sm the model f value of 6 92 indicates that the model was significant the value of pro f was 0 0028 and values of less than 0 05 indicate that the model terms are significant in this case x2 x3 x2 2 and x3 2 were significant terms the coefficient of variation was relatively low 12 85 which indicates that the model had good accuracy and reliability the model is considered to be applicable when the adequate precision representing the signal to noise ratio is higher than 4 therefore 9 986 of adequate precision was high enough to indicate the applicability of the regression model the actual response values were similar to the predicted values figure s2 sm which further demonstrated the applicability of the quadratic model to investigate the effects of the three factors on metal removal two dimensional contour lines and three dimensional response surfaces were generated by the software with two factors as variables and the other held constant fig 1 the constant value for each factor was the identified optimal value for that variable as shown in fig 1 a metal removal increased with increased reaction time and cer dosage up to 7 4 h and 33 8 g g vs respectively and the rate of removal decreased beyond those values the effects of ts and reaction time on metal removal fig 1 b were similar with that analysed from fig 1 a the effects of cer dosage and ts on metal removal are shown in fig 1 c metal removal reached its maximum value at a cer dosage of 33 8 g g vs and a ts content of 2 4 and then decreased as these variables were further increased the two dimensional contour lines resembled an ellipse with the long axis of the ellipse extending along the x axis reaction time or cer dosage which implied that ts had a greater influence than the reaction time or cer dosage jung et al 2011 the optimal conditions were a reaction time of 7 4 h a cer dosage of 33 8 g g vs and a ts content of 2 4 to verify the validity of the data analysis sludge was pretreated with cer under the optimal conditions the metal removal was 511 mg l which was 108 7 of the corresponding predicted value based on eq 3 3 2 characteristics of was under optimal conditions 3 2 1 changes in the distribution of the main metals table 1 lists the contents of main metals ca mg al fe cu mn zn in the cg and eg sludge samples with cer pretreatment the total metal content decreased by approximately 30 and the heavy metal content i e cu mn zn decreased by approximately 25 as shown in table 1 cer pretreatment removed 52 3 of ca and 42 9 of mg but only 10 6 of al and 13 2 of fe these results suggest that cer pretreatment was more effective in removing ca and mg this finding is similar to the results of previous studies h pang et al 2020 park and novak 2007 wu et al 2021 one possible reason for this observation is that al and fe exist in the sludge in a trivalent state which promotes their strong bonding with other substances in the sludge thereby leading to a higher stability than that of ca and mg yan et al 2015 the chemical speciation distribution of the main metals was further investigated and the results are summarised in fig 2 fig 2 a and fig 2 b show that ca and mg in the cg sludge were mainly present in the easily removed exchangeable fraction which could explain why cer pretreatment had a higher removal efficiency for ca and mg than for the other metals fig 2 c and fig 2 d show that most of al and fe 90 were in the residual fraction which is relatively stable thus leading to a low removal efficiency several studies have reported that a large amount of metal is often bound to the organic matter in sludge flocs braga et al 2017 ignatowicz 2017 shakeri yekta et al 2014 suanon et al 2016 xu et al 2017 metals bound to organic substances are called organic binding metals obms based on the study by xu et al 2017 the combined content of the exchangeable metals and organic matter binding metals was taken as the total organic binding metal content xu et al 2017 fig 2 a and fig 2 b show that the ob ca and ob mg contents decreased markedly after cer pretreatment from 12 75 mg g dry sludge ds and 4 50 mg g ds to 2 17 mg g ds and 1 53 mg g ds respectively after cer pretreatment the proportion of ob ca and ob mg decreased from 55 43 and 53 64 to 31 26 and 36 78 respectively figure s3 sm which indicates that cer pretreatment removed the obms obms reportedly play a crucial role in the stability of sludge flocs and greatly affect the physicochemical properties of sludge xu et al 2017 therefore it is reasonable that cer pretreatment significantly changed the sludge characteristics especially the characteristics of the organic substances contained in the sludge 3 2 2 organic solubilisation surface charge and structural properties of the sludge table 2 shows the characteristics of the was with and without cer pretreatment after cer pretreatment the stoc soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide contents of the sludge increased sharply from 56 15 5 37 mg l 45 00 13 14 mg l and 17 59 0 97 mg l to 858 4 59 39 mg l 1265 29 171 72 mg l and 286 21 39 01 mg l respectively these results indicate that the organic solubilisation of the sludge was enhanced by the removal of obms due to the cer pretreatment the increased stoc soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide contents also suggested that the total solids in the sludge were reduced the zeta potential can be used to reflect the surface charge property of sludge yan et al 2015 as shown in table 2 the zeta potential of the sludge floc decreased from 22 50 1 98 without pretreatment to 33 70 2 12 with cer pretreatment consequently enhancing the electronegativity on the sludge floc surface this change can be explained by the removal of obms during cer pretreatment which promotes the dissolution of negatively charged organic matter bound to metals the fractal dimension df and eps content of sludge are typically used to study the physical structure of sludge xu et al 2020 the structure of sludge becomes more compact as the df value increases li and ganczarczyk 1989 as shown in table 2 after cer pretreatment the df value of the sludge decreased from 2 02 0 01 to 1 86 0 05 which demonstrated that cer pretreatment can loosen the sludge structure one possible reason for this is that the increased surface charge table 2 might have increased the repulsion between the sludge particles resulting in a looser sludge structure eps is understood to be responsible for the sludge structure xu et al 2017 to further explore the effects of cer pretreatment on the sludge structure the eps content of the sludge was investigated as shown in fig 3 the total eps content of the eg exceeded 1300 mg toc l which was much higher than that of the cg 288 mg toc l furthermore there was a larger proportion of soluble eps in the eg owing to the cer pretreatment these results indicate that cer pretreatment made the eps more extractable implying that the stability of eps can be disrupted by cer pretreatment additionally fig 3 shows that tb eps was the predominant composition 84 73 of the total eps in the cg a similar result was found in previous studies l li et al 2018 pellicer nàcher et al 2013 which reported that a compact eps structure hindered sludge hydrolysis l li et al 2018 through cer pretreatment the proportion of tb eps sharply decreased from 84 73 to 25 44 and the proportion of lb eps increased from 2 93 to 14 39 fig 3 b these results indicate that cer pretreatment disrupted the eps thereby aiding the disintegration of the sludge structure li and yang 2007 wang et al 2021 these findings are supported by the fractal dimension results table 2 based on the above findings it can be proposed that cer pretreatment destroys the bridges between organic matter and metals by removing the metals especially obms thereby inducing eps disruption and solubilisation as well as sludge deflocculation these processes result in the release of large amounts of organic substances which could be conducive to subsequent ad 3 3 batch ad under optimal conditions 3 3 1 solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge organic matter fig 4 shows changes in the stoc soluble protein and polysaccharide concentrations throughout the 30 day ad process although the stoc concentration in eg showed a downward trend during ad it decreased significantly from 0 to 12 days but had no significant change thereafter plateauing at 178 185 mg l fig 4 a these results suggest that methane produced via the anaerobic biotransformation of stoc mainly occurred in the first 12 days which was confirmed by the ncmp results fig 7 for the cg the stoc concentration showed a relatively large fluctuation throughout the ad process the organic solubilisation occurred on days 2 and 8 which possibly led to the increased ad reaction time of the sludge fig 7 as shown in fig 4 b the overall trends of the soluble protein and polysaccharide concentrations were similar to that of stoc in both the cg and eg additionally the soluble protein concentration was significantly higher than the soluble polysaccharide concentration in the eg throughout the ad process but the concentration differences between soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide in the cg were small in section 3 2 it has been concluded that cer pretreatment mainly removed obm in sludge therefore the results indicate that obms limit the dissolution of protein probably because protein contains large amounts of carboxyl functional groups that can bond to obms hindering the release of organic matter xu et al 2020 fig 5 shows the mw distribution of soluble organic matter in the cg and eg as shown in fig 5 a from day 0 to day 6 the mw of soluble organic matter in the cg was between 50 and 200 kda in the eg as shown in fig 5 b low mw 1 kda soluble organic matter was present on day 0 accounting for 17 45 of the total content and from day 1 to day 3 the proportion of soluble organic matter between 1 and 50 kda exceeded 50 compared with the cg the eg had a greater range of soluble organic matter mw variation which suggested that cer pretreatment improved the conversion of macromolecular organic substances into small molecule substances in other words cer pretreatment enhanced the hydrolysis of organic matter 3 3 2 production and composition of volatile fatty acids the production and composition of volatile fatty acids vfas in the cg and eg sludge samples are shown in fig 6 the production of vfas was obviously higher in the eg than in the cg for example the vfas production in the eg accumulated up to 1198 76 mg cod l on day 2 which was more than six fold greater than that in the cg 180 09 mg cod l on day 1 between days 0 and 1 the vfas concentration increased by 37 70 130 78 mg cod l to 180 09 mg cod l in the cg but by 517 68 185 09 mg cod l to 1141 43 mg cod l in the eg these results indicate that cer pretreatment not only increased the vfas concentration but also enhanced the rate of vfas production in addition as shown in fig 6 acetate and propionate were the primary vfas in both the cg and eg which was consistent with other studies h pang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 regarding the vfas composition each individual vfa concentration was markedly higher in the eg than in the cg which indicates that cer pretreatment enhanced the production of individual vfa fig 6 shows that the vfas composition was more diverse in the eg than in the cg throughout the ad process especially from day 1 to day 6 the contents of isobutyrate n butyrate isovalerate and n valerate in the cg were negligible but their contents in the eg were notable for example on day 2 only acetate and propionate were detected in the cg but the isobutyrate n butyrate isovalerate and n valerate concentrations in the eg were 101 96 mg cod l 56 65 mg cod l 170 74 mg cod l and 59 32 mg cod l respectively these observations were similar to those of xu et al xu et al 2020 the increased vfas diversity could be because cer pretreatment disrupted amino acid metal complexation by removing the metals resulting in the release of amino acids that could then be degraded into different vfas via the stickland reaction thereby promoting the production of the four aforementioned organic acids in the eg batstone et al 2003 xu et al 2020 3 3 3 methane production mesophilic biochemical methane potential tests were conducted using the optimal cer pretreatment conditions the ncmp values of the eg and cg during the 22 day ad process are shown in fig 7 the maximum eg ncmp was 123 7 0 8 ml ch4 g vs which was 80 5 greater than that of the cg 66 4 7 4 ml ch4 g vs indicating that cer pretreatment significantly enhanced methane production additionally the ncmp of the eg increased from 0 to 13 days and did not change thereafter while methane production in the cg continued until day 22 suggesting that cer pretreatment improved the rate of methane production resulting in a shorter ad time two kinetic models were used to fit the ncmp data from eg and cg in order to have a better knowledge of the differences between them the main parameters of the two models are summarised in tables s6 and s7 sm the methane production potential of the eg was higher than that of the cg for both models which further confirmed that cer pretreatment enhanced the methane production potential of the sludge for the cg the determination coefficient of the pseudo first order model r2 0 9992 p 0 001 was higher than that of the modified gompertz model r2 0 9875 p 0 001 indicating that the fitting curve generated by the pseudo first order model was more suitable the pseudo first order model is generally used to describe hydrolysis as the rate limiting step kafle and chen 2016 the modified gompertz model which was usually used to describe that the growth of methanogens is limited by an inhibitory factor lay et al 1998 but it was more suitable for fitting the eg ncmp values r2 0 9947 p 0 001 than the pseudo first order model r2 0 9586 p 0 001 thus it can be inferred that cer pretreatment changed the rate limiting step from hydrolysis to the growth of methanogens fig 7 shows that the eg and cg ncmp values from days 0 to 3 were not significantly different indicating that in the first 3 days the effect of cer pretreatment on methane production was not significant one possible reason for this lack of significance is that the first 3 days constitute a lag time in the eg during which the rate of vfas production is higher than the rate of vfas consumption resulting in vfas accumulation fig 6 b this accumulation restricts the growth of methanogens and methane production xu et al 2021 after the methanogens adapted to the pretreated sludge during the lag time the vfas were rapidly degraded and the methane production sharply increased fig 7 3 3 4 activities of key enzymes in the anaerobic digestion process to corroborate the above findings the activities of protease acetate kinase hydrogenase and coenzyme f420 were measured and are shown in figure s4 sm protease and acetate kinase are involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis respectively while hydrogenase and coenzyme f420 are closely associated with methanogenesis wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 figure s4 sm shows that the activities of the four enzymes were all enhanced by cer pretreatment which further confirms that this pretreatment can enhance the hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis of sludge the enhanced hydrogenase activity implies that cer pretreatment can promote the growth of methanogens that use h2 and co2 as substrates resulting in an increased proportion of methane in the biogas which was confirmed by the subsequent semi continuous ad experiment fig 8 c 3 4 semi continuous anaerobic digestion under optimal conditions the semi continuous ad experiment was conducted to verify the results of the batch ad experiment under optimal cer pretreatment conditions the microbial population structure in the stable ad system was also analysed 3 4 1 anaerobic digestion performance the daily production values of vfas and methane in the eg and cg reactors throughout a 60 day semi continuous ad process are shown in fig 8 the predominant vfas in the two reactors are summarised in figure s5 sm as shown in fig 8 a and figure s5 in the stable stage the vfas concentration in the cg reactor was always lower than that in the eg reactor which confirms that cer pretreatment improved the hydrolysis and acidogenesis as shown in fig 8 b the daily methane production dmp was always higher in the eg than in the cg for the eg the final stable dmp was 286 20 ml d which was 52 higher than that of the cg further proving that cer pretreatment enhanced the methane production ability of the sludge fig 8 c shows that the average proportion of methane in the cg biogas was 62 75 2 14 while it was 73 96 0 99 in the eg biogas this was a 17 9 increase suggesting that cer pretreatment enhanced co2 reduction to ch4 presumably because cer pretreatment improved the hydrogenase activity figure s4 sm the results of the semi continuous ad experiment proved again that cer pretreatment enhanced the ad performance of the sludge 3 4 2 microbial community 3 4 2 1 alpha diversity analysis of the microbial community the alpha diversity of the bacterial and archaeal communities in the two reactors were investigated and are summarised in table s8 sm the ace and chao1 indexes of the bacterial and archaeal communities in the cg were both greater than those in the eg table s8 sm indicating that the bacterial and archaeal richness was reduced by cer pretreatment the shannon index of the bacteria community in the cg was higher than that in the eg and the simpson index was lower than that in the eg table s8 sm which indicates that cer pretreatment decreased the bacterial diversity in contrast a mild increase in the shannon index and a mild decrease in the simpson index of the cg archaeal community was observed which indicates that archaeal diversity was enhanced by cer pretreatment based on these results cer pretreatment decreased the bacterial diversity but increased the archaeal diversity of the sludge 3 4 2 2 bacterial community fig 9 illustrates the bacterial populations with the highest relative abundances in the two reactors at different taxonomic levels the unknown bacteria i e others are not depicted the raw data on the bacterial communities at the three taxonomic levels can be found in figure s6 sm as shown in fig 9 proteobacteria 22 38 chloroflexi 18 95 bacteroidota 12 41 acidobacteria 10 41 and actinobacteria 7 77 were the main bacterial phyla in the cg reactor and they constituted greater than 70 of the total bacterial community in the eg reactor firmicutes 23 24 bacteroidota 18 06 chloroflexi 15 37 proteobacteria 10 53 and synergistota 8 62 were predominant revealing that the structure of the bacterial community was altered by cer pretreatment these results are consistent with those of pang et al who attributed this change to a lack of metals e g ca mg in the pretreated sludge h pang et al 2020 b it has been shown that proteobacteria bacteroidota firmicutes and chloroflexi which are involved in the metabolism of organic matter e g proteins lipids cellulose sugars and amino acids are important in the hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis stages liu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 cer pretreatment led to a significant decrease in the relative abundances of the phyla chloroflexi from 18 95 to 15 37 and proteobacteria from 22 38 to 10 53 but firmicutes and bacteroidota increased sharply from 2 29 to 23 24 and from 12 41 to 18 06 respectively these results suggest that firmicutes and bacteroidota might be resilient in environments that lack multivalent metals fig 9 also shows that the total relative abundance of the four bacterial phyla in the eg was 67 20 which was higher than that in the cg 56 03 suggesting that cer pretreatment was beneficial for the enrichment of these phyla notably in the eg the proportion of synergistia of the total bacterial phyla was enhanced by approximately 84 98 compared with the cg synergistia has been reported to participate in the transfer of hydrogen between species świątczak et al 2017 thus it is reasonable to conclude that cer pretreatment led to an increase in the relative abundance of methanogens that use hydrogen as an electron donor fig 9 b presents the bacterial community at the class level gammaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria was the predominant class in the cg reactor accounting for 15 22 while bacteroidia phylum bacteroidetes 17 16 was the predominant class in the eg reactor moreover in the eg reactor the relative abundances of bacteroidia and clostridia phylum firmicutes were both significantly higher than those in the cg reactor indicating that cer pretreatment enriched these classes bacteroidia are mainly involved in acetogenesis producing vfas co2 and h2 and clostridia have strong hydrolysis ability resulting in protein degradation hao and wang 2015 świątczak et al 2017 this result indicates that cer pretreatment promotes the hydrolysis and fermentation of sludge which was supported by the results discussed in section 3 3 fig 9 c shows the differences in bacterial communities in the semi continuous ad at the genus level the most abundant bacterial genus in the cg reactor was norank f norank o aminicenantales followed by norank f norank o c10 sb1a and jgi 0 000 079 d21 in the eg the top three most abundant bacteria genera were norank f norank o izemoplasmatales norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 and norank f norank o c10 sb1a these results indicate that the structure of the bacterial genera was strongly influenced by cer pretreatment notably norank f norank o izemoplasmatales and acetoanaerobium were not present in the cg but their relative abundances in the eg were 9 52 and 4 12 respectively fig 9 c indicating their enrichment by cer pretreatment the genus norank f norank o izemoplasmatales affiliated with the order izemoplasmatales is considered to be a dna degrader zhu et al 2020 thus one possible reason for the increase in the relative abundance of norank f norank o izemoplasmatales is that cer pretreatment promotes dna release in the sludge acetoanaerobium can form acetate using co2 and h2 as substrates l li et al 2018 and the increase of its relative abundance further confirmed that cer pretreatment promoted acetogenesis in the sludge it has been reported that the genus norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 plays an important role in the degradation of complex compounds and lentimicrobium and norank f spirochaetaceae are significant producers of vfas and h2 ferguson et al 2018 he et al 2020 lefevre et al 2019 as shown in fig 9 the relative abundances of norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 lentimicrobium and norank f spirochaetaceae were clearly higher in the eg than in the cg 5 89 vs 1 49 4 26 vs 0 15 and 3 79 vs 0 34 respectively these results indicate that cer pretreatment enriched the functional bacteria that degrade complex compounds and produce vfas during ad 3 4 2 3 archaeal community fig 10 presents the archaeal community at different taxonomic levels in the two reactors halobacterota was the predominant phylum detected in both the cg and eg reactors fig 10 a the organisms in this phylum can function as hydrogenotrophic acetoclastic or methylotrophic methanogens lyu and whitman 2019 after cer pretreatment the relative abundances of halobacterota and euryarchaeota decreased from 63 88 and 33 17 in the cg to 45 73 and 10 83 in the eg but those of crenarchaeota and thermoplasmatota increased markedly from 1 82 and 0 64 in the cg to 35 33 and 7 99 in the eg respectively thermoplasmatota methanogens are methylotrophs dependant on h2 as are some of the crenarchaeota methanogens lyu and whitman 2019 therefore it was reasonable that cer pretreatment improved the abundance of methylotrophic methanogens dependant on h2 the differences in archaeal communities between the cg and eg at the class level are shown in fig 10 b the major archaeal classes detected in the cg were metahanosarcina thermococci and methanobacteria while those in the eg were metahanosarcina methanomethylicia and methanomicrobia these results indicate that both the abundances of the archaeal classes and the dominant classes were altered by cer pretreatment fig 10 c shows the differences in archaeal genera between the two reactors in the cg methanosaeta was the most abundant genus accounting for 52 78 followed by candidatus methanofastidiosum 19 33 and methanobacterium 10 29 in the eg the three most abundant archaeal genera were candidatus methanomethylicus 34 38 methanosaeta 24 69 and methanolinea 17 24 the archaeal community structure was clearly different in sludge with and without cer pretreatment one explanation for these differences could be that cer pretreatment changed the characteristics of the sludge tables 1 2 and figs 2 3 thereby affecting the ad micro environment and promoting solubilisation fig 4 hydrolysis fig 5 and acidogenesis fig 6 these alterations could have resulted in the different archaeal community structures fig 10 methanosaeta is a common acetoclastic methanogen lyu et al 2018 shamurad et al 2020 while candidatus methanomethylicus candidatus methanofastidiosum and methanomassiliicoccus are typical methylotrophic methanogens lyu et al 2018 in the eg the relative abundance of methylotrophic methanogens was 44 18 which was more than two fold greater than in the cg 20 55 indicating that cer pretreatment enhanced methylotrophic methanogenesis the identified hydrogenotrophic methanogens were methanolinea methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and methanoculleus choi et al 2018 l li et al 2018 shamurad et al 2020 traore et al 2019 the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the eg was 25 19 which was 22 46 higher than that in the cg indicating that cer pretreatment enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hydrogenotrophic methanogens reduce co2 to ch4 using h2 as an electron donor the h2 producing bacteria such as lentimicrobium and norank f spirochaetaceae were markedly enriched in the eg fig 9 c and figure s4 c sm the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens could decrease the co2 content thereby enhancing the proportion of ch4 in the biogas which is supported by the results shown in fig 8 c taken together the results indicate that cer pretreatment enhanced methane production by enriching methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in ad process of sludge 4 conclusion this study investigated the effects of cer pretreatment on the ad efficiency of sludge the optimised cer pretreatment conditions were determined using rsm and were found to be a reaction time of 7 4 h a cer dosage of 33 8 g g vs and a ts content of 2 4 cer pretreatment removed approximately 30 of the multivalent metals e g ca mg from the sludge samples especially organic binding metals this metal removal consequently led to the disruption of the eps layer and the decomposition of the sludge floc thereby releasing a large amount of organic compounds the improvement of sludge properties via cer pretreatment promoted the hydrolysis acetogenesis and methanogenesis of sludge and enhanced the activities of key enzymes protease acetate kinase hydrogenase and coenzyme f420 during ad methane production was enhanced by 80 5 and the time to reach maximum methane production was considerably shortened the ability of cer pretreatment to improve sludge ad was further confirmed by a 60 day semi continuous ad experiment cer pretreatment not only increased the methane production but also enhanced the proportion of methane in the biogas from 62 75 2 14 to 73 96 0 99 cer pretreatment changed the structure of the microbial community microbes that could carry out hydrolysis acidification and acetification were significantly enriched and the major methanogenic pathway changed from the acetoclastic methanogens to the methylotrophic methanogens in particular the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased by 22 46 as a result of the pretreatment cer pretreatment is an environmentally friendly method because cer can be recovered and recycled this study supports the advancement of low environmental risk methods for was pretreatment prior to ad declaration of

16279,the application of anaerobic digestion ad to treat waste activated sludge was still exhibits some limitations such as low methane production in this study cation exchange resin cer pretreatment was explored to enhance the efficiency of the ad of was based on the response surface methodology the optimal conditions for cer pretreatment were reaction time of 7 4 h 33 8 g cer wet weight g volatile solids and sludge total solids of 2 4 under these optimal cer pretreatment conditions approximately 30 of metals were removed from the was particularly organic binding metals this metal removal disrupted the structures of extracellular polymer substances and led to sludge deflocculation thereby releasing large amounts of organic substances from the sludge solids batch ad experiments showed that cer pretreatment increased the maximal production of volatile fatty acids and methane by 565 7 and 80 5 respectively additionally cer pretreatment promoted each stage of ad i e solubilisation hydrolysis acidification and methanation and the corresponding activities of key enzymes experimental results for semi continuous ad further confirmed that cer pretreatment enhanced the proportion of methane in the biogas from 62 75 2 14 to 73 96 0 99 and the production of methane an analysis of changes in the microbial communities demonstrated that cer pretreatment enhanced the abundance of microorganisms involved in hydrolysis acidification and acetification and changed the major methanogenic pathway from acetoclastic methanogens to methylotrophic methanogens these findings are expected to provide a reference for developing new pretreatment methods for enhancing anaerobic biodegradability of organic matters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fermentation biogas production sewage sludge enzymatic activity extracellular polymer substances 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is an effective method for treating waste activated sludge was because it reduces the final volume of sludge solids eliminates most pathogens in the sludge and produces usable biogases 55 75 vol ch4 25 45 vol co2 through the degradation of organic matter abdallah et al 2019 appels et al 2008 xu et al 2021 biomethane is a renewable energy source that can be applied in heating and electricity production thereby reducing the consumption of fossil fuels browne and murphy 2013 thus it is beneficial to convert as much organic matter into methane as possible during the ad process organic matter in was is mainly composed of extracellular polymer substances eps cellular biomass and organic substances absorbed from sewage nielsen and keiding 1998 however the semi rigid structure of sludge flocs and cell walls is an obstacle to achieving the maximum degradation of organic matter leading to low methane production appels et al 2008 khanh nguyen et al 2021 xu and dai 2020 zhen et al 2017 sludge pretreatment can effectively enhance the biodegradation of organic matter and improve ad efficiency common pretreatment methods include the application of heat acid alkaline conditions ozone enzymes ultrasound and microwaves khanh nguyen et al 2021 xu et al 2021 these methods destroy the stable structure of the sludge including the cell walls thereby releasing organic substances wrapped in eps or cells this disruption improves sludge hydrolysis and the subsequent biogas production to varying degrees appels et al 2008 khanh nguyen et al 2021 maryam et al 2021 h pang et al 2020 although these pretreatment methods are advantageous some limitations still exist that restrict their wider application ultrasound and microwave pretreatment require considerable energy acid and alkaline pretreatment and other chemical methods consume large amounts of chemical reagents which can increase treatment costs and cause secondary pollution eps not only plays an important role in maintaining the structure of sludge flocs but also protects microbial cells by enmeshing them in a three dimensional matrix within the floc d abzac et al 2010 xu et al 2017 eps mainly consists of organic substances that contain many negatively charged functional groups associated with metal binding d abzac et al 2010 the interaction between eps and metal ions strongly influences the structure of eps li and yang 2007 xu et al 2017 for instance wingender et al 1999 reported that the bonding between eps and ca2 helps retain microorganisms within the three dimensional matrix mg2 and fe3 are also integral to the stabilisation of sludge flocs nielsen and keiding 1998 zhang et al 2020 according to these studies it is reasonable that the removal of metal ions from was can disrupt the stable eps structure in the sludge floc resulting in the release of organic matter and improving the subsequent hydrolysis gopi kumar et al 2012 kun et al 2015 cation binding agents have been used to remove metal ions thereby disrupting the stable sludge floc previous studies have found that treating sludge with cation binding agents can promote sludge hydrolysis and the production of volatile fatty acids vfas kun et al 2015 wawrzynczyk et al 2008 however these studies had some limitations in that i the non recoverable complexing agents used might cause pollution when the sludge is disposed of and ii the research did not investigate the treatment mechanisms or methane production ion exchange resin is used in several industries e g water softening hydrometallurgy and chromatography because of its insolubility low cost and high recoverability alexandratos 2009 lee et al 2020 ion exchange occurs when ion exchange resin is added to a substance containing ions with the same charge alexandratos 2009 based on the properties of ion exchange cation exchange resin cer has been employed to extract eps from sludge this occurs because the cer removes metal ions from the sludge causing the disruption of the sludge floc and the release of eps frølund et al 1996 therefore it follows that cer could improve sludge hydrolysis and the release of organic substances by inducing the decomposition of sludge flocs and eps via the removal of metal ions dai et al 2015 2016 used cer to remove the bivalent and trivalent cations in the supernatant of sludge with the aim of organic solubilisation and disintegration however because the sludge is not in direct contact with the cer the cer has little damage to the sludge structure although the sludge floc is partially destroyed the structural stability of sludge organic matter is not significantly damaged resulting in no enhancement of methane production h pang et al 2020 a h 2020 b 2020 c 2021 directly mixed cer and sludge for anaerobic fermentation and proposed that the anaerobic co digestion of cer and sludge could induce the hydrolysis of sludge and then enhance the production of short chain fatty acids but they also found the presence of cer in ad was not conducive to methane production however in the previous studies on the one hand the effective contact between cer and sludge is ignored on the other hand the negative effect of cer on methanogenic fermentation is not taken into account for example in the study of h pang et al 2020 a the ion exchange reactions between metals of sludge and cer always exists in the whole fermentation process and the ion exchange reaction can be reversible therefore it is possible that the multivalent metal ions on the cer may be released into the sludge and the released metal ions may recombine with the organic matter in the sludge making the structure of sludge organic matter stable again during the whole fermentation process which is not conducive to the methanogenesis of sludge therefore the protocol of cer pretreatment for sludge needs to be improved taking into account the improvement of effective contact and the elimination of negative effects and ad of sludge with the cer pretreatment needs further systematic investigation the current study aimed to enhance methane production from sludge by applying cer pretreatment first the maximal removal of metals and corresponding dosage of cer solid content of was and time conditions were identified by response surface methodology rsm second the release of organic substances the distribution of metal ions and the sludge properties were analysed under the optimal cer pretreatment conditions third changes in sludge organic solubilisation hydrolysis acidification and methanation during ad were investigated with and without cer pretreatment and the key enzyme activities in the ad system were explored finally the enhancement of ad efficiency by applying cer pretreatment was confirmed in semi continuous ad experiments and the microbial population structure in the system was investigated the findings of this study provide a reference for developing new pretreatment methods for enhancing the anaerobic biodegradability of organic matter in was 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the was

using an automatic methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control ab sweden to monitor the methane production of the was the bmp tests were carried out in two groups a control group cg and an experiment group eg the substrate in the cg was sludge that was stirred without cer treatment while the eg substrate was cer pretreated sludge the inoculum substrate i s ratio in each group was 1 2

analytical methods tessier et al tessier et al 1979 reported that the five fractions of metals present in sludge are as follows exchangeable exc bound to carbonates car bound to iron and manganese oxides fe mnox bound to organic matter omb and residual res the chemical speciation of the four main metals ca mg al and fe was determined via the modified tessier method according to xu et al xu et

by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy agilent 5100 soluble eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted from the sludge samples using a modified heating extraction method li and yang 2007 as described in text s3 sm sludge samples at 2 3 10 and 30 days in the batch ad experiment were collected to measure the protease acetate kinase coenzyme f420 and hydrogenase activities the protease and acetate kinase activities were determined by the method of li et al using azocasein and potassium acetate as the substrate respectively l li et al 2018 the activity of hydrogenase was quantified by the amount of hydrogen released from the reduction of methyl viologen by sodium dithionite based on the method of wang et al 2018 coenzyme f420 activity was analysed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry referring to the study of wang et al 2018 the detailed measurement procedures about the four enzymes are available in text s4 sm the ts vs ph and concentrations of the main metals in the sludge were measured using standard methods apha 2006 the zeta potential of the sludge was measured by a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk the fractal dimension

vfas content the molecular weight mw distribution of the soluble organic substances was measured using high performance size exclusion chromatography agilent 1100 usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 cer pretreatment condition optimisation using rsm the cer pretreatment conditions were optimised using rsm cer removes the metal ions in was via the ion exchange between sodium ions and metal ions thus cer dosage had effect on the content of sodium ions exchanged with metal ions in was the reaction time affects the level of ion exchange while the solid content affects the sludge rheological properties which are involved in the mass transfer rate alterations in the transfer rate may influence the efficiency of metal ion removal by cer the metal removal leads to sludge disintegration which was why metal removal was chosen as the output response to evaluate the efficiency of cer pretreatment the experimental design and corresponding results are presented in table s4 sm the analytical software suggested that the quadratic model was able to predict the output response the following final quadratic equation eq 3 was generated by the software y 214 57 11 23 x 1 9 56 x 2 395 31 x 3 0 14 x 1 x 2 10 33 x 1 x 3 0 69 x 2 x 3 3 2 77 x 1 2 0 18 x 2 2 102 39 x 3 2 where y is the metal removal mg l and x1 x2 and x3 are the coded values of reaction time cer dosage and ts content of the sludge respectively the quadratic model was further evaluated using anova table s5 sm as shown in table s5 sm the model f value of 6 92 indicates that the model was significant the value of pro f was 0 0028 and values of less than 0 05 indicate that the model terms are significant in this case x2 x3 x2 2 and x3 2 were significant terms the coefficient of variation was relatively low 12 85 which indicates that the model had good accuracy and reliability the model is considered to be applicable when the adequate precision representing the signal to noise ratio is higher than 4 therefore 9 986 of adequate precision was high enough to indicate the applicability of the regression model the actual response values were similar to the predicted values figure s2 sm which further demonstrated the applicability of the quadratic model to investigate the effects of the three factors on metal removal two dimensional contour lines and three dimensional response surfaces were generated by the software with two factors as variables and the other held constant fig 1 the constant value for each factor was the identified optimal value for that variable as shown in fig 1 a metal removal increased with increased reaction time and cer dosage up to 7 4 h and 33 8 g g vs respectively and the rate of removal decreased beyond those values the effects of ts and reaction time on metal removal fig 1 b were similar with that analysed from fig 1 a the effects of cer dosage and ts on metal removal are shown in fig 1 c metal removal reached its maximum value at a cer dosage of 33 8 g g vs and a ts content of 2 4 and then decreased as these variables were further increased the two dimensional contour lines resembled an ellipse with the long axis of the ellipse extending along the x axis reaction time or cer dosage which implied that ts had a greater influence than the reaction time or cer dosage jung et al 2011 the optimal conditions were a reaction time of 7 4 h a cer dosage of 33 8 g g vs and a ts content of 2 4 to verify the validity of the data analysis sludge was pretreated with cer under the optimal conditions the metal removal was 511 mg l which was 108 7 of the corresponding predicted value based on eq 3 3 2 characteristics of was under optimal conditions 3 2 1 changes in the distribution of the main metals table 1 lists the contents of main metals ca mg al fe cu mn zn in the cg and eg sludge samples with cer pretreatment the total metal content decreased by approximately 30 and the heavy metal content i e cu mn zn decreased by approximately 25 as shown in table 1 cer pretreatment removed 52 3 of ca and 42 9 of mg but only 10 6 of al and 13 2 of fe these results suggest that cer pretreatment was more effective in removing ca and mg this finding is similar to the results of previous studies h pang et al 2020 park and novak 2007 wu et al 2021 one possible reason for this observation is that al and fe exist in the sludge in a trivalent state which promotes their strong bonding with other substances in the sludge thereby leading to a higher stability than that of ca and mg yan et al 2015 the chemical speciation distribution of the main metals was further investigated and the results are summarised in fig 2 fig 2 a and fig 2 b show that ca and mg in the cg sludge were mainly present in the easily removed exchangeable fraction which could explain why cer pretreatment had a higher removal efficiency for ca and mg than for the other metals fig 2 c and fig 2 d show that most of al and fe 90 were in the residual fraction which is relatively stable thus leading to a low removal efficiency several studies have reported that a large amount of metal is often bound to the organic matter in sludge flocs braga et al 2017 ignatowicz 2017 shakeri yekta et al 2014 suanon et al 2016 xu et al 2017 metals bound to organic substances are called organic binding metals obms based on the study by xu et al 2017 the combined content of the exchangeable metals and organic matter binding metals was taken as the total organic binding metal content xu et al 2017 fig 2 a and fig 2 b show that the ob ca and ob mg contents decreased markedly after cer pretreatment from 12 75 mg g dry sludge ds and 4 50 mg g ds to 2 17 mg g ds and 1 53 mg g ds respectively after cer pretreatment the proportion of ob ca and ob mg decreased from 55 43 and 53 64 to 31 26 and 36 78 respectively figure s3 sm which indicates that cer pretreatment removed the obms obms reportedly play a crucial role in the stability of sludge flocs and greatly affect the physicochemical properties of sludge xu et al 2017 therefore it is reasonable that cer pretreatment significantly changed the sludge characteristics especially the characteristics of the organic substances contained in the sludge 3 2 2 organic solubilisation surface charge and structural properties of the sludge table 2 shows the characteristics of the was with and without cer pretreatment after cer pretreatment the stoc soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide contents of the sludge increased sharply from 56 15 5 37 mg l 45 00 13 14 mg l and 17 59 0 97 mg l to 858 4 59 39 mg l 1265 29 171 72 mg l and 286 21 39 01 mg l respectively these results indicate that the organic solubilisation of the sludge was enhanced by the removal of obms due to the cer pretreatment the increased stoc soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide contents also suggested that the total solids in the sludge were reduced the zeta potential can be used to reflect the surface charge property of sludge yan et al 2015 as shown in table 2 the zeta potential of the sludge floc decreased from 22 50 1 98 without pretreatment to 33 70 2 12 with cer pretreatment consequently enhancing the electronegativity on the sludge floc surface this change can be explained by the removal of obms during cer pretreatment which promotes the dissolution of negatively charged organic matter bound to metals the fractal dimension df and eps content of sludge are typically used to study the physical structure of sludge xu et al 2020 the structure of sludge becomes more compact as the df value increases li and ganczarczyk 1989 as shown in table 2 after cer pretreatment the df value of the sludge decreased from 2 02 0 01 to 1 86 0 05 which demonstrated that cer pretreatment can loosen the sludge structure one possible reason for this is that the increased surface charge table 2 might have increased the repulsion between the sludge particles resulting in a looser sludge structure eps is understood to be responsible for the sludge structure xu et al 2017 to further explore the effects of cer pretreatment on the sludge structure the eps content of the sludge was investigated as shown in fig 3 the total eps content of the eg exceeded 1300 mg toc l which was much higher than that of the cg 288 mg toc l furthermore there was a larger proportion of soluble eps in the eg owing to the cer pretreatment these results indicate that cer pretreatment made the eps more extractable implying that the stability of eps can be disrupted by cer pretreatment additionally fig 3 shows that tb eps was the predominant composition 84 73 of the total eps in the cg a similar result was found in previous studies l li et al 2018 pellicer nàcher et al 2013 which reported that a compact eps structure hindered sludge hydrolysis l li et al 2018 through cer pretreatment the proportion of tb eps sharply decreased from 84 73 to 25 44 and the proportion of lb eps increased from 2 93 to 14 39 fig 3 b these results indicate that cer pretreatment disrupted the eps thereby aiding the disintegration of the sludge structure li and yang 2007 wang et al 2021 these findings are supported by the fractal dimension results table 2 based on the above findings it can be proposed that cer pretreatment destroys the bridges between organic matter and metals by removing the metals especially obms thereby inducing eps disruption and solubilisation as well as sludge deflocculation these processes result in the release of large amounts of organic substances which could be conducive to subsequent ad 3 3 batch ad under optimal conditions 3 3 1 solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge organic matter fig 4 shows changes in the stoc soluble protein and polysaccharide concentrations throughout the 30 day ad process although the stoc concentration in eg showed a downward trend during ad it decreased significantly from 0 to 12 days but had no significant change thereafter plateauing at 178 185 mg l fig 4 a these results suggest that methane produced via the anaerobic biotransformation of stoc mainly occurred in the first 12 days which was confirmed by the ncmp results fig 7 for the cg the stoc concentration showed a relatively large fluctuation throughout the ad process the organic solubilisation occurred on days 2 and 8 which possibly led to the increased ad reaction time of the sludge fig 7 as shown in fig 4 b the overall trends of the soluble protein and polysaccharide concentrations were similar to that of stoc in both the cg and eg additionally the soluble protein concentration was significantly higher than the soluble polysaccharide concentration in the eg throughout the ad process but the concentration differences between soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide in the cg were small in section 3 2 it has been concluded that cer pretreatment mainly removed obm in sludge therefore the results indicate that obms limit the dissolution of protein probably because protein contains large amounts of carboxyl functional groups that can bond to obms hindering the release of organic matter xu et al 2020 fig 5 shows the mw distribution of soluble organic matter in the cg and eg as shown in fig 5 a from day 0 to day 6 the mw of soluble organic matter in the cg was between 50 and 200 kda in the eg as shown in fig 5 b low mw 1 kda soluble organic matter was present on day 0 accounting for 17 45 of the total content and from day 1 to day 3 the proportion of soluble organic matter between 1 and 50 kda exceeded 50 compared with the cg the eg had a greater range of soluble organic matter mw variation which suggested that cer pretreatment improved the conversion of macromolecular organic substances into small molecule substances in other words cer pretreatment enhanced the hydrolysis of organic matter 3 3 2 production and composition of volatile fatty acids the production and composition of volatile fatty acids vfas in the cg and eg sludge samples are shown in fig 6 the production of vfas was obviously higher in the eg than in the cg for example the vfas production in the eg accumulated up to 1198 76 mg cod l on day 2 which was more than six fold greater than that in the cg 180 09 mg cod l on day 1 between days 0 and 1 the vfas concentration increased by 37 70 130 78 mg cod l to 180 09 mg cod l in the cg but by 517 68 185 09 mg cod l to 1141 43 mg cod l in the eg these results indicate that cer pretreatment not only increased the vfas concentration but also enhanced the rate of vfas production in addition as shown in fig 6 acetate and propionate were the primary vfas in both the cg and eg which was consistent with other studies h pang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 regarding the vfas composition each individual vfa concentration was markedly higher in the eg than in the cg which indicates that cer pretreatment enhanced the production of individual vfa fig 6 shows that the vfas composition was more diverse in the eg than in the cg throughout the ad process especially from day 1 to day 6 the contents of isobutyrate n butyrate isovalerate and n valerate in the cg were negligible but their contents in the eg were notable for example on day 2 only acetate and propionate were detected in the cg but the isobutyrate n butyrate isovalerate and n valerate concentrations in the eg were 101 96 mg cod l 56 65 mg cod l 170 74 mg cod l and 59 32 mg cod l respectively these observations were similar to those of xu et al xu et al 2020 the increased vfas diversity could be because cer pretreatment disrupted amino acid metal complexation by removing the metals resulting in the release of amino acids that could then be degraded into different vfas via the stickland reaction thereby promoting the production of the four aforementioned organic acids in the eg batstone et al 2003 xu et al 2020 3 3 3 methane production mesophilic biochemical methane potential tests were conducted using the optimal cer pretreatment conditions the ncmp values of the eg and cg during the 22 day ad process are shown in fig 7 the maximum eg ncmp was 123 7 0 8 ml ch4 g vs which was 80 5 greater than that of the cg 66 4 7 4 ml ch4 g vs indicating that cer pretreatment significantly enhanced methane production additionally the ncmp of the eg increased from 0 to 13 days and did not change thereafter while methane production in the cg continued until day 22 suggesting that cer pretreatment improved the rate of methane production resulting in a shorter ad time two kinetic models were used to fit the ncmp data from eg and cg in order to have a better knowledge of the differences between them the main parameters of the two models are summarised in tables s6 and s7 sm the methane production potential of the eg was higher than that of the cg for both models which further confirmed that cer pretreatment enhanced the methane production potential of the sludge for the cg the determination coefficient of the pseudo first order model r2 0 9992 p 0 001 was higher than that of the modified gompertz model r2 0 9875 p 0 001 indicating that the fitting curve generated by the pseudo first order model was more suitable the pseudo first order model is generally used to describe hydrolysis as the rate limiting step kafle and chen 2016 the modified gompertz model which was usually used to describe that the growth of methanogens is limited by an inhibitory factor lay et al 1998 but it was more suitable for fitting the eg ncmp values r2 0 9947 p 0 001 than the pseudo first order model r2 0 9586 p 0 001 thus it can be inferred that cer pretreatment changed the rate limiting step from hydrolysis to the growth of methanogens fig 7 shows that the eg and cg ncmp values from days 0 to 3 were not significantly different indicating that in the first 3 days the effect of cer pretreatment on methane production was not significant one possible reason for this lack of significance is that the first 3 days constitute a lag time in the eg during which the rate of vfas production is higher than the rate of vfas consumption resulting in vfas accumulation fig 6 b this accumulation restricts the growth of methanogens and methane production xu et al 2021 after the methanogens adapted to the pretreated sludge during the lag time the vfas were rapidly degraded and the methane production sharply increased fig 7 3 3 4 activities of key enzymes in the anaerobic digestion process to corroborate the above findings the activities of protease acetate kinase hydrogenase and coenzyme f420 were measured and are shown in figure s4 sm protease and acetate kinase are involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis respectively while hydrogenase and coenzyme f420 are closely associated with methanogenesis wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 figure s4 sm shows that the activities of the four enzymes were all enhanced by cer pretreatment which further confirms that this pretreatment can enhance the hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis of sludge the enhanced hydrogenase activity implies that cer pretreatment can promote the growth of methanogens that use h2 and co2 as substrates resulting in an increased proportion of methane in the biogas which was confirmed by the subsequent semi continuous ad experiment fig 8 c 3 4 semi continuous anaerobic digestion under optimal conditions the semi continuous ad experiment was conducted to verify the results of the batch ad experiment under optimal cer pretreatment conditions the microbial population structure in the stable ad system was also analysed 3 4 1 anaerobic digestion performance the daily production values of vfas and methane in the eg and cg reactors throughout a 60 day semi continuous ad process are shown in fig 8 the predominant vfas in the two reactors are summarised in figure s5 sm as shown in fig 8 a and figure s5 in the stable stage the vfas concentration in the cg reactor was always lower than that in the eg reactor which confirms that cer pretreatment improved the hydrolysis and acidogenesis as shown in fig 8 b the daily methane production dmp was always higher in the eg than in the cg for the eg the final stable dmp was 286 20 ml d which was 52 higher than that of the cg further proving that cer pretreatment enhanced the methane production ability of the sludge fig 8 c shows that the average proportion of methane in the cg biogas was 62 75 2 14 while it was 73 96 0 99 in the eg biogas this was a 17 9 increase suggesting that cer pretreatment enhanced co2 reduction to ch4 presumably because cer pretreatment improved the hydrogenase activity figure s4 sm the results of the semi continuous ad experiment proved again that cer pretreatment enhanced the ad performance of the sludge 3 4 2 microbial community 3 4 2 1 alpha diversity analysis of the microbial community the alpha diversity of the bacterial and archaeal communities in the two reactors were investigated and are summarised in table s8 sm the ace and chao1 indexes of the bacterial and archaeal communities in the cg were both greater than those in the eg table s8 sm indicating that the bacterial and archaeal richness was reduced by cer pretreatment the shannon index of the bacteria community in the cg was higher than that in the eg and the simpson index was lower than that in the eg table s8 sm which indicates that cer pretreatment decreased the bacterial diversity in contrast a mild increase in the shannon index and a mild decrease in the simpson index of the cg archaeal community was observed which indicates that archaeal diversity was enhanced by cer pretreatment based on these results cer pretreatment decreased the bacterial diversity but increased the archaeal diversity of the sludge 3 4 2 2 bacterial community fig 9 illustrates the bacterial populations with the highest relative abundances in the two reactors at different taxonomic levels the unknown bacteria i e others are not depicted the raw data on the bacterial communities at the three taxonomic levels can be found in figure s6 sm as shown in fig 9 proteobacteria 22 38 chloroflexi 18 95 bacteroidota 12 41 acidobacteria 10 41 and actinobacteria 7 77 were the main bacterial phyla in the cg reactor and they constituted greater than 70 of the total bacterial community in the eg reactor firmicutes 23 24 bacteroidota 18 06 chloroflexi 15 37 proteobacteria 10 53 and synergistota 8 62 were predominant revealing that the structure of the bacterial community was altered by cer pretreatment these results are consistent with those of pang et al who attributed this change to a lack of metals e g ca mg in the pretreated sludge h pang et al 2020 b it has been shown that proteobacteria bacteroidota firmicutes and chloroflexi which are involved in the metabolism of organic matter e g proteins lipids cellulose sugars and amino acids are important in the hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis stages liu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 cer pretreatment led to a significant decrease in the relative abundances of the phyla chloroflexi from 18 95 to 15 37 and proteobacteria from 22 38 to 10 53 but firmicutes and bacteroidota increased sharply from 2 29 to 23 24 and from 12 41 to 18 06 respectively these results suggest that firmicutes and bacteroidota might be resilient in environments that lack multivalent metals fig 9 also shows that the total relative abundance of the four bacterial phyla in the eg was 67 20 which was higher than that in the cg 56 03 suggesting that cer pretreatment was beneficial for the enrichment of these phyla notably in the eg the proportion of synergistia of the total bacterial phyla was enhanced by approximately 84 98 compared with the cg synergistia has been reported to participate in the transfer of hydrogen between species świątczak et al 2017 thus it is reasonable to conclude that cer pretreatment led to an increase in the relative abundance of methanogens that use hydrogen as an electron donor fig 9 b presents the bacterial community at the class level gammaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria was the predominant class in the cg reactor accounting for 15 22 while bacteroidia phylum bacteroidetes 17 16 was the predominant class in the eg reactor moreover in the eg reactor the relative abundances of bacteroidia and clostridia phylum firmicutes were both significantly higher than those in the cg reactor indicating that cer pretreatment enriched these classes bacteroidia are mainly involved in acetogenesis producing vfas co2 and h2 and clostridia have strong hydrolysis ability resulting in protein degradation hao and wang 2015 świątczak et al 2017 this result indicates that cer pretreatment promotes the hydrolysis and fermentation of sludge which was supported by the results discussed in section 3 3 fig 9 c shows the differences in bacterial communities in the semi continuous ad at the genus level the most abundant bacterial genus in the cg reactor was norank f norank o aminicenantales followed by norank f norank o c10 sb1a and jgi 0 000 079 d21 in the eg the top three most abundant bacteria genera were norank f norank o izemoplasmatales norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 and norank f norank o c10 sb1a these results indicate that the structure of the bacterial genera was strongly influenced by cer pretreatment notably norank f norank o izemoplasmatales and acetoanaerobium were not present in the cg but their relative abundances in the eg were 9 52 and 4 12 respectively fig 9 c indicating their enrichment by cer pretreatment the genus norank f norank o izemoplasmatales affiliated with the order izemoplasmatales is considered to be a dna degrader zhu et al 2020 thus one possible reason for the increase in the relative abundance of norank f norank o izemoplasmatales is that cer pretreatment promotes dna release in the sludge acetoanaerobium can form acetate using co2 and h2 as substrates l li et al 2018 and the increase of its relative abundance further confirmed that cer pretreatment promoted acetogenesis in the sludge it has been reported that the genus norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 plays an important role in the degradation of complex compounds and lentimicrobium and norank f spirochaetaceae are significant producers of vfas and h2 ferguson et al 2018 he et al 2020 lefevre et al 2019 as shown in fig 9 the relative abundances of norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 lentimicrobium and norank f spirochaetaceae were clearly higher in the eg than in the cg 5 89 vs 1 49 4 26 vs 0 15 and 3 79 vs 0 34 respectively these results indicate that cer pretreatment enriched the functional bacteria that degrade complex compounds and produce vfas during ad 3 4 2 3 archaeal community fig 10 presents the archaeal community at different taxonomic levels in the two reactors halobacterota was the predominant phylum detected in both the cg and eg reactors fig 10 a the organisms in this phylum can function as hydrogenotrophic acetoclastic or methylotrophic methanogens lyu and whitman 2019 after cer pretreatment the relative abundances of halobacterota and euryarchaeota decreased from 63 88 and 33 17 in the cg to 45 73 and 10 83 in the eg but those of crenarchaeota and thermoplasmatota increased markedly from 1 82 and 0 64 in the cg to 35 33 and 7 99 in the eg respectively thermoplasmatota methanogens are methylotrophs dependant on h2 as are some of the crenarchaeota methanogens lyu and whitman 2019 therefore it was reasonable that cer pretreatment improved the abundance of methylotrophic methanogens dependant on h2 the differences in archaeal communities between the cg and eg at the class level are shown in fig 10 b the major archaeal classes detected in the cg were metahanosarcina thermococci and methanobacteria while those in the eg were metahanosarcina methanomethylicia and methanomicrobia these results indicate that both the abundances of the archaeal classes and the dominant classes were altered by cer pretreatment fig 10 c shows the differences in archaeal genera between the two reactors in the cg methanosaeta was the most abundant genus accounting for 52 78 followed by candidatus methanofastidiosum 19 33 and methanobacterium 10 29 in the eg the three most abundant archaeal genera were candidatus methanomethylicus 34 38 methanosaeta 24 69 and methanolinea 17 24 the archaeal community structure was clearly different in sludge with and without cer pretreatment one explanation for these differences could be that cer pretreatment changed the characteristics of the sludge tables 1 2 and figs 2 3 thereby affecting the ad micro environment and promoting solubilisation fig 4 hydrolysis fig 5 and acidogenesis fig 6 these alterations could have resulted in the different archaeal community structures fig 10 methanosaeta is a common acetoclastic methanogen lyu et al 2018 shamurad et al 2020 while candidatus methanomethylicus candidatus methanofastidiosum and methanomassiliicoccus are typical methylotrophic methanogens lyu et al 2018 in the eg the relative abundance of methylotrophic methanogens was 44 18 which was more than two fold greater than in the cg 20 55 indicating that cer pretreatment enhanced methylotrophic methanogenesis the identified hydrogenotrophic methanogens were methanolinea methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and methanoculleus choi et al 2018 l li et al 2018 shamurad et al 2020 traore et al 2019 the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the eg was 25 19 which was 22 46 higher than that in the cg indicating that cer pretreatment enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hydrogenotrophic methanogens reduce co2 to ch4 using h2 as an electron donor the h2 producing bacteria such as lentimicrobium and norank f spirochaetaceae were markedly enriched in the eg fig 9 c and figure s4 c sm the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens could decrease the co2 content thereby enhancing the proportion of ch4 in the biogas which is supported by the results shown in fig 8 c taken together the results indicate that cer pretreatment enhanced methane production by enriching methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in ad process of sludge 4 conclusion this study investigated the effects of cer pretreatment on the ad efficiency of sludge the optimised cer pretreatment conditions were determined using rsm and were found to be a reaction time of 7 4 h a cer dosage of 33 8 g g vs and a ts content of 2 4 cer pretreatment removed approximately 30 of the multivalent metals e g ca mg from the sludge samples especially organic binding metals this metal removal consequently led to the disruption of the eps layer and the decomposition of the sludge floc thereby releasing a large amount of organic compounds the improvement of sludge properties via cer pretreatment promoted the hydrolysis acetogenesis and methanogenesis of sludge and enhanced the activities of key enzymes protease acetate kinase hydrogenase and coenzyme f420 during ad methane production was enhanced by 80 5 and the time to reach maximum methane production was considerably shortened the ability of cer pretreatment to improve sludge ad was further confirmed by a 60 day semi continuous ad experiment cer pretreatment not only increased the methane production but also enhanced the proportion of methane in the biogas from 62 75 2 14 to 73 96 0 99 cer pretreatment changed the structure of the microbial community microbes that could carry out hydrolysis acidification and acetification were significantly enriched and the major methanogenic pathway changed from the acetoclastic methanogens to the methylotrophic methanogens in particular the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased by 22 46 as a result of the pretreatment cer pretreatment is an environmentally friendly method because cer can be recovered and recycled this study supports the advancement of low environmental risk methods for was pretreatment prior to ad declaration of
