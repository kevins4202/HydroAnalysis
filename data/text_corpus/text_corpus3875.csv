19375,biocides are inter alia applied as preservatives on facades to prevent the growth of microorganisms their incomplete mineralization results in new compounds so called transformation products tps rain causes that both applied biocides and their tps leach from facades with stormwater into the urban aquatic environment this study is the first to investigate the introduction of the biocides diuron terbutryn and octylisothiazolinone oit and their tps into the groundwater via urban stormwater infiltration systems in this study the tps of these biocides were created by laboratory photolysis and elucidated using lc hrms the results were then used to analyze tps by lc ms ms in stormwater and groundwater samples which were taken from an urban swale trench system and from groundwater wells upgradient and downgradient of the infiltration system a sprinkling experiment was conducted to evaluate facades as a contamination source biodegradation tests were conducted to determine bio persistence of biocides and their tps fourteen tps were identified under laboratory photolysis tp 186 tp 210 and tp 256 of terbutryn were hitherto unknown nine tps were qualitatively detected in environmental water samples parent compounds tp 219 of diuron and tp 212 tp 214 and tp 226 of terbutryn were detected at a maximum concentration of 140 ng l 1 during stormwater events concentrations in groundwater were considerably below german drinking water limits but were higher in groundwater samples downgradient from the investigated swale trench system than in those collected upgradient neither the biocides nor most of their tps were readily biodegradable under simulated surface water conditions the results show that entry of biocides and their tps into groundwater is caused by infiltration of urban stormwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords leaching facade coatings qualitative tp screening stormwater events groundwater contamination 1 introduction biocides are commonly applied to external thermal insulation composite systems of buildings to prevent the growth of microorganisms such as algae fungi and bacteria they are inter alia added to water based polymer resin paints and renders stormwater events cause leaching of biocides from facades and entry into urban aquatic environment where they pose a risk to human and environment due to their toxic potential burkhardt et al 2009 the leaching processes of biocides from facade coatings by stormwater sw have been analyzed in a variety of studies for example the influence of external factors e g architecture weather exposure and climate conditions or physicochemical properties of substances e g water solubility and octanol water partition coefficient were examined breuer et al 2012 burkhardt et al 2012 jungnickel et al 2008 schoknecht et al 2009 for most substances leaching is non continuous and takes place at the beginning of a rain event first flush effect the amount of biocides on facades declines with the age of facades and is particularly high early in the lifetimes of coatings burkhardt et al 2012 various biocides have been detected in sw of urban areas burkhardt et al 2011 gasperi et al 2014 in these areas large fractions of sw from facades drain on paved surfaces and reach combined or separated sewer systems in combined sewer systems contaminants are discharged via wastewater treatment plants whereas in separated sewer systems they are dissipated into rivers or infiltration systems bollmann et al 2014a 2014b during the entire lifetime of biocides transformation processes influence the fate of biocides e g hydrolysis biodegradation and direct and indirect photolysis fenner et al 2013 in most cases incomplete degradation of organic chemicals leads to the formation of tps whose molecular structure physicochemical properties toxicity and environmental behavior is often unknown tps and their parent compounds differ regarding their persistence and toxic potential gutowski et al 2015 herrmann et al 2015 khaleel et al 2017 menz et al 2017 it is also known that tps of several biocides are formed directly on facades by photolysis bollmann et al 2016 2017b tps are not only little understood but also difficult to purchase and targeted synthesis is expensive and time consuming hence analytical data on the molecular structures and behavior are missing alternatively solutions received from photolysis can be used to provide further information on chromatographic and mass spectrometric parameters that allow for an analysis of environmental samples ibánez et al 2004 this qualitative target screening can be ranked between commonly applied suspected target screening and quantitative target screening methods hernández et al 2005 krauss et al 2010 moreover this procedure has been used to verify already known or to identify hitherto unknown tps herrmann et al 2016 because they are commonly used in facade paints burkhardt et al 2009 bollmann et al 2017a this study focuses on the biocides diuron 3 3 4 dichlorophenyl 1 1 dimethylurea terbutryn 2 n tert butyl 4 n ethyl 6 methylsulfanyl 1 3 5 triazine 2 4 diamine and oit 2 octyl 1 2 thiazol 3 one and their related tps main focus of this study was on the pathway identification of these substances into groundwater via infiltration systems in a first step photodegradation experiments were performed to establish the molecular structure of tps by means of lc hrms due to its high resolution and mass accuracy results of the photodegradation experiments were used to optimize ms parameters in lc ms ms e g mass transitions and quantifier qualifier ratio for a sensitive and selective target screening of tps in stormwater and groundwater samples samples were taken from an urban district with a separated sewer system and a connected swale trench system for sw infiltration finally a sprinkling experiment was conducted on a 14 year old facade in the contributing catchment to identify potential sources of biocide residues in the investigated swale trench system closed bottle test cbt was used to assess the ready biodegradability of parent compounds and their tps 2 methods 2 1 laboratory experiments and analytical methods 2 1 1 chemicals and reagents analytical standards of diuron 99 6 terbutryn 99 1 oit 99 1 terbumeton 99 2 and 2 hydroxy terbutylazin 97 3 were purchased from sigma aldrich chemie gmbh steinheim germany diuron desmethyl 97 5 terbutryn desethyl 99 8 and internal standards terbutryn d5 98 5 and diuron d6 99 0 already dissolved in acetonitrile 100 μg ml

degradation experiments an initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 of test substances diuron terbutryn and oit were used to create and subsequently identify tps an additional experiment was conducted twice c 100 ng l 1 to determine the quantum yield φ of parent compounds photolysis was conducted with an initial volume of 800 ml using a xenon arc lamp txe 150 peschl ultraviolet mainz germany which closely matches the solar radiation yager and yue 1988 it was equipped with an ilmasil quartz immersion tube in a cylindrical batch reactor t 20 2 c photolysis experiments were performed over a time period of 8 0 h with hourly sampling 1 ml the absolute photon flux and the quantum yield were determined as described in supplementary material sm 1 as mass balances are known bollmann et al 2016 2017b this study focused on the analysis of hitherto unknown tps and production of solutions with tps to receive analytical data for ms ms to analyze the pathway of the substances into groundwater 2 1 3 biodegradation testing closed bottle test a closed bottle test cbt was performed in accordance with the oecd guideline 301d using low concentration of minerals and inoculums to evaluate whether a substance is readily biodegradable in infiltrated water and aquatic environments a substance is classified as readily biodegradable if the measured biochemical oxygen demand bod reaches at least 60 of the theoretical oxygen demand thod oecd 1992 within a 10 day window 1 l of mineral medium was inoculated with two drops of sewage treatment plant effluent approx 500 cfu ml 1 inoculum was received from the municipal sewage treatment plant of lüneburg 144 000 population equivalents the test was conducted in the dark for 28 days at t 20 1 c the initial concentration of diuron terbutryn and oit was 4 mg l 1 3 mg l 1 and 2 2 mg l 1 respectively corresponding to a thod of 5 mg l 1 which is most suitable for the cbt sm 8 that was done for the parent compounds and the photolytic mixture in a same manner samples taken at the beginning and the end of the cbt underwent lc ms analysis the basic experimental setups and validity criteria are described in detail elsewhere herrmann et al 2015

3 is located in a residential district that was developed on a former military base the residential area was established between 1997 and 2004 in total 153 500 m2 of urban area are drained by a separate infiltration system where excess sw from roofs roads and public places is collected via open gutters and pipes in swales 25 swales are allocated in two linear cascades which extend over the full length of the study site fig 1 each swale has an underground percolation trench and consists of 0 5 m organic rich topsoil with grass vegetation located on top of a 0 2 m layer of fine sand to avoid groundwater contamination by infiltrating sw in accordance with the german technical guideline a 138 german association for water wastewater and waste dwa 2005 trenches consist of a 0 7 m gravel layer partly substituted by plastic blocks rigofill inspect to increase porosity during rain events sw pools in swales infiltrates via the soil sand layer and is temporarily stored in the trenches before it percolates towards groundwater two swale trench systems were chosen for sampling fig 1 the aquifer underneath the study site consists of alluvial fan deposits of up to 11 m depth underlain by an impermeable bottom layer the groundwater is shallow with mean water tables close to the bottom level of the trenches seven groundwater wells are spatially distributed over the entire study site whereby three of them are located in the upgradient ug 1 3 and four in the downgradient dg 1 4 of the swale trench systems in total an urban catchment of 2 95 ha subcatchment 1 is connected to swale s1 and trench t1 a part consists of a public commercial area where runoff from facades can reach the storm drainage through arcade like walls overhanging the pervious pavement of sidewalks and open areas but also pavements touching the basement of buildings facades of the residential part can be considered as primarily disconnected from the sw drainage due to gravel filled rims along the basement often combined with adjacent grassy or horticultural areas that do not generate runoff sm 4 subcatchment 2 8047 m2 is an entirely private residential area with facade runoff mostly disconnected from sw drainage analogous to the residential part of subcatchment 1 the corresponding swale s2 and trench t2 receive sw from subcatchment 2 but also excess sw from s1 for more information see jackisch and weiler 2015 2 3 sampling pooled runoff swale water and infiltrated trench water were collected during three sw events table 1 in addition four groundwater samplings were conducted that were independent from stormwater events a sprinkling experiment was implemented to evaluate facades as a contamination source of biocides from facade runoff into s1 during a heavy rain event the resulting facades runoff and the runoff draining and pooling in the swale were sampled further information on the characteristics and conditions of the sampling site is listed in sm 4 2 3 1 event sampling during each sw event one sample per event was collected via grab sampling from water pooling in the swale trench water was extracted right below the sw sampling points using a peristaltic pump and a teflon tube to include quick preferential infiltration one trench sample was taken with a minimum delay of 15 min to swale sampling a probe continuously measuring water levels and electrical conductivity was installed inside t1 to verify that freshly infiltrated sw was captured sm 5 for each sample a water volume of three liters was collected and transferred into two 1 l brown glass bottles with teflon sealing bottles were stored under cool t 4 c and dark conditions and sent in a cooled package for analysis within 24 h t1 was usually empty at the onset of rain events while t2 was often partly filled possibly due to a high groundwater level hence data on t1 allowed for a better interpretation of biocide retention in the swale trench system 2 3 2 groundwater sampling to ensure that samples represent the same groundwater layer wells were chosen from a large pool of monitoring wells based on similarity in electrical conductivity oxygen an cations and stable oxygen isotopes concentrations for each sampled well two liters were extracted twice using a submersible pump stainless steel and teflon tubes following the general guidelines on representative groundwater sampling iso 5667 11 groundwater sampling was carried out as part of a regular monitoring campaign that takes place twice a year once in early spring i e after the main groundwater recharge period for the study area and once in autumn i e after the dry summer period usually accompanied by numerous intense storms 2 3 3 facade sprinkling experiment a sprinkling experiment was carried out on a 14 year old red painted facade within subcatchment 1 fig 1 location f the objective of this experiment was to verify the release and transport pathway of biocides and tps from a facade into the infiltration system and to a lesser extent to reproduce leaching under realistic precipitation conditions hence our experiment should be regarded as a worst case scenario since pressure amount and ph of the applied water did not correspond to a natural rainfall the facade still appeared very bright and clean after 14 years of exposure using tap water from a nearby hydrant and a water hose sm 3 figs 2 18 000 l were applied within two hours at a constant rate 150 l min 1 four samples from each sampling point i e direct facade runoff draining runoff and pooling runoff in the s1 were taken at different time points over a course of two hours table 1 in addition a blank sample was taken directly from the water hose t1 stayed dry during the experiment which prevented sampling of the trench water 2 4 preparation and measurement of environmental samples diuron terbutryn oit and tps were analyzed in a total number of 55 samples in duplicates using triple quadrupole agilent technologies 1200 infinity lc system and 6430 triple quad waldbronn germany further information on sample preparation and instrumental analysis can be found in the sm 2 after qualitative detection of tp 219 of diuron and tp 212 tp 214 and tp 226 of terbutryn in environmental samples analytical reference standards of diuron desmethyl tp 219 2 hydroxy terbutylazin tp 212 terbutryn desethyl tp 214 and terbumeton tp 226 were used for a second analysis of samples that showed quantifiable peak areas of these tps 3 results and discussion 3 1 photolysis of diuron terbutryn and oit calculated quantum yields of ϕ 0 005 7 diuron ϕ 0 006 9 terbutryn and ϕ 0 012 16 oit varied slightly compared to previous studies where quantum yields were higher by a factor 4 diuron and 8 terbutryn canle et al 2005 jirkovský et al 1997 although quantum yields observed here and in other studies are very low and the overlap of absorption spectra of substances sm 1 with the emission spectrum of the sunlight 290 nm is small these substances might undergo direct photolytic degradation processes in the environment with a low probability however formation of tps on facades by photolysis was demonstrated by some studies but they also showed that tps formed by biodegradation and photodegradation are similar bollmann et al 2016 2017a 2017b tixier et al 2001 thereby tps that might probably be formed by biodegradation in other compartments of this study area e g soil phases were included in environmental analyses it is been found by photolysis dark experiments and in additional laboratory experiments according to oecd 111 that analyzed biocides are hydrolytically stable over a long time period under given analytical conditions e g ionization and chromatography lc ms non target screening indicated the presence of at least 7 tps related to terbutryn 3 to diuron and 2 to oit structures of four out of fourteen tps were validated by an analytical standard table 2 photolysis of diuron led to dehalogenation and subsequent hydroxylation of the phenyl group tp 215a and tp 215b and demethylation of dimethylurea group tp 219 this is a result that is in line with other studies jirkovský et al 1997 tanaka et al 1986 tixier et al 2001 as e g bollmann et al 2016 stated photolysis of terbutryn results in the substitution of the methylthio group by hydrogen tp 168 tp 196 hydroxy tp 212 and ether tp 226 tp 168 and tp 214 developed through the loss of the ethyl group tp 258 was formed by oxidation of the methylthio group resulting in methylsulfoxide group for terbutryn two newly identified tp with m z of 210 and 256 were tentatively elucidated suggesting that tp 210 emerged from replacement of the methylthio group by oxygen and photocyclisation of the ethyl group forming imidazole tp 256 was probably formed by ketonization of the ethyl group and tp 186 by separation of tert butyl group this assumption was confirmed to some extent by the observed fragmentation patterns and the exact masses sm 7 tp 214 is also a metabolite m1 of the biocide irgarol and could also be formed by its degradation okamura 2000 tp 212 also known as 2 hydroxyterbutylazin was previously analyzed as tp of the plant protection agent terbutylazin as one of the most frequently detected tps in surface water and groundwater reemtsma et al 2013 photolysis of oit led to the formation of tp 214 by photoisomerization and tp 130 through breakage of the thiazole ring as it has been elucidated by bollmann et al 2017b this study observed that those tps are formed on facades although they found a higher number of tps than it was here one possible explanation might be that this study used a different irradiation source i e uv radiation which implies higher power and a broader wavelength overlap of emission and absorption spectrum 3 2 aerobic biodegradation testing concerning the biodegradation test all validity criteria of the oecd guideline were fulfilled results of the investigated cbt for the parent compounds showed no biodegradation regarding thod and still 0 after 28 days in cbt for diuron terbutryn and oit therefore all three substances can be classified as not readily biodegradable substances according to the test guideline a result that is confirmed by primary elimination rates as found by lc ms the recovery of diuron terbutryn and oit after 28 days was 85 1 7 102 2 8 and 90 0 3 respectively based on lc ms analysis the biodegradation of photolysis mixtures taken after 8 h of irradiation showed a slight increase of elimination of 15 photolysis mixture of diuron 25 photolysis mixture of terbutryn and 30 photolysis mixture of oit this indicates the possibility of biodegradation for some photo tps in biodegradation tests the samples taken at the beginning and end of each cbt were analyzed by lc ms most of the detected tps showed a recovery of approximately 102 11 after 28 days whereas other tps were further biodegraded tp 130 of oit and tp 215 a and tp 215 b of diuron showed a recovery of 0 5 8 0 2 and 16 2 2 respectively results received here are not directly comparable with results from literature due to the usage of differing groups of microorganisms and test conditions in this study we analyzed ready biodegradability under conditions which matches those of surface water high persistence of terbutryn and diuron and high degradation rates of isothiazolinones were observed in case of using soil microorganisms over a test period of 120 days by bollmann et al 2017a tixier et al 2000 2001 observed fungal degradation of diuron bollmann et al 2017a also stated lower persistence of tps of oit than tps of terbutryn as it was found here no further tps were found to be formed by biodegradation of photo tps except for the tps that show high rates of degradation the biocides and tps examined here are likely to persist in the aquatic environment for this reason it might be possible to detect them in environmental samples 3 3 occurrence of biocides and their tps in stormwater and groundwater replicates of all analyzed environmental samples showed errors of 16 2 diuron 13 7 terbutryn and 16 8 oit on average indicating that the method applied here was very precise the presence of nine tps in environmental samples could be shown by qualitative target screening with parameters received from photolysis experiments qualitative data was confirmed for tp 212 tp 214 and tp 226 of terbutryn and tp 219 of diuron by repeating the measurements with available reference standards thereby actual concentrations were determined for four out of 14 tps furthermore this re analysis of samples allowed for a confirmation of qualitative results of the previous analyses analyses of the water samples showed that all three biocides could be detected in all sampling types swale trench and groundwater table 3 apart from tp 215 a and tp 215 b of diuron tp 130 of oit and tp 186 and tp 258 of terbutryn all tps could be detected in at least 5 of analyzed samples tps that were persistent in previously described biodegradation tests were found in environmental samples the general low recovery of tps of oit is in line with studies showing that tps tend to remain on facades bollmann et al 2017b and degrade rapidly in soil bollmann et al 2017a tp 226 of terbutryn is usually linked to the plant protection agent terbumeton bollmann et al 2016 but since its use was banned in germany the present results can be explained by the transformation of terbutryn tp 219 of diuron was the most common one in 69 of samples terbutryn detected in 81 of all stormwater samples and its tp 212 75 and tp 214 69 were predominantly found in stormwater samples and diuron 100 and its tp 219 82 in groundwater samples oit occurred infrequently in all sampling types this is in accordance with bollmann et al 2017a 2017b who observed high degradation rates of oit in soil and high retention on facades therefore higher detection frequency of oit in swale water and lower one in trench water and groundwater might be explained by high persistence in surface water chapter 3 2 but low lifetimes in soil phases bollmann et al 2017a 3 3 1 transport of biocides and tps during sw runoff events quantified concentration levels of biocides and their tps in sw runoff fig 2 were in accordance with findings in urban catchments in denmark and switzerland bollmann et al 2014a burkhardt et al 2011 diuron was only detectable in s1 after sw runoff event 1 c 4 9 ng l 1 but in t1 at event 2 which suggests other sources than the infiltrating water from s1 or rather a continuous release from the soil phase its tp 219 was detectable in s1 during event 2 c 2 3 ng l 1 and in the underlying trench in similar concentrations fig 3 most previous studies focused on tp 219 of diuron as a plant protection agent in agriculture field et al 1997 gatidou et al 2004 reemtsma et al 2013 wittmer et al 2010 only a few studies have investigated the occurrence of tp 219 of diuron in urban runoff so far reemtsma et al 2013 wittmer et al 2010 if it was detected at all concentration levels were comparable with those found in this study terbutryn was found in all samples taken from s1 and s2 in a range of 1 160 ng l 1 fig 2 concentrations of terbutryn in s2 cmax s2 6 4 ng l 1 were much lower than in s1 cmax s1 160 ng l 1 which indicates that the concentration in the urban sw strongly depends on the amount of facades and especially their type and age connected to the infiltration system in this case subcatchment 2 was smaller than 1 seven s1 and five s2 terbutryn tps were detected in swale samples both tp 256 and tp 214 occurred frequently in runoff water this result is very much in line with bollmann et al 2016 who showed that of the terbutryn tps leaching from facades tp 214 was the most important one in our study the maximum concentration was 72 8 ng l 1 tp 214 was also present at 2 3 ng l 1 in trench water a result that might be due to retention by the soil layer during the infiltration process however application of its additional parent compound irgarol in the study site cannot be ruled out therefore measured concentrations might not be a result of terbutryn alone tp 212 was present up to 23 2 ng l 1 in swale samples and up to 11 ng l 1 in trench samples it was also detected in urban runoff water in similar concentrations by reemtsma et al 2013 however these authors did not link this tp to terbutryn as its parent compound but to terbutylazin instead tp 226 was not detected in runoff samples this is in accordance with literature which suggest that this is one of the terbutryn tps that tends to remain on facades bollmann et al 2016 here maximum concentrations of tp 226 were detected in trench water 15 9 ng l 1 because the concentrations in trench water were higher than in swale water this tp probably occurred by biodegradation of adsorbed terbutryn on soil bollmann et al 2017a that might had entered by earlier stormwater events therefore it is impossible to trace their environmental fate as precisely as the other tps in general number and concentration of the majority of detected tps decreased in the trench compared to swale water it may thus be concluded that a part was retained in the soil layer without a complete elimination from the water phase oit was only quantifiable in s1 but for all three events in concentrations between 2 5 and 66 8 ng l 1 however oit was not detected in the underlying t1 a result that might be due to retention in the soil layer and more likely its rapid degradation in soil as it has been shown by bollmann et al 2017a the decreasing concentration of biocides during sw events may be caused by the intra event variability of biocide concentrations since the low temporal resolution of two replicates per event is insufficient to display first flush effects olsson et al 2013 3 3 2 infiltration of biocides and tps into groundwater in this study biocides and some tps were detected in infiltrated groundwater of an urban area for the first time other studies focused on groundwater affected by the use of plant protection agents in agriculture and related tps field et al 1997 gooddy et al 2002 quednow and püttmann 2007 reemtsma et al 2013 one study analyzed infiltrated groundwater of a separated sewer system but could not detect biocides bollmann et al 2014b the comparison of mean concentrations of downgradient dg 8 8 ng l 1 groundwater samples of the swale trench system to upgradient ug ones c1 1 ng l 1 showed an increase in the mean concentration of diuron by a factor of 8 fig 4 concentrations of tp 219 were up to cmax 7 3 ng l 1 increasing concentrations in dg samples factor of 3 7 were found for this compound as well due to its presence in s1 and t1 it might have entered groundwater via the swale trench system observed concentrations in groundwater were higher compared to those in stormwater there seemed to be continuous release from the soil phase due to the relatively high adsorption affinity of diuron compared to terbutryn which could be indicated by the retention times terbutryn diuron as a rough approximation additionally for tp 219 it is possible that it was formed by microorganisms in the soil layer terbutryn was only detected in dg samples at maximum concentrations cmax of 7 6 ng l 1 except the three ug samples taken during event 1 and 4 tp 214 of terbutryn was also only detected in dg at cmax 3 3 ng l 1 except two samples in ug this indicates that terbutryn and its tp 214 most likely entered the groundwater via the swale trench system in contrast to the trends observed for terbutryn and diuron concentrations of oit remained unchanged it was detected rather infrequently at the whole study site and only during the second and fourth sampling event cmax 1 4 ng l 1 the low presence of oit and its tps in groundwater samples and the fact that they were not found in trench samples may be an indication for high soil degradation rates as it was stated before bollmann et al 2017a in summary the number of biocides and their tps were higher in the groundwater downgradient 49 of the swale trench system than upgradient 27 the increase of concentrations of diuron terbutryn and their tps in downgradient samples strongly suggests groundwater contamination by the swale trench system however since some of these substances were also detectable in upgradient samples other potential pathways into groundwater need to be considered such as rapid infiltration through gravel filled rims at the basement of facades and diffuse infiltration through grassed and permeable pavements 3 3 3 assessment of biocide transport from facade to sw infiltration by sprinkling experiments during the artificial sprinkling experiment fig 5 diuron leached from the facade with maximum concentrations of 17 7 ng l 1 and was also found in draining and pooling runoffs in s1 cmax 7 7 ng l 1 tp 219 leached from the facade in thirtyfold higher concentrations cmax 691 8 ng l 1 and was also detected in pooling runoff with cmax 378 2 ng l 1 for diuron sprinkling runoff concentrations were similar to those in sw runoff this was however not the case for tp 219 burkhardt et al 2012 found conversely a low recovery of tp 219 on an artificial wall under natural conditions and assumed further degradation processes the duration of exposure and facade material e g pigment color urbanczyk et al 2017 seem to influence the transformation of diuron to tp 219 terbutryn leached from the facade in low concentrations of 0 4 ng l 1 but was detected in higher concentrations in the s1 up to cmax 1 9 ng l 1 oit was only detected in two samples of facade runoff but not in draining or pooling runoff samples not one of its tps was detected given these results it is possible that terbutryn and oit and their tps might have leached from other facades of the contributing drainage areas since both were detected in the swale during sw events the results of the sprinkling experiment suggest that biocidal residues are released from facades and then transported to the swale trench system as discussed in the introduction even a fourteen year old facade still releases biocidal residues higher concentrations of the parent compound can be expected in runoff from newer facades burkhardt et al 2012 the in situ development of tps on facades described in other studies was confirmed here bollmann et al 2016 2017b 4 conclusion this study analyzed the leaching of biocides and their tps from facades during stormwater events into groundwater we combined qualitative target screening with data provided by laboratory photolysis and confirmed the results using reference standards if they were available using this approach we identified three new tps of terbutryn and overall nine different tps in stormwater and groundwater samples this study extends the knowledge on the transport pathways of biocides and their tps in urban stormwater and groundwater facades were confirmed as biocide sources releasing contaminants over their entire life span the comparison of two subcatchments suggests that the mobilized contaminant concentrations strongly depend on study site characteristics such as different facade types and their connection to the stormwater drainage system since groundwater concentrations increased in downgradient groundwater we hypothesize that biocidal groundwater contamination is caused by the investigated infiltration system acknowledgements the

19375,biocides are inter alia applied as preservatives on facades to prevent the growth of microorganisms their incomplete mineralization results in new compounds so called transformation products tps rain causes that both applied biocides and their tps leach from facades with stormwater into the urban aquatic environment this study is the first to investigate the introduction of the biocides diuron terbutryn and octylisothiazolinone oit and their tps into the groundwater via urban stormwater infiltration systems in this study the tps of these biocides were created by laboratory photolysis and elucidated using lc hrms the results were then used to analyze tps by lc ms ms in stormwater and groundwater samples which were taken from an urban swale trench system and from groundwater wells upgradient and downgradient of the infiltration system a sprinkling experiment was conducted to evaluate facades as a contamination source biodegradation tests were conducted to determine bio persistence of biocides and their tps fourteen tps were identified under laboratory photolysis tp 186 tp 210 and tp 256 of terbutryn were hitherto unknown nine tps were qualitatively detected in environmental water samples parent compounds tp 219 of diuron and tp 212 tp 214 and tp 226 of terbutryn were detected at a maximum concentration of 140 ng l 1 during stormwater events concentrations in groundwater were considerably below german drinking water limits but were higher in groundwater samples downgradient from the investigated swale trench system than in those collected upgradient neither the biocides nor most of their tps were readily biodegradable under simulated surface water conditions the results show that entry of biocides and their tps into groundwater is caused by infiltration of urban stormwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords leaching facade coatings qualitative tp screening stormwater events groundwater contamination 1 introduction biocides are commonly applied to external thermal insulation composite systems of buildings to prevent the growth of microorganisms such as algae fungi and bacteria they are inter alia added to water based polymer resin paints and renders stormwater events cause leaching of biocides from facades and entry into urban aquatic environment where they pose a risk to human and environment due to their toxic potential burkhardt et al 2009 the leaching processes of biocides from facade coatings by stormwater sw have been analyzed in a variety of studies for example the influence of external factors e g architecture weather exposure and climate conditions or physicochemical properties of substances e g water solubility and octanol water partition coefficient were examined breuer et al 2012 burkhardt et al 2012 jungnickel et al 2008 schoknecht et al 2009 for most substances leaching is non continuous and takes place at the beginning of a rain event first flush effect the amount of biocides on facades declines with the age of facades and is particularly high early in the lifetimes of coatings burkhardt et al 2012 various biocides have been detected in sw of urban areas burkhardt et al 2011 gasperi et al 2014 in these areas large fractions of sw from facades drain on paved surfaces and reach combined or separated sewer systems in combined sewer systems contaminants are discharged via wastewater treatment plants whereas in separated sewer systems they are dissipated into rivers or infiltration systems bollmann et al 2014a 2014b during the entire lifetime of biocides transformation processes influence the fate of biocides e g hydrolysis biodegradation and direct and indirect photolysis fenner et al 2013 in most cases incomplete degradation of organic chemicals leads to the formation of tps whose molecular structure physicochemical properties toxicity and environmental behavior is often unknown tps and their parent compounds differ regarding their persistence and toxic potential gutowski et al 2015 herrmann et al 2015 khaleel et al 2017 menz et al 2017 it is also known that tps of several biocides are formed directly on facades by photolysis bollmann et al 2016 2017b tps are not only little understood but also difficult to purchase and targeted synthesis is expensive and time consuming hence analytical data on the molecular structures and behavior are missing alternatively solutions received from photolysis can be used to provide further information on chromatographic and mass spectrometric parameters that allow for an analysis of environmental samples ibánez et al 2004 this qualitative target screening can be ranked between commonly applied suspected target screening and quantitative target screening methods hernández et al 2005 krauss et al 2010 moreover this procedure has been used to verify already known or to identify hitherto unknown tps herrmann et al 2016 because they are commonly used in facade paints burkhardt et al 2009 bollmann et al 2017a this study focuses on the biocides diuron 3 3 4 dichlorophenyl 1 1 dimethylurea terbutryn 2 n tert butyl 4 n ethyl 6 methylsulfanyl 1 3 5 triazine 2 4 diamine and oit 2 octyl 1 2 thiazol 3 one and their related tps main focus of this study was on the pathway identification of these substances into groundwater via infiltration systems in a first step photodegradation experiments were performed to establish the molecular structure of tps by means of lc hrms due to its high resolution and mass accuracy results of the photodegradation experiments were used to optimize ms parameters in lc ms ms e g mass transitions and quantifier qualifier ratio for a sensitive and selective target screening of tps in stormwater and groundwater samples samples were taken from an urban district with a separated sewer system and a connected swale trench system for sw infiltration finally a sprinkling experiment was conducted on a 14 year old facade in the contributing catchment to identify potential sources of biocide residues in the investigated swale trench system closed bottle test cbt was used to assess the ready biodegradability of parent compounds and their tps 2 methods 2 1 laboratory experiments and analytical methods 2 1 1 chemicals and reagents analytical standards of diuron 99 6 terbutryn 99 1 oit 99 1 terbumeton 99 2 and 2 hydroxy terbutylazin 97 3 were purchased from sigma aldrich chemie gmbh steinheim germany diuron desmethyl 97 5 terbutryn desethyl 99 8 and internal standards terbutryn d5 98 5 and diuron d6 99 0 already dissolved in acetonitrile 100 μg ml

degradation experiments an initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 of test substances diuron terbutryn and oit were used to create and subsequently identify tps an additional experiment was conducted twice

2017b this study focused on the analysis of hitherto unknown tps and production of solutions with tps to receive analytical data for ms ms to analyze the pathway of the substances into groundwater 2 1 3 biodegradation testing closed bottle test a closed bottle test cbt was performed in accordance with the oecd guideline 301d using low concentration of minerals and inoculums to evaluate whether a substance is readily biodegradable in infiltrated water and aquatic environments a substance is classified as readily biodegradable if the measured biochemical oxygen demand bod reaches at least 60 of the theoretical oxygen demand thod oecd 1992 within a 10 day window 1 l of mineral medium was inoculated with two drops of sewage treatment plant effluent approx 500 cfu ml 1 inoculum was received from the municipal sewage treatment plant of lüneburg 144 000 population equivalents the test was conducted in the dark for 28 days at t 20 1 c the initial concentration of diuron terbutryn and oit was 4 mg l 1 3 mg l 1 and 2 2 mg l 1 respectively corresponding to a thod of 5 mg l 1 which is most suitable for the cbt sm 8 that was done for the parent compounds and the photolytic mixture in a same manner samples taken at the beginning and the end of the cbt underwent lc ms analysis the basic experimental setups and validity criteria are described in detail elsewhere herrmann et al 2015

3 is located in a residential district that was developed on a former military base the residential area was established between 1997 and 2004 in total 153 500 m2 of urban area are drained by a separate infiltration system where excess sw from roofs roads and public places is collected via open gutters and pipes in swales 25 swales are allocated in two linear cascades which extend over the full length of the study site fig 1 each swale has an underground percolation trench and consists of 0 5 m organic rich topsoil with grass vegetation located on top of a 0 2 m layer of fine sand to avoid groundwater contamination by infiltrating sw in accordance with the german technical guideline a 138 german association for water wastewater and waste dwa 2005 trenches consist of a 0 7 m gravel layer partly substituted by plastic blocks rigofill inspect to increase porosity during rain events sw pools in swales infiltrates via the soil sand layer and is temporarily stored in the trenches before it percolates towards groundwater two swale trench systems were chosen for sampling fig 1 the aquifer underneath the study site consists of alluvial fan deposits of up to 11 m depth underlain by an impermeable bottom layer the groundwater is shallow with mean water tables close to the bottom level of the trenches seven groundwater wells are spatially distributed over the entire study site whereby three of them are located in the upgradient ug 1 3 and four in the downgradient dg 1 4 of the swale trench systems in total an urban catchment of 2 95 ha subcatchment 1 is connected to swale s1 and trench t1 a part consists of a public commercial area where runoff from facades can reach the storm drainage through arcade like walls overhanging the pervious pavement of sidewalks and open areas but also pavements touching the basement of buildings facades of the residential part can be considered as primarily disconnected from the sw drainage due to gravel filled rims along the basement often combined with adjacent grassy or horticultural areas that do not generate runoff sm 4 subcatchment 2 8047 m2 is an entirely private residential area with facade runoff mostly disconnected from sw drainage analogous to the residential part of subcatchment 1 the corresponding swale s2 and trench t2 receive sw from subcatchment 2 but also excess sw from s1 for more information see jackisch and weiler 2015 2 3 sampling pooled runoff swale water and infiltrated trench water were collected during three sw events table 1 in addition four groundwater samplings were conducted that were independent from stormwater events a sprinkling experiment was implemented to evaluate facades as a contamination source of biocides from facade runoff into s1 during a heavy rain event the resulting facades runoff and the runoff draining and pooling in the swale were sampled further information on the characteristics and conditions of the sampling site is listed in sm 4 2 3 1 event sampling during each sw event one sample per event was collected via grab sampling from water pooling in the swale trench water was extracted right below the sw sampling points using a peristaltic pump and a teflon tube to include quick preferential infiltration one trench sample was taken with a minimum delay of 15 min to swale sampling a probe continuously measuring water levels and electrical conductivity was installed inside t1 to verify that freshly infiltrated sw was captured sm 5 for each sample a water volume of three liters was collected and transferred into two 1 l brown glass bottles with teflon sealing bottles were stored under cool t 4 c and dark conditions and sent in a cooled package for analysis within 24 h t1 was usually empty at the onset of rain events while t2 was often partly filled possibly due to a high groundwater level hence data on t1 allowed for a better interpretation of biocide retention in the swale trench system 2 3 2 groundwater sampling to ensure that samples represent the same groundwater layer wells were chosen from a large pool of monitoring wells based on similarity in electrical conductivity oxygen an cations and stable oxygen isotopes concentrations for each sampled well two liters were extracted twice using a submersible pump stainless steel and teflon tubes following the general guidelines on representative groundwater sampling iso 5667 11 groundwater sampling was carried out as part of a regular monitoring campaign that takes place twice a year once in early spring i e after the main groundwater recharge period for the study area and once in autumn i e after the dry summer period usually accompanied by numerous intense storms 2 3 3 facade sprinkling experiment a sprinkling experiment was carried out on a 14 year old red painted facade within subcatchment 1 fig 1 location f the objective of this experiment was to verify the release and transport pathway of biocides and tps from a facade into the infiltration system and to a lesser extent to reproduce leaching under realistic precipitation conditions hence our experiment should be regarded as a worst case scenario since pressure amount and ph of the applied water did not correspond to a natural rainfall the facade still appeared very bright and clean after 14 years of exposure using tap water from a nearby hydrant and a water hose sm 3 figs 2 18 000 l were applied within two hours at a constant rate 150 l min 1 four samples from each sampling point i e direct facade runoff draining runoff and pooling runoff in the s1 were taken at different time points over a course of two hours table 1 in addition a blank sample was taken directly from the water hose t1 stayed dry during the experiment which prevented sampling of the trench water 2 4 preparation and measurement of environmental samples diuron terbutryn oit and tps were analyzed in a total number of 55 samples in duplicates using triple quadrupole agilent technologies 1200 infinity lc system and 6430 triple quad waldbronn germany further information on sample preparation and instrumental analysis can be found in the sm 2 after qualitative detection of tp 219 of diuron and tp 212 tp 214 and tp 226 of terbutryn in environmental samples analytical reference standards of diuron desmethyl tp 219 2 hydroxy terbutylazin tp 212 terbutryn desethyl tp 214 and terbumeton tp 226 were used for a second analysis of samples that showed quantifiable peak areas of these tps 3 results and discussion 3 1 photolysis of diuron terbutryn and oit calculated quantum yields of ϕ 0 005 7 diuron ϕ 0 006 9 terbutryn and ϕ 0 012 16 oit varied slightly compared to previous studies where quantum yields were higher by a factor 4 diuron and 8 terbutryn canle et al 2005 jirkovský et al 1997 although quantum yields observed here and in other studies are very low and the overlap of absorption spectra of substances sm 1 with the emission spectrum of the sunlight 290 nm is small these substances might undergo direct photolytic degradation processes in the environment with a low probability however formation of tps on facades by photolysis was demonstrated by some studies but they also showed that tps formed by biodegradation and photodegradation are similar bollmann et al 2016 2017a 2017b tixier et al 2001 thereby tps that might probably be formed by biodegradation in other compartments of this study area e g soil phases were included in environmental analyses it is been found by photolysis dark experiments and in additional laboratory experiments according to oecd 111 that analyzed biocides are hydrolytically stable over a long time period under given analytical conditions e g ionization and chromatography lc ms non target screening indicated the presence of at least 7 tps related to terbutryn 3 to diuron and 2 to oit structures of four out of fourteen tps were validated by an analytical standard table 2 photolysis of diuron led to dehalogenation and subsequent hydroxylation of the phenyl group tp 215a and tp 215b and demethylation of dimethylurea group tp 219 this is a result that is in line with other studies jirkovský et al 1997 tanaka et al 1986 tixier et al 2001 as e g bollmann et al 2016 stated photolysis of terbutryn results in the substitution of the methylthio group by hydrogen tp 168 tp 196 hydroxy tp 212 and ether tp 226 tp 168 and tp 214 developed through the loss of the ethyl group tp 258 was formed by oxidation of the methylthio group resulting in methylsulfoxide group for terbutryn two newly identified tp with m z of 210 and 256 were tentatively elucidated suggesting that tp 210 emerged from replacement of the methylthio group by oxygen and photocyclisation of the ethyl group forming imidazole tp 256 was probably formed by ketonization of the ethyl group and tp 186 by separation of tert butyl group this assumption was confirmed to some extent by the observed fragmentation patterns and the exact masses sm 7 tp 214 is also a metabolite m1 of the biocide irgarol and could also be formed by its degradation okamura 2000 tp 212 also known as 2 hydroxyterbutylazin was previously analyzed as tp of the plant protection agent terbutylazin as one of the most frequently detected tps in surface water and groundwater reemtsma et al 2013 photolysis of oit led to the formation of tp 214 by photoisomerization and tp 130 through breakage of the thiazole ring as it has been elucidated by bollmann et al 2017b this study observed that those tps are formed on facades although they found a higher number of tps than it was here one possible explanation might be that this study used a different irradiation source i e uv radiation which implies higher power and a broader wavelength overlap of emission and absorption spectrum 3 2 aerobic biodegradation testing concerning the biodegradation test all validity criteria of the oecd guideline were fulfilled results of the investigated cbt for the parent compounds showed no biodegradation regarding thod and still 0 after 28 days in cbt for diuron terbutryn and oit therefore all three substances can be classified as not readily biodegradable substances according to the test guideline a result that is confirmed by primary elimination rates as found by lc ms the recovery of diuron terbutryn and oit after 28 days was 85 1 7 102 2 8 and 90 0 3 respectively based on lc ms analysis the biodegradation of photolysis mixtures taken after 8 h of irradiation showed a slight increase of elimination of 15 photolysis mixture of diuron 25 photolysis mixture of terbutryn and 30 photolysis mixture of oit this indicates the possibility of biodegradation for some photo tps in biodegradation tests the samples taken at the beginning and end of each cbt were analyzed by lc ms most of the detected tps showed a recovery of approximately 102 11 after 28 days whereas other tps were further biodegraded tp 130 of oit and tp 215 a and tp 215 b of diuron showed a recovery of 0 5 8 0 2 and 16 2 2 respectively results received here are not directly comparable with results from literature due to the usage of differing groups of microorganisms and test conditions in this study we analyzed ready biodegradability under conditions which matches those of surface water high persistence of terbutryn and diuron and high degradation rates of isothiazolinones were observed in case of using soil microorganisms over a test period of 120 days by bollmann et al 2017a tixier et al 2000 2001 observed fungal degradation of diuron bollmann et al 2017a also stated lower persistence of tps of oit than tps of terbutryn as it was found here no further tps were found to be formed by biodegradation of photo tps except for the tps that show high rates of degradation the biocides and tps examined here are likely to persist in the aquatic environment for this reason it might be possible to detect them in environmental samples 3 3 occurrence of biocides and their tps in stormwater and groundwater replicates of all analyzed environmental samples showed errors of 16 2 diuron 13 7 terbutryn and 16 8 oit on average indicating that the method applied here was very precise the presence of nine tps in environmental samples could be shown by qualitative target screening with parameters received from photolysis experiments qualitative data was confirmed for tp 212 tp 214 and tp 226 of terbutryn and tp 219 of diuron by repeating the measurements with available reference standards thereby actual concentrations were determined for four out of 14 tps furthermore this re analysis of samples allowed for a confirmation of qualitative results of the previous analyses analyses of the water samples showed that all three biocides could be detected in all sampling types swale trench and groundwater table 3 apart from tp 215 a and tp 215 b of diuron tp 130 of oit and tp 186 and tp 258 of terbutryn all tps could be detected in at least 5 of analyzed samples tps that were persistent in previously described biodegradation tests were found in environmental samples the general low recovery of tps of oit is in line with studies showing that tps tend to remain on facades bollmann et al 2017b and degrade rapidly in soil bollmann et al 2017a tp 226 of terbutryn is usually linked to the plant protection agent terbumeton bollmann et al 2016 but since its use was banned in germany the present results can be explained by the transformation of terbutryn tp 219 of diuron was the most common one in 69 of samples terbutryn detected in 81 of all stormwater samples and its tp 212 75 and tp 214 69 were predominantly found in stormwater samples and diuron 100 and its tp 219 82 in groundwater samples oit occurred infrequently in all sampling types this is in accordance with bollmann et al 2017a 2017b who observed high degradation rates of oit in soil and high retention on facades therefore higher detection frequency of oit in swale water and lower one in trench water and groundwater might be explained by high persistence in surface water chapter 3 2 but low lifetimes in soil phases bollmann et al 2017a 3 3 1 transport of biocides and tps during sw runoff events quantified concentration levels of biocides and their tps in sw runoff fig 2 were in accordance with findings in urban catchments in denmark and switzerland bollmann et al 2014a burkhardt et al 2011 diuron was only detectable in s1 after sw runoff event 1 c 4 9 ng l 1 but in t1 at event 2 which suggests other sources than the infiltrating water from s1 or rather a continuous release from the soil phase its tp 219 was detectable in s1 during event 2 c 2 3 ng l 1 and in the underlying trench in similar concentrations fig 3 most previous studies focused on tp 219 of diuron as a plant protection agent in agriculture field et al 1997 gatidou et al 2004 reemtsma et al 2013 wittmer et al 2010 only a few studies have investigated the occurrence of tp 219 of diuron in urban runoff so far reemtsma et al 2013 wittmer et al 2010 if it was detected at all concentration levels were comparable with those found in this study terbutryn was found in all samples taken from s1 and s2 in a range of 1 160 ng l 1 fig 2 concentrations of terbutryn in s2 cmax s2 6 4 ng l 1 were much lower than in s1 cmax s1 160 ng l 1 which indicates that the concentration in the urban sw strongly depends on the amount of facades and especially their type and age connected to the infiltration system in this case subcatchment 2 was smaller than 1 seven s1 and five s2 terbutryn tps were detected in swale samples both tp 256 and tp 214 occurred frequently in runoff water this result is very much in line with bollmann et al 2016 who showed that of the terbutryn tps leaching from facades tp 214 was the most important one in our study the maximum concentration was 72 8 ng l 1 tp 214 was also present at 2 3 ng l 1 in trench water a result that might be due to retention by the soil layer during the infiltration process however application of its additional parent compound irgarol in the study site cannot be ruled out therefore measured concentrations might not be a result of terbutryn alone tp 212 was present up to 23 2 ng l 1 in swale samples and up to 11 ng l 1 in trench samples it was also detected in urban runoff water in similar concentrations by reemtsma et al 2013 however these authors did not link this tp to terbutryn as its parent compound but to terbutylazin instead tp 226 was not detected in runoff samples this is in accordance with literature which suggest that this is one of the terbutryn tps that tends to remain on facades bollmann et al 2016 here maximum concentrations of tp 226 were detected in trench water 15 9 ng l 1 because the concentrations in trench water were higher than in swale water this tp probably occurred by biodegradation of adsorbed terbutryn on soil bollmann et al 2017a that might had entered by earlier stormwater events therefore it is impossible to trace their environmental fate as precisely as the other tps in general number and concentration of the majority of detected tps decreased in the trench compared to swale water it may thus be concluded that a part was retained in the soil layer without a complete elimination from the water phase oit was only quantifiable in s1 but for all three events in concentrations between 2 5 and 66 8 ng l 1 however oit was not detected in the underlying t1 a result that might be due to retention in the soil layer and more likely its rapid degradation in soil as it has been shown by bollmann et al 2017a the decreasing concentration of biocides during sw events may be caused by the intra event variability of biocide concentrations since the low temporal resolution of two replicates per event is insufficient to display first flush effects olsson et al 2013 3 3 2 infiltration of biocides and tps into groundwater in this study biocides and some tps were detected in infiltrated groundwater of an urban area for the first time other studies focused on groundwater affected by the use of plant protection agents in agriculture and related tps field et al 1997 gooddy et al 2002 quednow and püttmann 2007 reemtsma et al 2013 one study analyzed infiltrated groundwater of a separated sewer system but could not detect biocides bollmann et al 2014b the comparison of mean concentrations of downgradient dg 8 8 ng l 1 groundwater samples of the swale trench system to upgradient ug ones c1 1 ng l 1 showed an increase in the mean concentration of diuron by a factor of 8 fig 4 concentrations of tp 219 were up to cmax 7 3 ng l 1 increasing concentrations in dg samples factor of 3 7 were found for this compound as well due to its presence in s1 and t1 it might have entered groundwater via the swale trench system observed concentrations in groundwater were higher compared to those in stormwater there seemed to be continuous release from the soil phase due to the relatively high adsorption affinity of diuron compared to terbutryn which could be indicated by the retention times terbutryn diuron as a rough approximation additionally for tp 219 it is possible that it was formed by microorganisms in the soil layer terbutryn was only detected in dg samples at maximum concentrations cmax of 7 6 ng l 1 except the three ug samples taken during event 1 and 4 tp 214 of terbutryn was also only detected in dg at cmax 3 3 ng l 1 except two samples in ug this indicates that terbutryn and its tp 214 most likely entered the groundwater via the swale trench system in contrast to the trends observed for terbutryn and diuron concentrations of oit remained unchanged it was detected rather infrequently at the whole study site and only during the second and fourth sampling event cmax 1 4 ng l 1 the low presence of oit and its tps in groundwater samples and the fact that they were not found in trench samples may be an indication for high soil degradation rates as it was stated before bollmann et al 2017a in summary the number of biocides and their tps were higher in the groundwater downgradient 49 of the swale trench system than upgradient 27 the increase of concentrations of diuron terbutryn and their tps in downgradient samples strongly suggests groundwater contamination by the swale trench system however since some of these substances were also detectable in upgradient samples other potential pathways into groundwater need to be considered such as rapid infiltration through gravel filled rims at the basement of facades and diffuse infiltration through grassed and permeable pavements 3 3 3 assessment of biocide transport from facade to sw infiltration by sprinkling experiments during the artificial sprinkling experiment fig 5 diuron leached from the facade with maximum concentrations of 17 7 ng l 1 and was also found in draining and pooling runoffs in s1 cmax 7 7 ng l 1 tp 219 leached from the facade in thirtyfold higher concentrations cmax 691 8 ng l 1 and was also detected in pooling runoff with cmax 378 2 ng l 1 for diuron sprinkling runoff concentrations were similar to those in sw runoff this was however not the case for tp 219 burkhardt et al 2012 found conversely a low recovery of tp 219 on an artificial wall under natural conditions and assumed further degradation processes the duration of exposure and facade material e g pigment color urbanczyk et al 2017 seem to influence the transformation of diuron to tp 219 terbutryn leached from the facade in low concentrations of 0 4 ng l 1 but was detected in higher concentrations in the s1 up to cmax 1 9 ng l 1 oit was only detected in two samples of facade runoff but not in draining or pooling runoff samples not one of its tps was detected given these results it is possible that terbutryn and oit and their tps might have leached from other facades of the contributing drainage areas since both were detected in the swale during sw events the results of the sprinkling experiment suggest that biocidal residues are released from facades and then transported to the swale trench system as discussed in the introduction even a fourteen year old facade still releases biocidal residues higher concentrations of the parent compound can be expected in runoff from newer facades burkhardt et al 2012 the in situ development of tps on facades described in other studies was confirmed here bollmann et al 2016 2017b 4 conclusion this study analyzed the leaching of biocides and their tps from facades during stormwater events into groundwater we combined qualitative target screening with data provided by laboratory photolysis and confirmed the results using reference standards if they were available using this approach we identified three new tps of terbutryn and overall nine different tps in stormwater and groundwater samples this study extends the knowledge on the transport pathways of biocides and their tps in urban stormwater and groundwater facades were confirmed as biocide sources releasing contaminants over their entire life span the comparison of two subcatchments suggests that the mobilized contaminant concentrations strongly depend on study site characteristics such as different facade types and their connection to the stormwater drainage system since groundwater concentrations increased in downgradient groundwater we hypothesize that biocidal groundwater contamination is caused by the investigated infiltration system acknowledgements the

corresponding author fecal indicator bacteria fib are used to assess fecal pollution levels in surface water and are among the criteria used by regulatory agencies to determine water body impairment status while fib provide no information about pollution source microbial source tracking mst does which contributes to more direct and cost effective remediation efforts we studied a watershed in florida managed for wildlife conservation that historically exceeded the state regulatory guideline for fecal coliforms we measured fecal coliforms enterococci a marker gene for avian feces gfd and a marker gene for human associated bacteroides hf183 in sediment vegetation and water samples collected monthly from six sites over two years to 1 assess the influence of site temporal factors and habitat sediment vegetation and water on fib and mst marker concentrations 2 test for correlations among fib and mst markers and 3 determine if avian feces and or human sewage contributed to fib levels sediment and vegetation had significantly higher concentrations of fib and gfd compared to water and thus may serve as microbial reservoirs providing unreliable indications of recent contamination hf183 concentrations were greatest in water samples but were generally near the assay limit of detection hf183 positive results were attributed to white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus feces which provided a false indication of human sewage in this water body fib and gfd were positively correlated while fib and hf183 were negatively correlated we demonstrated that birds not sewage were the main source of fib thus avoiding implementation of a total maximum daily load program tmdl our results demonstrate that the concomitant use of fib and mst can improve decision making and provide direction when water bodies are impaired and provides a strategy for natural source exclusion in water bodies impacted by wild animal feces graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial source tracking fecal indicator bacteria water body management water quality recreational water tmdl 1 introduction the sources of fecal pollution in environmental waters influence human health risk and remediation strategies stoeckel and harwood 2007 yan and sadowsky 2007 soller et al 2010 harwood et al 2014 fecal pollution of water bodies can come from many sources including livestock and wild animals but the original fecal indicator bacteria fib paradigm assumed that the majority of fib originate from human sewage field and samadpour 2007 harwood et al 2014 however fib including fecal coliforms enterococci and escherichia coli inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of most endo and ectotherms gordon and cowling 2003 e g turtles harwood et al 1999 deer kuntz et al 2004 dogs wright et al 2009 alligators johnston et al 2010 and agricultural animals e g cattle swine and poultry sinton et al 2007 usepa 2010 persistence of fib also differ among environmental matrices which we define broadly as sediment vegetation and water for example fib have been found in beach sand alm et al 2003 beversdorf et al 2007 bonilla et al 2007 yamahara et al 2007 eichmiller et al 2014 and sediment lee et al 2006 ishii et al 2007 decaying vegetation i e wrack near marine shores can also serve as a fib source weiskel et al 1996 moreover evidence suggests that submerged aquatic vegetation harbors higher concentrations of fib compared to sediment and water badgley et al 2010 2011 these factors have led to uncertainty about best management practices to reduce levels of these indicators of fecal contamination in spite of the issues cited above recreational water quality is regulated in the united states using fib such as fecal coliforms enterococci or e coli usepa 2012 fdep 2016 in florida for example fecal coliform concentrations should not exceed a monthly average of 200 colony forming units cfu per 100 ml water nor exceed 400 in 10 of the samples nor exceed 800 on any one day fdep 2016 similarly enterococci should not exceed a monthly average of 130 cfu per 100 ml water nor exceed 130 in 10 of the samples usepa 2012 if water bodies consistently exceed state and or usepa water quality guidelines they are placed on an impaired water body list and management organizations are required to develop total maximum daily load tmdl programs which must contain a plan to decrease fib levels however the planning and implementation of tmdl programs is costly e g a 2001 usepa report stated that the national average cost of developing tmdl programs per water body is 52 000 but can range from under 26 000 to over 500 000 the usepa estimated that 17 3 million would be needed annually for tmdl monitoring across the country usepa 2001 because fib are ubiquitous in human and non human sources management organizations have argued for natural source exclusion nse the idea that fib from natural sources should be treated differently for tmdl calculations than those that originate from human sewage or high risk animal sources such as cattle and poultry the usepa has provided technical support for developing site specific water quality criteria which can rely on alternative methods and tools to define impaired waters use of an alternative indicator s that is as protective of public health as the conventional fib water quality standards can provide monetary savings and advantages in terms of ease of use usepa 2014 an alternative indicator or method must first be vetted for performance characteristics and then correlated with an existing epa method or with human health outcomes usepa 2014 achieving nse status can be cost effective because remediation practices and tmdl programs may not be required while testing for pathogens would seem inherently preferable and provide a more straightforward interpretation of human health risk monitoring for all waterborne pathogens is unrealistic due to the diversity and low concentration of pathogens found in most environmental waters harwood et al 2014 the growing need to discriminate between fecal sources led to the development of microbial source tracking mst which aids in host identification for polluted water bodies mst markers target genes of host associated bacteria that are specific to the gastrointestinal gi tract of the host species specificity and ubiquitous within individuals of the host species sensitivity a variety of human associated markers such as hf183 layton et al 2010 seurinck et al 2005 the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov rosario et al 2009 and human polyomaviruses hpyvs mcquaig et al 2009 have been developed in addition to markers for non human sources such as cattle shanks et al 2008 poultry weidhaas et al 2010 ruminants bernhard and field 2000 shorebirds lu et al 2008 and general avian species green et al 2012 mst markers can help identify major sources of fecal pollution which may result in more directed and cost effective remediation efforts for management organizations as alternatives to implementing a tmdl program stoeckel and harwood 2007 mst is not yet widely used in regulatory applications although the usepa is considering adoption of human associated markers harwood et al 2017 we studied a watershed managed for wildlife conservation in central florida where ambient water samples consistently exceeded state regulatory guidelines for fecal coliforms in class iii freshwaters given the limitations of fib as a sole indicator of fecal contamination and the varied levels of fib in environmental matrices we chose to monitor fecal coliforms enterococci a general avian marker gfd and a human associated marker hf183 in sediment vegetation and water our objectives were to follow usepa recommendations for developing site specific criteria which we achieved by 1 quantifying fib and mst markers in sediment vegetation and water 2 determining if avian feces and or human sewage contributed to fib levels 3 assessing whether fib and mst marker concentrations were influenced by matrix year month and sample site and 4 testing for correlations among fib and mst markers independent of matrix year month and sample site 2 methods 2 1 sample sites and collection we studied a watershed managed for wildlife conservation in central florida that was placed on florida s department of environmental protection 303 d water body impairment list in 2010 land use varied from suburban to natural and the stream and associated trees served as a nesting site for various avian species six sites within the water body were used for the duration of the study samples from three environmental matrices sediment vegetation and water were collected monthly from january 2013 to september 2015 water samples were collected at each sampling event but sediment and vegetation samples were not collected during events when water levels were too high or when vegetation was scarce samples from each environmental matrix were collected by boat and transferred to sterile containers vegetation was collected at the surface and stored in gallon ziploc bags sediment was collected at exposed shoreline areas with 50 ml falcon centrifuge tubes corning science reynosa mexico and water samples were collected at the surface with 1000 ml nalgene containers thermo fisher scientific waltham ma water samples for fib enumeration were processed by the management organization at the water body while water samples for mst analysis sediment and vegetation samples were processed on the university of south florida usf campus all samples were processed within 6 h of collection given the known cross reactivity of hf183 with deer feces layton et al 2013 12 discrete rusa deer rusa timorensis fecal samples from australia and five white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus fecal samples from the watershed were collected in january 2014 and processed for dna extraction at usf 2 2 fecal indicator bacteria fib fecal coliforms and enterococci were enumerated for each environmental matrix the management organization processed water samples using standard method 9221e apha 2012 and idexx enterolert idexx laboratories inc westbrook maine for fecal

colony forming units cfu 100g wet weight at the end of the experiment sample sizes for fecal coliforms n 477 and enterococci n 470 were unequal because some enterococci plates were uncountable due to interference from the environmental matrix positive and negative controls for the selective media difco mfc and difo mei becton dickinson sparks md were used in each sampling event for positive controls pure cultures were streaked on the selective media plates e coli 9637 for fecal coliforms on mfc agar enterococcus faecalis 19433 for enterococci on mei agar and incubated at respective optimal temperatures with the samples for negative controls pure cultures of e coli 9637 were streaked on mei agar and e faecalis 19433 was streaked on mfc agar and incubated with all other samples 2

at 80 c until later processing with the powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca using the manufacturer s instructions white tailed deer fecal samples were processed immediately upon arrival or were stored at 80 c until dna extraction for dna extraction 0 3g of deer feces was added directly to a powerbead tube and processed using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca all samples of final eluent from dna extraction were diluted 1 5 volume volume in nuclease free water to assess inhibition an extraction blank powerbead tube with nothing added was subjected to all steps in the extraction protocol and was used as an extraction control 2 4 qpcr analysis of mst markers dna extracted from all environmental matrices was tested for mst markers that identify avian and human fecal sources using qpcr a general avian marker gfd green et al 2012 and human associated bacteroides hf183 marker bernhard and field 2000 seurinck et al 2005 were used for all qpcr analyses samples were run in duplicate and quantities were interpolated by comparison to a standard curve the standard curve was constructed from plasmid dna containing the

vulnificus is an opportunistic human pathogen that is autochthonous to estuarine and marine waters therefore the probability of its presence in a freshwater system was negligible sample dna 5 μl was spiked with 2 0 104 gene copies of plasmid dna containing the target sequence for v vulnificus and a sybr green qpcr method wright et al 2007 staley et al 2013a was used to determine the copy number recovered from samples after qpcr by extrapolating to a standard curve the average copy number recovered from spiked nuclease free water 5 μl of nuclease free water spiked with 2 0 104 gene copies was used as a bench mark for all samples tested standard curves for gfd and hf183 were analyzed according to published minimum information for publication of quantitative real time pcr experiments miqe guidelines bustin et al 2010 forootan et al 2017 and were similar to those reported in previous studies green et al 2014 ahmed et al 2016 symonds et al 2017 for the duration of the study the mean slope r2 and efficiency for gfd was 3 6 0 989 and 88 8 respectively the mean slope r2 and efficiency for hf183 was 3 5 0 991 and 92 6 respectively limits of detection were defined as the lowest concentration of target gene copies that could be reliably detected above the negative control for each qpcr run limits of quantification were based on the standard curve and defined as the concentration of target gene copies wherein the standard deviation for all replicates was less than or equal to 2 ct two components were considered for reliability of detection 1 amplification of both duplicates and 2 the mean cycle threshold ct value was lower than that of the negative control blank results from qpcr were deemed quantifiable and reported as mean concentrations of the duplicate qpcr reactions if ct values for the duplicate qpcr reactions fell within 2 standard deviations of one another and they were above the level of the lowest standard qpcr results deemed non quantifiable were characterized as non detectable nd or detected but not quantifiable dnq if zero or one well was amplified the result was deemed nd and was designated a value half of the limit of detection in the data set if both duplicates amplified the result was deemed dnq and assigned the value of the limit of detection lod in the data set therefore dnq values were twice that of nd values 2 5 cross reactivity of hf183 dna was extracted from five discrete water samples and five white tailed deer o virginianus fecal samples collected on site in january 2014 samples were tested for hf183 using both conventional bernhard and field 2000 and qpcr seurinck et al 2005 dna was also extracted from 12 discrete rusa deer rusa timorensis fecal samples from australia to compare presence of hf183 across geographic regions for sequence comparison a 525 bp region of the bacteroidales 16s rrna gene was amplified from the water and local deer fecal samples using the conventional pcr primer pair 183f and 708r and cloned into competent e coli cells using the topo ta cloning kit invitrogen carlsbad ca sequences were aligned using clustalw mega 6 0 and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining algorithm the 16s rrna gene sequence for bacteroides dorei genbank nr 041351 was included in the analyses along with the sequence of an uncultured bacteroidales strain genbank ef704867 1 source human gastrointestinal for comparison eight sequences from water samples two each from sites 1 4 6 and one each from sites 2 and 5 and five sequences from deer fecal samples were

fib and geometric means for mst statistical analyses were conducted using r 3 2 4 team 2017 all packages and functions are listed in a supplementary table table s1 first different transformations were tested logarithmic square root and fourth root to comply with statistical assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity bartlett 1937 royston 1982 the log10 x 1 transformation was retained because it had the greatest performance and accounted for non detect values table s1 because management organizations sample water but not sediment and vegetation we initially calculated the frequency of exceedance of regulatory guidelines for fib i e fecal coliforms and enterococci across years and sites in water samples table s2 regulatory levels were considered 400 cfu 100 ml and 130 cfu 100 ml for fecal coliforms and enterococci respectively usepa 2012 fdep 2016 sediment and vegetation are not subject to regulatory guidelines therefore exceedances were not calculated for those samples next we calculated the geometric means and frequency of detection for gfd and hf183 across environmental matrices years and sites to compare their concentration and environmental persistence table s4 2 5 2 anova and mixed effects anova we used an anova to assess fib concentrations in water as a function of year month and site the variance attributed to these predictors was quantified using an adjusted r2 value mixed effects anova were then used to assess the relationships among fib and mst markers i e fecal coliforms enterococci gfd and hf183 as a function of matrix i e sediment vegetation and water while accounting for the spatial and temporal dependency of observations gelman and hill 2007 zuur et al 2009 emi fergus et al 2011 nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 for each fib and mst marker we compared models with matrix as a fixed effect and all possible combinations of year month and site as categorical random effects table 1 akaike information criterion aic a relative measure of performance for a statistical model zuur et al 2009 emi fergus et al 2011 was used to compare all mixed effects anova models required normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were confirmed by visually inspecting plots of the fitted values versus the residuals of the mixed effects anova zuur et al 2009 mixed effects anova models with the lowest aic values were retained and one best fit model was chosen per fib and mst marker when aic were similar i e within three aic the model with the least number of random effects was chosen for all fib and mst markers the proportion of the variance explained by fixed effects i e matrix was quantified using marginal r2 and the variance explained by both fixed and random effects i e matrix and year month and site was quantified using conditional r2 nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 johnson 2014 table s4 therefore the difference between conditional r2 and marginal r2 values corresponds to the proportion of variance accounted for by the random effects i e year month and site the predictive power of best fit mixed effects anova for each fib and mst marker was assessed by cross validation jackknife leave one out procedure which iteratively removes one sample from the data set and predicts the fib or mst concentration for that sample using the model developed with the remaining data set this was done until each fib and mst marker concentration from every sample was predicted the model s predictive power was quantified by p2 guénard et al 2013 this value is bound between and 1 where a p2 of 1 indicates that all predictions perfectly match the observations a p2 above 0 indicates accurate predictions and a p2 equal to or below 0 indicates poor model performance cross validation ensured that our models were not over fitted when comparing aic values over fitted models can have high r2 values but subsequently low p2 values which indicates the model is specific for the data set and results cannot be applied generally 2 5 3 correlations between fib and mst lastly we assessed associations between fecal coliforms and enterococci fecal coliforms and gfd fecal coliforms and hf183 enterococci and gfd and enterococci and hf183 independent of year month and site using kendall s non parametric measure of correlation which allows for departure from normality and for non linear relationships hollander and wolfe 1973 table s1 3 results 3 1 fib analysis water sediment and vegetation samples were analyzed for fecal coliforms fc and enterococci ent concentrations fig 1 fc and ent concentrations were significantly greater in sediment and vegetation compared to water fig 1 fc levels in sediment were approximately two orders of magnitude greater than in water while the corresponding comparison for ent showed sediment and vegetation levels approximately 1 5 orders of magnitude greater than that in water fc and ent had geometric means of 75 and 168 mpn 100 ml in water respectively fig 1 site 6 had significantly lower mean fc concentrations than site 2 p value 0 0294 table s3 the highest fc concentrations across years occurred in january and march p value 0 0007 and 0 0445 year month and site accounted for almost ¼ of the variance observed in fc concentration levels adjusted r2 23 5 mean ent levels were also elevated in january and march as well as june across years and were significantly greater than ent levels in december p values 0 027 0 0009 0 0002 0 0007 table s3 almost half the ent variance observed could be attributed to year month and site adjusted r2 42 7 fc concentrations exceeded state of florida regulatory guidelines in 20 of water samples across sites and years exceedances were most frequent at sites 1 24 2 and 2 30 3 ent concentrations exceeded regulatory guidelines in 63 2 of water samples across sites and years fig 2 table s2 3 2 microbial source tracking across all environmental matrices levels of the general avian marker gfd n 398 ranged between 102 106 gene copies 100 ml or 100 g on a log10 scale while levels of the human associated marker hf183 n 333 ranged between 100 103 gene copies 100 ml or 100 g on a log10 scale fig 1 table s4 geometric means for gfd were highest in sediment 3 81 103 gene copies 100g followed by vegetation 2 39 103 gene copies 100g and lowest in water 2 55 102 gene copies 100 ml table s4 in contrast hf183 had overall geometric means of 2 01 101 gene copies 100g 1 82 101 gene copies 100g and 7 68 101 gene copies 100 ml in sediment vegetation and water respectively table s4 the frequency of gfd detection was 74 7 71 6 and 76 5 in sediment vegetation and water samples respectively while hf183 was detected in 63 4 of water samples the human associated marker was rarely detected in sediment 19 2 and vegetation 22 8 and levels of hf183 were near the limit of detection in most samples table s4 fig 1 3 3 cross reactivity of hf183 dna extracted from five discrete water samples collected in january 2014 as well as the dna extracted from five white tailed deer fecal samples tested positive for hf183 using both conventional and qpcr hf183 amplicon sequences from water and deer fecal samples demonstrated 99 sequence identity with each other and 95 similarity with the 16s rrna sequence of bacteroides dorei a target of many human source mst assays bernhard and field 2000 haugland et al 2010 harwood et al 2014 fig 3 sequences from water and deer fecal samples were also closely related to the 16s rrna gene of an uncultured bacteroidales sequence from human feces genbank ef704867 1 source human gastrointestinal primers and probe sequences for the hf183 qpcr assay were 100 identical to the partial 16s rrna gene sequence of a representative deer fecal sample data not shown hf183 was not detected by qpcr in any of 12 australian rusa deer r timorensis fecal samples 3 4 influence of environmental variables on fib and mst marker levels mixed effects anova determined whether variations in fib or mst concentration could be attributed to and predicted by matrix or year month and site the best combination of variables for mixed effects anova based on aic values included year and month for ent gfd and hf183 fc had two competing models within 1 9 aic so the model with the least number of random effects i e years and months was chosen table 1 for both fc and ent the fixed effect i e matrix explained more variation than random effects i e years and months vegetation had significantly higher concentrations of fc and ent p value 0 0026 and 0 0001 followed by sediment p value 0 0001 and 0 0001 and water p value 0 0001 and 0 0001 on an untransformed scale fc concentrations were 129 and 68 times higher in vegetation and sediment respectively compared to water whereas ent concentrations were 40 and 12 times higher in vegetation and sediment respectively compared to water the variation in fc explained by environmental matrix corresponded to 53 9 marginal r2 and including the effect of years and months only increased the explained variation by 8 3 similarly the variation in ent explained by environmental matrix was 36 9 marginal r2 and including the effect of years and months only increased the explained variation by 8 2 table s4 random effect coefficients years and months suggested that concentrations of fc and ent were larger in 2013 intermediate in 2014 and smaller in 2015 no clear monthly patterns could be identified across years fig s1 in contrast to fib results random effects accounted for more variation than fixed effects for both gfd and hf183 sediment and vegetation had significantly greater concentrations of gfd than water p value 0 0001 on an untransformed scale gfd concentrations in sediment and vegetation were eight and three times higher than concentrations found in water respectively conversely sediment and vegetation had significantly lower concentrations of hf183 than water p value 0 0001 hf183 concentrations in sediment and vegetation were three times lower than concentrations found in water the variation in gfd explained by environmental matrix was 3 2 while the effect of years and months accounted for 43 1 of the variation for hf183 4 1 of the variation was explained by environmental matrix and the effect of years and months accounted for 50 3 table s4 gfd concentrations were larger in 2015 intermediate in 2014 and smaller in 2013 whereas hf183 concentrations were larger in 2014 intermediate in 2013 and smaller in 2015 no clear monthly patterns could be identified across years fig s1 similar explanatory conditional r2 and predictive power p2 indicated that chosen models were not over fitted and provided robust predictions fig 4 table s4 in accordance with our marginal and conditional r2 values for fc and ent matrix accounted for much variation in this dataset and environmental matrix clustered by type whereas the opposite trend was evident for gfd and hf183 fig 4 3 5 correlations between microbial variables we observed positive correlations between fc and ent tau 0 58 p value 2 2 10 16 fc and gfd tau 0 13 p value 0 0009 and ent and gfd tau 0 13 p value 0 0007 whereas negative correlations were observed between fc and hf183 tau 0 19 p value 3 51 10 6 and ent and hf183 tau 0 13 p value 0 001 4 discussion we examined a watershed managed for wildlife conservation to identify host types that contributed to elevated fib levels abundant populations of wild birds whose numbers peak in the winter months led us to include the gfd marker while the upstream presence of urban suburban development prompted the use of the human associated hf183 marker sediment and vegetation as well as water were sampled as previous studies suggested that these matrices can serve as reservoirs of fib in sub tropical waters badgley et al 2010 2011 chase et al 2012 however they have rarely been assessed for mst markers the water body we studied was placed on the florida department of environmental protection s 303 d list in 2010 because ambient water samples from site 2 consistently exceeded state regulatory guidelines for fc this designation was consistent with site 2 having the highest frequency of exceedance for fc throughout our study 2013 2015 fig 2 moreover january and march had the highest mean fc concentrations across years bird count data provided by the management organization data not shown coincided with high fc concentrations at site 2 bird count data at the same site also coincided with high concentrations of ent during january march and june migratory bird populations may therefore be the mechanism by which fib enter the water body similar trends have been observed in previous studies wright et al 2009 wu et al 2017 when we included environmental matrix in our models sediment and vegetation harbored fib concentrations one to two orders of magnitude greater than concentrations found in water for the entire sampling period fig 1 here we would like to note that diverse practices for expressing the concentration of bacteria in sediment soil particles with interstitial water and vegetation exist in the literature for example imamura et al 2011 compared fib in sand sediment and beach wrack with values normalized to dry weight this methodology cannot be applied to comparisons between solid substrates and water while we recognize that the comparison is not perfect we normalized water and sediment values essentially to wet weight as water weighs 100 g 100 ml this strategy allows a more realistic comparison than fib g dry weight of sediment which greatly elevates the calculations of fib in sediments compared to water this method can also be employed for vegetation which is relatively rarely sampled in comparable studies for publications in which this methodology is used see lee et al 2006 badgley et al 2011 and staley et al 2013b overall observing higher fib concentrations in sediment and vegetation than water was an expected trend and supports previous research that sediment and vegetation are reservoirs of fib in water bodies alm et al 2003 beversdorf et al 2007 coulliette and noble 2008 badgley et al 2011 byappanahalli et al 2012 accordingly the best fit mixed effects anova in our study confirms the predictive power of environmental matrix for fc and ent concentrations fig 4 table s5 thus if sediment and vegetation periodically contribute fib from older fecal sources to the water column sampling water alone may not give an accurate portrayal of current fecal pollution risk lee et al 2006 badgley et al 2010 fib in sediment and vegetation may provide false indications of recent contamination and could incur costly mitigation efforts in the absence of human health risk the gfd bird marker was consistently present at relatively high levels across all sites indicating the pervasive influence of bird feces on fib levels hf183 in contrast was detected sporadically at low levels because both mst markers had non detects that resulted in left censored data we substituted the lod divided by 2 for these values in both datasets the use of lod 2 for non detectable data points is valid according to standard practices and recommendations as long as it does not create a dataset that violates the assumptions of the statistical methodology employed usepa 2006 levine et al 2009 authority 2010 many recent publications have used this method for dealing with non detect observations e g chase et al 2015 imamura et al 2011 ravaliya et al 2014 and schriewer et al 2015 alternatives to substitution for left censored values have been advocated helsel 2005 2006 including bayesian and nonparametric analyses paulo et al 2005 kennedy 2010 wangkahad et al 2017 on the grounds that using a single substituted value for many data points can skew a dataset given that we had large datasets for fecal coliforms n 477 enterococci n 470 gfd n 398 and hf183 n 333 and all assumptions for anova and mix effects anova were met i e data normality and homoscedasticity normality of the residuals of the models no relationship between residuals and predicted values after data transformation i e log10 x 1 and independency of observations we chose to employ the lod 2 value for non detect samples the relatively weak persistence of hf183 in sediment zimmer faust et al 2017 offers one potential explanation of why the human associated marker was detected more frequently in water than sediment according to zimmer faust et al 2017 hf183 exhibited decay rates 2 5 times faster than culturable fib in sediment similar experiments to compare decay rates of fib and mst markers in vegetation have not been conducted but our results and those of previous studies suggest that a similar trend may hold e coli for example readily grow on shoreline wrack nevers et al 2016 and seaweeds enhance survival of e coli in beach sand quilliam et al 2014 enterococci have also been found to grow on vegetation badgley et al 2010 confirmation of cross reactivity of hf183 with white tailed deer feces in this water body supported our interpretations of the mst results as detection of hf183 may well have been due to contamination by deer feces rather than sewage consequently the hf183 marker was not a reliable indicator of human fecal contamination in this water body subsequent testing using alternative indicators of human fecal contamination the sewage associated pepper mild mottle virus pmmov rosario et al 2009 and human polyomaviruses hpyvs mcquaig et al 2009 yielded negative results across all environmental matrices years months and sites data not shown small differences between the dna sequences analyzed in this study offer an opportunity to design qpcr assays that could discriminate between deer and human sources of bacteroides an improved hf183 qpcr assay was recently developed by green et al 2014 who optimized the hf183 assay by pairing the same forward primer hf183 used in this study with a new reverse primer bacr287 this increased the target gene length from 80 bp this study to 126 bp hf183 bacr287 the sensitivity and specificity of the hf183 bacr287 assay was determined to be similar to or better than the hf183 bfdrev assay overall the detection of hf183 in florida white tailed deer feces but not in australian rusa deer feces indicates geographic variability of the marker and supports the importance of testing for mst marker specificity on local fecal samples fc and ent were positively correlated as expected additional positive correlations between both fib and gfd provided evidence that elevated levels of fib were likely due to birds and not humans by quantifying both fib and mst markers we identified birds as a major contributor of fecal pollution in this water body moreover fib were negatively correlated with hf183 concentrations which has also been found in a previous study sauer et al 2011 adding to the weight of evidence indicating that sewage was not an important contributor to fib in the watershed these results demonstrate the importance of a toolbox approach to assessing water quality and human health risk the data collected in this study allowed the management organization to meet its designated use as a wildlife conservation site natural source exclusion nse status was obtained and the water body was removed from the 303 d impaired water body list by the florida department of environmental protection if regulatory agencies adopt methods similar to those used in this study funds could more effectively be allocated towards maintaining and improving water quality instead of implementing unnecessary mitigation efforts for water bodies that do not pose a human health risk overall our results lend credence to the growing body of evidence that using culture based methods for fib alone provides an incomplete indication of microbial water quality and human health risk harwood et al 2005 schoen et al 2011 kirs et al 2017 while monitoring both fib and mst markers over a spatiotemporal scale is more informative of possible sources of fecal pollution harwood et al 2011 2017 mcquaig et al 2012 riedel et al 2015 5 conclusion low levels and intermittent detection of hf183 coupled with consistent detection of gfd supported our hypothesis that elevated fib levels were due to bird and not human fecal contamination cross reactivity of the human associated hf183 marker with local deer feces and a plentiful deer population explained the intermittent presence of hf183 in the water body predictive modeling poses a novel method for informing management organizations of likely factors influencing fecal pollution intensity and how to mitigate future fecal pollution events our study provides an example of how quantifying both fib and mst markers in different environmental matrices can improve water quality assessment and help tailor tmdl programs for impaired water bodies in the future

corresponding author fecal indicator bacteria fib are used to assess fecal pollution levels in surface water and are among the criteria used by regulatory agencies to determine water body impairment status while fib provide no information about pollution source microbial source tracking mst does which contributes to more direct and cost effective remediation efforts we studied a watershed in florida managed for wildlife conservation that historically exceeded the state regulatory guideline for fecal coliforms we measured fecal coliforms enterococci a marker gene for avian feces gfd and a marker gene for human associated bacteroides hf183 in sediment vegetation and water samples collected monthly from six sites over two years to 1 assess the influence of site temporal factors and habitat sediment vegetation and water on fib and mst marker concentrations 2 test for correlations among fib and mst markers and 3 determine if avian feces and or human sewage contributed to fib levels sediment and vegetation had significantly higher concentrations of fib and gfd compared to water and thus may serve as microbial reservoirs providing unreliable indications of recent contamination hf183 concentrations were greatest in water samples but were generally near the assay limit of detection hf183 positive results were attributed to white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus feces which provided a false indication of human sewage in this water body fib and gfd were positively correlated while fib and hf183 were negatively correlated we demonstrated that birds not sewage were the main source of fib thus avoiding implementation of a total maximum daily load program tmdl our results demonstrate that the concomitant use of fib and mst can improve decision making and provide direction when water bodies are impaired and provides a strategy for natural source exclusion in water bodies impacted by wild animal feces graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial source tracking fecal indicator bacteria water body management water quality recreational water tmdl 1 introduction the sources of fecal pollution in environmental waters influence human health risk and remediation strategies stoeckel and harwood 2007 yan and sadowsky 2007 soller et al 2010 harwood et al 2014 fecal pollution of water bodies can come from many sources including livestock and wild animals but the original fecal indicator bacteria fib paradigm assumed that the majority of fib originate from human sewage field and samadpour 2007 harwood et al 2014 however fib including fecal coliforms enterococci and escherichia coli inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of most endo and ectotherms gordon and cowling 2003 e g turtles harwood et al 1999 deer kuntz et al 2004 dogs wright et al 2009 alligators johnston et al 2010 and agricultural animals e g cattle swine and poultry sinton et al 2007 usepa 2010 persistence of fib also differ among environmental matrices which we define broadly as sediment vegetation and water for example fib have been found in beach sand alm et al 2003 beversdorf et al 2007 bonilla et al 2007 yamahara et al 2007 eichmiller et al 2014 and sediment lee et al 2006 ishii et al 2007 decaying vegetation i e wrack near marine shores can also serve as a fib source weiskel et al 1996 moreover evidence suggests that submerged aquatic vegetation harbors higher concentrations of fib compared to sediment and water badgley et al 2010 2011 these factors have led to uncertainty about best management practices to reduce levels of these indicators of fecal contamination in spite of the issues cited above recreational water quality is regulated in the united states using fib such as fecal coliforms enterococci or e coli usepa 2012 fdep 2016 in florida for example fecal coliform concentrations should not exceed a monthly average of 200 colony forming units cfu per 100 ml water nor exceed 400 in 10 of the samples nor exceed 800 on any one day fdep 2016 similarly enterococci should not exceed a monthly average of 130 cfu per 100 ml water nor exceed 130 in 10 of the samples usepa 2012 if water bodies consistently exceed state and or usepa water quality guidelines they are placed on an impaired water body list and management organizations are required to develop total maximum daily load tmdl programs which must contain a plan to decrease fib levels however the planning and implementation of tmdl programs is costly e g a 2001 usepa report stated that the national average cost of developing tmdl programs per water body is 52 000 but can range from under 26 000 to over 500 000 the usepa estimated that 17 3 million would be needed annually for tmdl monitoring across the country usepa 2001 because fib are ubiquitous in human and non human sources management organizations have argued for natural source exclusion nse the idea that fib from natural sources should be treated differently for tmdl calculations than those that originate from human sewage or high risk animal sources such as cattle and poultry the usepa has provided technical support for developing site specific water quality criteria which can rely on alternative methods and tools to define impaired waters use of an alternative indicator s that is as protective of public health as the conventional fib water quality standards can provide monetary savings and advantages in terms of ease of use usepa 2014 an alternative indicator or method must first be vetted for performance characteristics and then correlated with an existing epa method or with human health outcomes usepa 2014 achieving nse status can be cost effective because remediation practices and tmdl programs may not be required while testing for pathogens would seem inherently preferable and provide a more straightforward interpretation of human health risk monitoring for all waterborne pathogens is unrealistic due to the diversity and low concentration of pathogens found in most environmental waters harwood et al 2014 the growing need to discriminate between fecal sources led to the development of microbial source tracking mst which aids in host identification for polluted water bodies mst markers target genes of host associated bacteria that are specific to the gastrointestinal gi tract of the host species specificity and ubiquitous within individuals of the host species sensitivity a variety of human associated markers such as hf183 layton et al 2010 seurinck et al 2005 the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov rosario et al 2009 and human polyomaviruses hpyvs mcquaig et al 2009 have been developed in addition to markers for non human sources such as cattle shanks et al 2008 poultry weidhaas et al 2010 ruminants bernhard and field 2000 shorebirds lu et al 2008 and general avian species green et al 2012 mst markers can help identify major sources of fecal pollution which may result in more directed and cost effective remediation efforts for management organizations as alternatives to implementing a tmdl program stoeckel and harwood 2007 mst is not yet widely used in regulatory applications although the usepa is considering adoption of human associated markers harwood et al 2017 we studied a watershed managed for wildlife conservation in central florida where ambient water samples consistently exceeded state regulatory guidelines for fecal coliforms in class iii freshwaters given the limitations of fib as a sole indicator of fecal contamination and the varied levels of fib in environmental matrices we chose to monitor fecal coliforms enterococci a general avian marker gfd and a human associated marker hf183 in sediment vegetation and water our objectives were to follow usepa recommendations for developing site specific criteria which we achieved by 1 quantifying fib and mst markers in sediment vegetation and water 2 determining if avian feces and or human sewage contributed to fib levels 3 assessing whether fib and mst marker concentrations were influenced by matrix year month and sample site and 4 testing for correlations among fib and mst markers independent of matrix year month and sample site 2 methods 2 1 sample sites and collection we studied a watershed managed for wildlife conservation in central florida that was placed on florida s department of environmental protection 303 d water body impairment list in 2010 land use varied from suburban to natural and the stream and associated trees served as a nesting site for various avian species six sites within the water body were used for the duration of the study samples from three environmental matrices sediment vegetation and water were collected monthly from january 2013 to september 2015 water samples were collected at each sampling event but sediment and vegetation samples were not collected during events when water levels were too high or when vegetation was scarce samples from each environmental matrix were collected by boat and transferred to sterile containers vegetation was collected at the surface and stored in gallon ziploc bags sediment was collected at exposed shoreline areas with 50 ml falcon centrifuge tubes corning science reynosa mexico and water samples were collected at the surface with 1000 ml nalgene containers thermo fisher scientific waltham ma water samples for fib enumeration were processed by the management organization at the water body while water samples for mst analysis sediment and vegetation samples were processed on the university of south florida usf campus all samples were processed within 6 h of collection given the known cross reactivity of hf183 with deer feces layton et al 2013 12 discrete rusa deer rusa timorensis fecal samples from australia and five white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus fecal samples from the watershed were collected in january 2014 and processed for dna extraction at usf 2 2 fecal indicator bacteria fib fecal coliforms and enterococci were

markers that identify avian and human fecal sources using qpcr a general avian marker gfd green et al 2012 and human associated bacteroides hf183 marker bernhard and field 2000 seurinck et al 2005 were used for all qpcr analyses samples were run in duplicate and quantities were interpolated by comparison to a standard curve the standard curve was constructed from plasmid dna containing the target sequence at ten fold dilutions ranging in concentration from 106 to 101 gene copies per reaction in addition negative controls for the qpcr reaction and for the extraction process no template added were included on each qpcr plate run gene copy quantities were calculated as the mean concentration of duplicate reactions and reported as per 100g wet weight of sediment and vegetation or per 100 ml of water all assays were run using an abi 7500 real time pcr system thermo fisher scientific waltham ma at usf qpcr of gfd was based on a previously published method green et al 2012 samples

thermocycler conditions were as follows 2 min at 50 c 10 min at 95 c 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 1 min at 60 c a qpcr assay for vibrio vulnificus was used to test for inhibition of the qpcr v vulnificus is an opportunistic human pathogen that is autochthonous to estuarine and marine waters therefore the probability of its presence in a freshwater system was negligible sample dna 5 μl was spiked with 2 0 104 gene copies of plasmid dna containing the target sequence for v vulnificus and a sybr green qpcr method wright et al 2007 staley et al 2013a was used to determine the copy number recovered from samples after qpcr by extrapolating to a standard curve the average copy number recovered from spiked nuclease free water 5 μl of nuclease free water spiked with 2 0 104 gene copies was used as a bench mark for all samples tested standard curves for gfd and hf183 were analyzed according to published minimum information for publication of quantitative real time pcr experiments miqe guidelines bustin et al 2010 forootan et al 2017 and were similar to those reported in previous studies green et al 2014 ahmed et al 2016 symonds et al 2017 for the duration of the study the mean slope r2 and efficiency for gfd was 3 6 0 989 and 88 8 respectively the mean slope r2 and efficiency for hf183 was 3 5 0 991 and 92 6 respectively limits of detection were defined as the lowest concentration of target gene copies that could be reliably detected above the negative control for each qpcr run limits of quantification were based on the standard curve and defined as the concentration of target gene copies wherein the standard deviation for all replicates was less than or equal to 2 ct two components were considered for reliability of detection 1 amplification of both duplicates and 2 the mean cycle threshold ct value was lower than that of the negative control blank results from qpcr were deemed quantifiable and reported as mean concentrations of the duplicate qpcr reactions if ct values for the duplicate qpcr reactions fell within 2 standard deviations of one another and they were above the level of the lowest standard qpcr results deemed non quantifiable were characterized as non detectable nd or detected but not quantifiable dnq if zero or one well was amplified the result was deemed nd and was designated a value half of the limit of detection in the data set if both duplicates amplified the result was deemed dnq and assigned the value of the limit of detection lod in the data set therefore dnq values were twice that of nd values 2 5 cross reactivity of hf183 dna was extracted from five discrete water samples and five white tailed deer o virginianus fecal samples collected on site in january 2014 samples were tested for hf183 using both conventional bernhard and field 2000 and qpcr seurinck et al 2005 dna was also extracted from 12 discrete rusa deer rusa timorensis fecal samples from australia to compare presence of hf183 across geographic regions for sequence comparison a 525 bp region of the bacteroidales 16s rrna gene was amplified from the water and local deer fecal samples using the conventional pcr primer pair 183f and 708r and cloned into competent e coli cells using the topo ta cloning kit invitrogen carlsbad ca sequences were aligned using clustalw mega 6 0 and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining algorithm the 16s rrna gene sequence for bacteroides dorei genbank nr 041351 was included in the analyses along with the sequence of an uncultured bacteroidales strain genbank ef704867 1 source human gastrointestinal for comparison eight sequences from water samples two each from sites 1 4 6 and one each from sites 2 and 5 and five sequences from deer fecal samples were deposited in genbank under accession numbers mg970697 mg970698 mg970699 mg970700 mg970701 mg970702 mg970703 mg970704 mg970705 mg970706 mg970707 mg970708 and mg970709 2 5 1 calculating exceedances for fib and geometric means for mst statistical analyses were conducted using r 3 2 4 team 2017 all packages and functions are listed in a supplementary table table s1 first different transformations were tested logarithmic square root and fourth root to comply with statistical assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity bartlett 1937 royston 1982 the log10 x 1 transformation was retained because it had the greatest performance and accounted for non detect values table s1 because management organizations sample water but not sediment and vegetation we initially calculated the frequency of exceedance of regulatory guidelines for fib i e fecal coliforms and enterococci across years and sites in water samples table s2 regulatory levels were considered 400 cfu 100 ml and 130 cfu 100 ml for fecal coliforms and enterococci respectively usepa 2012 fdep 2016 sediment and vegetation are not subject to regulatory guidelines therefore exceedances were not calculated for those samples next we calculated the geometric means and frequency of detection for gfd and hf183 across environmental matrices years and sites to compare their concentration and environmental persistence table s4 2 5 2 anova and mixed effects anova we used an anova to assess fib concentrations in water as a function of year month and site the variance attributed to these predictors was quantified using an adjusted r2 value mixed effects anova were then used to assess the relationships among fib and mst markers i e fecal coliforms enterococci gfd and hf183 as a function of matrix i e sediment vegetation and water while accounting for the spatial and temporal dependency of observations gelman and hill 2007 zuur et al 2009 emi fergus et al 2011 nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 for each fib and mst marker we compared models with matrix as a fixed effect and all possible combinations of year month and site as categorical random effects table 1 akaike information criterion aic a relative measure of performance for a statistical model zuur et al 2009 emi fergus et al 2011 was used to compare all mixed effects anova models required normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were confirmed by visually inspecting plots of the fitted values versus the residuals of the mixed effects anova zuur et al 2009 mixed effects anova models with the lowest aic values were retained and one best fit model was chosen per fib and mst marker when aic were similar i e within three aic the model with the least number of random effects was chosen for all fib and mst markers the proportion of the variance explained by fixed effects i e matrix was quantified using marginal r2 and the variance explained by both fixed and random effects i e matrix and year month and site was quantified using conditional r2 nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 johnson 2014 table s4 therefore the difference between conditional r2 and marginal r2 values corresponds to the proportion of variance accounted for by the random effects i e year month and site the predictive power of best fit mixed effects anova for each fib and mst marker was assessed by cross validation jackknife leave one out procedure which iteratively removes one sample from the data set and predicts the fib or mst concentration for that sample using the model developed with the remaining data set this was done until each fib and mst marker concentration from every sample was predicted the model s predictive power was quantified by p2 guénard et al 2013 this value is bound between and 1 where a p2 of 1 indicates that all predictions perfectly match the observations a p2 above 0 indicates accurate predictions and a p2 equal to or below 0 indicates poor model performance cross validation ensured that our models were not over fitted when comparing aic values over fitted models can have high r2 values but subsequently low p2 values which indicates the model is specific for the data set and results cannot be applied generally 2 5 3 correlations between fib and mst lastly we assessed associations between fecal coliforms and enterococci fecal coliforms and gfd fecal coliforms and hf183 enterococci and gfd and enterococci and hf183 independent of year month and site using kendall s non parametric measure of correlation which allows for departure from normality and for non linear relationships hollander and wolfe 1973 table s1 3 results 3 1 fib analysis water sediment and vegetation samples were analyzed for fecal coliforms fc and enterococci ent concentrations fig 1 fc and ent concentrations were significantly greater in sediment and vegetation compared to water fig 1 fc levels in sediment were approximately two orders of magnitude greater than in water while the corresponding comparison for ent showed sediment and vegetation levels approximately 1 5 orders of magnitude greater than that in water fc and ent had geometric means of 75 and 168 mpn 100 ml in water respectively fig 1 site 6 had significantly lower mean fc concentrations than site 2 p value 0 0294 table s3 the highest fc concentrations across years occurred in january and march p value 0 0007 and 0 0445 year month and site accounted for almost ¼ of the variance observed in fc concentration levels adjusted r2 23 5 mean ent levels were also elevated in january and march as well as june across years and were significantly greater than ent levels in december p values 0 027 0 0009 0 0002 0 0007 table s3 almost half the ent variance observed could be attributed to year month and site adjusted r2 42 7 fc concentrations exceeded state of florida regulatory guidelines in 20 of water samples across sites and years exceedances were most frequent at sites 1 24 2 and 2 30 3 ent concentrations exceeded regulatory guidelines in 63 2 of water samples across sites and years fig 2 table s2 3 2 microbial source tracking across all environmental matrices levels of the general avian marker gfd n 398 ranged between 102 106 gene copies 100 ml or 100 g on a log10 scale while levels of the human associated marker hf183 n 333 ranged between 100 103 gene copies 100 ml or 100 g on a log10 scale fig 1 table s4 geometric means for gfd were highest in sediment 3 81 103 gene copies 100g followed by vegetation 2 39 103 gene copies 100g and lowest in water 2 55 102 gene copies 100 ml table s4 in contrast hf183 had overall geometric means of 2 01 101 gene copies 100g 1 82 101 gene copies 100g and 7 68 101 gene copies 100 ml in sediment vegetation and water respectively table s4 the frequency of gfd detection was 74 7 71 6 and 76 5 in sediment vegetation and water samples respectively while hf183 was detected in 63 4 of water samples the human associated marker was rarely detected in sediment 19 2 and vegetation 22 8 and levels of hf183 were near the limit of detection in most samples table s4 fig 1 3 3 cross reactivity of hf183 dna extracted from five discrete water samples collected in january 2014 as well as the dna extracted from five white tailed deer fecal samples tested positive for hf183 using both conventional and qpcr hf183 amplicon sequences from water and deer fecal samples demonstrated 99 sequence identity with each other and 95 similarity with the 16s rrna sequence of bacteroides dorei a target of many human source mst assays bernhard and field 2000 haugland et al 2010 harwood et al 2014 fig 3 sequences from water and deer fecal samples were also closely related to the 16s rrna gene of an uncultured bacteroidales sequence from human feces genbank ef704867 1 source human gastrointestinal primers and probe sequences for the hf183 qpcr assay were 100 identical to the partial 16s rrna gene sequence of a representative deer fecal sample data not shown hf183 was not detected by qpcr in any of 12 australian rusa deer r timorensis fecal samples 3 4 influence of environmental variables on fib and mst marker levels mixed effects anova determined whether variations in fib or mst concentration could be attributed to and predicted by matrix or year month and site the best combination of variables for mixed effects anova based on aic values included year and month for ent gfd and hf183 fc had two competing models within 1 9 aic so the model with the least number of random effects i e years and months was chosen table 1 for both fc and ent the fixed effect i e matrix explained more variation than random effects i e years and months vegetation had significantly higher concentrations of fc and ent p value 0 0026 and 0 0001 followed by sediment p value 0 0001 and 0 0001 and water p value 0 0001 and 0 0001 on an untransformed scale fc concentrations were 129 and 68 times higher in vegetation and sediment respectively compared to water whereas ent concentrations were 40 and 12 times higher in vegetation and sediment respectively compared to water the variation in fc explained by environmental matrix corresponded to 53 9 marginal r2 and including the effect of years and months only increased the explained variation by 8 3 similarly the variation in ent explained by environmental matrix was 36 9 marginal r2 and including the effect of years and months only increased the explained variation by 8 2 table s4 random effect coefficients years and months suggested that concentrations of fc and ent were larger in 2013 intermediate in 2014 and smaller in 2015 no clear monthly patterns could be identified across years fig s1 in contrast to fib results random effects accounted for more variation than fixed effects for both gfd and hf183 sediment and vegetation had significantly greater concentrations of gfd than water p value 0 0001 on an untransformed scale gfd concentrations in sediment and vegetation were eight and three times higher than concentrations found in water respectively conversely sediment and vegetation had significantly lower concentrations of hf183 than water p value 0 0001 hf183 concentrations in sediment and vegetation were three times lower than concentrations found in water the variation in gfd explained by environmental matrix was 3 2 while the effect of years and months accounted for 43 1 of the variation for hf183 4 1 of the variation was explained by environmental matrix and the effect of years and months accounted for 50 3 table s4 gfd concentrations were larger in 2015 intermediate in 2014 and smaller in 2013 whereas hf183 concentrations were larger in 2014 intermediate in 2013 and smaller in 2015 no clear monthly patterns could be identified across years fig s1 similar explanatory conditional r2 and predictive power p2 indicated that chosen models were not over fitted and provided robust predictions fig 4 table s4 in accordance with our marginal and conditional r2 values for fc and ent matrix accounted for much variation in this dataset and environmental matrix clustered by type whereas the opposite trend was evident for gfd and hf183 fig 4 3 5 correlations between microbial variables we observed positive correlations between fc and ent tau 0 58 p value 2 2 10 16 fc and gfd tau 0 13 p value 0 0009 and ent and gfd tau 0 13 p value 0 0007 whereas negative correlations were observed between fc and hf183 tau 0 19 p value 3 51 10 6 and ent and hf183 tau 0 13 p value 0 001 4 discussion we examined a watershed managed for wildlife conservation to identify host types that contributed to elevated fib levels abundant populations of wild birds whose numbers peak in the winter months led us to include the gfd marker while the upstream presence of urban suburban development prompted the use of the human associated hf183 marker sediment and vegetation as well as water were sampled as previous studies suggested that these matrices can serve as reservoirs of fib in sub tropical waters badgley et al 2010 2011 chase et al 2012 however they have rarely been assessed for mst markers the water body we studied was placed on the florida department of environmental protection s 303 d list in 2010 because ambient water samples from site 2 consistently exceeded state regulatory guidelines for fc this designation was consistent with site 2 having the highest frequency of exceedance for fc throughout our study 2013 2015 fig 2 moreover january and march had the highest mean fc concentrations across years bird count data provided by the management organization data not shown coincided with high fc concentrations at site 2 bird count data at the same site also coincided with high concentrations of ent during january march and june migratory bird populations may therefore be the mechanism by which fib enter the water body similar trends have been observed in previous studies wright et al 2009 wu et al 2017 when we included environmental matrix in our models sediment and vegetation harbored fib concentrations one to two orders of magnitude greater than concentrations found in water for the entire sampling period fig 1 here we would like to note that diverse practices for expressing the concentration of bacteria in sediment soil particles with interstitial water and vegetation exist in the literature for example imamura et al 2011 compared fib in sand sediment and beach wrack with values normalized to dry weight this methodology cannot be applied to comparisons between solid substrates and water while we recognize that the comparison is not perfect we normalized water and sediment values essentially to wet weight as water weighs 100 g 100 ml this strategy allows a more realistic comparison than fib g dry weight of sediment which greatly elevates the calculations of fib in sediments compared to water this method can also be employed for vegetation which is relatively rarely sampled in comparable studies for publications in which this methodology is used see lee et al 2006 badgley et al 2011 and staley et al 2013b overall observing higher fib concentrations in sediment and vegetation than water was an expected trend and supports previous research that sediment and vegetation are reservoirs of fib in water bodies alm et al 2003 beversdorf et al 2007 coulliette and noble 2008 badgley et al 2011 byappanahalli et al 2012 accordingly the best fit mixed effects anova in our study confirms the predictive power of environmental matrix for fc and ent concentrations fig 4 table s5 thus if sediment and vegetation periodically contribute fib from older fecal sources to the water column sampling water alone may not give an accurate portrayal of current fecal pollution risk lee et al 2006 badgley et al 2010 fib in sediment and vegetation may provide false indications of recent contamination and could incur costly mitigation efforts in the absence of human health risk the gfd bird marker was consistently present at relatively high levels across all sites indicating the pervasive influence of bird feces on fib levels hf183 in contrast was detected sporadically at low levels because both mst markers had non detects that resulted in left censored data we substituted the lod divided by 2 for these values in both datasets the use of lod 2 for non detectable data points is valid according to standard practices and recommendations as long as it does not create a dataset that violates the assumptions of the statistical methodology employed usepa 2006 levine et al 2009 authority 2010 many recent publications have used this method for dealing with non detect observations e g chase et al 2015 imamura et al 2011 ravaliya et al 2014 and schriewer et al 2015 alternatives to substitution for left censored values have been advocated helsel 2005 2006 including bayesian and nonparametric analyses paulo et al 2005 kennedy 2010 wangkahad et al 2017 on the grounds that using a single substituted value for many data points can skew a dataset given that we had large datasets for fecal coliforms n 477 enterococci n 470 gfd n 398 and hf183 n 333 and all assumptions for anova and mix effects anova were met i e data normality and homoscedasticity normality of the residuals of the models no relationship between residuals and predicted values after data transformation i e log10 x 1 and independency of observations we chose to employ the lod 2 value for non detect samples the relatively weak persistence of hf183 in sediment zimmer faust et al 2017 offers one potential explanation of why the human associated marker was detected more frequently in water than sediment according to zimmer faust et al 2017 hf183 exhibited decay rates 2 5 times faster than culturable fib in sediment similar experiments to compare decay rates of fib and mst markers in vegetation have not been conducted but our results and those of previous studies suggest that a similar trend may hold e coli for example readily grow on shoreline wrack nevers et al 2016 and seaweeds enhance survival of e coli in beach sand quilliam et al 2014 enterococci have also been found to grow on vegetation badgley et al 2010 confirmation of cross reactivity of hf183 with white tailed deer feces in this water body supported our interpretations of the mst results as detection of hf183 may well have been due to contamination by deer feces rather than sewage consequently the hf183 marker was not a reliable indicator of human fecal contamination in this water body subsequent testing using alternative indicators of human fecal contamination the sewage associated pepper mild mottle virus pmmov rosario et al 2009 and human polyomaviruses hpyvs mcquaig et al 2009 yielded negative results across all environmental matrices years months and sites data not shown small differences between the dna sequences analyzed in this study offer an opportunity to design qpcr assays that could discriminate between deer and human sources of bacteroides an improved hf183 qpcr assay was recently developed by green et al 2014 who optimized the hf183 assay by pairing the same forward primer hf183 used in this study with a new reverse primer bacr287 this increased the target gene length from 80 bp this study to 126 bp hf183 bacr287 the sensitivity and specificity of the hf183 bacr287 assay was determined to be similar to or better than the hf183 bfdrev assay overall the detection of hf183 in florida white tailed deer feces but not in australian rusa deer feces indicates geographic variability of the marker and supports the importance of testing for mst marker specificity on local fecal samples fc and ent were positively correlated as expected additional positive correlations between both fib and gfd provided evidence that elevated levels of fib were likely due to birds and not humans by quantifying both fib and mst markers we identified birds as a major contributor of fecal pollution in this water body moreover fib were negatively correlated with hf183 concentrations which has also been found in a previous study sauer et al 2011 adding to the weight of evidence indicating that sewage was not an important contributor to fib in the watershed these results demonstrate the importance of a toolbox approach to assessing water quality and human health risk the data collected in this study allowed the management organization to meet its designated use as a wildlife conservation site natural source exclusion nse status was obtained and the water body was removed from the 303 d impaired water body list by the florida department of environmental protection if regulatory agencies adopt methods similar to those used in this study funds could more effectively be allocated towards maintaining and improving water quality instead of implementing unnecessary mitigation efforts for water bodies that do not pose a human health risk overall our results lend credence to the growing body of evidence that using culture based methods for fib alone provides an incomplete indication of microbial water quality and human health risk harwood et al 2005 schoen et al 2011 kirs et al 2017 while monitoring both fib and mst markers over a spatiotemporal scale is more informative of possible sources of fecal pollution harwood et al 2011 2017 mcquaig et al 2012 riedel et al 2015 5 conclusion low levels and intermittent detection of hf183 coupled with consistent detection of gfd supported our hypothesis that elevated fib levels were due to bird and not human fecal contamination cross reactivity of the human associated hf183 marker with local deer feces and a plentiful deer population explained the intermittent presence of hf183 in the water body predictive modeling poses a novel method for informing management organizations of likely factors influencing fecal pollution intensity and how to mitigate future fecal pollution events our study provides an example of how quantifying both fib and mst markers in different environmental matrices can improve water quality assessment and help tailor tmdl programs for impaired water bodies in the future

nanjing 210008 china dissolved organic matter dom in aquatic environment significantly influences the behavior and fate of heavy metals via binding complexation and thus changes the metal speciation however detailed interfacial processes and mechanisms are still unclear here differential absorbance and fluorescence spectra and two dimensional uv ftir heterospectral correlation analysis were applied to probe into the pb ii dom interaction at a wide range of ph and ionic strength is the absorbance of dom molecules under all conditions increased with metal addition while the different extents of absorbance variations along the wavelength range in the differential zero order and log transformed absorbance spectra indicated the site heterogeneity within the dom pool for metal binding spectral parameters namely differential fluorescent components 1 and 2 dfc1 and dfc2 and differential slopes of log transformed absorbance in the range of wavelength 350 400 nm dslope350 400 were found to be highly correlated with the total amounts of dom bound pb ii predicted by the nica donnan model while the differential absorbance spectra at 235 nm da235 was related to the extent of pb ii bound by carboxylic groups thus these parameters are an indicator or proxy for the in situ pb ii dom interaction extent aryl c h gave the fastest response to pb ii binding at lower ph and is e g ph 4 7 and is 0 01 m followed by carboxyl c o and polysaccharide c oh and then chromophoric groups at 265 nm cdom265 however the cdom265 bound to pb ii prior to aryl c h and polysaccharide c oh groups at higher ph and is 6 0 and 0 1 m respectively showing that the binding sequences were highly dependent on solution chemistry differential spectra combined with two dimensional uv ftir heterospectral correlation analysis can be used as a promising approach to elucidate metal dom interaction processes including site heterogeneity binding sensitivity and sequence at the functional group level graphical abstract image 1 keywords differential spectra dissolved organic matter heavy metals nica donnan model two dimensional heterospectral correlation analysis 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in natural waters and composed of multiple organic components and functional groups aiken et al 2011 xu and guo 2017 the formation of dom metal complexes reduces the free ion activity and the bioavailability of metal ions guo et al 2001 sánchez marín et al 2010 al reasi et al 2013 and regulates their fate and transportation in natural waters santschi et al 1997 soils shahid et al 2012 yu et al 2017 and plants microorganisms shahid et al 2012 chiasson gould et al 2014 the presence of dom in aquatic environment also affects the adsorption of metal ions onto organic inorganic interfaces wei et al 2011 komy et al 2014 due to the ubiquity and importance of dom in regulating the behavior and fate of metal ions knowledge on processes and mechanisms of metal dom interaction are indispensable as the polydisperse entity dom also contains light absorbing and emitting groups making optical spectroscopy an efficient tool to track its inherent property mcknight et al 2001 weishaar et al 2003 in addition fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem combined with parallel factor parafac analysis has been widely used to characterize natural dom stedmon and bro 2008 stedmon and bro 2008 xu et al 2013a however fluorophores represented only a small fraction e g 20 60 of dom pool gao et al 2015a hampering its broad application in metal dom characterization in comparison most functional groups in the total dom pool were chromophoric in natural waters zhou et al 2016 allowing the absorbance spectroscopy to possess a high potential in elucidating metal dom interactions however the original absorbance spectra usually suffered from the absence of conspicuous features in terms of variations in peak band intensities and locations gao et al 2015b yan et al 2015 recent studies have demonstrated that the original spectra can be processed using the differential approach e g differential zero order and log transformed spectra to enhance the spectral resolution and explore further the metal induced heterogeneities in binding sites among different chromophoric groups yan et al 2015 lu et al 2017 some spectral parameters obtained can even be used to quantify the extent of metal binding with dom yan et al 2013a despite its broad applications information on the binding dynamics e g response sequence of specific functional group which plays a key to understanding the interaction mechanisms remains limited based solely on the intensity analysis of differential spectra the optical approach should thus be combined with other chemical structural analysis such as fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy to obtain a deeper insight into the binding process even though the one dimensional ftir bands often overlapped due to the heterogeneity of dom recent studies showed that two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos can be used to resolve the overlapped peak problems and more importantly to reveal the sequences of structural variations of dom in response to external perturbations noda and ozaki 2004 as a result it has been previously used to explore the binding properties of metal ions with the specific molecular groups in dom pool via applications of selected spectral probes such as uv fluorescent ftir and others hur et al 2011 xu and jiang 2013 huang et al 2017 2018 moreover the 2d heterospectral correlation analysis combines two completely different types of spectra and can examine their co variations within a system yu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 thus correlation between complementary spectral signals can help better understand the response sequences of corresponding groups caused by the perturbation however to the best of our knowledge such an attempt in metal dom studies is still lacking in this study we combined the differential spectra with 2d heterospectral correlation analysis to probe in more details the binding properties of metal ions with dom humic acid was used as representative dom and its interaction with pb ii was performed under a wide range of ph and ionic strengths is at environmentally relevant conditions pb ii was one of most toxic metals and exhibited notable adverse effects on human especially the children lu et al 2017 non idea competitive adsorption nica donnan model was used to predict the metal binding of specific functional groups e g carboxylic and phenolic groups differential spectra including differential zero order and log transformed absorbance spectra as well as parafac derived components were applied to explore the detailed binding properties of chromophoric and fluorescent dom groups the parameters sensitive to metal addition were selected and correlated with the amounts of dom bound pb ii determined using the nica donnan model to quantify the metal dom interactions the 2d uv ftir heterospectral correlation analysis was used to assign the absorbance bands with specific ftir groups and to reveal their binding dynamics response sequence during metal titration results presented here are of vital importance for better understanding the metal dom interaction at a molecular level 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation suwannee river humic acid standard number 2s101h was purchased from international humic substances society and dissolved in ultrapure water followed by microfiltration 0 45 μm to remove any possible insoluble residual the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was determined to be 4 2 mg c l via the shimadzu toc l analyzer equipped with an asi l autosampler the zeta potential of dom samples at ph 6 0

metal dom interaction ph was maintained constant 4 7 or 6 0 via the addition of hclo4 and naoh the is of solutions 0 001 0 1 m was controlled by adding predetermined amounts of naclo4 the use of perchlorates in the adjustment of ph and is has been shown to have little influence on the measurement of dom absorbance spectra yan et al 2015 2 2 complexation of dom functional groups determined by the titration approach titration experiments were carried out by adding 0 1 m pb ii to a series of brown sealed vials containing 50 ml of dom solution using an automatic syringe ohno et al 2008 yamashita and jaffe 2008 no more than 50 μl of metal titrant was added making the pb ii concentrations in the final solutions ranging from 0 to 100 μm 0 2 5 3 75 5 7 5 10 15 20 25 37 5 50 75 and 100 μm respectively the ph was maintained at 4 7 or 6 0 under which pb2 remains the predominant species according to the pourbaix diagram of lead and the is with environmentally relevant concentrations ranged from 0 001 to 0 1 m no precipitate was observed during the whole titration which was also verified by the speciation analysis of visual minteq milne et al 2003 after metal addition the complexed samples were shaken immediately at 25 c for 24 h to ensure complexation equilibrium yamashita and jaffe 2008 titrated samples were then divided into two parts one for direct determination of absorbance and fluorescent spectra and the other for ftir analysis after freeze drying the modified stern volmer equation was applied to estimate the participation of dom functional groups in metal binding 1 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k m c m 1 f where f and f 0 are the measured dom abundance e g fluorescent component intensity herein at metal concentration c m and at the beginning of titration before metal addition respectively and f represents the fraction of dom which bound with metal finally k m is the conditional stability constant which can be obtained based on the slope and intercept of the linear equation hur and lee 2011 the nature and extent of pb ii binding with dom were modeled using the nica donnan approach in which metal binding accounts for both the specific and nonspecific interactions the specific interactions include binding with the operationally defined carboxylic and phenolic groups in dom while the nonspecific binding means the donnan electrostatic interactions detailed information on the binding constants is available in the visual minteq database milne et al 2003 2 3 absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy uv vis absorption spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer agilent 8453 over a wavelength range of 190 1000 nm with 1 nm increment since original zero order spectra were usually featureless the derived differential spectra including differential zero order and log transformed spectra yan et al 2013a 2015 gao et al 2015a b were adopted in this study the differential zero order and log transformed absorption spectra were calculated using the following equations 2 da λ a λ i a λ r e f 3 dlna λ lna λ i lna λ r e f where the da λ and dlna λ are differential zero order and log transformed absorbance spectra respectively in addition a λ i and a λ r e f are the spectral intensity at wavelength λ at any selected condition e g metal concentration ph and is and the reference absorbance intensity i e without metal addition respectively in this study the slopes of differential log transformed spectra within the 350 400 nm range were almost linearly related to wavelength and sensitive to metal addition their changes denoted as dslope350 400 were thus highlighted the slopes and differential slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra were calculated as follows 4 slope 350 400 d ln a λ dλ 350 400 nm 5 dslope 350 400 s 350 400 i s 350 400 r e f where s 350 400 i and s 350 400 r e f are the slopes of log transformed spectra at any selected condition and chosen reference spectra respectively fluorescence eem spectra were gathered with scanning emission em spectra from 240 to 600 nm at 2 nm increments by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 220 to 480 nm at 5 nm increments on a spectrofluorometer horiba fluoromax 4 the blank scans were performed at intervals of 10 analyses using ultrapure water data in two triangle areas corresponding to the rayleigh and raman scattering peaks were eliminated to acquire better mathematical results andersen and bro 2003 to enhance the spectral resolution parafac analysis was conducted in matlabr2013a mathworks natick ma using the domfluor tool box http www models life ku dk the residual analysis split half analysis and visual inspection were applied to determine the correct numbers of components stedmon and bro 2008 xu et al 2013b coble et al 2014 quinine sulfate standards were used to quantify fluorescent dom which converted the fluorescence intensities to ppb qse units murphy et al 2010 the differential fluorescent intensities dfc i were calculated as follows 6 dfc i c i c i r e f where c i and c i r e f were the intensities of parafac derived component i at any selected condition e g metal concentration ph and is and the reference component intensity i e without metal addition 2 4 ftir combined with 2d cos the freeze dried samples were mixed with kbr sample to kbr ratio of 1 100 w w and then compressed to form a disc ftir spectra were acquired with a nicolet nexus 870 ftir spectrometer by collecting 64 scans at a resolution of 2 cm 1 the 2d cos reveals the binding extents and sequences of dom groups with metal ions through the application of synchronous and asynchronous maps noda and ozaki 2004 the synchronous map is a symmetric spectrum with respect to the diagonal line which can denote the overall susceptibility of corresponding spectral region the asynchronous map in contrast reveals the sequential or successive changes of spectral intensities in response to external perturbation addition of pb ii was used as the external perturbation and thus a set of metal concentration dependent ftir spectra were obtained prior to 2d cos analysis the ftir spectra were normalized by the summed intensities from 400 to 4000 cm 1 and the noise components were removed by principal component analysis yu et al 2011 the reconstructed data matrix was then progressed using the 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 heterogeneities of pb ii binding with dom chromophores as revealed by differential absorption spectra the intensity of zero order absorption spectra decreased quasi exponentially along the wavelength range fig 1 a and changes in spectral intensities in response to pb ii addition were inconspicuous similar with those induced by other types of metal ions such as cu2 and cd2 yan et al 2013b gao et al 2015a to enhance the spectral resolution differential spectra were applied and normalized to doc to assure that the binding heterogeneity was solely related to the inherent properties of dom samples compared with the zero order absorption spectra the normalized differential spectra showed the existence of two predominant types of metal active chromophores with peak maxima at 235 and 387 nm respectively fig 1b the intensities of the two peaks both increased consistently in response to metal addition but with a greater extent for the former than the latter this indicated that dom chromophores with shorter wavelengths i e 235 nm showed a higher participation in metal binding than those with longer wavelength i e 387 nm since the zero order spectra were generally characterized with quasi exponential patterns their log transformed spectra can easily reveal the sensitivity of bands peaks associated with metal binding as expected the log transformed spectra showed a linear decline with increasing wavelength and more regions e g 260 nm 260 350 nm and 450 nm with somewhat different slopes can be observed fig 1c indicating an uneven distribution of active sites and functional groups within the dom pool for pb ii binding the results demonstrated evident priority of log transformed spectra in the manifestation of dom site specificity for metal binding to reveal the site heterogeneity in more details differential log transformed spectra were calculated and shown in fig 1d compared with the log transformed spectra the derived differential spectra clearly revealed major bands peaks located mainly at 235 nm 325 450 nm and 480 nm respectively addition of pb ii induced a slight intensity enhancement for all bands peaks but with different degrees also indicating the sensitivity heterogeneity of these chromophores in metal binding therefore although the metal induced zero order absorption spectra were featureless their differential spectra including differential zero order and log transformed spectra provides more information on binding heterogeneities of dom chromophores e g site distribution sensitivity and binding extent in terms of the influence of solution chemistry e g ph is on the chromophores the metal induced differential spectra had similar patterns figs s1 and s2 in the si indicating relative stability of dom groups in environmental conditions further analysis however revealed that intensity variations were positively related to ph but negatively related to is specifically the increased metal induced intensity had a greater degree at ph 6 0 than those at ph 4 7 for both differential zero order and log transformed spectra high ph induced the dissociation of dom molecules and the resultant exposure of functional groups e g carboxylic and phenolic chen et al 2014 which were responsible for the greater extent of intensity enhancement in contrast the presence of high is can cause the aggregation of dom molecules and the reduction of active binding sites thus resulting in a slight enhancement of spectral intensities lu et al 2017 3 2 binding properties of pb ii with fluorescent dom the initial eem spectra of dom samples showed two obvious humic like peaks with ex em 240 280 300 340 400 550 nm fig s3 in the si to explore the changes in fluorescent substances during pb ii addition parafac analysis was applied and two independent fluorescent dom components were identified fig s4 in the si component 1 c1 had its ex em maxima at 250 320 470 nm similar to peak a with terrestrial humic like source coble 1996 c2 with its characteristic ex em at 280 510 nm resembles coble s humic like peak m which would be associated with microbial metabolism coble 1996 during pb ii titration intensities of c1 and c2 under all conditions exhibited an initial rapid decrease followed by a gradual decline fig 2 demonstrating a process controlled by metal dom binding xu et al 2013a further analysis showed that the binding process was highly dependent on ph and is examined specifically the quenching efficiency exhibited a consistent decline with increasing is which can be ascribed to the completion for binding sites between electrolytes and pb ii xu et al 2016 on the other hand due to the exposure of fluorescent active groups at higher ph a greater quenching extent was reasonably observed at ph 6 0 rather than ph 4 7 the parameter f derived from the modified stern volmer equation table s1 in the si consolidated these factors the f values of c1 and c2 decreased with increasing is demonstrating the decline of available dom binding sites at higher electrolytes and consistent with previous observations yamashita and jaffe 2008 in addition positive relationships between the f values and ph were also consistent with the explanation on the exposure of dom binding sites at higher ph these results were also compatible with those derived from the differential absorbance spectra figs s1 and s2 in the si the logk m was another parameter in evaluating the ph and is dependent binding heterogeneities the logk m obtained in this study ranged between 4 38 and 5 15 which were comparable with those reported for other organic ligands yu et al 2012 huang et al 2018 specifically the logk m of c1 and c2 at ph 6 0 were higher than those at ph 4 7 again testifying the exposure of dom binding sites at higher ph as for the influence of is the logk m values did not showed obvious patterns among different is treatments besides examining metal dom binding properties fluorescence spectroscopy can also be used to investigate the binding mechanism binding of organic ligands with electrolyte cations and heavy metals was previously reported to be mainly ascribed to electrostatic neutralization and chemical complexation respectively sheng et al 2013 the zeta potential of the complexes should thus remain constant with heavy metal addition but show less negative for electrolyte binding however a dynamic change was observed in that the surface potential of complexes decreased during the initial pb ii titration i e 15 μm of addition fig s5 in the si indicating a chemical complexation mechanism as pb ii titration continued the zeta potential became less negative which was in accordance with the explanation of electrostatic neutralization thus compared to previous studies sheng et al 2013 the mechanism for pb ii dom interaction was found to be highly related to metal concentration in that chemical complexation dominated the interaction at low pb ii concentration while the electrostatic neutralization became the main contributor with high pb ii concentration 3 3 relationships between differential spectral parameters and pb ii dom interaction 3 3 1 dslope350 400 and da235 as stated above the slopes of differential log transformed spectra within the 350 400 nm range and the intensities of differential order zero spectra at 235 nm were most sensitive to metal addition the parameters of dslope350 400 and da235 were thus selected to examine the dom pb ii interactions it was previously shown that the band 260 nm was more strongly associated with the deprotonation of operationally defined dom carboxylic groups while those in the range of 300 400 nm reflected the engagement of both phenolic and carboxylic groups dryer et al 2008 lu et al 2017 to reveal the significance of the selected parameters the dslope350 400 values of dom samples at each ph and is were plotted against the concentrations of dom bound pb ii estimated by the nica donnan model as shown in fig 3 changes in parameters dslope350 400 were generally sensitive to is and ph for example at each is condition i e 0 001 0 1 m the values of dslope350 400 increased with the amounts of dom bound pb ii irrespective of ph r2 0 91 0 98 in addition the values of da235 were found to be highly correlated with the amounts of pb ii bound by carboxylic groups regardless of the different ph and is the results indicated that parameters dslope350 400 and da235 can be used as indicators or proxies to characterize the amounts of dom bound pb ii and the extents of pb ii bound by carboxylic groups respectively 3 3 2 parafac derived fluorescent component parameters fig 3c d shows the relationships between the concentration of pb ii bound by dom and differential fluorescent components it was obvious that the amounts of dom bound metals were highly correlated with the normalized dfc1 r 2 0 90 and dfc2 r 2 0 85 irrespective of ph and is the correlation between pb ii dom interaction and dfc1 dfc2 were similar with those of dslope350 400 and da235 indicating that these chromophores and fluorescent components may have similar molecular structure and complexation properties for pb ii binding to validate this hypothesis the chromophoric spectral parameters were plotted against dfc1 and dfc2 at various conditions fig 4 it was shown that the values of dslope350 400 and da235 at each selected condition were highly correlated with those of dfc1 r 2 0 86 and dfc2 r 2 0 93 suggesting that these parameters indeed reflect the occurrence of largely the same phenomena the results indicated that the parameters dslope350 400 da235 dfc1 and dfc2 can provide important information on the involvement of specific carboxylic and phenolic functional groups in metal complexation they can thus be considered as sensitive and in situ surrogate parameters for nica donnan model to quantify the metal dom interaction 3 4 two dimension correlation spectroscopy combined with uv and ftir probes in order to explore the binding dynamics of dom groups in response to pb ii addition 2d cos was applied in this study detailed information on the location and properties of auto peaks and cross peaks in synchronous and asynchronous maps can be found in our previous studies xu and jiang 2013 xu et al 2016 based on the 2d uv cos analysis the synchronous maps of metal dom complexes in different ph and is treatments were similar with two major auto peaks observed at 235 nm and 265 nm respectively fig s6 in the si the intensities of peak 235 nm were always higher than those of peak 265 nm indicating that chromophoric dom at 235 nm cdom235 was more sensitive to pb ii binding than cdom265 hur and lee 2011 the results were consistent with those derived from the differential absorbance spectra fig 1b compared to synchronous maps there existed a positive cross peak λ1 λ2 265 235 nm above the diagonal line in the asynchronous maps according to noda s rule noda and ozaki 2004 the sequential order of chromophores binding with pb ii was cdom265 cdom235 which indicated that cdom265 was always interacted with pb ii prior to cdom235 except for the treatment of ph 4 7 and is 0 01 m the precise reason for the exception was still unclear but should be related to different spatial and structural configurations of dom samples e g higher molecular weights incompletely extending chains and less group exposure at low ph compared to uv absorption spectra ftir can be used to reveal the presence of specific functional groups yan et al 2016 the synchronous maps of 2d ftir cos showed that the most sensitive group with metal binding was polysaccharide c oh 1080 cm 1 followed by aromatic c h 840 cm 1 and amide c o 1620 cm 1 fig s7 in the si cross peaks in the asynchronous maps however exhibited different distribution patterns under various ph and is conditions specifically at the is of 0 01 m the signal of cross peak λ1 λ2 1080 840 cm 1 was negative at ph 4 7 but positive and ph 6 0 this indicated that the binding sequence of dom groups to pb ii was aromatic c h polysaccharide c oh at ph 4 7 but polysaccharide c oh aromatic c h at ph 6 0 the heterogeneities in binding sequences would be due to the deprotonation of surface functional groups especially aromatic carbon at higher ph yang et al 2018 however when is increased to 0 1 m clear negative cross peaks λ1 λ2 1080 840 cm 1 were observed irrespective of phs indicating a preferential binding of aromatic carbon to polysaccharide carbon high is can enhance the fraction of high molecular weight dom which was generally characterized with high aromaticity phong and hur 2018 thus accounting for the preferential binding of aromatic carbon 3 5 two dimensional uv ftir heterospectral correlation spectroscopy the 2d heterospectral uv ftir correlation analysis was used to assign the uv and ftir bands and further to examine their co variations as shown in fig 5 and fig s8 when is was 0 01 m ftir bands 1620 1080 and 840 cm 1 at each ph were positively correlated with the uv peak of 235 nm but negatively related to those of 265 nm the results indicated that cdom235 consisted mainly of carboxyl c o polysaccharide c oh and aryl c h functional groups in the asynchronous maps the ftir bands were positively and negatively correlated with cdom235 at ph 4 7 and 6 0 respectively in addition the ftir bands were found to correlate negatively with cdom265 in each ph treatment base on the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2004 the binding sequences of these functional groups to pb ii were 840 cm 1 1620 cm 1 1080 cm 1 265 nm 235 nm for ph 4 7 and 265 nm 235 nm 1080 cm 1 1620 cm 1 840 cm 1 for ph 6 0 the results demonstrated that at lower ph and is e g ph 4 7 and is 0 01 m as pb ii was added aryl c h and carboxyl c o groups gave the fastest response followed by polysaccharide c oh and cdom265 however when ph was raised to 6 0 an opposite binding sequence was found in that the cdom265 group was firstly bound followed by the polysaccharide c oh and carboxyl c o and then aryl c h groups when the is increased to 0 1 m the synchronous maps showed that the ftir bands 1080 and 1620 cm 1 were positively correlated with the uv bands regardless of phs in addition a negative λ1 λ1 785 cm 1 260 nm and positive λ1 λ1 785 cm 1 230 nm cross peak was observed at ph 4 7 and ph 6 0 respectively the results indicated that carboxyl c o polysaccharide c oh and aryl c h groups were the primary functional units of the cdom at ph 6 0 while at ph 4 7 the cdom contained mainly of carboxyl c o and polysaccharide c oh groups as for the asynchronous maps two negative cross peaks λ1 λ2 1080 cm 1 235 nm 850 cm 1 235 nm were always observed in the two ph treatments according to the noda s rule the binding sequences of dom functional groups were 840 cm 1 265 nm 235 nm 1080 cm 1 for ph 4 7 and 265 nm 235 nm 840 cm 1 1080 cm 1 for ph 6 0 this indicated that at low ph and high is e g ph 4 7 and is 0 1 m pb ii was firstly interacted with aryl c h followed by cdom265 and then polysaccharide c oh groups however when ph increased to 6 0 cdom265 gave the first response to pb ii binding and then aryl c h and polysaccharide c oh groups overall the binding dynamics of dom groups in response to pb ii addition were regulated by both ph and is 3 6 significance of this study due to the important role of dom in manipulating the chemical speciation and toxicity of heavy metals metal dom interactions have received increasing attention many spectral techniques and models including eem parafac xu et al 2013a differential spectra yan et al 2015 2d cos coupled with synchronous fluorescence hur and lee 2011 ftir chen et al 2014 huang et al 2018 and nmr yu et al 2011 probes and nica donnan model yan et al 2013a have recently been applied to characterize the metal dom interaction although the differential spectra combined with nica donna model is a powerful approach to examine the nature and extent of metal dom interactions it suffered from ambiguities in the structural assignment for example it is not previously clear as to what was the specific functional group having a characteristic wavelength of 200 300 nm the 2d uv ftir heterospectral correlation spectroscopy however can be used to assign chromophoric dom with specific ftir groups and more importantly clarify the relationship between the two techniques combining the two complementary techniques as shown for the first attempt in this study can become a powerful approach for elucidating the correlation and sequential orders of different functional groups in response to metal binding based on the application of differential approach and nica donnan model the close correlations between concentrations of dom bound pb ii and dslope350 400 da235 dfc1 and dfc2 r 2 0 85 suggested that these parameters can be used to quantify the in situ metal dom interaction in addition the 2d heterospectral correlation analysis can integrate two different spectral probes by applying 2d uv ftir heterospectral correlation spectroscopy our results for the first time revealed the pb ii binding with chromophoric and non chromophoric substances simultaneously and identified their ph and is dependent binding sequences in environmentally relevant conditions our new results on the extent and dynamics of metal binding with dom should contribute to the better understanding of the organic inorganic interfacial interaction and thus the ecological role and environmental fate of metal dom complex in natural and engineered aquatic systems 4 conclusion differential spectra combined with 2d uv ftir heterospectral correlation analysis were applied for the first time to probe the process and mechanism of pb ii binding with dom although the zero order absorption spectra were featureless differential spectra including differential zero order and log transformed spectra showed an uneven distribution of active sites and functional groups within dom pool for pb ii binding application of differential spectra also revealed the heterogeneities in binding extent among different chromophoric and fluorescent groups in addition parameters dslope350 400 dfc1 and dfc2 were found to be significantly correlated with the concentrations of dom bound pb ii while those of da235 were related to the amounts of pb ii bound by carboxylic groups the 2d uv ftir heterospectral correlation analysis further identified the ph and is dependent dom pb ii binding heterogeneities in sequential orders of dom functional groups in response to metal addition the combined techniques should be a promising approach to probe into the

nanjing 210008 china dissolved organic matter dom in aquatic environment significantly influences the behavior and fate of heavy metals via binding complexation and thus changes the metal speciation however detailed interfacial processes and mechanisms are still unclear here differential absorbance and fluorescence spectra and two dimensional uv ftir heterospectral correlation analysis were applied to probe into the pb ii dom interaction at a wide range of ph and ionic strength is the absorbance of dom molecules under all conditions increased with metal addition while the different extents of absorbance variations along the wavelength range in the differential zero order and log transformed absorbance spectra indicated the site heterogeneity within the dom pool for metal binding spectral parameters namely differential fluorescent components 1 and 2 dfc1 and dfc2 and differential slopes of log transformed absorbance in the range of wavelength 350 400 nm dslope350 400 were found to be highly correlated with the total amounts of dom bound pb ii predicted by the nica donnan model while the differential absorbance spectra at 235 nm da235 was related to the extent of pb ii bound by carboxylic groups thus these parameters are an indicator or proxy for the in situ pb ii dom interaction extent aryl c h gave the fastest response to pb ii binding at lower ph and is e g ph 4 7 and is 0 01 m followed by carboxyl c o and polysaccharide c oh and then chromophoric groups at 265 nm cdom265 however the cdom265 bound to pb ii prior to aryl c h and polysaccharide c oh groups at higher ph and is 6 0 and 0 1 m respectively showing that the binding sequences were highly dependent on solution chemistry differential spectra combined with two dimensional uv ftir heterospectral correlation analysis can be used as a promising approach to elucidate metal dom interaction processes including site heterogeneity binding sensitivity and sequence at the functional group level graphical abstract image 1 keywords differential spectra dissolved organic matter heavy metals nica donnan model two dimensional heterospectral correlation analysis 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in natural waters and composed of multiple organic components and functional groups aiken et al 2011 xu and guo 2017 the formation of dom metal complexes reduces the free ion activity and the bioavailability of metal ions guo et al 2001 sánchez marín et al 2010 al reasi et al 2013 and regulates their fate and transportation in natural waters santschi et al 1997 soils shahid et al 2012 yu et al 2017 and plants microorganisms shahid et al 2012 chiasson gould et al 2014 the presence of dom in aquatic environment also affects the adsorption of metal ions onto organic inorganic interfaces wei et al 2011 komy et al 2014 due to the ubiquity and importance of dom in regulating the behavior and fate of metal ions knowledge on processes and mechanisms of metal dom interaction are indispensable as the polydisperse entity dom also contains light absorbing and emitting groups making optical spectroscopy an efficient tool to track its inherent property mcknight et al 2001 weishaar et al 2003 in addition fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem combined with parallel factor parafac analysis has been widely used to characterize natural dom stedmon and bro 2008 stedmon and bro 2008 xu et al 2013a however fluorophores represented only a small fraction e g 20 60 of dom pool gao et al 2015a hampering its broad application in metal dom characterization in comparison most functional groups in the total dom pool were chromophoric in natural waters zhou et al 2016 allowing the absorbance spectroscopy to possess a high potential in elucidating metal dom interactions however the original absorbance spectra usually suffered from the absence of conspicuous features in terms of variations in peak band intensities and locations gao et al 2015b yan et al 2015 recent studies have demonstrated that the original spectra can be processed using the differential approach e g differential zero order and log transformed spectra to enhance the spectral resolution and explore further the metal induced heterogeneities in binding sites among different chromophoric groups yan et al 2015 lu et al 2017 some spectral parameters obtained can even be used to quantify the extent of metal binding with dom yan et al 2013a despite its broad applications information on the binding dynamics e g response sequence of specific functional group which plays a key to understanding the interaction mechanisms remains limited based solely on the intensity analysis of differential spectra the optical approach should thus be combined with other chemical structural analysis such as fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy to obtain a deeper insight into the binding process even though the one dimensional ftir bands often overlapped due to the heterogeneity of dom recent studies showed that two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos can be used to resolve the overlapped peak problems and more importantly to reveal the sequences of structural variations of dom in response to external perturbations noda and ozaki 2004 as a result it has been previously used to explore the binding properties of metal ions with the specific molecular groups in dom pool via applications of selected spectral probes such as uv fluorescent ftir and others hur et al 2011 xu and jiang 2013 huang et al 2017 2018 moreover the 2d heterospectral correlation analysis combines two completely different types of spectra and can examine their co variations within a system yu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 thus correlation between complementary spectral signals can help better understand the response sequences of corresponding groups caused by the perturbation however to the best of our knowledge such an attempt in metal dom studies is still lacking in this study we combined the differential spectra with 2d heterospectral correlation analysis to probe in more details the binding properties of metal ions with dom humic acid was used as representative dom and its interaction with pb ii was performed under a wide range of ph and ionic strengths is at environmentally relevant conditions pb ii was one of most toxic metals and exhibited notable adverse effects on human especially the children lu et al 2017 non idea competitive adsorption nica donnan model was used to predict the metal binding of specific functional groups e g carboxylic and phenolic groups differential spectra including differential zero order and log transformed absorbance spectra as well as parafac derived components were applied to explore the detailed binding properties of chromophoric and fluorescent dom groups the parameters sensitive to metal addition were selected and correlated with the amounts of dom bound pb ii determined using the nica donnan model to quantify the metal dom interactions the 2d uv ftir heterospectral correlation analysis was used to assign the absorbance bands with specific ftir groups and to reveal their binding dynamics response sequence during metal titration results presented here are of vital importance for better understanding the metal dom interaction at a molecular level 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation suwannee river humic acid standard number 2s101h was purchased from international humic substances society and dissolved in ultrapure water followed by microfiltration 0 45 μm to remove any possible insoluble residual the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was determined to be 4 2 mg c l via the shimadzu toc l analyzer equipped with an asi l autosampler the zeta potential of dom samples at ph 6 0

metal dom interaction ph was maintained constant 4 7 or 6 0 via the addition of hclo4 and naoh the is of solutions 0 001 0 1 m was controlled by adding predetermined amounts of naclo4 the use of perchlorates in the adjustment of ph and is has been shown to have little influence on the measurement of dom absorbance spectra yan et al 2015 2 2 complexation of dom functional groups determined by the titration approach titration experiments were carried out by adding 0 1 m pb ii to a series of brown sealed vials containing 50 ml of dom solution using an automatic syringe ohno et al 2008 yamashita and jaffe 2008 no more than 50 μl of metal titrant was added making the pb ii concentrations in the final solutions ranging from 0 to 100 μm 0 2 5 3 75 5 7 5 10 15 20 25 37 5 50 75 and 100 μm respectively the ph was maintained at 4 7 or 6 0 under which pb2 remains the predominant species according to the pourbaix diagram of lead and the is with environmentally relevant concentrations ranged from 0 001 to 0 1 m no precipitate was observed during the whole titration which was also verified by the speciation analysis of visual minteq milne et al 2003 after metal addition the complexed samples were shaken immediately at 25 c for 24 h to ensure complexation equilibrium yamashita and jaffe 2008 titrated samples were then divided into two parts one for direct determination of absorbance and fluorescent spectra and the other for ftir analysis after freeze drying the modified stern volmer equation was applied to estimate the participation of dom functional groups in metal binding 1 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k m c m 1 f where f and f 0 are the measured dom abundance e g fluorescent component intensity herein at metal concentration c m and at the beginning of titration before metal addition respectively and f represents the fraction of dom which bound with metal finally k m is the conditional stability constant which can be obtained based on the slope and intercept of the linear equation hur and lee 2011 the nature and extent of pb ii binding with dom were modeled using the nica donnan approach in which metal binding accounts for both the specific and nonspecific interactions the specific interactions include binding with the operationally defined carboxylic and phenolic groups in dom while the nonspecific binding means the donnan electrostatic interactions detailed information on the binding constants is available in the visual minteq database milne et al 2003 2 3 absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy uv vis absorption spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer agilent 8453 over a wavelength range of 190 1000 nm with 1 nm increment since original zero order spectra were usually featureless the derived differential spectra including differential zero order and log transformed spectra yan et al 2013a 2015 gao et al 2015a b were adopted in this study the differential zero order and log transformed absorption spectra were calculated using the following equations 2 da λ a λ i a λ r e f 3 dlna λ lna λ i lna λ r e f where the da λ and dlna λ are differential zero order and log transformed absorbance spectra respectively in addition a λ i and a λ r e f are the spectral intensity at wavelength λ at any selected condition e g metal concentration ph and is and the reference absorbance intensity i e without metal addition respectively in this study the slopes of differential log transformed spectra within the 350 400 nm range were almost linearly related to wavelength and sensitive to metal addition their changes denoted as dslope350 400 were thus highlighted the slopes and differential slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra were calculated as follows 4 slope 350 400 d ln a λ dλ 350 400 nm 5 dslope 350 400 s 350 400 i s 350 400 r e f where s 350 400 i and s 350 400 r e f are the slopes of log transformed spectra at any selected condition and chosen reference spectra respectively fluorescence eem spectra were gathered with scanning emission em spectra from 240 to 600 nm at 2 nm increments by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 220 to 480 nm at 5 nm increments on a spectrofluorometer horiba fluoromax 4 the blank scans were performed at intervals of 10 analyses using ultrapure water data in two triangle areas corresponding to the rayleigh and raman scattering peaks were eliminated to acquire better mathematical results andersen and bro 2003 to enhance the spectral resolution parafac analysis was conducted in matlabr2013a mathworks natick ma using the domfluor tool box http www models life ku dk the residual analysis split half analysis and visual inspection were applied to determine the correct numbers of components stedmon and bro 2008 xu et al 2013b coble et al 2014 quinine sulfate standards were used to quantify fluorescent dom which converted the fluorescence intensities to ppb qse units murphy et al 2010 the differential fluorescent intensities dfc i were calculated as follows 6 dfc i c i c i r e f where c i and c i r e f were the intensities of parafac derived component i at any selected condition e g metal concentration ph and is and the reference component intensity i e without metal addition 2 4 ftir combined with 2d cos the freeze dried samples were mixed with kbr sample to kbr ratio of 1 100 w w and then compressed to form a disc ftir spectra were acquired with a nicolet nexus 870 ftir spectrometer by collecting 64 scans at a resolution of 2 cm 1 the 2d cos reveals the binding extents and sequences of dom groups with metal ions through the application of synchronous and asynchronous maps noda and ozaki 2004 the synchronous map is a symmetric spectrum with respect to the diagonal line which can denote the overall susceptibility of corresponding spectral region the asynchronous map in contrast reveals the sequential or successive changes of spectral intensities in response to external perturbation addition of pb ii was used as the external perturbation and thus a set of metal concentration dependent ftir spectra were obtained prior to 2d cos analysis the ftir spectra were normalized by the summed intensities from 400 to 4000 cm 1 and the noise components were removed by principal component analysis yu et al 2011 the reconstructed data matrix was then progressed using the 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 heterogeneities of pb ii binding with dom chromophores as revealed by differential absorption spectra the intensity of zero order absorption spectra decreased quasi exponentially along the wavelength range fig 1 a and changes in spectral intensities in response to pb ii addition were inconspicuous similar with those induced by other types of metal ions such as cu2 and cd2 yan et al 2013b gao et al 2015a to enhance the spectral resolution differential spectra were applied and normalized to doc to assure that the binding heterogeneity was solely related to the inherent properties of dom samples compared with the zero order absorption spectra the normalized differential spectra showed the existence of two predominant types of metal active chromophores with peak maxima at 235 and 387 nm respectively fig 1b the intensities of the two peaks both increased consistently in response to metal addition but with a greater extent for the former than the latter this indicated that dom chromophores with shorter wavelengths i e 235 nm showed a higher participation in metal binding than those with longer wavelength i e 387 nm since the zero order spectra were generally characterized with quasi exponential patterns their log transformed spectra can easily reveal the sensitivity of bands peaks associated with metal binding as expected the log transformed spectra showed a linear decline with increasing wavelength and more regions e g 260 nm 260 350 nm and 450 nm with somewhat different slopes can be observed fig 1c indicating an uneven distribution of active sites and functional groups within the dom pool for pb ii binding the results demonstrated evident priority of log transformed spectra in the manifestation of dom site specificity for metal binding to reveal the site heterogeneity in more details differential log transformed spectra were calculated and shown in fig 1d compared with the log transformed spectra the derived differential spectra clearly revealed major bands peaks located mainly at 235 nm 325 450 nm and 480 nm respectively addition of pb ii induced a slight intensity enhancement for all bands peaks but with different degrees also indicating the sensitivity heterogeneity of these chromophores in metal binding therefore although the metal induced zero order absorption spectra were featureless their differential spectra including differential zero order and log transformed spectra provides more information on binding heterogeneities of dom chromophores e g site distribution sensitivity and binding extent in terms of the influence of solution chemistry e g ph is on the chromophores the metal induced differential spectra had similar patterns figs s1 and s2 in the si indicating relative stability of dom groups in environmental conditions further analysis however revealed that intensity variations were positively related to ph but negatively related to is specifically the increased metal induced intensity had a greater degree at ph 6 0 than those at ph 4 7 for both differential zero order and log transformed spectra high ph induced the dissociation of dom molecules and the resultant exposure of functional groups e g carboxylic and phenolic chen et al 2014 which were responsible for the greater extent of intensity enhancement in contrast the presence of high is can cause the aggregation of dom molecules and the reduction of active binding sites thus resulting in a slight enhancement of spectral intensities lu et al 2017 3 2 binding properties of pb ii with fluorescent dom the initial eem spectra of dom samples showed two obvious humic like peaks with ex em 240 280 300 340 400 550 nm fig s3 in the si to explore the changes in fluorescent substances during pb ii addition parafac analysis was applied and two independent fluorescent dom components were identified fig s4 in the si component 1 c1 had its ex em maxima at 250 320 470 nm similar to peak a with terrestrial humic like source coble 1996 c2 with its characteristic ex em at 280 510 nm resembles coble s humic like peak m which would be associated with microbial metabolism coble 1996 during pb ii titration intensities of c1 and c2 under all conditions exhibited an initial rapid decrease followed by a gradual decline fig 2 demonstrating a process controlled by metal dom binding xu et al 2013a further analysis showed that the binding process was highly dependent on ph and is examined specifically the quenching efficiency exhibited a consistent decline with increasing is which can be ascribed to the completion for binding sites between electrolytes and pb ii xu et al 2016 on the other hand due to the exposure of fluorescent active groups at higher ph a greater quenching extent was reasonably observed at ph 6 0 rather than ph 4 7 the parameter f derived from the modified stern volmer equation table s1 in the si consolidated these factors the f values of c1 and c2 decreased with increasing is demonstrating the decline of available dom binding sites at higher electrolytes and consistent with previous observations yamashita and jaffe 2008 in addition positive relationships between the f values and ph were also consistent with the explanation on the exposure of dom binding sites at higher ph these results were also compatible with those derived from the differential absorbance spectra figs s1 and s2 in the si the logk m was another parameter in evaluating the ph and is dependent binding heterogeneities the logk m obtained in this study ranged between 4 38 and 5 15 which were comparable with those reported for other organic ligands yu et al 2012 huang et al 2018 specifically the logk m of c1 and c2 at ph 6 0 were higher than those at ph 4 7 again testifying the exposure of dom binding sites at higher ph as for the influence of is the logk m values did not showed obvious patterns among different is treatments besides examining metal dom binding properties fluorescence spectroscopy can also be used to investigate the binding mechanism binding of organic ligands with electrolyte cations and heavy metals was previously reported to be mainly ascribed to electrostatic neutralization and chemical complexation respectively sheng et al 2013 the zeta potential of the complexes should thus remain constant with heavy metal addition but show less negative for electrolyte binding however a dynamic change was observed in that the surface potential of complexes decreased during the initial pb ii titration i e 15 μm of addition fig s5 in the si indicating a chemical complexation mechanism as pb ii titration continued the zeta potential became less negative which was in accordance with the explanation of electrostatic neutralization thus compared to previous studies sheng et al 2013 the mechanism for pb ii dom interaction was found to be highly related to metal concentration in that chemical complexation dominated the interaction at low pb ii concentration while the electrostatic neutralization became the main contributor with high pb ii concentration 3 3 relationships between differential spectral parameters and pb ii dom interaction 3 3 1 dslope350 400 and da235 as stated above the slopes of differential log transformed spectra within the 350 400 nm range and the intensities of differential order zero spectra at 235 nm were most sensitive to metal addition the parameters of dslope350 400 and da235 were thus selected to examine the dom pb ii interactions it was previously shown that the band 260 nm was more strongly associated with the deprotonation of operationally defined dom carboxylic groups while those in the range of 300 400 nm reflected the engagement of both phenolic and carboxylic groups dryer et al 2008 lu et al 2017 to reveal the significance of the selected parameters the dslope350 400 values of dom samples at each ph and is were plotted against the concentrations of dom bound pb ii estimated by the nica donnan model as shown in fig 3 changes in parameters dslope350 400 were generally sensitive to is and ph for example at each is condition i e 0 001 0 1 m the values of dslope350 400 increased with the amounts of dom bound pb ii irrespective of ph r2 0 91 0 98 in addition the values of da235 were found to be highly correlated with the amounts of pb ii bound by carboxylic groups regardless of the different ph and is the results indicated that parameters dslope350 400 and da235 can be used as indicators or proxies to characterize the amounts of dom bound pb ii and the extents of pb ii bound by carboxylic groups respectively 3 3 2 parafac derived fluorescent component parameters fig 3c d shows the relationships between the concentration of pb ii bound by dom and differential fluorescent components it was obvious that the amounts of dom bound metals were highly correlated with the normalized dfc1 r 2 0 90 and dfc2 r 2 0 85 irrespective of ph and is the correlation between pb ii dom interaction and dfc1 dfc2 were similar with those of dslope350 400 and da235 indicating that these chromophores and fluorescent components may have similar molecular structure and complexation properties for pb ii binding to validate this hypothesis the chromophoric spectral parameters were plotted against dfc1 and dfc2 at various conditions fig 4 it was shown that the values of dslope350 400 and da235 at each selected condition were highly correlated with those of dfc1 r 2 0 86 and dfc2 r 2 0 93 suggesting that these parameters indeed reflect the occurrence of largely the same phenomena the results indicated that the parameters dslope350 400 da235 dfc1 and dfc2 can provide important information on the involvement of specific carboxylic and phenolic functional groups in metal complexation they can thus be considered as sensitive and in situ surrogate parameters for nica donnan model to quantify the metal dom interaction 3 4 two dimension correlation spectroscopy combined with uv and ftir probes in order to explore the binding dynamics of dom groups in response to pb ii addition 2d cos was applied in this study detailed information on the location and properties of auto peaks and cross peaks in synchronous and asynchronous maps can be found in our previous studies xu and jiang 2013 xu et al 2016 based on the 2d uv cos analysis the synchronous maps of metal dom complexes in different ph and is treatments were similar with two major auto peaks observed at 235 nm and 265 nm respectively fig s6 in the si the intensities of peak 235 nm were always higher than those of peak 265 nm indicating that chromophoric dom at 235 nm cdom235 was more sensitive to pb ii binding than cdom265 hur and lee 2011 the results were consistent with those derived from the differential absorbance spectra fig 1b compared to synchronous maps there existed a positive cross peak λ1 λ2 265 235 nm above the diagonal line in the asynchronous maps according to noda s rule noda and ozaki 2004 the sequential order of chromophores binding with pb ii was cdom265 cdom235 which indicated that cdom265 was always interacted with pb ii prior to cdom235 except for the treatment of ph 4 7 and is 0 01 m the precise reason for the exception was still unclear but should be related to different spatial and structural configurations of dom samples e g higher molecular weights incompletely extending chains and less group exposure at low ph compared to uv absorption spectra ftir can be used to reveal the presence of specific functional groups yan et al 2016 the synchronous maps of 2d ftir cos showed that the most sensitive group with metal binding was polysaccharide c oh 1080 cm 1 followed by aromatic c h 840 cm 1 and amide c o 1620 cm 1 fig s7 in the si cross peaks in the asynchronous maps however exhibited different distribution patterns under various ph and is conditions specifically at the is of 0 01 m the signal of cross peak λ1 λ2 1080 840 cm 1 was negative at ph 4 7 but positive and ph 6 0 this indicated that the binding sequence of dom groups to pb ii was aromatic c h polysaccharide c oh at ph 4 7 but polysaccharide c oh aromatic c h at ph 6 0 the heterogeneities in binding sequences would be due to the deprotonation of surface functional groups especially aromatic carbon at higher ph yang et al 2018 however when is increased to 0 1 m clear negative cross peaks λ1 λ2 1080 840 cm 1 were observed irrespective of phs indicating a preferential binding of aromatic carbon to polysaccharide carbon high is can enhance the fraction of high molecular weight dom which was generally characterized with high aromaticity phong and hur 2018 thus accounting for the preferential binding of aromatic carbon 3 5 two dimensional uv ftir heterospectral correlation spectroscopy the 2d heterospectral uv ftir correlation analysis was used to assign the uv and ftir bands and further to examine their co variations as shown in fig 5 and fig s8 when is was 0 01 m ftir bands 1620 1080 and 840 cm 1 at each ph were positively correlated with the uv peak of 235 nm but negatively related to those of 265 nm the results indicated that cdom235 consisted mainly of carboxyl c o polysaccharide c oh and aryl c h functional groups in the asynchronous maps the ftir bands were positively and negatively correlated with cdom235 at ph 4 7 and 6 0 respectively in addition the ftir bands were found to correlate negatively with cdom265 in each ph treatment base on the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2004 the binding sequences of these functional groups to pb ii were 840 cm 1 1620 cm 1 1080 cm 1 265 nm 235 nm for ph 4 7 and 265 nm 235 nm 1080 cm 1 1620 cm 1 840 cm 1 for ph 6 0 the results demonstrated that at lower ph and is e g ph 4 7 and is 0 01 m as pb ii was added aryl c h and carboxyl c o groups gave the fastest response followed by polysaccharide c oh and cdom265 however when ph was raised to 6 0 an opposite binding sequence was found in that the cdom265 group was firstly bound followed by the polysaccharide c oh and carboxyl c o and then aryl c h groups when the is increased to 0 1 m the synchronous maps showed that the ftir bands 1080 and 1620 cm 1 were positively correlated with the uv bands regardless of phs in addition a negative λ1 λ1 785 cm 1 260 nm and positive λ1 λ1 785 cm 1 230 nm cross peak was observed at ph 4 7 and ph 6 0 respectively the results indicated that carboxyl c o polysaccharide c oh and aryl c h groups were the primary functional units of the cdom at ph 6 0 while at ph 4 7 the cdom contained mainly of carboxyl c o and polysaccharide c oh groups as for the asynchronous maps two negative cross peaks λ1 λ2 1080 cm 1 235 nm 850 cm 1 235 nm were always observed in the two ph treatments according to the noda s rule the binding sequences of dom functional groups were 840 cm 1 265 nm 235 nm 1080 cm 1 for ph 4 7 and 265 nm 235 nm 840 cm 1 1080 cm 1 for ph 6 0 this indicated that at low ph and high is e g ph 4 7 and is 0 1 m pb ii was firstly interacted with aryl c h followed by cdom265 and then polysaccharide c oh groups however when ph increased to 6 0 cdom265 gave the first response to pb ii binding and then aryl c h and polysaccharide c oh groups overall the binding dynamics of dom groups in response to pb ii addition were regulated by both ph and is 3 6 significance of this study due to the important role of dom in manipulating the chemical speciation and toxicity of heavy metals metal dom interactions have received increasing attention many spectral techniques and models including eem parafac xu et al 2013a differential spectra yan et al 2015 2d cos coupled with synchronous fluorescence hur and lee 2011 ftir chen et al 2014 huang et al 2018 and nmr yu et al 2011 probes and nica donnan model yan et al 2013a have recently been applied to characterize the metal dom interaction although the differential spectra combined with nica donna model is a powerful approach to examine the nature and extent of metal dom interactions it suffered from ambiguities in the structural assignment for example it is not previously clear as to what was the specific functional group having a characteristic wavelength of 200 300 nm the 2d uv ftir heterospectral correlation spectroscopy however can be used to assign chromophoric dom with specific ftir groups and more importantly clarify the relationship between the two techniques combining the two complementary techniques as shown for the first attempt in this study can become a powerful approach for elucidating the correlation and sequential orders of different functional groups in response to metal binding based on the application of differential approach and nica donnan model the close correlations between concentrations of dom bound pb ii and dslope350 400 da235 dfc1 and dfc2 r 2 0 85 suggested that these parameters can be used to quantify the in situ metal dom interaction in addition the 2d heterospectral correlation analysis can integrate two different spectral probes by applying 2d uv ftir heterospectral correlation spectroscopy our results for the first time revealed the pb ii binding with chromophoric and non chromophoric substances simultaneously and identified their ph and is dependent binding sequences in environmentally relevant conditions our new results on the extent and dynamics of metal binding with dom should contribute to the better understanding of the organic inorganic interfacial interaction and thus the ecological role and environmental fate of metal dom complex in natural and engineered aquatic systems 4 conclusion differential spectra combined with 2d uv ftir heterospectral correlation analysis were applied for the first time to probe the process and mechanism of pb ii binding with dom although the zero order absorption spectra were featureless differential spectra including differential zero order and log transformed spectra showed an uneven distribution of active sites and functional groups within dom pool for pb ii binding application of differential spectra also revealed the heterogeneities in binding extent among different chromophoric and fluorescent groups in addition parameters dslope350 400 dfc1 and dfc2 were found to be significantly correlated with the concentrations of dom bound pb ii while those of da235 were related to the amounts of pb ii bound by carboxylic groups the 2d uv ftir heterospectral correlation analysis further identified the ph and is dependent dom pb ii binding heterogeneities in sequential orders of dom functional groups in response to metal addition the combined techniques should be a promising approach to probe into the

19378,waste stabilisation ponds wsps are the method of choice for sewage treatment in most arctic communities because they can operate in extreme climate conditions require a relatively modest investment are passive and therefore easy and inexpensive to operate and maintain however most arctic wsps are currently limited in their ability to remove carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod total suspended solids tss and ammonia nitrogen an arctic wsp differs from a southern wsp in the way it is operated and in the conditions under which it operates consequently existing wsp models cannot be used to gain better understanding of the arctic lagoon performance this work describes an arctic specific wsp model it accounts for both aerobic and anaerobic degradation pathways of organic materials and considers the periodic nature of wsp operation as well as the partial or complete freeze of the water in the wsp during winter a uniform multi layer ice aerobic anaerobic and sludge approach was taken in the model development which simplified and expedited numerical solution of the model enabling efficient model calibration to available field data graphical abstract image 1 keywords arctic facultative lagoon wsp dynamic model icecap 1 introduction waste stabilisation ponds wsps also called sewage lagoons or facultative lagoons are used for secondary treatment of municipal sewage by many small communities around the globe because they require a relatively modest investment they are easy and inexpensive to operate and maintain by locally available personnel wsps are the method of choice for sewage treatment in most canadian arctic communities because they can operate in extreme climate conditions and avoid some of the key challenges of mechanical treatment in the north johnson et al 2014 despite their advantages most arctic wsps are currently limited in their ability to remove carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod total suspended solids tss and ammonia nitrogen wsps often appear as an immediate upstream process to wetlands so that direct discharge of sewage to wetlands could occur due to poor wsp performance importantly the wetlands can provide 47 94 cbod and 39 98 tss removal yates et al 2012 there are some fundamental differences between wsps operated in the arctic and those operated elsewhere whereas in non arctic settings the lagoon is generally full constant water volume and is operated as a flow through system the extreme sub zero temperatures in the arctic winter do not usually allow for any outflow of effluent as this would freeze instantly moreover as the sewage in the arctic lagoon is ice capped during most of the year a low organic removal rate can be expected during this cold period as a result the typical arctic wsp has a volume designed to accommodate an entire year of sewage production with the sewage flowing into the wsp during the year the wsp is typically emptied decanted in late summer to early fall in some locations wsps are decanted slowly during the entire summer after decanting the wsp is ready to receive the next year s sewage production these conditions make all existing wsp models unsuitable for simulating arctic wsps despite the simplicity of wsp design and the practical experience gained from its use for several decades all around the world a complete understanding of all the physical chemical and biological processes involved is still an ongoing area of research sah et al 2012 the complexity of the various processes that take place simultaneously in wsp necessitated simplification in modeling efforts some existing models focus on specific processes governing lagoon physics chemistry for example many of the existing models focus on hydrodynamics for a better wsp geometry design in 1d 2d or 3d aldana et al 2005 martínez et al 2014 sah et al 2011 salter et al 2000 sweeney et al 2003 other models take a particular modelling approach such as completely mixed or plug flow and focus on the biochemical processes for a better understanding of the biodegradation processes and effluent quality beran and kargi 2005 dochain et al 2003 houweling et al 2005 peng et al 2007 other models still focus primarily on describing the sedimentation mechanisms of the particulates jupsin and vasel 2007 toprak 1994 or the daily kayombo et al 2000 or seasonal banks et al 2003 chaturvedi et al 2014 oxygen dynamics temperature profiles have also been the object of study and modeling in wsps operated in moderate climates gu and stefan 1995 sweeney et al 2005 more recently the coupling of hydrodynamic equations with biochemical processes produced a complex 3d model sah et al 2011 that provides a detailed component distribution in the lagoon however such 3d models are difficult to calibrate given existing scarce experimental data often lacking measurements at different lagoon depths and locations some kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for the biochemical processes can be assumed from well established models used in other domains e g adm1 batstone et al 2002 and asm3 henze et al 2000 however in general the literature reflects scant information with regard to calibration and validation of models with full scale wsp data sah et al 2012 in the arctic this dearth of wsp field data is even greater due to extreme winter conditions and remoteness of wsp locations ragush et al 2015 the formation of a thick ice cover in arctic lagoons for 6 8 months of the year depending on location increases modeling complexity as it affects all physical and biological mechanisms of cod removal the proposed dynamic model endeavours to close the gap by considering the periodic nature of lagoon operation in the arctic as well as the impact of ice cover on wsp performance 2 model formulation 2 1 modeling approach the proposed model uses a multi layer approach to describe the existence of several distinct zones in a facultative lagoon the multi layer approach to modeling was successfully applied in the past to various biological systems with significant oxygen carbon source or biomass gradients rauch et al 1999 tartakovsky and guiot 1997 accordingly the model proposes the existence of three distinct layers at any given time each assumed to be completely mixed in the relatively warm period in the summer the top layer is assumed to be aerobic liquid the middle layer anaerobic liquid and the bottom layer is sludge assumed to always be under anaerobic conditions the depth of the aerobic layer is expected to be restricted to 20 50 cm due to limited oxygen penetration no forced aeration and fast oxygen consumption by aerobic bacteria hunik et al 1994 stephenson et al 1999 tartakovsky et al 2006 the assumption of a thin aerobic layer is also supported by ragush et al 2015 who observed a consistently low dissolved oxygen concentration throughout the lagoon depth in the cold period the wsp is assumed to be completely ice capped which means that there is no oxygen flow from the air into the liquid the depletion of oxygen in the liquid due to icing is assumed to be nearly instantaneous consequently there is no aerobic layer during the cold season the anaerobic layer of liquid can become partially or completely frozen depending on ambient temperatures the sludge layer is assumed to remain in a liquid state due to its depth as well as due to exothermic microbial activities microbial activities such as anaerobic fermentation of organic materials and anaerobic conversion of fermentation products to biomethane are exothermic and result in heat production conrad 1999 which helps to prevent the sludge layer from freezing it is noted however that in very shallow lagoons the sludge could freeze at very low temperatures in the proposed model such an event can be simulated by setting the growth and biodegradation rates to zero in the sludge layer fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the layers considered during the warm and cold periods during the warm season the depth or thickness of the aerobic layer z ae is considered to be constant while the depth of the anaerobic z an and the sludge z sl layers increases as a result of the daily addition of raw wastewater it is to be noted that settling of solids is not explicitly considered in the proposed model with the following rationale the time scale for settling is typically in the range of several hours to a few days at most initial attempts at utilizing a much more complex 3d model which also accounted for settling of solids showed that at a large time scale such as one year of lagoon operation instant settling of the solids can be assumed without significantly affecting modeling results also cod transfer between ice and liquid during ice formation is neglected 2 2 icecap modeling a separate model was developed to estimate the thickness of ice as a function of the ambient temperature profiles degree days this model was developed based on work by ashton et al ashton 1983 1986 1989 with modifications to account for the heat flux from the relatively warm sewage inflow to the ice layer and for the insulating properties of snow cover a detailed description of the icecap model is provided in supplementary information appendix a the direct coupling of the icecap model to the multi layer lagoon model would have resulted in more complex computations and a slower combined model with a marginal improvement in accuracy moreover year round lagoon water temperature data are currently not available but the onset of ice formation and the end of ice thaw periods are easily observed and therefore more often known the icecap model is therefore used to estimate the time at which the icecap begins to form the time at which it reaches maximum thickness and the time at which it completely melts the maximum icecap thickness is also estimated these estimated values are subsequently used in the lagoon model under the simplifying assumption of constant rate of freeze ice growth and constant rate of ice thaw it is noted that while the model assumes uniform thickness of the ice layer at the discharge location of warm sewage to the lagoon the ice layer is either much thinner or nonexistent however this localized thinning is very small compared to the entire surface area of the lagoon and is therefore deemed to be negligible 2 3 biodegradation modeling in formulating the biodegradation several simplifying assumptions were made towards reducing model integration time and facilitating model calibration although adm1 and asm3 models consider multiple microbial populations in the absence of arctic specific data on the distribution of microbial populations the proposed model only consideres facultative heterotrophic x b h and anaerobic x b an microorganisms these populations are assumed to be present in all layers also only readily biodegradable soluble s s and particulate x s organic materials are considered in the material balances i e the current version of the model does not include nitrogen and phosphorus balances the aerobic and anaerobic liquid layers are assumed to have a saturation maximal attainable concentration x max of suspended solids at the end of each day of model integration the solids in excess of this saturation concentration are assumed to settle directly into the sludge layer another simplifying assumption is that removal or settling of solids from the aerobic and anaerobic layers to the sludge layer is instantaneous also all dissolved components are assumed to be uniformly distributed between the layers instant mixing assumption the instantaneous settling and mixing assumptions can be justified by the fact that the lagoon performance is simulated over a period of one year therefore the settling and mixing processes occurring at a scale of several hours or even days may be considered instantaneous without any significant loss of accuracy material balances and kinetic equations describing the hydrolysis of particulate organic materials and the growth of x b h and x b an microbial populations on soluble organic materials were adapted from asm3 henze et al 2000 in particular multiplicative monod kinetic equations are used to describe both the aerobic and anaerobic anoxic growth of heterotrophic biomass for example aerobic growth of the facultative heterotrophic biomass is described by two multiplicative monod kinetic terms representing available dissolved substrate s s and dissolved oxygen s o concentrations the anaerobic heterotrophic biomass growth is also described by two multiplicative terms representing growth on s s and an oxygen inhibition dependence giving the following overall kinetic equation 1 μ h μ m a x h s s k s h s s s o k o h s o x b h μ m a x h s s k s h s s i k o i k o i s o x b h where μ h is the specific growth rate of the heterotrophic microorganisms μ m a x h is the maximum specific growth rate of the heterotrophs k s h and k o h are the half saturation constants and k o i is the inhibition constant the specific growth rate of anaerobic microorganisms μ a n is described as 2 μ a n μ m a x a n s s k s a n s s k o i k o i s o k a n i k a n i x b a n x b a n where μ m a x a n is the maximum specific growth rate of the anaerobes k s a n is the half saturation constant of anaerobic microorganisms and k a n i is the self inhibition constant the rate of hydrolysis of particulate materials plays an important role in determining the outcome of wastewater treatment as it often represents the slowest biodegradation step the following expression adapted from asm3 model is used to describe the specific hydrolysis rate r h in the proposed model where both aerobic and anaerobic populations contribute to the hydrolysis 3 r h k h h x s i x b h i x b a n i k x h x s i x b h i x b a n i x b h i η x b a n i where k h h is the maximum hydrolysis rate k x h and k b h are the half saturation constants of hydrolysis and η is the fraction of anaerobes x b a n contributing to hydrolysis it is to be noted that the kinetic parameters of the model are assumed to be temperature independent this is because anaerobic microorganisms are known to adapt well to psychrophilic conditions kashyap et al 2003 therefore biodegradation by a complex consortium of psychrophilic and mesophilic microorganisms can be described using such simplifying assumption also the rates of aerobic and anaerobic degradation of soluble organic materials are assumed to be proportional to the growth rates of the corresponding microbial populations finally the arctic is considered to have near arid conditions due to low precipitation rates furthermore all the lagoons examined for this study are man made which means that surrounding embankments do not allow for runoff water to drain into the lagoon consequently dilution due to precipitation was not considered in the current version of the model a detailed description

model calibration and validation the proposed model was calibrated and validated using data collected at three arctic lagoons situated in the hamlets of pond inlet gjoa haven and kugaruuk nunavut canada the three are engineered lagoons with surface areas when full of about 40 000 20 000 13 000 m2 and average depths when full of about 1 6 3 and 3 m respectively available measurements at these lagoons included characterization of raw sewage and samples withdrawn from the lagoons typically near the discharge point during one year only two to three sampling campaigns per year were carried out at each location typically in early or mid summer as well as late summer or early fall towards decanting information provided through these campaigns include total and soluble cod and or bod concentration and total suspended solid tss concentration if total cod concentration values were unavailable they were estimated using bod5 measurements by assuming a cod to bod5 ratio of 2 i e 1 mg l 1 of bod5 is equivalent to 2 mg l 1 of cod biochemical measurements at gjoa haven and kugaruuk were provided by environment and climate change canada eccc unpublished data on lagoon characterization from september 2009 to september 2010 while corresponding daily temperatures precipitation rain and snow and depth of snow on the ground were obtained from the publicly available eccc website and used for icecap formation melting dates and thickness computations biochemical data for pond inlet lagoon were taken from ragush et al 2015 these values represent averages of lagoon sampling between 2011 and 2014 since the icecap thickness and formation melting dates in pond inlet were similar for all years temperature values retrieved from the eccc website for 2009 2010 were used to calculate icecap properties 3 1 icecap formation the icecap formation and decay model described in appendix a was used to estimate the beginning and end of ice formation as well as the icecap thickness temperature and recorded snowfall information from existing environment canada weather stations close to lagoon coordinates was used weather station identification is provided in table 1 fig 2 shows the resulting ice thickness profiles calculated for the pond inlet gjoa haven and kugaruuk lagoons in nunavut canada based on the temperature profiles from september 2009 to september 2010 in the fall of 2009 icecap started forming around september 15th to september 20th relatively soon after decant in all three locations consequently september 15th was considered as t 0 see fig 2 for the model calibration calculations the calculations of ice thickness were carried out for 350 days water discharge was assumed to take place between days 350 365 not shown in fig 2 and effective average snow cover thickness was assumed to be 50 of the snow on the ground values provided by environment canada data as can be seen from fig 2 at all three locations a near constant ice formation rate is estimated resulting in a linear increase of ice thickness up to about day 200 subsequently a constant ice thickness is estimated between days 200 270 followed by a period of relatively fast thaw that culminates with ice free surface at about day 295 it should be noted that only 50 of the accumulated snow on the ground as recorded by environment canada was effectively considered for heat flux calculations as a portion of the snow was assumed to have been blown away due to winds as mentioned earlier the ice formation model was not directly coupled with the lagoon model rather these simulation results were used to determine ice formation parameters start of ice formation and thaw as well as constant ice formation and thaw rates which were used as inputs for the multi layer lagoon model 3 2 biodegradation kinetics initially model parameters related to heterotrophic activity were taken from asm3 henze et al 2000 while degradation rates under anaerobic conditions were assumed from lettinga et al 2001 also initial value of the oxygen transfer coefficient kl was adapted from the work of chaturvedi et al 2014 assuming wind speeds between 1 and 8 m s 1 and an average water temperature of 10 c table 2 provides the values of all model parameters and tables 3 and 4 describe influent wastewater composition and initial conditions used for model integration considering the rather large number of model parameters and the limited number of available measurements only 2 3 sets of cod and tss measurements were available for each lagoon with no biomass measurements at all it was deemed best to identify a small subset of model parameters with the largest influence on model outputs and subsequently calibrate the model using only this limited subset while all other parameters are kept constant at values obtained from the literature the most influential parameters were identified through a sensitivity analysis using eq 8 table 5 summarizes results of this sensitivity analysis based on these results a subset of three parameters was selected for estimation namely the maximum specific growth rate of anaerobic microorganisms μ m a x a n the rate of solid organic matter hydrolysis k h and the oxygen transfer coefficient k l parameter estimation model calibration was performed using data of two lagoons pond inlet and gjoa haven whereby values of parameters μ m a x a n k h and k l that minimized rmse eq 7 were identified all other parameters were held constant fig 3 provides the resulting profiles of total soluble and particulate cods for the pond inlet and gjoa haven lagoons with the calibrated parameters table 6 summarizes the estimated values of these parameters the model was subsequently validated by applying the estimated parameter values to the kugaruuk lagoon fig 4 illustrates a comparison between estimated and observed values of cod and tss measurements in the kugaaruk lagoon it can be seen that in all cases the model predicted a cod accumulation during winter months followed by a relatively fast cod degradation during the ice free period while the predicted trends qualitatively agreed with the observed values the rmse value for kugaruuk validation was higher as expected than for the lagoons used for parameter estimation table 6 it was nonetheless deemed that the model showed a reasonable capability to correctly predict the measured trends in total and dissolved cod concentrations as mentioned earlier the small number of measured data available for calibration presented a significant challenge to the confidence with which the results could be evaluated consequently an additional calibration method was undertaken whereby the estimation procedure was repeated for each lagoon individually in this case however the oxygen transfer coefficient was kept at the estimated value of 6 4 m d 1 while μ m a x a n and k h h values were re estimated for each lagoon as shown in table 6 this approach resulted in smaller rmse values and also demonstrated the differences between the lagoons in terms of μ m a x a n and k h h values since parameter sensitivity analysis showed high impact of these parameters on the model outputs the differences between the lagoons are likely represented by the differences between lagoon specific values it is acknowledged that the scarcity of field data especially in the winter limits the number of estimated model parameters and the accuracy of the parameter estimation procedure the authors are currently involved in an effort to augment available data through year round sampling of a northern lagoon near yellowknife nwt canada while it is too early to report additional results in this study future work will hopefully be based on a much larger dataset 4 discussion while the dearth of calibration data limits the confidence in the accuracy of the results some important and not altogether expected trends on the performance of facultative sewage lagoons in the arctic can be discerned from the model outputs for example a clear trend emerges whereby soluble cod concentration increases consistently during winter months figs 3 and 4 this can be explained by the fact that during winter particulate cod settles and continuously undergoes hydrolysis in the sludge layer of the lagoon albeit at a low rate while at the same time a relatively slow anaerobic degradation acts to reduce soluble cod concentration when the icecap melts away fast reduction in soluble cod concentration can be observed as aerobic activity initiates and increases in the top layer the aerobic growth of suspended heterotrophic biomass is accompanied by biomass settling since the suspended biomass concentration in the aerobic layer is limited by the maximum attainable density x max the aerobic biomass in the sludge layer contributes to hydrolysis of solids according to eq 3 notably the hydrolysis rate is not limited by the absence of oxygen in the sludge as a result the overall rate of hydrolysis accelerates during summer another important observation can be made that although the degradation of organic materials under anaerobic conditions is slow compared to aerobic degradation the anaerobic activity provides a significant contribution to the overall cod removal in the lagoon due to the fact that this activity takes place throughout the year and also due to the high sludge density this can be further demonstrated by comparing different scenarios of cod degradation in the shallow pond inlet lagoon fig 5 a and the deep kugaruuk lagoon fig 5b in one scenario the cod degradation is simulated with the anaerobic rate of cod degradation set to zero only aerobes while in the other scenario the aerobic degradation rate is set to zero only anaerobes it is clear that the absence of anaerobic biodegradation throughout the winter results in cod accumulation in both lagoons if zero anaerobic activity is assumed the rate of aerobic degradation required to achieve observed cod concentrations at the end of summer would have to be increased to an unrealistically high value of approximately 10 d 1 which is not likely given that water temperature in the lagoons does not typically exceed 10 12 c during the summer clearly only a combination of both aerobic and anaerobic degradation activities results in the cod profiles matching the field measurements interestingly the model predicts different cod profiles during winter for each lagoon pond inlet lagoon is relatively shallow about 1 6 m average depth when full in which the ice thickness can reach a maximum of about 1 4 m fig 2 this results in an expected gradual increase of total and soluble cod concentrations throughout the winter due to the absence of biological activity in the ice layer although anaerobic degradation continues in the sludge layer it is not sufficient to considerably reduce soluble cods fig 3 this prediction agrees well with the high cod value measured at the beginning of summer right after the complete melting of the ice cover this accumulation of cods is followed by a relatively fast cod reduction in the summer it can be seen that even in the shallow pond inlet lagoon anaerobic degradation contributes to the overall cod removal as the comparison of different scenarios shown in fig 5a indicates the predicted cod profiles in the much deeper gjoa haven and kugaruuk lagoons followed a somewhat different pattern in these lagoons a fast increase in cod concentrations is predicted during the first 50 60 days followed by slow cod concentration decrease throughout the winter due to anaerobic activity in the unfrozen anaerobic and sludge layers under the ice the rate of cod degradation is predicted to accelerate during the summer figs 3 4 and 5 due to aerobic activity it is noted again that only cod trends in the summer months can be confirmed by observed data profiles of particulate cods in all lagoons were similar with a somewhat higher concentration during summer fast growth of aerobic bacteria in the upper oxygenated layer during summer months is accompanied by biomass settling which contributes to particulate cods as well as to sludge accumulation although it increases the rate of hydrolysis according to model equation 3 notably solids hydrolysis does not require dissolved oxygen and therefore proceeds in the sludge layer where the biomass concentration is the highest a detailed look at the model outputs and the parameter estimation results suggests that the difference in cod profiles can be explained by the differences in lagoon depths the shallow pond inlet lagoon is frozen during 260 days of the year most of this period frozen through except the sludge layer which significantly limits anaerobic activity during winter months during the summer months a high degradation rate is achieved due to higher ratio of aerobic to anaerobic activity in pond inlet an aerobic layer thickness of 40 cm corresponds to approximately 25 of this lagoon depth while in two other lagoons the aerobic layer comprises less than 15 of the total lagoon depth consequently aerobic degradation provides a relatively higher contribution to cod removal at the pond inlet lagoon compared to two other deeper lagoons fig 5 the importance of considering anaerobic microbial activity in northern lagoons appears to be an immediate conclusion with important implications for future lagoon design it can be surmised that some combination of deep and shallow lagoons is likely to provide the best results in terms of degradation of organics in the sewage in fact there is some evidence that multi cell lagoons in the arctic are functioning well it appears that a deep first lagoon is likely to provide substantial anaerobic degradation in winter while a shallow and wide second lagoon will provide substantial aerobic degradation in summer another important consideration in evaluating arctic lagoon performance could be related to the contribution of algae blooms to cod removal this attribution is supported by ragush et al 2018 and schmidt et al 2017 who examined oxygen dynamics and organic degradation for lagoons during the ice free period and demonstrated algae s contribution in supporting aerobic degradation while the current version of the model does not consider algae growth it appears to be indirectly accounted for by the oxygen transfer coefficient k l during long summer days algae are expected to supply oxygen to the top aerobic layer of the lagoon indeed parameter estimation yielded a k l value of 6 4 which is somewhat higher than a range of values suggested in literature 0 9 6 0 m d 1 as indicated in table 2 in addition to increased oxygen supply both phototrophic and heterotrophic growth of algae are likely to contribute to solids accumulation especially after the end of summer when temperatures become lower and days become shorter before the formation of icecap finally consumption of dissolved methane by aerobic methanotrophic bacteria could be another factor affecting both dissolved oxygen and methane concentrations throughout summer future versions of the arctic lagoon model need to be extended to account for these phenomena as well as for nitrogen and phosphorus removal at low temperatures 5 conclusion this study describes a mathematical model capable of simulating the biodegradation of wastewater in arctic wsps the model accounts for several unique features of arctic lagoons including the periodic nature of lagoon operation and the existence of icecap for most of the lagoon operation cycle the proposed model is calibrated and validated using limited observed data obtained at three arctic lagoons within the constraints of limited calibration data and previously noted limitations of the parameter estimation procedure the differences between predicted and measured cod and tss concentration profiles in terms of mean squared error are deemed to be indicative of an acceptable qualitative agreement between them analysis of predicted cod concentration profiles suggests significant anaerobic biodegradation of organic materials throughout winter months the next phase of model development will incorporate field data from a northern sewage lagoon with wintertime measurements of bod cod tss and temperatures at different depths beneath the ice investigation into the contribution of algae and enhancement of the ice thickness model are also planned additional data are expected to nuance and confirm key assumptions as well as improve the model as a tool for analyzing and improving arctic

19378,waste stabilisation ponds wsps are the method of choice for sewage treatment in most arctic communities because they can operate in extreme climate conditions require a relatively modest investment are passive and therefore easy and inexpensive to operate and maintain however most arctic wsps are currently limited in their ability to remove carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod total suspended solids tss and ammonia nitrogen an arctic wsp differs from a southern wsp in the way it is operated and in the conditions under which it operates consequently existing wsp models cannot be used to gain better understanding of the arctic lagoon performance this work describes an arctic specific wsp model it accounts for both aerobic and anaerobic degradation pathways of organic materials and considers the periodic nature of wsp operation as well as the partial or complete freeze of the water in the wsp during winter a uniform multi layer ice aerobic anaerobic and sludge approach was taken in the model development which simplified and expedited numerical solution of the model enabling efficient model calibration to available field data graphical abstract image 1 keywords arctic facultative lagoon wsp dynamic model icecap 1 introduction waste stabilisation ponds wsps also called sewage lagoons or facultative lagoons are used for secondary treatment of municipal sewage by many small communities around the globe because they require a relatively modest investment they are easy and inexpensive to operate and maintain by locally available personnel wsps are the method of choice for sewage treatment in most canadian arctic communities because they can operate in extreme climate conditions and avoid some of the key challenges of mechanical treatment in the north johnson et al 2014 despite their advantages most arctic wsps are currently limited in their ability to remove carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod total suspended solids tss and ammonia nitrogen wsps often appear as an immediate upstream process to wetlands so that direct discharge of sewage to wetlands could occur due to poor wsp performance importantly the wetlands can provide 47 94 cbod and 39 98 tss removal yates et al 2012 there are some fundamental differences between wsps operated in the arctic and those operated elsewhere whereas in non arctic settings the lagoon is generally full constant water volume and is operated as a flow through system the extreme sub zero temperatures in the arctic winter do not usually allow for any outflow of effluent as this would freeze instantly moreover as the sewage in the arctic lagoon is ice capped during most of the year a low organic removal rate can be expected during this cold period as a result the typical arctic wsp has a volume designed to accommodate an entire year of sewage production with the sewage flowing into the wsp during the year the wsp is typically emptied decanted in late summer to early fall in some locations wsps are decanted slowly during the entire summer after decanting the wsp is ready to receive the next year s sewage production these conditions make all existing wsp models unsuitable for simulating arctic wsps despite the simplicity of wsp design and the practical experience gained from its use for several decades all around the world a complete understanding of all the physical chemical and biological processes involved is still an ongoing area of research sah et al 2012 the complexity of the various processes that take place simultaneously in wsp necessitated simplification in modeling efforts some existing models focus on specific processes governing lagoon physics chemistry for example many of the existing models focus on hydrodynamics for a better wsp geometry design in 1d 2d or 3d aldana et al 2005 martínez et al 2014 sah et al 2011 salter et al 2000 sweeney et al 2003 other models take a particular modelling approach such as completely mixed or plug flow and focus on the biochemical processes for a better understanding of the biodegradation processes and effluent quality beran and kargi 2005 dochain et al 2003 houweling et al 2005 peng et al 2007 other models still focus primarily on describing the sedimentation mechanisms of the particulates jupsin and vasel 2007 toprak 1994 or the daily kayombo et al 2000 or seasonal banks et al 2003 chaturvedi et al 2014 oxygen dynamics temperature profiles have also been the object of study and modeling in wsps operated in moderate climates gu and stefan 1995 sweeney et al 2005 more recently the coupling of hydrodynamic equations with biochemical processes produced a complex 3d model sah et al 2011 that provides a detailed component distribution in the lagoon however such 3d models are difficult to calibrate given existing scarce experimental data often lacking measurements at different lagoon depths and locations some kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for the biochemical processes can be assumed from well established models used in other domains e g adm1 batstone et al 2002 and asm3 henze et al 2000 however in general the literature reflects scant information with regard to calibration and validation of models with full scale wsp data sah et al 2012 in the arctic this dearth of wsp field data is even greater due to extreme winter conditions and remoteness of wsp locations ragush et al 2015 the formation of a thick ice cover in arctic lagoons for 6 8 months of the year depending on location increases modeling complexity as it affects all physical and biological mechanisms of cod removal the proposed dynamic model endeavours to close the gap by considering the periodic nature of lagoon operation in the arctic as well as the impact of ice cover on wsp performance 2 model formulation 2 1 modeling approach the proposed model uses a multi layer approach to describe the existence of several distinct zones in a facultative lagoon the multi layer approach to modeling was successfully applied in the past to various biological systems with significant oxygen carbon source or biomass gradients rauch et al 1999 tartakovsky and guiot 1997 accordingly the model proposes the existence of three distinct layers at any given time each assumed to be completely mixed in the relatively warm period in the summer the top layer is assumed to be aerobic liquid the middle layer anaerobic liquid and the bottom layer is sludge assumed to always be under anaerobic conditions the depth of the aerobic layer is expected to be restricted to 20 50 cm due to limited oxygen penetration no forced aeration and fast oxygen consumption by aerobic bacteria hunik et al 1994 stephenson et al 1999 tartakovsky et al 2006 the assumption of a thin aerobic layer is also supported by ragush et al 2015 who observed a consistently low dissolved oxygen concentration throughout the lagoon depth in the cold period the wsp is assumed to be completely ice capped which means that there is no oxygen flow from the air into the liquid the depletion of oxygen in the liquid due to icing is assumed to be nearly instantaneous consequently there is no aerobic layer during the cold season the anaerobic layer of liquid can become partially or completely frozen depending on ambient temperatures the sludge layer is assumed to remain in a liquid state due to its depth as well as due to exothermic microbial activities microbial activities such as anaerobic fermentation of organic materials and anaerobic conversion of fermentation products to biomethane are exothermic and result in heat production conrad 1999 which helps to prevent the sludge layer from freezing it is noted however that in very shallow lagoons the sludge could freeze at very low temperatures in the proposed model such an event can be simulated by setting the growth and biodegradation rates to zero in the sludge layer fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the layers considered during the warm and cold periods during the warm season the depth or thickness of the aerobic layer z ae is considered to be constant while the depth of the anaerobic z an and the sludge z sl layers increases as a result of the daily addition of raw wastewater it is to be noted that settling of solids is not explicitly considered in the proposed model with the following rationale the time scale for settling is typically in the range of several hours to a few days at most initial attempts at utilizing a much more complex 3d model which also accounted for settling of solids showed that at a large time scale such as one year of lagoon operation instant settling of the solids can be assumed without significantly affecting modeling results also cod transfer between ice and liquid during ice formation is neglected 2 2 icecap modeling a separate model was developed to estimate the thickness of ice as a function of the ambient temperature profiles degree days this model was developed based on work by ashton et al ashton 1983 1986 1989 with modifications to account for the heat flux from the relatively warm sewage inflow to the ice layer and for the insulating properties of snow cover a detailed description of the icecap model is provided in supplementary information appendix a the direct coupling of the icecap model to the multi layer lagoon model would have resulted in more complex computations and a slower combined model with a marginal improvement in accuracy moreover year round lagoon water temperature data are currently not available but the onset of ice formation and the end of ice thaw periods are easily observed and therefore more often known the icecap model is therefore used to estimate the time at which the icecap begins to form the time at which it reaches maximum thickness and the time at which it completely melts the maximum icecap thickness is also estimated these estimated values are subsequently used in the lagoon model under the simplifying assumption of constant rate of freeze ice growth and constant rate of ice thaw it is noted that while the model assumes uniform thickness of the ice layer at the discharge location of warm sewage to the lagoon the ice layer is either much thinner or nonexistent however this localized thinning is very small compared to the entire surface area of the lagoon and is therefore deemed to be negligible 2 3 biodegradation modeling in formulating the biodegradation several simplifying assumptions were made towards reducing model integration time and facilitating model calibration although adm1 and asm3 models consider multiple microbial populations in the absence of arctic specific data on the distribution of microbial populations the proposed model only consideres facultative heterotrophic x b h and anaerobic x b an microorganisms these populations are assumed to be present in all layers also only readily biodegradable soluble s s and particulate x s organic materials are considered in the material balances i e the current version of the model does not include nitrogen and phosphorus balances the aerobic and anaerobic liquid layers are assumed to have a saturation maximal attainable concentration x max of suspended solids at the end of each day of model integration the solids in excess of this saturation concentration are assumed to settle directly into the sludge layer another simplifying assumption is that removal or settling of solids from the aerobic and anaerobic layers to the sludge layer is instantaneous also all dissolved components are assumed to be uniformly distributed between the layers instant mixing assumption the instantaneous settling and mixing assumptions can be justified by the fact that the lagoon performance is simulated over a period of one year therefore the settling and mixing processes occurring at a scale of several hours or even days may be considered instantaneous without any significant loss of accuracy material balances and kinetic equations describing the hydrolysis of particulate organic materials and the growth of x b h and x b an microbial populations on soluble organic materials were adapted from asm3 henze et al 2000 in particular multiplicative monod kinetic equations are used to describe both the aerobic and anaerobic anoxic growth of heterotrophic biomass for example aerobic growth of the facultative heterotrophic biomass is described by two multiplicative monod kinetic terms representing available dissolved substrate s s and dissolved oxygen s o concentrations the anaerobic heterotrophic biomass growth is also described by two multiplicative terms representing growth on s s and an oxygen inhibition dependence giving the following overall kinetic equation 1 μ h μ m a x h s s k s h s s s o k o h s o x b h μ m a x h s s k s h s s i k o i k o i s o x b h where μ h is the specific growth rate of the heterotrophic microorganisms μ m a x h is the maximum specific growth rate of the heterotrophs k s h and k o h are the half saturation constants and k o i is the inhibition constant the specific growth rate of anaerobic microorganisms μ a n is described as 2 μ a n μ m a x a n s s k s a n s s k o i k o i s o k a n i k a n i x b a n x b a n where μ m a x a n is the maximum specific growth rate of the anaerobes k s a n is the half saturation constant of anaerobic microorganisms and k a n i is the self inhibition constant the rate of hydrolysis of particulate materials plays an important role in determining the outcome of wastewater treatment as it often represents the slowest biodegradation step the following expression adapted from asm3 model is used to describe the specific hydrolysis rate r h in the proposed model where both aerobic and anaerobic populations contribute to the hydrolysis 3 r h k h h x s i x b h i x b a n i k x h x s i x b h i x b a n i x b h i η x b a n i where k h h is the maximum hydrolysis rate k x h and k b h are the half saturation constants of hydrolysis and η is the fraction of anaerobes x b a n contributing to hydrolysis it is to be noted that the kinetic parameters of the model are assumed to be temperature independent this is because anaerobic microorganisms are known to adapt well to psychrophilic conditions kashyap et al 2003 therefore biodegradation by a complex consortium of psychrophilic and mesophilic microorganisms can be described using such simplifying assumption also the rates of aerobic and anaerobic degradation of soluble organic materials are assumed to be proportional to the growth rates of the corresponding microbial populations finally the arctic is considered to have near arid conditions due to low precipitation rates furthermore all the lagoons examined for this study are man made which means that surrounding embankments do not allow for runoff water to drain into the lagoon consequently dilution due to precipitation was not considered in the current version of the model a detailed description of these equations and the material balances of the model are provided in supplementary information appendix b 2 4 numerical methods at each moment in time the performance of the wsp is described by

model calibration and validation the proposed model was calibrated and validated using data collected at three arctic lagoons situated in the hamlets of pond inlet gjoa haven and kugaruuk nunavut canada the three are engineered lagoons with surface areas when full of about 40 000 20 000 13 000 m2 and average depths when full of about 1 6 3 and 3 m respectively available measurements at these lagoons included characterization of raw sewage and samples withdrawn from the lagoons typically near the discharge point during one year only two to three sampling campaigns per year were carried out at each location typically in early or mid summer as well as late summer or early fall towards decanting information provided through these campaigns include total and soluble cod and or bod concentration and total suspended solid tss concentration if total cod concentration values were unavailable they were estimated using bod5 measurements by assuming a cod to bod5 ratio of 2 i e 1 mg l 1 of bod5 is equivalent to 2 mg l 1 of cod biochemical measurements at gjoa haven and kugaruuk were provided by environment and climate change canada eccc unpublished data on lagoon characterization from september 2009 to september 2010 while corresponding daily temperatures precipitation rain and snow and depth of snow on the ground were obtained from the publicly available eccc website and used for icecap formation melting dates and thickness computations biochemical data for pond inlet lagoon were taken from ragush et al 2015 these values represent averages of lagoon sampling between 2011 and 2014 since the icecap thickness and formation melting dates in pond inlet were similar for all years temperature values retrieved from the eccc website for 2009 2010 were used to calculate icecap properties 3 1 icecap formation the icecap formation and decay model described in appendix a was used to estimate the beginning and end of ice formation as well as the icecap thickness temperature and recorded snowfall information from existing environment canada weather stations close to lagoon coordinates was used weather station identification is provided in table 1 fig 2 shows the resulting ice thickness profiles calculated for the pond inlet gjoa haven and kugaruuk lagoons in nunavut canada based on the temperature profiles from september 2009 to september 2010 in the fall of 2009 icecap started forming around september 15th to september 20th relatively soon after decant in all three locations consequently september 15th was considered as t 0 see fig 2 for the model calibration calculations the calculations of ice thickness were carried out for 350 days water discharge was assumed to take place between days 350 365 not shown in fig 2 and effective average snow cover thickness was assumed to be 50 of the snow on the ground values provided by environment canada data as can be seen from fig 2 at all three locations a near constant ice formation rate is estimated resulting in a linear increase of ice thickness up to about day 200 subsequently a constant ice thickness is estimated between days 200 270 followed by a period of relatively fast thaw that culminates with ice free surface at about day 295 it should be noted that only 50 of the accumulated snow on the ground as recorded by environment canada was effectively considered for heat flux calculations as a portion of the snow was assumed to have been blown away due to winds as mentioned earlier the ice formation model was not directly coupled with the lagoon model rather these simulation results were used to determine ice formation parameters start of ice formation and thaw as well as constant ice formation and thaw rates which were used as inputs for the multi layer lagoon model 3 2 biodegradation kinetics initially model parameters related to heterotrophic activity were taken from asm3 henze et al 2000 while degradation rates under anaerobic conditions were assumed from lettinga et al 2001 also initial value of the oxygen transfer coefficient kl was adapted from the work of chaturvedi et al 2014 assuming wind speeds between 1 and 8 m s 1 and an average water temperature of 10 c table 2 provides the values of all model parameters and tables 3 and 4 describe influent wastewater composition and initial conditions used for model integration considering the rather large number of model parameters and the limited number of available measurements only 2 3 sets of cod and tss measurements were available for each lagoon with no biomass measurements at all it was deemed best to identify a small subset of model parameters with the largest influence on model outputs and subsequently calibrate the model using only this limited subset while all other parameters are kept constant at values obtained from the literature the most influential parameters were identified through a sensitivity analysis using eq 8 table 5 summarizes results of this sensitivity analysis based on these results a subset of three parameters was selected for estimation namely the maximum specific growth rate of anaerobic microorganisms μ m a x a n the rate of solid organic matter hydrolysis k h and the oxygen transfer coefficient k l parameter estimation model calibration was performed using data of two lagoons pond inlet and gjoa haven whereby values of parameters μ m a x a n k h and k l that minimized rmse eq 7 were identified all other parameters were held constant fig 3 provides the resulting profiles of total soluble and particulate cods for the pond inlet and gjoa haven lagoons with the calibrated parameters table 6 summarizes the estimated values of these parameters the model was subsequently validated by applying the estimated parameter values to the kugaruuk lagoon fig 4 illustrates a comparison between estimated and observed values of cod and tss measurements in the kugaaruk lagoon it can be seen that in all cases the model predicted a cod accumulation during winter months followed by a relatively fast cod degradation during the ice free period while the predicted trends qualitatively agreed with the observed values the rmse value for kugaruuk validation was higher as expected than for the lagoons used for parameter estimation table 6 it was nonetheless deemed that the model showed a reasonable capability to correctly predict the measured trends in total and dissolved cod concentrations as mentioned earlier the small number of measured data available for calibration presented a significant challenge to the confidence with which the results could be evaluated consequently an additional calibration method was undertaken whereby the estimation procedure was repeated for each lagoon individually in this case however the oxygen transfer coefficient was kept at the estimated value of 6 4 m d 1 while μ m a x a n and k h h values were re estimated for each lagoon as shown in table 6 this approach resulted in smaller rmse values and also demonstrated the differences between the lagoons in terms of μ m a x a n and k h h values since parameter sensitivity analysis showed high impact of these parameters on the model outputs the differences between the lagoons are likely represented by the differences between lagoon specific values it is acknowledged that the scarcity of field data especially in the winter limits the number of estimated model parameters and the accuracy of the parameter estimation procedure the authors are currently involved in an effort to augment available data through year round sampling of a northern lagoon near yellowknife nwt canada while it is too early to report additional results in this study future work will hopefully be based on a much larger dataset 4 discussion while the dearth of calibration data limits the confidence in the accuracy of the results some important and not altogether expected trends on the performance of facultative sewage lagoons in the arctic can be discerned from the model outputs for example a clear trend emerges whereby soluble cod concentration increases consistently during winter months figs 3 and 4 this can be explained by the fact that during winter particulate cod settles and continuously undergoes hydrolysis in the sludge layer of the lagoon albeit at a low rate while at the same time a relatively slow anaerobic degradation acts to reduce soluble cod concentration when the icecap melts away fast reduction in soluble cod concentration can be observed as aerobic activity initiates and increases in the top layer the aerobic growth of suspended heterotrophic biomass is accompanied by biomass settling since the suspended biomass concentration in the aerobic layer is limited by the maximum attainable density x max the aerobic biomass in the sludge layer contributes to hydrolysis of solids according to eq 3 notably the hydrolysis rate is not limited by the absence of oxygen in the sludge as a result the overall rate of hydrolysis accelerates during summer another important observation can be made that although the degradation of organic materials under anaerobic conditions is slow compared to aerobic degradation the anaerobic activity provides a significant contribution to the overall cod removal in the lagoon due to the fact that this activity takes place throughout the year and also due to the high sludge density this can be further demonstrated by comparing different scenarios of cod degradation in the shallow pond inlet lagoon fig 5 a and the deep kugaruuk lagoon fig 5b in one scenario the cod degradation is simulated with the anaerobic rate of cod degradation set to zero only aerobes while in the other scenario the aerobic degradation rate is set to zero only anaerobes it is clear that the absence of anaerobic biodegradation throughout the winter results in cod accumulation in both lagoons if zero anaerobic activity is assumed the rate of aerobic degradation required to achieve observed cod concentrations at the end of summer would have to be increased to an unrealistically high value of approximately 10 d 1 which is not likely given that water temperature in the lagoons does not typically exceed 10 12 c during the summer clearly only a combination of both aerobic and anaerobic degradation activities results in the cod profiles matching the field measurements interestingly the model predicts different cod profiles during winter for each lagoon pond inlet lagoon is relatively shallow about 1 6 m average depth when full in which the ice thickness can reach a maximum of about 1 4 m fig 2 this results in an expected gradual increase of total and soluble cod concentrations throughout the winter due to the absence of biological activity in the ice layer although anaerobic degradation continues in the sludge layer it is not sufficient to considerably reduce soluble cods fig 3 this prediction agrees well with the high cod value measured at the beginning of summer right after the complete melting of the ice cover this accumulation of cods is followed by a relatively fast cod reduction in the summer it can be seen that even in the shallow pond inlet lagoon anaerobic degradation contributes to the overall cod removal as the comparison of different scenarios shown in fig 5a indicates the predicted cod profiles in the much deeper gjoa haven and kugaruuk lagoons followed a somewhat different pattern in these lagoons a fast increase in cod concentrations is predicted during the first 50 60 days followed by slow cod concentration decrease throughout the winter due to anaerobic activity in the unfrozen anaerobic and sludge layers under the ice the rate of cod degradation is predicted to accelerate during the summer figs 3 4 and 5 due to aerobic activity it is noted again that only cod trends in the summer months can be confirmed by observed data profiles of particulate cods in all lagoons were similar with a somewhat higher concentration during summer fast growth of aerobic bacteria in the upper oxygenated layer during summer months is accompanied by biomass settling which contributes to particulate cods as well as to sludge accumulation although it increases the rate of hydrolysis according to model equation 3 notably solids hydrolysis does not require dissolved oxygen and therefore proceeds in the sludge layer where the biomass concentration is the highest a detailed look at the model outputs and the parameter estimation results suggests that the difference in cod profiles can be explained by the differences in lagoon depths the shallow pond inlet lagoon is frozen during 260 days of the year most of this period frozen through except the sludge layer which significantly limits anaerobic activity during winter months during the summer months a high degradation rate is achieved due to higher ratio of aerobic to anaerobic activity in pond inlet an aerobic layer thickness of 40 cm corresponds to approximately 25 of this lagoon depth while in two other lagoons the aerobic layer comprises less than 15 of the total lagoon depth consequently aerobic degradation provides a relatively higher contribution to cod removal at the pond inlet lagoon compared to two other deeper lagoons fig 5 the importance of considering anaerobic microbial activity in northern lagoons appears to be an immediate conclusion with important implications for future lagoon design it can be surmised that some combination of deep and shallow lagoons is likely to provide the best results in terms of degradation of organics in the sewage in fact there is some evidence that multi cell lagoons in the arctic are functioning well it appears that a deep first lagoon is likely to provide substantial anaerobic degradation in winter while a shallow and wide second lagoon will provide substantial aerobic degradation in summer another important consideration in evaluating arctic lagoon performance could be related to the contribution of algae blooms to cod removal this attribution is supported by ragush et al 2018 and schmidt et al 2017 who examined oxygen dynamics and organic degradation for lagoons during the ice free period and demonstrated algae s contribution in supporting aerobic degradation while the current version of the model does not consider algae growth it appears to be indirectly accounted for by the oxygen transfer coefficient k l during long summer days algae are expected to supply oxygen to the top aerobic layer of the lagoon indeed parameter estimation yielded a k l value of 6 4 which is somewhat higher than a range of values suggested in literature 0 9 6 0 m d 1 as indicated in table 2 in addition to increased oxygen supply both phototrophic and heterotrophic growth of algae are likely to contribute to solids accumulation especially after the end of summer when temperatures become lower and days become shorter before the formation of icecap finally consumption of dissolved methane by aerobic methanotrophic bacteria could be another factor affecting both dissolved oxygen and methane concentrations throughout summer future versions of the arctic lagoon model need to be extended to account for these phenomena as well as for nitrogen and phosphorus removal at low temperatures 5 conclusion this study describes a mathematical model capable of simulating the biodegradation of wastewater in arctic wsps the model accounts for several unique features of arctic lagoons including the periodic nature of lagoon operation and the existence of icecap for most of the lagoon operation cycle the proposed model is calibrated and validated using limited observed data obtained at three arctic lagoons within the constraints of limited calibration data and previously noted limitations of the parameter estimation procedure the differences between predicted and measured cod and tss concentration profiles in terms of mean squared error are deemed to be indicative of an acceptable qualitative agreement between them analysis of predicted cod concentration profiles suggests significant anaerobic biodegradation of organic materials throughout winter months the next phase of model development will incorporate field data from a northern sewage lagoon with wintertime measurements of bod cod tss and temperatures at different depths beneath the ice investigation into the contribution of algae and enhancement of the ice thickness model are also planned additional data are expected to nuance and confirm key assumptions as well as improve the model as a tool for analyzing and improving arctic

19379,perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a group of persistent contaminants that have been identified throughout the aquatic environment in this study ten targeted perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas three targeted pfaa precursors and non targeted pfaa precursors were monitored in four full and pilot scale potable reuse plants at each stage of advanced treatment non targeted pfaa precursors were quantified by applying a total oxidizable precursor assay in which pfaa precursors are oxidized by hydroxyl radicals to targeted pfaas two of the potable reuse systems had membrane based treatments with reverse osmosis and uv advanced oxidation ro uv aop and two used ozone biological activated carbon filtration and granular activated carbon adsorption o3 bac gac the total targeted pfaas in the four tertiary effluents the influent sources for the potable reuse systems ranged from 52 to 227 ng l with non targeted pfaa precursors accounting for 30 67 of total pfass on a molar basis the ro uv aop treatment trains reduced pfaas and pfaa precursors to below their method reporting limits through the barrier provided by ro the o3 bac gac based treatment trains reduced but did not completely remove pfaas or pfaa precursors and the pfass present in the product water were primarily shorter chain pfaas some of which lack human health guidance values for drinking water the relative fraction of targeted shorter chain pfaas increased after each treatment step indicating that there was preferential removal of the pfaa precursors and longer chain pfaas this study provides new insight on the concentrations and treatment of pfaa precursors through potable reuse treatment systems keywords perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass perfluoroalkyl acid precursors total oxidizable precursor assay potable reuse advanced treatment trains 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a diverse class of chemicals used as surfactants processing aids fire retardants and repellent coatings kissa 2001 buck et al 2011 pfass can be used in numerous applications due to the high chemical and thermal stability of their carbon fluorine covalent bonds kissa 2001 this stability combined with their solubility in water kissa 2001 has contributed to the detection of pfass throughout the aquatic environment including surface waters hansen et al 2002 boulanger et al 2004 huset et al 2008 nakayama et al 2010 sun et al 2016 groundwaters post et al 2009 2013 stormwaters zushi and masunaga 2009 muller et al 2011 houtz and sedlak 2012 wastewaters houtz et al 2016 dauchy et al 2017 pan et al 2016 and drinking waters quiñones and snyder 2009 post et al 2013 appleman et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 the most commonly manufactured and detected species have historically been two perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos wang et al 2014 both pfoa and pfos are long chain compounds customarily defined as a perfluorinated chain containing at least seven fluorinated carbons u s epa 2013 in 2016 due to the negative human health effects linked to pfoa and pfos the u s environmental protection agency u s epa released a provisional health advisory limiting both compounds and their sum to 70 ng l in drinking water u s epa 2016 the u s epa has also sought to limit the manufacturing of long chain pfass through the pfoa stewardship program u s epa 2006 2013 this has resulted in a shift to the production of short chain compounds and perfluoroether carboxylic and sulfonic acids which has already been reflected in environmental waters houtz et al 2016 sun et al 2016 however these specific compounds represent only a fraction of the pfass marketed globally a subset of pfass are referred to as pfaa precursors because they can be chemically or biologically degraded into identifiable pfaas schultz et al 2006 rhoads et al 2008 lee et al 2010 houtz and sedlak 2012 zhang et al 2013 pfaa precursors include perfluoroalkylsulfonamide e g perfluorooctanesulfonamide fosa fluorotelomer sulfonates and alcohols e g perfluoroalkyl phosphate mono and di esters and polyfluorinated phospinates yet there may be other fluorinated polymers or proprietary pfass given the difficulty in detecting these species individually houtz and sedlak 2012 developed a total oxidizable precursor top assay to determine the total concentration of non targeted pfaa precursors in this assay precursors are oxidized by the hydroxyl radical to form perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas previous studies have applied this assay to stormwaters groundwaters rivers and wastewaters and all found that non targeted pfaa precursors were present in suburban and urban stormwaters pfaa precursors made up a median of 64 of the total pfass on a molar basis houtz and sedlak 2012 in groundwaters collected from an unlined aqueous film forming foams afff training site an average of 23 was found houtz et al 2013 in a wastewater impacted river a range of 28 69 were pfaa precursors ye et al 2014 wastewaters effluents impacted by afff and non impacted sites were found to contain a range of 33 66 houtz et al 2016 wastewaters are a major entry route for known pfass to the aquatic environment schultz et al 2006 sinclair and kannan 2006 xiao et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 from both industrial sources e g afff impacted sites and industrial surfactant manufacturing and municipal wastewaters e g consumer products houtz et al 2016 dauchy et al 2017 therefore the risk of pfass entering potable reuse waters is particularly acute the advanced treatment processes used for potable reuse systems vary depending on the application but can generally be differentiated between membrane based processes which apply reverse osmosis ro followed by an uv advanced oxidation process aop and those that use ozonation and biological activated carbon bac alternative systems using a combination of these two types may include granular activated carbon gac or the use of low relative to ro energy membrane filtration such as microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf to meet the stringent water quality standards required for both microbial and chemical contaminants and reduce the economic and environmental cost gerrity et al 2013 past work with advanced treatment systems has shown that only gac nanofiltration nf and ro provide significant removal for pfass tang et al 2006 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 appleman et al 2013 rahman et al 2014 however removal by gac is both chain length and functional group dependent i e based on electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with long chain compounds generally removed more effectively than their short chain counterparts appleman et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 the objective of this study was to understand the fate of non targeted pfaa precursors through four full and pilot scale potable reuse process systems ten pfaa compounds and three pfaa precursors were quantified to compare the relative importance of the non targeted pfaa precursors of the four systems two treatment trains were membrane based with ro and uv aop as their two final stages of treatment and two were ozone bac gac based samples were collected following each stage of treatment and at points where the treatment trains could potentially reject compounds e g ro concentrate to confirm the removal of specific pfaas 2 materials and methods materials chemicals reagents and method details from this study are shown in section s1 of the supporting information si full and pilot scale treatment plant operation four full and pilot scale potable reuse treatment facilities sites a d from different areas of the u s were sampled table 1 the influent to the site a pilot plant was treated by full scale conventional activated sludge cas biological phosphorus removal and tertiary filtration with anthracite the non disinfected water was then fed to the pilot plant ozonated at a mg o3 mg toc dose of approximately 1 5 2 and filtered by bac bituminous coal operated at an empty bed contact time ebct of 16 min the bac filters were acclimated with ozonated tertiary effluent from another potable reuse facility for approximately 1 5 years prior to the pilot operation the next stage of treatment involved two parallel mf and uf membranes which were chloraminated the effluent from these membranes was subsequently combined and treated by ro and uv aop with chlorine site b employed full scale cas tertiary filtration and disinfection with chlorine prior to treatment by mf ro and uv aop using hydrogen peroxide in a full scale advanced treatment facility the product water is then blended with a nearby surface water sw site c s pilot plant influent was treated at full scale via cas biological phosphorus removal and tertiary filtration with anthracite and sand within the pilot plant water was ozonated at a mg o3 mg toc ratio of 0 8 and run through two parallel bac bituminous coal filters these bac filters contained activated carbon media in use for 10 years at a full scale water reclamation plant before being acclimated for 8 months onsite and operated at ebcts of 10 and 20 min the effluents of these two bac filters were then combined and treated by a gac adsorber bituminous coal operated at an ebct of 10 min approximately 10 000 throughput bed volumes bvs had run through the gac adsorber when the top assay samples were collected the site d pilot plant was fed by a full scale plant that employed cas and tertiary filtration with sand this effluent

prior to the installation of bac media at this site it was used at a drinking water treatment plant for over two years and then acclimated to site d for three months before sample collection the uf membrane was chloraminated to prevent biofouling when the site d top assay samples were collected approximately 56 000 throughput bvs had passed through the gac adsorber sample collection and analytical methods grab samples were collected from sites a d at various points along their treatment trains table 1 at site a ambient and top assay samples were collected once on 2 3 16 ambient samples from site b were collected four times 7 9 14 2 25 15 6 2 15 9 15 15 with the top assay collected during the final sampling event for site c ambient samples were collected twice 10 20 16 and 11

collected mid way through the pilot operation on 2 16 17 this dataset is limited in that duplicate samples for ambient waters and the top assay were not able to be collected from each site but the efficacy of each treatment was evaluated by comparison between sites ambient waters of site b c were analyzed for the following pfass pfba pfbs pfpna pfhxa pfhxs pfhpa pfoa pfos pfna pfda n mefosaa 6

modified version of u s epa method 537 was employed for all samples and laboratory and field blanks isotopically labeled standards were used whenever possible quiñones and snyder 2009 appleman et al 2014 pisarenko et al 2015 samples were extracted via automated solid phase extraction aspe with hydrophilic lipophilic balance cartridges and preconditioned with mtbe methanol and water extractions were eluted with methanol and a methanol mtbe mix and concentrated with nitrogen gas the extracts were stored at 20 c until they could be analyzed by isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms total oxidizable precursor assay method and validation within a week of receipt samples were subjected to oxidation using the method applied in houtz and sedlak 2012 briefly this method involved generating high concentrations of hydroxyl radical by the thermolysis of persulfate as shown in section s2 of the si specifically 4 g of potassium persulfate and 5 ml of 10 n naoh were added to 250 ml of sample samples were then placed in a temperature controlled water bath at 85 c and exposed for 6 h the ph was monitored every hour to prevent it from dropping and if necessary additional naoh was added to keep the ph 11 samples were subsequently cooled and returned to a ph between 5 and 9 through the dropwise addition of concentrated hcl for sites a d the molar concentration of non targeted pfaa precursors was calculated by first subtracting out the molar contribution from the specific precursors n mefosaa 6 2 fts and 8 2 fts and then subtracting out the molar concentration of ambient pfcas section s2 of the si to determine if the assay was properly adapted from houtz and sedlak 2012 two validation tests were conducted targeted pfaa precursor compounds n me fosaa and 8 2 fts were spiked into deionized lab grade water at 1 μg l oxidized as discussed above and analyzed for the concentration of pfoa post oxidation in this study pfoa had a molar yield of 116 for n mefosaa and of 19 for 8 2 fts this was within the range of molar yields observed previously of 110 8 for n mefosaa and 21 2 for 8 2 fts houtz and sedlak 2012 3 results and discussion ambient pfaas the ambient levels reported below and shown in fig 1 are from samples collected in parallel with the top assay however for sites b d multiple sampling events were undertaken table s2 figures s1 s3 and these data are reported below as average increases or decreases for individual pfaas site a contained the highest total tertiary effluent concentration with 227 ng l whereas sites b c and d had lower mass loads of 52 ng l 60 ng l and 55 ng l respectively fig 1 molar concentrations followed the same trend site a 692 pm site c 227 pm site d 176 pm site b 169 pm for site a ozonation resulted in an increase in the total concentration of targeted pfaas which was driven by an additional 20 of pfhxa δ 14 ng l and 50 of pfhpa δ 5 ng l oxidation via ozone of pfaas is ineffective schröder and meesters 2005 takagi et al 2011 but pfaa precursor compounds can be degraded to form pfaas anumol et al 2016 pisarenko et al 2015 specifically past work found that pfhxa and pfbs were the most commonly detected species post ozonation of tertiary wastewaters pisarenko et al 2015 however the ozonation of 6 2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic ftuca and 8 2 ftuca in surface water and groundwater formed both pfhxa and pfhpa anumol et al 2016 neither 6 2 ftuca nor 8 2 ftuca were determined analytically in this study but their presence could account for the increases in pfhxa and pfhpa found in site a anumol et al 2016 bac followed ozonation at site a and concentrations of pfpna pfhxa pfhpa and pfoa increased in the effluent by 53 δ 25 ng l 30 δ 38 ng l 53 δ 8 ng l and 24 δ 21 ng l respectively treatment with new gac is effective in removing pfaas with longer chain compounds generally having better removal efficiencies due to their hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with the gac higgins and luthy 2006 yu et al 2009 appleman et al 2013 however desorption of pfaas can occur over time as short chain compounds are outcompeted for sorption sites by longer chain pfaas or effluent organic matter eschauzier et al 2012 appleman et al 2013 2014 site a bac had been in use for 1 5 years prior to its four month acclimation at the pilot meaning that desorption of pfaas from the media was a possible cause for the observed 35 total mass increase though another explanation is that there was a biotransformation of pfaa precursors similar to what has been previously observed during wastewater treatment sinclair and kannan 2006 lee et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 following the bac effluent parallel treatment with mf and uf resulted in a slight increase in the total pfaa concentration of 6 δ 22 ng l for mf and 3 δ 10 ng l for uf increases in the mf effluent were driven by changes in pfhxa δ 10 ng l and pfoa δ 10 ng l whereas the uf unit change was entirely due to pfhxa δ 10 ng l with the large pore sizes of mf and uf membranes and low relative molecular weights of pfaas no change following treatment was expected however trace organic contaminants have been shown to adsorb to mf and uf membrane fibers or the fouling layer and it is possible that the presence of more favorable compounds could result in a desorption from the membranes similar to what was observed during bac treatment yoon et al 2004 2006 the next step in treatment ro reduced all pfaas to below their mrls and thus uv with chlorine was not evaluated site b is a full scale advanced treatment facility that blends its finished effluent with a nearby sw over the four sampling campaigns the tertiary effluent contained 2 7 to 10 3 times the total targeted pfaa concentration as compared to the sw fig s1 as seen in site a mf treatment increased the total pfaa concentration by an average of 30 17 over four sampling events with low level contributions 1 3 ng l from several short chain pfaas pfpna pfhxa and pfhxs table s2 fig s1 like site a the application of ro reduced the concentration of all pfaas to below their mrls and the efficacy of uv h2o2 could not be determined with pfaa concentrations below their mrls the final advanced treated product water improved the water quality of the final blend with sw site c applied ozone bac and gac instead of ro uv aop the application of ozone during two sampling campaigns table s2 fig s2 increased the concentration of targeted pfaas with an average of 12 3 4 or 6 8 1 6 ng l on a mass basis which was significantly lower than the increase observed in site a this difference could be due to the dose of ozone applied with site c using an o3 toc ratio of 0 8 as compared to 1 5 2 for site a pisarenko et al 2015 the next treatment step bac also resulted in negligible removal of targeted pfaas 7 3 3 or 3 6 ng l in contrast to sites a and d discussed below the media used at sites a and d had been in use for approximately two years including previous use and site specific acclimation but the media in site c had been in use for more than 10 years at a potable reuse facility before it was transferred to the pilot scale system and in place for 8 months of acclimation before this sample was collected this means the sorption capacity in site c was likely exhausted and that any desorption of compounds had already occurred during the acclimation period with the media and water reaching an equilibrium these data also imply that biotransformation did not produce targeted pfaas at this site following the ozone bac treatment gac resulted in the removal of compounds with molecular weights of 400 g mol or more i e pfoa pfos pfna pfda and pfhxs to below their mrls the shorter chain compounds pfbs pfpna pfhxa and pfhpa with molecular weights less than 400 g mol remained in the effluent at concentrations of 6 1 ng l 28 ng l 9 3 ng l and 0 87 ng l respectively when the gac sample was collected pfbs pfpna pfhxa and pfhpa were at 51 100 62 and 48 breakthrough ceffluent cinfluent respectively the site d treatment train employed ozone bac uf gac uv h2o2 over six sampling events fig s3 the initial step of ozonation slightly increased the total pfaa concentration 6 2 5 5 or 4 2 4 4 ng l similar to site c a lower dose o3 toc 1 of ozone was applied relative to site a and this likely led to the low formation of pfaas bac followed ozonation with a total pfaa concentration increase of 36 9 or 23 9 ng l this change was primarily due to the increases in low molecular weight compounds pfpna 71 20 or 14 5 8 ng l and pfhxa 54 24 or 9 5 3 8 ng l and like site a this was probably due to the competition for sorption sites and potentially due to biotransformation the next treatment uf also increased the total concentration of pfaas 21 9 or 19 14 ng l through changes in pfpna 41 18 or 16 11 ng l and pfhxa 19 11 or 5 5 4 2 ng l this trend was also observed for sites a mf uf and site b mf at the time point shown in fig 1 the application of gac treatment reduced the total pfaas by 43 but the short chain pfbs pfba pfpna pfhxa and pfhpa compounds remained at 2 1 ng l 5 3 ng l 18 ng l 37 ng l and 0 84 ng l in the effluent the compounds detected in the final effluent were at more than 40 breakthrough except for pfhpa at 28 the final treatment of uv h2o2 did not provide additional removal for pfbs pfba pfpna pfhxa and pfhpa which was expected given the low reaction rates of these compounds by uv h2o2 in past work under similar conditions hori et al 2004 across the utilities the most prevalent compounds detected more than 85 on a molar basis had molecular masses less than 400 g mol this could in part be attributed to the switch in manufacturing from longer chain compounds to their short chain analogs as observed in past work houtz et al 2016 but could also be a function of the degradation of long chain compounds during both wastewater treatment and advanced treatment schultz et al 2006 lee et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 the largest increases of targeted pfaas after ozonation occurred at site a where the highest o3 toc ratio was applied 1 5 2 but comparatively limited increases were observed at sites c and d where the o3 toc ratios were 0 8 1 though likely precursors were present at all three sites as shown below in the top assay results the mf and uf units in sites a b and d did not mitigate the presence of pfaas and instead added to the total concentration with the drivers being pfpna pfhxa pfhxs and pfoa sites a and b used ro and uv aop as the final two steps in their treatment trains in these sites ro treatment removed all targeted pfaas to below their mrls and uv aop could not be evaluated ro removal percentages were generated using the mrl as the effluent concentration meaning that the values represent a worst case scenario and are at least as high as reported table 2 removals agreed with past work at the pilot scale but were lower than values observed in bench scale tests thus higher removal would be expected since the percentages were constrained by the mrl tang et al 2006 appleman et al 2013 2014 the corresponding ambient concentrations found in the ro concentrate as well as the mf and uf backwash are reported in section s4 of the si unlike the ro uv aop treatment trains o3 bac gac treatment trains did not provide complete removal of pfaa compounds o3 bac increased the concentration of low molecular weight pfaas in sites a and d and provided no removal for site c subsequent treatment with gac sites c and d removed compounds but was dependent on molecular weight with compounds less than 400 g mol pfhxa pfpna pfhpa pfbs and pfba remaining in the effluent although these specific compounds could potentially be a risk in potable reuse systems because they would not be further removed by conventional treatment i e coagulation flocculation filtration disinfection quiñones and snyder 2009 the product water concentrations never exceeded guideline values u s epa 2016 pfaa precursors non targeted pfaa precursor removals have not been reported previously but the top assay has been applied to several other wastewaters with data presented on a mass basis ng l as the sum of the increases in pfcas pfba pfpna pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and pfna post oxidation ye et al 2014 houtz et al 2016 the tertiary effluents of sites a d contained sums of 68 ng l 38 ng l 44 ng l and 82 ng l respectively which agrees with the concentrations observed in a set of non afff impacted wastewaters collected in california range of approximately 51 120 ng l houtz et al 2016 and were higher than the average observed in japanese wastewater effluents range of approximately 11 16 ng l ye et al 2014 final product waters in sites c and d the only two sites with non targeted pfaa precursors detected formed 14 ng l and 1 5 ng l of pfcas which were on par with the range of 2 1 9 5 ng l observed in urban river waters in japan ye et al 2014 for comparison with ambient levels of pfcas and pfsas molar pfaa precursor concentrations were generated by two methods targeted precursors n mefosaa 8 2 fts and 6 2 fts were detected by established lc ms ms methods and non targeted precursors were detected using the top assay fig 2 the non targeted pfaa precursors were calculated by subtracting the molar contribution of the three targeted pfaa precursors from the relevant pfcas pfba pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and pfna as well as the initial concentration of pfcas found in ambient waters section s2 of the si the remaining sum of pfcas was attributed to the presence of non targeted pfaas non targeted pfaa precursors were found at 283 pm in site a tertiary effluent and reduced 25 by ozonation the impact of ozone in degrading precursors was confirmed by an increase in targeted pfaas the bac filter further reduced the concentration of precursors by 24 likely due to adsorption or biotransformation as discussed above uf and mf provided additional mitigation with concentrations dropping by 24 and 12 respectively as observed with bac this removal co occurred with an increase in short chain pfaas suggesting that the pfaa precursors out competed the lower molecular weight compounds for sorption sites on the filtration membranes or fouling layer yoon et al 2004 2006 the final two steps of treatment ro and uv chlorine were both below the mrl due to the barrier provided by ro for the targeted precursors one species was detected in each stage of treatment prior to ro n mefosaa was found at 0 23 of the total precursors in the tertiary effluent and 6 2 fts was detected in the ozone effluent bac effluent mf and uf effluents at 0 81 1 2 1 7 and 1 6 respectively the n mefosaa behaved like the non targeted precursors and was removed by ozone to below the mrl in contrast the 6 2 fts was not removed or degraded following ozone bac and mf uf treatment for site b the tertiary effluent had 143 pm of non targeted precursors which was more than 50 times higher than that observed in the sw with 2 2 pm fig 2 mf and ro had comparable removals to those observed in site a with a 33 removal following mf treatment and removal to below detection for ro again the uv h2o2 was not able to be evaluated for targeted precursors the sw tertiary effluent and mf effluent contained low ng l levels of 6 2 fts as a percentage of the total precursors this constituted 19 in the sw 1 9 in the tertiary effluent and 1 in the mf effluent mirroring the effect seen for ambient pfaas the advanced treated water would decrease the overall concentration of targeted and non targeted precursors when blended with the sw in the two non ro uv aop sites non targeted and targeted pfaa precursors were detected at each stage of treatment including the final effluent the tertiary effluent of site c contained 185 pm and the application of ozone did not significantly degrade precursors 2 which was reflected in the low formation of targeted pfaas bac treatment increased the concentration of non targeted pfaa precursors by 16 213 pm due to an apparent desorption of precursors displaced by effluent organic matter or other constituents within the ozonated effluent the gac finishing adsorber reduced the non targeted pfaa precursors by 64 even after operation for 10 000 bvs and 100 breakthrough of pfoa gac treatment was anticipated to have significant adsorption capacity for non targeted precursors based on past work with high molecular weight pfaas appleman et al 2013 2014 while the complex non fluorinated functional group can have a significant impact on removal the bulk pfaa precursors in site c were removed more efficiently than low molecular weight pfaas xiao et al 2017 6 2 fts was detected in the tertiary effluent 0 78 and the ozone effluent 1 2 but was removed to below the mrl by the gac adsorber in site d each step sequentially removed non targeted pfaa precursors from the initial concentration of 359 pm in the tertiary wastewater ozonation provided 16 removal which was higher than site c 2 in which a similar dose of ozone was applied but lower than site a 25 where a higher dose was applied this illustrates that both the ozone dose and the composition of the tertiary effluent and precursors influences the total degradation of precursors bac provided approximately three times 69 the removal seen in site a 24 this behavior was credited to the remaining sorption capacity of this media which had been used at a drinking water treatment plant for two years prior to a three month acclimation onsite filtration with uf provided limited removal 15 similar to that in site a 12 a gac adsorber followed the treatment with uf and lowered the concentration an additional 45 the two uv aop units in sites a and b were preceded by ro meaning that they could not be evaluated but in site d non targeted precursors were still present and reduced by 3 5 after uv h2o2 degradation of long chain precursors by uv h2o2 has been observed in past work where n ethyl perfluoroocatane sulfonamidoethanol n etfosaa n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide and perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetate were degraded by hydroxyl radical to terminal end products of pfoa and fosa plumlee et al 2009 and 8 2 fluorotelomer alcohol was degraded to pfoa and pfna gauthier and mabury 2005 neither pfoa nor pfna were detected in the uv h2o2 effluent but pfpna increased by 3 ng l pfpna is a known by product of the uv h2o2 degradation of 6 2 ftuca anumol et al 2016 as well as the hydroxyl radical mediated degradation of 6 2 fts 8 2 fts 6 2 dipap and 8 2 dipap houtz and sedlak 2012 targeted precursors of site d made up a small fraction of the total pfass with 0 5 found in the tertiary effluent and ozone effluent and 0 28 found in the bac effluent no targeted precursors were identified in the uf gac or uv h2o2 effluents the trends observed during site d treatment agree with the removal of precursors by either degradation ozone uv h2o2 or physical processes bac uf and gac as a percentage of the total pfass analyzed the non targeted pfaa precursors in site a composed 30 of the pfass in the tertiary effluent both ozonation and bac reduced this fraction until it remained at 12 through the mf and uf treatments the sw tested in site b contained a low total concentration of pfass with non targeted pfaa precursors representing only 10 of the total pfass measured this could be an indication of the degradation of pfaa precursors within the environment resulting in significantly more targeted species than non targeted pfaa precursors the percentage was higher in the tertiary effluent for site b with 45 which was reduced to 33 in the mf effluent for site c the tertiary effluent contained 45 non targeted precursors which was reduced to 33 in the gac effluent site d had an initial fraction in the tertiary effluent of 67 which was reduced to 15 by the end of treatment these data indicate that the non targeted pfaa precursors were removed more efficiently than targeted pfaas specifically low molecular weight pfaas the top assay primarily produced compounds with molecular masses of less than 400 g mol in the tertiary effluent the average increases during the top assay were 27 11 ng l for pfba 20 10 ng l for pfpna 9 8 ng l for pfhxa 5 4 ng l for pfhpa 6 1 ng l for pfoa and 0 4 0 7 ng l for pfna past work has shown that the degradation of 6 2 fts and 6 2 polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diester 6 2 dipap produces primarily pfba pfpna and pfhxa as opposed to the 8 2 analogs that primarily produce pfoa and pfna houtz and sedlak 2012 both n etfosaa and n mefosaa produce entirely pfoa upon oxidation houtz and sedlak 2012 the small increases in pfoa and pfna showed that there were possibly fosaa or 8 2 precursors present but they were not as prevalent as the 6 2 species 4 conclusions targeted pfaas targeted pfaa precursors and non targeted pfaa precursors were detected in the tertiary effluents of all four potable reuse facilities the two ro uv aop treatment trains eliminated all three fractions to below their mrls through the barrier provided by ro advanced treatment with ozone bac generally removed non targeted pfaa precursors but mixed results were observed for the targeted pfaas where either no removal was observed or total concentration increased this increase driven by pfaas with molecular masses less than 400 g mol was attributed to the ozonation of pfaa precursors and the desorption of short chain pfaas unexpectedly the mf and uf membranes behaved like bac filters in that the pfaa precursors were mitigated and concentrations of targeted pfaas increased in the effluent gac had a molecular mass dependence in its capacity to remove pfass as has been observed in past work in the one instance where pfass were detected in the uv h2o2 influent there was minimal degradation of non targeted pfaa precursors that resulted in a slight increase in the targeted pfaas although the ozone bac gac treatment trains contained targeted pfaas and non targeted pfaa precursors in the final effluent initial concentrations were significantly reduced and a sum of all targeted c4 c10 compounds were below the 70 ng l health based guideline developed by the u s epa for the sum of pfoa and pfos u s epa 2016 in both the ozone bac gac sites and the ro uv aop sites the relative fraction of targeted pfaas especially short chain compounds increased after each treatment indicating that there was preferential removal of the pfaa

19379,perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a group of persistent contaminants that have been identified throughout the aquatic environment in this study ten targeted perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas three targeted pfaa precursors and non targeted pfaa precursors were monitored in four full and pilot scale potable reuse plants at each stage of advanced treatment non targeted pfaa precursors were quantified by applying a total oxidizable precursor assay in which pfaa precursors are oxidized by hydroxyl radicals to targeted pfaas two of the potable reuse systems had membrane based treatments with reverse osmosis and uv advanced oxidation ro uv aop and two used ozone biological activated carbon filtration and granular activated carbon adsorption o3 bac gac the total targeted pfaas in the four tertiary effluents the influent sources for the potable reuse systems ranged from 52 to 227 ng l with non targeted pfaa precursors accounting for 30 67 of total pfass on a molar basis the ro uv aop treatment trains reduced pfaas and pfaa precursors to below their method reporting limits through the barrier provided by ro the o3 bac gac based treatment trains reduced but did not completely remove pfaas or pfaa precursors and the pfass present in the product water were primarily shorter chain pfaas some of which lack human health guidance values for drinking water the relative fraction of targeted shorter chain pfaas increased after each treatment step indicating that there was preferential removal of the pfaa precursors and longer chain pfaas this study provides new insight on the concentrations and treatment of pfaa precursors through potable reuse treatment systems keywords perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass perfluoroalkyl acid precursors total oxidizable precursor assay potable reuse advanced treatment trains 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a diverse class of chemicals used as surfactants processing aids fire retardants and repellent coatings kissa 2001 buck et al 2011 pfass can be used in numerous applications due to the high chemical and thermal stability of their carbon fluorine covalent bonds kissa 2001 this stability combined with their solubility in water kissa 2001 has contributed to the detection of pfass throughout the aquatic environment including surface waters hansen et al 2002 boulanger et al 2004 huset et al 2008 nakayama et al 2010 sun et al 2016 groundwaters post et al 2009 2013 stormwaters zushi and masunaga 2009 muller et al 2011 houtz and sedlak 2012 wastewaters houtz et al 2016 dauchy et al 2017 pan et al 2016 and drinking waters quiñones and snyder 2009 post et al 2013 appleman et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 the most commonly manufactured and detected species have historically been two perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos wang et al 2014 both pfoa and pfos are long chain compounds customarily defined as a perfluorinated chain containing at least seven fluorinated carbons u s epa 2013 in 2016 due to the negative human health effects linked to pfoa and pfos the u s environmental protection agency u s epa released a provisional health advisory limiting both compounds and their sum to 70 ng l in drinking water u s epa 2016 the u s epa has also sought to limit the manufacturing of long chain pfass through the pfoa stewardship program u s epa 2006 2013 this has resulted in a shift to the production of short chain compounds and perfluoroether carboxylic and sulfonic acids which has already been reflected in environmental waters houtz et al 2016 sun et al 2016 however these specific compounds represent only a fraction of the pfass marketed globally a subset of pfass are referred to as pfaa precursors because they can be chemically or biologically degraded into identifiable pfaas schultz et al 2006 rhoads et al 2008 lee et al 2010 houtz and sedlak 2012 zhang et al 2013 pfaa precursors include perfluoroalkylsulfonamide e g perfluorooctanesulfonamide fosa fluorotelomer sulfonates and alcohols e g perfluoroalkyl phosphate mono and di esters and polyfluorinated phospinates yet there may be other fluorinated polymers or proprietary pfass given the difficulty in detecting these species individually houtz and sedlak 2012 developed a total oxidizable precursor top assay to determine the total concentration of non targeted pfaa precursors in this assay precursors are oxidized by the hydroxyl radical to form perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas previous studies have applied this assay to stormwaters groundwaters rivers and wastewaters and all found that non targeted pfaa precursors were present in suburban and urban stormwaters pfaa precursors made up a median of 64 of the total pfass on a molar basis houtz and sedlak 2012 in groundwaters collected from an unlined aqueous film forming foams afff training site an average of 23 was found houtz et al 2013 in a wastewater impacted river a range of 28 69 were pfaa precursors ye et al 2014 wastewaters effluents impacted by afff and non impacted sites were found to contain a range of 33 66 houtz et al 2016 wastewaters are a major entry route for known pfass to the aquatic environment schultz et al 2006 sinclair and kannan 2006 xiao et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 from both industrial sources e g afff impacted sites and industrial surfactant manufacturing and municipal wastewaters e g consumer products houtz et al 2016 dauchy et al 2017 therefore the risk of pfass entering potable reuse waters is particularly acute the advanced treatment processes used for potable reuse systems vary depending on the application but can generally be differentiated between membrane based processes which apply reverse osmosis ro followed by an uv advanced oxidation process aop and those that use ozonation and biological activated carbon bac alternative systems using a combination of these two types may include granular activated carbon gac or the use of low relative to ro energy membrane filtration such as microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf to meet the stringent water quality standards required for both microbial and chemical contaminants and reduce the economic and environmental cost gerrity et al 2013 past work with advanced treatment systems has shown that only gac nanofiltration nf and ro provide significant removal for pfass tang et al 2006 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 appleman et al 2013 rahman et al 2014 however removal by gac is both chain length and functional group dependent i e based on electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with long chain compounds generally removed more effectively than their short chain counterparts appleman et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 the objective of this study was to understand the fate of non targeted pfaa precursors through four full and pilot scale potable reuse process systems ten pfaa compounds and three pfaa precursors were quantified to compare the relative importance of the non targeted pfaa precursors of the four systems two treatment trains were membrane based with ro and uv aop as their two final stages of treatment and two were ozone bac gac based samples were collected following each stage of treatment and at points where the treatment trains could potentially reject compounds e g ro concentrate to confirm the removal of specific pfaas 2 materials and methods materials chemicals reagents and method details from this study are shown in section s1 of the supporting information si full and pilot scale treatment plant operation four full and pilot scale potable reuse treatment facilities sites a d from different areas of the u s were sampled table 1 the influent to the site a pilot plant was treated by full scale conventional activated sludge cas biological phosphorus removal and tertiary filtration with anthracite the non disinfected water was then fed to the pilot plant ozonated at a mg o3 mg toc dose of approximately 1 5 2 and filtered by bac bituminous coal operated at an empty bed contact time ebct of 16 min the bac filters were acclimated with ozonated tertiary effluent from another potable reuse facility for approximately 1 5 years prior to the pilot operation the next stage of treatment involved two parallel mf and uf membranes which were chloraminated the effluent from these membranes was subsequently combined and treated by ro and uv aop with chlorine site b employed full scale cas tertiary filtration and disinfection with chlorine prior to treatment by mf ro and uv aop using hydrogen peroxide in a full scale advanced treatment facility the product water is then blended with a nearby surface water sw site c s pilot plant influent was treated at full scale via cas biological phosphorus removal and tertiary filtration with anthracite and sand within the pilot plant water was ozonated at a mg o3 mg toc ratio of 0 8 and run through two parallel bac bituminous coal filters these bac filters contained activated carbon media in use for 10 years at a full scale water reclamation plant before being acclimated for 8 months onsite and operated at ebcts of 10 and 20 min the effluents of these two bac filters were then combined and treated by a gac adsorber bituminous coal operated at an ebct of 10 min approximately 10 000 throughput bed volumes bvs had run through the gac adsorber when the top assay samples were collected the site d pilot plant was fed by a full scale plant that employed cas and tertiary filtration with sand this effluent was then treated with ozone at a mg o3 mg toc ratio of 1 bac bituminous coal at an ebct of 15 min uf gac bituminous coal at an ebct of 15 min and uv aop at 900 mj cm2 with 10 mg l of hydrogen peroxide prior to the installation of bac media at this site it was used at a drinking water treatment plant for over two years and then acclimated to site d for three months before sample collection the uf membrane was chloraminated to prevent biofouling when the site d top assay samples were collected approximately 56 000 throughput bvs had passed through the gac adsorber sample collection and analytical methods grab samples were collected from sites a d at various points along their treatment trains table 1 at site a ambient and top assay samples were collected once on 2 3 16 ambient samples from site b were collected four times 7 9 14 2 25 15 6 2 15 9 15 15 with the top assay collected during the final sampling event for site c ambient samples were collected twice 10 20 16 and 11 10 16 with the top assay sample collected during the second sampling event ambient site d samples were collected six times 1 4 17 2 16 17 4 13 17 6 8 17 7 27 17 and 8 10 17 with top assay samples collected mid way through the pilot operation on 2 16 17 this dataset is limited in that duplicate samples for ambient waters and the top assay were not able to be collected from each site but the efficacy of each treatment was evaluated by comparison between sites ambient waters of site b c were analyzed for the following pfass pfba pfbs pfpna pfhxa pfhxs pfhpa pfoa pfos pfna pfda n mefosaa 6 2 fts and 8 2 fts with the method reporting limits mrls molecular weights and full names shown in table s1 of the s1 for site a this list did not include the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas a modified version of u s epa method 537 was employed for all samples and laboratory and field blanks isotopically labeled standards were used whenever possible quiñones and snyder 2009 appleman et al 2014 pisarenko et al 2015 samples were extracted via automated solid phase extraction aspe with hydrophilic lipophilic balance cartridges and preconditioned with mtbe methanol and water extractions were eluted with methanol and a methanol mtbe mix and concentrated with nitrogen gas the extracts were stored at 20 c until they could be analyzed by isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms total oxidizable precursor assay method and validation within a week of receipt samples were subjected to oxidation using the method applied in houtz and sedlak 2012 briefly this method involved generating high concentrations of hydroxyl radical by the thermolysis of persulfate as shown in section s2 of the si specifically 4 g of potassium persulfate and 5 ml of 10 n naoh were added to 250 ml of sample samples were then placed in a temperature controlled water bath at 85 c and exposed for 6 h the ph was monitored every hour to prevent it from dropping and if necessary additional naoh was added to keep the ph 11 samples were subsequently cooled and returned to a ph between 5 and 9 through the dropwise addition of concentrated hcl for sites a d the molar concentration of non targeted pfaa precursors was calculated by first subtracting out the molar contribution from the specific precursors n mefosaa 6 2 fts and 8 2 fts and then subtracting out the molar concentration of ambient pfcas section s2 of the si to determine if the assay was properly adapted from houtz and sedlak 2012 two validation tests were conducted targeted pfaa precursor compounds n me fosaa and 8 2 fts were spiked into deionized lab grade water at 1 μg l oxidized as discussed above and analyzed for the concentration of pfoa post oxidation in this study pfoa had a molar yield of 116 for n mefosaa and of 19 for 8 2 fts this was within the range of molar yields observed previously of 110 8 for n mefosaa and 21 2 for 8 2 fts houtz and sedlak 2012 3 results and discussion ambient pfaas the ambient levels reported below and shown in fig 1 are from samples collected in parallel with the top assay however for sites b d multiple sampling events were undertaken table s2 figures s1 s3 and these data are reported below as average increases or decreases for individual pfaas site a contained the highest total tertiary effluent concentration with 227 ng l whereas sites b c and d had lower mass loads of 52 ng l 60 ng l and 55 ng l respectively fig 1 molar concentrations followed the same trend site a 692 pm site c 227 pm site d 176 pm site b 169 pm for site a ozonation resulted in an increase in the total concentration of targeted pfaas which was driven by an additional 20 of pfhxa δ 14 ng l and 50 of pfhpa δ 5 ng l oxidation via ozone of pfaas is ineffective schröder and meesters 2005 takagi et al 2011 but pfaa precursor compounds can be degraded to form pfaas anumol et al 2016 pisarenko et al 2015 specifically past work found that pfhxa and pfbs were the most commonly detected species post ozonation of tertiary wastewaters pisarenko et al 2015 however the ozonation of 6 2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic ftuca and 8 2 ftuca in surface water and groundwater formed both pfhxa and pfhpa anumol et al 2016 neither 6 2 ftuca nor 8 2 ftuca were determined analytically in this study but their presence could account for the increases in pfhxa and pfhpa found in site a anumol et al 2016 bac followed ozonation at site a and concentrations of pfpna pfhxa pfhpa and pfoa increased in the effluent by 53 δ 25 ng l 30 δ 38 ng l 53 δ 8 ng l and 24 δ 21 ng l respectively treatment with new gac is effective in removing pfaas with longer chain compounds generally having better removal efficiencies due to their hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with the gac higgins and luthy 2006 yu et al 2009 appleman et al 2013 however desorption of pfaas can occur over time as short chain compounds are outcompeted for sorption sites by longer chain pfaas or effluent organic matter eschauzier et al 2012 appleman et al 2013 2014 site a bac had been in use for 1 5 years prior to its four month acclimation at the pilot meaning that desorption of pfaas from the media was a possible cause for the observed 35 total mass increase though another explanation is that there was a biotransformation of pfaa precursors similar to what has been previously observed during wastewater treatment sinclair and kannan 2006 lee et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 following the bac effluent parallel treatment with mf and uf resulted in a slight increase in the total pfaa concentration of 6 δ 22 ng l for mf and 3 δ 10 ng l for uf increases in the mf effluent were driven by changes in pfhxa δ 10 ng l and pfoa δ 10 ng l whereas the uf unit change was entirely due to pfhxa δ 10 ng l with the large pore sizes of mf and uf membranes and low relative molecular weights of pfaas no change following treatment was expected however trace organic contaminants have been shown to adsorb to mf and uf membrane fibers or the fouling layer and it is possible that the presence of more favorable compounds could result in a desorption from the membranes similar to what was observed during bac treatment yoon et al 2004 2006 the next step in treatment ro reduced all pfaas to below their mrls and thus uv with chlorine was not evaluated site b is a full scale advanced treatment facility that blends its finished effluent with a nearby sw over the four sampling campaigns the tertiary effluent contained 2 7 to 10 3 times the total targeted pfaa concentration as compared to the sw fig s1 as seen in site a mf treatment increased the total pfaa concentration by an average of 30 17 over four sampling events with low level contributions 1 3 ng l from several short chain pfaas pfpna pfhxa and pfhxs table s2 fig s1 like site a the application of ro reduced the concentration of all pfaas to below their mrls and the efficacy of uv h2o2 could not be determined with pfaa concentrations below their mrls the final advanced treated product water improved the water quality of the final blend with sw site c applied ozone bac and gac instead of ro uv aop the application of ozone during two sampling campaigns table s2 fig s2 increased the concentration of targeted pfaas with an average of 12 3 4 or 6 8 1 6 ng l on a mass basis which was significantly lower than the increase observed in site a this difference could be due to the dose of ozone applied with site c using an o3 toc ratio of 0 8 as compared to 1 5 2 for site a pisarenko et al 2015 the next treatment step bac also resulted in negligible removal of targeted pfaas 7 3 3 or 3 6 ng l in contrast to sites a and d discussed below the media used at sites a and d had been in use for approximately two years including previous use and site specific acclimation but the media in site c had been in use for more than 10 years at a potable reuse facility before it was transferred to the pilot scale system and in place for 8 months of acclimation before this sample was collected this means the sorption capacity in site c was likely exhausted and that any desorption of compounds had already occurred during the acclimation period with the media and water reaching an equilibrium these data also imply that biotransformation did not produce targeted pfaas at this site following the ozone bac treatment gac resulted in the removal of compounds with molecular weights of 400 g mol or more i e pfoa pfos pfna pfda and pfhxs to below their mrls the shorter chain compounds pfbs pfpna pfhxa and pfhpa with molecular weights less than 400 g mol remained in the effluent at concentrations of 6 1 ng l 28 ng l 9 3 ng l and 0 87 ng l respectively when the gac sample was collected pfbs pfpna pfhxa and pfhpa were at 51 100 62 and 48 breakthrough ceffluent cinfluent respectively the site d treatment train employed ozone bac uf gac uv h2o2 over six sampling events fig s3 the initial step of ozonation slightly increased the total pfaa concentration 6 2 5 5 or 4 2 4 4 ng l similar to site c a lower dose o3 toc 1 of ozone was applied relative to site a and this likely led to the low formation of pfaas bac followed ozonation with a total pfaa concentration increase of 36 9 or 23 9 ng l this change was primarily due to the increases in low molecular weight compounds pfpna 71 20 or 14 5 8 ng l and pfhxa 54 24 or 9 5 3 8 ng l and like site a this was probably due to the competition for sorption sites and potentially due to biotransformation the next treatment uf also increased the total concentration of pfaas 21 9 or 19 14 ng l through changes in pfpna 41 18 or 16 11 ng l and pfhxa 19 11 or 5 5 4 2 ng l this trend was also observed for sites a mf uf and site b mf at the time point shown in fig 1 the application of gac treatment reduced the total pfaas by 43 but the short chain pfbs pfba pfpna pfhxa and pfhpa compounds remained at 2 1 ng l 5 3 ng l 18 ng l 37 ng l and 0 84 ng l in the effluent the compounds detected in the final effluent were at more than 40 breakthrough except for pfhpa at 28 the final treatment of uv h2o2 did not provide additional removal for pfbs pfba pfpna pfhxa and pfhpa which was expected given the low reaction rates of these compounds by uv h2o2 in past work under similar conditions hori et al 2004 across the utilities the most prevalent compounds detected more than 85 on a molar basis had molecular masses less than 400 g mol this could in part be attributed to the switch in manufacturing from longer chain compounds to their short chain analogs as observed in past work houtz et al 2016 but could also be a function of the degradation of long chain compounds during both wastewater treatment and advanced treatment schultz et al 2006 lee et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 the largest increases of targeted pfaas after ozonation occurred at site a where the highest o3 toc ratio was applied 1 5 2 but comparatively limited increases were observed at sites c and d where the o3 toc ratios were 0 8 1 though likely precursors were present at all three sites as shown below in the top assay results the mf and uf units in sites a b and d did not mitigate the presence of pfaas and instead added to the total concentration with the drivers being pfpna pfhxa pfhxs and pfoa sites a and b used ro and uv aop as the final two steps in their treatment trains in these sites ro treatment removed all targeted pfaas to below their mrls and uv aop could not be evaluated ro removal percentages were generated using the mrl as the effluent concentration meaning that the values represent a worst case scenario and are at least as high as reported table 2 removals agreed with past work at the pilot scale but were lower than values observed in bench scale tests thus higher removal would be expected since the percentages were constrained by the mrl tang et al 2006 appleman et al 2013 2014 the corresponding ambient concentrations found in the ro concentrate as well as the mf and uf backwash are reported in section s4 of the si unlike the ro uv aop treatment trains o3 bac gac treatment trains did not provide complete removal of pfaa compounds o3 bac increased the concentration of low molecular weight pfaas in sites a and d and provided no removal for site c subsequent treatment with gac sites c and d removed compounds but was dependent on molecular weight with compounds less than 400 g mol pfhxa pfpna pfhpa pfbs and pfba remaining in the effluent although these specific compounds could potentially be a risk in potable reuse systems because they would not be further removed by conventional treatment i e coagulation flocculation filtration disinfection quiñones and snyder 2009 the product water concentrations never exceeded guideline values u s epa 2016 pfaa precursors non targeted pfaa precursor removals have not been reported previously but the top assay has been applied to several other wastewaters with data presented on a mass basis ng l as the sum of the increases in pfcas pfba pfpna pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and pfna post oxidation ye et al 2014 houtz et al 2016 the tertiary effluents of sites a d contained sums of 68 ng l 38 ng l 44 ng l and 82 ng l respectively which agrees with the concentrations observed in a set of non afff impacted wastewaters collected in california range of approximately 51 120 ng l houtz et al 2016 and were higher than the average observed in japanese wastewater effluents range of approximately 11 16 ng l ye et al 2014 final product waters in sites c and d the only two sites with non targeted pfaa precursors detected formed 14 ng l and 1 5 ng l of pfcas which were on par with the range of 2 1 9 5 ng l observed in urban river waters in japan ye et al 2014 for comparison with ambient levels of pfcas and pfsas molar pfaa precursor concentrations were generated by two methods targeted precursors n mefosaa 8 2 fts and 6 2 fts were detected by established lc ms ms methods and non targeted precursors were detected using the top assay fig 2 the non targeted pfaa precursors were calculated by subtracting the molar contribution of the three targeted pfaa precursors from the relevant pfcas pfba pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and pfna as well as the initial concentration of pfcas found in ambient waters section s2 of the si the remaining sum of pfcas was attributed to the presence of non targeted pfaas non targeted pfaa precursors were found at 283 pm in site a tertiary effluent and reduced 25 by ozonation the impact of ozone in degrading precursors was confirmed by an increase in targeted pfaas the bac filter further reduced the concentration of precursors by 24 likely due to adsorption or biotransformation as discussed above uf and mf provided additional mitigation with concentrations dropping by 24 and 12 respectively as observed with bac this removal co occurred with an increase in short chain pfaas suggesting that the pfaa precursors out competed the lower molecular weight compounds for sorption sites on the filtration membranes or fouling layer yoon et al 2004 2006 the final two steps of treatment ro and uv chlorine were both below the mrl due to the barrier provided by ro for the targeted precursors one species was detected in each stage of treatment prior to ro n mefosaa was found at 0 23 of the total precursors in the tertiary effluent and 6 2 fts was detected in the ozone effluent bac effluent mf and uf effluents at 0 81 1 2 1 7 and 1 6 respectively the n mefosaa behaved like the non targeted precursors and was removed by ozone to below the mrl in contrast the 6 2 fts was not removed or degraded following ozone bac and mf uf treatment for site b the tertiary effluent had 143 pm of non targeted precursors which was more than 50 times higher than that observed in the sw with 2 2 pm fig 2 mf and ro had comparable removals to those observed in site a with a 33 removal following mf treatment and removal to below detection for ro again the uv h2o2 was not able to be evaluated for targeted precursors the sw tertiary effluent and mf effluent contained low ng l levels of 6 2 fts as a percentage of the total precursors this constituted 19 in the sw 1 9 in the tertiary effluent and 1 in the mf effluent mirroring the effect seen for ambient pfaas the advanced treated water would decrease the overall concentration of targeted and non targeted precursors when blended with the sw in the two non ro uv aop sites non targeted and targeted pfaa precursors were detected at each stage of treatment including the final effluent the tertiary effluent of site c contained 185 pm and the application of ozone did not significantly degrade precursors 2 which was reflected in the low formation of targeted pfaas bac treatment increased the concentration of non targeted pfaa precursors by 16 213 pm due to an apparent desorption of precursors displaced by effluent organic matter or other constituents within the ozonated effluent the gac finishing adsorber reduced the non targeted pfaa precursors by 64 even after operation for 10 000 bvs and 100 breakthrough of pfoa gac treatment was anticipated to have significant adsorption capacity for non targeted precursors based on past work with high molecular weight pfaas appleman et al 2013 2014 while the complex non fluorinated functional group can have a significant impact on removal the bulk pfaa precursors in site c were removed more efficiently than low molecular weight pfaas xiao et al 2017 6 2 fts was detected in the tertiary effluent 0 78 and the ozone effluent 1 2 but was removed to below the mrl by the gac adsorber in site d each step sequentially removed non targeted pfaa precursors from the initial concentration of 359 pm in the tertiary wastewater ozonation provided 16 removal which was higher than site c 2 in which a similar dose of ozone was applied but lower than site a 25 where a higher dose was applied this illustrates that both the ozone dose and the composition of the tertiary effluent and precursors influences the total degradation of precursors bac provided approximately three times 69 the removal seen in site a 24 this behavior was credited to the remaining sorption capacity of this media which had been used at a drinking water treatment plant for two years prior to a three month acclimation onsite filtration with uf provided limited removal 15 similar to that in site a 12 a gac adsorber followed the treatment with uf and lowered the concentration an additional 45 the two uv aop units in sites a and b were preceded by ro meaning that they could not be evaluated but in site d non targeted precursors were still present and reduced by 3 5 after uv h2o2 degradation of long chain precursors by uv h2o2 has been observed in past work where n ethyl perfluoroocatane sulfonamidoethanol n etfosaa n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide and perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetate were degraded by hydroxyl radical to terminal end products of pfoa and fosa plumlee et al 2009 and 8 2 fluorotelomer alcohol was degraded to pfoa and pfna gauthier and mabury 2005 neither pfoa nor pfna were detected in the uv h2o2 effluent but pfpna increased by 3 ng l pfpna is a known by product of the uv h2o2 degradation of 6 2 ftuca anumol et al 2016 as well as the hydroxyl radical mediated degradation of 6 2 fts 8 2 fts 6 2 dipap and 8 2 dipap houtz and sedlak 2012 targeted precursors of site d made up a small fraction of the total pfass with 0 5 found in the tertiary effluent and ozone effluent and 0 28 found in the bac effluent no targeted precursors were identified in the uf gac or uv h2o2 effluents the trends observed during site d treatment agree with the removal of precursors by either degradation ozone uv h2o2 or physical processes bac uf and gac as a percentage of the total pfass analyzed the non targeted pfaa precursors in site a composed 30 of the pfass in the tertiary effluent both ozonation and bac reduced this fraction until it remained at 12 through the mf and uf treatments the sw tested in site b contained a low total concentration of pfass with non targeted pfaa precursors representing only 10 of the total pfass measured this could be an indication of the degradation of pfaa precursors within the environment resulting in significantly more targeted species than non targeted pfaa precursors the percentage was higher in the tertiary effluent for site b with 45 which was reduced to 33 in the mf effluent for site c the tertiary effluent contained 45 non targeted precursors which was reduced to 33 in the gac effluent site d had an initial fraction in the tertiary effluent of 67 which was reduced to 15 by the end of treatment these data indicate that the non targeted pfaa precursors were removed more efficiently than targeted pfaas specifically low molecular weight pfaas the top assay primarily produced compounds with molecular masses of less than 400 g mol in the tertiary effluent the average increases during the top assay were 27 11 ng l for pfba 20 10 ng l for pfpna 9 8 ng l for pfhxa 5 4 ng l for pfhpa 6 1 ng l for pfoa and 0 4 0 7 ng l for pfna past work has shown that the degradation of 6 2 fts and 6 2 polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diester 6 2 dipap produces primarily pfba pfpna and pfhxa as opposed to the 8 2 analogs that primarily produce pfoa and pfna houtz and sedlak 2012 both n etfosaa and n mefosaa produce entirely pfoa upon oxidation houtz and sedlak 2012 the small increases in pfoa and pfna showed that there were possibly fosaa or 8 2 precursors present but they were not as prevalent as the 6 2 species 4 conclusions targeted pfaas targeted pfaa precursors and non targeted pfaa precursors were detected in the tertiary effluents of all four potable reuse facilities the two ro uv aop treatment trains eliminated all three fractions to below their mrls through the barrier provided by ro advanced treatment with ozone bac generally removed non targeted pfaa precursors but mixed results were observed for the targeted pfaas where either no removal was observed or total concentration increased this increase driven by pfaas with molecular masses less than 400 g mol was attributed to the ozonation of pfaa precursors and the desorption of short chain pfaas unexpectedly the mf and uf membranes behaved like bac filters in that the pfaa precursors were mitigated and concentrations of targeted pfaas increased in the effluent gac had a molecular mass dependence in its capacity to remove pfass as has been observed in past work in the one instance where pfass were detected in the uv h2o2 influent there was minimal degradation of non targeted pfaa precursors that resulted in a slight increase in the targeted pfaas although the ozone bac gac treatment trains contained targeted pfaas and non targeted pfaa precursors in the final effluent initial concentrations were significantly reduced and a sum of all targeted c4 c10 compounds were below the 70 ng l health based guideline developed by the u s epa for the sum of pfoa and pfos u s epa 2016 in both the ozone bac gac sites and the ro uv aop sites the relative fraction of targeted pfaas especially short chain compounds increased after each treatment indicating that there was preferential removal of the pfaa
