24285,the reliability of crop models for predicting ecophysiological processes determines applicability of models in modern agricultural research and production however many uncertainties in the modeling processes are strangling the extension of model application model parameterization is one of the major sources of prediction uncertainties which depends on the observations used for model calibration oc in this study we conducted a two year field experiment to evaluate the effect of variation in oc on model prediction error and uncertainty model performance was analyzed after the calibration of each dataset we found that model bias was the dominant factor for the overall prediction error with the low variation of oc model uncertainty would contribute more to overall prediction error when oc increased to a threshold of circa 14 5 the low variation of oc resulted in a lower variation of prediction error 0 04 26 8 than that of the high variation of oc 0 4 71 8 the variation of prediction error was different across environments that model simulated besides the prediction error and uncertainty of in season variables such as biomass and leaf area index etc were also more significant than end season variables such as final grain yield our findings highlighted that the variability in observations was a major contributor to model prediction uncertainty during the

have considered the uncertainty in model calibration caused by crop phenology alderman and stanfill 2016 wallach et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however questions about the uncertainty caused by other observations e g crop yield biomass and leaf area index lai remain unclear therefore we evaluated model uncertainty caused by variations in observations including yield biomass and lai based on a two year field experiment with different sowing dates oryza version 3 oryza v3 used in this case study is robust and widely used in modeling studies about rice deng et al 2019 hameed et al 2019 li et al 2017 ling et al 2021 lu et al 2020 nurulhuda et al 2022 radanielson et al 2018 tan et al 2022 tan et al 2021 xu et al 2022 the objectives of this study are to i identify the contribution of model uncertainty caused by oc and inherent simulation capability of model structure to the prediction error and ii assess the effect of variation in oc on the prediction error and prediction uncertainty 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description oryza v3 is a daily step rice model that follows the daily calculation scheme for the rate of phenological development and dry matter production fig a 1 the phenological development rate is described by the average daily air temperature and photoperiod function the daily gross canopy co2 assimilation rate is calculated by integrating the instantaneous rate of leaf co2 assimilation over the leaf area and sunshine hours the net daily growth rate of dry matter is the difference between assimilation production and respiration consumption according to the partitioning coefficients of the root shoot leaf stem and storage organs at different developmental stages the net dry matter is partitioned among various plant organs daily the model structure and improved algorithms were fully described in the model documentation by bouman et al 2001 and li et al 2017 in this study oryza v3 was used to simulate the dynamics of daily rice growth including lai total above ground biomass wagt stem biomass wst green leaf biomass wlvg panicle biomass wso and grain yield 2 2 field experiment and data arrangement for model evaluation a two year field experiment was conducted in lanjie village huaqiao township wuxue county hubei province china 30 06 n 115 45 e daily weather data came from an automatic weather station aws 800 campbell scientific inc america near the experimental field soil chemical properties were investigated once at 0 20 cm layer at the beginning of the experiment following the standard soil sampling procedure lu 2000 the soil ph organic matter and total n values were 5 81 20 6 and 0 19 g kg 1 respectively and the available olsen p and exchangeable k were 5 28 and 46 4 mg kg 1 respectively these properties represented the general soil conditions of the experimental paddy field to create adequate variability of observations we set six treatment of sowing dates sd including april 20 sd 1 may 10 sd 2 may 30 sd 3 in 2012 april 20 sd 4 may 10 sd 5 may 30 sd 6 in 2013 each treatment had four replicates one of the local dominant rice cultivars huanghuazhan was cultivated in the experimental field the seedlings were transplanted 26 31 days after sowing with 13 3 26 6 cm spacing the fertilizer n p and k applied to the main field were 195 33 and 125 kg ha 1 respectively other management practices were conducted according to the recommendations for high yielding in that region rice phenology was recorded timely including stages of panicle initiation pi heading hd and physiological maturity pm fourteen plant samples were randomly collected in each stage for all replicates to investigate biomass allocation the samples were separated into leaf stem plus sheathe and panicle at the reproductive stage the green leaf area at the pi and hd stages was measured using a leaf area metre li 3100 li cor lincoln ne usa to calculate lai grain yield is the grain biomass plus 14 moisture and grain biomass was determined from an area of 5 m2 in each plot in this study oij denotes an observation for sd i replicate j oi denotes the average of four replicates for sd i there were two types of variation in oc one was the variation in replicates low variation of oc represented by the difference between oij and oi another one was the variation among sds high variation of oc represented by the differences between oi and oj the first type of variation was due to measurement uncertainty microclimate heterogeneity or intraspecific variability while the second type was the variation in response to different climate conditions and or management 2 3 model calibration calibration is the process of optimizing selected model parameters by observations in order to reach desirable simulation accuracy two strategies did the calibrations one was using data from an individual replicate of a given sd oij another was using data from an individual sd oi in oryza v3 most parameters can be used as a default value for rice crops however some are variety specific and need to be calibrated bouman et al 2001 we selected 48 of those parameters for calibration according to previous study results and experts recommendations li et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 these parameters included 4 phenological development parameters 9 leaf growth parameters 26 biomass growth and partitioning parameters 7 drought stress parameters and 2 nitrogen parameters table a 1 calibration was performed following the standard procedure in two steps bouman et al 2001 bouman and van laar 2006 firstly the phenological parameters were calibrated by drate v2 exe program to ensure that the lengths of the pi hd and pm stages were correctly simulated drate v2 is a program to compute the phenology development based on the observed phenological data the recorded phenological stages were the same among replicates in a given sd secondly other parameters related to lai wagt wst wlvg and wso were calibrated by the autocalibrationtion3 exe program autocalibrationtion3 is a tool for improving calibration efficiency and avoiding users subjectivity on making decision by targeting the same variables in model calibration and validation li et al 2017 this program generated a set of parameters from a search based optimizer to simultaneously minimize the discrepancies between the simulations and observations of the selected variables normalized root means square error nrmse has been widely used to quantify the relative simulation errors bouman et al 2001 he et al 2017 wang et al 2017 in the control file of this program nrmse values for five growth variables were set according to experts recommendations the nrmse was calculated as follows 1 nrmse 1 x i 1 n x i y i 2 n 100 where xi and yi were the paired observed and predicted values x was the average of all observations of xi and n was the number of observations 2 4 prediction scenarios three scenarios were set to evaluate the effect of variation of oc on prediction results including biomass lai and final grain yield i e prediction scenarios based on the calibration of replicates in each sowing date psrep prediction scenarios based on the calibration of average data of sowing dates pssd and control check scenarios ck the psrep evaluated the effect of oc with a low variation on prediction results by simulating a given sd i using each of the four sets of parameters derived from an individual oij of sd i fig 1 the pssd evaluated the effect of oc with a high variation on prediction results by simulating a given sd i using each of the five sets of parameters derived from an individual ok of sd k k i furthermore ck scenarios were performed with simulations of a given sd i using parameters derived from oi we assumed the nominal value of parameters in sd i is the calibrated parameters from oi which usually represents the optimized settings in the field study prediction results in psrep and pssd were compared with the simulation results from the corresponding sd i in ck the prediction error is defined as the discrepancy between predicted value and observation the overall prediction error was calculated as the difference between the output of the prediction scenarios and corresponding observations in this study overall prediction error was decomposed into model uncertainty and model bias as follows 2 m o pd o ck m o pd m o ck m o ck o ck model uncertainty model bias where mopd was the model output in the prediction scenario ock was the observation to be predicted and mock was the model output in the ck model uncertainty was the variation of prediction results arised from oc variation which was calculated as the difference between the output of the prediction scenarios and output of ck model bias was the simulation error when simulating with the nominal value of parameters which was calculated as the calibration error of ck the contribution of model uncertainty cmu and model bias cmb to the overall prediction error were assessed as follows 3 c mb m o ck o ck m o pd o ck 4 c mu m o pd m o ck m o pd o ck moreover the correlations between the model uncertainty and the variation of the observations and the correlations between overall prediction error and its two divisions were analysed using a linear regression model to compare the model uncertainty of different variables we calculated the relative changes of the predicted values to that of the ck rc pv which was calculated as follows 5 rc pv m o pd m o ck m o ck 100 analogously the relative changes in observations used for model calibration rc oc and calibrated parameters rc cp were calculated furthermore we defined prediction uncertainty as the variation of prediction errors the range of nrmse caused by oc variation was used to quantify the prediction uncertainty in this study palosuo et al 2011 the model uncertainty only relates to the variability of the predicted values while the prediction uncertainty concerns both the predicted values and the observations gao et al 2021 r program version 3 4 1 package plyr and ggplot2 was used for the calculations and figures 3 results 3 1 contribution of model uncertainty and model bias to prediction error for the prediction of biomass and grain yield in psrep the median cmb and median cmu were 0 71 0 98 and 0 02 0 29 respectively which indicated that model bias contributed more than model uncertainty to overall prediction error table 1 however model bias contributed less than model uncertainty in pssd with median cmb and median cmu were 0 21 0 50 and 0 50 0 79 respectively for lai prediction the major contribution to the overall prediction error was from model uncertainty in both psrep median cmu 0 93 and pssd median cmu 0 99 furthermore in the biomass predictions of psrep model bias explained more than 70 of the variations of overall prediction error with the coefficient of determination values r2 between model bias and overall prediction error being greater than 0 70 which indicated a strong correlation between them fig 2 on the contrary a strong correlation between model uncertainty and overall prediction error were observed with the r2 values being greater than 0 50 fig 3 these results revealed that the major contributing factor to overall prediction error could shift from model bias to model uncertainty when the variation of oc changed from about 4 2 psrep to about 14 5 pssd fig 4 3 2 effects of observations used for calibration on model uncertainties the relative changes of oc rc oc and predicted values rc pv are shown in fig 4 in psrep the mean value of rc oc was 4 2 and the median values ranged from 2 6 to 5 6 for all variables in pssd the mean value of rc oc was 14 5 and the median values ranged from 6 1 to 20 4 for all variables the results showed that oc variations were consistently lower among replicates of a given sd treatment than across different sds with the highest variation occurring in lai and the lowest in grain yield compared to the rc oc the mean values of rc pv in psrep and pssd were 4 6 and 15 9 respectively with median values and distribution ranges were approximate to that in rc oc for simulation variables fig 4 the model uncertainties were found to have the same distribution patterns as oc variations do furthermore correlations between the absolute variations in the observations and simulations were strong and positive especially for lai wlvg and yield with r2 values of 0 844 0 700 and 0 584 respectively fig a 2 these results implied that deviation of oc could cause changes in the model outputs at similar degrees of variation through the calibration process details about observations including rice phenology lai the biomass of different organs and grain yield were displayed in table a 2 3 3 impacts of observations used for calibration on prediction uncertainty the nrmses between the predicted and observed growth variables are presented for the scenarios of psrep fig 5 and pssd fig 6 the performance of the models was often evaluated as excellent good acceptable and poor based on the criteria of nrmse values being less than 10 between 10 and 20 between 20 and 30 and larger than 30 respectively chen et al 2022 confalonieri et al 2016a costa filho et al 2021 jamieson et al 1991 in ck scenarios all the average nrmse of six sds in wagt wlvg wst wso lai and grain yield were less than 15 which showed a high inherent simulation capability of the model however the prediction error and prediction uncertainty of growth variables were significantly affected by oc in psrep the nrmses across prediction scenarios were similar to that of ck fig 5 blue points vs red points but were larger than that of ck in pssd fig 6 blue points vs red points predictions with higher nrmse than that of ck accounted for 54 2 in psrep and 86 1 in pssd the ranges of nrmse for each growth variable are shown in figs 5 6 with blue bars across six sowing dates the ranges of nrmse for all the variables were higher in pssd 0 4 71 8 than that in psrep 0 04 26 8 the higher ones corresponding to higher oc variations the range of nrmse in pssd was largest in lai 4 9 71 8 and lowest in grain yield 0 4 22 7 it is worth noting that the highest and lowest variations of oc were also found in lai and grain yield respectively these results suggested that high oc variability could lead to a risk of reducing prediction accuracy as well increasing prediction uncertainty moreover the discrepancy in nrmse between prediction and calibration scenarios varied across six sds as well as the ranges of nrmse fig 6 which indicated a non uniform response of prediction error and uncertainty to oc variation under different conditions such as different sds in this study that model try to mimic 4 discussion model uncertainty from the model structure was usually compared in ensemble simulations of multiple models while the effects of model structure on prediction error within a model were seldom evaluated alderman et al 2016 waha et al 2015 wallach et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 this study separated overall prediction error into model bias and model uncertainty model bias reflects the inherent model capability related to its structure which is intrinsically an unavoidable source of prediction error harmel and smith 2007 model uncertainty raised from model inputs and calibration accuracy usually affected by many factors such as data source quality of observations calibration techniques and methods user subjectivity during calibration etc harmel and smith 2007 confalonieri et al 2016 a b using oryza v3 as a case study we found that model bias was the dominant factor for the overall prediction error in the predictions with low variation of oc table 1 however model uncertainty became the dominant source of overall prediction error when the variation of oc increased to an extent 14 5 in this study and model bias became a secondary source parameterization plays an important role in the accuracy of prediction results to understand the effect of parameters on model prediction errors many studies used sensitivity analyses with a series of generated data for each parameter to test model performance monod et al 2006 tan et al 2017 however little attention has been focused on the response of parameters to oc variation from field experiments confalonieri et al 2016a in this study we found that the variations of calibrated parameters and prediction error were lower in the low variation of oc psrep than in high variation of oc pssd in most cases table a 3 and figs 5 6 indicating that the variation of model output had a positive relationship with the range of parameter variation which was also found in the previous study tan et al 2017 in addition we found that the discrepancies of variation between psrep and pssd were diverse across all parameters involved in model calibration in reality it is difficult to detect how parameterization will affect model output through the calibration process due to parameter equifinality namely the same simulation result could be reached by multiple combinations of parameters which could mask the actual set of parameters relating to physiological processes he et al 2017 a b therefore more efforts are needed to understand the responses of parameters to oc and the responses of individual growth variables to different parameters in crop growth simulations the predictions of end season variables are usually more accurate than in season variables predictions artacho et al 2011 yuan et al 2017 many studies have shown the prediction accuracy of lai was worse than that of grain yield bouman et al 2006 yuan et al 2017 cao et al 2017 in our study model prediction outputs also had a similar trend figs 5 6 we found that the oc variations of in season variables were higher than that of end season variables leading to a higher prediction error we speculated there are several reasons to explain firstly the subjectivity on the importance of variables during the calibration process which means users often paid more attention to calibrating variables that were more important and need higher accuracy in an application such as grain yield kersebaum et al 2015 secondly end season variables like grain yield was usually more straightforward to measure accurately than in season physiological parameters which accounted highly for the precision of instruments therefore reducing the measurement error of in season variables would be beneficial to reducing prediction error and uncertainty the information provided here was useful to help increase modeling accuracy with better observation measurement in this study we explored the model uncertainty mainly derived from the calibration process data scarcity and data quality issues would cause difficulties in calibration seidel et al 2018 increasing the representativeness of experimental data and making the best use of existing data would help increase calibration efficiency while selecting observations from contrasting growth environments may lead to the most effective calibration he et al 2017a kersebaum et al 2015 seidel et al 2018 however the effectiveness of choosing calibration data from contrasting environments perhaps depends on the condition that the model was trying to simulate hence developing a systematic and standard protocol for model users is useful to improve calibration practices and eliminate the subjectivity effect seidel et al 2018 other sources of uncertainties like model structure and input data quality were not considered which also have a significant impact understanding the physiological mechanism of model structure will help improve model performance and evaluating the quality and suitability of observations will help assemble high quality datasets kersebaum et al 2015 maiorano et al 2017 wang et al 2017 therefore more efforts should be made by considering all the sources of uncertainties in the future to understand overall model performance 5 conclusion in this study we quantitatively evaluated the impact of oc on prediction error and uncertainty analysed decomposition information of prediction error using real datasets retrieved from field experiments results showed model uncertainty overshadowing model bias became the dominant source of overall prediction error when the variation of oc increased to an extent 14 5 in this study furthermore the variations of calibrated parameters prediction error and uncertainty mainly were higher in the high variation of oc than in the low variation of oc demonstrated by pssd vs psrep predictions and in season vs end season variables it emphasizes that the risks of high prediction error and uncertainty existed when calibration datasets were measured under different conditions than those model is trying to reproduce moreover we found that the responses of prediction error and uncertainty to the variations of oc depended on the conditions such as different sds in this study that the model simulated to some extent this reflects different strategies in choosing data for optimal calibration we recommend that efforts in uncertainty reduction should include quantitatively assessing the suitability of datasets for the purpose of calibration together with making specific calibration strategy based on the simulation targets our study proposed a practical method to quantificat the impact of oc on model prediction error and uncertainty which could be useful for quantitatively assessing the suitability of datasets using for model calibration according to the value of oc variation and a certain threshold and be adapted to different crops and ecological models on this basis we provided insights into how model prediction accuracy changed along oc variation extent in the context of process oriented model simulation however we could not reach a conclusion about the best practice for choosing calibration data due to the limitation of experimental data and model type as a future perspective more experimental data from different growth environments and cultivation practices should be involved in to get a general and targeted strategy for calibration data collection credit author statement the manuscript with the title effect of variation in the observations on the prediction

of the selected variables normalized root means square error nrmse has been widely used to quantify the relative simulation errors bouman et al 2001 he et al 2017 wang et al 2017 in the control file of this program nrmse values for five growth variables were set according to experts recommendations the nrmse was calculated as follows 1 nrmse 1 x i 1 n x i y i 2 n 100 where xi and yi were the paired observed and predicted values x was the average of all observations of xi and n was the number of observations 2 4 prediction scenarios three scenarios were set to evaluate the effect of variation of oc on prediction results including biomass lai and final grain yield i e prediction scenarios based on the calibration of replicates in each sowing date psrep prediction scenarios based on the calibration of average data of sowing dates pssd and control check scenarios ck the psrep evaluated the effect of oc with a low variation on prediction results by simulating a given sd i using each of the four sets of parameters derived from an individual oij of sd i fig 1 the pssd evaluated the effect of oc with a high variation on prediction results by simulating a given sd i using each of the five sets of parameters derived from an individual ok of sd k k i furthermore ck scenarios were performed with simulations of a given sd i using parameters derived from oi we assumed the nominal value of parameters in sd i is the calibrated parameters from oi which usually represents the optimized settings in the field study prediction results in psrep and pssd were compared with the simulation results from the corresponding sd i in ck the prediction error is defined as the discrepancy between predicted value and observation the overall prediction error was calculated as the difference between the output of the prediction scenarios and corresponding observations in this study overall prediction error was decomposed into model uncertainty and model bias as follows 2 m o pd o ck m o pd m o ck m o ck o ck model uncertainty model bias where mopd was the model output in the prediction scenario ock was the observation to be predicted and mock was the model output in the ck model uncertainty was the variation of prediction results arised from oc variation which was calculated as the difference between the output of the prediction scenarios and output of ck model bias was the simulation error when simulating with the nominal value of parameters which was calculated as the calibration error of ck the contribution of model uncertainty cmu and model bias cmb to the overall prediction error were assessed as follows 3 c mb m o ck o ck m o pd o ck 4 c mu m o pd m o ck m o pd o ck moreover the correlations between the model uncertainty and the variation of the observations and the correlations between overall prediction error and its two divisions were analysed using a linear regression model to compare the model uncertainty of different variables we calculated the relative changes of the predicted values to that of the ck rc pv which was calculated as follows 5 rc pv m o pd m o ck m o ck 100 analogously the relative changes in observations used for model calibration rc oc and calibrated parameters rc cp were calculated furthermore we defined prediction uncertainty as the variation of prediction errors the range of nrmse caused by oc variation was used to quantify the prediction uncertainty in this study palosuo et al 2011 the model uncertainty only relates to the variability of the predicted values while the prediction uncertainty concerns both the predicted values and the observations gao et al 2021 r program version 3 4 1 package plyr and ggplot2 was used for the calculations and figures 3 results 3 1 contribution of model uncertainty and model bias to prediction error for the prediction of biomass and grain yield in psrep the median cmb and median cmu were 0 71 0 98 and 0 02 0 29 respectively which indicated that model bias contributed more than model uncertainty to overall prediction error table 1 however model bias contributed less than model uncertainty in pssd with median cmb and median cmu were 0 21 0 50 and 0 50 0 79 respectively for lai prediction the major contribution to the overall prediction error was from model uncertainty in both psrep median cmu 0 93 and pssd median cmu 0 99 furthermore in the biomass predictions of psrep model bias explained more than 70 of the variations of overall prediction error with the coefficient of determination values r2 between model bias and overall prediction error being greater than 0 70 which indicated a strong correlation between them fig 2 on the contrary a strong correlation between model uncertainty and overall prediction error were observed with the r2 values being greater than 0 50 fig 3 these results revealed that the major contributing factor to overall prediction error could shift from model bias to model uncertainty when the variation of oc changed from about 4 2 psrep to about 14 5 pssd fig 4 3 2 effects of observations used for calibration on model uncertainties the relative changes of oc rc oc and predicted values rc pv are shown in fig 4 in psrep the mean value of rc oc was 4 2 and the median values ranged from 2 6 to 5 6 for all variables in pssd the mean value of rc oc was 14 5 and the median values ranged from 6 1 to 20 4 for all variables the results showed that oc variations were consistently lower among replicates of a given sd treatment than across different sds with the highest variation occurring in lai and the lowest in grain yield compared to the rc oc the mean values of rc pv in psrep and pssd were 4 6 and 15 9 respectively with median values and distribution ranges were approximate to that in rc oc for simulation variables fig 4 the model uncertainties were found to have the same distribution patterns as oc variations do furthermore correlations between the absolute variations in the observations and simulations were strong and positive especially for lai wlvg and yield with r2 values of 0 844 0 700 and 0 584 respectively fig a 2 these results implied that deviation of oc could cause changes in the model outputs at similar degrees of variation through the calibration process details about observations including rice phenology lai the biomass of different organs and grain yield were displayed in table a 2 3 3 impacts of observations used for calibration on prediction uncertainty the nrmses between the predicted and observed growth variables are presented for the scenarios of psrep fig 5 and pssd fig 6 the performance of the models was often evaluated as excellent good acceptable and poor based on the criteria of nrmse values being less than 10 between 10 and 20 between 20 and 30 and larger than 30 respectively chen et al 2022 confalonieri et al 2016a costa filho et al 2021 jamieson et al 1991 in ck scenarios all the average nrmse of six sds in wagt wlvg wst wso lai and grain yield were less than 15 which showed a high inherent simulation capability of the model however the prediction error and prediction uncertainty of growth variables were significantly affected by oc in psrep the nrmses across prediction scenarios were similar to that of ck fig 5 blue points vs red points but were larger than that of ck in pssd fig 6 blue points vs red points predictions with higher nrmse than that of ck accounted for 54 2 in psrep and 86 1 in pssd the ranges of nrmse for each growth variable are shown in figs 5 6 with blue bars across six sowing dates the ranges of nrmse for all the variables were higher in pssd 0 4 71 8 than that in psrep 0 04 26 8 the higher ones corresponding to higher oc variations the range of nrmse in pssd was largest in lai 4 9 71 8 and lowest in grain yield 0 4 22 7 it is worth noting that the highest and lowest variations of oc were also found in lai and grain yield respectively these results suggested that high oc variability could lead to a risk of reducing prediction accuracy as well increasing prediction uncertainty moreover the discrepancy in nrmse between prediction and calibration scenarios varied across six sds as well as the ranges of nrmse fig 6 which indicated a non uniform response of prediction error and uncertainty to oc variation under different conditions such as different sds in this study that model try to mimic 4 discussion model uncertainty from the model structure was usually compared in ensemble simulations of multiple models while the effects of model structure on prediction error within a model were seldom evaluated alderman et al 2016 waha et al 2015 wallach et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 this study separated overall prediction error into model bias and model uncertainty model bias reflects the inherent model capability related to its structure which is intrinsically an unavoidable source of prediction error harmel and smith 2007 model uncertainty raised from model inputs and calibration accuracy usually affected by many factors such as data source quality of observations calibration techniques and methods user subjectivity during calibration etc harmel and smith 2007 confalonieri et al 2016 a b using oryza v3 as a case study we found that model bias was the dominant factor for the overall prediction error in the predictions with low variation of oc table 1 however model uncertainty became the dominant source of overall prediction error when the variation of oc increased to an extent 14 5 in this study and model bias became a secondary source parameterization plays an important role in the accuracy of prediction results to understand the effect of parameters on model prediction errors many studies used sensitivity analyses with a series of generated data for each parameter to test model performance monod et al 2006 tan et al 2017 however little attention has been focused on the response of parameters to oc variation from field experiments confalonieri et al 2016a in this study we found that the variations of calibrated parameters and prediction error were lower in the low variation of oc psrep than in high variation of oc pssd in most cases table a 3 and figs 5 6 indicating that the variation of model output had a positive relationship with the range of parameter variation which was also found in the previous study tan et al 2017 in addition we found that the discrepancies of variation between psrep and pssd were diverse across all parameters involved in model calibration in reality it is difficult to detect how parameterization will affect model output through the calibration process due to parameter equifinality namely the same simulation result could be reached by multiple combinations of parameters which could mask the actual set of parameters relating to physiological processes he et al 2017 a b therefore more efforts are needed to understand the responses of parameters to oc and the responses of individual growth variables to different parameters in crop growth simulations the predictions of end season variables are usually more accurate than in season variables predictions artacho et al 2011 yuan et al 2017 many studies have shown the prediction accuracy of lai was worse than that of grain yield bouman et al 2006 yuan et al 2017 cao et al 2017 in our study model prediction outputs also had a similar trend figs 5 6 we found that the oc variations of in season variables were higher than that of end season variables leading to a higher prediction error we speculated there are several reasons to explain firstly the subjectivity on the importance of variables during the calibration process which means users often paid more attention to calibrating variables that were more important and need higher accuracy in an application such as grain yield kersebaum et al 2015 secondly end season variables like grain yield was usually more straightforward to measure accurately than in season physiological parameters which accounted highly for the precision of instruments therefore reducing the measurement error of in season variables would be beneficial to reducing prediction error and uncertainty the information provided here was useful to help increase modeling accuracy with better observation measurement in this study we explored the model uncertainty mainly derived from the calibration process data scarcity and data quality issues would cause difficulties in calibration seidel et al 2018 increasing the representativeness of experimental data and making the best use of existing data would help increase calibration efficiency while selecting observations from contrasting growth environments may lead to the most effective calibration he et al 2017a kersebaum et al 2015 seidel et al 2018 however the effectiveness of choosing calibration data from contrasting environments perhaps depends on the condition that the model was trying to simulate hence developing a systematic and standard protocol for model users is useful to improve calibration practices and eliminate the subjectivity effect seidel et al 2018 other sources of uncertainties like model structure and input data quality were not considered which also have a significant impact understanding the physiological mechanism of model structure will help improve model performance and evaluating the quality and suitability of observations will help assemble high quality datasets kersebaum et al 2015 maiorano et al 2017 wang et al 2017 therefore more efforts should be made by considering all the sources of uncertainties in the future to understand overall model performance 5 conclusion in this study we quantitatively evaluated the impact of oc on prediction error and uncertainty analysed decomposition information of prediction error using real datasets retrieved from field experiments results showed model uncertainty overshadowing model bias became the dominant source of overall prediction error when the variation of oc increased to an extent 14 5 in this study furthermore the variations of calibrated parameters prediction error and uncertainty mainly were higher in the high variation of oc than in the low variation of oc demonstrated by pssd vs psrep predictions and in season vs end season variables it emphasizes that the risks of high prediction error and uncertainty existed when calibration datasets were measured under different conditions than those model is trying to reproduce moreover we found that the responses of prediction error and uncertainty to the variations of oc depended on the conditions such as different sds in this study that the model simulated to some extent this reflects different strategies in choosing data for optimal calibration we recommend that efforts in uncertainty reduction should include quantitatively assessing the suitability of datasets for the purpose of calibration together with making specific calibration strategy based on the simulation targets our study proposed a practical method to quantificat the impact of oc on model prediction error and uncertainty which could be useful for quantitatively assessing the suitability of datasets using for model calibration according to the value of oc variation and a certain threshold and be adapted to different crops and ecological models on this basis we provided insights into how model prediction accuracy changed along oc variation extent in the context of process oriented model simulation however we could not reach a conclusion about the best practice for choosing calibration data due to the limitation of experimental data and model type as a future perspective more experimental data from different growth environments and cultivation practices should be involved in to get a general and targeted strategy for calibration data collection credit author statement the manuscript with the title effect of variation in the observations on the prediction

24286,plastic contamination has been receiving considerable attention during the last few decades although some models could simulate transport and fate of plastic debris in freshwater systems complete model for the whole picture of plastic dynamics on basin scale has yet to be established in the present study the authors extended process based eco hydrology models nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology and nice bgc biogeochemical cycle to link them with plastic debris model and applied to all of the 109 first class class a river basins throughout japan new model included advection dispersion diffusion settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature these processes could help to evaluate effect of mismanaged plastic waste mpw and point sources tyres personal care products dust and laundry on spatio temporal dynamics of macro and micro plastics there the model showed simulated hydrologic cycle was generally in good agreement with observed one in contrast simulated value of annual averaged nutrient transports was overestimated in comparison with observed value averaged over non flood periods sensitivity analysis of micro plastic transport to various factors also implied effects of degradation would not be negligible under some conditions generally large amounts of plastic flowed out of some limited rivers tone kiso yodo and ara rivers with a large proportion of macro plastic flux in comparison with micro plastic flux further scenario analysis quantified the total plastic flux varied according to efficiency of micro plastic removal in wastewater treatment plants wwtp and density of plastic and was estimated as within the range 1 100 3 500 ton yr relatively similar to that of existing values it was also clarified only a limited proportion of plastics discharged onto land flow out into the ocean intensively during rainfall seasons these results help to quantify impacts of plastic waste on biosphere and may aid development of solutions and measures to reduce plastic input to the ocean graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic debris eco hydrology model river basin mismanaged plastic waste data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic pollution is considered to be one of today s main environmental problems and such pollutants in streams rivers and oceans pose potential risks to human health and the environment siegfried et al 2017 in particular plastic accumulation on riverbanks deltas coastlines and the ocean surface is rapidly increasing and it is estimated that 60 of the plastics ever manufactured have been discarded in landfill or in the natural environment meijer et al 2021 on the basis of size plastic waste can be roughly categorized as macro plastic 5 mm or micro plastic 5 mm and the latter is sometimes further categorized partially as nano plastic 100 nm micro plastic is also divided into primary intentionally manufactured as small and secondary arising through decomposition fragmentation and degradation of larger pieces micro plastics according to origin siegfried et al 2017 once plastic is released into the environment it is impossible to remove and remains indefinitely previous studies on the origin and fate of plastic waste in freshwater systems have suggested that land derived plastics are one of the main sources of marine plastic pollution thompson et al 2004 as a result of either direct emission from coastal areas jambeck et al 2015 or by transport via rivers lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 although jambeck et al 2015 were the first to estimate the mass of land based plastic waste entering the global ocean they did not consider plastic waste from inland water or its size class subsequent studies lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 estimated the distribution of global riverine emissions of plastic into the ocean by using empirical indicators representative of waste generation mismanaged plastic waste mpw inside a river basin recently using a probabilistic approach meijer et al 2021 proposed a more accurate form of analysis to account for the spatial distribution of plastic waste generation lebreton and andrady 2019 and climatological geographical differences within river basins they estimated that more than 1000 rivers account for 80 of global riverine plastic emissions into the ocean which range between 0 8 and 2 7 million metric tons per year on a regional scale only a few studies have evaluated the concentration and riverine flux of plastics in japan kataoka et al 2019 nihei et al 2020 such assessment of the fate and transport of plastics would also be necessary for realization of the osaka blue ocean vision shared at the g20 osaka summit in 2019 ministry of foreign affairs of japan 2019 over the last decade there has been great progress in modelling the fate and transport of plastics kooi et al 2018 classified plastic debris models for freshwater systems into four categories emission based mass balance global multimedia and spatio temporally explicit models boucher et al 2020 have summarized the previous development of science based metrics for measurement of the leakage and circularity of plastics in particular the global and spatially explicit model is powerful for estimating the riverine export of plastics to coastal seas praetorius et al 2012 quik et al 2015 nizzetto et al 2016 besseling et al 2017 siegfried et al 2017 van wijnen et al 2019 whitehead et al 2021 some of these studies siegfried et al 2017 van wijnen et al 2019 strokal et al 2021 adapted a process orientated model to both continental and global scales by extending an existing non dynamic nutrient export model however the fate of micro plastics is also dependant on their size density shape and polymer type factors that were not included in these previous global analyses of generic material jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 nizzetto et al 2016 incorporated the settling and resuspension of micro plastics to estimate their retention in rivers by extending the in stream sediment model used in a previous study lazar et al 2010 they conducted sensitivity analysis of the size and density of micro plastics in fluxes by using this spatially explicit model of inca contaminants whitehead et al 2021 also used the same model to simulate the micro plastic mass loads of four particle size classes in various reaches of the thames river it is expected that the accuracy of global or regional emissions estimated using the above probabilistic approach meijer et al 2021 would be improved by using the spatially explicit model unice et al 2019 these models will help to identify the hotspots and sinks of plastic pollution and resolve the source flux sink nexus within river basins windsor et al 2019 because most of the above plastic debris models are based on analogy with sediment models for inland waters it is questionable whether these models are reasonably adaptable for modelling the dynamics of plastics with various sizes densities shapes polymer types and contact angles nizzetto et al 2016 waldschlager and schüttrumpf 2019 transport of micro plastics in river ecosystems is either gravity driven vertical transport or occurs through settling horizontal transport kumar et al 2021 cowger et al 2021 modified the rouse profile of vertical concentration to include all traditional domains of transport bed load settling suspended load and wash load as well as additional domains specific to low density materials with increasing velocities in water rising suspended load and surface load this revealed that the vertical profile of low density plastics such as polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and polystyrene ps under the predominance of wind shear differs considerably from the original rouse profile of natural sediment liu et al 2021 particle size generally appears to be a more sensitive parameter influencing micro plastic transport and retention efficiency because of its wide range across several orders of magnitude although there is obviously a sharp change in parameter sensitivity when the density approaches that of water nizzetto et al 2016 it is also important to model the transport of plastics in air water and through soil koutnik et al 2021 these factors need to be considered when assessing the fate and transport of plastics in various basins over scales ranging from local regional to continental global one of the authors has developed a process based model coupling eco hydrology with the biogeochemical cycle national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice bgc nakayama 2016 2017a 2017b incorporating complex terrestrial aquatic linkages in the hydrologic biogeochemical cycle nice bgc can simulate nonlinear interactions between hydrologic geomorphic and ecological processes water heat sediment nutrient and carbon cycles etc in the present study the process based nice bgc was extended to link it with a plastic debris engineered materials model for freshwater systems and applied to all 109 first class class a river basins in the whole of japan fig 1 a the new model included advection dispersion diffusion settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature but assumed no interaction with suspended matter heteroaggregation resuspension biofouling or wind effects for model simplification the authors also assumed micro plastics to be pure and totally inert polymers with spherical particles of constant size and density on the basis of this background two basic issues were addressed i how does emission change relative to differences in the size and density of mismanaged plastic waste mpw ii how do hydraulic structures and water treatment plants affect riverine emissions of plastic into the ocean in order to clarify these issues nice bgc simulated how mpw meijer et al 2021 and point sources such as tyres personal care products pcps dust and laundry in the entire country are transported from land to river and finally to the ocean establishment of complete model for the whole picture of plastic dynamics on basin scale becomes a big step forward the results are also important for predicting and estimating the change of plastic dynamics under climate change in the future these results help to quantify the impacts of plastic waste on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and may be useful for devising solutions and measures for reduction of plastic input to the ocean 2 materials and methods 2 1 coupling of process based nice with biogeochemical cycle models nice bgc the original nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology comprises complex sub compartments such as the surface hydrology of hillslope and stream flows a land surface model including urban and crop processes a groundwater model a regional atmospheric model a sediment and nutrient mass transport model and a vegetation succession model nakayama and watanabe 2004 nakayama 2014 2015 in order to fill the current eco hydrology gap the author has further developed a new model in which the original nice is coupled with various biogeochemical cycle models nice bgc nakayama 2016 2017a 2017b fig s1 in supporting information each submodel offers iterative simulation in the most efficient way by combining on line and off line modes on line data input output through i o memory off line data input output through file this means that the newly developed model incorporates the connectivity of the biogeochemical cycle accompanied by the hydrologic cycle between surface water and groundwater hillslopes and river networks and other intermediate regions nakayama 2016 recently the author modified nice bgc to include the effect of reservoirs nakayama and pelletier 2018 and two parameters soil organic carbon and carbon emission from the intermediate soil pool to improve the accuracy of long term simulation nakayama 2020 2 2 modelling the fate and transport of macro and micro plastics in land and inland water by extension of nice bgc in this study nice bgc nakayama 2016 2017a 2017b was extended in order to model the fate and transport of macro and micro plastic in land and water fig 2 the new model included advection dispersion diffusion settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature but assumed no interaction with suspended matter heteroaggregation praetorius et al 2012 resuspension waldschlager and schüttrumpf 2019 biofouling kooi et al 2017 or wind effects thus the model can simulate the hydrograph for plastics transport with various shear stresses during storm events as proposed by kumar et al 2021 for model simplification the authors also assumed that micro plastics are pure and totally inert polymers with spherical particles of constant size and density the transport of plastic on a hillslope was simulated in equations a1 a9 except a4 in supporting information a because equation a4 assumes the resuspension rate when a riverbed is under equilibrium conditions and the particle size distribution is uniform it is difficult to apply this formula directly to plastic it is actually difficult to grasp the heterogeneous distribution of settled and deposited plastic on hillslopes although some studies have evaluated the erosion behaviour of micro plastic particles in comparison to sediments waldschlager and schüttrumpf 2019 for model simplification we also assume that this plastic is negligible in comparison to discharged plastic and that resuspension is zero on hillslopes after simulation of plastic transport on a hillslope the authors used the estimated rate of conversion of macro plastics to micro plastics 3 yr in the same way as van wijnen et al 2019 with the extension of the conversion rate employed by jambeck et al 2015 fig 2 nice bgc simulates the transport of plastic in a river channel by extending qual2kw pelletier et al 2006 macro and micro plastics become buried through settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature in addition to advection dispersion and diffusion the terms of sources and sinks for the constituent s due to reactions and mass transfer mechanisms can be added to the above equation a10 in supporting information a 1 s p m a c v p m a c h p m a c k p m a c t p m a c α p m a

temperature dependant plastic dissolution rates d and αpmac and αpmic are the light efficiency factors respectively we assume that the deterioration due to light can be modelled as a first order temperature dependant decay and the deterioration rate ke due to light is based on the beer lambert law we also assume that there is no interaction with suspended matter heteroaggregation resuspension biofouling or the effects of wind furthermore we assume that the deterioration of macro plastics due to light and temperature shows transition to micro plastics and this disappearance term in eq 1 was added to eq 2 2 3 model input data the input data at various spatial resolutions were prepared and arranged to calculate a spatially averaged 0 1 x 0 1 grid about 9 11 km resolution using the spatial analyst tools in arcgis v10 3 software for a simulation of japan as a whole fig 1 and table 1 elevation land cover soil texture vegetation type river networks lakes and wetlands reservoirs and dams and geological structures were categorized on the basis of the global and japanese datasets to create the grid data from point polyline and polygon data for different sources with different spatial resolutions in a reasonable way overlay analysis was conducted using gis tools intersect union and identity esri 2019 the authors also subdivided the agricultural regions of glc2000 into major crops in mirca2000 portmann et al 2010 and the fao crop definition leff et al 2004 table 1 the irrigation type surface water groundwater and other and irrigation water use derived using the global datasets were also defined in the same way as in the author s previous study nakayama 2020 the total nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus consumptions for each crop were calculated to obtain the totals for n and p fertilizer n and p manure and n deposition using arcgis software in order to merge the data with mirca2000 in each 5 arc minute grid 10 km this confirmed that the calculated total consumption of each nutrient was within the range of the previous data bouwman et al 2009 therefore for the nice bgc simulation the authors used the spatially distributed data for fertilizer and manure application for each crop thereafter although data for plastics are scarce the authors used some data to simulate the plastic debris for japan as a whole population data at 250 m resolution was obtained from the japanese census in 2015 japanese government statistics 2021 wastewater treatment plants wwtp at 2185 locations ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit 2013 as point sources and mpw at 1 km resolution lebreton and andrady 2019 as a diffuse source table 1 2 4 plastic generation at point and non point sources and removal at wwtp some previous studies of plastic dynamics on a global scale lebreton and andrady 2019 strokal et al 2021 lebreton and andrady 2019 have predicted future plastic waste generation by considering population and gdp growth rates per country these proposed three scenarios a business as usual b improvement of waste management and c reduction of plastic use and improvement of waste management this approach is effective for evaluation of future mpw production on a regional scale strokal et al 2021 developed five scenarios with different levels of urbanization and wastewater treatment rates by considering different levels of socio economic challenge for mitigation and adaptation as five shared socio economic pathways ssps this approach is also useful for assessing the impact of urbanization on future river pollution by adopting a multi pollutant approach in the uk whitehead et al 2021 also considered three scenarios for wastewater effluent sewage sludge application and mitigation in the basin of the thames river table 2 summarizes the per capita emission of macro plastics and micro plastics into rivers determined in previous studies siegfried et al 2017 van wijnen et al 2019 boucher et al 2020 strokal et al 2021 generally micro plastics at point sources are considered to originate from four sources personal care products pcps laundry fibres car tyre wear and fragmentation of macro plastics we estimated the fluxes of micro plastics by multiplying these per capita emissions and their population distribution for each catchment flow into wwtp in the nice bgc simulation table 1 for estimating the variations of total flux in japan as a whole we used the removal efficiency of micro plastic in wwtp 99 97 and 95 higher removal efficiency for almost all secondary and tertiary treatments in japan and the density of the plastic 1010 0 1001 0 and 1000 5 kg m3 the lower density plastics pe pp and ps are overwhelmingly present in japanese rivers in the model based on previous studies for japan kataoka et al 2019 nihei et al 2020 and other developed countries siegfried et al 2017 van wijnen et al 2019 strokal et al 2021 2 5 running the simulation and verification the simulation area in all of the 109 first class river basins throughout japan was 26 0 wide by 22 0 long in longitude latitude coordinates fig 1 the nice simulation of eco hydrological processes was performed at 0 1 x 0 1 resolution in the horizontal direction and in 20 layers in the vertical direction supporting information b simulations were performed with a time step of δt 1 h for 2 years during 2014 2015 after a 6 month warm up period until a time varying equilibrium the periods of some input data such as vegetation type and land cover do not cover the simulation period table 1 subsequently nice bgc simulation for terrestrial ecosystems was conducted at the same spatial resolution with a time step of δt 1 day for the same period by inputting some of the results simulated by nice iteratively after calculating the daily averaged data from 1 hourly data supporting information b the authors used previous data ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit 2013 for per capita emission of micro plastics into rivers pcps dusts laundries and tyres and removal efficiency in wwtp siegfried et al 2017 as a point source fig 2 and table 2 the model also simulated outflow of macro plastics originated from mpw lebreton and andrady 2019 as a diffuse source fig 1f then nice bgc simulation for aquatic ecosystems was conducted by inputting the simulated results for land to a stream network model with a time step of δt 0 70 min to ensure the stability of the model the simulation was conducted for the whole of japan in the same way as the author s previous study in the global scale nakayama 2017a where the hydrologic and nutrient cycles in the world s major rivers were simulated and verified within the range of previous datasets and materials as far as possible fig s2 in supporting information the results yielded quantitative measures of model performance in terms of reproducing the seasonality and inter annual variability in nutrient and carbon fluxes as described previously by nakayama 2020 2022 these mean the extension of nice bgc coupled with plastic debris model in the present study would to be a better choice for simulating the fate and transport of plastic waste in a basin scale as described below in detailed 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the hydrologic cycle in first class class a river basins in the whole of japan the authors evaluated the hydrologic cycle in first class river basins in the whole of japan fig 3 shows the simulated results for surface runoff in major rivers with large basin area and long river channel amongst the first class rivers no 28 tone river no 36 shinano river no 54 kisoriver and no 62 yodo river in fig 1a during 2014 2015 the results show that the intermediate flow was almost constant fig 3c in comparison to the surface runoff fig 3b which implies that surface runoff is intensive during rainfall events and greatly contributes to the outflow of plastic it is also apparent that surface runoff is limited in small river basins but cannot be ignored because it is difficult to validate the hillslope runoff with almost no observation data the authors compared the simulated annual averaged values for discharge nitrogen and phosphorus transport with the previous observation data kataoka et al 2019 ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2021a for first class river basins fig 4 although the simulated discharges are slightly underestimated relative to the observed values particularly in rivers with snow areas no 3 ishikari river and no 17 kitakami river no 35 agano river no 36 shinano river in fig 1a the simulated results are generally in good agreement with observed ones fig 4a transports of nutrients simulated by the time series for the entire calculation period during 2014 2015 red circle in the figures are overestimated in comparison with the observed values fig 4b c because observation of concentrations was conducted only in the non flood periods kataoka et al 2019 the simulated values averaged only for the base flow of rivers are within the range of those in the observed values blue triangle in the figures the hydrologic regimes of both baseflow and stormflow events are important for remobilization of plastic particles in inland waters drummond et al 2020 3 2 analysis of the sensitivity of micro plastic transport to various factors the authors analysed the sensitivity of micro plastic concentration to various factors in the downstream stretch of the tone river in summer june 1 to july 20 2014 fig 5 it was found that the concentration of micro plastics was greatly affected by their particle size and density which determine the settling velocity nizzetto et al 2016 in particular almost all plastic particles with a density lower than water polypropylene pp are more buoyant than those with a higher density polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet fig 5b the simulated value was generally within the range of previous observations for limited non flood periods in the same river micro plastic concentration between 0 03 and 2 36 μg l kataoka et al 2019 nihei et al 2020 the simulated result also agreed with previous work showing that micro plastics smaller than 0 2 mm would be poorly retained in the thames river uk and would eventually be conveyed to the marine environment nizzetto et al 2016 whitehead et al 2021 the simulation also showed that the effects of degradation i e a decrease in concentration resulting from both water temperature and uv irradiation in fig 5c would not be negligible because there is a great variation with these two values this effect is particularly predominant under some conditions for example in hot and cold water and with stronger uv irradiation in summer 3 3 impact of plastic density and wwtp on riverine export of plastics into the ocean the model simulated the total plastic flux to the ocean for japan as a whole fig 6 generally large amounts of plastic flow out of some limited rivers such as the tone no 28 kiso no 54 yodo no 62 and ara rivers no 29 where there is a large proportion of macro plastic flux in comparison with micro plastic flux fig 6b although the modelled results for micro plastic flux are a little overestimated in comparison with previous observations kataoka et al 2019 in some rivers fig 6a the analysis of this scenario also shows that the total flux for japan as a whole varies according to the removal efficiency of micro plastics in wwtp 99 97 and 95 and the density of the plastic 1010 0 1001 0 and 1000 5 kg m3 fig 6c the simulated flux is within the range 1100 3500 ton yr with 1395 ton yr in case ab removal efficiency 99 and density of plastic 1001 0 kg m3 this result is relatively within the range of previously determined values i e 1835 ton yr meijer et al 2021 and 210 4976 ton yr nihei et al 2020 this shows that only limited plastics are discharged intensively to land flows out into the ocean during rainfall seasons in agreement with a previous study indicating that nearly 99 of micro plastics are deposited during their transport to coastal regions koutnik et al 2021 it will be further necessary to improve the accuracy of the modelled results by validation of observations 4 discussion 4 1 limitations of the present analysis and assessment nice bgc simulates the retention and degradation of plastics in inland water by including advection dispersion diffusion settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature figs 5 and 6 this is a great improvement from previous studies that did not account for remobilisation or burial of micro plastic particles siegfried et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 and assumed a constant retention factor and transport of a constant fraction of mpw to rivers van wijnen et al 2019 however instead of assuming plastics to be spherical particles with a constant size and density as described in equation a9 in supporting information a there is a need to simplify micro plastics by fully defining them in terms of a three dimensional probability distribution taking into account size shape and density kooi and koelmans 2019 in addition larger plastics have a greater surface area causing them to float more easily in the surface layer liu et al 2021 while the higher specific surface area of smaller plastics would cause their rapid sinking because of biofouling kooi et al 2017 furthermore large sized plastics have higher stability and show less aggregation in aquatic environments than small sized particles future advances in the uncertainty model would greatly contribute to the elucidation of the transport and the retention of macro and micro plastics in rivers together with further field surveys and laboratory experiments about plastic degradation through photodegradation temperature physical abrasion biodegradation and weathering fig 5 the detailed evaluation of the fate and transport of plastics originating from a diffuse source mpw and point sources tyres pcps dust and laundry in this study fig 2 and table 2 may also be of relevance in terms of the size and spatial distribution of plastics in inland water in particular the percentage of the sewage treatment population in japan was 92 1 in 2021 and that in tokyo was the highest at 99 8 ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2021b it will be essential to quantify in more detail the removal of micro plastics in wwtp entering from surrounding sewage systems the outflow of plastics such as microcapsules from farmland and the amount of micro plastics in rivers originating from macro plastics that have degraded on land van wijnen et al 2019 development of optimal systems for management of emissions on land and practices such as stormwater wastewater treatments could also minimize dissemination of plastics into the environment nizzetto et al 2016 koutnik et al 2021 fig 6 it will be necessary to quantify the sources sinks fluxes and fates of plastics on a basin scale and to improve environmentally relevant dose response relationships for different organisms and effective pathways windsor et al 2019 4 2 towards understanding of plastic dynamics in regulated rivers under climate change the simulated result also demonstrated the need to understand the fluxes and the hysteresis of pollutants in rivers under flood conditions by making observations that include flood periods kataoka et al 2019 as the annual flux observed only in normal water is underestimated by about one fifth fig 4 this will be further requested in the future because extreme events such as floods and droughts might increase further with climate change the assumption that artificial barriers such as dams reservoirs and gates act as sinks for all plastic particles is also conservative fig 1 because the sediment trap efficiency of these hydraulic structures may depend upon several factors lebreton et al 2017 drummond et al 2020 have also evaluated the influence of hyporheic exchange on micro plastic transport and fate in aquatic environments thus helping to overcome underestimation of the deposition retention and long term accumulation of micro plastics in streambed sediments they pointed out that micro plastic retention may be overestimated and that its fate will be inaccurately represented in rivers without considering baseflow remobilisation figs 3 and 4 recent study shows that previous studies about riverine plastic outflows based on the concept of mpw were substantially greater than reported field data and advocates the need for robust model using the human development index hdi as the main predictor mai et al 2020 from another point of view mpw lebreton and andrady 2019 used in the present study fig 1f did not include the effect of waste plastic trade flow between japan and abroad japan was some of top exporting countries of waste plastic around 2015 and some countries such as china imported this waste plastic this situation changed greatly afterwards with the establishment of basel convention united nations 2019 because some importing countries introduced import regulations mainly for the purpose of environmental protection so it is powerful to combine nice with social system method such as material flow analysis for assessing emissions into the environment for future studies under climate change fig 2 anyway the present study is an important step not only for qualification of processes but identification of hierarchy of drivers in various river catchments development of framework for reversing degradation of global water resources and especially their pollution with plastic might be powerful for achieving sustainable development goals sdg unesco 2022 5 conclusions process based nice bgc was extended to couple with plastic debris engineered materials model for freshwater systems and applied it to all the first class class a river basins in entire japan 109 river basins the new model was constructed to include as many processes related to plastic dynamics in biosphere as possible applicable to regional and basin scales advection dispersion diffusion settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature nice bgc simulated how mismanaged plastic waste mpw and point sources such as tyres personal care products pcps dust and laundry in the entire country are transported from land to river and finally to the ocean the simulated result quantified large amounts of plastic flowed out of some limited rivers intensively during rainfall seasons and that macro plastic flux accounts for a larger proportion than micro plastic flux there although scenario analysis quantified the total flux varied according to some factors and was estimated as within the range of existing studies it is further necessary to minimize errors and uncertainties by using more accurate more long term and more observations these results help to quantify the impacts of plastic waste on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and find solutions and measures to reduce plastic input to the ocean credit authorship contribution statement tadanobu nakayama conceptualization methodology software validation

24286,plastic contamination has been receiving considerable attention during the last few decades although some models could simulate transport and fate of plastic debris in freshwater systems complete model for the whole picture of plastic dynamics on basin scale has yet to be established in the present study the authors extended process based eco hydrology models nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology and nice bgc biogeochemical cycle to link them with plastic debris model and applied to all of the 109 first class class a river basins throughout japan new model included advection dispersion diffusion settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature these processes could help to evaluate effect of mismanaged plastic waste mpw and point sources tyres personal care products dust and laundry on spatio temporal dynamics of macro and micro plastics there the model showed simulated hydrologic cycle was generally in good agreement with observed one in contrast simulated value of annual averaged nutrient transports was overestimated in comparison with observed value averaged over non flood periods sensitivity analysis of micro plastic transport to various factors also implied effects of degradation would not be negligible under some conditions generally large amounts of plastic flowed out of some limited rivers tone kiso yodo and ara rivers with a large proportion of macro plastic flux in comparison with micro plastic flux further scenario analysis quantified the total plastic flux varied according to efficiency of micro plastic removal in wastewater treatment plants wwtp and density of plastic and was estimated as within the range 1 100 3 500 ton yr relatively similar to that of existing values it was also clarified only a limited proportion of plastics discharged onto land flow out into the ocean intensively during rainfall seasons these results help to quantify impacts of plastic waste on biosphere and may aid development of solutions and measures to reduce plastic input to the ocean graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic debris eco hydrology model river basin mismanaged plastic waste data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic pollution is considered to be one of today s main environmental problems and such pollutants in streams rivers and oceans pose potential risks to human health and the environment siegfried et al 2017 in particular plastic accumulation on riverbanks deltas coastlines and the ocean surface is rapidly increasing and it is estimated that 60 of the plastics ever manufactured have been discarded in landfill or in the natural environment meijer et al 2021 on the basis of size plastic waste can be roughly categorized as macro plastic 5 mm or micro plastic 5 mm and the latter is sometimes further categorized partially as nano plastic 100 nm micro plastic is also divided into primary intentionally manufactured as small and secondary arising through decomposition fragmentation and degradation of larger pieces micro plastics according to origin siegfried et al 2017 once plastic is released into the environment it is impossible to remove and remains indefinitely previous studies on the origin and fate of plastic waste in freshwater systems have suggested that land derived plastics are one of the main sources of marine plastic pollution thompson et al 2004 as a result of either direct emission from coastal areas jambeck et al 2015 or by transport via rivers lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 although jambeck et al 2015 were the first to estimate the mass of land based plastic waste entering the global ocean they did not consider plastic waste from inland water or its size class subsequent studies lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 estimated the distribution of global riverine emissions of plastic into the ocean by using empirical indicators representative of waste generation mismanaged plastic waste mpw inside a river basin recently using a probabilistic approach meijer et al 2021 proposed a more accurate form of analysis to account for the spatial distribution of plastic waste generation lebreton and andrady 2019 and climatological geographical differences within river basins they estimated that more than 1000 rivers account for 80 of global riverine plastic emissions into the ocean which range between 0 8 and 2 7 million metric tons per year on a regional scale only a few studies have evaluated the concentration and riverine flux of plastics in japan kataoka et al 2019 nihei et al 2020 such assessment of the fate and transport of plastics would also be necessary for realization of the osaka blue ocean vision shared at the g20 osaka summit in 2019 ministry of foreign affairs of japan 2019 over the last decade there has been great progress in modelling the fate and transport of plastics kooi et al 2018 classified plastic debris models for freshwater systems into four categories emission based mass balance global multimedia and spatio temporally explicit models boucher et al 2020 have summarized the previous development of science based metrics for measurement of the leakage and circularity of plastics in particular the global and spatially explicit model is powerful for estimating the riverine export of plastics to coastal seas praetorius et al 2012 quik et al 2015 nizzetto et al 2016 besseling et al 2017 siegfried et al 2017 van wijnen et al 2019 whitehead et al 2021 some of these studies siegfried et al 2017 van wijnen et al 2019 strokal et al 2021 adapted a process orientated model to both continental and global scales by extending an existing non dynamic nutrient export model however the fate of micro plastics is also dependant on their size density shape and polymer type factors that were not included in these previous global analyses of generic material jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 nizzetto et al 2016 incorporated the settling and resuspension of micro plastics to estimate their retention in rivers by extending the in stream sediment model used in a previous study lazar et al 2010 they conducted sensitivity analysis of the size and density of micro plastics in fluxes by using this spatially explicit model of inca contaminants whitehead et al 2021 also used the same model to simulate the micro plastic mass loads of four particle size classes in various reaches of the thames river it is expected that the accuracy of global or regional emissions estimated using the above probabilistic approach meijer et al 2021 would be improved by using the spatially explicit model unice et al 2019 these models will help to identify the hotspots and sinks of plastic pollution and resolve the source flux sink nexus within river basins windsor et al 2019 because most of the above plastic debris models are based on analogy with sediment models for inland waters it is questionable whether these models are reasonably adaptable for modelling the dynamics of plastics with various sizes densities shapes polymer types and contact angles nizzetto et al 2016 waldschlager and schüttrumpf 2019 transport of micro plastics in river ecosystems is either gravity driven vertical transport or occurs through settling horizontal transport kumar et al 2021 cowger et al 2021 modified the rouse profile of vertical concentration to include all traditional domains of transport bed load settling suspended load and wash load as well as additional domains specific to low density materials with increasing velocities in water rising suspended load and surface load this revealed that the vertical profile of low density plastics such as polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and polystyrene ps under the predominance of wind shear differs considerably from the original rouse profile of natural sediment liu et al 2021 particle size generally appears to be a more sensitive parameter influencing micro plastic transport and retention efficiency because of its wide range across several orders of magnitude although there is obviously a sharp change in parameter sensitivity when the density approaches that of water nizzetto et al 2016 it is also important to model the transport of plastics in air water and through soil koutnik et al 2021 these factors need to be considered when assessing the fate and transport of plastics in various basins over scales ranging from local regional to continental global one of the authors has developed a process based model coupling eco hydrology with the biogeochemical cycle national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice bgc nakayama 2016 2017a 2017b incorporating complex terrestrial aquatic linkages in the hydrologic biogeochemical cycle nice bgc can simulate nonlinear interactions between hydrologic geomorphic and ecological processes water heat sediment nutrient and carbon cycles etc in the present study the process based nice bgc was extended to link it with a plastic debris engineered materials model for freshwater systems and applied to all 109 first class class a river basins in the whole of japan fig 1 a the new model included advection dispersion diffusion settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature but assumed no interaction with suspended matter heteroaggregation resuspension biofouling or wind effects for model simplification the authors also assumed micro plastics to be pure and totally inert polymers with spherical particles of constant size and density on the basis of this background two basic issues were addressed i how does emission change relative to differences in the size and density of mismanaged plastic waste mpw ii how do hydraulic structures and water treatment plants affect riverine emissions of plastic into the ocean in order to clarify these issues nice bgc simulated how mpw meijer et al 2021 and point sources such as tyres personal care products pcps dust and laundry in the entire country are transported from land to river and finally to the ocean establishment of complete model for the whole picture of plastic dynamics on basin scale becomes a big step forward the results are also important for predicting and estimating the change of plastic dynamics under climate change in the future these results help to quantify the impacts of plastic waste on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and may be useful for devising solutions and measures for reduction of plastic input to the ocean 2 materials and methods 2 1 coupling of process based nice with biogeochemical cycle models nice bgc the original nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology comprises complex sub compartments such as the surface hydrology of hillslope and stream flows a land surface model including urban and crop processes a groundwater model a regional atmospheric model a sediment and nutrient mass transport model and a vegetation succession model nakayama and watanabe 2004 nakayama 2014 2015 in order to fill the current eco hydrology gap the author has further developed a new model in which the original nice is coupled with various biogeochemical cycle models nice bgc nakayama 2016 2017a 2017b fig s1 in supporting information each submodel offers iterative simulation in the most efficient way by combining on line and off line modes on line data input output through i o memory off line data input output through file this means that the newly developed model incorporates the connectivity of the biogeochemical cycle accompanied by the hydrologic cycle between surface water and groundwater hillslopes and river networks and other intermediate regions nakayama 2016 recently the author modified nice bgc to include the effect of reservoirs nakayama and pelletier 2018 and two parameters soil organic carbon and carbon emission from the intermediate soil pool to improve the accuracy of long term simulation nakayama 2020 2 2 modelling the fate and transport of macro and micro plastics in land and inland water by extension of nice bgc in this study nice bgc nakayama 2016 2017a 2017b was extended in order to model the fate and transport of macro and micro plastic in land and water fig 2 the new model included advection dispersion diffusion settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature but assumed no interaction with suspended matter heteroaggregation praetorius et al 2012 resuspension waldschlager and schüttrumpf 2019 biofouling kooi et al 2017 or wind effects thus the model can simulate the hydrograph for plastics transport with various shear stresses during storm events as proposed by kumar et al 2021 for model simplification the authors also assumed that micro plastics are pure and totally inert polymers with spherical particles of constant size and density the transport of plastic on a hillslope was simulated in equations a1 a9 except a4 in supporting information a because equation a4 assumes the resuspension rate when a riverbed is under equilibrium conditions and the particle size distribution is uniform it is difficult to apply this formula directly to plastic it is actually difficult to grasp the heterogeneous distribution of settled and deposited plastic on hillslopes although some studies have evaluated the erosion behaviour of micro plastic particles in comparison to sediments waldschlager and schüttrumpf 2019 for model simplification we also assume that this plastic is negligible in comparison to discharged plastic and that resuspension is zero on hillslopes after simulation of plastic transport on a hillslope the authors used the estimated rate of conversion of macro plastics to micro plastics 3 yr in the same way as van wijnen et al 2019 with the extension of the conversion rate employed by jambeck et al 2015 fig 2 nice bgc simulates the transport of plastic in a river channel by extending qual2kw pelletier et al 2006 macro and micro plastics become buried through settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature in addition to advection dispersion and diffusion the terms of sources and sinks for the constituent s due to reactions and mass transfer mechanisms can be added to the above equation a10 in supporting information a 1 s p m a c v p m a c h p m a c k p m a c t p m a c α p m a

temperature dependant plastic dissolution rates d and αpmac and αpmic are the light efficiency factors respectively we assume that the deterioration due to light can be modelled as a first order temperature dependant decay and the deterioration rate ke due to light is based on the beer lambert law we also assume that there is no interaction with suspended matter heteroaggregation resuspension biofouling or the effects of wind furthermore we assume that the deterioration of macro plastics due to light and temperature shows transition to micro plastics and this disappearance term in eq 1 was added to eq 2 2 3 model input data the input data at various spatial resolutions were prepared and arranged to calculate a spatially averaged 0 1 x 0 1 grid about 9 11 km resolution using the spatial analyst tools in arcgis v10 3 software for a simulation of japan as a whole fig 1 and table 1 elevation land cover soil texture vegetation type river networks lakes and wetlands reservoirs and dams and geological structures were categorized on the basis of the global and japanese datasets to create the grid data from point polyline and polygon data for different sources with different spatial resolutions in a reasonable way overlay analysis was conducted using gis tools intersect union and identity esri 2019 the authors also subdivided the agricultural regions of glc2000 into major crops in mirca2000 portmann et al 2010 and the fao crop definition leff et al 2004 table 1 the irrigation type surface water groundwater and other and irrigation water use derived using the global datasets were also defined in the same way as in the author s previous study nakayama 2020 the total nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus consumptions for each crop were calculated to obtain the totals for n and p fertilizer n and p manure and n deposition using arcgis software in order to merge the data with mirca2000 in each 5 arc minute grid 10 km this confirmed that the calculated total consumption of each nutrient was within the range of the previous data bouwman et al 2009 therefore for the nice bgc simulation the authors used the spatially distributed data for fertilizer and manure application for each crop thereafter although data for plastics are scarce the authors used some data to simulate the plastic debris for japan as a whole population data at 250 m resolution was obtained from the japanese census in 2015 japanese government statistics 2021 wastewater treatment plants wwtp at 2185 locations ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit 2013 as point sources and mpw at 1 km resolution lebreton and andrady 2019 as a diffuse source table 1 2 4 plastic generation at point and non point sources and removal at wwtp some previous studies of plastic dynamics on a global scale lebreton and andrady 2019 strokal et al 2021 lebreton and andrady 2019 have predicted future plastic waste generation by considering population and gdp growth rates per country these proposed three scenarios a business as usual b improvement of waste management and c reduction of plastic use and improvement of waste management this approach is effective for evaluation of future mpw production on a regional scale strokal et al 2021 developed five scenarios with different levels of urbanization and wastewater treatment rates by considering different levels of socio economic challenge for mitigation and adaptation as five shared socio economic pathways ssps this approach is also useful for assessing the impact of urbanization on future river pollution by adopting a multi pollutant approach in the uk whitehead et al 2021 also considered three scenarios for wastewater effluent sewage sludge application and mitigation in the basin of the thames river table 2 summarizes the per capita emission of macro plastics and micro plastics into rivers determined in previous studies siegfried et al 2017 van wijnen et al 2019 boucher et al 2020 strokal et al 2021 generally micro plastics at point sources are considered to originate from four sources personal care products pcps laundry fibres car tyre wear and fragmentation of macro plastics we estimated the fluxes of micro plastics by multiplying these per capita emissions and their population distribution for each catchment flow into wwtp in the nice bgc simulation table 1 for estimating the variations of total flux in japan as a whole we used the removal efficiency of micro plastic in wwtp 99 97 and 95 higher removal efficiency for almost all secondary and tertiary treatments in japan and the density of the plastic 1010 0 1001 0 and 1000 5 kg m3 the lower density plastics pe pp and ps are overwhelmingly present in japanese rivers in the model based on previous studies for japan kataoka et al 2019 nihei et al 2020 and other developed countries siegfried et al 2017 van wijnen et al 2019 strokal et al 2021 2 5 running the simulation and verification the simulation area in all of the 109 first class river basins throughout japan was 26 0 wide by 22 0 long in longitude latitude coordinates fig 1 the nice simulation of eco hydrological processes was performed at 0 1 x 0 1 resolution in the horizontal direction and in 20 layers in the vertical direction supporting information b simulations were performed with a time step of δt 1 h for 2 years during 2014 2015 after a 6 month warm up period until a time varying equilibrium the periods of some input data such as vegetation type and land cover do not cover the simulation period table 1 subsequently nice bgc simulation for terrestrial ecosystems was conducted at the same spatial resolution with a time step of δt 1 day for the same period by inputting some of the results simulated by nice iteratively after calculating the daily averaged data from 1 hourly data supporting information b the authors used previous data ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit 2013 for per capita emission of micro plastics into rivers pcps dusts laundries and tyres and removal efficiency in wwtp siegfried et al 2017 as a point source fig 2 and table 2 the model also simulated outflow of macro plastics originated from mpw lebreton and andrady 2019 as a diffuse source fig 1f then nice bgc simulation for aquatic ecosystems was conducted by inputting the simulated results for land to a stream network model with a time step of δt 0 70 min to ensure the stability of the model the simulation was conducted for the whole of japan in the same way as the author s previous study in the global scale nakayama 2017a where the hydrologic and nutrient cycles in the world s major rivers were simulated and verified within the range of previous datasets and materials as far as possible fig s2 in supporting information the results yielded quantitative measures of model performance in terms of reproducing the seasonality and inter annual variability in nutrient and carbon fluxes as described previously by nakayama 2020 2022 these mean the extension of nice bgc coupled with plastic debris model in the present study would to be a better choice for simulating the fate and transport of plastic waste in a basin scale as described below in detailed 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the hydrologic cycle in first class class a river basins in the whole of japan the authors evaluated the hydrologic cycle in first class river basins in the whole of japan fig 3 shows the simulated results for surface runoff in major rivers with large basin area and long river channel amongst the first class rivers no 28 tone river no 36 shinano river no 54 kisoriver and no 62 yodo river in fig 1a during 2014 2015 the results show that the intermediate flow was almost constant fig 3c in comparison to the surface runoff fig 3b which implies that surface runoff is intensive during rainfall events and greatly contributes to the outflow of plastic it is also apparent that surface runoff is limited in small river basins but cannot be ignored because it is difficult to validate the hillslope runoff with almost no observation data the authors compared the simulated annual averaged values for discharge nitrogen and phosphorus transport with the previous observation data kataoka et al 2019 ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2021a for first class river basins fig 4 although the simulated discharges are slightly underestimated relative to the observed values particularly in rivers with snow areas no 3 ishikari river and no 17 kitakami river no 35 agano river no 36 shinano river in fig 1a the simulated results are generally in good agreement with observed ones fig 4a transports of nutrients simulated by the time series for the entire calculation period during 2014 2015 red circle in the figures are overestimated in comparison with the observed values fig 4b c because observation of concentrations was conducted only in the non flood periods kataoka et al 2019 the simulated values averaged only for the base flow of rivers are within the range of those in the observed values blue triangle in the figures the hydrologic regimes of both baseflow and stormflow events are important for remobilization of plastic particles in inland waters drummond et al 2020 3 2 analysis of the sensitivity of micro plastic transport to various factors the authors analysed the sensitivity of micro plastic concentration to various factors in the downstream stretch of the tone river in summer june 1 to july 20 2014 fig 5 it was found that the concentration of micro plastics was greatly affected by their particle size and density which determine the settling velocity nizzetto et al 2016 in particular almost all plastic particles with a density lower than water polypropylene pp are more buoyant than those with a higher density polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet fig 5b the simulated value was generally within the range of previous observations for limited non flood periods in the same river micro plastic concentration between 0 03 and 2 36 μg l kataoka et al 2019 nihei et al 2020 the simulated result also agreed with previous work showing that micro plastics smaller than 0 2 mm would be poorly retained in the thames river uk and would eventually be conveyed to the marine environment nizzetto et al 2016 whitehead et al 2021 the simulation also showed that the effects of degradation i e a decrease in concentration resulting from both water temperature and uv irradiation in fig 5c would not be negligible because there is a great variation with these two values this effect is particularly predominant under some conditions for example in hot and cold water and with stronger uv irradiation in summer 3 3 impact of plastic density and wwtp on riverine export of plastics into the ocean the model simulated the total plastic flux to the ocean for japan as a whole fig 6 generally large amounts of plastic flow out of some limited rivers such as the tone no 28 kiso no 54 yodo no 62 and ara rivers no 29 where there is a large proportion of macro plastic flux in comparison with micro plastic flux fig 6b although the modelled results for micro plastic flux are a little overestimated in comparison with previous observations kataoka et al 2019 in some rivers fig 6a the analysis of this scenario also shows that the total flux for japan as a whole varies according to the removal efficiency of micro plastics in wwtp 99 97 and 95 and the density of the plastic 1010 0 1001 0 and 1000 5 kg m3 fig 6c the simulated flux is within the range 1100 3500 ton yr with 1395 ton yr in case ab removal efficiency 99 and density of plastic 1001 0 kg m3 this result is relatively within the range of previously determined values i e 1835 ton yr meijer et al 2021 and 210 4976 ton yr nihei et al 2020 this shows that only limited plastics are discharged intensively to land flows out into the ocean during rainfall seasons in agreement with a previous study indicating that nearly 99 of micro plastics are deposited during their transport to coastal regions koutnik et al 2021 it will be further necessary to improve the accuracy of the modelled results by validation of observations 4 discussion 4 1 limitations of the present analysis and assessment nice bgc simulates the retention and degradation of plastics in inland water by including advection dispersion diffusion settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature figs 5 and 6 this is a great improvement from previous studies that did not account for remobilisation or burial of micro plastic particles siegfried et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 and assumed a constant retention factor and transport of a constant fraction of mpw to rivers van wijnen et al 2019 however instead of assuming plastics to be spherical particles with a constant size and density as described in equation a9 in supporting information a there is a need to simplify micro plastics by fully defining them in terms of a three dimensional probability distribution taking into account size shape and density kooi and koelmans 2019 in addition larger plastics have a greater surface area causing them to float more easily in the surface layer liu et al 2021 while the higher specific surface area of smaller plastics would cause their rapid sinking because of biofouling kooi et al 2017 furthermore large sized plastics have higher stability and show less aggregation in aquatic environments than small sized particles future advances in the uncertainty model would greatly contribute to the elucidation of the transport and the retention of macro and micro plastics in rivers together with further field surveys and laboratory experiments about plastic degradation through photodegradation temperature physical abrasion biodegradation and weathering fig 5 the detailed evaluation of the fate and transport of plastics originating from a diffuse source mpw and point sources tyres pcps dust and laundry in this study fig 2 and table 2 may also be of relevance in terms of the size and spatial distribution of plastics in inland water in particular the percentage of the sewage treatment population in japan was 92 1 in 2021 and that in tokyo was the highest at 99 8 ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2021b it will be essential to quantify in more detail the removal of micro plastics in wwtp entering from surrounding sewage systems the outflow of plastics such as microcapsules from farmland and the amount of micro plastics in rivers originating from macro plastics that have degraded on land van wijnen et al 2019 development of optimal systems for management of emissions on land and practices such as stormwater wastewater treatments could also minimize dissemination of plastics into the environment nizzetto et al 2016 koutnik et al 2021 fig 6 it will be necessary to quantify the sources sinks fluxes and fates of plastics on a basin scale and to improve environmentally relevant dose response relationships for different organisms and effective pathways windsor et al 2019 4 2 towards understanding of plastic dynamics in regulated rivers under climate change the simulated result also demonstrated the need to understand the fluxes and the hysteresis of pollutants in rivers under flood conditions by making observations that include flood periods kataoka et al 2019 as the annual flux observed only in normal water is underestimated by about one fifth fig 4 this will be further requested in the future because extreme events such as floods and droughts might increase further with climate change the assumption that artificial barriers such as dams reservoirs and gates act as sinks for all plastic particles is also conservative fig 1 because the sediment trap efficiency of these hydraulic structures may depend upon several factors lebreton et al 2017 drummond et al 2020 have also evaluated the influence of hyporheic exchange on micro plastic transport and fate in aquatic environments thus helping to overcome underestimation of the deposition retention and long term accumulation of micro plastics in streambed sediments they pointed out that micro plastic retention may be overestimated and that its fate will be inaccurately represented in rivers without considering baseflow remobilisation figs 3 and 4 recent study shows that previous studies about riverine plastic outflows based on the concept of mpw were substantially greater than reported field data and advocates the need for robust model using the human development index hdi as the main predictor mai et al 2020 from another point of view mpw lebreton and andrady 2019 used in the present study fig 1f did not include the effect of waste plastic trade flow between japan and abroad japan was some of top exporting countries of waste plastic around 2015 and some countries such as china imported this waste plastic this situation changed greatly afterwards with the establishment of basel convention united nations 2019 because some importing countries introduced import regulations mainly for the purpose of environmental protection so it is powerful to combine nice with social system method such as material flow analysis for assessing emissions into the environment for future studies under climate change fig 2 anyway the present study is an important step not only for qualification of processes but identification of hierarchy of drivers in various river catchments development of framework for reversing degradation of global water resources and especially their pollution with plastic might be powerful for achieving sustainable development goals sdg unesco 2022 5 conclusions process based nice bgc was extended to couple with plastic debris engineered materials model for freshwater systems and applied it to all the first class class a river basins in entire japan 109 river basins the new model was constructed to include as many processes related to plastic dynamics in biosphere as possible applicable to regional and basin scales advection dispersion diffusion settling dissolution and deterioration due to light and temperature nice bgc simulated how mismanaged plastic waste mpw and point sources such as tyres personal care products pcps dust and laundry in the entire country are transported from land to river and finally to the ocean the simulated result quantified large amounts of plastic flowed out of some limited rivers intensively during rainfall seasons and that macro plastic flux accounts for a larger proportion than micro plastic flux there although scenario analysis quantified the total flux varied according to some factors and was estimated as within the range of existing studies it is further necessary to minimize errors and uncertainties by using more accurate more long term and more observations these results help to quantify the impacts of plastic waste on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and find solutions and measures to reduce plastic input to the ocean credit authorship contribution statement tadanobu nakayama conceptualization methodology software validation

24287,the significant role that forests play in regulating the carbon and water exchange is critical to mitigate climate change the remote sensing data and models provide good means for estimating gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et although they seldom face issues when implemented without proper calibration the study compares the performance of empirical tg model and semi empirical preles model in estimation of gpp and et of indian moist sal forest preles predict light use efficiency evapotranspiration and soil water predicted the gpp and et adequately gpp ranged from 1 09 to 19 73 gc m 2 day 1 with rmse of 1 64 gc m 2 day 1 and et from 0 25 to 5 31 mm day 1 with rmse of 0 65 mm day 1 it was found that preles estimated gpp with higher accuracy compared to tg model a reduced rmse of 0 68 gc m 2 day 1 the study reveals with site specific parametrization semi empirical model can better predict gpp and et than empirical model keywords carbon water cycle light use efficiency eddy covariance flux data temperature greenness remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forests play a significant role in the carbon and water cycles by supporting the geosphere biosphere atmosphere interactions through the flux of carbon water energy and matter across ecosystems adams 2012 they are the major carbon pools in the terrestrial ecosystems gross primary production gpp and evapotranspiration et are the major defining fluxes of the carbon and water cycles respectively quantifying carbon and water exchange in the form of terrestrial gpp and et respectively holds immense significance in mitigating climate change liu et al 2014 nightingale et al 2007 gpp is the amount of co2 fixed during the photosynthetic reduction of the absorbed atmospheric co2 into organic compounds evapotranspiration et is the transfer of large amounts of water from vegetative tissue transpiration and soil and vegetation surface evaporation to the atmosphere it is a crucial component of the water cycle it maintains the soil water vegetation atmosphere continuum and it accounts for approximately half of the whole water contribution from the terrestrial ecosystem purohit et al 2021 the estimation of gpp and et across the spatio temporal domain has often been difficult owing to the horde of environmental factors playing an influential role in the past few decades a large number of methods have come into the limelight and have been more than often employed to understand and quantify the ecosystem fluxes running et al 2000 field et al 1995 wu et al 2010 watham et al 2017a these include field based studies along with eddy covariance remote sensing techniques and various modeling approaches grace et al 1996 jung et al 2011 gilabert et al 2015 liu et al 2015 peng et al 2019 of the various methods developed to assess the ecological dynamics of gpp and et biogeochemical models are the most advanced and effective minunno et al 2016 the models take into account the physiology related processes species and site related parameters the rapid development of eddy covariance network sufficiently aids in the calibration and validation of the empirical and semi empirical models kalfas et al 2011 jha et al 2013 yuan et al 2007 in the recent past the most commonly used approaches were the empirical ahongshangbam et al 2016 wu et al 2014 and process based models trendy project sitch et al 2015 orchidee krinner et al 2005 orchidee mict guimberteau et al 2018 cable wang et al 2010 dlem tian et al 2015 isam jain et al 2013 vegas zeng et al 2005 visit kato et al 2013 jules clark et al 2011 landclim schweizer et al 2022 beps wang et al 2014 kang et al 2022 empirical models are simple ecosystem models based absolutely on observation data and correlative relationships where the mechanism is implicit rather than the system processes korzukhin et al 1996 adams et al 2013 though they are less data demanding with fewer parameters empirical models extrapolate poorly to larger regions and overlook essential ecosystem interactions monserud 2003 they have been applied to explain the variability in productivity across vegetation types sims et al 2008 liu et al 2014 the process based models on the other hand focus on detailed biological processes of a system and are explicitly mechanistic makela et al 2000 adams et al 2013 though there is an underlying theoretical notion that they extrapolate well to larger geographical scales it is often difficult to obtain appropriate input data for newer species and sites wu et al 2011 landsberg 2003 process based models suffer from various uncertainties friedlingstein et al 2019 huntzinger et al 2012 including model structure parameterization and inaccuracies in meteorological drivers and other input data huntzinger et al 2017 li et al 2017 rogers et al 2017 wu et al 2017 which would bias flux estimates and hamper our understanding on the terrestrial carbon cycle therefore a recalibration process is always necessary to test the applicability of any model gpp and et are natural phenomenon that are governed and influenced by a number of environmental factors at any given point in time this basic knowledge of the system process is essential to accurately quantify their respective fluxes in nature baldocchi et al 1988 climatic variables act as one of the important stressors and have great influence on the productivity and vulnerability of a forest ecosystem kumar et al 2019 atmospheric temperature solar radiation precipitation soil moisture sm light vapor pressure deficit vpd vegetation type and its canopy characteristics are a few crucial environmental and biophysical parameters that have a striking influence over the diurnal and seasonal gpp and et watham et al 2017b del grosso et al 2018 sun et al 2020 srinet et al 2022 the productivity trend over a canopy is defined by the phenological process of the vegetation type zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the phenology of plants is governed by temperature light and precipitation menzel 2002 the temperature acclimation in plants to the daily and seasonal changes in temperature the light saturation of photosynthetic process with seasonal change in incoming solar radiation and the cloudy days and optimum growth conditions during the rainfall season influence the pattern of gpp and the corresponding et vpd is a driving force for et specially when coupled with sm nie et al 2021 it has a negative effect on gpp as it reduces productivity through an exponential relationship during stomatal opening liu et al 2020a studies have showed that reducing vpd significantly increases stomatal conductance when there is a stomatal limitation for co2 diffusion from the atmosphere to the sub stomatal region the rate of leaf photosynthesis increased significantly in low vpd grown plants zhang et al 2017 high vpd induces plants to close stomata in order to lessen the loss of water which in turn would constrain plant photosynthesis and thus constrain productivity liu et al 2020a a combined effect of these determines the seasonality of vegetation which varies between different vegetation compositions a thorough understanding of all these scalars and their parameters is important quite a few numbers of biogeochemical models are available which take into account a spectrum of these parameters while simulating gpp and et models with intermediary complexity overcome the gap between the empirical and process based models tian et al 2020 semi empirical models are ecosystem models which take into consideration crucial ecosystem processes environmental species or site related parameters that are not difficult to obtain and at the same time are more suitable for regional and global studies shvidenko et al 2007 minunno et al 2016 the process based models of photosynthesis such as biome bgc forest bgc and 3 pg models also commonly use semi empirical gpp models as sub modules potithep and yasuoka 2011 turner et al 2003 white et al 2000 predict light use efficiency evapotranspiration and soil water preles is a semi empirical ecosystem flux model that predicts gpp et and soil water the model uses daily averages of environmental and soil variables to estimate daily gpp et and soil water it requires daily fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation daily meteorological input and soil characteristics preles focuses on the underlying soil mechanism and the coupling of vpd and sm while predicting the daily evapotranspiration and it estimates both gpp and et simultaneously hand in hand with the same set of input and parameter data the model was originally developed for boreal forests and it was calibrated and validated for the coniferous forests in the boreal region minunno et al 2016 tian et al 2020 preles predicted boreal forest productivity in finland and the resultant estimates were consistent with the ones obtained previously using the jsbach model and modis gpp product mod17 peltoniemi et al 2015 applicability of preles to estimate the carbon and water fluxes of boreal forest was tested at a regional scale and a good performance was noted under varying climatic conditions concluding that carefully collected flux datasets used for calibration from sites that cover wide climatic variability can be used in other sites as well for improved performance of the model minunno et al 2016 a process based carbon allocating model crobas was linked with preles to assess forest growth minunno et al 2019 furthermore its applicability range was extended to a large geographic scale and site specific and multisite calibrations were applied to different vegetation types tian et al 2020 the study concluded that preles could reliably capture daily and seasonal variability of gpp and et for contrasting forest types provided plant functional type pft specific parameterizations were applied although a focus has been made on global extrapolation of preles tropical moist deciduous forests representing the meteorological and soil conditions of indian sub continent have not been included as a pft for validating the model performance thus the present study focuses on calibrating the model for subtropical climatic conditions in india and assessing the validity of the estimated results with empirical modeling approach which have been employed previously srinet et al 2020 watham et al 2017a in light of this the study objectives are to estimate the spatio temporal variability of the ecosystem fluxes gpp and et using the preles and temperature greenness tg model in the moist deciduous sal forest of barkot and to compare the performance of preles with the tg model and the modis gpp and et products 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the barkot reserve forest 30 03ʹ52ʹʹ 30 10ʹ43ʹʹn 78 09ʹ 49ʹ 78 17ʹ 09ʹʹe uttarakhand india located in the doon valley the study area is classified as tropical moist deciduous forest sub group 3c champion and seth 1968 it is a sal shorea robusta dominated forest with an understorey of various co dominant species including rohini mallotus philippensis sain terminalia tomentosa chamror ehretia laevis and dhauri lagerstroemia parviflora the other associates of sal are amaltas cassia fistula bahera terminalia bellirica haldu haldina cordifolia jamun syzigium cumini sandan ougeinia oojeinensis and karaunda carissa opaca the area is characterized by sub tropical humid climate with temperature ranging from 2 to 42 c an average annual rainfall of 1115 40 mm the area is characterized by sandy loam soil type and the soil has high moisture holding capacity an eddy co variance ec flux tower barkot flux site bfs fig 1 is functioning at barkot since 2011 under isro geosphere biosphere programme isro gbp to measure the continuous exchange of carbon and water between the forest and the atmosphere 2 2 model framework predict light use efficiency evapotranspiration and soil water is an ecosystem flux model which is semi empirical in nature it predicts daily gpp p k gc m 2 day 1 et e k mm day 1 and soil water mm using minimum site specific standard weather and soil data the site specific input data includes soil depth mm field capacity mm and wilting point mm of the soil f apar and mean daily meteorological observations that include air temperature precipitation vapor pressure deficit vpd and photosynthetically active radiation par the daily gpp during a given day k p k is predicted as p k β ϕ k f a p a r k f l k f s k min f d k f w p k f c o 2 p k where β is the potential light use efficiency maximum lue attained at low light in optimal conditions ϕ is the incident photosynthetically active radiation f apar is the fraction of ϕ that is absorbed by the canopy and f l f s f d and f w are the model constraining modifiers that account for the suboptimal environmental conditions in light temperature vpd and soil water stress respectively at day k the entire absorbed par is not used in photosynthesis the light modifier f l describes the saturation of photosynthetic production with high par with the function f l 1 γ ϕ 1 where γ is the parameter for saturation with irradiance the model uses three storage components to track the daily soil water balance surfacial water due to interception on the canopy surface θsurf snow water θsnow and soil water storages θ all storage components are bucket models with the following equations θ s u r f k 1 θ s u r f k r k 1 e k s u r f f s u r f k θ s n o w k 1 θ s n o w k r k 0 e k s n o w m k θ k 1 θ k f s u r f k m k f k e k s o i l where the subscript k denotes day r 1 and r 0 are the rainfall and snowfall respectively in the present study precipitation as snow is taken to be zero f is the drainage m is the snowmelt f s u r f is the drainage from canopy surface to soil and e consists of components from each of the water storages interception of precipitation on the canopy surface occurs only upto the maximum surfacial storage capacity θsurf max beyond which the additional precipitation drains off to soil water storage θ when the effective field capacity of soil θfc is reached the additional water drains off as run off at a rate proportional to current daily soil water content above θfc f k θ k θ f c τ f in this equation τ is the delay parameter of drainage determines the proportional decrease of θ relative to θfc until it is reached the temperature acclimation modifier is used for modeling temperature effects using the following equations f s k min s k s m a x 1 w h e r e s k max x k x 0 0 w h e r e x k x k 1 1 τ t k x k 1 w i t h x 1 t 1 s k c is the state

of temperature acclimation state to the changes in ambient temperature s k starts increasing f s after the threshold x 0 c for x k is reached the acclimation modifier reaches its maximum at the threshold s m a x c when the steady temperature level s m a x x 0 is reached canopy photosynthesis is no further constrained by temperature following the principle of one constraint on stomatal conductance the d and w modifiers are merged in this model selecting the minimum of the two functions assuming either vpd or soil water effect constraints canopy photosynthesis on any given day the model uses previous day s estimates for soil water and the present day s d to calculate the f modifier for the present day f d w p min f d f w p where f w p is derived from relative extractable water rew denoted here as w w θ θ w p θ f c θ w p where θ is soil water content θ w p is soil water content at wilting point θ f c is the soil water content at field capacity f w increases with increasing w between 0 and soil water stress threshold for photosynthesis ρp f w p m i n 1 w ρ p the co2 modifier accounts for the effect of ambient co2 concentration on photosynthesis this effect is accounted for in two ways a the co2 modifier represents the mean increase of gpp with increasing co2 c a f c o 2 1 c a c a 0 c a c a 0 c m b increasing co2 also influences stomatal conductance and it becomes less reactive to vpd and hence the model introduces a multiplier for κ sensitivity parameter of fd for gpp response to vpd in the f d modifier in the form of c a 0 c a c κ the daily et during a given day k e k is predicted as e k α p k f w p k ν d k 1 λ χ 1 f a p a r k ϕ k f w e k where α and χ are the linear parameters for transpiration and evaporation respectively the soil water modifier has a different effect on gpp and et and this difference in the et model is accounted for by ν the adjustment parameter λ was introduced to linearize the response of e on p under the effect of d the soil water modifier for et is slightly different in that it accounts for evaporation under dry soil and has its own soil stress threshold ρe f w e min 1 w ρ e the detailed description of the model can be found in peltoniemi et al 2015 2 3 datasets for the purpose of this study the model was calibrated using ec flux data from the bfs and modis satellite data from 2016 to 2018 and validation of the gpp and et estimates was carried out using independent available ec flux dataset of 2019 2020 2 3 1 eddy covariance data the eddy flux measurements of co2 and h2o have been collected since 2014 at the bfs pillai et al 2019 the daily meteorological data of air temperature c precipitation mm par vpd and carbon di oxide ppm used as input were obtained from the various instruments installed on the flux tower at bfs the ground observed gpp and et for the validation purpose were also obtained from bfs using ec technique watham et al 2020 gpp was inferred from net ecosystem exchange nee and et from latent heat le the daily measurements were calculated from the half hourly observations of covariance of fluctuations in the vertical wind velocity and the co2 and h2o concentrations measured at 10 hz after appropriate gap filling has been done watham et al 2014 2 3 2 modis satellite data the satellite data used in this study was acquired from the moderate imaging spectroradiometer modis terra satellite modis acquires data in 36 spectral bands from 450 nm to 2100 nm this data is of useful insight for global dynamics on the land and in the oceans it provides various products of forests and forest related parameters such as f apar vegetation indices gpp and et on a global scale 2 3 3 modis 8 day surface reflectance product the time series of f apar and enhanced vegetation index evi were derived from the surface reflectance datasets mod09a1 the surface reflectance product is an 8 day 500 m resolution product on a sinusoidal grid it is computed from the modis bands 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 with the bandwidths 648 nm 858 nm 470 nm 555 nm 1240 nm 1640 nm and 2130 nm respectively the f apar describes the stand information and the canopy structural component in the preles model it was derived as a function of leaf area index lai and variable atmospheric resistance index vari watham et al 2017b to counter the atmospheric cloud effects using the spectral bands as follows v a r i g r

along with land surface temperature lst data it normalizes the red band s reflectance as a function of the blue band s reflectance evi is used to assess the productivity as it includes the blue band also which accounts for variability in soil and vegetation background reflectance it was derived as follows e v i 2 5 n i r r e d n i r 6 r e d 7 5 b l u e 1 2 3 4 modis 8 day lst product the mod11a1 product provides lst and emissivity bands the daily time series of lst was obtained at 8 day 1 km resolution incorporation of lst aids during the photosynthetically inactive periods as temperature enables the model to capture the environmental stress on vegetation productivity and hence the model will closely follow the physiological aspects 2 3 5 modis 8 day gpp product the modis gpp product mod17a2h is a global productivity dataset at 8 days at 500 m pixel resolution it is designed to provide regular measure of terrestrial vegetation growth and productivity the product employs an lue type model to calculate gpp using the surface meteorological modis land cover and f apar lai modis provides a composite gpp data for every 8 days gc m 2 8d 1 this data was downloaded for the entire study period and later converted to 8 days average to correspond with the flux tower observation for comparison with preles and tg estimated gpp by dividing the values by 8 gc m 2 day 1 2 3 6 modis 8 day et product the modis et product mod16a2 500 m provides global terra net evapotranspiration and latent heat datasets at 500 m pixel resolution the et bands are a result of the sum of all 8 days within the composite period and the le bands are an average of all the 8 days in that composite period it uses the penman monteith equation to calculate the net et using daily meteorological reanalysis data and modis land cover and albedo modis provides a composite et data for every 8 days mm 8d 1 similar to gpp the modis et values were also converted to 8 days average to correspond with the flux tower observation for comparison with preles et by dividing the values by 8 mm day 1 2 4 methodology 2 4 1 site specific calibration of preles the preles model was calibrated for 21 site specific parameters the model was originally developed for the boreal forest and accordingly included snow parameters barkot reserve forest is completely devoid of snow and hence the snow related parameters were set to zero the environmental stress parameters concerning the local soil and species physiology were calibrated using field flux tower observed data the study area is dominated by moist sal forest and has a sandy loam soil texture the measures for soil depth effective field capacity permanent wilting point and drainage delay parameters of the soil modifier were obtained from the field measurements collected by the uttarakhand forest department in 2021 the potential light use efficiency transpiration efficiency evaporation parameter threshold for state of acclimation and threshold for maximum temperature the acclimation modifier reaches were obtained from the flux tower observations the remaining parameters were calibrated in accordance with these 2 4 2 estimation of gpp and et using preles the structural and meteorological data were used to simulate gpp and et for a single pixel where the barkot flux tower is located the predicted daily mean fluxes were validated against the flux tower observed gpp and et preles is a point model with the calibrated parameters the model was implemented for the entire study area as a loop function and the fluxes were estimated at the ecosystem scale the time series of the estimated values were rasterized and analysed for daily changes seasonal variability and annual patterns of the fluxes 2 4 3 temperature greenness model the temperature greenness tg model was implemented at barkot to estimate gpp and compare the model s performance with that of preles the tg model was developed by sims et al 2008 the gpp was defined as g p p s c a l e d l s t s c a l e d e v i m where m is the conversion coefficient with the unit gc m 2 day 1 lst and evi were scaled using the following equations 4 5 s c a l e d l s t min l s t t m i n t o p t t m i n t m a x l s t t m a x t o p t where min represents the minimum of the two linear functions in parenthesis tmin topt and tmax are minimum optimum and maximum temperature for photosynthesis respectively the optimum temperature was calculated using tower obtained gpp and temperature sims et al 2008 reported that around an evi of 0 1 gpp drops to zero this is accounted for by scaling the evi as 4 6 s c a l e d e v i e v i 0 1 a similar response of gpp to evi was observed in the study area the model is parameterized by estimating the conversion coefficient m for this purpose the flux tower observed gpp is plotted against the product of scaled lst and scaled evi and slope m is calculated srinet et al 2020 performed a similar study in the same study area and for the same study period the m scalar obtained in their study 38 97 gc m 2 day 1 was used in the tg algorithm to estimate gpp in the present study the tg model predicted gpp preles model predicted gpp and the modis obtained gpp were plotted against flux tower observed gpp and compared similarly preles predicted et and modis obtained et were plotted against flux tower observed et and compared 3 results 3 1 calibration of preles the model was parameterized using the flux tower measurements and the field observations we calibrated the model with three years data on meteorological variables from 2016 to 2018 a plausible range of variability of the parameters was taken as prior distributions and a series of combinations of these parameter values was used simultaneously in model calibration and the outputs were validated against the available data finally arriving at the set of values that is the best fit for the study area site and pft specific values were calculated from the field flux tower observations made at bfs these include soil depth effective field capacity permanent wilting point soil drainage light use efficiency transpiration efficiency evaporation parameter and the minimum and maximum temperatures for photosynthetic acclimations table 1 lists the parameters used in the study during calibration interaction between the parameters with each other was observed correlation between parameters indicates their combined effect and that they partially compensated each other s effect the highest parameter correlations were observed between potential light use efficiency β and irradiance saturation parameter γ followed by start of temperature acclimation xₒ and maximum temperature for acclimation smax and γ and the sensitivity parameter of f d for gpp response to vpd κ also in et model parameters between transpiration parameter α and evaporation parameter χ these parameter pairs complement each other s function and jointly control the ecosystem fluxes the light temperature and vpd modifiers had highest influence in defining the gpp and et fluxes the light use efficiency and the irradiance saturation parameter γ for gpp contributed the maximum to photosynthetic prediction and γ also had a pronounced effect on all the predictions especially on gpp the soil water parameters were also among the most sensitive parameters although their effect was less in the wet season jun oct all the parameters captured the seasonal variability of the fluxes correctly with an increased sensitivity during the dry seasons nov feb there was a general tendency of gpp to decrease with increasing γ and also increasing κ but the soil water stress threshold parameters ρp ρe highly defined the dry season this site specific calibration showed robust performance in predicting the photosynthetic activity and the water exchange of moist deciduous forest 3 2 estimation of the ecosystem fluxes using preles preles yielded mean daily measures of gpp and et from 2016 to 2020 fig 2 and the estimated fluxes agreed well with the observed fluxes 3 2 1 estimation of gross primary productivity the preles estimated gpp ranged from 1 09 to 19 73 gc m 2 day 1 it agreed well with the observed gpp r2 0 74 n 636 also evident from the low root mean square error rmse value of 1 87 gc m 2 day 1 and mean absolute percent error mape value of 24 51 fig 3 a the lowest gpp was recorded in january and february and it gradually started to increase from the end of march peaked during august and september and then gradually decreased from october precisely following the phenological pattern of the moist deciduous sal forest at barkot the mean daily estimated gpp was summed as a composite and compared with observed gpp table 2 the mean annual gpp computed using only complete year data for the study period was found to be mean std error 3118 66 201 22 gc m 2 year 1 the annual estimates of 2016 and 2017 did not show great variations but gpp in 2018 drastically dropped by approximately 600 gc m 2 year 1 3 2 2 estimation of evapotranspiration the estimated et ranged from 0 25 to 5 31 mm day 1 the goodness of fit of et predictions was weaker compared to gpp predictions on validation the model estimated et with an rmse of 0 78 mm day 1 and a mape of 27 51 and gave an r2 0 44 n 555 fig 3b et followed the trend corresponding to gpp the lowest et was recorded in january and february and it gradually started to increase from the end of march and peaked during august and september and then decreased from october the trend corresponded well with the observed et srinet et al 2022 the mean daily estimated et was summed as a composite and compared with observed et table 2 the mean annual et computed using only complete year data for the study period was found to be mean std error 674 84 38 15 mm year 1 3 3 estimation of gpp with tg model the 8 day average gpp was calculated from 2016 2020 using the tg model the m scalar value used in this study was 38 97 gc m 2 day 1 3 25 molc m 2 day 1 which is comparatively higher than the m values obtained at other deciduous forests srinet et al 2020 the high m value indicates the high productivity of the moist deciduous forests the estimated gpp ranged between 1 78 to 19 73 gc m 2 day 1 the mean monthly intra annual gpp for 2016 was mapped fig 4 the productivity was low during the dry season and started increasing from the end of may peaked during the growing season in august and september and then decreased from october slightly higher values were noted in february and november compared to the observed values further the preles and tg estimated gpp were compared with the modis gpp product and the preles estimated et was compared with the modis et product against the flux tower observed gpp and et respectively 3 3 1 comparison of gpp using different models the performance of estimated gpps and mod17 gpp were compared against ec flux tower observed gpp of 2019 2020 figs 5 6 on comparison between similar data points n 138 it was found that both preles and tg the models provided better results than the mod17 gpp product preles performed the best rmse 1 64 gc m 2 day 1 mape 18

rmse 2 32 gc m 2 day 1 mape 22 57 it made overestimations in the growing season especially during the start of the growing season and underestimations in the dry seasons mod17 gpp product on the other

all the gpps at 8 days averaged values with observed gpp of 2019 2020 3 3 2 comparison of et using different models the performance of preles estimated et and mod16 et were compared against the flux

deciduous sal forest mod16 et on the other hand highly underperformed at the study site rmse 2 29 mm day 1 mape 71 23 and the values ranged between 0 and 4 37 mm day 1 it showed remarkably underestimated values during the dry season and overestimated values during the growing season with many notable dips in the monsoons fig 8 a b shows the validation graphs for all the ets at 8 days averaged data with observed et of 2019 2020 4 discussion 4 1 calibration of the model preles the simplified ecosystem model is an ecologically based model with a wide applicability due to the feasibility of model inputs we tested the model s applicability to moist deciduous forest in india and calibrated it for the moist sal vegetation at barkot reserve forest model calibrations provided good fits for the study area especially for gpp while et showed slight overestimations at the start of the growing season the parameters of f w play an important role in the model by defining the soil type which is characteristic of vegetation and climate type soil moisture is a driver of evapotranspiration and the soil water content is determined by the soil water storage capacity soil depth θd field capacity θfc and wilting point θwp preles considers the contribution of soil moisture in predicting evapotranspiration which is seldom included in other ecosystem models peltoniemi et al 2015 the study area falls in the himalayan foothills and is characterized by moist deciduous forest type and sandy loam soil texture sandy loam soil structures have high water holding capacity and their soil depth usually varies between 1000 mm to 1700 mm effective field capacity is the amount of water that the soil retains after the excess of water from precipitation has drained off permanent wilting point is a threshold for dryness below which there is no water available for the plants soil reaches its θfc after the excess water has drained off sandy loam soils usually take only about 1 1 5 days to drain off after irrigation the model uses the feed in between θfc and θwp as relative extractible water rew and the initial level of soil water to calculate et and θ simultaneously where et has gpp as input the soil water storage parameters are very sensitive but they may play small role in the wet seasons since vpd and its parameters become controlling factors in the presence of excess moisture outside the leaf patane 2011 amitrano et al 2019 preles includes various modifiers that account for the environmental influence on all the predictions and the parameter response to seasonality the f s parameters define the acclimation of photosynthetic process to the seasonal and daily changes in the temperature deciduous forests need lower temperatures xₒ and lesser delay periods τ to start temperature acclimation unlike temperate evergreen and temperate deciduous forests tian et al 2020 the soil water stress threshold parameters ρp ρe account for drought conditions and majorly control the trend and maintain the pattern during the dry seasons the dry season fluxes are a reflection of the decreased soil moisture during the off season which limits the plant growth and productivity it also affects et when there is overall reduced available water for stomatal transpiration and soil evaporation soil water limits assimilation of co2 and transpiration affecting both gpp and et liu et al 2020b this stress becomes limiting when water affects stomatal conductance the threshold parameters account for water stress when the threshold for rew exceeds the physiological processes are affected and plants are water stressed or there is a soil water deficit which occurs when rew drops below the threshold level of 0 4 bréda et al 2006 between θwp and ρ f w has a positive linear relationship and after that the model assumes f w as 1 deciduous plants have less conservative strategy for water use choat et al 2012 and hence the sites dominated by deciduous species seem to be more vulnerable to damage from drought these threshold parameters and the temperature parameters have high site sensitivity and need to be carefully calibrated for newer sites they were set considering the impact of κ and λ which is the parameter for response of et to vpd keeping in view the coupling of vpd and soil water in nature gpp and et are highly sensitive to the light temperature and vpd scalars gilabert et al 2015 the f l plays an essential role in estimation of productivity the gpp prediction is sensitive to β and γ which were also highly correlated with each other yuan et al 2007 tian et al 2020 this is expected since γ determines the degree of non linearity of the response of photosynthesis to solar irradiance and β has a direct relationship with all variables and modifiers and the directly proportional relation between evapotranspiration and photosynthesis renders even et perceptive of the same parameters as gpp evapotranspiration showed a sensitive response to α and χ they are crucial parameters as they separate transpiration under stomatal control from evaporation from other surfaces especially when coupled with wider leaf areas or canopy densities peltoniemi et al 2015 transpiration and evaporation compensate each other and α and χ are linear multipliers of both the components respectively the high complimentary behavior of these parameters with each other makes them highly site specific higher values of these parameters markedly increase et which subsequently decreases θ larger et means less soil water content these parameters are also important for gpp while determining the dry season as they are connected to gpp and et through θ which has a positive linear effect on stomatal conductance reduced stomatal conductance reduces photosynthesis farquhar and sharkey 1982 hence reduced θ subsequently reduces gpp associated with this the dry season was also timely developed in the model since β is lower for deciduous species lu and zaung 2010 found that deciduous broad leaved forests show inverse water use efficiency the parameter α was designed with similar interpretation in the model as deciduous forests also show higher inherent water use efficiency beer et al 2009 and hence it was set at a very low level in the present study both these et parameters are also highly site sensitive and should be carefully calibrated to avoid any over and under estimations parameter for response of f d to vpd κ had some level of sensitivity on all predicted variables as it is fairly related to drought conditions due to its influence on stomatal conductance and et nie et al 2021 it also showed significant influence on gpp vpd negatively affects gpp liu et al 2020a and the sensitivity parameter κ is a negative value 4 2 estimation of gpp and et the model calibration was consistent and the validations demonstrated that preles can successfully and accurately estimate gpp and et in moist deciduous forest in india the study site represents a subtropical humid climate zone and is characterized as sal dominated moist deciduous forest the daily changes in the fluxes were well acknowledged by the model the model accurately captured the intra annual variability of gpp and et revealing the phenological pattern of moist deciduous sal forests attributed to the climatic variables the tropical deciduous forests reflect a marked influence of temperature and light on growth makela et al 2004 and the inclusion of various parameters related to temperature and light stress contribute to the spatio temporal phenological variation in estimated gpp and et of barkot forest the moist deciduous pfts experience leaf senescence in february and new leaf growth occurs during the end of march to april srinet et al 2020 the growing season in deciduous sal forests is from may to september and the dry season phenological changes occur between october and february watham et al 2017 preles simulated a similar pattern of productivity the photosynthetic production was less in january and february and started increasing from the end of march evapotranspiration corresponding with plant productivity owing to carbon uptake and release via stomata also showed a similar pattern it can be clearly seen in the plot that maximum carbon conversion and water exchange was during the peak seasons august and september the variation of gpp and et within an annual period reveals the effect of phenology and climatic factors on the fluxes this is attributed mostly to the temperature berry and bjorkman 1980 and the soil water stress threshold parameters which mark the seasonal variability and soil dryness soil moisture drives transpiration and when coupled with vpd it also influences stomatal opening buckley 2005 the soil dryness in the dry season complemented the decreasing trend of the fluxes in model prediction barkot experiences monsoon season from late june to september and this probably may be the reason for the seasonal trend of increased productivity and evapotranspiration during the months of july to september where the conditions for growth are favorable light temperature and precipitation the carbon conversion coefficient of the tg model used here was taken from a previous study srinet et al 2020 conducted at barkot for the same time period the estimated value was found to be comparatively higher than that for most deciduous forests the higher value indicates the humid condition of the study area and the high productivity associated with it this was also reflected in the simulations although a generally good performance was seen from tg model preles captured the intra annual variability more accurately this could be attributed to the various parameters included in the model tg overestimated gpp in the peak season and underestimated in the dry season many studies reported a very good performance from tg model while depicting seasonal variations dong et al 2017 watham et al 2017a srinet et al 2020 tang et al 2021 and others but similar issues in estimations were also reported in a few studies sims et al 2008 reported a high correlation coefficient between tg gpp and observed gpp for all the deciduous forests in their study but this was not seen in other study sites vegetation sites deciduous forests are noted to overestimate simulations of gpp from the tg model during the start of the growing season sims et al 2008 tang et al 2021 srinet et al 2020 a pattern also observed in the present study this may be attributed to the non linear relationship between gpp and scaledlst scaledevi another reason for underperformance of tg model could be due to lst soil surface temperature significantly affects lst sims et al 2008 during the dry season it is difficult to obtain sensible physiological activity from lst leading to underestimations of productivity errors introduced by lst may also be influenced by soil moisture soil moisture influences emissivity which has a strong impact on the magnitude of surface temperature sun and pinker 2004 most empirical models use entirely satellite data for simulation of vegetation productivity the major issue with this is the availability of spatial data in only coarse resolution these models in general average most of the topographic landscape features and neglect the effect of terrain and aspect on photosynthesis li et al 2016 xie and li 2020 these limitations render tg model capable in predicting gpp only in regions which do not have extensive in situ measurements and meteorological data generally tg model predicts seasonal variability with significant accuracy liu et al 2014 dong et al 2017 watham et al 2017a zhang et al 2019 srinet et al 2020 tang et al 2021 but only the temperature parameter and the vegetation cover do not exactly highlight the physiological processes of the vegetation this holds true for any empirical model for that matter where only observation and experience is used to establish an empirical relationship between any two or a few of the predictor variables lue models on the other hand consider various environmental stress scalars in their algorithms a universal set of parameters works well for most empirical models including satellite driven lue models even lue is an empirical relationship between gpp f apar and par but it considers the impact of a few environmental scalars which may vary between pfts and hence its performance has been noted to be better than non lue empirical models preles is also a series of empirical models but a good performance is reported from it on a regional scale as it can be optimized for different vegetation types and different climatic conditions minunno et al 2016 and tian et al 2020 it is assumed that tg showed slight underperformance owing to the input data and lack of proper understanding of the physiology and environment of the vegetation by the model when compared with preles the gpp estimated during this study as expected was higher than the npp net primary productivity reported using satellite data kumar et al 2019 reported npp of 0 1460 gc m 2 year 1 and npp of 800 gc m 2 year 1 for the indian himalayan forests bala et al 2013 the mean annual gpp of 3118 66 gc m 2 year 1 observed during this study well agrees with value reported form india similar gpp of 3358 167 gc m 2 year 1 for tropical dry deciduous forest of central india rodda et al 2021 lesser gpp of 2812 59 gc m 2 year 1 for broadleaf deciduous forest of northeast india and gpp of 1850 28 gc m 2 year 1 for coniferous evergreen forest of north india burman et al 2021 thus suggesting being a highly productive forest 4 3 comparison between models for the purpose of this study gpp was estimated using preles and tg and et was estimated using preles at barkot forest both the models provide better results over modis products preles gives the best estimation of gpp among the three models this is followed by tg model and modis gpp product highly underestimated gpp preles is a semi empirical model which uses an lue empirical algorithm to estimate gpp modis gpp product also uses an lue algorithm a typical difference between both the algorithms is the calculation of lue both the models use climatic variables to reduce maximum lue under unfavorable conditions although preles uses additional environmental scalars which monitor the inter linking effects between temperature soil water stress vapor pressure deficit and lue determination of lue across seasons and vegetation types poses a challenge on different models tg model on the other hand is an empirical model and gains merit by its reliability on entirely remote sensing data it employs a combination of evi and lst to estimate gpp tg has been considerably reported to give a good performance since evi is an indicator of greenness and stand structure and lst is a proxy of par and accounts for environmental scalars but it introduces uncertainties in modis reflectance and spatial resolution in a comparison between preles estimated et and modis et product preles yielded better results the preles estimates et using an empirical model following the gpp lue function of the model it calculates et as a function of canopy conductance and vpd of the air and considers daily gpp to be a good predictor of the daily sum of evapotranspiration acknowledging the relationship between soil water vpd and canopy conductance the model algorithm also takes account of the effect of vapor pressure and the differential effect of soil water stress on transpiration water use efficiency of vegetation and considers the effect of radiation on non stomatal surfaces modis uses the penman monteith equation to calculate et it separately incorporates functions for albedo lai f apar and land cover to account for effects of temperature canopy evaporation plant transpiration and soil evaporation overall preles was observed to estimate gpp and et with higher precision for the moist deciduous sal forest at barkot preles considers the influence of various environmental variables and scalars at the same time since gpp and et are not driven by only one parameter at a time the involvement of many physiological properties and climatic influencers at the same time brings out phenological variability more accurately 5 conclusion in this study we calibrated the preles model and estimated the gpp and et in the moist deciduous forest at barkot reserve forest uttarakhand india a combination of ec flux meteorological measurements and modis data were used to parameterize the model the model performance was good in the study site and the results were consistent with previous studies conducted here the mean annual gpp and et between 2016 and 2018 stood at 3118 66 201 22 gc m 2 year 1 and 674 84 38 15 mm year 1 mean std error respectively preles accurately captured the seasonality of the sal vegetation in terms of productivity the 8 day average gpp was estimated using tg model that reflected the highly productive nature of the study area overall the diurnal and seasonal variability of the fluxes was more accurately predicted by preles as compared with the tg model and the modis gpp and et products the results obtained in this study can be used for estimating the fluxes at other similar vegetation types and also aid in calibrating the model for newer sites and develop a deeper understanding of the indian ecosystems and their associated processes preles appears to be a better modeling approach for ecosystem fluxes as it simulates both gpp and et simultaneously and holds a potential to determine the capacity of different soil types to store and release water which remains a global problem

24287,the significant role that forests play in regulating the carbon and water exchange is critical to mitigate climate change the remote sensing data and models provide good means for estimating gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et although they seldom face issues when implemented without proper calibration the study compares the performance of empirical tg model and semi empirical preles model in estimation of gpp and et of indian moist sal forest preles predict light use efficiency evapotranspiration and soil water predicted the gpp and et adequately gpp ranged from

a reduced rmse of 0 68 gc m 2 day 1 the study reveals with site specific parametrization semi empirical model can better predict gpp and et than empirical model keywords carbon water cycle light use efficiency eddy covariance flux data temperature greenness remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forests play a significant role in the carbon and water cycles by supporting the geosphere biosphere atmosphere interactions through the flux of carbon water energy and matter across ecosystems adams 2012 they are the major carbon pools in the terrestrial ecosystems gross primary production gpp and evapotranspiration et are the major defining fluxes of the carbon and water cycles respectively quantifying carbon and water exchange in the form of terrestrial gpp and et respectively holds immense significance in mitigating climate change liu et al 2014 nightingale et al 2007 gpp is the amount of co2 fixed during the photosynthetic reduction of the absorbed atmospheric co2 into organic compounds evapotranspiration et is the transfer of large amounts of water from vegetative tissue transpiration and soil and vegetation surface evaporation to the atmosphere it is a crucial component of the water cycle it maintains the soil water vegetation atmosphere continuum and it accounts for approximately half of the whole water contribution from the terrestrial ecosystem purohit et al 2021 the estimation of gpp and et across the spatio temporal domain has often been difficult owing to the horde of environmental factors playing an influential role in the past few decades a large number of methods have come into the limelight and have been more than often employed to understand and quantify the ecosystem fluxes running et al 2000 field et al 1995 wu et al 2010 watham et al 2017a these include field based studies along with eddy covariance remote sensing techniques and various modeling approaches grace et al 1996 jung et al 2011 gilabert et al 2015 liu et al 2015 peng et al 2019 of the various methods developed to assess the ecological dynamics of gpp and et biogeochemical models are the most advanced and effective minunno et al 2016 the models take into account the physiology related processes species and site related parameters the rapid development of eddy covariance network sufficiently aids in the calibration and validation of the empirical and semi empirical models kalfas et al 2011 jha et al 2013 yuan et al 2007 in the recent past the most commonly used approaches were the empirical ahongshangbam et al 2016 wu et al 2014 and process based models trendy project sitch et al 2015 orchidee krinner et al 2005 orchidee mict guimberteau et al 2018 cable wang et al 2010 dlem tian et al 2015 isam jain et al 2013 vegas zeng et al 2005 visit kato et al 2013 jules clark et al 2011 landclim schweizer et al 2022 beps wang et al 2014 kang et al 2022 empirical models are simple ecosystem models based absolutely on observation data and correlative relationships where the mechanism is implicit rather than the system processes korzukhin et al 1996 adams et al 2013 though they are less data demanding with fewer parameters empirical models extrapolate poorly to larger regions and overlook essential ecosystem interactions monserud 2003 they have been applied to explain the variability in productivity across vegetation types sims et al 2008 liu et al 2014 the process based models on the other hand focus on detailed biological processes of a system and are explicitly mechanistic makela et al 2000 adams et al 2013 though there is an underlying theoretical notion that they extrapolate well to larger geographical scales it is often difficult to obtain appropriate input data for newer species and sites wu et al 2011 landsberg 2003 process based models suffer from various uncertainties friedlingstein et al 2019 huntzinger et al 2012 including model structure parameterization and inaccuracies in meteorological drivers and other input data huntzinger et al 2017 li et al 2017 rogers et al 2017 wu et al 2017 which would bias flux estimates and hamper our understanding on the terrestrial carbon cycle therefore a recalibration process is always necessary to test the applicability of any model gpp and et are natural phenomenon that are governed and influenced by a number of environmental factors at any given point in time this basic knowledge of the system process is essential to accurately quantify their respective fluxes in nature baldocchi et al 1988 climatic variables act as one of the important stressors and have great influence on the productivity and vulnerability of a forest ecosystem kumar et al 2019 atmospheric temperature solar radiation precipitation soil moisture sm light vapor pressure deficit vpd vegetation type and its canopy characteristics are a few crucial environmental and biophysical parameters that have a striking influence over the diurnal and seasonal gpp and et watham et al 2017b del grosso et al 2018 sun et al 2020 srinet et al 2022 the productivity trend over a canopy is defined by the phenological process of the vegetation type zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the phenology of plants is governed by temperature light and precipitation menzel 2002 the temperature acclimation in plants to the daily and seasonal changes in temperature the light saturation of photosynthetic process with seasonal change in incoming solar radiation and the cloudy days and optimum growth conditions during the rainfall season influence the pattern of gpp and the corresponding et vpd is a driving force for et specially when coupled with sm nie et al 2021 it has a negative effect on gpp as it reduces productivity through an exponential relationship during stomatal opening liu et al 2020a studies have showed that reducing vpd significantly increases stomatal conductance when there is a stomatal limitation for co2 diffusion from the atmosphere to the sub stomatal region the rate of leaf photosynthesis increased significantly in low vpd grown plants zhang et al 2017 high vpd induces plants to close stomata in order to lessen the loss of water which in turn would constrain plant photosynthesis and thus constrain productivity liu et al 2020a a combined effect of these determines the seasonality of vegetation which varies between different vegetation compositions a thorough understanding of all these scalars and their parameters is important quite a few numbers of biogeochemical models are available which take into account a spectrum of these parameters while simulating gpp and et models with intermediary complexity overcome the gap between the empirical and process based models tian et al 2020 semi empirical models are ecosystem models which take into consideration crucial ecosystem processes environmental species or site related parameters that are not difficult to obtain and at the same time are more suitable for regional and global studies shvidenko et al 2007 minunno et al 2016 the process based models of photosynthesis such as biome bgc forest bgc and 3 pg models also commonly use semi empirical gpp models as sub modules potithep and yasuoka 2011 turner et al 2003 white et al 2000 predict light use efficiency evapotranspiration and soil water preles is a semi empirical ecosystem flux model that predicts gpp et and soil water the model uses daily averages of environmental and soil variables to estimate daily gpp et and soil water it requires daily fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation daily meteorological input and soil characteristics preles focuses on the underlying soil mechanism and the coupling of vpd and sm while predicting the daily evapotranspiration and it estimates both gpp and et simultaneously hand in hand with the same set of input and parameter data the model was originally developed for boreal forests and it was calibrated and validated for the coniferous forests in the boreal region minunno et al 2016 tian et al 2020 preles predicted boreal forest productivity in finland and the resultant estimates were consistent with the ones obtained previously using the jsbach model and modis gpp product mod17 peltoniemi et al 2015 applicability of preles to estimate the carbon and water fluxes of boreal forest was tested at a regional scale and a good performance was noted under varying climatic conditions concluding that carefully collected flux datasets used for calibration from sites that cover wide climatic variability can be used in other sites as well for improved performance of the model minunno et al 2016 a process based carbon allocating model crobas was linked with preles to assess forest growth minunno et al 2019 furthermore its applicability range was extended to a large geographic scale and site specific and multisite calibrations were applied to different vegetation types tian et al 2020 the study concluded that preles could reliably capture daily and seasonal variability of gpp and et for contrasting forest types provided plant functional type pft specific parameterizations were applied although a focus has been made on global extrapolation of preles tropical moist deciduous forests representing the meteorological and soil conditions of indian sub continent have not been included as a pft for validating the model performance thus the present study focuses on calibrating the model for subtropical climatic conditions in india and assessing the validity of the estimated results with empirical modeling approach which have been employed previously srinet et al 2020 watham et al 2017a in light of this the study objectives are to estimate the spatio temporal variability of the ecosystem fluxes gpp and et using the preles and temperature greenness tg model in the moist deciduous sal forest of barkot and to compare the performance of preles with the tg model and the modis gpp and et products 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the barkot reserve forest 30 03ʹ52ʹʹ 30 10ʹ43ʹʹn 78 09ʹ 49ʹ 78 17ʹ 09ʹʹe uttarakhand india located in the

photosynthetic production with high par with the function f l 1 γ ϕ 1 where γ is the parameter for saturation with irradiance the model uses three storage components to track the daily soil water balance surfacial water due to interception on the canopy surface θsurf snow water θsnow and soil water storages θ all storage components are bucket models with the following equations θ s u r f k 1 θ s u r f k r k 1 e k s u r f f s u r f k θ s n o w k 1 θ s n o w k r k 0 e k s n o w m k θ k 1 θ k f s u r f k m k f k e k s o i l where the subscript k denotes day r 1 and r 0 are the rainfall and snowfall respectively in the present study precipitation as snow is taken to be zero f is the drainage m is the snowmelt f s u r f is the drainage from canopy surface to soil and e consists of components from each of the water storages interception of precipitation on the canopy surface occurs only upto the maximum surfacial storage capacity θsurf max beyond which the additional precipitation drains off to soil water storage θ when the effective field capacity of soil θfc is reached the additional water drains off as run off at a rate proportional to current daily soil water content above θfc f k θ k θ f c τ f in this equation τ is the delay parameter of drainage determines the proportional decrease of θ relative to θfc until it is reached the temperature acclimation

threshold s m a x c when the steady temperature level s m a x x 0 is reached canopy photosynthesis is no further constrained by temperature following the principle of one constraint on stomatal conductance the d and w modifiers are merged in this model selecting the minimum of the two functions assuming either vpd or soil water effect constraints canopy photosynthesis on any given day the model uses previous day s estimates for soil water and the present day s d to calculate the f modifier for the present day f d w p min f d f w p where f w p is derived from relative extractable water rew denoted here as w w θ θ w p θ f c θ w p where θ is soil water content θ w p is soil water content at wilting point θ f c is the soil water content at field capacity f w increases with increasing w between 0 and soil water stress threshold for photosynthesis ρp f w p m i n 1 w ρ p the co2 modifier accounts for the effect of ambient co2 concentration on photosynthesis this effect is accounted for in two ways a the co2 modifier represents the mean increase of gpp with increasing co2 c a f c o 2 1 c a c a 0 c a c a 0 c m b increasing co2 also influences stomatal conductance and it becomes less reactive to vpd and hence the model introduces a multiplier for κ sensitivity parameter of fd for gpp response to vpd in the f d modifier in the form of c a 0 c a c κ the daily et during a given day k e k is predicted as e k α p k f w p k ν d k 1 λ χ 1 f a p a r k ϕ k f w e k where α and χ are the linear parameters for transpiration and evaporation respectively the soil water modifier has a different effect on gpp and et and this difference in the et model is accounted for by ν the adjustment parameter λ was introduced to linearize the response of e on p under the effect of d the soil water modifier for et is slightly different in that it accounts for evaporation under dry soil and has its own soil stress threshold ρe f w e min 1 w ρ e the detailed description of the model can be found in peltoniemi et al 2015 2 3 datasets for the purpose of this study the model was calibrated using ec flux data from the bfs and modis satellite data from 2016 to 2018 and validation of the gpp and et estimates was carried out using independent available ec flux dataset of 2019 2020 2 3 1 eddy covariance data the eddy flux measurements of co2 and h2o have been collected since 2014 at the bfs pillai et al 2019 the daily meteorological data of air temperature c precipitation mm par vpd and carbon di oxide ppm used as input were obtained from the various instruments installed on the flux tower at bfs the ground observed gpp and et for the validation purpose were also obtained from bfs using ec technique watham et al 2020 gpp was inferred from net ecosystem exchange nee and et from latent heat le the daily measurements were calculated from the half hourly observations of covariance of fluctuations in the vertical wind velocity and the co2 and h2o concentrations measured at 10 hz after appropriate gap filling has been done watham et al 2014 2 3 2 modis satellite data the satellite data used in this study was acquired from the moderate imaging spectroradiometer modis terra satellite modis acquires data in 36 spectral bands from 450 nm to 2100 nm this data is of useful insight for global dynamics on the land and in the oceans it provides various products of forests and forest related parameters such as f apar vegetation indices gpp and et on a global scale 2 3 3 modis 8 day surface reflectance product the time series of f apar and enhanced vegetation index evi were derived from the surface reflectance datasets mod09a1 the surface reflectance product is an 8 day 500 m resolution product on a sinusoidal grid it is computed from the modis bands 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 with the bandwidths 648 nm 858 nm 470 nm 555 nm 1240 nm 1640 nm and 2130 nm respectively the f apar describes the stand information and the canopy structural component in the preles model it was derived as a function of leaf area index lai and variable atmospheric resistance index vari watham et al 2017b to counter the atmospheric cloud effects using the spectral bands as follows v a r i g r

along with land surface temperature lst data it normalizes the red band s reflectance as a function of the blue band s reflectance evi is used to assess the productivity as it includes the blue band also which accounts for variability in soil and vegetation background reflectance it was derived as follows e v i 2 5 n i r r e d n i r 6 r e d 7 5 b l u e 1 2 3 4 modis 8 day lst product the mod11a1 product provides lst and emissivity bands the daily time series of lst was obtained at 8 day 1 km resolution incorporation of lst aids during the photosynthetically inactive periods as temperature enables the model to capture the environmental stress on vegetation productivity and hence the model will closely follow the physiological aspects 2 3 5 modis 8 day gpp product the modis gpp product mod17a2h is a global productivity dataset at 8 days at 500 m pixel resolution it is designed to provide regular measure of terrestrial vegetation growth and productivity the product employs an lue type model to calculate gpp using the surface meteorological modis land cover and f apar lai modis provides a composite gpp data for every 8 days gc m 2 8d 1 this data was downloaded for the entire study period and later converted to 8 days average to correspond with the flux tower observation for comparison with preles and tg estimated gpp by dividing the values by 8 gc m 2 day 1 2 3 6 modis 8 day et product the modis et product mod16a2 500 m provides global terra net evapotranspiration and latent heat datasets at 500 m pixel resolution the et bands are a result of the sum of all 8 days within the composite period and the le bands are an average of all the 8 days in that composite period it uses the penman monteith equation to calculate the net et using daily meteorological reanalysis data and modis land cover and albedo modis provides a composite et data for every 8 days mm 8d 1 similar to gpp the modis et values were also converted to 8 days average to correspond with the flux tower observation for comparison with preles et by dividing the values by 8 mm day 1 2 4 methodology 2 4 1 site specific calibration of preles the preles model was calibrated for 21 site specific parameters the model was originally developed for the boreal forest and accordingly included snow parameters barkot reserve forest is completely devoid of snow and hence the snow related parameters were set to zero the environmental stress parameters concerning the local soil and species physiology were calibrated using field flux tower observed data the study area is dominated by moist sal forest and has a sandy loam soil texture the measures for soil depth effective field capacity permanent wilting point and drainage delay parameters of the soil modifier were obtained from the field measurements collected by the uttarakhand forest department in 2021 the potential light use efficiency transpiration efficiency evaporation parameter threshold for state of acclimation and threshold for maximum temperature the acclimation modifier reaches were obtained from the flux tower observations the remaining parameters were calibrated in accordance with these 2 4 2 estimation of gpp and et using preles the structural and meteorological data were used to simulate gpp and et for a single pixel where the barkot flux tower is located the predicted daily mean fluxes were validated against the flux tower observed gpp and et preles is a point model with the calibrated parameters the model was implemented for the entire study area as a loop function and the fluxes were estimated at the ecosystem scale the time series of the estimated values were rasterized and analysed for daily changes seasonal variability and annual patterns of the fluxes 2 4 3 temperature greenness model the temperature greenness tg model was implemented at barkot to estimate gpp and compare the model s performance with that of preles the tg model was developed by sims et al 2008 the gpp was defined as g p p s c a l e d l s t s c a l e d e v i m where m is the conversion coefficient with the unit gc m 2 day 1 lst and evi were scaled using the following equations 4 5 s c a l e d l s t min l s t t m i n t o p t t m i n t m a x l s t t m a x t o p t where min represents the minimum of the two linear functions in parenthesis tmin topt and tmax are minimum optimum and maximum temperature for photosynthesis respectively the optimum temperature was calculated using tower obtained gpp and temperature sims et al 2008 reported that around an evi of 0 1 gpp drops to zero this is accounted for by scaling the evi as 4 6 s c a l e d e v i e v i 0 1 a similar response of gpp to evi was observed in the study area the model is parameterized by estimating the conversion coefficient m for this purpose the flux tower observed gpp is plotted against the product of scaled lst and scaled evi and slope m is calculated srinet et al 2020 performed a similar study in the same study area and for the same study period the m scalar obtained in their study 38 97 gc m 2 day 1 was used in the tg algorithm to estimate gpp in the present study the tg model predicted gpp preles model predicted gpp and the modis obtained gpp were plotted against flux tower observed gpp and compared similarly preles predicted et and modis obtained et were plotted against flux tower observed et and compared 3 results 3 1 calibration of preles the model was parameterized using the flux tower measurements and the field observations we calibrated the model with three years data on meteorological variables from 2016 to 2018 a plausible range of variability of the parameters was taken as prior distributions and a series of combinations of these parameter values was used simultaneously in model calibration and the outputs were validated against the available data finally arriving at the set of values that is the best fit for the study area site and pft specific values were calculated from the field flux tower observations made at bfs these include soil depth effective field capacity permanent wilting point soil drainage light use efficiency transpiration efficiency evaporation parameter and the minimum and maximum temperatures for photosynthetic acclimations table 1 lists the parameters used in the study during calibration interaction between the parameters with each other was observed correlation between parameters indicates their combined effect and that they partially compensated each other s effect the highest parameter correlations were observed between potential light use efficiency β and irradiance saturation parameter γ followed by start of temperature acclimation xₒ and maximum temperature for acclimation smax and γ and the sensitivity parameter of f d for gpp response to vpd κ also in et model parameters between transpiration parameter α and evaporation parameter χ these parameter pairs complement each other s function and jointly control the ecosystem fluxes the light temperature and vpd modifiers had highest influence in defining the gpp and et fluxes the light use efficiency and the irradiance saturation parameter γ for gpp contributed the maximum to photosynthetic prediction and γ also had a pronounced effect on all the predictions especially on gpp the soil water parameters were also among the most sensitive parameters although their effect was less in the wet season jun oct all the parameters captured the seasonal variability of the fluxes correctly with an increased sensitivity during the dry seasons nov feb there was a general tendency of gpp to decrease with increasing γ and also increasing κ but the soil water stress threshold parameters ρp ρe highly defined the dry season this site specific calibration showed robust performance in predicting the photosynthetic activity and the water exchange of moist deciduous forest 3 2 estimation of the ecosystem fluxes using preles preles yielded mean daily measures of gpp and et from 2016 to 2020 fig 2 and the estimated fluxes agreed well with the observed fluxes 3 2 1 estimation of gross primary productivity the preles estimated gpp ranged from 1 09 to 19 73 gc m 2 day 1 it agreed well with the observed gpp r2 0 74 n 636 also evident from the low root mean square error rmse value of 1 87 gc m 2 day 1 and mean absolute percent error mape value of 24 51 fig 3 a the lowest gpp was recorded in january and february and it gradually started to increase from the end of march peaked during august and september and then gradually decreased from october precisely following the phenological pattern of the moist deciduous sal forest at barkot the mean daily estimated gpp was summed as a composite and compared with observed gpp table 2 the mean annual gpp computed using only complete year data for the study period was found to be mean std error 3118 66 201 22 gc m 2 year 1 the annual estimates of 2016 and 2017 did not show great variations but gpp in 2018 drastically dropped by approximately 600 gc m 2 year 1 3 2 2 estimation of evapotranspiration the estimated et ranged from 0 25 to 5 31 mm day 1 the goodness of fit of et predictions was weaker compared to gpp predictions on validation the model estimated et with an rmse of 0 78 mm day 1 and a mape of 27 51 and gave an r2 0 44 n 555 fig 3b et followed the trend corresponding to gpp the lowest et was recorded in january and february and it gradually started to increase from the end of march and peaked during august and september and then decreased from october the trend corresponded well with the observed et srinet et al 2022 the mean daily estimated et was summed as a composite and compared with observed et table 2 the mean annual et computed using only complete year data for the study period was found to be mean std error 674 84 38 15 mm year 1 3 3 estimation of gpp with tg model the 8 day average gpp was calculated from 2016 2020 using the tg model the m scalar value used in this study was 38 97 gc m 2 day 1 3 25 molc m 2 day 1 which is comparatively higher than the m values obtained at other deciduous forests srinet et al 2020 the high m value indicates the high productivity of the moist deciduous forests the estimated gpp ranged between 1 78 to 19 73 gc m 2 day 1 the mean monthly intra annual gpp for 2016 was mapped fig 4 the productivity was low during the dry season and started increasing from the end of may peaked during the growing season in august and september and then decreased from october slightly higher values were noted in february and november compared to the observed values further the preles and tg estimated gpp were compared with the modis gpp product and the preles estimated et was compared with the modis et product against the flux tower observed gpp and et respectively 3 3 1 comparison of gpp using different models the performance of estimated gpps and mod17 gpp were compared against ec flux tower observed gpp of 2019 2020 figs 5 6 on comparison between similar data points n 138 it was found that both preles and tg the models provided better results than the mod17 gpp product preles performed the best rmse 1 64 gc m 2 day 1 mape 18

all the gpps at 8 days averaged values with observed gpp of 2019 2020 3 3 2 comparison of et using different models the performance of preles estimated et and mod16 et were compared against the flux

deciduous sal forest mod16 et on the other hand highly underperformed at the study site rmse 2 29 mm day 1 mape 71 23 and the values ranged between 0 and 4 37 mm day 1 it showed remarkably underestimated values during the dry season and overestimated values during the growing season with many notable dips in the monsoons fig 8 a b shows the validation graphs for all the ets at 8 days averaged data with observed et of 2019 2020 4 discussion 4 1 calibration of the model preles the simplified ecosystem model is an ecologically based model with a wide applicability due to the feasibility of model inputs we tested the model s applicability to moist deciduous forest in india and calibrated it for the moist sal vegetation at barkot reserve forest model calibrations provided good fits for the study area especially for gpp while et showed slight overestimations at the start of the growing season the parameters of f w play an important role in the model by defining the soil type which is characteristic of vegetation and climate type soil moisture is a driver of evapotranspiration and the soil water content is determined by the soil water storage capacity soil depth θd field capacity θfc and wilting point θwp preles considers the contribution of soil moisture in predicting evapotranspiration which is seldom included in other ecosystem models peltoniemi et al 2015 the study area falls in the himalayan foothills and is characterized by moist deciduous forest type and sandy loam soil texture sandy loam soil structures have high water holding capacity and their soil depth usually varies between 1000 mm to 1700 mm effective field capacity is the amount of water that the soil retains after the excess of water from precipitation has drained off permanent wilting point is a threshold for dryness below which there is no water available for the plants soil reaches its θfc after the excess water has drained off sandy loam soils usually take only about 1 1 5 days to drain off after irrigation the model uses the feed in between θfc and θwp as relative extractible water rew and the initial level of soil water to calculate et and θ simultaneously where et has gpp as input the soil water storage parameters are very sensitive but they may play small role in the wet seasons since vpd and its parameters become controlling factors in the presence of excess moisture outside the leaf patane 2011 amitrano et al 2019 preles includes various modifiers that account for the environmental influence on all the predictions and the parameter response to seasonality the f s parameters define the acclimation of photosynthetic process to the seasonal and daily changes in the temperature deciduous forests need lower temperatures xₒ and lesser delay periods τ to start temperature acclimation unlike temperate evergreen and temperate deciduous forests tian et al 2020 the soil water stress threshold parameters ρp ρe account for drought conditions and majorly control the trend and maintain the pattern during the dry seasons the dry season fluxes are a reflection of the decreased soil moisture during the off season which limits the plant growth and productivity it also affects et when there is overall reduced available water for stomatal transpiration and soil evaporation soil water limits assimilation of co2 and transpiration affecting both gpp and et liu et al 2020b this stress becomes limiting when water affects stomatal conductance the threshold parameters account for water stress when the threshold for rew exceeds the physiological processes are affected and plants are water stressed or there is a soil water deficit which occurs when rew drops below the threshold level of 0 4 bréda et al 2006 between θwp and ρ f w has a positive linear relationship and after that the model assumes f w as 1 deciduous plants have less conservative strategy for water use choat et al 2012 and hence the sites dominated by deciduous species seem to be more vulnerable to damage from drought these threshold parameters and the temperature parameters have high site sensitivity and need to be carefully calibrated for newer sites they were set considering the impact of κ and λ which is the parameter for response of et to vpd keeping in view the coupling of vpd and soil water in nature gpp and et are highly sensitive to the light temperature and vpd scalars gilabert et al 2015 the f l plays an essential role in estimation of productivity the gpp prediction is sensitive to β and γ which were also highly correlated with each other yuan et al 2007 tian et al 2020 this is expected since γ determines the degree of non linearity of the response of photosynthesis to solar irradiance and β has a direct relationship with all variables and modifiers and the directly proportional relation between evapotranspiration and photosynthesis renders even et perceptive of the same parameters as gpp evapotranspiration showed a sensitive response to α and χ they are crucial parameters as they separate transpiration under stomatal control from evaporation from other surfaces especially when coupled with wider leaf areas or canopy densities peltoniemi et al 2015 transpiration and evaporation compensate each other and α and χ are linear multipliers of both the components respectively the high complimentary behavior of these parameters with each other makes them highly site specific higher values of these parameters markedly increase et which subsequently decreases θ larger et means less soil water content these parameters are also important for gpp while determining the dry season as they are connected to gpp and et through θ which has a positive linear effect on stomatal conductance reduced stomatal conductance reduces photosynthesis farquhar and sharkey 1982 hence reduced θ subsequently reduces gpp associated with this the dry season was also timely developed in the model since β is lower for deciduous species lu and zaung 2010 found that deciduous broad leaved forests show inverse water use efficiency the parameter α was designed with similar interpretation in the model as deciduous forests also show higher inherent water use efficiency beer et al 2009 and hence it was set at a very low level in the present study both these et parameters are also highly site sensitive and should be carefully calibrated to avoid any over and under estimations parameter for response of f d to vpd κ had some level of sensitivity on all predicted variables as it is fairly related to drought conditions due to its influence on stomatal conductance and et nie et al 2021 it also showed significant influence on gpp vpd negatively affects gpp liu et al 2020a and the sensitivity parameter κ is a negative value 4 2 estimation of gpp and et the model calibration was consistent and the validations demonstrated that preles can successfully and accurately estimate gpp and et in moist deciduous forest in india the study site represents a subtropical humid climate zone and is characterized as sal dominated moist deciduous forest the daily changes in the fluxes were well acknowledged by the model the model accurately captured the intra annual variability of gpp and et revealing the phenological pattern of moist deciduous sal forests attributed to the climatic variables the tropical deciduous forests reflect a marked influence of temperature and light on growth makela et al 2004 and the inclusion of various parameters related to temperature and light stress contribute to the spatio temporal phenological variation in estimated gpp and et of barkot forest the moist deciduous pfts experience leaf senescence in february and new leaf growth occurs during the end of march to april srinet et al 2020 the growing season in deciduous sal forests is from may to september and the dry season phenological changes occur between october and february watham et al 2017 preles simulated a similar pattern of productivity the photosynthetic production was less in january and february and started increasing from the end of march evapotranspiration corresponding with plant productivity owing to carbon uptake and release via stomata also showed a similar pattern it can be clearly seen in the plot that maximum carbon conversion and water exchange was during the peak seasons august and september the variation of gpp and et within an annual period reveals the effect of phenology and climatic factors on the fluxes this is attributed mostly to the temperature berry and bjorkman 1980 and the soil water stress threshold parameters which mark the seasonal variability and soil dryness soil moisture drives transpiration and when coupled with vpd it also influences stomatal opening buckley 2005 the soil dryness in the dry season complemented the decreasing trend of the fluxes in model prediction barkot experiences monsoon season from late june to september and this probably may be the reason for the seasonal trend of increased productivity and evapotranspiration during the months of july to september where the conditions for growth are favorable light temperature and precipitation the carbon conversion coefficient of the tg model used here was taken from a previous study srinet et al 2020 conducted at barkot for the same time period the estimated value was found to be comparatively higher than that for most deciduous forests the higher value indicates the humid condition of the study area and the high productivity associated with it this was also reflected in the simulations although a generally good performance was seen from tg model preles captured the intra annual variability more accurately this could be attributed to the various parameters included in the model tg overestimated gpp in the peak season and underestimated in the dry season many studies reported a very good performance from tg model while depicting seasonal variations dong et al 2017 watham et al 2017a srinet et al 2020 tang et al 2021 and others but similar issues in estimations were also reported in a few studies sims et al 2008 reported a high correlation coefficient between tg gpp and observed gpp for all the deciduous forests in their study but this was not seen in other study sites vegetation sites deciduous forests are noted to overestimate simulations of gpp from the tg model during the start of the growing season sims et al 2008 tang et al 2021 srinet et al 2020 a pattern also observed in the present study this may be attributed to the non linear relationship between gpp and scaledlst scaledevi another reason for underperformance of tg model could be due to lst soil surface temperature significantly affects lst sims et al 2008 during the dry season it is difficult to obtain sensible physiological activity from lst leading to underestimations of productivity errors introduced by lst may also be influenced by soil moisture soil moisture influences emissivity which has a strong impact on the magnitude of surface temperature sun and pinker 2004 most empirical models use entirely satellite data for simulation of vegetation productivity the major issue with this is the availability of spatial data in only coarse resolution these models in general average most of the topographic landscape features and neglect the effect of terrain and aspect on photosynthesis li et al 2016 xie and li 2020 these limitations render tg model capable in predicting gpp only in regions which do not have extensive in situ measurements and meteorological data generally tg model predicts seasonal variability with significant accuracy liu et al 2014 dong et al 2017 watham et al 2017a zhang et al 2019 srinet et al 2020 tang et al 2021 but only the temperature parameter and the vegetation cover do not exactly highlight the physiological processes of the vegetation this holds true for any empirical model for that matter where only observation and experience is used to establish an empirical relationship between any two or a few of the predictor variables lue models on the other hand consider various environmental stress scalars in their algorithms a universal set of parameters works well for most empirical models including satellite driven lue models even lue is an empirical relationship between gpp f apar and par but it considers the impact of a few environmental scalars which may vary between pfts and hence its performance has been noted to be better than non lue empirical models preles is also a series of empirical models but a good performance is reported from it on a regional scale as it can be optimized for different vegetation types and different climatic conditions minunno et al 2016 and tian et al 2020 it is assumed that tg showed slight underperformance owing to the input data and lack of proper understanding of the physiology and environment of the vegetation by the model when compared with preles the gpp estimated during this study as expected was higher than the npp net primary productivity reported using satellite data kumar et al 2019 reported npp of 0 1460 gc m 2 year 1 and npp of 800 gc m 2 year 1 for the indian himalayan forests bala et al 2013 the mean annual gpp of 3118 66 gc m 2 year 1 observed during this study well agrees with value reported form india similar gpp of 3358 167 gc m 2 year 1 for tropical dry deciduous forest of central india rodda et al 2021 lesser gpp of 2812 59 gc m 2 year 1 for broadleaf deciduous forest of northeast india and gpp of 1850 28 gc m 2 year 1 for coniferous evergreen forest of north india burman et al 2021 thus suggesting being a highly productive forest 4 3 comparison between models for the purpose of this study gpp was estimated using preles and tg and et was estimated using preles at barkot forest both the models provide better results over modis products preles gives the best estimation of gpp among the three models this is followed by tg model and modis gpp product highly underestimated gpp preles is a semi empirical model which uses an lue empirical algorithm to estimate gpp modis gpp product also uses an lue algorithm a typical difference between both the algorithms is the calculation of lue both the models use climatic variables to reduce maximum lue under unfavorable conditions although preles uses additional environmental scalars which monitor the inter linking effects between temperature soil water stress vapor pressure deficit and lue determination of lue across seasons and vegetation types poses a challenge on different models tg model on the other hand is an empirical model and gains merit by its reliability on entirely remote sensing data it employs a combination of evi and lst to estimate gpp tg has been considerably reported to give a good performance since evi is an indicator of greenness and stand structure and lst is a proxy of par and accounts for environmental scalars but it introduces uncertainties in modis reflectance and spatial resolution in a comparison between preles estimated et and modis et product preles yielded better results the preles estimates et using an empirical model following the gpp lue function of the model it calculates et as a function of canopy conductance and vpd of the air and considers daily gpp to be a good predictor of the daily sum of evapotranspiration acknowledging the relationship between soil water vpd and canopy conductance the model algorithm also takes account of the effect of vapor pressure and the differential effect of soil water stress on transpiration water use efficiency of vegetation and considers the effect of radiation on non stomatal surfaces modis uses the penman monteith equation to calculate et it separately incorporates functions for albedo lai f apar and land cover to account for effects of temperature canopy evaporation plant transpiration and soil evaporation overall preles was observed to estimate gpp and et with higher precision for the moist deciduous sal forest at barkot preles considers the influence of various environmental variables and scalars at the same time since gpp and et are not driven by only one parameter at a time the involvement of many physiological properties and climatic influencers at the same time brings out phenological variability more accurately 5 conclusion in this study we calibrated the preles model and estimated the gpp and et in the moist deciduous forest at barkot reserve forest uttarakhand india a combination of ec flux meteorological measurements and modis data were used to parameterize the model the model performance was good in the study site and the results were consistent with previous studies conducted here the mean annual gpp and et between 2016 and 2018 stood at 3118 66 201 22 gc m 2 year 1 and 674 84 38 15 mm year 1 mean std error respectively preles accurately captured the seasonality of the sal vegetation in terms of productivity the 8 day average gpp was estimated using tg model that reflected the highly productive nature of the study area overall the diurnal and seasonal variability of the fluxes was more accurately predicted by preles as compared with the tg model and the modis gpp and et products the results obtained in this study can be used for estimating the fluxes at other similar vegetation types and also aid in calibrating the model for newer sites and develop a deeper understanding of the indian ecosystems and their associated processes preles appears to be a better modeling approach for ecosystem fluxes as it simulates both gpp and et simultaneously and holds a potential to determine the capacity of different soil types to store and release water which remains a global problem

24288,traditional epidemiological models for managing disease risk face serious hurdles when applied to complex life cycle parasites that involve several host species echinococcus multilocularis em is such a parasite and the aetiological agent of a serious zoonosis alveolar echinococcosis affecting thousands of people every year worldwide the parasite is transmitted through predation of infectious intermediate hosts rodents by definitive hosts foxes coyotes definitive hosts are usually territorial with individual home ranges in spatially heterogeneous urban landscapes where they carry very diverse parasite load thus creating a highly heterogeneous distribution of the parasite in the urban environment to incorporate individual differences and spatial heterogeneity into an epidemiological model we developed calgary echinococcus multilocularis coyote agent based model cemca the cemca was developed to understand the processes and mechanisms that produces the heterogeneity in the transmission of em the model simulates behaviors of individual coyotes inhabiting the city of calgary as agents reproducing behavioral patterns such as their home ranges where and which prey species they hunt where they defecate and how they transmit em the agents perform all its behaviors in a simulation landscape that represent an actual calgary landscape that includes maps of natural habitats and small mammal assemblages the cemca proved to be highly sensitive to unobservable epidemiological parameters and although not fully matching the observed patterns it provided useful insights into the epidemiological processes of em moreover our experimental simulations supported the hypothesis that distribution of intermediate hosts and separation of habitats were the main causes of spatial heterogeneity in infection by integrating individual differences and spatial heterogeneity this study contributed to the understanding of the epidemiology of trophically transmitted parasite with complex life cycles notwithstanding requiring further work this approach holds many promises for further applications in preventative management of infectious diseases in urban landscapes graphical

belga et al 2017 cerda et al 2018 massolo 2019 massolo et al 2019 in the city of calgary alberta canada em has been detected among wild small mammals and coyotes at high prevalence catalano et al 2012 liccioli et al 2012 within the city there was large heterogeneity on the intensity of infection among individual hosts and in the prevalence of infection among different areas of the city and at different time of the year liccioli et al 2014 similar to what was observed in other parts of the world hansen et al 2004 while many studies have analyzed em epidemiology they usually focused on a single component of the system such as the survival of eggs in a natural environment veit et al 1995 or the behavior or spatial distribution of the host species guerra et al 2014 liccioli et al 2014 however components in the system can interact and affect the transmission of em including social groups and territoriality conner et al 2008 nunn et al 2008 landscape lane degraaf et al 2013 rushton et al 2000 and behavior barja and list 2014 liccioli et al 2015a how these components interact to determine the observed transmission patterns and prevalence is poorly understood yet such information is needed for managers to effectively allocate resources in reducing the risks of the disease to people nishina and ishikawa 2008 particularly in urban landscapes epidemiological models are essential in understanding predicting and managing disease risks traditional epidemiological models such as sir models were based on mass transaction models anderson and may 1982 which assess the transmission of a parasite at the population level these models generally assume all the individuals interact with each other homogenously and any individuality will average out at the population level i e mass action mccallum et al 2001 however it is becoming increasingly known that for many epidemiological systems including that of em transmission processes at an individual level have a disproportionate impact on host parasite dynamics lane degraaf et al 2013 lanzas and chen 2015 rushton et al 2000 white et al 2018a 2018b spatially explicit agent based models abm offer alternate methods for the analysis of epidemiological systems duan et al 2015 willem et al 2017 agent based models allow researchers to explicitly represent heterogeneity among individual hosts over heterogeneous landscape in this paper we describe a spatially explicit agent based model of transmission of complex life cycle parasites that are transmitted through a predator prey interaction using em among wild coyotes in the city of calgary urban area calgary echinococcus multilocularis coyote agent based model or cemca for short as a model the purpose of cemca was to understand the epidemiology and processes that result in the spatial heterogeneity of em prevalence in definitive hosts in an urban landscape we developed three non mutually exclusive hypotheses on how the spatial heterogeneities of dh prevalence were produced i differences in the small mammal assemblages and the proportion of susceptible species leads to between area differences in the prevalence among dh ih hypothesis ii different configuration of the local landscape creates differences in concentration or diffusion of dh activities i e behaviours that affect em transmission leading to higher prevalence of infections among dh in some areas more than the others local landscape configuration hypothesis iii separation between natural habitats in urban landscape limits the spread of infections between these areas maintaining the differences in prevalence among dh in different areas landscape connectivity hypothesis using the cemca we explored the possibilities for the processes creating the spatial heterogeneities in the system using these hypotheses as frameworks 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulation space extent and length the city of calgary is located in southwestern alberta canada 51 5 n 114 5 w in the foothills of the canadian rocky mountains it has a growing population of 1 24 million inhabitants and covers an area of 826 km2 the city has several rivers and creeks most notably bow river and elbow river that converge in the city the surfaces of these major rivers usually do not freeze over completely in winter forming a significant barrier to the wildlife movements the city has several parks with the total area of 13 133 ha 50 6 of which is classified as natural areas according to the city of calgary official homepage https www calgary ca sitepages cocis default aspx accessed may 2020 common habitats in parks and natural areas are grasslands in dry areas aspen forests in moderately well drained areas and willow shrublands in imperfectly drained areas the city of calgary 2014 we limited the spatial extent of our model and the number of coyotes to keep the computation time of the model manageable we focused our model around nosehill park nhp and bowmont park bm in northwest calgary fig 1 areas that are utilized by resident coyotes and where the prevalence estimates of em among coyotes showed high heterogeneity 63 07 in bm 17 28 in nhp liccioli et al 2014 2015b the extent of the simulation space was designated as the rectangular areas that encompass nhp bm and 5 km buffer around the two parks we considered the 5 km buffer as a reasonable buffer based on the literature report on their home range size and movement distance andelt and gipson 1979 gese et al 2012 the simulation was designed to run for 5 years in addition to one initiation year at the beginning to allow coyotes to learn the landscape we considered the simulation length of 5 years as enough time for epidemiological pattern to emerge after several transmission life cycles of em whose generation time can be estimated as roughly 4 12 months ishikawa et al 2003 2 2 model description a complete detailed model description following the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 2020 is provided in the supplementary material 1 the overall purpose of our model is to understand the epidemiology of em specifically we are addressing the following questions what are the possible processes and mechanisms that produce the observed heterogeneity of em transmission to consider our model realistic enough for its purpose we use the following patterns spatial patterns in prevalence among dhs seasonal patterns in the prevalence among dhs liccioli et al 2014 and patterns of em infection intensity among individual dhs catalano et al 2012 liccioli et al 2012 the model includes the following entities individual coyotes packs as collectives of the coyotes cells representing 50 m by 50 m land patch of habitat as collectives of the cells coyotes feces with em eggs or cohorts of em eggs individual ih cohorts of em worms inside dh and simulation environments the state variables characterizing these entities are listed in table 1 the spatial resolution is 50 m by 50 m square cells and temporal resolution is time step of 30 min the spatial extent is 380 cells by 318 cells or 19 km by 15 9 km encompassing two parks of nhp and bm and surrounding areas in the northwestern region of the city of calgary the temporal extent is six years of simulation the most important processes of the model which are repeated every time step are the behaviors of each coyote which are in the form of hunt travel or rest there is also decision making processes of decide purpose and decide action that a coyote may go through to decide which action to take and to what end once a coyote reaches the end of that action the coyote then goes through decision making processes again as the coyotes take actions they learn the landscape preys on infected ih and become infected and release em eggs through defecation once every 48 time steps i e once a day em agents go through processes that represent their life cycle such as egg production infection of small mammals and die as a result of exposure to environment the most important design concepts of the model are to make individual coyotes learn and adapt to their environments so that their behaviors reflect landscape features and their configurations including the small mammal assemblages and their distribution we predict that these interactions lead to emergence of the observed patterns of em transmissions the model is initialized with five packs of coyotes dens of two packs are placed in bm and three packs in nhp each pack consists of three coyotes of alpha male alpha female and beta individual of randomized sex one year of simulation is conducted for these coyotes to learn landscape before a main simulation starts where em entities are introduced em are introduced as worms infecting certain individual coyotes defined by the simulation scenarios small mammal assemblages are categorized into three types of type 1 modest overall density but with high proportion of species susceptible to the infection by em type 2 high density of most species of small mammals and thus has lower proportion of susceptible species and type 3 low density of small mammals in general the spatial distribution of the three types of assemblages were modeled mori et al 2019 and used as a map layer for the simulation fig 2 except in some of the simulation experiments 2 3 sensitivity analysis we investigated the sensitivity of mean infection prevalence of the last year of simulations to two unknown parameters running 10 simulations for each parameter combination one of the unknown parameters was the rate at which potential ihs contact em eggs in the field given the presence of egg containing feces in the cell egg contact rate in order to understand its impact on the transmission of em simulations were conducted with egg contact rates of 0 5 1 and 2 per small mammal per feces per day a second important but unknown component of the dynamics was how vulnerable an infective ih is to predation by coyotes compared to an uninfected small mammal due to infection symptoms or host manipulation by the parasite ih predation vervaeke et al 2006 manipulation of host behavior by parasites to increase the chance of transmission are known to occur in variety of parasite host systems thomas et al 2010 and it is suspected that em also manipulates ih to be more susceptible to predation by potential dh thus increasing the chance of transmission vervaeke et al 2006 to represent such manipulation a coefficient was introduced that multiplied the probability of an infective small mammal being detected and hunted by a coyote relative to a healthy small mammal of same species simulations were conducted with the ih predation coefficient of 1 2 5 and 10 times susceptible to the predation compared to a healthy small mammal see the supplementary material 1 for detail 2 4 validation for the validation of cemca s performance the results from the sensitivity analysis were used we adopted pattern oriented modelling approach grimm et al 1996 three known patterns of em epidemiology from the city of calgary were chosen for the validation purpose namely spatial patterns in prevalence among dhs seasonal patterns in the prevalence among dhs liccioli et al 2014 and patterns of em infection intensity among individual dhs catalano et al 2012 liccioli et al 2012 these patterns were quantified by overall mean and standard deviation in addition variance to mean ratio vmr was used as an index of the dispersion upton and cook 2014 in particular the simulated mean and standard deviation of the infection intensity was expected to be very different from observation as all the involved models were tentative therefore the characteristics of the dispersion were considered as an essential pattern of interest the notable pattern of dispersion of the infection intensity was the presence of few individuals with extremely high intensity compared to the population means guislain et al 2008 hofer et al 2000 yimam et al 2002 to see if such individuals were successfully simulated ratio of maximum to mean was used as a measurable index 2 5 experimental simulation we conducted experimental simulations to explore the three hypotheses using the cemca first small mammal assemblages of the area were manipulated to test ih hypothesis the experiments were conducted by assigning all the cells of natural land cover with one of the three assemblage types to be compared against the simulations with all three types of modeled distribution fig 2 these manipulations were combined with the parameter settings of egg contact rate of 0 5 or 1 per day and ih predation rate of 2 and 5 fold increase compared to the healthy small mammals as the parameter combinations that produced relatively realistic outcomes among those investigated in the above sensitivity analysis the simulations were repeated 10 times for each parameter and assemblage combination the results were analyzed by comparing the prevalence in the last year of the simulation if the ih hypothesis holds we would expect the simulations with different assemblage types to results in different prevalence with assemblage type 1 expected to result in highest prevalence mori et al 2019 in addition if the ih hypothesis was the only explanation for the spatial heterogeneity we would expect the similar prevalences in bm and nhp with the same assemblage types in both parks second the experiments were conducted with em introduced only in one of the parks in simulation to explore the possibility of landscape connectivity hypothesis this experiment was combined with the above experiment of changing the assemblage simulations of each combination was repeated 10 times the results were analyzed by comparing the overall prevalence and relative prevalence of bm and nhp if the landscape connectivity hypothesis can explain the spatial heterogeneity of em prevalence then we would expect the difference in the prevalence to persist for many years of simulation the resulting prevalences of experimental simulation were averaged by scenarios and were compared using simple t test on the jan 1st of the last year of the simulation when the prevalence among coyotes is expected to be high significance level was set at 0 05 3 results the sensitivity analysis suggested that both the egg contact rate and the ih predation had strong effects on the number of coyotes being infected table 2 at low egg contact rate and ih predation em transmission is rare and the parasite tended to die off early in the simulation while at high egg contact rate and ih predation the parasite became near ubiquitous 81 81 at highest the detailed results of validation are provided in the supplementary material 2 the average prevalence among dh between the bm and nhp table s2 5 and their average heterogeneity as calculated in standard deviations table s2 6 showed a close match to the previously published data liccioli et al 2014 in several parameter combinations however while the observed data consistently indicated bm to have higher prevalence than nhp liccioli et al 2014 the simulation resulted in nhp having higher prevalence than bm for example the parameter combination of 1 egg contact rate and 10x ih predation resulted in average prevalence of 45 39 se of 12 81 close match to the observed 40 18 prevalence in bm and nhp overall this parameter combination resulted in 19 85 se of 7 35 prevalence in simulated bm in close match not to observed bm but to observed in nhp 17 28 and 70 93 se of 12 16 in simulated nhp in close match not to observed nhp but to observed bm 63 07 the mean prevalence among dh averaged by the seasons were close to the observed prevalence averaged by seasons in some parameter combinations table s2 7 however the seasonal heterogeneities were much lower in the simulation than in the observed table s2 8 the simulations correctly displayed spring as being the season with highest prevalence although they could not correctly display the differences among winter summer or fall prevalence tables s3 9 s3 12 liccioli et al 2014 for example the parameter combination of 1 egg contact rate and 10x ih predation resulted in average prevalence se of 58 02 10 14 48 53 8 75 42 44 7 69 and 53 33 9 33 in simulated spring summer fall and winter respectively which show less heterogeneity than observed 43 47 10 52 21 80 and 19 40 in spring summer fall and winter respectively simulated mean intensity of infection among individual dh were order of magnitudes greater than those of observed table s2 13 the mean of the standard deviation table s2 14 and vmr table s2 15 were also greater in simulations by an order of magnitude however means of the max to mean ratio in simulations were smaller than observed table s2 16 for example the parameter combination of 1 egg contact rate and 10x ih predation resulted in average se infection intensity of 2 244 909 454 372 5 compared to observed intensity of 23 726 6 the simulated mean se vmr of 3 360 288 184 866 3 compared to observed 120 848 92 and the simulated maximum to mean ratio of 6 58 0 47 compared to observed 10 91 in the experiment manipulating the small mammal assemblages simulations with only assemblage type 1 or 3 resulted in em dying out even at higher transmission parameters the simulations with only assemblage type 2 on the other hand resulted in much higher prevalence than the simulations with the modelled assemblage distribution e g 78 04 in assemblage type 2 compared to 10 27 in modelled assemblage distribution with egg contact rate of 1 and ih predation of x5 table 3 in every parameter combination egg contact rate ih predation of 0 5 x2 0 5 x5 1 x2 and 1 x5 the prevalence of simulation with only assemblage 2 38 32 60 03 80 00 100 00 was significantly higher than the prevalence of simulations with modelled assemblage distribution 1 03 2 14 12 23 31 92 table s2 17 when all the small mammal assemblage was unified across the simulation landscape there were occasions where bm had higher average prevalence than nhp however the differences between the prevalence in two parks were not significant on those occasions table s2 18 in most scenarios of the experiment introducing em only to bm or to nhp at the start of simulations they mostly resulted in the higher prevalence in the park where em was introduced even after 4 years of transmissions table 4 though the differences were often not significant table s2 19 in some cases the prevalence did not differ between parks because the parasite died out as in the scenarios with gg contact rate of 0 5 and ih predation of x2 and em introduction in nhp where the prevalence were 0 on both parks in other cases there was no differences between parks because prevalence became saturated on both parks as in the case of nhp at egg contact rate of 1 and ih predation of x5 and em introduction in nhp where the prevalence were 83 31 and 88 94 in bm and nhp respectively the parasites tended to result in lower overall prevalence in 5 years if it was introduced to bm simulations with only small mammal assemblage type 2 had greater prevalence 4 discussion the development of an agent based model of echinococcus multilocularis transmission in a north american metropolis calgary ca cemca allowed to incorporate definitive host coyotes individual differences as well as the spatial heterogeneity of the urban landscape moreover it allowed the assessment of the sensitivity of the system to parameters that are not known from prior studies indicating that the ih infection rate and susceptibility to predation have a strong influence on the transmission of em the cemca results diverged in some observed patterns but showed several key observed patterns confirming the overall validity of the cemca more relevantly the cemca indicated that all the tested factors ih assemblage local scale configuration and landscape connectivity explained the spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence of em suggesting that the spatial heterogeneity of em infections in definitive hosts is likely caused by a multi factorial process among the insights gained from the cemca was that em seems to manipulate ih in our simulations em frequently died out when the ih had no increase in the susceptibility to predation and egg contact rate is low suggesting that ih manipulation is likely necessary for their prolonged presence similar conclusions were drawn by vervaeke et al 2006 whose mathematical model suggest that such manipulation can explains the observed resilience of em these results indicate the need for future research on the mechanisms and effects of the parasites manipulation of ihs and the rate of small mammal to ingest em egg in the natural condition the results of the validations of the epidemiological patterns in the cemca indicated that even though the model could not display the observed transmission patterns of em precisely the model still displayed the overall trends and tendency of the observation and helped formulating alternative hypotheses for example one of the most notable differences between the simulations and observations was the relative amount of infection between the two key natural parks supplementary material s2 4 because the primary purpose of this study was to understand the mechanisms and processes causing the spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence of em this result was of particular interest the higher prevalence among simulated coyote in nhp than in bm may be explained by the larger areas of assemblage type 2 fig 2 which were better suited for em transmission than other assemblages as shown in the results of experiments manipulating the small mammal assemblage types table 3 however this is in contrast to mori et al 2019 where assemblage type 1 was associated with higher prevalence than assemblage type 2 in mori et al 2019 it was speculated that assemblage type 1 was associated with higher prevalence of em because of lower overall abundance of small mammals and higher proportion of susceptible species increasing the chance of hunting coyotes to encounter a prey susceptible to em the assemblage type 2 was speculated to have lower prevalence because higher overall abundance of small mammals was causing dilution effects civitello et al 2015 mori et al 2019 however while the dilution effects are considered likely to play a role in the transmission of em other factors such as density dependent prey preference availability of other food source and omnivorous and flexible diets can complicate the transmission process baudrot et al 2016 raoul et al 2015 coyotes are highly omnivorous and mobile gese et al 2012 liccioli et al 2015a and is known to rely on other food sources when the small mammals are less abundant murray et al 2015 coyotes can choose to hunt where the preys are abundant rather than hunt at places with lower prey abundance or decides to feed on food sources other than small mammals such behaviors were not incorporated in the cemca but potentially have significant effect on the actual transmission the higher prevalence among observed coyotes in bm may be because the coyote activities were concentrated in small prey abundant areas rather than because of the large areas of assemblage type 1 for more thorough discussion on the validation see the supplementary material 2 while the discrepancies between simulated and observed patterns indicate that cemca was not always successful in reproducing the patterns observed for the actual transmission of em among coyotes in the city of calgary these results are the logical outcome of the assumptions and knowledge that went into building the cemca boschetti et al 2011 the discrepancies therefore help us in reassessing our assumptions and knowledges although the current model outcomes are not reliable predictions of the real system it can still be useful for exploring the systems and test hypotheses that are not possible with a real system one approach is to run experiments with the model to test alternate hypotheses that may produce the heterogeneities we observe in real system grimm and railsback 2005 the first experiment changing the small mammal assemblage strongly supported the ih hypothesis the small mammal assemblages seem to play very strong role in the transmission of em however the results of the experiment were contrary to the assumption behind the ih hypothesis dilution effect where the higher proportion of the susceptible prey promotes the transmission of the parasite civitello et al 2015 mori et al 2019 the dilution effect would be expected if the predation of the coyotes were based on the density of the prey baudrot et al 2016 however coyotes in calgary are known to consume meadow voles more often than expected from their abundance in the field liccioli et al 2015a this preference in prey species is incorporated in the behaviors of coyote in the cemca acting as a counter to the dilution effect the higher density of small mammals in assemblage type 2 may also allow coyotes to consume more small mammals and increase the chance of infection further experimentation manipulating the prey preference of coyotes may shed light on when the dilution effect becomes important experiments changing the small mammal assemblages seemed to also support the local landscape configuration hypothesis the experiment occasionally resulted in bm having higher prevalence than nhp though not significantly which never occurred with the simulations using the modelled small mammal assemblage distribution fig 2 however the difference in prevalence between the two parks in those occasions wwere not significant more work is required before we can interpret these results the results of second experiment strongly supported the landscape connectivity hypothesis even after four years of simulated em transmission among coyotes the simulations usually showed higher em prevalence in the park where em was introduced at the start of the simulation table 4 this difference in prevalence is likely to disappear if the simulations were run for longer period however the current version of cemca is not designed for longer simulations lacking in coyote mortality in reality annual survival rate of coyotes in urban areas are reported in the range of 62 74 gehrt 2007 though long time resident coyotes are likely to have higher survival rate murray and st clair 2015 combining demographic model with an epidemiological model is complicated and difficult task dealing with two processes that occur at different time scale bradshaw et al 2012 and spatial scale and was not achieved in this study if we are to successfully add realistic mortality and replacement of coyotes to the cemca we would expect an increased chance of local extinction of em due to the temporary disappearance of hosts leading to renewed spatial heterogeneity in prevalence it is known that heterogeneous landscape and animal movements has significant influence on the epidemiology among wildlife and causes spatial heterogeneity lane degraaf et al 2013 real and biek 2007 and yet epidemiological model with heterogeneous landscape remains rare this experiment highlights the importance of using spatially explicit abms which contrarily to most of the epidemiological models of em transmission are able to integrate the complexity of the real urban landscape although it was not included in this study another possible experiment of interest with cemca is to test the effectiveness of the use of anthelminthic baits to deworm the coyotes often used by policy makers to reduce the risks of alveolar echinococcosis a similar study was conducted by nishina and ishikawa 2008 but their study did not include the factor of space in their analysis or individuality among hosts the cemca can add spatial factors and address their integrated effects and complexity simulation experiments could be conducted to model the treatment with anthelminthic baits in one or more high prevalence area s to see if they are effective on the local areas and or on the transmission of the parasite in the whole urban landscape moreover we could test the length of the continued application of anthelminthic baits needed to be effective and time it would take for the parasite returns to the area once the application of the anthelminthic bait is ended 5 conclusions in modelling epidemiological systems spatially explicit abms hold great advantage over traditional models in that they can simulate behaviors and spatial factors that are considered important in the transmission of parasites whereas studies using agent based models for em transmissions are not new e g nishina and ishikawa 2008 only few studies modelled the transmission of parasites in a spatially explicit manner in complex heterogeneous landscapes e g lane degraaf et al 2013 and to the best of our knowledge no such study exists for parasites with complex life cycles transmitted through a predator prey system white et al 2018b in their review stated that the modelling of parasites that features complex life cycles effects of urbanization movement ecology and individual heterogeneity of hosts are rare however in many epidemiological systems those features can be the key elements in understanding the transmission processes in the cemca we tried to incorporate most of these elements despite having shortcomings in reproducing the observed patterns we believe that the cemca is promising for understanding the em epidemiology and applications in preventative management of infectious diseases particularly in

24288,traditional epidemiological models for managing disease risk face serious hurdles when applied to complex life cycle parasites that involve several host species echinococcus multilocularis em is such a parasite and the aetiological agent of a serious zoonosis alveolar echinococcosis affecting thousands of people every year worldwide the parasite is transmitted through predation of infectious intermediate hosts rodents by definitive hosts foxes coyotes definitive hosts are usually territorial with individual home ranges in spatially heterogeneous urban landscapes where they carry very diverse parasite load thus creating a highly heterogeneous distribution of the parasite in the urban environment to incorporate individual differences and spatial heterogeneity into an epidemiological model we developed calgary echinococcus multilocularis coyote agent based model cemca the cemca was developed to understand the processes and mechanisms that produces the heterogeneity in the transmission of em the model simulates behaviors of individual coyotes inhabiting the city of calgary as agents reproducing behavioral patterns such as their home ranges where and which prey species they hunt where they defecate and how they transmit em the agents perform all its behaviors in a simulation landscape that represent an actual calgary landscape that includes maps of natural habitats and small mammal assemblages the cemca proved to be highly sensitive to unobservable epidemiological parameters and although not fully matching the observed patterns it provided useful insights into the epidemiological processes of em moreover our experimental simulations supported the hypothesis that distribution of intermediate hosts and separation of habitats were the main causes of spatial heterogeneity in infection by integrating individual differences and spatial heterogeneity this study contributed to the understanding of the epidemiology of trophically transmitted parasite with

action mccallum et al 2001 however it is becoming increasingly known that for many epidemiological systems including that of em transmission processes at an individual level have a disproportionate impact on host parasite dynamics lane degraaf et al 2013 lanzas and chen 2015 rushton et al 2000 white et al 2018a 2018b spatially explicit agent based models abm offer alternate methods for the analysis of epidemiological systems duan et al 2015 willem et al 2017 agent based models allow researchers to explicitly represent heterogeneity among individual hosts over heterogeneous landscape in this paper we describe a spatially explicit agent based model of transmission of complex life cycle parasites that are transmitted through a predator prey interaction using em among wild coyotes in the city of calgary urban area calgary echinococcus multilocularis coyote agent based model or cemca for short as a model the purpose of cemca was to understand the epidemiology and processes that result in the spatial heterogeneity of em prevalence in definitive hosts in an urban landscape we developed three non mutually exclusive hypotheses on how the spatial heterogeneities of dh prevalence were produced i differences in the small mammal assemblages and the proportion of susceptible species leads to between area differences in the prevalence among dh ih hypothesis ii different configuration of the local landscape creates differences in concentration or diffusion of dh activities i e behaviours that affect em transmission leading to higher prevalence of infections among dh in some areas more than the others local landscape configuration hypothesis iii separation between natural habitats in urban landscape limits the spread of infections between these areas maintaining the differences in prevalence among dh in different areas landscape connectivity hypothesis using the cemca we explored the possibilities for the processes creating the spatial heterogeneities in the system using these hypotheses as frameworks 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulation space extent and length the city of calgary is located in southwestern alberta canada 51 5 n 114 5 w in the foothills of the canadian rocky mountains it has a growing population of 1 24 million inhabitants and covers an area of 826 km2 the city has several rivers and creeks most notably bow river and elbow river that converge in the city the surfaces of these major rivers usually do not freeze over completely in winter forming a significant barrier to the wildlife movements the city has several parks with the total area of 13 133 ha 50 6 of which is classified as natural areas according to the city of calgary official homepage https www calgary ca sitepages cocis default aspx accessed may 2020 common habitats in parks and natural areas are grasslands in dry areas aspen forests in moderately well drained areas and willow shrublands in imperfectly drained areas the city of calgary 2014 we limited the spatial extent of our model and the number of coyotes to keep the computation time of the model manageable we focused our model around nosehill park nhp and bowmont park bm in northwest calgary fig 1 areas that are utilized by resident coyotes and where the prevalence estimates of em among coyotes showed high heterogeneity 63 07 in bm 17 28 in nhp liccioli et al 2014 2015b the extent of the simulation space was designated as the rectangular areas that encompass nhp bm and 5 km buffer around the two parks we considered the 5 km buffer as a reasonable buffer based on the literature report on their home range size and movement distance andelt and gipson 1979 gese et al 2012 the simulation was designed to run for 5 years in addition to one initiation year at the beginning to allow coyotes to learn the landscape we considered the simulation length of 5 years as enough time for epidemiological pattern to emerge after several transmission life cycles of em whose generation time can be estimated as roughly 4 12 months ishikawa et al 2003 2 2 model description a complete detailed model description following the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 2020 is provided in the supplementary material 1 the overall purpose of our model is to understand the epidemiology of em specifically we are addressing the following questions what are the possible processes and mechanisms that produce the observed heterogeneity of em transmission to consider our model realistic enough for its purpose we use the following patterns spatial patterns in prevalence among dhs seasonal patterns in the prevalence among dhs liccioli et al 2014 and patterns of em infection intensity among individual dhs catalano et al 2012 liccioli et al 2012 the model includes the following entities individual coyotes packs as collectives of the coyotes cells representing 50 m by 50 m land patch of habitat as collectives of the cells coyotes feces with em eggs or cohorts of em eggs individual ih cohorts of em worms inside dh and simulation environments the state variables characterizing these entities are listed in table 1 the spatial resolution is 50 m by 50 m square cells and temporal resolution is time step of 30 min the spatial extent is 380 cells by 318 cells or 19 km by 15 9 km encompassing two parks of nhp and bm and surrounding areas in the northwestern region of the city of calgary the temporal extent is six years of simulation the most important processes of the model which are repeated every time step are the behaviors of each coyote which are in the form of hunt travel or rest there is also decision making processes of decide purpose and decide action that a coyote may go through to decide which action to take and to what end once a coyote reaches the end of that action the coyote then goes through decision making processes again as the coyotes take actions they learn the landscape preys on infected ih and become infected and release em eggs through defecation once every 48 time steps i e once a day em agents go through processes that represent their life cycle such as egg production infection of small mammals and die as a result of exposure to environment the most important design concepts of the model are to make individual coyotes learn and adapt to their environments so that their behaviors reflect landscape features and their configurations including the small mammal assemblages and their distribution we predict that these interactions lead to emergence of the observed patterns of em transmissions the model is initialized with five packs of coyotes dens of two packs are placed in bm and three packs in nhp each pack consists of three coyotes of alpha male alpha female and beta individual of randomized sex one year of simulation is conducted for these coyotes to learn landscape before a main simulation starts where em entities are introduced em are introduced as worms infecting certain individual coyotes defined by the simulation scenarios small mammal assemblages are categorized into three types of type 1 modest overall density but with high proportion of species susceptible to the infection by em type 2 high density of most species of small mammals and thus has lower proportion of susceptible species and type 3 low density of small mammals in general the spatial distribution of the three types of assemblages were modeled mori et al 2019 and used as a map layer for the simulation fig 2 except in some of the simulation experiments 2 3 sensitivity analysis we investigated the sensitivity of mean infection prevalence of the last year of simulations to two unknown parameters running 10 simulations for each parameter combination one of the unknown parameters was the rate at which potential ihs contact em eggs in the field given the presence of egg containing feces in the cell egg contact rate in order to understand its impact on the transmission of em simulations were conducted with egg contact rates of 0 5 1 and 2 per small mammal per feces per day a second important but unknown component of the dynamics was how vulnerable an infective ih is to predation by coyotes compared to an uninfected small mammal due to infection symptoms or host manipulation by the parasite ih predation vervaeke et al 2006 manipulation of host behavior by parasites to increase the chance of transmission are known to occur in variety of parasite host systems thomas et al 2010 and it is suspected that em also manipulates ih to be more susceptible to predation by potential dh thus increasing the chance of transmission vervaeke et al 2006 to represent such manipulation a coefficient was introduced that multiplied the probability of an infective small mammal being detected and hunted by a coyote relative to a healthy small mammal of same species simulations were conducted with the ih predation coefficient of 1 2 5 and 10 times susceptible to the predation compared to a healthy small mammal see the supplementary material 1 for detail 2 4 validation for the validation of cemca s performance the results from the sensitivity analysis were used we adopted pattern oriented modelling approach grimm et al 1996 three known patterns of em epidemiology from the city of calgary were chosen for the validation purpose namely spatial patterns in prevalence among dhs seasonal patterns in the prevalence among dhs liccioli et al 2014 and patterns of em infection intensity among individual dhs catalano et al 2012 liccioli et al 2012 these patterns were quantified by overall mean and standard deviation in addition variance to mean ratio vmr was used as an index of the dispersion upton and cook 2014 in particular the simulated mean and standard deviation of the infection intensity was expected to be very different from observation as all the involved models were tentative therefore the characteristics of the dispersion were considered as an essential pattern of interest the notable pattern of dispersion of the infection intensity was the presence of few individuals with extremely high intensity compared to the population means guislain et al 2008 hofer et al 2000 yimam et al 2002 to see if such individuals were successfully simulated ratio of maximum to mean was used as a measurable index 2 5 experimental simulation we conducted experimental simulations to explore the three hypotheses using the cemca first small mammal assemblages of the area were manipulated to test ih hypothesis the experiments were conducted by assigning all the cells of natural land cover with one of the three assemblage types to be compared against the simulations with all three types of modeled distribution fig 2 these manipulations were combined with the parameter settings of egg contact rate of 0 5 or 1 per day and ih predation rate of 2 and 5 fold increase compared to the healthy small mammals as the parameter combinations that produced relatively realistic outcomes among those investigated in the above sensitivity analysis the simulations were repeated 10 times for each parameter and assemblage combination the results were analyzed by comparing the prevalence in the last year of the simulation if the ih hypothesis holds we would expect the simulations with different assemblage types to results in different prevalence with assemblage type 1 expected to result in highest prevalence mori et al 2019 in addition if the ih hypothesis was the only explanation for the spatial heterogeneity we would expect the similar prevalences in bm and nhp with the same assemblage types in both parks second the experiments were conducted with em introduced only in one of the parks in simulation to explore the possibility of landscape connectivity hypothesis this experiment was combined with the above experiment of changing the assemblage simulations of each combination was repeated 10 times the results were analyzed by comparing the overall prevalence and relative prevalence of bm and nhp if the landscape connectivity hypothesis can explain the spatial heterogeneity of em prevalence then we would expect the difference in the prevalence to persist for many years of simulation the resulting prevalences of experimental simulation were averaged by scenarios and were compared using simple t test on the jan 1st of the last year of the simulation when the prevalence among coyotes is expected to be high significance level was set at 0 05 3 results the sensitivity analysis suggested that both the egg contact rate and the ih predation had strong effects on the number of coyotes being infected table 2 at low egg contact rate and ih predation em transmission is rare and the parasite tended to die off early in the simulation while at high egg contact rate and ih predation the parasite became near ubiquitous 81 81 at highest the detailed results of validation are provided in the supplementary material 2 the average prevalence among dh between the bm and nhp table s2 5 and their average heterogeneity as calculated in standard deviations table s2 6 showed a close match to the previously published data liccioli et al 2014 in several parameter combinations however while the observed data consistently indicated bm to have higher prevalence than nhp liccioli et al 2014 the simulation resulted in nhp having higher prevalence than bm for example the parameter combination of 1 egg contact rate and 10x ih predation resulted in average prevalence of 45 39 se of 12 81 close match to the observed 40 18 prevalence in bm and nhp overall this parameter combination resulted in 19 85 se of 7 35 prevalence in simulated bm in close match not to observed bm but to observed in nhp 17 28 and 70 93 se of 12 16 in simulated nhp in close match not to observed nhp but to observed bm 63 07 the mean prevalence among dh averaged by the seasons were close to the observed prevalence averaged by seasons in some parameter combinations table s2 7 however the seasonal heterogeneities were much lower in the simulation than in the observed table s2 8 the simulations correctly displayed spring as being the season with highest prevalence although they could not correctly display the differences among winter summer or fall prevalence tables s3 9 s3 12 liccioli et al 2014 for example the parameter combination of 1 egg contact rate and 10x ih predation resulted in average prevalence se of 58 02 10 14 48 53 8 75 42 44 7 69 and 53 33 9 33 in simulated spring summer fall and winter respectively which show less heterogeneity than observed 43 47 10 52 21 80 and 19 40 in spring summer fall and winter respectively simulated mean intensity of infection among individual dh were order of magnitudes greater than those of observed table s2 13 the mean of the standard deviation table s2 14 and vmr table s2 15 were also greater in simulations by an order of magnitude however means of the max to mean ratio in simulations were smaller than observed table s2 16 for example the parameter combination of 1 egg contact rate and 10x ih predation resulted in average se infection intensity of 2 244 909 454 372 5 compared to observed intensity of 23 726 6 the simulated mean se vmr of 3 360 288 184 866 3 compared to observed 120 848 92 and the simulated maximum to mean ratio of 6 58 0 47 compared to observed 10 91 in the experiment manipulating the small mammal assemblages simulations with only assemblage type 1 or 3 resulted in em dying out even at higher transmission parameters the simulations with only assemblage type 2 on the other hand resulted in much higher prevalence than the simulations with the modelled assemblage distribution e g 78 04 in assemblage type 2 compared to 10 27 in modelled assemblage distribution with egg contact rate of 1 and ih predation of x5 table 3 in every parameter combination egg contact rate ih predation of 0 5 x2 0 5 x5 1 x2 and 1 x5 the prevalence of simulation with only assemblage 2 38 32 60 03 80 00 100 00 was significantly higher than the prevalence of simulations with modelled assemblage distribution 1 03 2 14 12 23 31 92 table s2 17 when all the small mammal assemblage was unified across the simulation landscape there were occasions where bm had higher average prevalence than nhp however the differences between the prevalence in two parks were not significant on those occasions table s2 18 in most scenarios of the experiment introducing em only to bm or to nhp at the start of simulations they mostly resulted in the higher prevalence in the park where em was introduced even after 4 years of transmissions table 4 though the differences were often not significant table s2 19 in some cases the prevalence did not differ between parks because the parasite died out as in the scenarios with gg contact rate of 0 5 and ih predation of x2 and em introduction in nhp where the prevalence were 0 on both parks in other cases there was no differences between parks because prevalence became saturated on both parks as in the case of nhp at egg contact rate of 1 and ih predation of x5 and em introduction in nhp where the prevalence were 83 31 and 88 94 in bm and nhp respectively the parasites tended to result in lower overall prevalence in 5 years if it was introduced to bm simulations with only small mammal assemblage type 2 had greater prevalence 4 discussion the development of an agent based model of echinococcus multilocularis transmission in a north american metropolis calgary ca cemca allowed to incorporate definitive host coyotes individual differences as well as the spatial heterogeneity of the urban landscape moreover it allowed the assessment of the sensitivity of the system to parameters that are not known from prior studies indicating that the ih infection rate and susceptibility to predation have a strong influence on the transmission of em the cemca results diverged in some observed patterns but showed several key observed patterns confirming the overall validity of the cemca more relevantly the cemca indicated that all the tested factors ih assemblage local scale configuration and landscape connectivity explained the spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence of em suggesting that the spatial heterogeneity of em infections in definitive hosts is likely caused by a multi factorial process among the insights gained from the cemca was that em seems to manipulate ih in our simulations em frequently died out when the ih had no increase in the susceptibility to predation and egg contact rate is low suggesting that ih manipulation is likely necessary for their prolonged presence similar conclusions were drawn by vervaeke et al 2006 whose mathematical model suggest that such manipulation can explains the observed resilience of em these results indicate the need for future research on the mechanisms and effects of the parasites manipulation of ihs and the rate of small mammal to ingest em egg in the natural condition the results of the validations of the epidemiological patterns in the cemca indicated that even though the model could not display the observed transmission patterns of em precisely the model still displayed the overall trends and tendency of the observation and helped formulating alternative hypotheses for example one of the most notable differences between the simulations and observations was the relative amount of infection between the two key natural parks supplementary material s2 4 because the primary purpose of this study was to understand the mechanisms and processes causing the spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence of em this result was of particular interest the higher prevalence among simulated coyote in nhp than in bm may be explained by the larger areas of assemblage type 2 fig 2 which were better suited for em transmission than other assemblages as shown in the results of experiments manipulating the small mammal assemblage types table 3 however this is in contrast to mori et al 2019 where assemblage type 1 was associated with higher prevalence than assemblage type 2 in mori et al 2019 it was speculated that assemblage type 1 was associated with higher prevalence of em because of lower overall abundance of small mammals and higher proportion of susceptible species increasing the chance of hunting coyotes to encounter a prey susceptible to em the assemblage type 2 was speculated to have lower prevalence because higher overall abundance of small mammals was causing dilution effects civitello et al 2015 mori et al 2019 however while the dilution effects are considered likely to play a role in the transmission of em other factors such as density dependent prey preference availability of other food source and omnivorous and flexible diets can complicate the transmission process baudrot et al 2016 raoul et al 2015 coyotes are highly omnivorous and mobile gese et al 2012 liccioli et al 2015a and is known to rely on other food sources when the small mammals are less abundant murray et al 2015 coyotes can choose to hunt where the preys are abundant rather than hunt at places with lower prey abundance or decides to feed on food sources other than small mammals such behaviors were not incorporated in the cemca but potentially have significant effect on the actual transmission the higher prevalence among observed coyotes in bm may be because the coyote activities were concentrated in small prey abundant areas rather than because of the large areas of assemblage type 1 for more thorough discussion on the validation see the supplementary material 2 while the discrepancies between simulated and observed patterns indicate that cemca was not always successful in reproducing the patterns observed for the actual transmission of em among coyotes in the city of calgary these results are the logical outcome of the assumptions and knowledge that went into building the cemca boschetti et al 2011 the discrepancies therefore help us in reassessing our assumptions and knowledges although the current model outcomes are not reliable predictions of the real system it can still be useful for exploring the systems and test hypotheses that are not possible with a real system one approach is to run experiments with the model to test alternate hypotheses that may produce the heterogeneities we observe in real system grimm and railsback 2005 the first experiment changing the small mammal assemblage strongly supported the ih hypothesis the small mammal assemblages seem to play very strong role in the transmission of em however the results of the experiment were contrary to the assumption behind the ih hypothesis dilution effect where the higher proportion of the susceptible prey promotes the transmission of the parasite civitello et al 2015 mori et al 2019 the dilution effect would be expected if the predation of the coyotes were based on the density of the prey baudrot et al 2016 however coyotes in calgary are known to consume meadow voles more often than expected from their abundance in the field liccioli et al 2015a this preference in prey species is incorporated in the behaviors of coyote in the cemca acting as a counter to the dilution effect the higher density of small mammals in assemblage type 2 may also allow coyotes to consume more small mammals and increase the chance of infection further experimentation manipulating the prey preference of coyotes may shed light on when the dilution effect becomes important experiments changing the small mammal assemblages seemed to also support the local landscape configuration hypothesis the experiment occasionally resulted in bm having higher prevalence than nhp though not significantly which never occurred with the simulations using the modelled small mammal assemblage distribution fig 2 however the difference in prevalence between the two parks in those occasions wwere not significant more work is required before we can interpret these results the results of second experiment strongly supported the landscape connectivity hypothesis even after four years of simulated em transmission among coyotes the simulations usually showed higher em prevalence in the park where em was introduced at the start of the simulation table 4 this difference in prevalence is likely to disappear if the simulations were run for longer period however the current version of cemca is not designed for longer simulations lacking in coyote mortality in reality annual survival rate of coyotes in urban areas are reported in the range of 62 74 gehrt 2007 though long time resident coyotes are likely to have higher survival rate murray and st clair 2015 combining demographic model with an epidemiological model is complicated and difficult task dealing with two processes that occur at different time scale bradshaw et al 2012 and spatial scale and was not achieved in this study if we are to successfully add realistic mortality and replacement of coyotes to the cemca we would expect an increased chance of local extinction of em due to the temporary disappearance of hosts leading to renewed spatial heterogeneity in prevalence it is known that heterogeneous landscape and animal movements has significant influence on the epidemiology among wildlife and causes spatial heterogeneity lane degraaf et al 2013 real and biek 2007 and yet epidemiological model with heterogeneous landscape remains rare this experiment highlights the importance of using spatially explicit abms which contrarily to most of the epidemiological models of em transmission are able to integrate the complexity of the real urban landscape although it was not included in this study another possible experiment of interest with cemca is to test the effectiveness of the use of anthelminthic baits to deworm the coyotes often used by policy makers to reduce the risks of alveolar echinococcosis a similar study was conducted by nishina and ishikawa 2008 but their study did not include the factor of space in their analysis or individuality among hosts the cemca can add spatial factors and address their integrated effects and complexity simulation experiments could be conducted to model the treatment with anthelminthic baits in one or more high prevalence area s to see if they are effective on the local areas and or on the transmission of the parasite in the whole urban landscape moreover we could test the length of the continued application of anthelminthic baits needed to be effective and time it would take for the parasite returns to the area once the application of the anthelminthic bait is ended 5 conclusions in modelling epidemiological systems spatially explicit abms hold great advantage over traditional models in that they can simulate behaviors and spatial factors that are considered important in the transmission of parasites whereas studies using agent based models for em transmissions are not new e g nishina and ishikawa 2008 only few studies modelled the transmission of parasites in a spatially explicit manner in complex heterogeneous landscapes e g lane degraaf et al 2013 and to the best of our knowledge no such study exists for parasites with complex life cycles transmitted through a predator prey system white et al 2018b in their review stated that the modelling of parasites that features complex life cycles effects of urbanization movement ecology and individual heterogeneity of hosts are rare however in many epidemiological systems those features can be the key elements in understanding the transmission processes in the cemca we tried to incorporate most of these elements despite having shortcomings in reproducing the observed patterns we believe that the cemca is promising for understanding the em epidemiology and applications in preventative management of infectious diseases particularly in

24289,the united nations is dedicated to bringing countries together to solve international problems and to shape a better future one of the greatest challenges facing society today is meeting the population s basic needs while protecting the environment hence the un sustainable development goals 17 goals to overcome current and future sustainability challenges we incorporate the 17 goals into a simplified global socio ecological model to analyze what actions are necessary to promote a desirable future we find that the current population size and resource use are not sustainable with any one goal or combination of goals in the sustainable scenarios described here the global population decreases while maintaining higher consumption levels we estimate that sustainability hinges on maintaining an equivalence between natural and agricultural land areas and the human population approximately 1ha of land per person is necessary to promote human well being and environmental sustainability furthermore we find that long term sustainability hinges on changes within the next 50 years and goals that solely target environmental degradation or consumption are too slow to drive sustainability social progress is occurring much faster than environmental progress therefore actions that target shifts in power dynamics inequality development and education in lower income countries should be prioritized to maintain ecosystem services and promote well being the goals that incorporate a combination of socio ecological policies sdgs 3 6 8 9 10 11 promote well being and sustainability keywords un sustainable development goals well being sustainability environmental sustainability human nature modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sustainability is a convoluted word one that invokes images of humans living harmoniously with nature or a system that benefits people planet and profit the most comprehensive definition of sustainability refers to practices that allow the current population to meet their basic needs without jeopardizing the needs of future generations the topic of sustainable development has become ubiquitous in the last 30 years salvia et al 2019 yet how to achieve such a goal or whether it is even possible remains a major unknown currently there is no country that meets the basic needs of its population while also using sustainable levels of resources o neill et al 2018 therefore the business as usual practices will not provide a sustainable socio ecological system and alternative strategies are needed to promote a balance between societal needs and the environment yet sustainable development is far from straightforward and management practices even though well intentioned such as restoration and conservation initiatives can hinder recovery of natural systems and even lead to declines in human population size and well being henderson and loreau 2018 kaplan hallam and bennett 2018 nonetheless the united nations un makes continuous and considerate efforts to overcome current and future sustainability challenges the 17 un sustainable development goals sdgs and 169 targets represent a major achievement in the development of sustainable practices on a global scale however there is no quantifiable strategy to achieve sustainability nor the goals although interconnected the goals provide no details on their synergies and trade offs when it comes to overall human and ecosystem well being costanza et al 2016 two recurrent themes in the literature on sdgs relate to uncertainties surrounding interactions and indicators kubiszewski et al 2022 macfeely 2019 bennich et al 2020 horvath et al 2022 van noordwijk et al 2018 reducing poverty and feeding the population are major challenges facing many african nations but it has been argued that first other issues need to be addressed such as access to clean water and improved sanitation mugagga and nabaasa 2016 the goals outlined by the un are intricately linked with synergies between energy access food production medical facilities and water treatment nerini et al 2018 climate change policies and renewable energy beg et al 2002 urban ecosystems sustainable consumption and infrastructure development maes et al 2019 trade offs often relate to socio economic and environmental sustainability as raising environmental standards can prove costly and beyond the capacity of smallholders brandi 2017 these trade offs between socio economic sustainability and environmental sustainability can have detrimental effects on the desired outcome by either hampering the well being of the human population cazalis et al 2018 or forcing individuals to relocate brockington and igoe 2006 and by causing environmental degradation to spillover into other regions ultimately undermining the environmental policy milner gulland 2012 in the 1970s the limits to growth predicted that continuous growth would reach its limit in the 21st century resulting in a collapse of non renewable resources agricultural land and the capacity to absorb pollutants meadows et al 1972 the model investigated feedbacks between population industrial production food supply pollution and non renewable resources concluding that the pursuit of growth at the expense of the environment would lead to an uncontrollable decline in population and industrial capacity however the authors suggested that economic and ecological stability could be attained by reducing consumption and redistributing wealth more than a decade later the concept of sustainability as we know it today appeared in the brundtland 1987 report highlighting the need to maintain both present and future generations ability to access resources the debate continues over sustainable growth and the role of technology and population planning with more coupled human environment models using socio ecological indicators such as inequality

that population size must be reduced through improved human rights to ensure long term well being for all life on earth suggesting that population size and social infrastructure are critical in modeling sustainability to better understand the challenges of sustainable development in our global socio ecological system we analyze the 17 un sdgs using a simplified model with two regions a lower income region and a higher income region resource inequality and potential human biases our model cannot mimic the exact targets of the un sdgs but it is able to provide key components of change that contribute to sustainable development and gives insight into why some well intentioned policies and solutions have undesirable consequences 2 methods 2 1 base model an existing model of global two region system with inequality henderson and loreau 2021 a lower income region with higher and lower income subpopulations and a higher income region with lower and higher income subpopulations

acquire such resources and the potential to enhance production yield with technology the population growth curve follows an inverted u shape with respect to resource accessibility where the growth

this is taken into account by different rates for higher and lower income consumers for example a larger higher income subpopulation results in greater conversion some sdgs aim to limit degradation of natural land and maintain ecosystem services therefore we have included conserved natural land in the model the equation for changes in conserved natural land is given by 4 d c j d t c s j n c n j there is a negative feedback that slows the rate of conversion to conserved natural land when the total area of natural and conserved natural land increases finally the model uses technology as a proxy for economic development infrastructure innovation education and processing efficiency the change in technology is given by d t j d t m i n 1 t j t j p j 0 5 m a x 1 p j 0 5 n j e s c j 2 5 m i

akin to the power cycle described by scheffer et al 2017 the initial conditions are set to reflect current population figures in lower and higher income regions using data from the world bank 2019

details regarding the model equations and functions are provided in the supplementary information 2 2 parameterization there are no clear mechanisms indicated in the un sustainable development goals sgds nor outlines as to how the goals are interconnected therefore we used the targets to modify our model parameters in an effort to best represent each goal and specific targets within the goal details in the supplementary information the model is constrained and modified to meet the targets of each goal details in table 1 the base model is parameterized to conceptually reflect differences in lower and higher income regions using data from the world bank 2019 and global footprint network 2019 while the sdg parameterization is based on the desired outcome of each goal i e reduction targets increases in development decreases in inequality the modifications made to the model in the majority of scenarios are represented by changes in rates or bounds placed on functions the mechanisms that drive actions i e resource accessibility dynamics technology curve population dynamics and model functions are not modified even without changing these mechanisms the many feedbacks within the model fig 1 and the socio ecological system it represents provide avenues for the sdgs to make changes nearly all goals modify the rate of change of technology innovation and the generation of new technology t l t h technology innovation coefficients in each region many of the sdgs specifically target lower income regions which is reflected in the parameter changes as well as an emphasis placed on technological and innovative improvements i e large increases in technology innovation coefficient in the l region the precise increase in the t l and t h coefficients is based on the percent change in development required to achieve the goal changing the technology innovation coefficient in the model leads to long term changes in power dynamics social development infrastructure development and the ability to access resources the modifications to the model in table 1 are based on ideal outcomes 2 3 implementing un sdgs in model a more detailed explanation of the parameter changes and bounds for each of the un sustainable development goals is given in the supplementary information table s1 a ideal values and b realistic values we run an ideal scenario table s1 a where each goal is executed efficiently and effectively and a realistic scenario table s1 b based on the degree of importance assigned to each goal per region and the ease of implementing the targets salvia et al 2019 for example climate change is deemed critical by all however the likelihood of individuals implementing the necessary changes to mitigate climate change remains a challenge gifford 2011 furthermore the damage to the coral reefs rising sea levels and ocean acidification cannot be undone frölicher and joos 2010 which makes climate change a difficult goal to achieve 2 4 time scale sustainability in the human context is discussed over relatively short time scales discussions of human development beyond the beginning of the 22nd century are often seen as irrelevant given how rapidly society progresses therefore the model simulations are run for 70 years we also include long term simulations to analyze the sustainability of the system for each scenario under current conditions after 700 years the results reach a sustained value given that the model contains 12 variables we are unable to calculate an analytic equilibrium hence we run the model over an extended period to give an idea of possible trends these long term results are unlikely to be quantitatively realistic nor do they infer an equilibrium but they can give an idea of which practices are sustainable under current conditions 3 results discussion the model shows the potential for positive change along the environmental social and economic axes all of which are pillars of sustainability here socio economic sustainability is quantified by population size and well being well being is measured quantitatively by access to resources which is calculated as a function of resource availability and technology development qualitatively this resource accessibility measure is a proxy for education wealth health and environmental quality henderson and loreau 2019 ocde 2020 environmental sustainability is determined by the extent of land cover change under the ideal scenario i e goals implemented efficiently and in accordance with targets the majority of sdgs promote higher well being and more sustainable land use fig 2 however there is a discrepancy between the stated goals and what individuals in each region are willing to change or what they believe needs to change salvia et al 2019 therefore we also included a more realistic scenario where we skew the goals based on the regional interest in pursuing each goal and the ease of implementing the goals in the realistic scenario fig 3 the number of goals providing positive change compared to the business as usual bau scenario decreases from 15 out of 17 in the ideal scenario to 10 out of 17 in the ideal scenario nearly all goals slow the degradation of natural land reduce population size and improve well being fig 2 in contrast the realistic scenario decreases the rate of land degradation in the lower income region only improves well being in 8 scenarios and reduces population growth in 9 out of 17 scenarios fig 3 which suggests if the goals are only partially implemented the outcome is unlikely to improve and in some scenarios may result in faster land degradation and a larger global population e g sdgs 2 12 in fig 3 in the following paragraphs we give possible reasons for the unintended consequences and potential drivers of increased population size and land degradation 3 1 well being improving well being in the next 70 years is shown here to be critical in achieving long term sustainability fig 4 as sustainability requires that the needs of the current population are met while also ensuring that the needs of the future population can be met if within the next 70 years well being improves in the p l such that well being is good 3 1 ha 5 9 ha pers then the long term outcome is a sustainable population with excess well being 5 9 ha pers otherwise regardless of the goal or target the population well being in both regions declines to poor or worse overtime with the degradation of land figs 2 4 3 5 the exception being no poverty sdg 1 which maintains a moderate well being for long enough to allow the population and land cover to balance out additionally the life on land goal sdg 15 is highly susceptible to changes in income status and dispersal which are dependent on the access to resources in the ideal scenario the recovery of the natural land prevents the collapse of resources long term and allows the population well being to improve overtime from moderate to excess resource access however in the realistic scenario the recovery of natural land is not fast enough to prevent population displacement due to insufficient resources pushing the system away from sustainability natural land recovery efforts in the absence of social consideration need to be sufficient and well received otherwise the outcome is less desirable than the business as usual scenario however if combined with social development the risk of counteractive feedbacks are reduced and sustainability is achievable 3 2 land cover consumption surprisingly the effort to decrease land degradation and promote natural land recovery as seen in sdgs 14 and 15 further increases population growth if changes to the environment are prescribed without considering inequality and other social issues the outcome of decreasing degradation restoration and conservation is undermined by insufficient development in lower income regions and the unequal distribution of goods this occurs as feedbacks within the system move people and goods between regions causing an improved sense of access to resources and increased consumption these feedbacks lead to time lags between actual change and perceived change henderson and loreau 2021 and as a result there is no change in well being i e resource accessibility per capita however if social issues and infrastructure development in the lower income region are included with environmental management the overall well being improves the environment degrades more slowly and the population becomes wealthier and grows more slowly over the next 70 years as is the case with sustainable cities and communities sdg 11 climate change sdg 13 clean water sanitation sdg 6 development goals and all the goals combined the feedbacks described above are suspended by more equal distribution of goods and resources the impact of reduced consumption sdg 12 is similar to the environmental goals sdgs 14 15 conceivable decreases in consumption 10 30 reduction are too slow to promote sustainable land use over the next 70 years we tested various rates of land degradation to determine if reduced consumption and degradation alone could increase well being while reducing the degradation rate of natural land and we found that the decline in consumption and degradation of land needed to be 10 times the current rate to avoid feedbacks in the system that counteracted land use changes the climate change goal sdg 13 has garnered the most attention and is a priority for both higher income and lower income regions which is why the implementation of climate change action has such a positive impact on the modeled system the population only increases by 0 16b globally over the next 70 years compared to 5b in the business as usual bau scenario over the same period and well being in the l region doubles figs 2 3 the decrease in the h population results in less consumption and slower land degradation in the l region 20 more natural land that being said this goal is also difficult to achieve the description of the climate change goal provides very few targets compared to the other goals but in our model we give optimistic values for parameter changes based on the bias towards promoting sdg 13 salvia et al 2019 the challenges related to the climate change goal arise from the ambiguity in how to implement actions and the resistance to perceived paradigm shifts in daily habits in order to meet climate change targets nonetheless the climate change goal combines many other sdgs that are more manageable at the regional scale such as education sdg 4 reduced consumption sdg 12 development of green technologies sdg 9 therefore if individuals gave the attention they do to climate change to these synergistic goals the outcome could be favorable for the human population the environment and the economy without being overwhelming or politically economically polarizing 3 3 population the lower income and higher income regions have drastically different lifestyles and habits henderson and loreau 2021 cumming and von cramon taubadel 2018 which is why implementing the same goal in two distinct regions may not be effective and can even have negative consequences due to differing feedbacks and behaviors within each system our model shows that the lower income region needs to develop in order to have any chance at sustainability but that will also increase the need to consume responsibly to avoid the same errors made by higher income countries this work along with others salvia et al 2019 united nations 2019 emphasizes the need for higher income countries to focus on sdgs 12 13 and 15 while promoting equality sdg 10 both locally and abroad the model suggests that the current development and technology in the h region is sufficient to promote sustainability but the resource use needs to be reduced and more evenly distributed among society for long term maintenance of resources given the differences between the two regions the future population dynamics how many where and in what income bracket will play a critical role in sustainability the higher income region experiences the greatest population increases figs 2 3 either from migration δ l p n a c t g h p n a c t or populations shifting income groups s l h p n a c t s h l p n a c t recently migration rates have outpaced the population growth rate united nations population division 2019 as individuals seek better opportunities united nations global perspective human stories 2019 the move from the l region to the h region in sdgs 2 5 12 14 15 16 can be explained by the described recent migration trends furthermore as the flow from the l region into the h region increases so does the inequality gap between the two regions which tends to increase the volume of individuals migrating lee 1966 and explains the massive population increase in the h region seen in the simulations the realistic scenario increases the number of people searching for better opportunities as inequality is greater in the realistic scenario a v g r l moderate a v g r h excess realistic scenario a v g r l good a v g r h excess ideal scenario only in the combined goals scenario where the largest parameter change for all the sdgs is selected do both regions become equal with only higher income subpopulations and no migration a v g r j r i j 1 δ i j p n a c t additionally simulations show a major increase in development in the l region and therefore in many cases growth of the higher income population results from whole countries becoming wealthier in scenarios for sdgs 1 3 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 13 17 a portion of the l region becomes wealthier and therefore the total higher income population increases without actually dispersing as a result of more higher income individuals land degradation occurs more rapidly in the h region to accommodate for more people and greater needs improved well being and wealth for the lower income population will place greater demands on the environment but that is not a reason to prevent development in lower income countries as it stands the current population numbers and resource use are not truly sustainable the future sustainable population would have to be much smaller in order to maintain a high consumption lifestyle in this scenario individuals make the choice of higher consumption lifestyles with fewer children gradually decreasing the population over the next 700 years the exact values may not be realistic however from the results we conclude that sustainability requires a proportional ratio of natural and agricultural land to human population size to promote well being and maintain ecosystem services figs 4 5 the proportion of agricultural land can exceed the proportion of natural land but given the model assumptions that agricultural land and technology development decline in the absence of natural land there is no scenario in which agricultural land exists long term without natural land therefore agricultural land would decline without natural land and ultimately lead to famine within the population 3 4 inequality there is an overwhelming theme that arises when analyzing the goals sustainability requires a change in power dynamics i e inequality in the model power determines how much access each region and subpopulation within the region has to natural and agricultural resources and how the land is managed the current system is heavily skewed against lower income countries p o w e r l p o w e r h r l r h impacting income i e s i j p n a c t land management i e x d n h p t x d n l p t x d a h p n c t x d a l p n c t and mobility i e r h l a v g r h d h l p n a c t this creates a positive feedback of inequality that leads to an undesirable future the model shows three ways in which the power ratio can be improved first a direct change in land access and management through policy intervention that promotes equal access between higher income and lower income regions such as the case of sdg 10 reduced inequalities second the access to resources may be redistributed to ensure equal distribution among income levels and individuals sdg 2 zero hunger lastly by increasing technology and development e g sdgs 3 4 9 11 power intrinsically changes as the lower income region improves living conditions and have greater capital to manage their own land 3 5 technology development the model uses a broad definition of technology and development which includes innovation infrastructure education and income gains the emphasis on technology and development shown here should be taken with a grain of salt as binswanger 2001 suggested that resource saving and energy saving technological progress will not be sufficient in order to make the economy sustainable because of the induced feedback in energy or resource demand described as the rebound effect furthermore rapid economic development without consideration for the environment and without proper infrastructure and waste management leads to severe environmental degradation tang et al 2017 therefore the type of development or the effect of technology may be more critical than the quantitative change in order for technology and development to be effective tools they need to take into consideration social and environmental needs this is where power dynamics are most evident who gets to decide what rules are set and how they are enforced how the economic incentives and disincentives are applied and what norms and expectations are placed on people and organizations swinburn 2019 4 conclusion realistically in the long run the current population size and resource use are not sustainable with any one goal or combination of goals our work shows that over the next 70 years achieving at least a good measure of well being is possible for the majority of the global human population by targeting goals that promote health education public infrastructure and greater equality whether the long term outcome is sustainable depends on goals that balance the ratio of people to nature here we describe two options for sustainability such that the population and natural land are both maintained and the demands of the current and future populations are met without diminishing environmental integrity first consumption levels and land degradation must decline to provide ecosystem services for future generations while maintaining the current population furthermore a combination of social and environmental practices are needed to avoid feedbacks that can produce unintended consequences this option seems highly unlikely as consumption is on the rise and the benefits from green technologies are ambiguous alternatively sustainability can be achieved by maintaining a balance between people and land the number of people needs to be proportional to the total combined area of natural and agricultural land we find that the long term sustainable population maintains a high consumption lifestyle i e excess well being through feedbacks that decrease fertility rates and increase longevity this reduction in population in addition to technology and development maintain natural and agricultural land resulting in a sustainable system without drastic changes to technology population size or consumption the current system is not sustainable the model does not allow us to give precise recommendations or projections for sustainability nor is the model intended to thoroughly evaluate the un sustainable development goals rather we aim to shed some light on sustainable development and highlight general weaknesses and strengths in our current practices that may hinder or help with the sustainability challenge generally speaking implementing policies to revive natural areas are too slow on their own to yield a sustainable future whereas reducing inequality is essential to making strides towards sustainability the results show that a minimum technology innovation and social development increase in lower income regions or direct changes to inequality are required to promote sustainability but the technology needs to work in tandem with environmental protection otherwise development may cause severe environmental damage and jeopardize any sustainability efforts furthermore given the short window of opportunity to improve well being in the lower income regions if actions to improve sustainability are postponed 50 years then none of the sdgs provide a sustainable future for people or the environment in this paper we identify some possible synergies but we did not exhaust all the possibilities and we assume all goals are implemented at the same time the 169 sdg targets and 232 indicators provide useful guidelines for sustainable development but as others have suggested kubiszewski et al 2022 diaz sarachaga et al 2018 achieving each target or specific indicators may be unnecessary or redundant given the overall simplicity of the model many of the targets result in the same parameter changes this simplicity allows us to see how many of the goals require increases in development social technological decreases in natural land degradation and the redistribution of resource accessibility how these changes are implemented is specific to each region and economic group which is one major advantage of the un sustainable development goals but this also requires cooperation on time and spatial scales to be effective credit authorship contribution statement kirsten

24289,the united nations is dedicated to bringing countries together to solve international problems and to shape a better future one of the greatest challenges facing society today is meeting the population s basic needs while protecting the environment hence the un sustainable development goals 17 goals to overcome current and future sustainability challenges we incorporate the 17 goals into a simplified global socio ecological model to analyze what actions are necessary to promote a desirable future we find that the current population size and resource use are not sustainable with any one goal or combination of goals in the sustainable scenarios described here the global population decreases while maintaining higher consumption levels we estimate that sustainability hinges on maintaining an equivalence between natural and agricultural land areas and the human population approximately 1ha of land per person is necessary to promote human well being and environmental sustainability furthermore we find that long term sustainability hinges on changes within the next 50 years and goals that solely target environmental degradation or consumption are too slow to drive sustainability social progress is occurring much faster than environmental progress therefore actions that target shifts in power dynamics inequality development and education in lower income countries should be prioritized to maintain ecosystem services and promote well being the goals that incorporate a combination of socio ecological policies sdgs 3 6 8 9 10 11 promote well being and sustainability keywords un sustainable development goals well being sustainability environmental sustainability human nature modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sustainability is a convoluted word one that invokes images of humans living harmoniously with nature or a system that benefits people planet and profit the most comprehensive definition of sustainability refers to practices that allow the current population to meet their basic needs without jeopardizing the needs of future generations the topic of sustainable development has become ubiquitous in the last 30 years salvia et al 2019 yet how to achieve such a goal or whether it is even possible remains a major unknown currently there is no country that meets the basic needs of its population while also using sustainable levels of resources o neill et al 2018 therefore the business as usual practices will not provide a sustainable socio ecological system and alternative strategies are needed to promote a balance between societal needs and the environment yet sustainable development is far from straightforward and management practices even though well intentioned such as restoration and conservation initiatives can hinder recovery of natural systems and even lead to declines in human population size and well being henderson and loreau 2018 kaplan hallam and bennett 2018 nonetheless the united nations un makes continuous and considerate efforts to overcome current and future sustainability challenges the 17 un sustainable development goals sdgs and 169 targets represent a major achievement in the development of sustainable practices on a global scale however there is no quantifiable strategy to achieve sustainability nor the goals although interconnected the goals provide no details on their synergies and trade offs when it comes to overall human and ecosystem well being costanza et al 2016 two recurrent themes in the literature on sdgs relate to uncertainties surrounding interactions and indicators kubiszewski et al 2022 macfeely 2019 bennich et al 2020 horvath et al 2022 van noordwijk et al 2018 reducing poverty and feeding the population are major challenges facing many african nations but it has been argued that first other issues need to be addressed such as access to clean water and improved sanitation mugagga and nabaasa 2016 the goals outlined by the un are intricately linked with synergies between energy access food production medical facilities and water treatment nerini et al 2018 climate change policies and renewable energy beg et al 2002 urban ecosystems sustainable consumption and infrastructure development maes et al 2019 trade offs often relate to socio economic and environmental sustainability as raising environmental standards can prove costly and beyond the capacity of smallholders brandi 2017 these trade offs between socio economic sustainability and environmental sustainability can have detrimental effects on the desired outcome by either hampering the well being of the human population cazalis et al 2018 or forcing individuals to relocate brockington and igoe 2006 and by causing environmental degradation to spillover into other regions ultimately undermining the environmental policy milner gulland 2012 in the 1970s the limits to growth predicted that continuous growth would reach its limit in the 21st century resulting in a collapse of non renewable resources agricultural land and the capacity to absorb pollutants meadows et al 1972 the model investigated feedbacks between population industrial production food supply pollution and non renewable resources concluding that the pursuit of growth at the expense of the environment would lead to an uncontrollable decline in population and industrial capacity however the authors suggested that economic and ecological stability could be attained by reducing consumption and redistributing wealth more than a decade later the concept of sustainability as we know it today appeared in the brundtland 1987 report highlighting the need to maintain both present and future generations ability to access resources the debate continues over sustainable growth and the role of technology and population planning with more coupled human environment models using socio ecological indicators such as inequality

models analyzing the synergies and trade offs between goals and measuring indicators or quantifying achievement of goals costanza et al 2016 spaiser et al 2017 collste et al 2017 schulze et al 2017 de la poza et al 2021 of the models mentioned only a handful explicitly model human population as a function of well being and the feedbacks with resource use a recent article by crist et al 2022 warns that population size must be reduced through improved human rights to ensure long term well being for all life on earth suggesting that population size and social infrastructure are critical in modeling sustainability to better understand the challenges of sustainable development in our global socio ecological system we analyze the 17 un sdgs using a simplified model with two regions a lower income region and a higher income region resource inequality and potential human biases our model cannot mimic the exact targets of the un sdgs but it is able to provide key components of change that contribute to sustainable development and gives insight into why some well intentioned policies and solutions have undesirable consequences 2 methods 2 1 base model an existing model of global two region system with inequality henderson and loreau 2021 a lower income region with higher and lower income subpopulations and a higher income region with lower and higher income subpopulations provides the framework for this work fig 1 in addition to four population variables p i j i income status of people j income status of region the model consists of natural land in lower and higher income regions n j agricultural land in l and h regions a j conserved natural land in each region c j and technology development in lower and higher income regions t j in the henderson and loreau 2021 model resource accessibility drives societal feedbacks within the system but resource accessibility is also determined by numerous variables making it the nucleus of the model resource accessibility per individual is dependent on the power wielded by their region a combination of technological development and population size the availability of agricultural and natural resources the ability to acquire such resources and the potential to enhance production yield with technology the population growth curve follows an inverted u shape with respect to resource accessibility where the growth rate increases as resource accessibility increases reaching a peak when resource accessibility is below a moderate level after which it decreases with greater resource accessibility and well being the change in population size in each region p i j includes social aspects such as migration emigrating δ i j p n a c t and immigrating δ i j p n a c t change in income status s i j p n a c t s i j p n a

within each subgroup is given by 1 d p i j d t g i j p n a c t s i j p n a c t δ i j p n a c t p i j s i j p n a c t p i j δ i j p n a c t p i j the model uses resource accessibility and power dynamics to determine social changes and consumption patterns resource accessibility is determined by technology and development which facilitates access to resources natural land the availability of resources and ecosystem services and agricultural land the availability of resources and provisioning services the change in natural land is given by 2 d n j d t d n j p t x d n j p t c v j p t n j a

natural land c s j n c which provides supporting and regulating services but not provisioning services natural land restoration in the model either occurs naturally through abandonment of agricultural land a d or through active restoration r t j p n a c agricultural land conversion is the primary driver of natural land degradation but it is also highly dependent on the ecosystem services natural land provide therefore agricultural land will continuously degrade without sufficient natural land the change in agricultural land is given by 3 d a j d t d a j p n c t x d a j p n c t a d a j c v j p t n j population size has both a positive and negative impact on agricultural land by increasing degradation domestic d a j p n c t and foreign x d a j p n c t and increasing conversion from natural to agricultural land c v j p t in the model technology decreases the need to convert land by increasing efficiency the benefits of technology have been debated based on the rebound effect freeman 2018 this is taken into account by different rates for higher and lower income consumers for example a larger higher income subpopulation results in greater conversion some sdgs aim to limit degradation of natural land and maintain ecosystem services therefore we have included conserved natural land in the model the equation for changes in conserved natural land is given by 4 d c j d t c s j n c n j there is a negative feedback that slows the rate of conversion to conserved natural land when the total area of natural and conserved natural land increases finally the model uses technology as a proxy for economic development infrastructure innovation education and processing efficiency the change in technology is given by d t j d t m i n 1 t j t j p j 0 5 m a x 1 p j 0 5 n j e s c j 2 5 m i

details regarding the model equations and functions are provided in the supplementary information 2 2 parameterization there are no clear mechanisms indicated in the un sustainable development goals

in lower and higher income regions using data from the world bank 2019 and global footprint network 2019 while the sdg parameterization is based on the desired outcome of each goal i e reduction targets increases in development decreases in inequality the modifications made to the model in the majority of scenarios are represented by changes in rates or bounds placed on functions the mechanisms that drive actions i e resource accessibility dynamics technology curve population dynamics and model functions are not modified even without changing these mechanisms the many feedbacks within the model fig 1 and the socio ecological system it represents provide avenues for the sdgs to make changes nearly all goals modify the rate of change of technology innovation and the generation of new technology t l t h technology innovation coefficients in each region many of the sdgs specifically target lower income regions which is reflected in the parameter changes as well as an emphasis placed on technological and innovative improvements i e large increases in technology innovation coefficient in the l region the precise increase in the t l and t h coefficients is based on the percent change in development required to achieve the goal changing the technology innovation coefficient in the model leads to long term changes in power dynamics social development infrastructure development and the ability to access resources the modifications to the model in table 1 are based on ideal outcomes 2 3 implementing un sdgs in model a more detailed explanation of the parameter changes and bounds for each of the un sustainable development goals is given in the supplementary information table s1 a ideal values and b realistic values we run an ideal scenario table s1 a where each goal is executed efficiently and effectively and a realistic scenario table s1 b based on the degree of importance assigned to each goal per region and the ease of implementing the targets salvia

furthermore the damage to the coral reefs rising sea levels and ocean acidification cannot be undone frölicher and joos 2010 which makes climate change a difficult goal to achieve 2 4 time scale sustainability in the human context is discussed over relatively short time scales discussions of human development beyond the beginning of the 22nd century are often seen as irrelevant given how rapidly society progresses therefore the model simulations are run for 70 years we also include long term simulations to analyze the sustainability of the system for each scenario under current conditions after 700 years the results reach a sustained value given that the model contains 12 variables we are unable to calculate an analytic equilibrium hence we run the model over an extended period to give an idea of possible trends these long term results are unlikely to be quantitatively realistic nor do they infer an equilibrium but they can give an idea of which practices are sustainable under current conditions 3 results discussion the model shows the potential for positive change along the environmental social and economic axes all of which are pillars of sustainability here socio economic sustainability is quantified by population size and well being well being is measured quantitatively by access to resources which is calculated as a function of resource availability and technology development qualitatively this resource accessibility measure is a proxy for education wealth health and environmental quality henderson and loreau 2019 ocde 2020 environmental sustainability is determined by the extent of land cover change under the ideal scenario i e goals implemented efficiently and in accordance with targets the majority of sdgs promote higher well being and more sustainable land use fig 2 however there is a discrepancy between the stated goals and what individuals in each region are willing to change or what they believe needs to change salvia et al 2019 therefore we also included a more realistic scenario where we skew the goals based on the regional interest in pursuing each goal and the ease of implementing the goals in the realistic scenario fig 3 the number of goals providing positive change compared to the business as usual bau scenario decreases from 15 out of 17 in the ideal scenario to 10 out of 17 in the ideal scenario nearly all goals slow the degradation of natural land reduce population size and improve well being fig 2 in contrast the realistic scenario decreases the rate of land degradation in the lower income region only improves well being in 8 scenarios and reduces population growth in 9 out of 17 scenarios fig 3 which suggests if the goals are only partially implemented the outcome is unlikely to improve and in some scenarios may result in faster land degradation and a larger global population e g sdgs 2 12 in fig 3 in the following paragraphs we give possible reasons for the unintended consequences and potential drivers of increased population size and land degradation 3 1 well being improving well being in the next 70 years is shown here to be critical in achieving long term sustainability fig 4 as sustainability requires that the needs of the current population are met while also ensuring that the needs of the future population can be met if within the next 70 years well being improves in the p l such that well being is good 3 1 ha 5 9 ha pers then the long term outcome is a sustainable population with excess well being 5 9 ha pers otherwise regardless of the goal or target the population well being in both regions declines to poor or worse overtime with the degradation of land figs 2 4 3 5 the exception being no poverty sdg 1 which maintains a moderate well being for long enough to allow the population and land cover to balance out additionally the life on land goal sdg 15 is highly susceptible to changes in income status and dispersal which are dependent on the access to resources in the ideal scenario the recovery of the natural land prevents the collapse of resources long term and allows the population well being to improve overtime from moderate to excess resource access however in the realistic scenario the recovery of natural land is not fast enough to prevent population displacement due to insufficient resources pushing the system away from sustainability natural land recovery efforts in the absence of social consideration need to be sufficient and well received otherwise the outcome is less desirable than the business as usual scenario however if combined with social development the risk of counteractive feedbacks are reduced and sustainability is achievable 3 2 land cover consumption surprisingly the effort to decrease land degradation and promote natural land recovery as seen in sdgs 14 and 15 further increases population growth if changes to the environment are prescribed without considering inequality and other social issues the outcome of decreasing degradation restoration and conservation is undermined by insufficient development in lower income regions and the unequal distribution of goods this occurs as feedbacks within the system move people and goods between regions causing an improved sense of access to resources and increased consumption these feedbacks lead to time lags between actual change and perceived change henderson and loreau 2021 and as a result there is no change in well being i e resource accessibility per capita however if social issues and infrastructure development in the lower income region are included with environmental management the overall well being improves the environment degrades more slowly and the population becomes wealthier and grows more slowly over the next 70 years as is the case with sustainable cities and communities sdg 11 climate change sdg 13 clean water sanitation sdg 6 development goals and all the goals combined the feedbacks described above are suspended by more equal distribution of goods and resources the impact of reduced consumption sdg 12 is similar to the environmental goals sdgs 14 15 conceivable decreases in consumption 10 30 reduction are too slow to promote sustainable land use over the next 70 years we tested various rates of land degradation to determine if reduced consumption and degradation alone could increase well being while reducing the degradation rate of natural land and we found that the decline in consumption and degradation of land needed to be 10 times the current rate to avoid feedbacks in the system that counteracted land use changes the climate change goal sdg 13 has garnered the most attention and is a priority for both higher income and lower income regions which is why the implementation of climate change action has such a positive impact on the modeled system the population only increases by 0 16b globally over the next 70 years compared to 5b in the business as usual bau scenario over the same period and well being in the l region doubles figs 2 3 the decrease in the h population results in less consumption and slower land degradation in the l region 20 more natural land that being said this goal is also difficult to achieve the description of the climate change goal provides very few targets compared to the other goals but in our model we give optimistic values for parameter changes based on the bias towards promoting sdg 13 salvia et al 2019 the challenges related to the climate change goal arise from the ambiguity in how to implement actions and the resistance to perceived paradigm shifts in daily habits in order to meet climate change targets nonetheless the climate change goal combines many other sdgs that are more manageable at the regional scale such as education sdg 4 reduced consumption sdg 12 development of green technologies sdg 9 therefore if individuals gave the attention they do to climate change to these synergistic goals the outcome could be favorable for the human population the environment and the economy without being overwhelming or politically economically polarizing 3 3 population the lower income and higher income regions have drastically different lifestyles and habits henderson and loreau 2021 cumming and von cramon taubadel 2018 which is why implementing the same goal in two distinct regions may not be effective and can even have negative consequences due to differing feedbacks and behaviors within each system our model shows that the lower income region needs to develop in order to have any chance at sustainability but that will also increase the need to consume responsibly to avoid the same errors made by higher income countries this work along with others salvia et al 2019 united nations 2019 emphasizes the need for higher income countries to focus on sdgs 12 13 and 15 while promoting equality sdg 10 both locally and abroad the model suggests that the current development and technology in the h region is sufficient to promote sustainability but the resource use needs to be reduced and more evenly distributed among society for long term maintenance of resources given the differences between the two regions the future population dynamics how many where and in what income bracket will play a critical role in sustainability the higher income region experiences the greatest population increases figs 2 3 either from migration δ l p n a c t g h p n a c t or populations shifting income groups s l h p n a c t s h l p n a c t recently migration rates have outpaced the population growth rate united nations population division 2019 as individuals seek better opportunities united nations global perspective human stories 2019 the move from the l region to the h region in sdgs 2 5 12 14 15 16 can be explained by the described recent migration trends furthermore as the flow from the l region into the h region increases so does the inequality gap between the two regions which tends to increase the volume of individuals migrating lee 1966 and explains the massive population increase in the h region seen in the simulations the realistic scenario increases the number of people searching for better opportunities as inequality is greater in the realistic scenario a v g r l moderate a v g r h excess realistic scenario a v g r l good a v g r h excess ideal scenario only in the combined goals scenario where the largest parameter change for all the sdgs is selected do both regions become equal with only higher income subpopulations and no migration a v g r j r i j 1 δ i j p n a c t additionally simulations show a major increase in development in the l region and therefore in many cases growth of the higher income population results from whole countries becoming wealthier in scenarios for sdgs 1 3 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 13 17 a portion of the l region becomes wealthier and therefore the total higher income population increases without actually dispersing as a result of more higher income individuals land degradation occurs more rapidly in the h region to accommodate for more people and greater needs improved well being and wealth for the lower income population will place greater demands on the environment but that is not a reason to prevent development in lower income countries as it stands the current population numbers and resource use are not truly sustainable the future sustainable population would have to be much smaller in order to maintain a high consumption lifestyle in this scenario individuals make the choice of higher consumption lifestyles with fewer children gradually decreasing the population over the next 700 years the exact values may not be realistic however from the results we conclude that sustainability requires a proportional ratio of natural and agricultural land to human population size to promote well being and maintain ecosystem services figs 4 5 the proportion of agricultural land can exceed the proportion of natural land but given the model assumptions that agricultural land and technology development decline in the absence of natural land there is no scenario in which agricultural land exists long term without natural land therefore agricultural land would decline without natural land and ultimately lead to famine within the population 3 4 inequality there is an overwhelming theme that arises when analyzing the goals sustainability requires a change in power dynamics i e inequality in the model power determines how much access each region and subpopulation within the region has to natural and agricultural resources and how the land is managed the current system is heavily skewed against lower income countries p o w e r l p o w e r h r l r h impacting income i e s i j p n a c t land management i e x d n h p t x d n l p t x d a h p n c t x d a l p n c t and mobility i e r h l a v g r h d h l p n a c t this creates a positive feedback of inequality that leads to an undesirable future the model shows three ways in which the power ratio can be improved first a direct change in land access and management through policy intervention that promotes equal access between higher income and lower income regions such as the case of sdg 10 reduced inequalities second the access to resources may be redistributed to ensure equal distribution among income levels and individuals sdg 2 zero hunger lastly by increasing technology and development e g sdgs 3 4 9 11 power intrinsically changes as the lower income region improves living conditions and have greater capital to manage their own land 3 5 technology development the model uses a broad definition of technology and development which includes innovation infrastructure education and income gains the emphasis on technology and development shown here should be taken with a grain of salt as binswanger 2001 suggested that resource saving and energy saving technological progress will not be sufficient in order to make the economy sustainable because of the induced feedback in energy or resource demand described as the rebound effect furthermore rapid economic development without consideration for the environment and without proper infrastructure and waste management leads to severe environmental degradation tang et al 2017 therefore the type of development or the effect of technology may be more critical than the quantitative change in order for technology and development to be effective tools they need to take into consideration social and environmental needs this is where power dynamics are most evident who gets to decide what rules are set and how they are enforced how the economic incentives and disincentives are applied and what norms and expectations are placed on people and organizations swinburn 2019 4 conclusion realistically in the long run the current population size and resource use are not sustainable with any one goal or combination of goals our work shows that over the next 70 years achieving at least a good measure of well being is possible for the majority of the global human population by targeting goals that promote health education public infrastructure and greater equality whether the long term outcome is sustainable depends on goals that balance the ratio of people to nature here we describe two options for sustainability such that the population and natural land are both maintained and the demands of the current and future populations are met without diminishing environmental integrity first consumption levels and land degradation must decline to provide ecosystem services for future generations while maintaining the current population furthermore a combination of social and environmental practices are needed to avoid feedbacks that can produce unintended consequences this option seems highly unlikely as consumption is on the rise and the benefits from green technologies are ambiguous alternatively sustainability can be achieved by maintaining a balance between people and land the number of people needs to be proportional to the total combined area of natural and agricultural land we find that the long term sustainable population maintains a high consumption lifestyle i e excess well being through feedbacks that decrease fertility rates and increase longevity this reduction in population in addition to technology and development maintain natural and agricultural land resulting in a sustainable system without drastic changes to technology population size or consumption the current system is not sustainable the model does not allow us to give precise recommendations or projections for sustainability nor is the model intended to thoroughly evaluate the un sustainable development goals rather we aim to shed some light on sustainable development and highlight general weaknesses and strengths in our current practices that may hinder or help with the sustainability challenge generally speaking implementing policies to revive natural areas are too slow on their own to yield a sustainable future whereas reducing inequality is essential to making strides towards sustainability the results show that a minimum technology innovation and social development increase in lower income regions or direct changes to inequality are required to promote sustainability but the technology needs to work in tandem with environmental protection otherwise development may cause severe environmental damage and jeopardize any sustainability efforts furthermore given the short window of opportunity to improve well being in the lower income regions if actions to improve sustainability are postponed 50 years then none of the sdgs provide a sustainable future for people or the environment in this paper we identify some possible synergies but we did not exhaust all the possibilities and we assume all goals are implemented at the same time the 169 sdg targets and 232 indicators provide useful guidelines for sustainable development but as others have suggested kubiszewski et al 2022 diaz sarachaga et al 2018 achieving each target or specific indicators may be unnecessary or redundant given the overall simplicity of the model many of the targets result in the same parameter changes this simplicity allows us to see how many of the goals require increases in development social technological decreases in natural land degradation and the redistribution of resource accessibility how these changes are implemented is specific to each region and economic group which is one major advantage of the un sustainable development goals but this also requires cooperation on time and spatial scales to be effective credit authorship contribution statement kirsten
