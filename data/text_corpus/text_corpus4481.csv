22405,a planing craft is a type of marine vehicle that is supported predominantly by hydrodynamic forces at high speeds it has widespread applications in recreational and military use as well as for search and rescue operations although spray rails are a mature technology there is limited experimental data illustrating their hydrodynamic effects furthermore continuous efforts are being made to improve the efficiency safety and performance of planning craft in this paper the efficiency of the spray resistance reduction technologies spray rails and spray deflectors are compared in model scale through towing tank testing in calm water and irregular waves this study examines the influences of the technologies on the total resistance and running position of the hull in calm water and on

defensive purposes for search and rescue and for recreation among other things these vessels allow for speedy operation in archipelagos and coastal waters where islands and other obstacles are plentiful and the water is shallow with the recent increases in the power to weight ratio of outboard engines and the use of composite materials for hull structures the use of hsc has become even more widespread de marco et al 2017 with a larger and broader user base comes an increased need for technical improvements aimed specifically at hsc the last 30 years have seen an increase in research focusing on hsc but many flow phenomena are still not fully understood and relatively few publications exist that address this issue the hull of an hsc acts as a lifting surface to lift the craft out of its displacement mode this causes a significant reduction in the wetted surface area and thus the resistance this reduction allows the craft to reach high speeds without a linear increase in power consumption unlike a displacement hull as the speed increases the hull moves from displacement mode through transition mode to reach planing mode the resistance of an hsc can be decomposed into induced drag appendage resistance frictional resistance aerodynamic resistance and spray resistance larsson and hoyte 2010 payne 1982 concluded that wave making resistance tends to zero in the planing speed region while spray resistance becomes significant savitsky et al 2007 show that spray resistance can constitute over 15 of the total resistance at planing speeds the flow dynamics around hsc can be predicted using theoretical or experimental modeling theoretical modeling can be grouped into numerical methods such as potential flow based methods viscous flow based methods and semi empirical techniques yousefi et al 2013 the method by savitsky 1964 is the most widely used semi empirical method for evaluation of hsc and has over the past decades been improved through further model testing at the davidson laboratory savitsky and brown 1976 savitsky et al 2007 however the flow around hsc is difficult to simulate especially when taking dynamic instabilities into consideration therefore the main method of evaluating the performance of hsc is often towing tank testing yousefi et al 2013 because of the high importance of the spray resistance as mentioned earlier specialized methods and designs exist for predicting and reducing spray such designs include spray rails and spray deflectors which both serve to reduce the spray area accurately evaluating the efficiency of such designs is therefore of high importance for future improvements to hsc design a method of predicting the spray area its contribution to total drag and design guidelines for locating spray rails was published by savitsky et al 2007 and begovic and bertorello 2012 some of the key definitions and areas used by savitsky 1964 are shown in fig 1 the spray area located between the stagnation line and the spray edge is formed by flow reflected forward from the stagnation line since the spray is in contact with the hull frictional resistance is present in the spray area therefore the spray causes an effective increase in the wetted surface area the resistance can be lowered by forcing detachment of the flow and thus reducing the wetted surface clement 1964 showed that total resistance of an hsc can be reduced by detaching the flow in the spray area showing a reduction of the total resistance of up to 18 using spray rails the same principle has shown to be true for stepped hulls where the step detaches the flow and thus reduces the spray area and the associated resistance savitsky and morabito 2010 faltinsen 2006 there is a limited amount of experimental evaluation of spray rails early investigations include clement 1964 with recent experimental investigations of spray rails having been conducted in south korea lee et al 2010 seo et al 2016 spray deflectors are a novel method of redirecting the spray and thus reducing the spray area the spray deflectors are essentially a step located in the spray area that reflects the oncoming spray sheet aftward and downward equally there are few experimental studies on the effect of stepped hulls on the performance of hsc in fact there is only one series of systematic evaluations of stepped hulls by taunton et al 2010 they studied the influence of transverse steps on the performance characteristics of hsc and showed a significant reduction in resistance for both single and double steps cucinotta et al 2017 also showed that a transverse step reduced the drag resistance however this was only evident at higher froude numbers a unique insight to the flow phenomena at the step was gained by de marco et al 2017 who conducted experiments on a stepped hull with a transparent bottom unlike the transverse steps used by de marco et al 2017 and taunton et al 2010 the deflectors run at an angle to the center line are straight and have no curvature in contrast to the steps used by sverchkov 2010 the spray deflectors were shown to reduce the total resistance by about 30 using a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans based model with a volume of fluid vof method olin et al 2016 however no comparison with experimental results was done since experiments focusing on the effects of spray are scarce wielgosz et al 2018 tried to validate the results experimentally however their results were inconclusive due to lack of repeatability mainly due to the small wetted surface and the model being fixed in heave and pitch numerical modeling of hsc is notoriously difficult and lotfi et al 2015 achieved a 5 31 error in the trim angle compared to taunton et al 2010 for a model that was free to heave and pitch the objective of this study is to improve the knowledge regarding the effects of spray deflection technologies on the resistance and accelerations of hsc this is done by determining the reduction of the spray resistance due to the redirection of the flow and by evaluating the efficiency of spray rails and deflectors on a hull specifically designed to generate high spray forces furthermore the accelerations of the hull in waves are measured for three hull configurations bare hull spray rails and deflectors designs the results from the experimental investigation that took place in the davidson laboratory towing tank are compared to semi empirical estimations by savitsky et al 2007 2 experimental setup 2 1 spray deflection technologies the focus of the present study is to compare performance of two existing spray deflection technologies spray rails and spray deflectors the working principles of the technologies are shown in fig 2 for bare hull configuration bh top of fig 2 100 of the spray area is present so bh serves as a baseline for the comparison of spray rails and deflectors the spray rails configuration sr is shown in the middle of fig 2 similar to the experiment set up by clement 1964 the spray rails in this study are short and located in the expected spray area the rails are longitudinal stripes running parallel to the keel line and have a sharp edge that facilitates flow separation from the hull surface the design guidelines by savitsky et al 2007 were used for the geometry and placement of the spray rails to this date the spray rails technology has been widely used in the industry but its efficiency could be improved by harvesting kinetic energy from the otherwise wasted transversal flow component of the spray the deflectors configuration is shown at the bottom of fig 2 unlike spray rails the deflectors cannot be retrofitted the spray deflector is a step designed for a specific speed range it is most effective when placed in the spray area close and parallel to the expected stagnation line the spray deflectors work by reflecting the oncoming spray sheet aftward and downward therefore when located close to the stagnation line deflectors may remove an even larger portion of the spray area compared to spray rails in addition deflectors generate both lift and thrust from the kinetic energy contained in the spray 2 2 model parameters a modular hull design was selected in order to accommodate all configurations in a single model this allows for all of the equipment to be attached to the main model limiting re calibration of sensors when configurations are changed additionally the modular design helps to achieve the same model scale geometrical and mass properties for all configurations the hull dimensions are shown in table 1 the main particulars of the hull are based on variant 3 of the united states coast guard s 47 ft motor lifeboat soletic 2010 the main body is prismatic without chine flats in order for the wetted part of the hull to resemble savitsky 1964 savitsky et al 2007 semi empirical model the bow shape is curved to ensure fair hydrodynamic characteristics in waves and at pre planing speeds where the bow is in contact with water due to the selected prismatic hull form the results of this study are presumably partially valid for warped hull forms which are a common design choice 2 3 design and material the model was milled out of marine grade closed cell foam the exterior of the hull was coated with several layers of epoxy and spray paint to improve structural integrity and reduce surface roughness a 12 7 mm deep pocket was milled out of the bottom of the prismatic hull section to house pvc plate inserts the inserts were used to change between the bare hull and the deflectors hull configurations for the bh the insert was a flat plate occupying the entire pocket volume conversion from bh to sr configuration was done by attaching three equally spaced short spray rails to the bare hull on both sides of the hull the inserts for the spray deflectors sd1 and sd2 occupy the pocket area forward of the expected stagnation lines since the selected speed range is broad and spray deflectors are designed only for a specific design speed two deflectors configurations sd1 and sd2 were built with design speeds f n 4 3 and 5 87 respectively while only one sr configuration was needed as the sr were manufactured long enough for all speeds and stagnation lines the spray area and stagnation line were predicted using savitsky et al 2007 side renderings of the hull configurations are shown in fig 3 with the bottom view of the three hull configurations shown in fig 4 2 4 instrumentation and measurements the experiments were performed in the davidson laboratory high speed towing tank the tank is 95 m long 5 m wide and has variable depth of around 1 9 m the towing carriage can achieve a constant test speed of about 18 m s during the calm water tests the heave at lcg trim and total resistance of the model were measured for the irregular waves tests the number of pitch and heave encounters was recorded in accordance with ittc recommendations ittc 2017b and the vertical accelerations at the bow and lcg were measured the instrumentation and sensor details and exact locations are shown in appendix a 2 5 calm water tests the purpose of calm water tests was to determine the effects of spray deflection technologies on the total resistance therefore the displacement and running position of the different hull configurations should ideally match at the same towing speeds thus drag generated in the pressure and dry area should be the same for all configurations tested at the same speed the difference in total resistance is a direct result of differences in the spray area drag between the hull configurations for each test the total resistance dynamic trim and heave at the lcg position were measured to ensure repeatability of the results each test speed was repeated at least two times for each hull configuration each run was filmed from the aft and starboard with overwater and underwater pictures taken during the steady planing state a total of 5 speeds were selected for comparison of the three hull types the bh and sr configurations were tested at speeds boxed in magenta in fig 5 sd1 and sd2 were compared to bh and sr configurations at their design speeds and at two adjacent speeds the configurations sd1 and sd2 were also towed at interim speed intervals f n 3 91 4 70 5 48 6 26 to check for any irregularities in the running position and measured drag associated with the stagnation line crossing the deflectors finally the bh configuration was validated using the semi empirical method presented by savitsky et al 2007 therefore lower speeds shown separately on the left of fig 5 were tested for the bh configuration to allow for comparison with the predicted performance 2 6 irregular wave tests the irregular wave tests were designed to assess the influence of spray deflection technologies on the magnitude of impact accelerations the hull configurations were loaded to the same displacement and lcg position during the tests accelerations at the bow and near the lcg were measured see a for exact locations the bh sr and sd1 configurations were tested in waves at f n 1 47 and 4 30 the lower speed corresponds to speed to length ratio slr 2 and is suited for large motion amplitudes the higher speed is the design speed for the sd1 deflectors and results in high impact accelerations savitsky and brown 1976 sd2 was not tested in waves as its design speed is not suitable for operation in waves for the wave spectrum sea conditions associated with a beaufort scale force of 2 were selected because they are frequently encountered operating conditions for offshore planing vessels the hull configurations were towed in head seas generated using a 2 parameter pierson moskowitz p m spectrum the spectrum had a significant wave height h s of 96 mm and a period t p of 1 557 s in accordance with ittc recommendations ittc 2017b the models were towed at the same speed until an average of 100 heave and pitch encounters was reached the average highest third a 1 3 and highest tenth a 1 10 accelerations were calculated from the top 1 3rd and 1 10th measured accelerations 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of calm water tests in this section the towing speeds total resistance and heave are shown in non dimensional units f n r t δ and h 1 3 respectively the colors in the figures are consistent for each configuration where blue stands for bh red for sr green for sd1 and purple for sd2 the calm water tests show a significant reduction in total resistance for both spray rails and deflectors technologies as shown in fig 6 fig 7 shows comparison of sr sd1 and sd2 against bh configuration the bars represent percentage decrease in total resistance for each configuration when compared to bh drag the deflectors have shown consistent drop in total resistance with increasing speed sd1 and sd2 reduced drag by 14 5 and 20 respectively at design speeds at overlap speed f n 5 09 the sd2 removed about 2 more drag than sd1 this slight variation in resistance may have been caused by differences in deflectors location or by small variations in dynamic trim angle at higher speeds the total resistance of sr has decreased by up to 9 the spray rails were submerged at f n 3 52 causing a slight increase in resistance all results are summarized in table 2 fig 8 shows running position and spray pattern for bh sr and sd1 configurations at f n 4 3 the arrows in fig 8 show the differences in the spray patterns for bh there is a thin sheet of spray separating from the chine forward of the lcg heave post for the sr configuration the spray separates approximately at the lcg and additional spray sheets are created at the spray rails finally for sd1 the spray separates aft of the lcg the spray area is dry and the main spray is more turbulent than in the other two cases despite encouraging results the reduction in the total resistance for the deflectors configurations cannot be attributed to the deflectors interacting with the spray area alone as seen in figs 9 and 10 the running trim of sd1 and sd2 configurations was higher than the trim of the bh and sr by 0 8 1 2 an attempt to adjust the lcg of bh to match the trims of sd1 and sd2 resulted in porpoising the higher trim means the pressure and dry area are not consistent across all hull configurations and a direct comparison is not feasible therefore sd1 and sd2 have reduced the total resistance of the hull by both deflecting the oncoming spray and by causing the hull to attain a more favorable trim angle for the sr configuration on the other hand the difference in trim is negligible so the total resistance can be directly compared to the bh configuration the major source of trim discrepancies is the location of the spray deflectors which were designed for the stagnation line predicted using savitsky method savitsky et al 2007 from judge et al 2017 we know that small changes in the hull shape can have a large difference in the trim of a model as discussed in the next section the semi empirical method is insufficient to accurately predict bh s running position the bh and sr were tested first and achieved almost the same running position with the exception of heave shown in fig 11 which left no room for adjustments to deflectors design when significant offset in trim was observed in contrast to dynamic trim which was changing at the same rate for the three configurations fig 9 the heave of sd1 shown in fig 11 is almost the same as heave of sr for lower f n but it deviates and approaches bh at f n 5 09 3 2 calm water experiments in comparison to semi empirical model the bh experimental results were compared with savitsky method savitsky et al 2007 the theoretical total resistance estimated using model parameters from table 1 is plotted as a black continuous line and the experimental results are plotted as blue markers in fig 12 it is seen that at f n 4 3 the theoretical drag starts to significantly deviate from the experimental results the savitsky method savitsky et al 2007 uses semi empirical relationships to first determine the dynamic trim and wetted area of the hull and then calculates the total resistance as a sum of spray wetted and dry area resistance additional total resistance calculations were made using the savitsky method savitsky et al 2007 but this time parameters from table 1 were supplemented with experimentally measured trim and wetted area the results are plotted as orange markers in fig 12 the underprediction error of theoretical black curve and semi theoretical orange markers methods is plotted in fig 13 in corresponding colors here the experimental results are taken as a baseline or 100 the calculated resistance is a share of the 100 x 100 and the plotted error is a relative difference between the baseline and the calculated resistance 100 x as seen in fig 13 the theoretical method agrees well with the experimental results for a typical range of hsc speeds between 1 47 f n 3 52 where the relative error is 3 5 at f n 1 47 the hull is in the semi planing regime resulting in a violation of the semi empirical model the underprediction in the semi planing regime has been noted by other researchers blount and fox 1976 thus an error of higher magnitude was anticipated however at f n 4 30 the theoretical error increases beyond 10 at these speeds the dynamic trim starts to approach and exceeds 2 which is the limit of the semi empirical model therefore the semi theoretical calculations significantly improve the agreement with experimental values at higher speeds the prediction error at f n 4 30 is comparable in magnitude to drag reduction achieved by sr and sd1 at the same speed this implies that at higher speeds application of the semi empirical model for reverse calculation of resistance components from the measured total resistance yields inaccurate results and can only be used for indicative purposes 3 3 irregular wave test results for irregular waves tests the vertical accelerations of the bh sr and sd1 configurations is shown in figs 14 17 and tables 3 and 4 accelerations at the bow are fairly constant for all configurations see figs 14 and 16 except for the extreme value at the higher tested speed where both sr and sd1 experience higher acceleration than the bh see fig 16 accelerations at the lcg were greater than bh for both the sr and sd1 configurations as shown in figs 15 and 17 the highest third is most representative of the experienced accelerations while the highest extreme represents the worst case scenario the extreme value is more sensitive to the number of encounters a larger number of encounters may mean a higher change of a larger extreme value while the average should be less affected by the number of encounters statistically the probability of exceeding a 1 3 and a 1 10 is 12 and 4 respectively savitsky and brown 1976 this means that significant differences in a 1 3 and a 1 10 accelerations experienced by each hull configuration are most likely due to differences in the hull bottom geometry as both sr and sd1 are designed to increase lift compared to bh as noted from the calm water run heave results see fig 11 on the other hand the formula developed for impact accelerations in waves by savitsky and brown 1976 included the calm water trim τ 4 this means that the difference in trim observed between the sd1 configuration and the other configurations during the calm water tests could also account for the difference in accelerations during the wave tests 4 conclusions in this paper the performance of spray deflection technologies spray rails and spray deflectors was compared through towing tank testing in calm water and irregular waves the results presented in this paper are most accurate for the selected hull form and proportions but may be partially valid for varying proportions of prismatic and warped hull forms the calm water tests have shown a significant reduction in drag for both technologies spray rails resulted in drag reductions of up to 9 and only affected the heave of the model the deflectors configurations yielded even higher reductions in drag ranging from 10 to 25 but the dynamic trim of the hull differed significantly from the other two configurations for the tested deflectors configurations the significant reduction in total resistance is viewed as a combined effect of deflectors redirecting the spray sheet and causing a change in dynamic trim of the hull this provides insight into how deflectors affect overall performance but individual effects cannot be accurately isolated unless the same running trim angle is achieved for all configurations the present study shows that the semi empirical model savitsky et al 2007 is insufficient for accurate prediction of running position even for prismatic hulls additional cfd analysis or directly measured experimental data should be used for the design of the spray deflectors the wave tests have shown that the current deflectors design does not significantly affect the vertical accelerations compared to spray rails at the bow at the lcg sd1 has a significantly higher acceleration compared to sr especially the highest extreme value in general for the deflectors the data shows lowered average accelerations at the bow increased average acceleration at the lcg and increased extreme accelerations across all conditions 5 further work additional experiments are required with improved deflectors placement and geometry for more direct comparison of spray rails and deflectors configurations in waves the spray deflectors geometry could be improved if their thickness would taper from a maximum at the chine to almost zero at the keel line correctly located and tapered deflectors may eliminate the problem of the stagnation line crossing the deflectors near the chine and being too far from the deflectors at the keel since the thickness of the tapered deflectors is practically zero at the keel it will also eliminate problems associated with the tip of the deflectors re entering the water finally more insight is required to understand the spray phenomenon the current spray force prediction method is based on limited semi empirical data presented in 17 a method for direct measurement of the spray drag for a range of speeds running positions and model sizes would be invaluable for further development of the spray deflection technologies acknowledgments this research would not have been possible without the support of the faculty staff and students of davidson laboratory at stevens institute of technology especially professor raju datla and uihoon chung who have been most helpful further we would like to thank jonas danielsson at petestep ab sweden for many helpful discussions regarding stepped hulls appendixa sensors and measurements for calm water the interesting measurements are drag pitch and heave for wave runs the focus is on accelerations at the cg accelerations at the bow number of wave encounters and number of wave peaks and troughs data was collected over 120 ft for each run an unload spring was used at the cg to help control model weight the spring does affect the dynamic pitching motions in waves but does not affect calm water runs drag and pitch to measure the drag a linear variable differential transformer equipped drag balance is used rated for 222 4 n 50 lbf meaning that it can measure forces up to 222 n with an absolute error of 0 06 n the drag balance is then mounted on a pitch pivot box which measures the pitch angle through a rotational potentiometer this measurement is used for the wave runs to accurately measure the number of waves the hull encounters and is calibrated statically to within 0 0161 deg the drag balance is number 4 in table a 1 and fig a 1 while the pitch pivot box is number 3 the pitch pivot box with the drag balance is mounted to the heave post and to the hull and thus becomes the place where the thrust from the monorail carriage is transferred to the hull heave the heave is measured from a potentiometer mounted by the heave post calibrated to within 0 2 mm the heave post and sensor is number 6 in table a 1 and in fig a 1 accelerometers for the waves a set of accelerometers are used to measure the acceleration at certain points along the hull the sensors are 30g schaevitz closed loop torque balance transducers which can be mounted anywhere on the hull in this application one is put as close to the lcg position as possible and another is mounted a distance forwards closer to the bow as shown in fig a 1 the accelerometers are calibrated statically to within 0 03g the accelerometers are numbers 7 and 8 in table a 1 and in fig a 1 inclinometer to measure the static and running trim a gravity referenced inclinometer is used made by schaevitz it is their lso series which is a fully self contained fluid damped flexure suspension servo inclinometer calibrated to within 0 0005 deg the inclinometer is number 2 in table a 1 and fig a 1 sensor positions the appendages such as sensors and plates and their positions are listed in table a 1 and shown in fig a 1 in table a 1 xcg is the distance measured from the stern to the center point of each appendage and ycg is measured from the keel appendixb error and repeatability the measurements shown are the averages of the measurements for the repeated experiments the inherent uncertainty from sensors and fluctuations in the environment can be combined to predict the total uncertainty of the measurements in this paper the ittc s guidelines for calculating the uncertainty of measured data points was used ittc 2017a the total combined uncertainty u c for each speed and hull in percent is shown in table b 1

area close and parallel to the expected stagnation line the spray deflectors work by reflecting the oncoming spray sheet aftward and downward therefore when located close to the stagnation line deflectors may remove an even larger portion of the spray area compared to spray rails in addition deflectors generate both lift and thrust from the kinetic energy contained in the spray 2 2 model parameters a modular hull design was selected in order to accommodate all configurations in a single model this allows for all of the equipment to be attached to the main model limiting re calibration of sensors when configurations are changed additionally the modular design helps to achieve the same model scale geometrical and mass properties for all configurations the hull dimensions are shown in table 1 the main particulars of the hull are based on variant 3 of the united states coast guard s 47 ft motor lifeboat soletic 2010 the main body is prismatic without chine flats in order for the wetted part of the hull to resemble savitsky 1964 savitsky et al 2007 semi empirical model the bow shape is curved to ensure fair hydrodynamic characteristics in waves and at pre planing speeds where the bow is in contact with water due to the selected prismatic hull form the results of this study are presumably partially valid for warped hull forms which are a common design choice 2 3 design and material the model was milled out of marine grade closed cell foam the exterior of the hull was coated with several layers of epoxy and spray paint to improve structural integrity and reduce surface roughness a 12 7 mm deep pocket was milled out of the bottom of the prismatic hull section to house pvc plate inserts the inserts were used to change between the bare hull and the deflectors hull configurations for the bh the insert was a flat plate occupying the entire pocket volume conversion from bh to sr configuration was done by attaching three equally spaced short spray rails to the bare hull on both sides of the hull the inserts for the spray deflectors sd1 and sd2 occupy the pocket area forward of the expected stagnation lines since the selected speed range is broad and spray deflectors are designed only for a specific design speed two deflectors configurations sd1 and sd2 were built with design speeds f n 4 3 and 5 87 respectively while only one sr configuration was needed as the sr were manufactured long enough for all speeds and stagnation lines the spray area and stagnation line were predicted using savitsky et al 2007 side renderings of the hull configurations are shown in fig 3 with the bottom view of the three hull configurations shown in fig 4 2 4 instrumentation and measurements the experiments were performed in the davidson laboratory high speed towing tank the tank is 95 m long 5 m wide and has variable depth of around 1 9 m the towing carriage can achieve a constant test speed of about 18 m s during the calm water tests the heave at lcg trim and total resistance of the model were measured for the irregular waves tests the number of pitch and heave encounters was recorded in accordance with ittc recommendations ittc 2017b and the vertical accelerations at the bow and lcg were measured the instrumentation and sensor details and exact locations are shown in appendix a 2 5 calm water tests the purpose of calm water tests was to determine the effects of spray deflection technologies on the total resistance therefore the displacement and running position of the different hull configurations should ideally match at the same towing speeds thus drag generated in the pressure and dry area should be the same for all configurations tested at the same speed the difference in total resistance is a direct result of differences in the spray area drag between the hull configurations for each test the total resistance dynamic trim and heave at the lcg position were measured to ensure repeatability of the results each test speed was repeated at least two times for each hull configuration each run was filmed from the aft and starboard with overwater and underwater pictures taken during the steady planing state a total of 5 speeds were selected for comparison of the three hull types the bh and sr configurations were tested at speeds boxed in magenta in fig 5 sd1 and sd2 were compared to bh and sr configurations at their design speeds and at two adjacent speeds the configurations sd1 and sd2 were also towed at interim speed intervals f n 3 91 4 70 5 48 6 26 to check for any irregularities in the running position and measured drag associated with the stagnation line crossing the deflectors finally the bh configuration was validated using the semi empirical method presented by savitsky et al 2007 therefore lower speeds shown separately on the left of fig 5 were tested for the bh configuration to allow for comparison with the predicted performance 2 6 irregular wave tests the irregular wave tests were designed to assess the influence of spray deflection technologies on the magnitude of impact accelerations the hull configurations were loaded to the same displacement and lcg position during the tests accelerations at the bow and near the lcg were measured see a for exact locations the bh sr and sd1 configurations were tested in waves at f n 1 47 and 4 30 the lower speed corresponds to speed to length ratio slr 2 and is suited for large motion amplitudes the higher speed is the design speed for the sd1 deflectors and results in high impact accelerations savitsky and brown 1976 sd2 was not tested in waves as its design speed is not suitable for operation in waves for the wave spectrum sea conditions associated with a beaufort scale force of 2 were selected because they are frequently encountered operating conditions for offshore planing vessels the hull configurations were towed in head seas generated using a 2 parameter pierson moskowitz p m spectrum the spectrum had a significant wave height h s of 96 mm and a period t p of 1 557 s in accordance with ittc recommendations ittc 2017b the models were towed at the same speed until an average of 100 heave and pitch encounters was reached the average highest third a 1 3 and highest tenth a 1 10 accelerations were calculated from the top 1 3rd and 1 10th measured accelerations 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of calm water tests in this section the towing speeds total resistance and heave are shown in non dimensional units f n r t δ and h 1 3 respectively the colors in the figures are consistent for each configuration where blue stands for bh red for sr green for sd1 and purple for sd2 the calm water tests show a significant reduction in total resistance for both spray rails and deflectors technologies as shown in fig 6 fig 7 shows comparison of sr sd1 and sd2 against bh configuration the bars represent percentage decrease in total resistance for each configuration when compared to bh drag the deflectors have shown consistent drop in total resistance with increasing speed sd1 and sd2 reduced drag by 14 5 and 20 respectively at design speeds at overlap speed f n 5 09 the sd2 removed about 2 more drag than sd1 this slight variation in resistance may have been caused by differences in deflectors location or by small variations in dynamic trim angle at higher speeds the total resistance of sr has decreased by up to 9 the spray rails were submerged at f n 3 52 causing a slight increase in resistance all results are summarized in table 2 fig 8 shows running position and spray pattern for bh sr and sd1 configurations at f n 4 3 the arrows in fig 8 show the differences in the spray patterns for bh there is a thin sheet of spray separating from the chine forward of the lcg heave post for the sr configuration the spray separates approximately at the lcg and additional spray sheets are created at the spray rails finally for sd1 the spray separates aft of the lcg the spray area is dry and the main spray is more turbulent than in the other two cases despite encouraging results the reduction in the total resistance for the deflectors configurations cannot be attributed to the deflectors interacting with the spray area alone as seen in figs 9 and 10 the running trim of sd1 and sd2 configurations was higher than the trim of the bh and sr by 0 8 1 2 an attempt to adjust the lcg of bh to match the trims of sd1 and sd2 resulted in porpoising the higher trim means the pressure and dry area are not consistent across all hull configurations and a direct comparison is not feasible therefore sd1 and sd2 have reduced the total resistance of the hull by both deflecting the oncoming spray and by causing the hull to attain a more favorable trim angle for the sr configuration on the other hand the difference in trim is negligible so the total resistance can be directly compared to the bh configuration the major source of trim discrepancies is the location of the spray deflectors which were designed for the stagnation line predicted using savitsky method savitsky et al 2007 from judge et al 2017 we know that small changes in the hull shape can have a large difference in the trim of a model as discussed in the next section the semi empirical method is insufficient to accurately predict bh s running position the bh and sr were tested first and achieved almost the same running position with the exception of heave shown in fig 11 which left no room for adjustments to deflectors design when significant offset in trim was observed in contrast to dynamic trim which was changing at the same rate for the three configurations fig 9 the heave of sd1 shown in fig 11 is almost the same as heave of sr for lower f n but it deviates and approaches bh at f n 5 09 3 2 calm water experiments in comparison to semi empirical model the bh experimental results were compared with savitsky method savitsky et al 2007 the theoretical total resistance estimated using model parameters from table 1 is plotted as a black continuous line and the experimental results are plotted as blue markers in fig 12 it is seen that at f n 4 3 the theoretical drag starts to significantly deviate from the experimental results the savitsky method savitsky et al 2007 uses semi empirical relationships to first determine the dynamic trim and wetted area of the hull and then calculates the total resistance as a sum of spray wetted and dry area resistance additional total resistance calculations were made using the savitsky method savitsky et al 2007 but this time parameters from table 1 were supplemented with experimentally measured trim and wetted area the results are plotted as orange markers in fig 12 the underprediction error of theoretical black curve and semi theoretical orange markers methods is plotted in fig 13 in corresponding colors here the experimental results are taken as a baseline or 100 the calculated resistance is a share of the 100 x 100 and the plotted error is a relative difference between the baseline and the calculated resistance 100 x as seen in fig 13 the theoretical method agrees well with the experimental results for a typical range of hsc speeds between 1 47 f n 3 52 where the relative error is 3 5 at f n 1 47 the hull is in the semi planing regime resulting in a violation of the semi empirical model the underprediction in the semi planing regime has been noted by other researchers blount and fox 1976 thus an error of higher magnitude was anticipated however at f n 4 30 the theoretical error increases beyond 10 at these speeds the dynamic trim starts to approach and exceeds 2 which is the limit of the semi empirical model therefore the semi theoretical calculations significantly improve the agreement with experimental values at higher speeds the prediction error at f n 4 30 is comparable in magnitude to drag reduction achieved by sr and sd1 at the same speed this implies that at higher speeds application of the semi empirical model for reverse calculation of resistance components from the measured total resistance yields inaccurate results and can only be used for indicative purposes 3 3 irregular wave test results for irregular waves tests the vertical accelerations of the bh sr and sd1 configurations is shown in figs 14 17 and tables 3 and 4 accelerations at the bow are fairly constant for all configurations see figs 14 and 16 except for the extreme value at the higher tested speed where both sr and sd1 experience higher acceleration than the bh see fig 16 accelerations at the lcg were greater than bh for both the sr and sd1 configurations as shown in figs 15 and 17 the highest third is most representative of the experienced accelerations while the highest extreme represents the worst case scenario the extreme value is more sensitive to the number of encounters a larger number of encounters may mean a higher change of a larger extreme value while the average should be less affected by the number of encounters statistically the probability of exceeding a 1 3 and a 1 10 is 12 and 4 respectively savitsky and brown 1976 this means that significant differences in a 1 3 and a 1 10 accelerations experienced by each hull configuration are most likely due to differences in the hull bottom geometry as both sr and sd1 are designed to increase lift compared to bh as noted from the calm water run heave results see fig 11 on the other hand the formula developed for impact accelerations in waves by savitsky and brown 1976 included the calm water trim τ 4 this means that the difference in trim observed between the sd1 configuration and the other configurations during the calm water tests could also account for the difference in accelerations during the wave tests 4 conclusions in this paper the performance of spray deflection technologies spray rails and spray deflectors was compared through towing tank testing in calm water and irregular waves the results presented in this paper are most accurate for the selected hull form and proportions but may be partially valid for varying proportions of prismatic and warped hull forms the calm water tests have shown a significant reduction in drag for both technologies spray rails resulted in drag reductions of up to 9 and only affected the heave of the model the deflectors configurations yielded even higher reductions in drag ranging from 10 to 25 but the dynamic trim of the hull differed significantly from the other two configurations for the tested deflectors configurations the significant reduction in total resistance is viewed as a combined effect of deflectors redirecting the spray sheet and causing a change in dynamic trim of the hull this provides insight into how deflectors affect overall performance but individual effects cannot be accurately isolated unless the same running trim angle is achieved for all configurations the present study shows that the semi empirical model savitsky et al 2007 is insufficient for accurate prediction of running position even for prismatic hulls additional cfd analysis or directly measured experimental data should be used for the design of the spray deflectors the wave tests have shown that the current deflectors design does not significantly affect the vertical accelerations compared to spray rails at the bow at the lcg sd1 has a significantly higher acceleration compared to sr especially the highest extreme value in general for the deflectors the data shows lowered average accelerations at the bow increased average acceleration at the lcg and increased extreme accelerations across all conditions 5 further work additional experiments are required with improved deflectors placement and geometry for more direct comparison of spray rails and deflectors configurations in waves the spray deflectors geometry could be improved if their thickness would taper from a maximum at the chine to almost zero at the keel line correctly located and tapered deflectors may eliminate the problem of the stagnation line crossing the deflectors near the chine and being too far from the deflectors at the keel since the thickness of the tapered deflectors is practically zero at the keel it will also eliminate problems associated with the tip of the deflectors re entering the water finally more insight is required to understand the spray phenomenon the current spray force prediction method is based on limited semi empirical data presented in 17 a method for direct measurement of the spray drag for a range of speeds running positions and model sizes would be invaluable for further development of the spray deflection technologies acknowledgments this research would not have been possible without the support of the faculty staff and students of davidson laboratory at stevens institute of technology especially professor raju datla and uihoon chung who have been most helpful further we would like to thank jonas danielsson at petestep ab sweden for many helpful discussions regarding stepped hulls appendixa sensors and measurements for calm water the interesting measurements are drag pitch and heave for wave runs the focus is on accelerations at the cg accelerations at the bow number of wave encounters and number of wave peaks and troughs data was collected over 120 ft for each run an unload spring was used at the cg to help control model weight the spring does affect the dynamic pitching motions in waves but does not affect calm water runs drag and pitch to measure the drag a linear variable differential transformer equipped drag balance is used rated for 222 4 n 50 lbf meaning that it can measure forces up to 222 n with an absolute error of 0 06 n the drag balance is then mounted on a pitch pivot box which measures the pitch angle through a rotational potentiometer this measurement is used for the wave runs to accurately measure the number of waves the hull encounters and is calibrated statically to within 0 0161 deg the drag balance is number 4 in table a 1 and fig a 1 while the pitch pivot box is number 3 the pitch pivot box with the drag balance is mounted to the heave post and to the hull and thus becomes the place where the thrust from the monorail carriage is transferred to the hull heave the heave is measured from a potentiometer mounted by the heave post calibrated to within 0 2 mm the heave post and sensor is number 6 in table a 1 and in fig a 1 accelerometers for the waves a set of accelerometers are used to measure the acceleration at certain points along the hull the sensors are 30g schaevitz closed loop torque balance transducers which can be mounted anywhere on the hull in this application one is put as close to the lcg position as possible and another is mounted a distance forwards closer to the bow as shown in fig a 1 the accelerometers are calibrated statically to within 0 03g the accelerometers are numbers 7 and 8 in table a 1 and in fig a 1 inclinometer to measure the static and running trim a gravity referenced inclinometer is used made by schaevitz it is their lso series which is a fully self contained fluid damped flexure suspension servo inclinometer calibrated to within 0 0005 deg the inclinometer is number 2 in table a 1 and fig a 1 sensor positions the appendages such as sensors and plates and their positions are listed in table a 1 and shown in fig a 1 in table a 1 xcg is the distance measured from the stern to the center point of each appendage and ycg is measured from the keel appendixb error and repeatability the measurements shown are the averages of the measurements for the repeated experiments the inherent uncertainty from sensors and fluctuations in the environment can be combined to predict the total uncertainty of the measurements in this paper the ittc s guidelines for calculating the uncertainty of measured data points was used ittc 2017a the total combined uncertainty u c for each speed and hull in percent is shown in table b 1 
22406,a conservative vorticity method for solving the 2 d incompressible unsteady viscous flow in the eulerian frame is proposed the numerical method implements the vorticity stream function formulation of the navier stokes n s equations solved by the cell centered finite volume method fvm a convection limiter coupling the first order upwind scheme and the quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme is introduced to maintain the accuracy and keep the monotonicity of vorticity interpolations the vorticity induced stream functions are recovered by a closed form expression which also accurately predicts the far field boundary conditions the convective flux is evaluated by the difference of stream functions on the neighboring two nodes which spontaneously eliminates the net mass flux out of a control cell the conservative fvm and quick scheme and the definite evaluations of stream functions and convective flux guarantee the conservation of circulation and mass the impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder at reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 9500 and the inline oscillatory flow around a circular cylinder at reynolds numbers 100 and 200 are numerically simulated using this method the current results under the inertial and non inertial translational frame are well validated by comparisons with other numerical and experimental benchmark tests keywords vorticity equation impulsively started flow oscillatory flow 2 d unsteady 1 introduction the purpose of this piece of work is to present an eulerian viscous vorticity equation visve 4 4 the present method is referred to as visve in this study for the sake of compact documentation method for 2 d incompressible unsteady viscous flow past a circular cylinder and the numerical results obtained by this method the vorticity methods evolve from the traditional computational methods for fluid dynamics into a distinguishing branch of approaches generally these methods are classified into two types according to the frame of reference the first class is known as the mesh free lagrangian methods which are also called the vortex blob methods or the discrete vortex methods chorin and bernard 1973 in these methods the motions of vortex blobs are described by a set of ordinary differential equations via splitting the convection and diffusion chorin 1973 so that the discrete point vortices are individually traced in time special treatments including the vortex merging algorithms nielsen and schwind 1971 moore 1974 or the artificial viscosity corrections chorin 1973 krasny 1987 are essential to avoid the singularity of point vortices and to keep the interactions between neighboring vortices bounded however several problems exist within the discrete vortex methods firstly an increasing number of particles is inevitable to capture the small scale structures developed over time which will impose great challenges on the computational resources in addition local refinements are necessary to keep the point vortices densely distributed to maintain the accuracy during longtime simulations saffman and meiron 1986 the growing spatial resolution will eventually be out of control and limit the affordable simulation time which triggers the blooms of certain fast algorithms lindsay and krasny 2001 ploumhans et al 2002 furthermore although the discrete vortex methods have been extensively used to study the development of vortex structures in the inviscid flow the incorporation of viscous diffusion is relatively complicated leonard 1980 last but not least the distance between two point vortices has to be limited to a certain range to have a smooth velocity field which could be difficult to accomplish for 3 d extensions of these methods the other class is named as the mesh based eulerian methods in which the governing equations can be numerically solved by methods such as finite difference method fdm or fvm whether the velocity or the stream function is used to represent the kinematics of the flow further categorizes these methods into the vorticity velocity formulation and the vorticity stream function formulation the velocity field and the vorticity field are usually associated by a poisson equation wu et al 1995 remarkably wu and thompson 1973 proposed an integro differential scheme that enables calculating the velocity by a direct and explicit integral of the vorticity since a known vorticity field uniquely determines the entire flow field munson et al 2014 the simulation of vorticity dynamics and the calculation of induced velocity can be separated into two consecutive steps that involve only the portion of grids with non zero vorticity the biggest advantage of this integro differential method is that the numerical simulation is confined to only the regions of interests and meanwhile the number of unknowns remains under control which further leads to a dramatic drop in the computational time and allows us the luxury of conducting longtime simulations in the current work the integro differential technique is reformulated to fit in with the vorticity stream function formulation of the n s equations whose number of unknown variables reduces to two the validations of the proposed vorticity method under the inertial frame are placed on predicting the unsteady viscous impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder the flow past an impulsively started cylinder is a well established prototype for unsteady flow since it reveals the structural characteristics of time dependent flow with separations and has triggered more than abundant amounts of academic investigations this problem imposes great difficulties on not only the experimental studies but also the numerical approaches because of the uniformly sudden beginning of the flow field the experiments should be properly designed to accommodate for the instantaneous launch of a cylinder in the quiescent flow coutanceau and bouard 1977a b the numerical schemes must resolve the initial vorticity generation to accurately model the sharp start and precisely catch the following development of topological structures in the wake formed by the interactions of multiple shedding vortices a considerable number of numerical attempts have been successfully made and yield promising results such as the finite difference scheme of anderson and reider 1996 the discrete vortex methods of koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and subramaniam 1997 the vorticity velocity formulation of qian and vezza 2001 and the lattice boltzmann application of li et al 2004 the above existing literature provides sufficient diagnostics including equi vorticity contours boundary layer profiles and body forces to validate the current method additionally the method is validated by simulating the unsteady viscous oscillatory flow around a circular cylinder in the non inertial frame of reference the inline oscillatory flow past a cylinder or the cylinder oscillating in the flow at rest has a variety of engineering applications especially in the fields of civil and offshore constructions the interests in this problem featured by complex vortex body and vortex vortex interactions arise from predicting the loads on structures subject to periodic waves or currents to optimize the design of structures chakrabarti 1987 experiments on this subject have been documented by williamson 1985 tatsuno and bearman 1990 and sarpkaya 1976 2002 who have conducted comprehensive research about the flow regimes and instantaneous forces sustained numerical studies which successfully recovered some of the experimental observations can be found in the publications of justesen 1991 badr et al 1995 dütsch et al 1998 zhou and graham 2000 guilmineau and queutey 2002 nehari et al 2004 elston et al 2006 and an et al 2011 the majority of the numerical simulations are based on 2 d models until some recent investigations elston et al 2006 nehari et al 2004 an et al 2011 focused on the 3 d symmetry breaking and instabilities experimentally visualized by honji 1981 the results such as velocity profiles vorticity contours and inline forces from the present method are compared with those of established benchmark tests to assess the accuracy of this method the impulsively started flow both unidirectional and oscillatory past a circular cylinder is a challenging and substantial topic especially for numerical simulations the methods should resolve both the early abrupt initiations and the subsequent separations the interests in numerical computations were started by payne 1958 following whom many methods have been proposed to solve this problem the discrete vortex methods were popular in predicting flow past a cylinder chang and chern 1991 smith and stansby 1988 koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 for some time but one major disadvantage of these methods is the ever increasing number of particles which limits the affordable simulation time the n s methods were also widely used to study these problems dennis and chang 1970 nieuwstadt and keller 1973 liu et al 1998 wright and smith 2001 calhoun 2002 russell and wang 2003 chiu et al 2010 pier 2002 sipp and lebedev 2007 marquet et al 2008 whose topics vary among flow regimes body forces and wake stability analyses however the n s based schemes usually require very large computational domains to guarantee unperturbed far field boundary conditions leading to a large number of cells in the grid lately researchers began to show interests in using the lattice boltzmann method to model the flow past cylinders mei and shyy 1998 guo and zhao 2003 imamura et al 2005 dupuis et al 2008 cui et al 2017 hejranfar and ezzatneshan 2014 most of the work only considers flow past a fixed cylinder at relatively low reynolds numbers 200 yet there are still doubts about their capability of resolving the impulsive start process at higher reynolds numbers in this work a conservative numerical method that solves for the vorticity in eulerian coordinates to simulate the incompressible unsteady viscous flow around bluff bodies in 2 d is proposed this method was originally proposed by tian and kinnas tian 2014 tian and kinnas 2015 it is designed to be spatially compact and computationally efficient and meanwhile capable of modeling the dynamics of vortices under both inertial and non inertial frame the integro differential scheme is improved to be compatible with the vorticity stream function formulation of the n s equations which are numerically solved by the cell centered fvm the mass flux of convection is calculated by the direct subtraction of the stream functions on adjacent cell nodes to automatically nullify the net flux of a control cell further the stream function poisson equation is solved based on the green s function and an analytical expression is derived to compute the vorticity induced stream functions on the cell vertices exactly in 2 d in addition the amount of vorticity created is determined by enforcing the non penetrating and no slip boundary conditions on the wall a convection limiter coupling the first order upwind scheme and the quick scheme to control the interpolations of vorticity is utilized in the current method to maintain the order of accuracy and resolve the sharp gradients of vorticity at the same time the special treatments of explicitly recovering the stream functions and convective flux and the conservativity of fvm and quick schemes guarantee the divergence free of velocity and preserve the vorticity throughout the numerical calculations the remainder is organized as follows the formulations and numerical schemes are explained in section 2 section 3 is devoted to showing the numerical results of impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder at reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 9500 to validate the proposed method under the inertial frame section 4 presents the results of oscillatory flow around a circular cylinder at reynolds numbers 100 and 200 to validate this method in the non inertial translating frame of reference section 5 gives comprehensive descriptions of the computational efficiency and parallelization finally the achievements and future work are discussed in section 6 2 formulations and numerical schemes 2 1 governing equations assuming the non inertial frame only moves with a time dependent velocity u t a translational acceleration term appears in the velocity pressure formulation of navier stokes equations 1 u t u u d u d t p ρ ν 2 u 2 u 0 where u u v is the velocity under the non inertial frame ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluids p is the pressure ρ is the density of the fluids and t is the time the vorticity in the non inertial frame of reference is the same as that under the inertial frame since the background flow u is homogeneous in space 3 ω v x u y it can be shown that by absorbing the transnational acceleration term into the pressure term as a potential in eq 1 the curl operation on this equation will result in a vorticity transport equation that takes the same form as the one in the inertial frame of reference 4 ω t u ω ν 2 ω with the initial and boundary conditions 5 u t 0 u u u b on body surface u u at infinity where u b is the velocity of the wall surface since a stationary 2 d cylinder is studied in this work u b 0 therefore the frame motion only enters into the solution of the problem through the initial and boundary conditions in 2 d the velocity u can be represented by the gradient of stream function ψ as 6 u ψ y ψ x the solving of the above system can be divided into a kinetic procedure and a kinematic procedure wu and thompson 1973 white 1976 the kinetic process convects and diffuses the vorticity produced from the wall surfaces in the flow domain by the vorticity equation 4 the kinematic process described by eqs 2 and 3 calculates the velocity or stream function corresponding to a given vorticity distribution also one needs to account for appropriate boundary conditions for both steps actually a closed form integral expression that recovers the velocity field from a known vorticity field can be found thompson 1971 the velocity field is sequentially used to determine the vorticity boundary conditions on the wall through a vorticity creation scheme in the present method the stream function is adopted instead of the velocity the flowchart of general solving procedures is shown in fig 1 2 2 vorticity transport equation while solving the vorticity equation 4 the velocity u is treated explicitly since the flow field is uniquely determined for a given vorticity distribution according to the helmholtz velocity decomposition eq 4 is solved by using the cell centered fvm considering the configuration of a control cell surrounded by 4 edges from the structural mesh as shown in fig 2 and applying the gauss theorem to the conservative form of eq 4 over the control cell we have the discretized vorticity equation as 7 a ω t f 1 4 m f ω f ν f 1 4 ω n f δ l f where δ l f indicates the edge length m f a f u n d l is the mass flux across a cell edge a is the area of the control cell a is the boundary enclosing the cell and n is the unit normal vector of the boundary pointing outwards under the fvm discretization boundary conditions are needed for eq 7 a the far field boundary condition is ω 0 b the out flow boundary condition is ω n 0 c the wall boundary condition is ω n 0 the homogeneous neumann boundary condition is recommended at all the boundaries except for the far field which is exhaustively reasoned by cottet et al 2000 the mass flux m can be calculated by knowing the stream functions ψ at both ends of the cell edge as given by eq 8 notice that the direction of the edge is determined by the right hand rule the most substantial benefit of using eq 8 is that the net mass flux out of a control cell is strictly 0 since the evaluation is exact 8 m ψ end ψ start in the current study the alternating directional implicit adi scheme proposed by peaceman and rachford 1955 is used to march the vorticity from the current time step t to the next time step t δ t where δ t is the time step size eq 7 is then split into two sweeps and expressed as 9 ω t δ t 2 1 δ t 2 c 1 d 1 1 1 δ t 2 c 2 d 2 ω t ω t δ t 1 δ t 2 c 2 d 2 1 1 δ t 2 c 1 d 1 ω t δ t 2 where c 1 2 and d 1 2 are the convective and diffusive coefficients in two directions the interpolations of convective terms are evaluated by a convection limiter which will be described thoroughly in section 2 3 the diffusive terms are calculated by a linear interpolation scheme since the grids used in this application are orthogonal 2 3 convection limiter the convection limiter is a hybrid algorithm combined the first order upwind scheme with the quick scheme the quick scheme was originally introduced by leonard 1979 and the formulation for non uniform grids was derived by ferziger and peric 2012 even though the quick scheme is third order in space and extremely conservative it encounters considerable difficulties in interpolating values involving sharp gradient changes especially in case of vorticity simulations the vortical flow regions are enclosed by distinct borders and the quick scheme would give nonphysical results near the borders where the impulsive gradient variations exist hence a convection limiter is implemented in the present method the first order upwind scheme is employed to keep the results monotone for large gradients the quick scheme is used to maintain the order of accuracy for small and mild gradients the quick scheme corrected by the convection limiter f θ woodfield et al 2004 in terms of variable ξ reads 10 ξ e ξ u f θ l x e x u l x e x u u l x d x u l x d x u u ξ d ξ u l x e x u l x e x d l x u x u u l x d x u u ξ u ξ u u where e u u u and d represent the current edge the far upwind cell the near upwind cell and the downwind cell respectively the function l x 1 x 2 calculates the distance between two locations x 1 and x 2 θ is a non dimensionalized variable that

shown in fig 3 δ should be wisely chosen to strike a good balance between less numerical dissipation and lower risks of failures in the present study δ is set to be 0 2 which is also recommended by woodfield et al 2004 from a series of numerical tests in addition the quick scheme will conflict with the adi solver therefore the high order terms in eq 10 are put into the rhs of the algebraic system which is subsequently solved by using the deferred correction technique richardson and gaunt 1927 2 4 stream function calculation the velocity field and the vorticity field are related through the stream function ψ for a given vorticity field the stream functions at the nodes of the control cells should be retrieved in order to march equation 7 to the next time step considering the relation between u and ψ in eq 6 eq 3 becomes 13 2 ψ ω eq 13 is solved by using green s function in 2 d thompson 1971 wu and thompson 1973 14 ψ x c ϒ ω x ln x c x 2 π d υ ψ i n here x c is the location where ψ is evaluated and the dummy variable x runs through the integral domain ϒ covering all the vortical flow regions ψ i n y u 1 x u 2 is the stream function of the background flow u u 1 u 2 supposing that the vorticity is constant within every control cell eq 14 is split into the numerical summation of the influence of all cells where the vorticity exists an analytical solution of eq 14 for a control cell with uniform vorticity distribution is derived in appendix applying eq 14 throughout the domain is relatively expensive the computational complexity is o n 2 for n cells in the vortical regions however the computation effort is nevertheless under control in 2 d applications especially with proper parallelization as explained in section 5 to achieve better performance on a single core processor several fast algorithms can be utilized such as the fast multipole method fmm of o n log n by lindsay and krasny 2001 and the fmm of o n by greengard and rokhlin 1987 alternatively certain numerical methods including the fvm the fdm or the finite element method fem for elliptic partial differential equations can be adopted to solve the poisson equation 13 but one has to treat the non orthogonality of the grids in this case 2 5 vorticity creation on the wall the convection and diffusion of vorticity are described by eq 4 and meanwhile the vorticity generated from the wall surface should also be included in the flow the vorticity creation can be modeled as a surface vorticity distribution or a vortex sheet on the wall chorin 1978 the strength of the vortex sheet is evaluated by enforcing the non penetrating and no slip boundary conditions of the velocity field determined by a known vorticity field koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 assuming at time step t the correct velocity field u t advances the vorticity from the current time step ω t to the next time step ω ˆ t δ t however ω ˆ t δ t will induce a velocity field that has normal components u ˆ n t δ t ψ ˆ t δ t s and tangential components u ˆ s t δ t ψ ˆ t δ t n on the wall boundaries where n and s are defined in fig 4 note that the velocity u ˆ t δ t includes the contribution of both the vorticity and the background flow in order to assure the non penetrating boundary condition alaplace s equation for the potential ϕ is solved cottet et al 2000 15 2 ϕ 0 with the kinematic boundary condition on the wall surface 16 ϕ n u ˆ n t δ t ψ ˆ t δ t s in the present method eq 15 is transformed into an integral form by using green s second identity in 2 d kellogg 1953 and solved based on the boundary element method bem banerjee and butterfield 1981 to obtain the potential ϕ on the wall the gradient of ϕ together with the tangential velocity u ˆ s t δ t on the wall is converted into the surface vorticity distribution γ 17 γ ϕ s ψ ˆ t δ t n the surface vorticity γ shares the same dimension with the velocity m s actually γ is defined as the vortex sheet strength ω h as the height of the sheet h 0 notably the potential ϕ only contributes to the surface vorticity γ on the wall and does not affect the other parts of the domain the created surface vorticity γ is successively released into the flow field which acts as implementing the no slip boundary condition every point on the wall can release the created vorticity ω γ from the body surface koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 established a relation between the surface vorticity γ and the normal vorticity flux ω γ n across the wall 18 ν ω γ n γ δ t the surface vorticity γ enters the flow domain by a diffusion equation 19 with the neumann type boundary condition 18 on the wall the homogeneous far field dirichlet boundary condition ω γ t δ t 0 and the homogeneous initial condition ω γ t 0 19 ω γ t ν 2 ω γ eq 19 is numerically solved by using the fvm in the exact same way of solving equation 4 eventually the vorticity at time step t δ t reads 20 ω t δ t ω ˆ t δ t ω γ t δ t 2 6 surface pressure and sheer stress calculation in the viscous flow the non penetrating and no slip boundary conditions require zero velocity on the fixed body surface so the unsteady term and the convective term in the momentum equation disappear on the body surface considering a local coordinate system on the surface of body s n as shown in fig 4 in which s represents the unit vector tangential to the wall and n is the unit vector normal to the wall the momentum equation is further simplified to 21 p s μ ω n where p represents the pressure and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluids in eq 21 ω n is already known from the vorticity creation process and p s describes how the pressure field changes on the body surface therefore once the pressure at an arbitrary point is given the pressure along the body surface can be evaluated according to eq 21 in the current work the pressure at the upstream stagnation point is chosen to be the reference and calculated using bernoulli s equation which is ρ u 2 2 the shear stress τ on the body surface is determined by the changing rate of tangential velocity u s in the normal direction recalling the vorticity defined by eq 3 in 2 d since the normal velocity u n is strictly zero on the body surface it can be shown that the surface shear stress is directly related to the vorticity on the wall 22 τ μ ω the total external force exerting on the body f f d f l is the summation of pressure force f p and friction force f τ which are calculated by integrating the pressure and the shear stress along the body surface s b respectively 23 f f p f τ s b p n d l s b τ s d l where f l is the lift and f d is the drag they are the components of f in the global cartesian coordinate system the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d are non dimensionalized by ρ u 2 r 3 numerical results of impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder the proposed method is applied to the impulsively started flow initialized as the inviscid flow with a slip boundary condition on the wall past a circular cylinder to validate its accuracy and robustness in the inertial frame of reference this type of problem is unanimously believed to be the standard benchmark test for unsteady separated flow and has been widely investigated in this study the cylinder with a diameter of d locates at the origin x d y d 0 0 of the global coordinate system and the uniform inflow comes in the x direction a circular computational domain with a radius of 14 5 d is used for the simulations as shown in fig 5 the grid grows uniformly in the circumferential direction s and exponentially in the normal direction n although such a large computational domain is overkill for the vorticity methods as indicated by anderson and reider 1996 remarkably the calculations are only conducted in a small fraction of the grids where the vorticity is non zero the reynolds number r e is defined as 24 r e 2 u r ν where r d 2 is the radius of the cylinder u is the inflow velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluids the strouhal number s t is defined as 25 s t 2 f i r u 2 r u t i where f i and t i represent the frequency and period of the vortex shedding respectively the non dimensional time t is defined as 26 t t u r in this section the flow development at early flow times during which the wake exhibits rather complex shedding structures for r e 550 1000 3000 and 9500 along with the late stage vortex shedding phase for r e 100 and 200 are presented the descriptions of wake structures in the very early phase are provided for only half of the wake because the flow is symmetric with respect to the flow axis which is also the x axis defined in fig 4 before the periodic vortex shedding begins for these reynolds numbers bouard and coutanceau 1980 3 1 grid and time step size dependence study a grid dependence study is conducted for the impulsively started cylinder at reynolds number r e 3000 with various grid resolutions circumferential direction normal direction three levels of grid resolution are considered including the coarse grid 100 80 the medium grid 200 135 and the fine grid 300 190 the surface pressure coefficient distributions at t 2 0 given in fig 6 a verify that the solutions become independent on grids as the resolution increases also the results are found to be in line with those calculated by anderson and reider 1996 additionally the influence of time step size on the results is investigated the simulations are performed in the medium grid with a time step size δ t 1 0 1 0 2 2 0 1 0 3 and 4 0 1 0 4 respectively it is obvious that the surface pressure coefficient distributions are not dependent on the time step size if δ t is larger than 2 0 1 0 3 as shown in fig 6 b during the simulations the absolute total circulation is limited within 1 0 1 0 9 and the absolute total net mass flux is controlled under 1 0 1 0 14 3 2 impulsively started process for r e 550 1000 3000 and 9500 in this part the initial stages of the impulsively started flow past a cylinder are studied the results from the present method are compared with other numerical results koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 anderson and reider 1996 subramaniam 1997 qian and vezza 2001 and experimental data bouard and coutanceau 1980 koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and subramaniam 1997 studied the early stage growth of wake behind the cylinder using the mesh free discrete vortex methods similar studies were carried out by anderson and reider 1996 who solved the n s equations using the finite difference schemes of both second order and fourth order qian and vezza 2001 simulated not only the start but also the longtime evolution of the flow past a cylinder based on the vorticity velocity formulation of the n s equations bouard and coutanceau 1980 meticulously designed the experiments to achieve the abrupt initiation of the impulsively started cylinder and investigated the wake and separations behind the cylinder by visualizations at reynolds numbers ranging from 40 to 1 0 4 3 2 1 r e 550 firstly the impulsively started flow at r e 550 is simulated using the proposed method the grid with a number of elements 200 135 and the first layer grid size in the normal direction h 0 d 0 001 is utilized for the calculation the time step size to march the flow in time is δ t 0 002 fig 7 compares the instantaneous streamlines produced by the present method with the visualized flow patterns obtained from the experiments of bouard and coutanceau 1980 at t 5 0 after the flow starts from rest vorticity is created from the body surface and shed into the domain and a recirculating region is formed by multiple vortical structures in the wake particularly in this case a secondary vortex bounded by a primary vortex is observed in fig 7 the radial velocity distributions along the rear centerline of the cylinder are compared with those computed by subramaniam 1997 qian and vezza 2001 and dupuis et al 2008 at flow times t 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 which are illustrated graphically in fig 8 the velocity is negative within the recirculating zone due to the reversed flow and reaches a minimum value at a specific location the intercepts where the velocity profiles cross the x axis u u 0 other than the origin also reveal the evolution in time of the wake length the wake length as well as the minimum velocity and its location can all be used to characterize the wake configuration and the comparisons show good agreement in addition the development in time of drag coefficients calculated by the present method closely matches the predictions of both koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and qian and vezza 2001 as given in fig 9 3 2 2 r e 1000 also the flow at r e 1000 is studied in this case the grid with a resolution 200 135 and h 0 d 0 001 is generated for the simulation the time step size is δ t 0 002 the chronological development of the vorticity in the wake is given in fig 10 as equal value contours demonstrating that the present method well captures the phenomena α bouard and coutanceau 1980 it is seen in particular that a primary vortex is generated behind the cylinder in half of the recirculating region immediately after the flow starts and grows quickly with time later a secondary vortex begins to develop at t 2 0 due to the separation of the primary vortex from a thin layer into a strong vortex that rotates in the opposite direction of and is enclosed by the primary vortex the vorticity contours from the current method are in good agreement with those provided by qian and vezza 2001 anderson and reider 1996 and koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 the evolution of vortices behind the cylinder is directly manifested in the variation of surface vorticity fig 11 shows the surface vorticity distributions compared with those from qian and vezza 2001 at flow times t 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 which also show good agreement the changes in the strength of the primary and secondary vortices in time are clearly observed in fig 11 the readers may notice from the curves that a tertiary vortex hardly identified from the vorticity contours emerges at later times this vortex is more distinctly observable for higher reynolds numbers additionally the present drag coefficients are almost the same as the results offered by koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and qian and vezza 2001 as shown in fig 12 actually the variation in drag history is a result of the interactions between the primary and secondary vortices in the beginning the drag continuously drops due to the growth of primary vortex after the primary vortex starts to separate from the cylinder the formation and development of the secondary vortex raise the drag to a maximum value then further separations of the primary vortex and the decay of the secondary vortex gradually reduce the drag 3 2 3 r e 3000 further the reynolds number is increased to be r e 3000 in this test the grid with 200 135 cells and h 0 d 0 001 is used together with a time step size δ t 0 002 to advance in time the wake evolution with time is described in equal value contours of vorticity in fig 13 at a higher reynolds number the primary vortex generates a larger adverse pressure gradient which induces a stronger secondary vortex that subsequently creates a distinguished tertiary vortex the tertiary vortex stops the secondary vortex from going through the primary one these three vortical structures appear in a temporal and logical order the primary vortex is firstly formed and dominates the flow and the secondary vortex is induced as the primary vortex begins to isolate from the cylinder similarly the development and separation of the secondary vortex create the tertiary vortex this remarkable phenomenon has also been detected by koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 anderson and reider 1996 and qian and vezza 2001 which can be reliable sources for the examinations of the current results the streamlines at t 5 are compared with the experimental observations by bouard and coutanceau 1980 in fig 14 which also offers essential insights into the interactions between the primary vortex the secondary vortex and the tertiary vortex in fact the vortices in the wake significantly affect the surface vorticity in fig 15 the surface vorticity distributions are presented along with the results from qian and vezza 2001 at flow times t 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 strong spatial fluctuations in the surface vorticity which also exposes the changes of the vortex strength are observed the secondary vortex appears at about t 2 0 and its strength keeps increasing as the secondary vortex grows and attempts to penetrate the primary vortex the strength of the primary one decreases due to the diffusion and weakened feeding later at t 3 0 another vortex is generated that fights against the secondary vortex from cutting off the feeding of the primary vortex the interactions between the secondary and tertiary vortices increase the strength of both of them for a short period of time and the primary vortex gains strength again due to the reinforced feeding eventually the strength of all three vortices decays slowly through diffusion as the wake tends to be steady before the vortex shedding is initiated fig 16 shows the comparisons of radial velocity distributions along the rear flow axis behind the cylinder with those computed by subramaniam 1997 and qian and vezza 2001 at flow times t 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 in general the results are almost the same 3 2 4 r e 9500 the impulsively started flow at r e 9500 is critical for the numerical methods because of the complex wake structures and separation details for this simulation the grid with a number of 300 200 cells and h 0 d 0 0005 is used in conjunction with a time step size δ t 0 002 fig 17 displays how the wake advances in time in terms of equi vorticity contours and streamlines and also gives the experimental results from bouard and coutanceau 1980 as validations of the present work the phenomenon β is evidently seen during the development of flow bouard and coutanceau 1980 in the beginning a thin layer of vortex is formed and soon grows to be the primary vortex after a small lapse of time this strong primary vortex splits the wake into 2 regions a pair of secondary counter rotating vortices appears near the front separation point and the tertiary vortex separates from the primary one in the vicinity of the rear reattachment point the contours from a high resolution simulation are accessible in the publication of koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 the comparisons with lower reynolds numbers confirm that the decrease in viscosity results in the growth of small scale structures in the wake as the reynolds number increases the same trend can also be observed from the rising oscillations of surface vorticity the surface vorticity variations with time as computed by the current method koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and qian and vezza 2001 are shown in fig 18 at flow times t 0 4 1 0 1 2 1 8 and 2 0 the decrease in viscosity at higher reynolds numbers leads to weaker diffusion as a result the wake tends to be unstable and vulnerable to perturbations compared with the previous cases the strength of the inner secondary vortex is much larger and increases quickly as the vortex grows under thin diffusion this strong secondary vortex penetrates and splits the primary vortex rapidly since the viscosity is no longer effective enough to hold the vortices together the primary vortex then starts to absorb the tertiary vortex and detach from the cylinder additionally the radial velocity distributions along the rear centerline of the cylinder are compared with the results obtained by subramaniam 1997 and qian and vezza 2001 at flow times t 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 the corresponding graphic representations are given in fig 19 3 3 vortex shedding in longtime simulation for r e 100 and 200 in this part the longtime evolution of impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder at r e 100 and 200 is presented to assess the present method in capturing the periodic vortex shedding the mesh with 200 210 elements and the first layer grid size in the normal direction h 0 d 0 001 is adopted with a time step size δ t 0 002 the radius of the computational domain is increased to be 17 0 d the vortex shedding phase will not be automatically activated by the numerical errors even when t approaches 200 because of the highly conservative scheme therefore the vortex shedding is triggered manually by a perturbation at a relatively early time the impulsively started flow past a cylinder at r e 100 and r e 200 is simulated using the present method respectively the evolution of lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d eventually develops into steady sinusoidal fluctuations due to the periodic vortex shedding during the longtime simulation as plotted in fig 20 the lift coefficient drag coefficient and strouhal number predicted by the current method during the established shedding phase are compared with the results of other latest studies as shown in table 1 the present results agree well with them quantitatively the amplitude of lift drag coefficient and the strouhal number at r e 200 are larger than those at r e 100 during the vortex shedding phase which is caused by the drop of viscosity fig 21 displays a snapshot of the alternating vortices shed behind the cylinder in terms of vorticity contours a much shorter distance between two neighboring vortices is observed at r e 200 than that at r e 100 also the vortices are dissipated much faster by the larger viscosity at r e 100 4 numerical results of oscillatory flow past a circular cylinder the inline oscillatory flow past a stationary circular cylinder is simulated to show the capability and accuracy of the proposed method under the non inertial frame in translation this problem is of diverse interests to both hydrodynamic and structural academia blevins 1977 in addition the accurate predictions of time dependent loads on structures matter enormously in the civil and offshore industry naudascher and rockwell 2012 similar to the unidirectional flow the cylinder with a diameter of d is fixed at the origin x d y d 0 0 of the global coordinate system the circular computational domain has a radius of 10 0 d and the flow oscillates along the x direction with a sinusoidal velocity 27 u u o cos 2 π f o t where u o is the maximum velocity of the oscillatory inflow and f o is the frequency of the velocity oscillation the oscillatory flow is characterized by the keulegan carpenter number k c and the reynolds number r e the reynolds number of the oscillatory flow is defined as 28 r e u o d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluids the keulegan carpenter number is defined as 29 k c u o t o d where t o 1 f o is the period of the oscillatory flow further the ratio of r e to k c gives the frequency parameter or stokes number β which is expressed as 30 β r e k c d 2 ν t o 2 d oscillatory flow past a circular cylinder only exists at low k c and r e numbers tatsuno and bearman 1990 within the scope of current work the oscillatory flow at r e 100 k c 5 is firstly studied in this section to validate the proposed method in the non inertial translating frame of reference the present results are checked against other numerical schemes and experimental visualizations dütsch et al 1998 numerically reproduced three regimes found by tatsuno and bearman 1990 in 2 d and in particular provided experimental measurements as validations guilmineau and queutey 2002 carried out similar studies on a 2 d circular cylinder subject to inline oscillations with extensions to cross flow oscillations an et al 2011 conducted direct numerical simulations to investigate the honji vortices honji 1981 in oscillatory flow past a 3 d circular cylinder and discovered that the instabilities are directly related to β upon validations the results of oscillatory flow at r e 200 k c 1 2 and 4 are further presented to investigate the influence of k c number on the inline forces exerting on the cylinder the k c and r e numbers used here are small such that the flow is symmetric and subcritical and laminar boundary layers can be established sarpkaya 1986 4 1 r e 100 and k c 5 in this case the grid with a resolution 300 150 and h 0 d 0 001 is built for the simulation the time step size is δ t 0 002 according to the classifications of tatsuno and bearman 1990 a combination of k c 5 and r e 100 falls into the category of regime a of which the flow is 2 d and symmetric with respect to the x axis and separations occur periodically fig 22 displays the development of vorticity in half a cycle when the cylinder begins to move in the positive x direction from its maximum negative location at first two thin layers of vorticity ① partially bounded by a pair of vortices ② and a pair of fully detached vortices ③ are observed the motion of the cylinder causes the growth of vortices ① from thin layers into a pair of dominant vortices accompanied by the separation of vortices ② which gradually fade together with vortices ③ due to diffusion eventually the feeding links of vortices ① are cut off by the formation of two new thin layers of vorticity ④ on the wall surface fig 23 shows the comparisons of velocity profiles at different locations and phase angles 2 π f o t between the current solutions and the experimental results of dütsch et al 1998 notably the measurements by dütsch et al 1998 were made with respect to the fluids on the contrary the current numerical simulations adopted a cylinder fixed global coordinate system therefore coordinates transformations were conducted to produce reasonable comparisons as is seen in fig 23 the results share the same trend in general but still exhibit some visual discrepancies to further demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method the velocity profiles are compared with the numerical results predicted by dütsch et al 1998 guilmineau and queutey 2002 as well as an et al 2011 in fig 24 which shows good agreement in the simulations of dütsch et al 1998 and guilmineau and queutey 2002 the cylinder is forced to oscillate in the quiescent flow in contrast the flow field alternates around the fixed cylinder in the present method which provides a different perspective to view the same problem under the non inertial frame it is noteworthy to point out that similar deviations in velocity profiles also exist between the experimental data of dütsch et al 1998 and the numerical results of the mentioned three studies dütsch et al 1998 guilmineau and queutey 2002 an et al 2011 finally the variations of inline force coefficients non dimensionalized by ρ u o 2 r in time are reported in fig 25 4 2 r e 200 and k c 1 2 4 in this part the grid and time step size are the same as the previous case the reynolds number is raised to be 200 the flow at a k c number of 1 2 and 4 is simulated using the current method respectively the vorticity contours are shown in fig 26 at a phase angle of 180 for k c 1 2 and 4 it is seen that the vorticity is attached to the cylinder at lower k c numbers but separations will occur for the flow at larger k c numbers the developments of inline force coefficients non dimensionalized by ρ u o 2 r in time are displayed in fig 27 similar to the case at r e 100 and k c 5 the pressure part contributes much more to the total force than the friction part does for all k c numbers presented in this work the authors also notice a drop in the total force mostly resulting from the reduction of pressure force when the k c number increases the reason for this decline is that a higher k c number means a larger period of the oscillation and a lower acceleration which generates a milder adverse pressure gradient on the down stream side of the cylinder a closer look at the friction force is given in fig 28 demonstrating the decrease of friction force as the k c number rises which shares the same trend of how the pressure force changes with the k c number according to eq 22 the friction force is proportional to the intensity of vorticity also the velocity gradient on the wall the vorticity has enough time to convect away and detach from the cylinder for higher k c numbers while in contrast the vorticity is largely confined to the regions near the cylinder for lower k c numbers as shown in fig 26 therefore the flow at smaller k c numbers is characterized with larger vorticity magnitude in the vicinity of the cylinder resulting in bigger friction force 5 computational efficiency and parallelization to show the efficiency of the proposed vorticity method an analysis of the computational complexity is conducted in the simulation of an impulsively started cylinder at r e 3000 and r e 200 the cells actively involved in the calculations are defined as the occupied cells whose vorticity magnitude is larger than a predefined value 10 6 in this study firstly at r e 3000 the number of occupied cells used in the present method is compared in particular with those of koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and kevlahan and vasilyev 2005 who put forward a wavelet method to calculate the flow around a cylinder at flow time t 6 0 to resolve the fine wake comprised of several eddies 3 0 1 0 5 particles are employed by koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 in the discrete vortex method as opposed to only 1 3 1 0 4 which is about 23 times smaller occupied cells utilized in the current method in the work of kevlahan and vasilyev 2005 4 3 1 0 4 which is 3 3 times larger than the number of occupied cells in the present method wavelets are necessary to capture the wake structures however the computational cost of one wavelet element over a vorticity cell is hard to quantify as indicated by kevlahan and vasilyev 2005 additionally the size of the computational domain and the number of cells in the grid are compared between the current method and the n s methods as shown in table 2 at a reynolds number around 200 as is seen the present method has a much smaller computational domain and a less number of cells the authors also remark that the actual number of occupied cells involved in the computations is only a small fraction of the total number it therefore is obvious that the present method is more efficient compared with the other methods in terms of computational complexity the coarse grid with much fewer cells produces comparably fine results of the other methods in order to further improve the computational efficiency the present numerical scheme is paralleled the most time consuming part which turns out to be the stream function calculations and takes 99 of the total time cost is located by profiling since the data of spatially connected cells is not necessarily stored in the memory continuously the vectorization which is the vector calculation of a processor does not function effectively in case of random memory access however the evaluations of eq 14 are perfect for parallel computing in which independent calculations are performed by multiple computer processors simultaneously because the computations of inductions using eq 14 are not dependent on each other the work can be distributed to available processors and conducted at the same time the speed up of parallelization in terms of strong scaling amdahl 1967 and the number of processors used exhibit an almost ideally linear relationship in fig 29 in which the speed up is defined as t 1 t n where t n is the time cost using n processors and t 1 is the time cost using 1 processor 6 conclusions and future work a conservative vorticity method that solves the vorticity stream function formulation of navier stokes equations in the eulerian coordinates is proposed to simulate the incompressible unsteady viscous flow past bluff bodies in 2 d the numerical scheme is based on the modified integro differential technique which permits the simulation to be limited to only the regions with non zero vorticity the computation is then split into two consecutive steps that are the solving of vorticity transport equation using the cell centered fvm and the recovery of stream functions using an analytical solution the exact evaluations of mass flux from the explicitly calculated stream functions further secure the continuity of velocity field to ensure the accuracy and monotonicity of vorticity interpolations a convection limiter coupling the first order upwind scheme and the quick scheme is implemented in addition a vorticity creation scheme effectively resolving the impulsive initiation and boundary layer distribution is employed to determine the amount of vorticity released from the wall by imposing the boundary conditions on the body surface the conservative fvm and quick scheme and the exact evaluations of stream functions and convective flux together construct a numerical scheme that ensures the conservation of circulation and mass the proposed vorticity method has been validated by simulating the impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder at reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 9500 in the inertial frame of reference and the oscillatory flow around a circular cylinder at r e 100 k c 5 as well as r e 200 k c 1 2 4 in the non inertial translational frame of reference the present results coincide well with those from other established numerical and experimental benchmark tests demonstrating that the current method produces high quality results for both early stage evolution and longtime vortex shedding phase of the flow past a circular cylinder even in comparatively coarse grids the current method can simulate 2 d laminar flow past solid bodies in both inertial and non inertial translational frame of reference in an efficient way even though only the results of the flow past a circular cylinder are shown in this work the method can be applied to lifting or bluff bodies of arbitrary shapes the method can also handle turbulent flow past a 2 d hydrofoil yao and kinnas 2019 with appropriate modifications or cavitating flow xing et al 2018 also this method is being extended to 3 d and a preliminary study about the flow past a 3 d hydrofoil has been shown by wu and kinnas 2019 due to the advantage of promising efficiency this method has the potential for simulating the flow around 3 d long cylinders such as the risers connecting a subsea oil well to an offshore platform acknowledgments support for

22406,a conservative vorticity method for solving the 2 d incompressible unsteady viscous flow in the eulerian frame is proposed the numerical method implements the vorticity stream function formulation of the navier stokes n s equations solved by the cell centered finite volume method fvm a convection limiter coupling the first order upwind scheme and the quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme is introduced to maintain the accuracy and keep the monotonicity of vorticity interpolations the vorticity induced stream functions are recovered by a closed form expression which also accurately predicts the far field boundary conditions the convective flux is evaluated by the difference of stream functions on the neighboring two nodes which spontaneously eliminates the net mass flux out of a control cell the conservative fvm and quick scheme and the definite evaluations of stream functions and convective flux guarantee the conservation of circulation and mass the impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder at reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 9500 and the inline oscillatory flow around a circular cylinder at reynolds numbers 100 and 200 are numerically simulated using this method the current results under the inertial and non inertial translational frame are well validated by comparisons with other numerical and experimental benchmark tests keywords vorticity equation impulsively started flow oscillatory flow 2 d unsteady 1 introduction the purpose of this piece of work is to present an eulerian viscous vorticity equation visve 4 4 the present method is referred to as visve in this study for the sake of compact documentation method for 2 d incompressible unsteady viscous flow past a circular cylinder and the numerical results obtained by this method the vorticity methods evolve from the traditional computational methods for fluid dynamics into a distinguishing branch of approaches generally these methods are classified into two types according to the frame of reference the first class is known as the mesh free lagrangian methods which are also called the vortex blob methods or the discrete vortex methods chorin and bernard 1973 in these methods the motions of vortex blobs are described by a set of ordinary differential equations via splitting the convection and diffusion chorin 1973 so that the discrete point vortices are individually traced in time special treatments including the vortex merging algorithms nielsen and schwind 1971 moore 1974 or the artificial viscosity corrections chorin 1973 krasny 1987 are essential to avoid the singularity of point vortices and to keep the interactions between neighboring vortices bounded however several problems exist within the discrete vortex methods firstly an increasing number of particles is inevitable to capture the small scale structures developed over time which will impose great challenges on the computational resources in addition local refinements are necessary to keep the point vortices densely distributed to maintain the accuracy during longtime simulations saffman and meiron 1986 the growing spatial resolution will eventually be out of control and limit the affordable simulation time which triggers the blooms of certain fast algorithms lindsay and krasny 2001 ploumhans et al 2002 furthermore although the discrete vortex methods have been extensively used to study the development of vortex structures in the inviscid flow the incorporation of viscous diffusion is relatively complicated leonard 1980 last but not least the distance between two point vortices has to be limited to a certain range to have a smooth velocity field which could be difficult to accomplish for 3 d extensions of these methods the other class is named as the mesh based eulerian methods in which the governing equations can be numerically solved by methods such as finite difference method fdm or fvm whether the velocity or the stream function is used to represent the kinematics of the flow further categorizes these methods into the vorticity velocity formulation and the vorticity stream function formulation the velocity field and the vorticity field are usually associated by a poisson equation wu et al 1995 remarkably wu and thompson 1973 proposed an integro differential scheme that enables calculating the velocity by a direct and explicit integral of the vorticity since a known vorticity field uniquely determines the entire flow field munson et al 2014 the simulation of vorticity dynamics and the calculation of induced velocity can be separated into two consecutive steps that involve only the portion of grids with non zero vorticity the biggest advantage of this integro differential method is that the numerical simulation is confined to only the regions of interests and meanwhile the number of unknowns remains under control which further leads to a dramatic drop in the computational time and allows us the luxury of conducting longtime simulations in the current work the integro differential technique is reformulated to fit in with the vorticity stream function formulation of the n s equations whose number of unknown variables reduces to two the validations of the proposed vorticity method under the inertial frame are placed on predicting the unsteady viscous impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder the flow past an impulsively started cylinder is a well established prototype for unsteady flow since it reveals the structural characteristics of time dependent flow with separations and has triggered more than abundant amounts of academic investigations this problem imposes great difficulties on not only the experimental studies but also the numerical approaches because of the uniformly sudden beginning of the flow field the experiments should be properly designed to accommodate for the instantaneous launch of a cylinder in the quiescent flow coutanceau and bouard 1977a b the numerical schemes must resolve the initial vorticity generation to accurately model the sharp start and precisely catch the following development of topological structures in the wake formed by the interactions of multiple shedding vortices a considerable number of numerical attempts have been successfully made and yield promising results such as the finite difference scheme of anderson and reider 1996 the discrete vortex methods of koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and subramaniam 1997 the vorticity velocity formulation of qian and vezza 2001 and the lattice boltzmann application of li et al 2004 the above existing literature provides sufficient diagnostics including equi vorticity contours boundary layer profiles and body forces to validate the current method additionally the method is validated by simulating the unsteady viscous oscillatory flow around a circular cylinder in the non inertial frame of reference the inline oscillatory flow past a cylinder or the cylinder oscillating in the flow at rest has a variety of engineering applications especially in the fields of civil and offshore constructions the interests in this problem featured by complex vortex body and vortex vortex interactions arise from predicting the loads on structures subject to periodic waves or currents to optimize the design of structures chakrabarti 1987 experiments on this subject have been documented by williamson 1985 tatsuno and bearman 1990 and sarpkaya 1976 2002 who have conducted comprehensive research about the flow regimes and instantaneous forces sustained numerical studies which successfully recovered some of the experimental observations can be found in the publications of justesen 1991 badr et al 1995 dütsch et al 1998 zhou and graham 2000 guilmineau and queutey 2002 nehari et al 2004 elston et al 2006 and an et al 2011 the majority of the numerical simulations are based on 2 d models until some recent investigations elston et al 2006 nehari et al 2004 an et al 2011 focused on the 3 d symmetry breaking and instabilities experimentally visualized by honji 1981 the results such as velocity profiles vorticity contours and inline forces from the present method are compared with those of established benchmark tests to assess the accuracy of this method the impulsively started flow both unidirectional and oscillatory past a circular cylinder is a challenging and substantial topic especially for numerical simulations the methods should resolve both the early abrupt initiations and the subsequent separations the interests in numerical computations were started by payne 1958 following whom many methods have been proposed to solve this problem the discrete vortex methods were popular in predicting flow past a cylinder chang and chern 1991 smith and stansby 1988 koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 for some time but one major disadvantage of these methods is the ever increasing number of particles which limits the affordable simulation time the n s methods were also widely used to study these problems dennis and chang 1970 nieuwstadt and keller 1973 liu et al 1998 wright and smith 2001 calhoun 2002 russell and wang 2003 chiu et al 2010 pier 2002 sipp and lebedev 2007 marquet et al 2008 whose topics vary among flow regimes body forces and wake stability analyses however the n s based schemes usually require very large computational domains to guarantee unperturbed far field boundary conditions leading to a large number of cells in the grid lately researchers began to show interests in using the lattice boltzmann method to model the flow past cylinders mei and shyy 1998 guo and zhao 2003 imamura et al 2005 dupuis et al 2008 cui et al 2017 hejranfar and ezzatneshan 2014 most of the work only considers flow past a fixed cylinder at relatively low reynolds numbers 200 yet there are still doubts about their capability of resolving the impulsive start process at higher reynolds numbers in this work a conservative numerical method that solves for the vorticity in eulerian coordinates to simulate the incompressible unsteady viscous flow around bluff bodies in 2 d is proposed this method was originally proposed by tian and kinnas tian 2014 tian and kinnas 2015 it is designed to be spatially compact and computationally efficient and meanwhile capable of modeling the dynamics of vortices under both inertial and non inertial frame the integro differential scheme is improved to be compatible with the vorticity stream function formulation of the n s equations which are numerically solved by the cell centered fvm the mass flux of convection is calculated by the direct subtraction of the stream functions on adjacent cell nodes to automatically nullify the net flux of a control cell further the stream function poisson equation is solved based on the green s function and an analytical expression is derived to compute the vorticity induced stream functions on the cell vertices exactly in 2 d in addition the amount of vorticity created is determined by enforcing the non penetrating and no slip boundary conditions on the wall a convection limiter coupling the first order upwind scheme and the quick scheme to control the interpolations of vorticity is utilized in the current method to maintain the order of accuracy and resolve the sharp gradients of vorticity at the same time the special treatments of explicitly recovering the stream functions and convective flux and the conservativity of fvm and quick schemes guarantee the divergence free of velocity and preserve the vorticity throughout the numerical calculations the remainder is organized as follows the formulations and numerical schemes are explained in section 2 section 3 is devoted to showing the numerical results of impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder at reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 9500 to validate the proposed method under the inertial frame section 4 presents the results of oscillatory flow around a circular cylinder at reynolds numbers 100 and 200 to validate this method in the non inertial translating frame of reference section 5 gives comprehensive descriptions of the computational efficiency and parallelization finally the achievements and future work are discussed in section 6 2 formulations and numerical schemes 2 1 governing equations assuming the non inertial frame only moves with a time dependent velocity u t a translational acceleration term appears in the velocity pressure formulation of navier stokes equations 1 u t u u d u d t p ρ ν 2 u 2 u 0 where u u v is the velocity under the non inertial frame ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluids p is the pressure ρ is the density of the fluids and t is the time the vorticity in the non inertial frame of reference is the same as that under the inertial frame since the background flow u is homogeneous in space 3 ω v x u y it can be shown that by absorbing the transnational acceleration term into the pressure term as a potential in eq 1 the curl operation on this equation will result in a vorticity transport equation that takes the same form as the one in the inertial frame of reference 4 ω t u ω ν 2 ω with the initial and boundary conditions 5 u t 0 u u u b on body surface u u at infinity where u b is the velocity of the wall surface since a stationary 2 d cylinder is studied in this work u b 0 therefore the frame motion only enters into the solution of the problem through the initial and boundary conditions in 2 d the velocity u can be represented by the gradient of stream function ψ as 6 u ψ y ψ x the solving of the above system can be divided into a kinetic procedure and a kinematic procedure wu and thompson 1973 white 1976 the kinetic process convects and diffuses the vorticity produced from the wall surfaces in the flow domain by the vorticity equation 4 the kinematic process described by eqs 2 and 3 calculates the velocity or stream function corresponding to a given vorticity distribution also one needs to account for appropriate boundary conditions for both steps actually a closed form integral expression that recovers the velocity field from a known vorticity field can be found thompson 1971 the velocity field is sequentially used to determine the vorticity boundary conditions on the wall through a vorticity creation scheme in the present method the stream function is adopted instead of the velocity the flowchart of general solving procedures is shown in fig 1 2 2 vorticity transport equation while solving the vorticity equation 4 the velocity u is treated explicitly since the flow field is uniquely determined for a given vorticity distribution according to the helmholtz velocity decomposition eq 4 is solved by using the cell centered fvm considering the configuration of a control cell surrounded by 4 edges from the structural mesh as shown in fig 2 and applying the gauss theorem to the conservative form of eq 4 over the control cell we have the discretized vorticity equation as 7 a ω t f 1 4 m f ω f ν f 1 4 ω n f δ l f where δ l f indicates the edge length m f a f u n d l is the mass flux across a cell edge a is the area of the control cell a is the boundary enclosing the cell and n is the unit normal vector of the boundary pointing outwards under the fvm discretization boundary conditions are needed for eq 7 a the far field boundary condition is ω 0 b the out flow boundary condition is ω n 0 c the wall boundary condition is ω n 0 the homogeneous neumann boundary condition is recommended at all the boundaries except for the far field which is exhaustively reasoned by cottet et al 2000 the mass flux m can be calculated by knowing the stream functions ψ at both ends of the cell edge as given by eq 8 notice that the direction of the edge is determined by the right hand rule the most substantial benefit of using eq 8 is that the net mass flux out of a control cell is strictly 0 since the evaluation is exact 8 m ψ end ψ start in the current study the alternating directional implicit adi scheme proposed by peaceman and rachford 1955 is used to march the vorticity from the current time step t to the next time step t δ t where δ t is the time step size eq 7 is then split into two sweeps and expressed as 9 ω t δ t 2 1 δ t 2 c 1 d 1 1 1 δ t 2 c 2 d 2 ω t ω t δ t 1 δ t 2 c 2 d 2 1 1 δ t 2 c 1 d 1 ω t δ t 2 where c 1 2 and d 1 2 are the convective and diffusive coefficients in two directions the interpolations of convective terms are evaluated by a convection limiter which will be described thoroughly in section 2 3 the diffusive terms are calculated by a linear interpolation scheme since the grids used in this application are orthogonal 2 3 convection limiter the convection limiter is a hybrid algorithm combined the first order upwind scheme with the quick scheme the quick scheme was originally introduced by leonard 1979 and the formulation for non uniform grids was derived by ferziger and peric 2012 even though the quick scheme is third order in space and extremely conservative it encounters considerable difficulties in interpolating values involving sharp gradient changes especially in case of vorticity simulations the vortical flow regions are enclosed by distinct borders and the quick scheme would give nonphysical results near the borders where the impulsive gradient variations exist hence a convection limiter is implemented in the present method the first order upwind scheme is employed to keep the results monotone for large gradients the quick scheme is used to maintain the order of accuracy for small and mild gradients the quick scheme corrected by the convection limiter f θ woodfield et al 2004 in terms of variable ξ reads 10 ξ e ξ u f θ l x e x u l x e x u u l x d x u l x d x u u ξ d ξ u l x e x u l x e x d l x u x u u l x d x u u ξ u ξ u u where e u u u and d represent the current edge the far upwind cell the near upwind cell and the downwind cell respectively the function l x 1 x 2 calculates the distance between two locations x 1 and x 2 θ is a non dimensionalized variable that evaluates the gradient changes 11 θ ξ u min ξ u u ξ d ξ u u ξ d the convection limiter f θ is 12 f θ 0 θ 0 θ δ 0 θ δ 1 δ θ 1 δ 1 θ δ 1 δ θ 1 0 1 where δ represents the length of the hybrid region as shown in fig 3 δ should be wisely chosen to strike a good balance between less numerical dissipation and lower risks of failures in the present study δ is set to be 0 2 which is also recommended by woodfield et al 2004 from a series of numerical tests in addition the quick scheme will conflict with the adi solver therefore the high order terms in eq 10 are put into the rhs of the algebraic system which is subsequently solved by using the deferred correction technique richardson and gaunt 1927 2 4 stream function calculation the velocity field and the vorticity field are related through the stream function ψ for a given vorticity field the stream functions at the nodes of the control cells should be retrieved in order to march equation 7 to the next time step considering the relation between u and ψ in eq 6 eq 3 becomes 13 2 ψ ω eq 13 is solved by using green s function in 2 d thompson 1971 wu and thompson 1973 14 ψ x c ϒ ω x ln x c x 2 π d υ ψ i n here x c is the location where ψ is evaluated and the dummy variable x runs through the integral domain ϒ covering all the vortical flow regions ψ i n y u 1 x u 2 is the stream function of the background flow u u 1 u 2 supposing that the vorticity is constant within every control cell eq 14 is split into the numerical summation of the influence of all cells where the vorticity exists an analytical solution of eq 14 for a control cell with uniform vorticity distribution is derived in appendix applying eq 14 throughout the domain is relatively expensive the computational complexity is o n 2 for n cells in the vortical regions however the computation effort is nevertheless under control in 2 d applications especially with proper parallelization as explained in section 5 to achieve better performance on a single core processor several fast algorithms can be utilized such as the fast multipole method fmm of o n log n by lindsay and krasny 2001 and the fmm of o n by greengard and rokhlin 1987 alternatively certain numerical methods including the fvm the fdm or the finite element method fem for elliptic partial differential equations can be adopted to solve the poisson equation 13 but one has to treat the non orthogonality of the grids in this case 2 5 vorticity creation on the wall the convection and diffusion of vorticity are described by eq 4 and meanwhile the vorticity generated from the wall surface should also be included in the flow the vorticity creation can be modeled as a surface vorticity distribution or a vortex sheet on the wall chorin 1978 the strength of the vortex sheet is evaluated by enforcing the non penetrating and no slip boundary conditions of the velocity field determined by a known vorticity field koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 assuming at time step t the correct velocity field u t advances the vorticity from the current time step ω t to the next time step ω ˆ t δ t however ω ˆ t δ t will induce a velocity field that has normal components u ˆ n t δ t ψ ˆ t δ t s and tangential components u ˆ s t δ t ψ ˆ t δ t n on the wall boundaries where n and s are defined in fig 4 note that the velocity u ˆ t δ t includes the contribution of both the vorticity and the background flow in order to assure the non penetrating boundary condition alaplace s equation for the potential ϕ is solved cottet et al 2000 15 2 ϕ 0 with the kinematic boundary condition on the wall surface 16 ϕ n u ˆ n t δ t ψ ˆ t δ t s in the present method eq 15 is transformed into an integral form by using green s second identity in 2 d kellogg 1953 and solved based on the boundary element method bem banerjee and butterfield 1981 to obtain the potential ϕ on the wall the gradient of ϕ together with the tangential velocity u ˆ s t δ t on the wall is converted into the surface vorticity distribution γ 17 γ ϕ s ψ ˆ t δ t n the surface vorticity γ shares the same dimension with the velocity m s actually γ is defined as the vortex sheet strength ω h as the height of the sheet h 0 notably the potential ϕ only contributes to the surface vorticity γ on the wall and does not affect the other parts of the domain the created surface vorticity γ is successively released into the flow field which acts as implementing the no slip boundary condition every point on the wall can release the created vorticity ω γ from the body surface koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 established a relation between the surface vorticity γ and the normal vorticity flux ω γ n across the wall 18 ν ω γ n γ δ t the surface vorticity γ enters the flow domain by a diffusion equation 19 with the neumann type boundary condition 18 on the wall the homogeneous far field dirichlet boundary condition ω γ t δ t 0 and the homogeneous initial condition ω γ t 0 19 ω γ t ν 2 ω γ eq 19 is numerically solved by using the fvm in the exact same way of solving equation 4 eventually the vorticity at time step t δ t reads 20 ω t δ t ω ˆ t δ t ω γ t δ t 2 6 surface pressure and sheer stress calculation in the viscous flow the non penetrating and no slip boundary conditions require zero velocity on the fixed body surface so the unsteady term and the convective term in the momentum equation disappear on the body surface considering a local coordinate system on the surface of body s n as shown in fig 4 in which s represents the unit vector tangential to the wall and n is the unit vector normal to the wall the momentum equation is further simplified to 21 p s μ ω n where p represents the pressure and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluids in eq 21 ω n is already known from the vorticity creation process and p s describes how the pressure field changes on the body surface therefore once the pressure at an arbitrary point is given the pressure along the body surface can be evaluated according to eq 21 in the current work the pressure at the upstream stagnation point is chosen to be the reference and calculated using bernoulli s equation which is ρ u 2 2 the shear stress τ on the body surface is determined by the changing rate of tangential velocity u s in the normal direction recalling the vorticity defined by eq 3 in 2 d since the normal velocity u n is strictly zero on the body surface it can be shown that the surface shear stress is directly related to the vorticity on the wall 22 τ μ ω the total external force exerting on the body f f d f l is the summation of pressure force f p and friction force f τ which are calculated by integrating the pressure and the shear stress along the body surface s b respectively 23 f f p f τ s b p n d l s b τ s d l where f l is the lift and f d is the drag they are the components of f in the global cartesian coordinate system the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d are non dimensionalized by ρ u 2 r 3 numerical results of impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder the proposed method is applied to the impulsively started flow initialized as the inviscid flow with a slip boundary condition on the wall past a circular cylinder to validate its accuracy and robustness in the inertial frame of reference this type of problem is unanimously believed to be the standard benchmark test for unsteady separated flow and has been widely investigated in this study the cylinder with a diameter of d locates at the origin x d y d 0 0 of the global coordinate system and the uniform inflow comes in the x direction a circular computational domain with a radius of 14 5 d is used for the simulations as shown in fig 5 the grid grows uniformly in the circumferential direction s and exponentially in the normal direction n although such a large computational domain is overkill for the vorticity methods as indicated by anderson and reider 1996 remarkably the calculations are only conducted in a small fraction of the grids where the vorticity is non zero the reynolds number r e is defined as 24 r e 2 u r ν where r d 2 is the radius of the cylinder u is the inflow velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluids the strouhal number s t is defined as 25 s t 2 f i r u 2 r u t i where f i and t i represent the frequency and period of the vortex shedding respectively the non dimensional time t is defined as 26 t t u r in this section the flow development at early flow times during which the wake exhibits rather complex shedding structures for r e 550 1000 3000 and 9500 along with the late stage vortex shedding phase for r e 100 and 200 are presented the descriptions of wake structures in the very early phase are provided for only half of the wake because the flow is symmetric with respect to the flow axis which is also the x axis defined in fig 4 before the periodic vortex shedding begins for these reynolds numbers bouard and coutanceau 1980 3 1 grid and time step size dependence study a grid dependence study is conducted for the impulsively started cylinder at reynolds number r e 3000 with various grid resolutions circumferential direction normal direction three levels of grid resolution are considered including the coarse grid 100 80 the medium grid 200 135 and the fine grid 300 190 the surface pressure coefficient distributions at t 2 0 given in fig 6 a verify that the solutions become independent on grids as the resolution increases also the results are found to be in line with those calculated by anderson and reider 1996 additionally the influence of time step size on the results is investigated the simulations are performed in the medium grid with a time step size δ t 1 0 1 0 2 2 0 1 0 3 and 4 0 1 0 4 respectively it is obvious that the surface pressure coefficient distributions are not dependent on the time step size if δ t is larger than 2 0 1 0 3 as shown in fig 6 b during the simulations the absolute total circulation is limited within 1 0 1 0 9 and the absolute total net mass flux is controlled under 1 0 1 0 14 3 2 impulsively started process for r e 550 1000 3000 and 9500 in this part the initial stages of the impulsively started flow past a cylinder are studied the results from the present method are compared with other numerical results koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 anderson and reider 1996 subramaniam 1997 qian and vezza 2001 and experimental data bouard and coutanceau 1980 koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and subramaniam 1997 studied the early stage growth of wake behind the cylinder using the mesh free discrete vortex methods similar studies were carried out by anderson and reider 1996 who solved the n s equations using the finite difference schemes of both second order and fourth order qian and vezza 2001 simulated not only the start but also the longtime evolution of the flow past a cylinder based on the vorticity velocity formulation of the n s equations bouard and coutanceau 1980 meticulously designed the experiments to achieve the abrupt initiation of the impulsively started cylinder and investigated the wake and separations behind the cylinder by visualizations at reynolds numbers ranging from 40 to 1 0 4 3 2 1 r e 550 firstly the impulsively started flow at r e 550 is simulated using the proposed method the grid with a number of elements 200 135 and the first layer grid size in the normal direction h 0 d 0 001 is utilized for the calculation the time step size to march the flow in time is δ t 0 002 fig 7 compares the instantaneous streamlines produced by the present method with the visualized flow patterns obtained from the experiments of bouard and coutanceau 1980 at t 5 0 after the flow starts from rest vorticity is created from the body surface and shed into the domain and a recirculating region is formed by multiple vortical structures in the wake particularly in this case a secondary vortex bounded by a primary vortex is observed in fig 7 the radial velocity distributions along the rear centerline of the cylinder are compared with those computed by subramaniam 1997 qian and vezza 2001 and dupuis et al 2008 at flow times t 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 which are illustrated graphically in fig 8 the velocity is negative within the recirculating zone due to the reversed flow and reaches a minimum value at a specific location the intercepts where the velocity profiles cross the x axis u u 0 other than the origin also reveal the evolution in time of the wake length the wake length as well as the minimum velocity and its location can all be used to characterize the wake configuration and the comparisons show good agreement in addition the development in time of drag coefficients calculated by the present method closely matches the predictions of both koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and qian and vezza 2001 as given in fig 9 3 2 2 r e 1000 also the flow at r e 1000 is studied in this case the grid with a resolution 200 135 and h 0 d 0 001 is generated for the simulation the time step size is δ t 0 002 the chronological development of the vorticity in the wake is given in fig 10 as equal value contours demonstrating that the present method well captures the phenomena α bouard and coutanceau 1980 it is seen in particular that a primary vortex is generated behind the cylinder in half of the recirculating region immediately after the flow starts and grows quickly with time later a secondary vortex begins to develop at t 2 0 due to the separation of the primary vortex from a thin layer into a strong vortex that rotates in the opposite direction of and is enclosed by the primary vortex the vorticity contours from the current method are in good agreement with those provided by qian and vezza 2001 anderson and reider 1996 and koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 the evolution of vortices behind the cylinder is directly manifested in the variation of surface vorticity fig 11 shows the surface vorticity distributions compared with those from qian and vezza 2001 at flow times t 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 which also show good agreement the changes in the strength of the primary and secondary vortices in time are clearly observed in fig 11 the readers may notice from the curves that a tertiary vortex hardly identified from the vorticity contours emerges at later times this vortex is more distinctly observable for higher reynolds numbers additionally the present drag coefficients are almost the same as the results offered by koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and qian and vezza 2001 as shown in fig 12 actually the variation in drag history is a result of the interactions between the primary and secondary vortices in the beginning the drag continuously drops due to the growth of primary vortex after the primary vortex starts to separate from the cylinder the formation and development of the secondary vortex raise the drag to a maximum value then further separations of the primary vortex and the decay of the secondary vortex gradually reduce the drag 3 2 3 r e 3000 further the reynolds number is increased to be r e 3000 in this test the grid with 200 135 cells and h 0 d 0 001 is used together with a time step size δ t 0 002 to advance in time the wake evolution with time is described in equal value contours of vorticity in fig 13 at a higher reynolds number the primary vortex generates a larger adverse pressure gradient which induces a stronger secondary vortex that subsequently creates a distinguished tertiary vortex the tertiary vortex stops the secondary vortex from going through the primary one these three vortical structures appear in a temporal and logical order the primary vortex is firstly formed and dominates the flow and the secondary vortex is induced as the primary vortex begins to isolate from the cylinder similarly the development and separation of the secondary vortex create the tertiary vortex this remarkable phenomenon has also been detected by koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 anderson and reider 1996 and qian and vezza 2001 which can be reliable sources for the examinations of the current results the streamlines at t 5 are compared with the experimental observations by bouard and coutanceau 1980 in fig 14 which also offers essential insights into the interactions between the primary vortex the secondary vortex and the tertiary vortex in fact the vortices in the wake significantly affect the surface vorticity in fig 15 the surface vorticity distributions are presented along with the results from qian and vezza 2001 at flow times t 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 strong spatial fluctuations in the surface vorticity which also exposes the changes of the vortex strength are observed the secondary vortex appears at about t 2 0 and its strength keeps increasing as the secondary vortex grows and attempts to penetrate the primary vortex the strength of the primary one decreases due to the diffusion and weakened feeding later at t 3 0 another vortex is generated that fights against the secondary vortex from cutting off the feeding of the primary vortex the interactions between the secondary and tertiary vortices increase the strength of both of them for a short period of time and the primary vortex gains strength again due to the reinforced feeding eventually the strength of all three vortices decays slowly through diffusion as the wake tends to be steady before the vortex shedding is initiated fig 16 shows the comparisons of radial velocity distributions along the rear flow axis behind the cylinder with those computed by subramaniam 1997 and qian and vezza 2001 at flow times t 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 in general the results are almost the same 3 2 4 r e 9500 the impulsively started flow at r e 9500 is critical for the numerical methods because of the complex wake structures and separation details for this simulation the grid with a number of 300 200 cells and h 0 d 0 0005 is used in conjunction with a time step size δ t 0 002 fig 17 displays how the wake advances in time in terms of equi vorticity contours and streamlines and also gives the experimental results from bouard and coutanceau 1980 as validations of the present work the phenomenon β is evidently seen during the development of flow bouard and coutanceau 1980 in the beginning a thin layer of vortex is formed and soon grows to be the primary vortex after a small lapse of time this strong primary vortex splits the wake into 2 regions a pair of secondary counter rotating vortices appears near the front separation point and the tertiary vortex separates from the primary one in the vicinity of the rear reattachment point the contours from a high resolution simulation are accessible in the publication of koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 the comparisons with lower reynolds numbers confirm that the decrease in viscosity results in the growth of small scale structures in the wake as the reynolds number increases the same trend can also be observed from the rising oscillations of surface vorticity the surface vorticity variations with time as computed by the current method koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and qian and vezza 2001 are shown in fig 18 at flow times t 0 4 1 0 1 2 1 8 and 2 0 the decrease in viscosity at higher reynolds numbers leads to weaker diffusion as a result the wake tends to be unstable and vulnerable to perturbations compared with the previous cases the strength of the inner secondary vortex is much larger and increases quickly as the vortex grows under thin diffusion this strong secondary vortex penetrates and splits the primary vortex rapidly since the viscosity is no longer effective enough to hold the vortices together the primary vortex then starts to absorb the tertiary vortex and detach from the cylinder additionally the radial velocity distributions along the rear centerline of the cylinder are compared with the results obtained by subramaniam 1997 and qian and vezza 2001 at flow times t 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 the corresponding graphic representations are given in fig 19 3 3 vortex shedding in longtime simulation for r e 100 and 200 in this part the longtime evolution of impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder at r e 100 and 200 is presented to assess the present method in capturing the periodic vortex shedding the mesh with 200 210 elements and the first layer grid size in the normal direction h 0 d 0 001 is adopted with a time step size δ t 0 002 the radius of the computational domain is increased to be 17 0 d the vortex shedding phase will not be automatically activated by the numerical errors even when t approaches 200 because of the highly conservative scheme therefore the vortex shedding is triggered manually by a perturbation at a relatively early time the impulsively started flow past a cylinder at r e 100 and r e 200 is simulated using the present method respectively the evolution of lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d eventually develops into steady sinusoidal fluctuations due to the periodic vortex shedding during the longtime simulation as plotted in fig 20 the lift coefficient drag coefficient and strouhal number predicted by the current method during the established shedding phase are compared with the results of other latest studies as shown in table 1 the present results agree well with them quantitatively the amplitude of lift drag coefficient and the strouhal number at r e 200 are larger than those at r e 100 during the vortex shedding phase which is caused by the drop of viscosity fig 21 displays a snapshot of the alternating vortices shed behind the cylinder in terms of vorticity contours a much shorter distance between two neighboring vortices is observed at r e 200 than that at r e 100 also the vortices are dissipated much faster by the larger viscosity at r e 100 4 numerical results of oscillatory flow past a circular cylinder the inline oscillatory flow past a stationary circular cylinder is simulated to show the capability and accuracy of the proposed method under the non inertial frame in translation this problem is of diverse interests to both hydrodynamic and structural academia blevins 1977 in addition the accurate predictions of time dependent loads on structures matter enormously in the civil and offshore industry naudascher and rockwell 2012 similar to the unidirectional flow the cylinder with a diameter of d is fixed at the origin x d y d 0 0 of the global coordinate system the circular computational domain has a radius of 10 0 d and the flow oscillates along the x direction with a sinusoidal velocity 27 u u o cos 2 π f o t where u o is the maximum velocity of the oscillatory inflow and f o is the frequency of the velocity oscillation the oscillatory flow is characterized by the keulegan carpenter number k c and the reynolds number r e the reynolds number of the oscillatory flow is defined as 28 r e u o d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluids the keulegan carpenter number is defined as 29 k c u o t o d where t o 1 f o is the period of the oscillatory flow further the ratio of r e to k c gives the frequency parameter or stokes number β which is expressed as 30 β r e k c d 2 ν t o 2 d oscillatory flow past a circular cylinder only exists at low k c and r e numbers tatsuno and bearman 1990 within the scope of current work the oscillatory flow at r e 100 k c 5 is firstly studied in this section to validate the proposed method in the non inertial translating frame of reference the present results are checked against other numerical schemes and experimental visualizations dütsch et al 1998 numerically reproduced three regimes found by tatsuno and bearman 1990 in 2 d and in particular provided experimental measurements as validations guilmineau and queutey 2002 carried out similar studies on a 2 d circular cylinder subject to inline oscillations with extensions to cross flow oscillations an et al 2011 conducted direct numerical simulations to investigate the honji vortices honji 1981 in oscillatory flow past a 3 d circular cylinder and discovered that the instabilities are directly related to β upon validations the results of oscillatory flow at r e 200 k c 1 2 and 4 are further presented to investigate the influence of k c number on the inline forces exerting on the cylinder the k c and r e numbers used here are small such that the flow is symmetric and subcritical and laminar boundary layers can be established sarpkaya 1986 4 1 r e 100 and k c 5 in this case the grid with a resolution 300 150 and h 0 d 0 001 is built for the simulation the time step size is δ t 0 002 according to the classifications of tatsuno and bearman 1990 a combination of k c 5 and r e 100 falls into the category of regime a of which the flow is 2 d and symmetric with respect to the x axis and separations occur periodically fig 22 displays the development of vorticity in half a cycle when the cylinder begins to move in the positive x direction from its maximum negative location at first two thin layers of vorticity ① partially bounded by a pair of vortices ② and a pair of fully detached vortices ③ are observed the motion of the cylinder causes the growth of vortices ① from thin layers into a pair of dominant vortices accompanied by the separation of vortices ② which gradually fade together with vortices ③ due to diffusion eventually the feeding links of vortices ① are cut off by the formation of two new thin layers of vorticity ④ on the wall surface fig 23 shows the comparisons of velocity profiles at different locations and phase angles 2 π f o t between the current solutions and the experimental results of dütsch et al 1998 notably the measurements by dütsch et al 1998 were made with respect to the fluids on the contrary the current numerical simulations adopted a cylinder fixed global coordinate system therefore coordinates transformations were conducted to produce reasonable comparisons as is seen in fig 23 the results share the same trend in general but still exhibit some visual discrepancies to further demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method the velocity profiles are compared with the numerical results predicted by dütsch et al 1998 guilmineau and queutey 2002 as well as an et al 2011 in fig 24 which shows good agreement in the simulations of dütsch et al 1998 and guilmineau and queutey 2002 the cylinder is forced to oscillate in the quiescent flow in contrast the flow field alternates around the fixed cylinder in the present method which provides a different perspective to view the same problem under the non inertial frame it is noteworthy to point out that similar deviations in velocity profiles also exist between the experimental data of dütsch et al 1998 and the numerical results of the mentioned three studies dütsch et al 1998 guilmineau and queutey 2002 an et al 2011 finally the variations of inline force coefficients non dimensionalized by ρ u o 2 r in time are reported in fig 25 4 2 r e 200 and k c 1 2 4 in this part the grid and time step size are the same as the previous case the reynolds number is raised to be 200 the flow at a k c number of 1 2 and 4 is simulated using the current method respectively the vorticity contours are shown in fig 26 at a phase angle of 180 for k c 1 2 and 4 it is seen that the vorticity is attached to the cylinder at lower k c numbers but separations will occur for the flow at larger k c numbers the developments of inline force coefficients non dimensionalized by ρ u o 2 r in time are displayed in fig 27 similar to the case at r e 100 and k c 5 the pressure part contributes much more to the total force than the friction part does for all k c numbers presented in this work the authors also notice a drop in the total force mostly resulting from the reduction of pressure force when the k c number increases the reason for this decline is that a higher k c number means a larger period of the oscillation and a lower acceleration which generates a milder adverse pressure gradient on the down stream side of the cylinder a closer look at the friction force is given in fig 28 demonstrating the decrease of friction force as the k c number rises which shares the same trend of how the pressure force changes with the k c number according to eq 22 the friction force is proportional to the intensity of vorticity also the velocity gradient on the wall the vorticity has enough time to convect away and detach from the cylinder for higher k c numbers while in contrast the vorticity is largely confined to the regions near the cylinder for lower k c numbers as shown in fig 26 therefore the flow at smaller k c numbers is characterized with larger vorticity magnitude in the vicinity of the cylinder resulting in bigger friction force 5 computational efficiency and parallelization to show the efficiency of the proposed vorticity method an analysis of the computational complexity is conducted in the simulation of an impulsively started cylinder at r e 3000 and r e 200 the cells actively involved in the calculations are defined as the occupied cells whose vorticity magnitude is larger than a predefined value 10 6 in this study firstly at r e 3000 the number of occupied cells used in the present method is compared in particular with those of koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 and kevlahan and vasilyev 2005 who put forward a wavelet method to calculate the flow around a cylinder at flow time t 6 0 to resolve the fine wake comprised of several eddies 3 0 1 0 5 particles are employed by koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 in the discrete vortex method as opposed to only 1 3 1 0 4 which is about 23 times smaller occupied cells utilized in the current method in the work of kevlahan and vasilyev 2005 4 3 1 0 4 which is 3 3 times larger than the number of occupied cells in the present method wavelets are necessary to capture the wake structures however the computational cost of one wavelet element over a vorticity cell is hard to quantify as indicated by kevlahan and vasilyev 2005 additionally the size of the computational domain and the number of cells in the grid are compared between the current method and the n s methods as shown in table 2 at a reynolds number around 200 as is seen the present method has a much smaller computational domain and a less number of cells the authors also remark that the actual number of occupied cells involved in the computations is only a small fraction of the total number it therefore is obvious that the present method is more efficient compared with the other methods in terms of computational complexity the coarse grid with much fewer cells produces comparably fine results of the other methods in order to further improve the computational efficiency the present numerical scheme is paralleled the most time consuming part which turns out to be the stream function calculations and takes 99 of the total time cost is located by profiling since the data of spatially connected cells is not necessarily stored in the memory continuously the vectorization which is the vector calculation of a processor does not function effectively in case of random memory access however the evaluations of eq 14 are perfect for parallel computing in which independent calculations are performed by multiple computer processors simultaneously because the computations of inductions using eq 14 are not dependent on each other the work can be distributed to available processors and conducted at the same time the speed up of parallelization in terms of strong scaling amdahl 1967 and the number of processors used exhibit an almost ideally linear relationship in fig 29 in which the speed up is defined as t 1 t n where t n is the time cost using n processors and t 1 is the time cost using 1 processor 6 conclusions and future work a conservative vorticity method that solves the vorticity stream function formulation of navier stokes equations in the eulerian coordinates is proposed to simulate the incompressible unsteady viscous flow past bluff bodies in 2 d the numerical scheme is based on the modified integro differential technique which permits the simulation to be limited to only the regions with non zero vorticity the computation is then split into two consecutive steps that are the solving of vorticity transport equation using the cell centered fvm and the recovery of stream functions using an analytical solution the exact evaluations of mass flux from the explicitly calculated stream functions further secure the continuity of velocity field to ensure the accuracy and monotonicity of vorticity interpolations a convection limiter coupling the first order upwind scheme and the quick scheme is implemented in addition a vorticity creation scheme effectively resolving the impulsive initiation and boundary layer distribution is employed to determine the amount of vorticity released from the wall by imposing the boundary conditions on the body surface the conservative fvm and quick scheme and the exact evaluations of stream functions and convective flux together construct a numerical scheme that ensures the conservation of circulation and mass the proposed vorticity method has been validated by simulating the impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder at reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 9500 in the inertial frame of reference and the oscillatory flow around a circular cylinder at r e 100 k c 5 as well as r e 200 k c 1 2 4 in the non inertial translational frame of reference the present results coincide well with those from other established numerical and experimental benchmark tests demonstrating that the current method produces high quality results for both early stage evolution and longtime vortex shedding phase of the flow past a circular cylinder even in comparatively coarse grids the current method can simulate 2 d laminar flow past solid bodies in both inertial and non inertial translational frame of reference in an efficient way even though only the results of the flow past a circular cylinder are shown in this work the method can be applied to lifting or bluff bodies of arbitrary shapes the method can also handle turbulent flow past a 2 d hydrofoil yao and kinnas 2019 with appropriate modifications or cavitating flow xing et al 2018 also this method is being extended to 3 d and a preliminary study about the flow past a 3 d hydrofoil has been shown by wu and kinnas 2019 due to the advantage of promising efficiency this method has the potential for simulating the flow around 3 d long cylinders such as the risers connecting a subsea oil well to an offshore platform acknowledgments support for

22407,modelling of storm surge numerically has always been strenuous as it is associated with various influencing factors the major governing component being the wind forcing or the wind stress that signifies the computational accuracy of simulated surge and wave parameters the present study is aimed at analysing the most reliable wind drag evaluation method for real time predictions of storm surge in an attempt to examine the same two tropical cyclones thane and vardah eventuated in the northern indian ocean were modelled four most widely used linear empirical and quadratic relations along with the enhanced wave boundary layer model wblm were executed for the estimations of wind drag coefficient the surge was subsequently simulated using the coupled hydrodynamic circulation and wave model adcirc and swan respectively individually for each of the above wind stress methods to obtain the corresponding water levels and wave features the modelled values were further validated with the observed water level and wave data it was quite intuitively observed that wblm outperformed i e significantly correlated with the observed values its linear counterparts since the former pragmatically includes the effects of air sea interface at high wind speeds in the model however due to insufficiency of the observed parameters water levels obtained at locations of maximum wind speeds could not be satisfactorily validated the wblm based computation of significant wave heights in deep as well as shallow water nevertheless enabled efficient and reasonably reliable estimations of the peak incidents along with relative wave directions and energy densities although this study essentially includes cyclonic wind velocities it was identified that with given wind field that includes the pre existing wind wave climate in the relevant domain i e before the cyclone genesis the modelled estimates could be more precise keywords storm surge storm wave wind drag coefficient wave boundary layer model adcirc swan bay of bengal 1 introduction cyclonic storms have proved catastrophic in multiple occurrences thereby mandating immediate and dedicated study for precise real time predictions it has been observed that five out of the seven saarc nations except nepal and bhutan that are surrounded by land mass are greatly affected due to tropical cyclones tidal waves and their augmented effects the boundless coastline of india 7500 km surrounded by the two major basins of the northern indian ocean bay of bengal on the east and arabian sea on the west has historically always been prone to severe cyclonic storm surge events in particular the bay of bengal bob basin has emanated the most devastating ones that has been cataclysmic in varying degrees components like the shallow shores of the bob the low and flat coastal terrain of india and bangladesh and the funnel shaped coastline combination tend to produce such intensive surge events almost 14 of the population of india have their habitats along the coastal stretches and are highly vulnerable to such extreme sea level events in the recorded history of such events the surge 10 m caused by cyclone bhola in the year 1970 on the coasts of bangladesh madsen and jakobsen 2004 is considered the most intensive one a super cyclonic storm scs that made its landfall in the odisha coast in 1999 is observed to be the highest of about 7 5 m surge causing event in context of indian scenario dube et al 2000 thus it necessitates a quantitative understanding of these phenomena which could consequently aid the prediction such that the precautionary actions could be adopted on time although quantifying a natural phenomenon includes numerous complicated factors per se several models have been developed to simulate and predict a storm s behaviour storm surge modelling and prevising of such events therefore need to be essentiated in order to safe guard the lives and interest of the nation numerically modelling storm surge has always been considered an exacting task and the research community has constantly been working towards better and more precise solutions over the past few decades such modelling requires various input parameters like wind velocity central pressure of the cyclone local bathymetry tidal input and wave stress gradients in case when coupled with a wave model these input parameters are collected and generated through various data sources and models which is then fed to the surge model to simulate the vertical elevation of surge and inundation levels a detailed approach on such studies towards indian coastal regions are reported by murty et al 1986 dube et al 1997 2009 it is a familiar fact that the ocean currents and waves are steered through the momentum fluxes across air sea interface to evaluate this momentum flux at the air sea interface at high wind speeds is still an exhausting way to accomplish through numerical methods a simplified approach to identifying this transfer of momentum is through shear stress which is also known as the wind stress and is expressed as 1 τ ρ a u 2 ρ a c d u 10 2 where ρ a is the density of air u is the shear velocity u 10 is the horizontal wind speed at an height of 10 m above the sea surface and cd is the wind drag coefficient several researchers have stated about the empirical computation of the wind drag coefficient as a function of wind speed nevertheless this approach might not be suitable for extreme events like cyclonic surge estimation as the wind speed exceeds 35 m s quite frequently the empirical relations proposed by garratt 1977 large and pond 1981 and wu 1982 are the most extensively used ones the wind drag coefficient cd is also used to calculate the boundary layer parameters as reported through many contemporary models like sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes slosh e g jelesnianski et al 1992 phan et al 2013 advanced circulation multidimensional hydrodynamic model adcirc e g westerink and luettich 1991 dietrich et al 2011 bhaskaran et al 2014 finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom e g huang et al 2010 zheng et al 2013 in terms of application these empirical methods were usually presumed to be applied for high wind conditions whereas the recent studies by powell et al 2003 and holthuijsen et al 2012 stated that it was inappropriate the wind drag coefficient attains a levelled off nature and rather reduces at very high winds crossing 35 40 m s hence the uncertainties revolving around this wind drag coefficient has not been completely perceived the phenomenon of wind drag reduction at high winds has reportedly makin and kudryavtsev 2002 donelan et al 2004 kudryavtsev 2006 been ascribed to the change in momentum transfer due to the uninterrupted breaking of waves however some other studies andreas 2004 kudryavtsev and makin 2011 etc assert that it is due to the sea spray effect on the boundary layer that was consequently generated due to the same phenomenon i e uninterrupted breaking of waves therefore the preferable alternative is to cap the wind drag on a threshold value or even assume a law for decreasing coefficients bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2010 zijlema et al 2012 it is hence noteworthy to mention that the study performed by moon et al 2009 with the wblm coupled with wind and surge models generated better results with realistic scenario further the development of wblm through the inclusion of sea spray effect chen and yu 2016 2017 has brought in a pragmatic way of representing the wind drag coefficient for extreme wind conditions 35 m s the recent enhanced wblm chen and yu 2016 solves the dynamics through momentum and energy conservation equations of the wave boundary layer by accounting for more physical attributes involved in an air sea interaction process the total stress computed through the model is a constant and is conventionally said to be the sum of the wave induced stress and turbulent stress with the above mentioned way of including the sea spray effect the wblm is able to reproduce the decreasing tendency of the wind drag coefficient at very high wind speeds chen and yu 2016 the storm wave modelling study by chen and yu 2017 also substantiated the significance of the above mentioned enhanced model however its efficacy in assessing surge caused by a tropical cyclone is yet to be authenticated also chen and yu 2017 executed the enhanced wblm with the wave spectrum obtained from a standalone run of a wave model swave where the ambient flows between the tide surge and wave is neglected hence the current study directs its objective towards a comparative analysis of cyclonic surge modelling using the enhanced wblm with the two dimensional wave spectral input coming from a coupled circulation and wave model to account for the non linear interaction of tide surge and wave along with the enhanced wblm four other bulk formulae methods are also used for computing the wind drag coefficients followed by the storm surge and wave estimations for executing the same two cyclonic conditions namely cyclone thane 2011 and cyclone vardah 2016 as their tracks and landfall points are shown in fig 1 were considered both these cyclones have been characterised as very severe cyclonic storm vscs by the indian meteorological department imd as their wind speed exceeded 35 m s the present study employs the coupled hydrodynamic circulation model adcirc and the third generation wave model simulating waves nearshore swan e g booij et al 1999 to simulate the storm surge with the wind stress coefficients obtained from wblm the following sections give a brief discussion about both cyclone thane and cyclone vardah and the wind fields developed for the modelling the execution of the coupled model adcirc swan with the empirical methods and wblm the results obtained from numerical modelling were subsequently validated with the observed data tide gauge stations and buoys collected from the indian national centre for ocean information services incois further a comparative analysis was carried out in the evaluations of storm surge and storm wave parameters in correlation with the wind drag estimation methods 2 cyclone description 2 1 cyclone thane on the afternoon hours 1200 utc of 25th december 2011 imd reported a depression formed over the

optimizes the phase propagation properties atkinson et al 2004 dietrich et al 2012 various studies have been reported on the wetting and drying algorithms that adcirc uses to activate and deactivate elements based on the upturn and downturn of water depth blain et al 2002 dietrich et al 2004 2006 dick et al 2013 an element is considered to be wet only when all three vertices are wet if not then the corresponding element is taken as dry for that particular time step adcirc adopts implicit and explicit procedures to solve the gwce implicit scheme operates on the principle of jacobi conjugate gradient jcg method whereas the explicit scheme uses lumped diagonal mass matrix which solves at a faster rate than implicit dietrich et al 2004 2012 further once the water levels are obtained with respect to wetting and drying algorithms the momentum equations are solved to estimate the water currents 3 2 simulating waves nearshore swan model swan the third generation wave model used in this study solves the action balance equation through the method of gauss siedel algorithm to obtain the wave parameters the advantage of swan over the other computational models is that it can be applied over large domains to resolve the length and time scales of wind generated waves booij et al 1999 dietrich et al 2011 the gradual development of the wind generated waves can be described through the governing wave action balance equation 7 n t x c g u n c θ n θ c σ n σ s t o t σ where n x t σ θ is the wave action density spectrum change of wave action in time t σ is the relative frequency θ is

swan adopts an analog label to the gauss siedel iteration method zijlema 2010 due to the above mentioned key characterizations the circulation model adcirc and wave model swan are coupled to run on a parallel environment with the same unstructured triangular mesh for the computation of storm wave and surge characteristics in the fully coupled model adcirc first solves the shallow water equations to evaluate the wind velocities water levels and current velocities which is then passed on to swan to force its computations swan follows with the calculation of wave parameters and their corresponding radiation stresses on the following time step which is then fed as an input to adcirc the exchange of data between these two models on the parallel computing environment happens at each time step internally through local memory dietrich et al 2012 the coupling time interval between these two models are based on swan s time step for the current model simulations adcirc time step was considered to be 1 s as it is limited to courant number stabilization for its explicit method whereas swan s time step is prescribed as 1800 s owing to greater stability of the model 3 3 wind drag estimation methods the most important driving factor of numerical surge and wave modelling is the wind stress that is calculated by the corresponding models the wind stress which is directly proportional to its wind drag formulations can improve the accuracy of any surge or wave computation to a great extent when represented in a more realistic way in the present work five wind drag estimation methods namely the wblm wave boundary layer model and four most widely used empirical formulations developed by garratt 1977 large and pond 1981 wu 1982 and zijlema et al 2012 are considered for the investigation of wind stress computation and its corresponding storm surge estimation 3 3 1 garratt s method the bulk formulae proposed by garratt 1977 is the most widely used in terms of coupled adcirc and swan modelling bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011 2012 and it is given as 8 c d 10 3 0 75 0 067 u 10 u 10 41 m s 3 5 u 10 41 m s the c d calculated through equation 8 increases linearly with the increase of wind speed up to 41 m s and is capped by the numerical model adcirc at 0 0035 for high wind speeds beyond 41 m s to restrict unrealistic water level outputs 3 3 2 large and pond l p method the relation developed by large and pond 1981 can be written as 9 c d 10 3 1 2 u 10 11 m s 0 49 0 065 u 10 11 u 10 25 m s 2 115 u 10 25 m s this formulation is used in the finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom to simulate coupled surge and wave characteristics it is capped at a constant value beyond 25 m s wind speed the major difference between equations 8 and 9 is the upper limit at which c d is capped which in turn implies that there is still no solidarity in estimating the wind drag coefficient at high wind speeds 3 3 3 wu s method wu in 1982 formulated another empirical relation for estimating the wind drag and it is denoted as 10 c d 10 3 1 2875 u 10 7 5 m s 0 8 0 065 u 10 u 10 7 5 m s the linear slope in the formulation corresponding to the wind speed is identical in both wu and l p s methods whereas the constants used with respect to boundary layer characteristic differs the method is directly adopted in swave model qi et al 2009 which is the modified version of swan to couple with fvcom and other circulation models 3 3 4 zijlema s method zijlema et al 2012 had developed a quadratic method that fits a polynomial regression function using different sets of field data reported through various studies with a decreasing trend in the drag coefficient at high wind speeds the quadratic function is expressed as 11 c d 10 3 0 55 2 97 u 1 49 u 2 where u u 10 31 5 and u 10 is measured in terms of m s equation 11 gives a quadratic approach to estimate the wind drag coefficient at high wind speeds in particular during cyclonic conditions 31 5 m s which is 30 less than that of wu s method as shown in fig 2 however zijlema s method fails to give a positive value at wind speeds 68 m s and thus a minimal constraint has to be added 3 3 5 wave boundary layer model wblm the hindmost atmospheric layer over the ocean surface is termed to be the boundary layer which is significantly affected due to the wave motion under extreme wind conditions over the past few decades researchers have advocated to evaluate the wind stress that affects the wave motion through the correlation of momentum and energy conservation methods longuet higgins 1957 phillips 1985 janssen 1989 makin and kudryavtsev 1999 hara and belcher 2002 2004 moon et al 2004a 2004b the current study utilizes the enhanced wave boundary layer model developed by chen and yu 2016 where the wind shear stress τ is obtained by solving the conservation of mass and momentum equations for the atmospheric boundary layer 12 d d z u τ t o t d π w d z ρ a ε g ρ w ρ a α s k d s d z 0 13 τ t o t τ w z τ t z where τ w and τ t are the respective wave induced stress and turbulent stress occur locally u is the wind vector at the height z above the sea surface π w is the wave induced motion s vertical flux energy ε is the viscous dissipation rate α s is the reciprocal of turbulent schmidt number k is the turbulent eddy viscosity and s is the sea spray s volumetric concentration at height z above the sea surface chen and yu 2017 the wave induced stress is computed through the spectrum obtained from wave model through the bulk formulae it is to be noted that there are different formulations used by models to determine the high frequency spectrum fed into wblm donelan et al 2012 reichl et al 2014 fig 2 represents the comparison of wind drag estimations at various wind speeds for wblm and three other bulk formulae s used in this study the wind drag coefficients calculated through wblm shows a lowering trend instead of levelling off at very high wind speeds similar to the field measurements reported by powell et al 2003 as shown in fig 2 the limitation to the current modelling study is that it requires a pre run output of the wave spectrum from a numerical wave model which is computationally expensive and time consuming however it is negligible as the current day wave models can be coupled with wblm to execute the same 3 4 methodology the simulations of the present study as represented with the methodology flow diagram shown in fig 3 were carried out with the coupled adcirc circulation model and swan wave model on an unstructured triangular mesh whose two dimensional directional wave spectrum output is taken as an input forcing into the wblm to calculate the viscous stress τ v wave induced stress τ w roughness length and wind drag coefficient eventually the wind shear stress τ is computed and given back as an input to the coupled circulation and wave model to finally obtain the water levels and wave attributes for both the cyclonic conditions the model domain with bathymetric depth is shown in fig 4 which also illustrates the spatial extent that covers a significant part of the bob basin the domain was discretised with an unstructured triangular mesh of 463 752 elements and 233 802 nodes the bathymetric data from gebco general bathymetric chart of the oceans with 30 arc second data interval along with a high resolution nho national hydrographic office govt of india chart was used to define the water depth at all the nodal points mesh size of approximately 200 1000 m was discretised along the near shore regions while the deep ocean was discretised with 15 20 km resolution roughly as mentioned earlier the simulations were performed for two cyclonic scenarios namely thane and vardah which occurred in 2011 and 2016 respectively the simulation time frame for thane was from 25th december 2011 12 00 h to 30th december 12 00 h utc 5 days whereas for vardah it was executed from 6th december 2016 6 00 h to 13th december 2016 6 00 h utc 7 days the wind and pressure inputs given to the model is through the best track information obtained from the joint typhoon warning centre jtwc using which the wind and pressure fields are constructed through the generalised asymmetric holland model gahm an inbuilt module in adcirc for the simulations gahm interpolates wind speeds to all the nodal points of the domain through the information specified in the best track data by jtwc the bottom friction was assigned to be hybrid with parameters like cb hb θ and λ are set to 0 0026 1 10 and 1 3 respectively bhaskaran et al 2014 time step for the circulation model on both the cyclonic cases was considered to be 1 s which satisfies the stability cfl criteria westerink et al 1994 with respect to the domain resolution on the other hand swan s time step was posed to 1800 s and the coupling time interval was matched between adcirc and swan i e the exchange of wind velocities water levels and current velocities from adcirc and wave radiation stresses from swan will happen every 1800 s the computational space was discretised to 72 wave directional intervals with 5 increment and the wave frequency intervals are sorted out to 40 with a logarithmic increase across the range 0 0285 1 1726 energy changes due to white capping depth induced wave breaking and wave wave interaction were also activated all five wind stress evaluation methods garratt wu l p zijlema and wblm were implemented separately to calculate the surge and wave attributes 3 5 statistical error analysis to evaluate and compare the performance of the model generated results using various wind drag methods and the observed values statistical performance indicators such as the mean standard deviation root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r mean bias error mbe and mean relative error accuracy or percentage error pe were used the primary assumption made to compute these statistical parameters were that the observed measured data are error free while the generalised mean and standard deviation methods were calculated the rmse was computed using the following relationship 14 r m s e 1 n m o 2 where m represents the model predicted and o represents the observed values for a set of n rmse derives the line of best fit between the model predicted and the observed values umesh et al 2017 it is inferred that the lower value of rmse gives the best fit between model and observed data correlation coefficient is another often used method to establish the relation between the model and observed values it signifies the strength of the relationship between the model and observed parameters with a numerical value higher value if strong correlation persists and lower value to zero if they are independent it is defined as follows 15 r m m o o m m 2 o o 2 where m and o represents the mean of the model predicted and observed values respectively if the value of the correlation coefficient is close to one then it indicates that there is a high positive correlation between model and observed data with low random error however the systematic error is not induced into it mean bias error mbe is the average magnitude of the set of errors between prediction and observed data that does not include the direction padilla hernandez et al 2007 if the signs of the errors are included then it is called as the mean absolute error mae the mbe is represented as 16 m b e 1 n m o the mean bias error signifies the trends in the error i e whether the model consistently over predicts or under predicts with respect to the field measurement remya et al 2012 umesh et al 2017 in order to better evaluate the performance of the model in terms of numerical modelling viewpoint the percentage error pe was computed brown 2010 percentage error that is also known as the mean relative error accuracy is defined as the difference between the modelled and measured parameters with respect to the percentage of the measured field data 17 p e 100 i 1 n m i o i o i all the above mentioned statistical methods of error analysis were used in this study to evaluate the performance of wind drag estimation methods for numerically computing the storm wave and surge parameters 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation of water levels the coupled model adcirc swan simulations were performed with all five wind stress evaluation methods wu s method garratt s method l p s method zijlema s method and wblm to compute the water levels current velocities significant wave heights at all the nodal points in the domain the wind field for the entire domain was constructed using the gahm model based on the jtwc cyclone track information and it was compared with the field data recorded from the deep water buoy bd11 fig 5 a and b represents the comparison of the model computed wind speeds with the observed data for both the cyclones thane and vardah which clearly indicates that the model has captured the wind speeds and profiles very well along with the maximum wind intensities as the cyclones progressed towards the coast the maximum wind speeds m s obtained at all the nodal locations in the domain is represented in fig 6 which shows the extent of high wind speeds caused by cyclone thane and vardah at the tide gauge stations ennore and nagapattinam wind intensities of 19 m s were noticed for cyclone thane while for cyclone vardah it was 37 m s in ennore and 14 m s in nagapattinam the peak wind speeds at the deep water buoy location bd11 was found to be 14 m s and 22 m s respectively for cyclone thane and vardah and in the shallow water buoy point wrbp it was 31 5 m s and 15 m s for cyclone thane and vardah respectively the model generated wind field was then forced in to the coupled model to estimate the water levels and wave parameters the water levels computed at the coastal locations ennore and nagapattinam using all five wind stress evaluation methods for both the cyclones were compared with the available observed values obtained from the ennore and nagapattinam tide gauge stations the observed data from both the tide gauge stations were at 1 min frequency with severe noised values henceforth the moving average technique was adopted to smoothen out the measured data and the smoothened data was used for the comparison of model results as represented in fig 7 and fig 8 it is observed that the water levels computed based on the wblm and zijlema s method as both these methods accounts the decreasing trend of drag coefficient at high wind speed for cyclone thane shows a very good comparison with the measurements as shown in fig 7 a and b similarly the wblm and zijlema s method based water levels estimated for vardah cyclone also shows a closer match with the available observations as represented in fig 8 a and b as the tide gauge station at ennore was located along the vardah cyclone track the sensors stopped recording after 0600 h utc on 12th december 2016 due to extreme weather conditions this restricted the comparison of maximum water levels during the cyclone s landfall fig 8 a distinctly explains the influence of the cyclonic surge component in the change of total water level elevations with respect to its mean at the time of cyclone vardah s landfall 1100 utc 12th dec 2011 considering the fact that the winds are stronger on the right side of a cyclone s track due to its anti clock wise forward movement on the northern hemisphere higher surge levels are observed at ennore located on the right side of the track fig 8a than nagapattinam fig 8b the maximum water levels were evaluated at all the nodal points in the domain using the wblm method for both the cyclones and are displayed in fig 9 a and b fig 9 clearly explains the change in total water levels in the entire domain with respect to its natural tide and surge shoved variation it was also observed that the maximum water levels are higher along the cyclone track and the near shore regions the maximum water level elevation for cyclones thane and vardah at the time of their corresponding landfall landfall point and its nearby locations was estimated to be around 1 1 5 m by the wblm based model which also corresponds well with the imd reported maximum water level of 1 2 m statistical error analysis was carried out for the estimated water levels by computing the mean standard deviation as represented in table 1 root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r mean bias error mbe and percentage error pe for both the cyclones and are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a and b and fig 10 c and d shows the rmse r mbe and pe for cyclones thane and vardah respectively it can be noticed through the error analysis results that in most cases the zijlema and wblm based water level computations consistently performs better than other linear wind drag methods wu s method garratt s method l p s method with lower rmse pe and higher r although zijlema s method correlates well with the observed water level data as the wind speed of thane and vardah did not exceed 42 m s the method may not hold good for calculating the drag coefficient when the wind speed is greater than 55 m s as the quadratic function gives a higher decreasing slope for wind speeds greater than 55 m s which may lead to underestimation of surge the comparison and analysis of peak water levels estimated by the models at the time of landfall could not be performed due to the inadequacy of observed data in the case of cyclone thane neither of the two tidal stations ennore and nagapattinam were in near vicinity region of the cyclone s landfall whereas in case of cyclone vardah ennore station was close by but unable to record data at the landfall time due to extreme weather conditions however the present investigation of the storm surge computations using five different wind stress methods compared proves the fact that wblm is the best suitable method to estimate the wind stress factor as it can even be applicable for cyclones having wind speeds above 55 m s 4 2 estimation of significant wave heights it is necessary to estimate the significant wave heights in the domain and validate the model capability as it greatly influences the accuracy of any storm surge modelling study the model swan computed significant wave heights were compared with in situ data to evaluate the performance of the wind drag estimation methods the in situ data buoy data was obtained from the indian national centre for ocean information services incois the simulated significant wave heights using all the five wind stress methods were compared with the buoy data fetched from stations situated closer to the cyclone s track and its associated landfall regions the model computed significant wave heights hs were compared with the in situ buoy data at both deep water buoy bd11 and shallow water buoy wave rider buoy pondicherry wrbp locations for cyclone thane and vardah and are shown in fig 11 a and b and fig 12 a and b respectively the analysis of figs 11 and 12 shows that wu and garratt s methods over estimates the wave heights due to the implementation of linear formulation of cd with higher slope and higher cut off values whereas l p s method significantly underestimates hs due to the implementation of cd formulae with reduced slope and lower cut off values zijlema s and wblm based hs results demonstrated a rather succinct and balanced performance despite a certain minor degree of underestimation of the significant wave heights thereby rendering higher preference to its results over that of the other three bulk formulae s as the cyclonic wind field is given as an input without accounting for the pre and post existing regular wind field there is an apparent artefact of underestimation observed in both zijlema s and wblm based model estimates the hs computed using zijlema and wblm methods at wrbp due to cyclone thane fig 11 b and bd11 due to cyclone vardah fig 12 a are found to agree well with the in situ data at respective locations this agreement was achieved as the buoy locations were present very close to the cyclones track where the influence of regular pre and post existing wind conditions were minimal thus affirmatively the wind field generated from its best track was good enough to capture the peak storm wave height by the model through zijlema s and wblm method although swan was relatively known to be a nearshore wave model as it quite comfortably solves the shallow water dynamics it also accomplished effective results in the deep water locations for extreme weather conditions the activation terms like white capping depth induced breaking and triad wave wave interaction processes that was incited in the wave model were well executed in the deep water regions too as mentioned earlier for better estimation of storm surge time series the pre existing wind and wave conditions in the entire area needs to be included in the numerical modelling fig 13 delineates the spatial variation of the maximum hs obtained in the entire domain using wblm method for the complete duration of both the cyclones the maximum hs shown in fig 13 also enumerates that the winds were quite stronger on the right side of these cyclones which produced larger wave heights on that side compared to left side of the track cyclones thane and vardah generated maximum significant wave heights of 11 4 m and 11 2 m on their respective forward movements from the deep water towards the shorelines the deep water storm waves created by these cyclones reduce their energy towards to the near shore areas due to shoaling and wave breaking could also be visualized in fig 13 the model computed storm wave parameters were also evaluated through various statistical error analysis methods with respect to the observed data the mean and standard deviation calculated and tabulated in table 2 indicates the consistency of the significant wave heights computed by the coupled model using the wblm method with respect to the observed data fig 14 a and b and fig 14 c and d represents the rmse r mbe and pe for cyclones thane and vardah respectively the significant wave heights estimated through the wblm method also attained maximum r and minimum rmse pe as shown in fig 14 in comparison to the other three linear wind drag estimation methods the over and under estimation of the model results with respect to the observed data was also clearly indicated through the mbe analysis of fig 14 in fig 14 a the wblm and zijlema s method based results of cyclone thane is under predicted as the errors are attributed due to considering only the cyclone best track information and not the pre existing wind wave climate i e the corresponding buoy location bd11 is almost 250 km away from cyclone thane s track and the wind model considers only the best track wind information the error analysis results portrayed through fig 14 demonstrates the efficacy of wblm method based computation of storm wave heights the wblm and zijlema s quadratic function was found to generate the realistic representation of wind stress and storm wave attributes for wind speeds greater than 30 m s to better simulate the cyclonic storm surge however as aforementioned in section 4 1 zijlema s method can be used for cyclones that has wind speeds up to 55 m s as the numerical models may tend to underestimate the surge and wave components if the quadratic function is adopted to estimate the wind drag coefficient for cyclones that exceeds 55 m s wind speed category 4 and 5 hurricanes that are very common in the atlantic ocean thus it is recommended to compute the wind stress using the wblm as it can be used for cyclones hurricanes with extreme wind conditions up to 80 m s to better predict the storm surge and wave attributes 5 summary and conclusions numerical modelling of cyclonic storm surge with higher precision is important to enhance the prediction and mitigation planning systems to maintain a better coastal resilience the accuracy of numerical storm wave and storm surge estimation primarily depends on the wind forcing wind stress or wind drag represented by the wind drag coefficient the present study aimed at modelling of near accurate storm waves and surge using five different wind drag estimation methods to ascertain the most suitable method for tropical cyclones i e thane and vardah in the bay of bengal basin the vital conclusions drawn from the research work are 1 the water levels estimated using zijlema s and wblm method closely corresponded with the observed values and found to be better compared to the other three linear empirical formulations garratt l p and wu the wblm based water levels rendered the maximum correlation coefficient r 0 88 0 98 with respect to the observed field data which is higher compared to that of the other linear and quadratic methods garratt r 0 83 0 90 l p r 0 86 0 94 wu r 0 81 0 89 zijlema r 0 88 0 97 the spatial distribution of maximum water levels propelled by the cyclones to the shoreline obtained based on the wblm method shows a credible agreement with the imd reported values 2 the comparison of model computed significant wave heights with the two in situ buoy bd11 deep water buoy and wrbp shallow water buoy data also clearly shows the efficiency of the wblm method over the other wind stress methods in extreme wind conditions the simulated storm wave heights using wblm at both deep water and shallow water regions were observed to have high correlation coefficients ranging from 0 80 to 0 97 for capturing the peak significant wave height however the building up and receding wave heights could be better simulated by accounting for the pre and post existing wind and wave conditions in the entire area 3 storm surge simulations should be carried out using a coupled circulation and wave model using a robust wind stress evaluation method to include the realistic scenario of air sea interaction process in extreme cyclonic events the present study recommends the wblm method for the evaluation of wind stress as it is potent enough and includes the pragmatic energetic exchange at the air sea interface in computation of wind drag coefficient for high wind conditions exceeding 35 m s although zijlema s method has simulated better results in the present study as the maximum wind speeds of thane and vardah were limited to 42 m s the quadratic function may not be applicable for wind speeds greater than 55 m s conclusively it could be stated that wblm method should be adopted in the numerical computations of near real time storm surge prediction studies working towards asserting modelled estimates with enhanced precision acknowledgements the

22407,modelling of storm surge numerically has always been strenuous as it is associated with various influencing factors the major governing component being the wind forcing or the wind stress that signifies the computational accuracy of simulated surge and wave parameters the present study is aimed at analysing the most reliable wind drag evaluation method for real time predictions of storm surge in an attempt to examine the same two tropical cyclones thane and vardah eventuated in the northern indian ocean were modelled four most widely used linear empirical and quadratic relations along with the enhanced wave boundary layer model wblm were executed for the estimations of wind drag coefficient the surge was subsequently simulated using the coupled hydrodynamic circulation and wave model adcirc and swan respectively individually for each of the above wind stress methods to obtain the corresponding water levels and wave features the modelled values were further validated with the observed water level and wave data it was quite intuitively observed that wblm outperformed i e significantly correlated with the observed values its linear counterparts since the former pragmatically includes the effects of air sea interface at high wind speeds in the model however due to insufficiency of the observed parameters water levels obtained at locations of maximum wind speeds could not be satisfactorily validated the wblm based computation of significant wave heights in deep as well as shallow water nevertheless enabled efficient and reasonably reliable estimations of the peak incidents along with relative wave directions and energy densities although this study essentially includes cyclonic wind velocities it was identified that with given wind field that includes the pre existing wind wave climate in the relevant domain i e before the cyclone genesis the modelled estimates could be more precise keywords storm surge storm wave wind drag coefficient wave boundary layer model adcirc swan bay of bengal 1 introduction cyclonic storms have proved catastrophic in multiple occurrences thereby mandating immediate and dedicated study for precise real time predictions it has been observed that five out of the seven saarc nations except nepal and bhutan that are surrounded by land mass are greatly affected due to tropical cyclones tidal waves and their augmented effects the boundless coastline of india 7500 km surrounded by the two major basins of the northern indian ocean bay of bengal on the east and arabian sea on the west has historically always been prone to severe cyclonic storm surge events in particular the bay of bengal bob basin has emanated the most devastating ones that has been cataclysmic in varying degrees components like the shallow shores of the bob the low and flat coastal terrain of india and bangladesh and the funnel shaped coastline combination tend to produce such intensive surge events almost 14 of the population of india have their habitats along the coastal stretches and are highly vulnerable to such extreme sea level events in the recorded history of such events the surge 10 m caused by cyclone bhola in the year 1970 on the coasts of bangladesh madsen and jakobsen 2004 is considered the most intensive one a super cyclonic storm scs that made its landfall in the odisha coast in 1999 is observed to be the highest of about 7 5 m surge causing event in context of indian scenario dube et al 2000 thus it necessitates a quantitative understanding of these phenomena which could consequently aid the prediction such that the precautionary actions could be adopted on time although quantifying a natural phenomenon includes numerous complicated factors per se several models have been developed to simulate and predict a storm s behaviour storm surge modelling and prevising of such events therefore need to be essentiated in order to safe guard the lives and interest of the nation numerically modelling storm surge has always been considered an exacting task and the research community has constantly been working towards better and more precise solutions over the past few decades such modelling requires various input parameters like wind velocity central pressure of the cyclone local bathymetry tidal input and wave stress gradients in case when coupled with a wave model these input parameters are collected and generated through various data sources and models which is then fed to the surge model to simulate the vertical elevation of surge and inundation levels a detailed approach on such studies towards indian coastal regions are reported by murty et al 1986 dube et al 1997 2009 it is a familiar fact that the ocean currents and waves are steered through the momentum fluxes across air sea interface to evaluate this momentum flux at the air sea interface at high wind speeds is still an exhausting way to accomplish through numerical methods a simplified approach to identifying this transfer of momentum is through shear stress which is also known as the wind stress and is expressed as 1 τ ρ a u 2 ρ a c d u 10 2 where ρ a is the density of air u is the shear velocity u 10 is the horizontal wind speed at an height of 10 m above the sea surface and cd is the wind drag coefficient several researchers have stated about the empirical computation of the wind drag coefficient as a function of wind speed nevertheless this approach might not be suitable for extreme events like cyclonic surge estimation as the wind speed exceeds 35 m s quite frequently the empirical relations proposed by garratt 1977 large and pond 1981 and wu 1982 are the most extensively used ones the wind drag coefficient cd is also used to calculate the boundary layer parameters as reported through many contemporary models like sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes slosh e g jelesnianski et al 1992 phan et al 2013 advanced circulation multidimensional hydrodynamic model adcirc e g westerink and luettich 1991 dietrich et al 2011 bhaskaran et al 2014 finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom e g huang et al 2010 zheng et al 2013 in terms of application these empirical methods were usually presumed to be applied for high wind conditions whereas the recent studies by powell et al 2003 and holthuijsen et al 2012 stated that it was inappropriate the wind drag coefficient attains a levelled off nature and rather reduces at very high winds crossing 35 40 m s hence the uncertainties revolving around this wind drag coefficient has not been completely perceived the phenomenon of wind drag reduction at high winds has reportedly makin and kudryavtsev 2002 donelan et al 2004 kudryavtsev 2006 been ascribed to the change in momentum transfer due to the uninterrupted breaking of waves however some other studies andreas 2004 kudryavtsev and makin 2011 etc assert that it is due to the sea spray effect on the boundary layer that was consequently generated due to the same phenomenon i e uninterrupted breaking of waves therefore the preferable alternative is to cap the wind drag on a threshold value or even assume a law for decreasing coefficients bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2010 zijlema et al 2012 it is hence noteworthy to mention that the study performed by moon et al 2009 with the wblm coupled with wind and surge models generated better results with realistic scenario further the development of wblm through the inclusion of sea spray effect chen and yu 2016 2017 has brought in a pragmatic way of representing the wind drag coefficient for extreme wind conditions 35 m s the recent enhanced wblm chen and yu 2016 solves the dynamics through momentum and energy conservation equations of the wave boundary layer by accounting for more physical attributes involved in an air sea interaction process the total stress computed through the model is a constant and is conventionally said to be the sum of the wave induced stress and turbulent stress with the above mentioned way of including the sea spray effect the wblm is able to reproduce the decreasing tendency of the wind drag coefficient at very high wind speeds chen and yu 2016 the storm wave modelling study by chen and yu 2017 also substantiated the significance of the above mentioned enhanced model however its efficacy in assessing surge caused by a tropical cyclone is yet to be authenticated also chen and yu 2017 executed the enhanced wblm with the wave spectrum obtained from a standalone run of a wave model swave where the ambient flows between the tide surge and wave is neglected hence the current study directs its objective towards a comparative analysis of cyclonic surge modelling using the enhanced wblm with the two dimensional wave spectral input coming from a coupled circulation and wave model to account for the non linear interaction of tide surge and wave along with the enhanced wblm four other bulk formulae methods are also used for computing the wind drag coefficients followed by the storm surge and wave estimations for executing the same two cyclonic conditions namely cyclone thane 2011 and cyclone vardah 2016 as their tracks and landfall points are shown in fig 1 were considered both these cyclones have been characterised as very severe cyclonic storm vscs by the indian meteorological department imd as their wind speed exceeded 35 m s the present study employs the coupled hydrodynamic circulation model adcirc and the third generation wave model simulating waves nearshore swan e g booij et al 1999 to simulate the storm surge with the wind stress coefficients obtained from wblm the following sections give a brief discussion about both cyclone thane and cyclone vardah and the wind fields developed for the modelling the execution of the coupled model adcirc swan with the empirical methods and wblm the results obtained from numerical modelling were subsequently validated with the observed data tide gauge stations and buoys collected from the indian national centre for ocean information services incois further a comparative analysis was carried out in the evaluations of storm surge and storm wave parameters in correlation with the wind drag estimation methods 2 cyclone description 2 1 cyclone thane on the afternoon hours 1200 utc of 25th december 2011 imd reported a depression formed over the southeast bay of bengal and lay centred approximately 8 5 n 88 5 e imd national bulletin report 2011 the system intensified into deep depression after 15 h with wind speed exceeding 14 m s and transforming into a cyclonic storm cs wind speed crossed 17 m s at 1800 utc on 26th dec 2011 the system was named as thane by imd and it continued to stay as a cyclonic storm for the next 30 h period and moved towards the tamil nadu coast of india it intensified further into a severe and then a very severe cyclonic storm in 6 h interval at 1200 utc on 28th dec 2011 thane attained its maximum intensity of 46 m s and made its landfall around 0100 to 0200 utc on 30th dec 2011 between the coasts of cuddalore and puducherry along the east coast of india the havoc caused by thane to the coastal structures and properties were enormous it was observed that a maximum of 1 1 5 m height of storm surges above the astronomical tide inundated the coastal stretches of ennore chennai puducherry and cuddalore it was reported that there were 46 fatalities together in puducherry and cuddalore district imd wmo report 2012 2 2 cyclone vardah cyclone vardah formed as a depression in the morning hours

its intensity into a depression and finally as a low pressure system storm surges of maximum 1 m height inundated the coastal stretches of ennore chennai and thiruvallur districts of tamil nadu and nellore district of andhra pradesh imd wmo report 2017 the tracks of cyclone thane and vardah has been depicted in fig 1 with demarcated locations of the tide gauge stations ennore and chennai and buoys bd11 and wave rider buoy pondicherry wrbp the tide gauge stations and buoy locations were chosen based on the path of both the cyclones thane and vardah and the data availability 3 materials and methods 3 1 advanced circulation adcirc model this study uses the two dimensional depth integrated 2ddi adcirc model that solves the shallow water equations swe to obtain the water levels ζ and vertically integrated momentum equations to obtain the currents u kolar et al 1994 luettich and westerink 2004 dawson et al 2006 westerink et al 2008 the uninterrupted galerkin finite element method is used to solve the unstructured triangular elements in space whereas finite difference method is adopted in solving the temporal progression dietrich et al 2011 this numerical technique maintains the stability in the model at high resolution spatial discretisation where the gradients tends to be the largest tanaka et al 2011 the water levels are obtained through gwce generalised wave

optimizes the phase propagation properties atkinson et al 2004 dietrich et al 2012 various studies have been reported on the wetting and drying algorithms that adcirc uses to activate and deactivate elements based on the upturn and downturn of water depth blain et al 2002 dietrich et al 2004 2006 dick et al 2013 an element is considered to be wet only when all three vertices are wet if not then the corresponding element is taken as dry for that particular time step adcirc adopts implicit and explicit procedures to solve the gwce implicit scheme operates on the principle of jacobi conjugate gradient jcg method whereas the explicit scheme uses lumped diagonal mass matrix which solves at a faster rate than implicit dietrich et al 2004 2012 further once the water levels are obtained with respect to wetting and drying algorithms the momentum equations are solved to estimate the water currents 3 2 simulating waves nearshore swan model swan the third generation wave model used in this study solves the action balance equation through the method of gauss siedel algorithm to obtain the wave parameters the advantage of swan over the other computational models is that it can be applied over large domains to resolve the length and time scales of wind generated waves booij et al 1999 dietrich et al 2011 the gradual development of the wind generated waves can be described through the governing wave action balance equation 7 n t x c g u n c θ n θ c σ n σ s t o t σ where n x t σ θ is the wave action density spectrum change of wave action in time t σ is the relative frequency θ is

linear wave interaction components s n l 3 and s n l 4 swan operates on the basis of action density spectrum n σ θ instead of energy density spectrum e σ θ since in the presence of ambient currents the action density is conserved whereas energy density is not whitham 1974 hence the phase resolving is achieved steadily even at finer scales moreover to maintain the stability on unstructured grids swan adopts an analog label to the gauss siedel iteration method zijlema 2010 due to the above mentioned key characterizations the circulation model adcirc and wave model swan are coupled to run on a parallel environment with the same unstructured triangular mesh for the computation of storm wave and surge characteristics in the fully coupled model adcirc first solves the shallow water equations to evaluate the wind velocities water levels and current velocities which is then passed on to swan to force its computations swan follows with the calculation of wave parameters and their corresponding radiation stresses on the following time step which is then fed as an input to adcirc the exchange of data between these two models on the parallel computing environment happens at each time step internally through local memory dietrich et al 2012 the coupling time interval between these two models are based on swan s time step for the current model simulations adcirc time step was considered to be 1 s as it is limited to courant number stabilization for its explicit method whereas swan s time step is prescribed as 1800 s owing to greater stability of the model 3 3 wind drag estimation methods the most important driving factor of numerical surge and wave modelling is the wind stress that is calculated by the corresponding models the wind stress which is directly proportional to its wind drag formulations can improve the accuracy of any surge or wave computation to a great extent when represented in a more realistic way in the present work five wind drag estimation methods namely the wblm wave boundary layer model and four most widely used empirical formulations developed by garratt 1977 large and pond 1981 wu 1982 and zijlema et al 2012 are considered for the investigation of wind stress computation and its corresponding storm surge estimation 3 3 1 garratt s method the bulk formulae proposed by garratt 1977 is the most widely used in terms of coupled adcirc and swan modelling bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011 2012 and it is given as 8 c d 10 3 0 75 0 067 u 10 u 10 41 m s 3 5 u 10 41 m s the c d calculated through equation 8 increases linearly with the increase of wind speed up to 41 m s and is capped by the numerical model adcirc at 0 0035 for high wind speeds beyond 41 m s to restrict unrealistic water level outputs 3 3 2 large and pond l p method the relation developed by large and pond 1981 can be written as 9 c d 10 3 1 2 u 10 11 m s 0 49 0 065 u 10 11 u 10 25 m s 2 115 u 10 25 m s this formulation is used in the finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom to simulate coupled surge and wave characteristics it is capped at a constant value beyond 25 m s wind speed the major difference between equations 8 and 9 is the upper limit at which c d is capped which in turn implies that there is still no solidarity in estimating the wind drag coefficient at high wind speeds 3 3 3 wu s method wu in 1982 formulated another empirical relation for estimating the wind drag and it is denoted as 10 c d 10 3 1 2875 u 10 7 5 m s 0 8 0 065 u 10 u 10 7 5 m s the linear slope in the formulation corresponding to the wind speed is identical in both wu and l p s methods whereas the constants used with respect to boundary layer characteristic differs the method is directly adopted in swave model qi et al 2009 which is the modified version of swan to couple with fvcom and other circulation models 3 3 4 zijlema s method zijlema et al 2012 had developed a quadratic method that fits a polynomial regression function using different sets of field data reported through various studies with a decreasing trend in the drag coefficient at high wind speeds the quadratic function is expressed as 11 c d 10 3 0 55 2 97 u 1 49 u 2 where u u 10 31 5 and u 10 is measured in terms of m s equation 11 gives a quadratic approach to estimate the wind drag coefficient at high wind speeds in particular during cyclonic conditions 31 5 m s which is 30 less than that of wu s method as shown in fig 2 however zijlema s method fails to give a positive value at wind speeds 68 m s and thus a minimal constraint has to be added 3 3 5 wave boundary layer model wblm the hindmost atmospheric layer over the ocean surface is termed to be the boundary layer which is significantly affected due to the wave motion under extreme wind conditions over the past few decades researchers have advocated to evaluate the wind stress that affects the wave motion through the correlation of momentum and energy conservation methods longuet higgins 1957 phillips 1985 janssen 1989 makin and kudryavtsev 1999 hara and belcher 2002 2004 moon et al 2004a 2004b the current study utilizes the enhanced wave boundary layer model developed by chen and yu 2016 where the wind shear stress τ is obtained by solving the conservation of mass and momentum equations for the atmospheric boundary layer 12 d d z u τ t o t d π w d z ρ a ε g ρ w ρ a α s k d s d z 0 13 τ t o t τ w z τ t z where τ w and τ t are the respective wave induced stress and turbulent stress occur locally u is the wind vector at the height z above the sea surface π w is the wave induced motion s vertical flux energy ε is the viscous dissipation rate α s is the reciprocal of turbulent schmidt number k is the turbulent eddy viscosity and s is the sea spray s volumetric concentration at height z above the sea surface chen and yu 2017 the wave induced stress is computed through the spectrum obtained from wave model through the bulk formulae it is to be noted that there are different formulations used by models to determine the high frequency spectrum fed into wblm donelan et al 2012 reichl et al 2014 fig 2 represents the comparison of wind drag estimations at various wind speeds for wblm and three other bulk formulae s used in this study the wind drag coefficients calculated through wblm shows a lowering trend instead of levelling off at very high wind speeds similar to the field measurements reported by powell et al 2003 as shown in fig 2 the limitation to the current modelling study is that it requires a pre run output of the wave spectrum from a numerical wave model which is computationally expensive and time consuming however it is negligible as the current day wave models can be coupled with wblm to execute the same 3 4 methodology the simulations of the present study as represented with the methodology flow diagram shown in fig 3 were carried out with the coupled adcirc circulation model and swan wave model on an unstructured triangular mesh whose two dimensional directional wave spectrum output is taken as an input forcing into the wblm to calculate the viscous stress τ v wave induced stress τ w roughness length and wind drag coefficient eventually the wind shear stress τ is computed and given back as an input to the coupled circulation and wave model to finally obtain the water levels and wave attributes for both the cyclonic conditions the model domain with bathymetric depth is shown in fig 4 which also illustrates the spatial extent that covers a significant part of the bob basin the domain was discretised with an unstructured triangular mesh of 463 752 elements and 233 802 nodes the bathymetric data from gebco general bathymetric chart of the oceans with 30 arc second data interval along with a high resolution nho national hydrographic office govt of india chart was used to define the water depth at all the nodal points mesh size of approximately 200 1000 m was discretised along the near shore regions while the deep ocean was discretised with 15 20 km resolution roughly as mentioned earlier the simulations were performed for two cyclonic scenarios namely thane and vardah which occurred in 2011 and 2016 respectively the simulation time frame for thane was from 25th december 2011 12 00 h to 30th december 12 00 h utc 5 days whereas for vardah it was executed from 6th december 2016 6 00 h to 13th december 2016 6 00 h utc 7 days the wind and pressure inputs given to the model is through the best track information obtained from the joint typhoon warning centre jtwc using which the wind and pressure fields are constructed through the generalised asymmetric holland model gahm an inbuilt module in adcirc for the simulations gahm interpolates wind speeds to all the nodal points of the domain through the information specified in the best track data by jtwc the bottom friction was assigned to be hybrid with parameters like cb hb θ and λ are set to 0 0026 1 10 and 1 3 respectively bhaskaran et al 2014 time step for the circulation model on both the cyclonic cases was considered to be 1 s which satisfies the stability cfl criteria westerink et al 1994 with respect to the domain resolution on the other hand swan s time step was posed to 1800 s and the coupling time interval was matched between adcirc and swan i e the exchange of wind velocities water levels and current velocities from adcirc and wave radiation stresses from swan will happen every 1800 s the computational space was discretised to 72 wave directional intervals with 5 increment and the wave frequency intervals are sorted out to 40 with a logarithmic increase across the range 0 0285 1 1726 energy changes due to white capping depth induced wave breaking and wave wave interaction were also activated all five wind stress evaluation methods garratt wu l p zijlema and wblm were implemented separately to calculate the surge and wave attributes 3 5 statistical error analysis to evaluate and compare the performance of the model generated results using various wind drag methods and the observed values statistical performance indicators such as the mean standard deviation root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r mean bias error mbe and mean relative error accuracy or percentage error pe were used the primary assumption made to compute these statistical parameters were that the observed measured data are error free while the generalised mean and standard deviation methods were calculated the rmse was computed using the following relationship 14 r m s e 1 n m o 2 where m represents the model predicted and o represents the observed values for a set of n rmse derives the line of best fit between the model predicted and the observed values umesh et al 2017 it is inferred that the lower value of rmse gives the best fit between model and observed data correlation coefficient is another often used method to establish the relation between the model and observed values it signifies the strength of the relationship between the model and observed parameters with a numerical value higher value if strong correlation persists and lower value to zero if they are independent it is defined as follows 15 r m m o o m m 2 o o 2 where m and o represents the mean of the model predicted and observed values respectively if the value of the correlation coefficient is close to one then it indicates that there is a high positive correlation between model and observed data with low random error however the systematic error is not induced into it mean bias error mbe is the average magnitude of the set of errors between prediction and observed data that does not include the direction padilla hernandez et al 2007 if the signs of the errors are included then it is called as the mean absolute error mae the mbe is represented as 16 m b e 1 n m o the mean bias error signifies the trends in the error i e whether the model consistently over predicts or under predicts with respect to the field measurement remya et al 2012 umesh et al 2017 in order to better evaluate the performance of the model in terms of numerical modelling viewpoint the percentage error pe was computed brown 2010 percentage error that is also known as the mean relative error accuracy is defined as the difference between the modelled and measured parameters with respect to the percentage of the measured field data 17 p e 100 i 1 n m i o i o i all the above mentioned statistical methods of error analysis were used in this study to evaluate the performance of wind drag estimation methods for numerically computing the storm wave and surge parameters 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation of water levels the coupled model adcirc swan simulations were performed with all five wind stress evaluation methods wu s method garratt s method l p s method zijlema s method and wblm to compute the water levels current velocities significant wave heights at all the nodal points in the domain the wind field for the entire domain was constructed using the gahm model based on the jtwc cyclone track information and it was compared with the field data recorded from the deep water buoy bd11 fig 5 a and b represents the comparison of the model computed wind speeds with the observed data for both the cyclones thane and vardah which clearly indicates that the model has captured the wind speeds and profiles very well along with the maximum wind intensities as the cyclones progressed towards the coast the maximum wind speeds m s obtained at all the nodal locations in the domain is represented in fig 6 which shows the extent of high wind speeds caused by cyclone thane and vardah at the tide gauge stations ennore and nagapattinam wind intensities of 19 m s were noticed for cyclone thane while for cyclone vardah it was 37 m s in ennore and 14 m s in nagapattinam the peak wind speeds at the deep water buoy location bd11 was found to be 14 m s and 22 m s respectively for cyclone thane and vardah and in the shallow water buoy point wrbp it was 31 5 m s and 15 m s for cyclone thane and vardah respectively the model generated wind field was then forced in to the coupled model to estimate the water levels and wave parameters the water levels computed at the coastal locations ennore and nagapattinam using all five wind stress evaluation methods for both the cyclones were compared with the available observed values obtained from the ennore and nagapattinam tide gauge stations the observed data from both the tide gauge stations were at 1 min frequency with severe noised values henceforth the moving average technique was adopted to smoothen out the measured data and the smoothened data was used for the comparison of model results as represented in fig 7 and fig 8 it is observed that the water levels computed based on the wblm and zijlema s method as both these methods accounts the decreasing trend of drag coefficient at high wind speed for cyclone thane shows a very good comparison with the measurements as shown in fig 7 a and b similarly the wblm and zijlema s method based water levels estimated for vardah cyclone also shows a closer match with the available observations as represented in fig 8 a and b as the tide gauge station at ennore was located along the vardah cyclone track the sensors stopped recording after 0600 h utc on 12th december 2016 due to extreme weather conditions this restricted the comparison of maximum water levels during the cyclone s landfall fig 8 a distinctly explains the influence of the cyclonic surge component in the change of total water level elevations with respect to its mean at the time of cyclone vardah s landfall 1100 utc 12th dec 2011 considering the fact that the winds are stronger on the right side of a cyclone s track due to its anti clock wise forward movement on the northern hemisphere higher surge levels are observed at ennore located on the right side of the track fig 8a than nagapattinam fig 8b the maximum water levels were evaluated at all the nodal points in the domain using the wblm method for both the cyclones and are displayed in fig 9 a and b fig 9 clearly explains the change in total water levels in the entire domain with respect to its natural tide and surge shoved variation it was also observed that the maximum water levels are higher along the cyclone track and the near shore regions the maximum water level elevation for cyclones thane and vardah at the time of their corresponding landfall landfall point and its nearby locations was estimated to be around 1 1 5 m by the wblm based model which also corresponds well with the imd reported maximum water level of 1 2 m statistical error analysis was carried out for the estimated water levels by computing the mean standard deviation as represented in table 1 root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r mean bias error mbe and percentage error pe for both the cyclones and are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a and b and fig 10 c and d shows the rmse r mbe and pe for cyclones thane and vardah respectively it can be noticed through the error analysis results that in most cases the zijlema and wblm based water level computations consistently performs better than other linear wind drag methods wu s method garratt s method l p s method with lower rmse pe and higher r although zijlema s method correlates well with the observed water level data as the wind speed of thane and vardah did not exceed 42 m s the method may not hold good for calculating the drag coefficient when the wind speed is greater than 55 m s as the quadratic function gives a higher decreasing slope for wind speeds greater than 55 m s which may lead to underestimation of surge the comparison and analysis of peak water levels estimated by the models at the time of landfall could not be performed due to the inadequacy of observed data in the case of cyclone thane neither of the two tidal stations ennore and nagapattinam were in near vicinity region of the cyclone s landfall whereas in case of cyclone vardah ennore station was close by but unable to record data at the landfall time due to extreme weather conditions however the present investigation of the storm surge computations using five different wind stress methods compared proves the fact that wblm is the best suitable method to estimate the wind stress factor as it can even be applicable for cyclones having wind speeds above 55 m s 4 2 estimation of significant wave heights it is necessary to estimate the significant wave heights in the domain and validate the model capability as it greatly influences the accuracy of any storm surge modelling study the model swan computed significant wave heights were compared with in situ data to evaluate the performance of the wind drag estimation methods the in situ data buoy data was obtained from the indian national centre for ocean information services incois the simulated significant wave heights using all the five wind stress methods were compared with the buoy data fetched from stations situated closer to the cyclone s track and its associated landfall regions the model computed significant wave heights hs were compared with the in situ buoy data at both deep water buoy bd11 and shallow water buoy wave rider buoy pondicherry wrbp locations for cyclone thane and vardah and are shown in fig 11 a and b and fig 12 a and b respectively the analysis of figs 11 and 12 shows that wu and garratt s methods over estimates the wave heights due to the implementation of linear formulation of cd with higher slope and higher cut off values whereas l p s method significantly underestimates hs due to the implementation of cd formulae with reduced slope and lower cut off values zijlema s and wblm based hs results demonstrated a rather succinct and balanced performance despite a certain minor degree of underestimation of the significant wave heights thereby rendering higher preference to its results over that of the other three bulk formulae s as the cyclonic wind field is given as an input without accounting for the pre and post existing regular wind field there is an apparent artefact of underestimation observed in both zijlema s and wblm based model estimates the hs computed using zijlema and wblm methods at wrbp due to cyclone thane fig 11 b and bd11 due to cyclone vardah fig 12 a are found to agree well with the in situ data at respective locations this agreement was achieved as the buoy locations were present very close to the cyclones track where the influence of regular pre and post existing wind conditions were minimal thus affirmatively the wind field generated from its best track was good enough to capture the peak storm wave height by the model through zijlema s and wblm method although swan was relatively known to be a nearshore wave model as it quite comfortably solves the shallow water dynamics it also accomplished effective results in the deep water locations for extreme weather conditions the activation terms like white capping depth induced breaking and triad wave wave interaction processes that was incited in the wave model were well executed in the deep water regions too as mentioned earlier for better estimation of storm surge time series the pre existing wind and wave conditions in the entire area needs to be included in the numerical modelling fig 13 delineates the spatial variation of the maximum hs obtained in the entire domain using wblm method for the complete duration of both the cyclones the maximum hs shown in fig 13 also enumerates that the winds were quite stronger on the right side of these cyclones which produced larger wave heights on that side compared to left side of the track cyclones thane and vardah generated maximum significant wave heights of 11 4 m and 11 2 m on their respective forward movements from the deep water towards the shorelines the deep water storm waves created by these cyclones reduce their energy towards to the near shore areas due to shoaling and wave breaking could also be visualized in fig 13 the model computed storm wave parameters were also evaluated through various statistical error analysis methods with respect to the observed data the mean and standard deviation calculated and tabulated in table 2 indicates the consistency of the significant wave heights computed by the coupled model using the wblm method with respect to the observed data fig 14 a and b and fig 14 c and d represents the rmse r mbe and pe for cyclones thane and vardah respectively the significant wave heights estimated through the wblm method also attained maximum r and minimum rmse pe as shown in fig 14 in comparison to the other three linear wind drag estimation methods the over and under estimation of the model results with respect to the observed data was also clearly indicated through the mbe analysis of fig 14 in fig 14 a the wblm and zijlema s method based results of cyclone thane is under predicted as the errors are attributed due to considering only the cyclone best track information and not the pre existing wind wave climate i e the corresponding buoy location bd11 is almost 250 km away from cyclone thane s track and the wind model considers only the best track wind information the error analysis results portrayed through fig 14 demonstrates the efficacy of wblm method based computation of storm wave heights the wblm and zijlema s quadratic function was found to generate the realistic representation of wind stress and storm wave attributes for wind speeds greater than 30 m s to better simulate the cyclonic storm surge however as aforementioned in section 4 1 zijlema s method can be used for cyclones that has wind speeds up to 55 m s as the numerical models may tend to underestimate the surge and wave components if the quadratic function is adopted to estimate the wind drag coefficient for cyclones that exceeds 55 m s wind speed category 4 and 5 hurricanes that are very common in the atlantic ocean thus it is recommended to compute the wind stress using the wblm as it can be used for cyclones hurricanes with extreme wind conditions up to 80 m s to better predict the storm surge and wave attributes 5 summary and conclusions numerical modelling of cyclonic storm surge with higher precision is important to enhance the prediction and mitigation planning systems to maintain a better coastal resilience the accuracy of numerical storm wave and storm surge estimation primarily depends on the wind forcing wind stress or wind drag represented by the wind drag coefficient the present study aimed at modelling of near accurate storm waves and surge using five different wind drag estimation methods to ascertain the most suitable method for tropical cyclones i e thane and vardah in the bay of bengal basin the vital conclusions drawn from the research work are 1 the water levels estimated using zijlema s and wblm method closely corresponded with the observed values and found to be better compared to the other three linear empirical formulations garratt l p and wu the wblm based water levels rendered the maximum correlation coefficient r 0 88 0 98 with respect to the observed field data which is higher compared to that of the other linear and quadratic methods garratt r 0 83 0 90 l p r 0 86 0 94 wu r 0 81 0 89 zijlema r 0 88 0 97 the spatial distribution of maximum water levels propelled by the cyclones to the shoreline obtained based on the wblm method shows a credible agreement with the imd reported values 2 the comparison of model computed significant wave heights with the two in situ buoy bd11 deep water buoy and wrbp shallow water buoy data also clearly shows the efficiency of the wblm method over the other wind stress methods in extreme wind conditions the simulated storm wave heights using wblm at both deep water and shallow water regions were observed to have high correlation coefficients ranging from 0 80 to 0 97 for capturing the peak significant wave height however the building up and receding wave heights could be better simulated by accounting for the pre and post existing wind and wave conditions in the entire area 3 storm surge simulations should be carried out using a coupled circulation and wave model using a robust wind stress evaluation method to include the realistic scenario of air sea interaction process in extreme cyclonic events the present study recommends the wblm method for the evaluation of wind stress as it is potent enough and includes the pragmatic energetic exchange at the air sea interface in computation of wind drag coefficient for high wind conditions exceeding 35 m s although zijlema s method has simulated better results in the present study as the maximum wind speeds of thane and vardah were limited to 42 m s the quadratic function may not be applicable for wind speeds greater than 55 m s conclusively it could be stated that wblm method should be adopted in the numerical computations of near real time storm surge prediction studies working towards asserting modelled estimates with enhanced precision acknowledgements the

22408,the approach angle of a cyclone in a coastal location plays a significant role while considering the worst case surge scenarios for coastal vulnerability studies the study focuses on the sensitivity of the approach angle on the tide surge interaction in a narrow continental shelf and concave coastal geometry to study the storm surge hydrodynamics we have performed simulations using the advanced circulation adcirc model considering thane cyclone by varying its angle of approach we investigated the variability in the storm surge behaviour within the concave coast by computing the net flux movement the highest surge amplitudes and highest storm tide occurred at an inflexion point and their magnitude varied based on the proximity of the cyclone track to the shore we found that at the landfall point the maximum surge height is for an approach angle of 75 then for 105 and the least for 45 the study also shows that the peak surge attributes under go a higher variability inside a concave coast even for those cyclone tracks on a similar shelf width and slopes a statistically highly significant positive correlation exists between the flux movement inside the concave coast and the surge height keywords cyclone storm surge approach angle concave coast continental shelf and slope coastal hydrodynamics 1 introduction the tropical cyclones originated in the bay of bengal bob and landfalling along the east coast of india have a tremendous socio economic impact on coastal resilience while landfalling the cyclone induced storm surge impact varies diversely along the coast depending on various factors the intensity of the cyclone pressure drop at the centre forward speed size of the cyclone slope and width of the continental shelf angle of approach and coastal geometry are some of the factors contributing to the storm surge characteristics and impact along the coast resio and westerink 2008 the national hurricane centre nhc a division of the national weather services of the united states generalises that higher storm surge is observed for a cyclone approaching perpendicular to the coast however the impact becomes worse depending on the local geographical features of the shore and approach angle of the cyclone several studies report the influence of various factors that affect storm surge characteristics the storm surge could vary up to 30 based on different storm size for a given intensity of cyclone irish et al 2008 rego and li 2009 reported that the storm s forward motion could result in higher flood volumes for a slow moving hurricane than a fast moving hurricane horsburgh and wilson 2007 as well as rego and li 2010 observed that highest nonlinear tide surge interaction takes place when a cyclone landfall at low tide with the mid ebb or mid flood scenario zhang 2012 conducted numerical experiments on a straight coastline with constant bathymetry and found that the approach angle and forward speed has a significant effect on storm surge zou et al 2013 found from their study that a slight shift in the storm track could result in large deviations in the predicted wave heights sensitivity of surge predictions to forecast uncertainties in the storm path and strength of hurricane arthur was performed by cyriac et al 2018 to conclude that the predicted water levels were sensitive to the cyclone track and the resulted water level response was non linear based on the changes in the storm strength and path storm surge in bob was first modelled by das 1972 and das et al 1974 by solving the linear shallow water long wave equations using finite difference method the study computed the storm surge due to bangladesh cyclone of 1970 that resulted in an overestimation in the surge amplitude as result of the uncertainities in the frictional stress as well as superposition of the astronomical tides johns and ali 1980 showed that a non linear surge model is necessary to understand the nature of tide surge interaction in shallow water adcirc model is one among the state of the art models based on the finite element method that is capable of representing the tide surge non linear interaction in the stand alone mode luettich et al 1992 the tide surge and wave interaction can be simulated using the coupled adcirc swan model dietrich et al 2012 presently this model is being used for forecasting the storm surge as well as to study the tide surge and wave interaction along the indian coast bhaskaran et al 2013 murty et al 2016 2014 nayak and bhaskaran 2013 rao et al 2013 tide surge interaction tide surge and wave interaction along the indian coast have been addressed by various researchers like gayathri et al 2016 poulose et al 2017 sahoo and bhaskaran 2017 sebastian and behera 2018 poulose et al 2017 studied the impact of varying continental shelf on the tide surge and wave interaction using a hypothetical linearly varying continental shelf along the west coast of india it was observed that with an increase in shelf width of about 10 km the peak surge height increased to about 12 cm nevertheless in the real world the varying shelf and slope profiles along with the complex coastal geometry results in a different surge behaviour altogether sebastian and behera 2018 carried out a preliminary investigation of storm surge behaviour due to cyclones helen and laila along the krishna godavari basin with complex coastal features the study observed that even though two storms made landfall at nearby locations the higher surge was along the bays and higher currents at the headlands the intensity of helen was 10 higher than laila still the magnitude of the peak surge characteristics remained the same for both the study clearly shows the influence of coastal geometry on the storm surge characteristics during these cyclones india has a coastline stretch of about 7517 km that includes both the mainland and island with the varying continental shelf and coastal geometry sanil kumar et al 2006 thus the response of storm surge could differ from coast to coast prediction of future storm characteristics based on historical data is highly uncertain the india meteorological department imd classifies tropical cyclones based on 3 min maximum sustained winds and are referred as cyclonic storm cs 17 5 24 5 m s severe cyclonic storm scs 24 5 32 5 m s very severe cyclonic storm vscs 32 5 46 m s extremely severe cyclonic storm escs 46 61 5 m s and super cyclonic storm sucs 61 5 m s an observation of past tropical cyclone 1990 2016 tracks from imd cyclone e atlas shows that no two cyclones were similar in characteristics and 60 of landfalling angles were not perpendicular to the coast fig 1 shows selected past cyclone tracks along the indian coast whose approach angles varied from almost parallel to perpendicular to the coast the approach angle of the cyclone is the angle between the cyclone track and the coastline on the right of the landfall which is on the north for this study the details category duration and approach angle of the cyclones shown in fig 1 are given in table 1 sahoo and bhaskaran 2017 evaluated the impact of approach angles 40 80 90 and 120 of cyclones on storm surge and inundation along odisha coast where a broad and shallow shelf and concluded that a closer proximity of the cyclone centre to the coastline increases the storm surge height along the coast however the southern part of the east coast of india has narrow and deeper continental shelves unlike the odisha coast also the southernmost part of the east coast of india is shadowed by sri lanka thus the behaviour of similar storm surge could be different along the southern part of the east coast of india i e tamil nadu coast tamil nadu coast is a micro tidal region frequently affected by cyclones with high intensity and different angle of approach although studies have been carried out to investigate the impact of cyclones landfall along tamil nadu coast bhaskaran et al 2014 2013 chittibabu et al 2002 nayak and bhaskaran 2013 rao et al 2013 srinivas et al 2012 no investigation on the effect of approach angles of cyclone on the storm surge and the underlying physics is reported so far as past studies on the approach angle have revealed that the storm surge hydrodynamics are site specific hence this study aims to investigate and understand the response of storm surge inside a concave coast under the influence of different approach angles of the cyclone thane cyclone shown in fig 1 a vscs with a maximum sustained wind intensity of about 46 m s on 29th december 2011 made landfall along a concave coast of tamil nadu with an approach angle of 75 thane cyclone made landfall on 30th december 2011 0100 utc during a low tide condition with maximum wind speed of about 33 m s a storm surge of about 1 m at the time of landfall was reported that inundated the low lying coastal regions of cuddalore pondicherry and villupuram bhaskaran et al 2013 the landfall point of thane cyclone located inside the concave coastal geometry is expected to generate high surge due to the convergence of energy also the thane cyclone with its landfall time coinciding with low tide condition has the possibility of higher surge tide interaction and thus considered for the present study the paper is organised as follows a short description about the adcirc model used for conducting numerical experiments is detailed in section 2 followed by detailed description about the model set up and initialisation used for the numerical investigations in section 3 the data and methodology adopted to study the influence of the approach angle on storm surge behaviour along the concave coast are elucidated in section 4 further in section 5 validation of the water levels is carried out followed by an in depth analysis to evaluate the surge behaviour due to the different approach angle on the selected locations along the concave coast is carried out the summary and conclusion derived from the analysis are presented in section 6 2 numerical model the numerical simulations were carried out using the advanced circulation adcirc model developed by luettich and westerink 1991 adcirc is a two dimensional depth integrated 2ddi shallow water equation model based on hydrostatic pressure and boussinesq approximation that solves the equation of motion considering the effect of coriolis force it uses the finite element method fem for spatial discretisation and finite difference method fdm for temporal advancement generalised wave continuity equation gwce and 2d

purpose coastline stretch of approximately 470 km along the northern tamil nadu fig 2 between ambuli river mouth and pulicat lake located on the southern tip of the andhra pradesh coast was considered the model domain fig 2 is extended 400 km offshore from this coastline to account for a significant phase of cyclone propagation that can capture the primary storm surge blain et al 1994 the land boundary of the domain is defined using a wetting and drying scheme and the ocean boundary is defined using open boundary conditions fig 2 the model domain is discretised with unstructured triangular mesh with mesh size varying bhaskaran et al 2014 2013 blain et al 1998 from 100 m near mainland boundary to 20 km along ocean boundary fig 2 this selection is sufficient to represent the coastline shape as well as the continental shelf and slope the discretised model domain comprises of 197 181 elements and 101 382 nodal points the discretised domain is imposed with 30 arc second bathymetry data obtained from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco fig 3 depicts the interpolated bathymetry contours representing the continental shelves the continental shelf width along the coast in the model domain varied from 170 km along the southern part to 35 km along the northern part of the coast considered fig 3 however the narrowest shelf width is observed in the middle of the coastal stretch the numerical simulations are performed using a time step of 2 s satisfying the cfl stability criteria the wetting and drying scheme is used with a cutoff water depth of 0 05 m and cutoff velocity of 0 05 m s to account the flooding and drying of low lying areas within the domain the model uses the element removal wetting drying scheme to enhance computational efficiency the model is first set up for simulating tide by specifying tidal elevations along the open boundary bhaskaran et al 2014 reported that major tidal constituents k1 m2 n2 o1 p1 s2 are sufficient to reproduce the tidal elevations along the tamil nadu coast these major tidal constituents are obtained from the le provost provost et al 1998 tidal database the bottom friction is computed based on a hybrid relation with the recommended coefficients set to values as 1 10 and 1 3 as the break depth hbreak asymptotic approach factor θ and increase friction factor λ respectively the weighting factor for the gwce adopted a value 0 01 as recommended by murray 2003 and the lateral eddy viscosity chosen for the study is 5 m2 s the model run is extended for four days further following initial spin up that considers the cyclone propagation in the domain from the tide alone simulation tidal elevations and velocities at every node point at given time steps are obtained but for the present study these values are extracted at the selected locations at 1 h interval these locations also included ennore and nagapattinam where the tide gauge measurements were available during the thane cyclone the results of this tide alone simulation results were later subtracted from the storm tide results to obtain the corresponding storm surge component that is solely due to the cyclonic wind and pressure drop the storm tide refers to the total water levels computed due to the combined forcing of tide and cyclonic forcing cyclonic wind and pressure the tide and surge simulation started on 25th december 2011 well before the initiation of thane cyclonic storm 26th december keeping ample time for a model spin up the coupled tide surge simulations were carried out by forcing the tidal elevations at the open boundary and cyclonic wind field and pressure over the surface of the computational domain the cyclonic wind field and the pressure are estimated using the dynamic asymmetric holland s wind formulation bao et al 2006 holland 1980 xie et al 2006 4 data and methodology storm characteristics like size forward speed intensity and approach angle of the cyclone alter the storm surge behaviour at coastal water the storm parameters of thane cyclone considered for the present study were obtained from the best tracks of the joint typhoon warning centre jtwc this cyclone approached the concave coast of north tamil nadu at an angle of 75 the approach angle is measured in the counter clockwise direction the direction of cyclone movement in the northern hemisphere from the cyclone track to the north of the coastline as the considered landfall point is inside a concave coastline to measure the approach angle a hypothetical coastline is constructed by drawing a tangent at the landfall point parallel to the coast the numerical experiments are conducted by changing the approach angle of the cyclones keeping other storm parameters constant including the landfall point the landfall time coincided with low tide conditions with the possibility of higher surge tide interaction the scope of the present study is limited to obtain the storm surge response along the north tamil nadu coast due to varying approach angle of the cyclone we have selected approaching angles at 45 75 90 105 and 135 such that the continental shelf and slope of angles at 75 90 and 105 are almost similar to each other as well the 45 and 135 represents the approach angle equidistant towards the north and south of the perpendicular track considered the synthetic cyclone tracks are obtained for different approach angles 45 75 90 105 and 135 by keeping the landfall point and storm parameters like the wind intensity pressure drop and radius of the cyclones same as that of thane cyclone the cyclones are numbered in the order of appearance from the north as depicted in fig 4 a thus cyclone 1 makes landfall at an angle of 45 with respect to the coast cyclone 2 corresponds to the thane cyclone at an angle 75 and cyclone 3 made landfall perpendicular 90 to the coast cyclone 4 and cyclone 5 made an angle of 105 and 135 respectively fig 4 b shows bathymetry profiles representing the continental shelf and slope along the different cyclone paths considered for the study with each transect representing the corresponding bathymetry profile along the cyclone path i e transect 1 refers to the bathymetry profile of cyclone 1 table 2 summarises details of the cyclones considered for the study with their angles of approach to the coast and their corresponding transects and continental slope all simulations are performed using adcirc for a total of five days with a preceding spin up of the model the continental shelf and slope profile along with which the cyclone advances are shown in fig 4 b it could be observed continental slope profiles of cyclones with approach angle 45 and 135 shows a significant variation while for the rest of the cyclones the slope was closer to each other storm surge hydrodynamics owing to these different approach angle of cyclone is carried out by estimating the surge height and residual currents they are obtained by subtracting the corresponding tidal components from water levels and currents of combined forcing of tide and storm the spatial distribution of the maximum water level and maximum depth average currents would provide an understanding of the coastal flooding and the tide surge interaction under the influence of different approach angles in the present study surge responses could be affected by the shelf profile as well as the coastal geometry the southern portion of the model domain has a wider continental shelf domain and a flatter slope that narrows down towards the midsection with steeper slopes whereas the northern part of the coast has a board shelf with a steep slope we analyse the influence of shelf profile and coastal geometry on storm surge behaviour by studying the flux movement inside the concave coast 5 results and discussion confidence in the modelling is gained by validating the water levels during thane cyclone with the tide gauge observations at ennore and nagapattinam further numerical experiments with different approach angles of thane cyclone were performed for understanding the effect of these approach angles the sensitivity of the surge heights at landfall time at selected coastal locations followed by the spatial variation of the maximum water levels were investigated temporal variation of the surge heights also provided a better understanding of the surge hydrodynamics the surge behaviour in term of the depth averaged currents was explored with the spatial variation of the maximum depth averaged currents and temporal variation of the residual currents at the selected coastal location thereafter to study the contribution of the surge response due to the concave coast the flux movement inside this region is also studied a detailed description of these analyses is discussed in the subsequent sections 5 1 validation of water levels the numerical model is validated by comparing the water levels from the model with observations available at ennore and nagapattinam tide gauge stations shown in fig 3 during thane cyclone the time series of the modelled water levels at ennore and the observed water level at ennore tide gauge station is shown in fig 5 a it can be seen that the computed water levels that represent the storm tide are in good agreement with the observed water levels with a root mean square error rmse value of 0 15 m and correlation coefficient cc of 0 97 similarly the water levels computed at nagapattinam were also in good agreement with the observed water levels with high correlation coefficient cc of 0 94 and rsme of 0 093 m fig 5 c the residual water levels obtained at ennore and nagapattinam from model and the tide gauge record are shown in fig 5 b and d the surge components computed by the models at both the locations do not match with the observed values this is expected as the locations are away from the cyclone track where waves might dominate over the surge however the general trend of the surge is noticed in the model results the black lines with arrow in the figures mark the landfall time it is to be noted that as the study did not attempt to validate the currents as the observations available during thane cyclone provided surface currents while the adcirc model provides us a depth averaged current which result in a lesser value however the magnitude of the peak currents was compared with the model depth averaged peak currents during thane cyclone and both these current were found to be 1 m s as was reported in bhaskaran et al 2013 significant wave characteristics were beyond the scope of the study hence were not validated for the present study wind field for the presents study was determined from parametric wind model asymmetric holland model and it was ensured that for the storm characteristics remain the same for all the cyclones except the direction the storm approaches the coast 5 2 surge height and maximum water elevation the model computes the total water level by solving the generalised wave continuity equation the storm surge characteristics at the coastal regions are affected by its interaction with the coastal features in a concave coastal area higher surge heights are expected due to the convergence of energy and accumulation of large volume of water into the coast to study the storm surge characteristics along the coast few coastal locations are chosen as shown in fig 6 at landfall time the storm surge brings in maximum impact along the coast due to the closeness of the cyclone centre to the land the computed surge heights at the landfall time due to cyclones approaching from different angles are plotted as shown in fig 7 a e in the northern hemisphere due to the counter clockwise circulation of the cyclone water is pushed onshore on the right side of the cyclone track that results in positive storm surge while on the left side it pushes the water away into the sea that results in a negative lower surge fig 7 a e shows that at the time of landfall a lower positive surge is noted at poochimedu and a negative surge at parangipettai poochimedu is located inside concave shape coastal geometry that would have resulted in accumulation whereas parangipettai is away from the landfall point where a faster dissipation of energy occurs the computed maximum surge height 0 65 m for all the cyclones is recorded at thazhamkuda at the landfall time with highest surge height for cyclone 2 when the cyclone made an oblique angle 75 to the coast and not when it is perpendicular the magnitude of surge heights are found to be reducing for cyclones 1 0 53 m 3 0 61 m 4 0 63 m and 5 0 60 m with a reduction by 18 5 6 3 and 7 6 respectively concerning the surge height observed by cyclone 2 at landfall time the maximum negative surge is observed at vedaranyam for cyclone 1 0 17 m followed by cyclone 2 0 1 m 4 0 07 m 5 0 06 m and 3 0 05 m on the right of landfall point locations north of landfall point the surge heights are expected to reduce as we move away from the landfall point however on the contrary the surge height at kuilapalayam is higher than at puducherry the change in the surge behaviour could be due to the influence of coastal geometry for further investigation of storm surge characteristics along the coastal locations a time series analysis of the surge height levels is carried out for cyclones of different approach angle as shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows the temporal variation of the surge heights at various coastal locations due to different synthetic cyclones the red arrow shows the landfall time i e 30th december 2011 0100 utc the variability in storm surge characteristics due to approach angles of the cyclone is investigated using the surge height during the storm propagation it can be observed from fig 8 that the surge heights are varying at each coastal location based on the cyclones approach angle where the wind intensity pressure variations translation speed and radius of wind field are same it could be observed that for locations ennore to odiyur peak surge is maximum for cyclone 1 followed by cyclones 2 3 4 and 5 while for locations poompuhar to vedaranyam the peak surge is maximum for cyclone 5 followed by 4 3 2 and 1 in the order of the proximity of the cyclone tracks to these locations it could be seen that the peak surge is almost double for cyclone 1 and cyclone 5 when compared to cyclone 2 and 4 respectively although the continental slope and shelf for cyclone 2 and 3 are similar fig 4 b the peak surge height for cyclone 2 is approximately 20 more than cyclone 3 for coastal locations from ennore to odiyur at poompuhar peak surge height due to cyclone 2 is about 20 less than that of cyclone 3 whereas at nagapattinam to vedaranyam the surge height shows very less variability nonlinear variation in the peak surge heights is observed in the concave coastal geometry at locations kuilapalayam to parangipettai at kuilapalayam and puducherry the maximum surge height is observed for cyclone 1 0 54 m and 0 48 m followed by 3 0 49 m and 0 44 m 2 0 47 m and 0 43 m 5 0 44 m and 0 39 m and 4 0 39 m and 0 35 m at thazhamkuda peak surge is recorded at landfall time with maximum value for cyclone 2 followed by cyclones 4 3 5 and 1 at poochimedu the peak surge is recorded few hours before the landfall time in case of cyclones 5 4 and 3 whereas for cyclones 2 and 1 peak surge are observed after landfall time with a higher magnitude for cyclone 1 this variability in the peak surge occurrence is mainly due to the non linear interaction of the storm surge with continental slope shelf and coastal geometry besides storm surge height also depends on the proximity of the cyclone centre to the coastal locations defined by its approach angle the highest peak surge among the different cyclones considered in the study is observed at kalpakkam 6 h before landfall of cyclone 1 prior to landfall surge heights due to cyclone 1 show negative values along the coastal locations from kuilapalayam to vedaranyam fig 8 g o this could be due to the escape of large mass of water on the left side of the cyclone track as the wind direction is seaward pulling the mass of water towards the sea shown in fig 9 a due to the above reason a very low negative surge is recorded at locations near landfall until the cyclone 1 comes very close to landfall the surge due to cyclone 1 ramps up rapidly just before landfall at these locations irrespective of the approach angle at landfall time the maximum surge height is found to be at thazhamkuda location close to the landfall we observe in fig 8 o cyclone 5 shows a positive surge just prior to landfalling while other approach angles show a negative surge at vedaranyam the variability in the surge height at vedaranyam may be attributable to the approach angle of the cyclone fig 9 b shows the position of the cyclone centre and the wind motion that resulted in a positive surge at vedaranyam the cyclone eye is located right in front of vedaranyam and the coastal geometry restricting the flow to escape into sea resulting in a positive surge however once the cyclone moves north the same location records negative surge fig 8 o due to the seaward wind motion abating the surge as the flow escapes through the southern side although the locations puducherry to poompuhar fig 8 h l in the concave region of the coast share a similar continental slope and shelf width the varying surge might be due to the concave coastal geometry that resulted in a higher surge in the central region the coastal flooding due to storm surge is of utmost interest to the coastal community but the scientific understanding needs to know the evolution of surge as the cyclone propagates the maximum water elevation mwe recorded within the domain is an important parameter to understand the physical process that in turn affects the coastal flooding the mwe is the highest water level recorded at each node during the entire simulation i e this is the envelope of peak water level at every grid spatial variation of mwe computed for tide and cyclone 1 to 5 are shown in fig 10 a f where fig 10 a shows the mwe of tide alone simulation fig 10 b f shows the envelope of peak water levels due to the combined wind and tide forcing that corresponds to maximum storm tide we observe in fig 5 that landfall time of cyclone coincided with the ebbing tide that could have resulted in lowering of the maximum storm tide observed closer to landfall point table 3 gives us the location of the highest mwe with their respective magnitude and time lag with respect to the landfall time for different cyclones the time lag of approximately 6 h corresponds to flood tide as the east coast of india experiences semidiurnal tidal cycle in the deep waters as it can be observed in the spatial plots of fig 10 b f the maximum storm tide are concentrated along cyclone track and their behaviour is similar to each other but as it approaches the shallower regions their behaviour is influenced by the continental slope and shelf followed by the effect of coastal geometry in fig 10 b f the appearance of the first light blue color contour elliptical in shape in deep water region along the cyclone track shows the rise in water level as a result of the combined effect of high tide as well as intensity of cyclone increased to that of very severe cyclonic storm about 46 m s fig 10 shows cyclone 1 shown in fig 10 b with a lesser approach angle to the coast has the highest mwe though the propagation of storm surge for cyclone 1 is on a steeper slope see fig 4 b its interaction with the coastal geometry is higher that resulted in a higher mwe the envelope of mwe for cyclone 1 2 and 3 was found to be similar though their magnitude reduced as the approach angle to the coast increased the highest mwe for cyclone 1 2 and 3 is concentrated along the inflexion point where the coastal geometry changes from concave to convex shape located between odiyur and kalpakkam in fig 6 though the continental shelf and slope for cyclone 2 and 3 were similar to that of cyclone 4 as seen in fig 4 b the envelope of peak storm tide is elsewhere for cyclone 4 shown in fig 10 e this change is solely due to the influence of the approach angle of the cyclone with the coastline as the other influencing parameters for storm surge remains the same the storm tide for the cyclone 5 propagates towards the coast interacts with a gentle slope refer fig 4 b higher approach angle as well as broader coastal shelf on the left of cyclone track that resulted in a larger envelope of peak storm tide as seen in fig 10 f than that observed for cyclone 4 when the approach angle of the cyclone changes to an obtuse angle the area where the coastal flooding occurs also changes even though an entrapment of the water is expected inside the concave coast during the propagation of cyclone 4 and 5 larger unobstructed area on the right quadrant of cyclone centre allows the water to escape northward thereby reducing the area of the peak storm tide near to the landfall region however these can cause flooding along the low lying area located far north of the landfall point as can be observed here for cyclone 4 and 5 the highest mwe has decreased to about 36 42 52 and 45 for cyclone 2 cyclone 3 cyclone 4 and cyclone 5 respectively compared to that of the cyclone 1 thus the highest mwe is observed when the cyclone incidents at an oblique angle closer to the coast and not at the perpendicular direction at landfall time as observed in fig 8 irrespective of the angle of approach the peak surge height is observed near to the landfall point near thazhamkuda and their magnitude is almost closer to each other while the temporal variation of the surge height fig 9 as well as the spatial plot fig 10 depicting the mwe shows that the coastal flooding occurs elsewhere along the coast not at the landfall point before cyclone landfalling from the tide gauge observations at ennore shown in fig 5 a we see that landfall time coincides with low tide whereas the high mwe as shown in table 3 and peak surge heights fig 9 were recorded during high tide indicating a stronger tide surge interaction during high tide among all the cyclones cyclone 1 has produced the highest peak surge and the highest mwe as this approached the coast with a lower angle of incidence to the land it could be summarised that inside a concave coast when cyclone centre is closer to coast the peak surge occurs before landfall due to higher interaction of the storm surge with coastal geometry continental shelf and tide higher surge is observed when cyclones approach at an oblique angle to the coast rather than at perpendicular at locations inside the concave shaped coast their peak surge heights showed a nonlinear variation higher positive surge is observed when right quadrant of the cyclone with maximum onshore winds are closer to land and higher negative surge is observed when the left quadrant of the cyclone with maximum offshore winds are closer to land in addition the maximum storm tide occurred prior to the landfall coincided with high tide which is also reported by srinivasa kumar et al 2015 thus a cyclone approaching with a lesser angle to coast could experience a higher variability in surge height due to the influence of complex coastal features such as continental slope shelf as well as coastal geometry 5 3 depth averaged currents the depth averaged currents are computed at each node by solving the momentum equations using adcirc fig 11 a f depict the spatial variation of maximum depth average current in the domain fig 11 a shows the maximum depth average current due to tide only forcing here current velocities are less than 0 5 m s while the maximum depth averaged currents due to the combined effect of tide and cyclonic wind forcing approaching at five different angles shown in fig 11 b f depicts an increased current speed along the nearshore regions highest current speed 2 3 m s is found to be due to cyclone 1 at odiyur as the cyclone track moves away from the coast in case of cyclones 2 3 and 4 the maximum currents are concentrated along the concave shaped coastal geometry as seen in fig 11 c e cyclone 5 with highest incident angleand cyclone centre closer to the southern coast along a wide and mild continental slope fig 4 b has resulted in maximum currents on left side of the cyclone track as shown in fig 11 f thus fig 11 demonstrates that based on the approach angle of the cyclone to the coast the spatial extent of the peak coastal currents due to storm surge varies time series analyses of depth averaged residual currents currents due to storm tide currents due to tide alone at the selected coastal locations are carried out for further understanding of the variation in the storm surge currents fig 12 shows the temporal variation of residual currents at selected locations due to different approach angles of the cyclone though the magnitude of the tide only currents are much lower compared to the combined tide surge currents the residual currents are analyzed for understanding the influence of currents due to the storm the red arrow in fig 12 shows the landfall time fig 12 shows dual peaks for residual currents with the maximum peak current before landfalling during flood tide which reduces during the landfall and then peaks up to a lesser intensity after landfalling however the magnitude and time of occurrence of the maximum current speed depend on the approach angle of the cyclone with the coast the maximum peak residual current is found at puducherry for cyclone 1 that occurred 2 h before landfall fig 12 h the maximum current at locations north of the landfall point is higher for cyclone 1 compared to other cyclones this shows the accumulation of energy between the cyclone track and coast resulting in higher surge and currents fig 12 a h cyclone 5 shows similar features but opposite trend i e with higher current speed at southern points and lower current speed at northern points with respect to the landfall location current speeds are found to be oscillating at vedaranyam for all the cyclones this may be due to the return currents from the island nation sri lanka located on its south the current speed at locations along the concave region fig 12 e j kalpakkam to poochimedu are found to be higher irrespective of the cyclones angle of approach the storm surge generated currents is also higher along the concave shaped coast 5 4 effect of coastal geometry around landfall the landfall point for all cyclones is located inside the concave shaped coastal geometry as shown in fig 13 in addition to cyclones angle of incidence the variations in the surge height and currents are due to the combined effect of the coastal geometry as well as change in the shelf width and slope the response of the surge propagation due to different approach angles of the cyclone on the concave shaped coast is investigated by computing the flux movement in and out of the cross section ab represented as the dashed line in fig 13 the normal component of velocity acting at different nodal points along ab are computed to obtain the flux q at the points the net flux q through the cross section is computed by integrating the flux at all the nodal points along cross section ab the flux due to the coupled storm surge and tide as well as due to the tide alone are computed the residual flux is obtained by taking the difference between fluxes computed from storm tide and tide the time series plot of the net residual flux storm tide flux tidal flux through cross section ab is as shown in fig 14 the direction of flux movement is considered positive towards land and negative towards sea variation in the behaviour of the residual flux could be seen from fig 14 higher fluctuations in the residual flux were found for the cyclones with a lesser approach angle as well as for higher approach angle to the coastline i e for cyclone 1 and 5 than those which approach with intermediate angles fig 14 shows at instant 1 a sudden negative net residual flux for cyclone 5 unlike other cyclones this negative flux in cyclone 5 further reverses and a higher positive flux is found as marked by instant 2 similarly cyclone 1 behaves differently from the other cyclones with a lower magnitude of net residual flux as the cyclones moved closer to the land at instant 3 large fluctuations in net residual flux is noticed however the highest net residual flux is recorded for cyclone 4 followed by cyclone 2 cyclone 3 cyclone 1 and cyclone 5 the maximum positive net residual flux is recorded during the landfall time this is preceeded instant 4 and followed instant 6 by two lower net residual flux further investigation on these fluctuating behaviour of the net residual flux at selected instants 1 6 as shown in fig 14 are carried out by plotting the residual flux at various locations along the cross section ab and is as shown in fig 15 a f in fig 15 a f the red arrow shows the point about which change in the direction of flux takes place this is located at a distance of 69 km from a marked as pivot in fig 13 for all the cyclones it could be noticed that for instants 1 3 in fig 15 a c the flux pattern is similar to each other with some variation in the magnitude of the residual flux although the variation of the flux seems to be similar across the cross section the cumulative net residual flux due to cyclone 5 along ab is negative as seen in fig 14 this indicates a reduction in the surge as the flux is moving out of the zone variation in the residual flux pattern is noticed for cyclone 1 at most of the instants which can be attributed to the sudden change in the coastal geometry at a shown in fig 13 that restricted the flow movement into the cross section ab when approached at smaller angle from the north of the coastline though cyclone 5 could have resulted in a similar behaviour due to the sudden change in the coastal geometry at b the positive flux movement is not restricted by the coastal geometry resulting in no amplification of the flux movement further to understand the effect of coastal geometry on surge behaviour the maximum surge heights inside the concave shaped coast is closely analyzed along with the net flux movement along the cross section ab and time series plot for the same is shown in fig 16 a e the correlation coefficients cc between residual flux and the surge height is estimated and presented the cc for cyclone 1 cyclone 2 cyclone 3 cyclone 4 and cyclone 5 are found to be 0 76 0 84 0 77 0 69 and 0 4 respectively similarly the statistical significance is obtained by computing the p value for each of the cyclone and it was found to be much less than 0 001 it can be clearly stated that there exists a statistically highly significant positive correlation between the surge heights at the coastal location and the flux movement across the cross section ab this indicates that the influence of the flux movement inside the concave coast results in increasing the surge height it is also noticed that inside the concave coast the surge heights for all the cyclones are similar except cyclone 1 where the peak surge remained stationary for few hours because of the restrained flow movement towards land the maximum surge height inside the concave coast was lesser for cyclone 1 when compared to other cyclones in another study by sahoo and bhaskaran 2017 along the odisha coast it was reported the closer proximity of the cyclone centre to land would result in an increase surge height which was not the case with this concave coast of tamil nadu we found the maximum storm surge inside a concave coast occurs for cyclones with an approach angle of 75 this is mainly because that such angle provides enough space on the right side of the cyclone to allow the flux to enter the concave shaped coast and still constrains the out flow of flux resulting in amplifying the surge height thus it is found that the combined effect of the cyclones approach angle and the coastal geometry plays major role in resultant surge height 6 conclusions storm surge characteristics of cyclones making landfall inside a concave coast with varying incident angle were investigated as the cyclone approached the coast from different direction the varying coastal bathymetry results in variation of continental slope and shelf along which the storm surge propagate into the coast the present study reinstates from the observations that the variability in peak surge occurrence is due to the non linear interaction of the storm surge with continental slope shelf and coastal geometry in addition storm surge height also depends on the proximity of the cyclone centre to the coastline the surge heights are found to be higher at locations outside concave shaped coast north of the landfall point when cyclones approach at 45 followed by 75 90 105 and 135 similarly the peak surge is higher at the locations outside concave shaped coast south of the landfall point for cyclone approaching at 135 followed by 105 90 and 45 overall it can be concluded that the surge levels are higher at locations nearest to the cyclone track for cyclones approaching with an oblique angle variation of about 20 in the peak surge height were found due to change in the approach angle of cyclone from 75 to 90 for which the continental shelf and slope were found to be similar to each other however it could be discerned that the flux movement into the concave shaped coast governs the surge height when the landfall point is within a concave coastal geometry although the locations in the concave shape share a similar continental slope and shelf width they record varying surge due to its shape with higher surge in the central region the maximum surge height at the landfall point located within concave shaped coast is recorded for 75 angle of approach and a reduction in surge height by 3 5 5 9 7 5 and 18 is recorded for angles of approach of 105 90 135 and 45 respectively maximum negative surge at landfall is found at a location outside the concave coastline when a cyclone approached closer to the coast 45 the maximum negative surge at landfall time in the descending order of surge magnitude are observed when cyclone incidents at 45 75 105 135 and 90 the spatial variation of the maximum water elevation mwe showed that behaviour of the storm tide interaction in deep water for different angle of approaches of cyclones was similar to each other while in shallow water and along the coast it is influenced by the continental slope shelf and coastal geometry the highest mwe is found at the inflexion point for all the cyclones during high tide and before landfall the highest mwe is decreased by about 36 for 75 42 for 90 52 for 105 and 45 for 135 with respect to highest mwe for 45 maximum depth averaged currents are noticed along the nearshore region the currents are stronger on its right side of landfall location when the cyclone approached at 45 angle whereas for the cyclone approaching at 135 currents are stronger on both sides of the landfall point the highest variability in residual currents was at the coastal locations inside the concave shaped coast the effect of concave shaped geometry is further examined by investigating the flux movement into the concave shaped coastal geometry a positive correlation is obtained between the flux movement and maximum surge height inside the concave coast signifying the flux movement contribution to higher surge height however when the cyclone approaches the concave shaped coastal it is found that the net flux movement is restricted on its right of cyclone track resulting in the peak surge to remain entrapped for few hours for a smaller approach angle of the cyclone thus maximum surge inside the concave coast for cyclone making landfall inside the concave coast occurs when the approach angle is 75 followed by 105 thus it could be concluded that the combined effect of the approach angle of the cyclone and the coastal geometry significantly contributes to nonlinear surge behaviour at locations inside a concave coast for the cyclones making landfall inside the concave shaped coast

22408,the approach angle of a cyclone in a coastal location plays a significant role while considering the worst case surge scenarios for coastal vulnerability studies the study focuses on the sensitivity of the approach angle on the tide surge interaction in a narrow continental shelf and concave coastal geometry to study the storm surge hydrodynamics we have performed simulations using the advanced circulation adcirc model considering thane cyclone by varying its angle of approach we investigated the variability in the storm surge behaviour within the concave coast by computing the net flux movement the highest surge amplitudes and highest storm tide occurred at an inflexion point and their magnitude varied based on the proximity of the cyclone track to the shore we found that at the landfall point the maximum surge height is for an approach angle of 75 then for 105 and the least for 45 the study also shows that the peak surge attributes under go a higher variability inside a concave coast even for those cyclone tracks on a similar shelf width and slopes a statistically highly significant positive correlation exists between the flux movement inside the concave coast and the surge height keywords cyclone storm surge approach angle concave coast continental shelf and slope coastal hydrodynamics 1 introduction the tropical cyclones originated in the bay of bengal bob and landfalling along the east coast of india have a tremendous socio economic impact on coastal resilience while landfalling the cyclone induced storm surge impact varies diversely along the coast depending on various factors the intensity of the cyclone pressure drop at the centre forward speed size of the cyclone slope and width of the continental shelf angle of approach and coastal geometry are some of the factors contributing to the storm surge characteristics and impact along the coast resio and westerink 2008 the national hurricane centre nhc a division of the national weather services of the united states generalises that higher storm surge is observed for a cyclone approaching perpendicular to the coast however the impact becomes worse depending on the local geographical features of the shore and approach angle of the cyclone several studies report the influence of various factors that affect storm surge characteristics the storm surge could vary up to 30 based on different storm size for a given intensity of cyclone irish et al 2008 rego and li 2009 reported that the storm s forward motion could result in higher flood volumes for a slow moving hurricane than a fast moving hurricane horsburgh and wilson 2007 as well as rego and li 2010 observed that highest nonlinear tide surge interaction takes place when a cyclone landfall at low tide with the mid ebb or mid flood scenario zhang 2012 conducted numerical experiments on a straight coastline with constant bathymetry and found that the approach angle and forward speed has a significant effect on storm surge zou et al 2013 found from their study that a slight shift in the storm track could result in large deviations in the predicted wave heights sensitivity of surge predictions to forecast uncertainties in the storm path and strength of hurricane arthur was performed by cyriac et al 2018 to conclude that the predicted water levels were sensitive to the cyclone track and the resulted water level response was non linear based on the changes in the storm strength and path storm surge in bob was first modelled by das 1972 and das et al 1974 by solving the linear shallow water long wave equations using finite difference method the study computed the storm surge due to bangladesh cyclone of 1970 that resulted in an overestimation in the surge amplitude as result of the uncertainities in the frictional stress as well as superposition of the astronomical tides johns and ali 1980 showed that a non linear surge model is necessary to understand the nature of tide surge interaction in shallow water adcirc model is one among the state of the art models based on the finite element method that is capable of representing the tide surge non linear interaction in the stand alone mode luettich et al 1992 the tide surge and wave interaction can be simulated using the coupled adcirc swan model dietrich et al 2012 presently this model is being used for forecasting the storm surge as well as to study the tide surge and wave interaction along the indian coast bhaskaran et al 2013 murty et al 2016 2014 nayak and bhaskaran 2013 rao et al 2013 tide surge interaction tide surge and wave interaction along the indian coast have been addressed by various researchers like gayathri et al 2016 poulose et al 2017 sahoo and bhaskaran 2017 sebastian and behera 2018 poulose et al 2017 studied the impact of varying continental shelf on the tide surge and wave interaction using a hypothetical linearly varying continental shelf along the west coast of india it was observed that with an increase in shelf width of about 10 km the peak surge height increased to about 12 cm nevertheless in the real world the varying shelf and slope profiles along with the complex coastal geometry results in a different surge behaviour altogether sebastian and behera 2018 carried out a preliminary investigation of storm surge behaviour due to cyclones helen and laila along the krishna godavari basin with complex coastal features the study observed that even though two storms made landfall at nearby locations the higher surge was along the bays and higher currents at the headlands the intensity of helen was 10 higher than laila still the magnitude of the peak surge characteristics remained the same for both the study clearly shows the influence of coastal geometry on the storm surge characteristics during these cyclones india has a coastline stretch of about 7517 km that includes both the mainland and island with the varying continental shelf and coastal geometry sanil kumar et al 2006 thus the response of storm surge could differ from coast to coast prediction of future storm characteristics based on historical data is highly uncertain the india meteorological department imd classifies tropical cyclones based on 3 min maximum sustained winds and are referred as cyclonic storm cs 17 5 24 5 m s severe cyclonic storm scs 24 5 32 5 m s very severe cyclonic storm vscs 32 5 46 m s extremely severe cyclonic storm escs 46 61 5 m s and super cyclonic storm sucs 61 5 m s an observation of past tropical cyclone 1990 2016 tracks from imd cyclone e atlas shows that no two cyclones were similar in characteristics and 60 of landfalling angles were not perpendicular to the coast fig 1 shows selected past cyclone tracks along the indian coast whose approach angles varied from almost parallel to perpendicular to the coast the approach angle of the cyclone is the angle between the cyclone track and the coastline on the right of the landfall which is on the north for this study the details category duration and approach angle of the cyclones shown in fig 1 are given in table 1 sahoo and bhaskaran 2017 evaluated the impact of approach angles 40 80 90 and 120 of cyclones on storm surge and inundation along odisha coast where a broad and shallow shelf and concluded that a closer proximity of the cyclone centre to the coastline increases the storm surge height along the coast however the southern part of the east coast of india has narrow and deeper continental shelves unlike the odisha coast also the southernmost part of the east coast of india is shadowed by sri lanka thus the behaviour of similar storm surge could be different along the southern part of the east coast of india i e tamil nadu coast tamil nadu coast is a micro tidal region frequently affected by cyclones with high intensity and different angle of approach although studies have been carried out to investigate the impact of cyclones landfall along tamil nadu coast bhaskaran et al 2014 2013 chittibabu et al 2002 nayak and bhaskaran 2013 rao et al 2013 srinivas et al 2012 no investigation on the effect of approach angles of cyclone on the storm surge and the underlying physics is reported so far as past studies on the approach angle have revealed that the storm surge hydrodynamics are site specific hence this study aims to investigate and understand the response of storm surge inside a concave coast under the influence of different approach angles of the cyclone thane cyclone shown in fig 1 a vscs with a maximum sustained wind intensity of about 46 m s on 29th december 2011 made landfall along a concave coast of tamil nadu with an approach angle of 75 thane cyclone made landfall on 30th december 2011 0100 utc during a low tide condition with maximum wind speed of about 33 m s a storm surge of about 1 m at the time of landfall was reported that inundated the low lying coastal regions of cuddalore pondicherry and villupuram bhaskaran et al 2013 the landfall point of thane cyclone located inside the concave coastal geometry is expected to generate high surge due to the convergence of energy also the thane cyclone with its landfall time coinciding with low tide condition has the possibility of higher surge tide interaction and thus considered for the present study the paper is organised as follows a short description about the adcirc model used for conducting numerical experiments is detailed in section 2 followed by detailed description about the model set up and initialisation used for the numerical investigations in section 3 the data and methodology adopted to study the influence of the approach angle on storm surge behaviour along the concave coast are elucidated in section 4 further in section 5 validation of the water levels is carried out followed by an in depth analysis to evaluate the surge behaviour due to the different approach angle on the selected locations along the concave coast is carried out the summary and conclusion derived from the analysis are presented in section 6 2 numerical model the numerical simulations were carried out using the advanced circulation adcirc model developed by luettich and westerink 1991 adcirc is a two dimensional depth integrated 2ddi shallow water equation model based on hydrostatic pressure and boussinesq approximation that solves the equation of motion considering

purpose coastline stretch of approximately 470 km along the northern tamil nadu fig 2 between ambuli river mouth and pulicat lake located on the southern tip of the andhra pradesh coast was considered the model domain fig 2 is extended 400 km offshore from this coastline to account for a significant phase of cyclone propagation that can capture the primary storm surge blain et al 1994 the land boundary of the domain is defined using a wetting and drying scheme and the ocean boundary is defined using open boundary conditions fig 2 the model domain is discretised with unstructured triangular mesh with mesh size varying bhaskaran et al 2014 2013 blain et al 1998 from 100 m near mainland boundary to 20 km along ocean boundary fig 2 this selection is sufficient to represent the coastline shape as well as the continental shelf and slope the discretised model domain comprises of 197 181 elements and 101 382 nodal points the discretised domain is imposed with 30 arc second bathymetry data obtained from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco fig 3 depicts the interpolated bathymetry contours representing the continental shelves the continental shelf width along the coast in the model domain varied from 170 km along the southern part to 35 km along the northern part of the coast considered fig 3 however the narrowest shelf width is observed in the middle of the coastal stretch the numerical simulations are performed using a time step of 2 s satisfying the cfl stability criteria the wetting and drying scheme is used with a cutoff water depth of 0 05 m and cutoff velocity of 0 05 m s to account the flooding and drying of low lying areas within the domain the model uses the element removal wetting drying scheme to enhance computational efficiency the model is first set up for simulating tide by specifying tidal elevations along the open boundary bhaskaran et al 2014 reported that major tidal constituents k1 m2 n2 o1 p1 s2 are sufficient to reproduce the tidal elevations along the tamil nadu coast these major tidal constituents are obtained from the le provost provost et al 1998 tidal database the bottom friction is computed based on a hybrid relation with the recommended coefficients set to values as 1 10 and 1 3 as the break depth hbreak asymptotic approach factor θ and increase friction factor λ respectively the weighting factor for the gwce adopted a value 0 01 as recommended by murray 2003 and the lateral eddy viscosity chosen for the study is 5 m2 s the model run is extended for four days further following initial spin up that considers the cyclone propagation in the domain from the tide alone simulation tidal elevations and velocities at every node point at given time steps are obtained but for the present study these values are extracted at the selected locations at 1 h interval these locations also included ennore and nagapattinam where the tide gauge measurements were available during the thane cyclone the results of this tide alone simulation results were later subtracted from the storm tide results to obtain the corresponding storm surge component that is solely due to the cyclonic wind and pressure drop the storm tide refers to the total water levels computed due to the combined forcing of tide and cyclonic forcing cyclonic wind and pressure the tide and surge simulation started on 25th december 2011 well before the initiation of thane cyclonic storm 26th december keeping ample time for a model spin up the coupled tide surge simulations were carried out by forcing the tidal elevations at the open boundary and cyclonic wind field and pressure over the surface of the computational domain the cyclonic wind field and the pressure are estimated using the dynamic asymmetric holland s wind formulation bao et al 2006 holland 1980 xie et al 2006 4 data and methodology storm characteristics like size forward speed intensity and approach angle of the cyclone alter the storm surge behaviour at coastal water the storm parameters of thane cyclone considered for the present study were obtained from the best tracks of the joint typhoon warning centre jtwc this cyclone approached the concave coast of north tamil nadu at an angle of 75 the approach angle is measured in the counter clockwise direction the direction of cyclone movement in the northern hemisphere from the cyclone track to the north of the coastline as the considered landfall point is inside a concave coastline to measure the approach angle a hypothetical coastline is constructed by drawing a tangent at the landfall point parallel to the coast the numerical experiments are conducted by changing the approach angle of the cyclones keeping other storm parameters constant including the landfall point the landfall time coincided with low tide conditions with the possibility of higher surge tide interaction the scope of the present study is limited to obtain the storm surge response along the north tamil nadu coast due to varying approach angle of the cyclone we have selected approaching angles at 45 75 90 105 and 135 such that the continental shelf and slope of angles at 75 90 and 105 are almost similar to each other as well the 45 and 135 represents the approach angle equidistant towards the north and south of the perpendicular track considered the synthetic cyclone tracks are obtained for different approach angles 45 75 90 105 and 135 by keeping the landfall point and storm parameters like the wind intensity pressure drop and radius of the cyclones same as that of thane cyclone the cyclones are numbered in the order of appearance from the north as depicted in fig 4 a thus cyclone 1 makes landfall at an angle of 45 with respect to the coast cyclone 2 corresponds to the thane cyclone at an angle 75 and cyclone 3 made landfall perpendicular 90 to the coast cyclone 4 and cyclone 5 made an angle of 105 and 135 respectively fig 4 b shows bathymetry profiles representing the continental shelf and slope along the different cyclone paths considered for the study with each transect representing the corresponding bathymetry profile along the cyclone path i e transect 1 refers to the bathymetry profile of cyclone 1 table 2 summarises details of the cyclones considered for the study with their angles of approach to the coast and their corresponding transects and continental slope all simulations are performed using adcirc for a total of five days with a preceding spin up of the model the continental shelf and slope profile along with which the cyclone advances are shown in fig 4 b it could be observed continental slope profiles of cyclones with approach angle 45 and 135 shows a significant variation while for the rest of the cyclones the slope was closer to each other storm surge hydrodynamics owing to these different approach angle of cyclone is carried out by estimating the surge height and residual currents they are obtained by subtracting the corresponding tidal components from water levels and currents of combined forcing of tide and storm the spatial distribution of the maximum water level and maximum depth average currents would provide an understanding of the coastal flooding and the tide surge interaction under the influence of different approach angles in the present study surge responses could be affected by the shelf profile as well as the coastal geometry the southern portion of the model domain has a wider continental shelf domain and a flatter slope that narrows down towards the midsection with steeper slopes whereas the northern part of the coast has a board shelf with a steep slope we analyse the influence of shelf profile and coastal geometry on storm surge behaviour by studying the flux movement inside the concave coast 5 results and discussion confidence in the modelling is gained by validating the water levels during thane cyclone with the tide gauge observations at ennore and nagapattinam further numerical experiments with different approach angles of thane cyclone were performed for understanding the effect of these approach angles the sensitivity of the surge heights at landfall time at selected coastal locations followed by the spatial variation of the maximum water levels were investigated temporal variation of the surge heights also provided a better understanding of the surge hydrodynamics the surge behaviour in term of the depth averaged currents was explored with the spatial variation of the maximum depth averaged currents and temporal variation of the residual currents at the selected coastal location thereafter to study the contribution of the surge response due to the concave coast the flux movement inside this region is also studied a detailed description of these analyses is discussed in the subsequent sections 5 1 validation of water levels the numerical model is validated by comparing the water levels from the model with observations available at ennore and nagapattinam tide gauge stations shown in fig 3 during thane cyclone the time series of the modelled water levels at ennore and the observed water level at ennore tide gauge station is shown in fig 5 a it can be seen that the computed water levels that represent the storm tide are in good agreement with the observed water levels with a root mean square error rmse value of 0 15 m and correlation coefficient cc of 0 97 similarly the water levels computed at nagapattinam were also in good agreement with the observed water levels with high correlation coefficient cc of 0 94 and rsme of 0 093 m fig 5 c the residual water levels obtained at ennore and nagapattinam from model and the tide gauge record are shown in fig 5 b and d the surge components computed by the models at both the locations do not match with the observed values this is expected as the locations are away from the cyclone track where waves might dominate over the surge however the general trend of the surge is noticed in the model results the black lines with arrow in the figures mark the landfall time it is to be noted that as the study did not attempt to validate the currents as the observations available during thane cyclone provided surface currents while the adcirc model provides us a depth averaged current which result in a lesser value however the magnitude of the peak currents was compared with the model depth averaged peak currents during thane cyclone and both these current were found to be 1 m s as was reported in bhaskaran et al 2013 significant wave characteristics were beyond the scope of the study hence were not validated for the present study wind field for the presents study was determined from parametric wind model asymmetric holland model and it was ensured that for the storm characteristics remain the same for all the cyclones except the direction the storm approaches the coast 5 2 surge height and maximum water elevation the model computes the total water level by solving the generalised wave continuity equation the storm surge characteristics at the coastal regions are affected by its interaction with the coastal features in a concave coastal area higher surge heights are expected due to the convergence of energy and accumulation of large volume of water into the coast to study the storm surge characteristics along the coast few coastal locations are chosen as shown in fig 6 at landfall time the storm surge brings in maximum impact along the coast due to the closeness of the cyclone centre to the land the computed surge heights at the landfall time due to cyclones approaching from different angles are plotted as shown in fig 7 a e in the northern hemisphere due to the counter clockwise circulation of the cyclone water is pushed onshore on the right side of the cyclone track that results in positive storm surge while on the left side it pushes the water away into the sea that results in a negative lower surge fig 7 a e shows that at the time of landfall a lower positive surge is noted at poochimedu and a negative surge at parangipettai poochimedu is located inside concave shape coastal geometry that would have resulted in accumulation whereas parangipettai is away from the landfall point where a faster dissipation of energy occurs the computed maximum surge height 0 65 m for all the cyclones is recorded at thazhamkuda at the landfall time with highest surge height for cyclone 2 when the cyclone made an oblique angle 75 to the coast and not when it is perpendicular the magnitude of surge heights are found to be reducing for cyclones 1 0 53 m 3 0 61 m 4 0 63 m and 5 0 60 m with a reduction by 18 5 6 3 and 7 6 respectively concerning the surge height observed by cyclone 2 at landfall time the maximum negative surge is observed at vedaranyam for cyclone 1 0 17 m followed by cyclone 2 0 1 m 4 0 07 m 5 0 06 m and 3 0 05 m on the right of landfall point locations north of landfall point the surge heights are expected to reduce as we move away from the landfall point however on the contrary the surge height at kuilapalayam is higher than at puducherry the change in the surge behaviour could be due to the influence of coastal geometry for further investigation of storm surge characteristics along the coastal locations a time series analysis of the surge height levels is carried out for cyclones of different approach angle as shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows the temporal variation of the surge heights at various coastal locations due to different synthetic cyclones the red arrow shows the landfall time i e 30th december 2011 0100 utc the variability in storm surge characteristics due to approach angles of the cyclone is investigated using the surge height during the storm propagation it can be observed from fig 8 that the surge heights are varying at each coastal location based on the cyclones approach angle where the wind intensity pressure variations translation speed and radius of wind field are same it could be observed that for locations ennore to odiyur peak surge is maximum for cyclone 1 followed by cyclones 2 3 4 and 5 while for locations poompuhar to vedaranyam the peak surge is maximum for cyclone 5 followed by 4 3 2 and 1 in the order of the proximity of the cyclone tracks to these locations it could be seen that the peak surge is almost double for cyclone 1 and cyclone 5 when compared to cyclone 2 and 4 respectively although the continental slope and shelf for cyclone 2 and 3 are similar fig 4 b the peak surge height for cyclone 2 is approximately 20 more than cyclone 3 for coastal locations from ennore to odiyur at poompuhar peak surge height due to cyclone 2 is about 20 less than that of cyclone 3 whereas at nagapattinam to vedaranyam the surge height shows very less variability nonlinear variation in the peak surge heights is observed in the concave coastal geometry at locations kuilapalayam to parangipettai at kuilapalayam and puducherry the maximum surge height is observed for cyclone 1 0 54 m and 0 48 m followed by 3 0 49 m and 0 44 m 2 0 47 m and 0 43 m 5 0 44 m and 0 39 m and 4 0 39 m and 0 35 m at thazhamkuda peak surge is recorded at landfall time with maximum value for cyclone 2 followed by cyclones 4 3 5 and 1 at poochimedu the peak surge is recorded few hours before the landfall time in case of cyclones 5 4 and 3 whereas for cyclones 2 and 1 peak surge are observed after landfall time with a higher magnitude for cyclone 1 this variability in the peak surge occurrence is mainly due to the non linear interaction of the storm surge with continental slope shelf and coastal geometry besides storm surge height also depends on the proximity of the cyclone centre to the coastal locations defined by its approach angle the highest peak surge among the different cyclones considered in the study is observed at kalpakkam 6 h before landfall of cyclone 1 prior to landfall surge heights due to cyclone 1 show negative values along the coastal locations from kuilapalayam to vedaranyam fig 8 g o this could be due to the escape of large mass of water on the left side of the cyclone track as the wind direction is seaward pulling the mass of water towards the sea shown in fig 9 a due to the above reason a very low negative surge is recorded at locations near landfall until the cyclone 1 comes very close to landfall the surge due to cyclone 1 ramps up rapidly just before landfall at these locations irrespective of the approach angle at landfall time the maximum surge height is found to be at thazhamkuda location close to the landfall we observe in fig 8 o cyclone 5 shows a positive surge just prior to landfalling while other approach angles show a negative surge at vedaranyam the variability in the surge height at vedaranyam may be attributable to the approach angle of the cyclone fig 9 b shows the position of the cyclone centre and the wind motion that resulted in a positive surge at vedaranyam the cyclone eye is located right in front of vedaranyam and the coastal geometry restricting the flow to escape into sea resulting in a positive surge however once the cyclone moves north the same location records negative surge fig 8 o due to the seaward wind motion abating the surge as the flow escapes through the southern side although the locations puducherry to poompuhar fig 8 h l in the concave region of the coast share a similar continental slope and shelf width the varying surge might be due to the concave coastal geometry that resulted in a higher surge in the central region the coastal flooding due to storm surge is of utmost interest to the coastal community but the scientific understanding needs to know the evolution of surge as the cyclone propagates the maximum water elevation mwe recorded within the domain is an important parameter to understand the physical process that in turn affects the coastal flooding the mwe is the highest water level recorded at each node during the entire simulation i e this is the envelope of peak water level at every grid spatial variation of mwe computed for tide and cyclone 1 to 5 are shown in fig 10 a f where fig 10 a shows the mwe of tide alone simulation fig 10 b f shows the envelope of peak water levels due to the combined wind and tide forcing that corresponds to maximum storm tide we observe in fig 5 that landfall time of cyclone coincided with the ebbing tide that could have resulted in lowering of the maximum storm tide observed closer to landfall point table 3 gives us the location of the highest mwe with their respective magnitude and time lag with respect to the landfall time for different cyclones the time lag of approximately 6 h corresponds to flood tide as the east coast of india experiences semidiurnal tidal cycle in the deep waters as it can be observed in the spatial plots of fig 10 b f the maximum storm tide are concentrated along cyclone track and their behaviour is similar to each other but as it approaches the shallower regions their behaviour is influenced by the continental slope and shelf followed by the effect of coastal geometry in fig 10 b f the appearance of the first light blue color contour elliptical in shape in deep water region along the cyclone track shows the rise in water level as a result of the combined effect of high tide as well as intensity of cyclone increased to that of very severe cyclonic storm about 46 m s fig 10 shows cyclone 1 shown in fig 10 b with a lesser approach angle to the coast has the highest mwe though the propagation of storm surge for cyclone 1 is on a steeper slope see fig 4 b its interaction with the coastal geometry is higher that resulted in a higher mwe the envelope of mwe for cyclone 1 2 and 3 was found to be similar though their magnitude reduced as the approach angle to the coast increased the highest mwe for cyclone 1 2 and 3 is concentrated along the inflexion point where the coastal geometry changes from concave to convex shape located between odiyur and kalpakkam in fig 6 though the continental shelf and slope for cyclone 2 and 3 were similar to that of cyclone 4 as seen in fig 4 b the envelope of peak storm tide is elsewhere for cyclone 4 shown in fig 10 e this change is solely due to the influence of the approach angle of the cyclone with the coastline as the other influencing parameters for storm surge remains the same the storm tide for the cyclone 5 propagates towards the coast interacts with a gentle slope refer fig 4 b higher approach angle as well as broader coastal shelf on the left of cyclone track that resulted in a larger envelope of peak storm tide as seen in fig 10 f than that observed for cyclone 4 when the approach angle of the cyclone changes to an obtuse angle the area where the coastal flooding occurs also changes even though an entrapment of the water is expected inside the concave coast during the propagation of cyclone 4 and 5 larger unobstructed area on the right quadrant of cyclone centre allows the water to escape northward thereby reducing the area of the peak storm tide near to the landfall region however these can cause flooding along the low lying area located far north of the landfall point as can be observed here for cyclone 4 and 5 the highest mwe has decreased to about 36 42 52 and 45 for cyclone 2 cyclone 3 cyclone 4 and cyclone 5 respectively compared to that of the cyclone 1 thus the highest mwe is observed when the cyclone incidents at an oblique angle closer to the coast and not at the perpendicular direction at landfall time as observed in fig 8 irrespective of the angle of approach the peak surge height is observed near to the landfall point near thazhamkuda and their magnitude is almost closer to each other while the temporal variation of the surge height fig 9 as well as the spatial plot fig 10 depicting the mwe shows that the coastal flooding occurs elsewhere along the coast not at the landfall point before cyclone landfalling from the tide gauge observations at ennore shown in fig 5 a we see that landfall time coincides with low tide whereas the high mwe as shown in table 3 and peak surge heights fig 9 were recorded during high tide indicating a stronger tide surge interaction during high tide among all the cyclones cyclone 1 has produced the highest peak surge and the highest mwe as this approached the coast with a lower angle of incidence to the land it could be summarised that inside a concave coast when cyclone centre is closer to coast the peak surge occurs before landfall due to higher interaction of the storm surge with coastal geometry continental shelf and tide higher surge is observed when cyclones approach at an oblique angle to the coast rather than at perpendicular at locations inside the concave shaped coast their peak surge heights showed a nonlinear variation higher positive surge is observed when right quadrant of the cyclone with maximum onshore winds are closer to land and higher negative surge is observed when the left quadrant of the cyclone with maximum offshore winds are closer to land in addition the maximum storm tide occurred prior to the landfall coincided with high tide which is also reported by srinivasa kumar et al 2015 thus a cyclone approaching with a lesser angle to coast could experience a higher variability in surge height due to the influence of complex coastal features such as continental slope shelf as well as coastal geometry 5 3 depth averaged currents the depth averaged currents are computed at each node by solving the momentum equations using adcirc fig 11 a f depict the spatial variation of maximum depth average current in the domain fig 11 a shows the maximum depth average current due to tide only forcing here current velocities are less than 0 5 m s while the maximum depth averaged currents due to the combined effect of tide and cyclonic wind forcing approaching at five different angles shown in fig 11 b f depicts an increased current speed along the nearshore regions highest current speed 2 3 m s is found to be due to cyclone 1 at odiyur as the cyclone track moves away from the coast in case of cyclones 2 3 and 4 the maximum currents are concentrated along the concave shaped coastal geometry as seen in fig 11 c e cyclone 5 with highest incident angleand cyclone centre closer to the southern coast along a wide and mild continental slope fig 4 b has resulted in maximum currents on left side of the cyclone track as shown in fig 11 f thus fig 11 demonstrates that based on the approach angle of the cyclone to the coast the spatial extent of the peak coastal currents due to storm surge varies time series analyses of depth averaged residual currents currents due to storm tide currents due to tide alone at the selected coastal locations are carried out for further understanding of the variation in the storm surge currents fig 12 shows the temporal variation of residual currents at selected locations due to different approach angles of the cyclone though the magnitude of the tide only currents are much lower compared to the combined tide surge currents the residual currents are analyzed for understanding the influence of currents due to the storm the red arrow in fig 12 shows the landfall time fig 12 shows dual peaks for residual currents with the maximum peak current before landfalling during flood tide which reduces during the landfall and then peaks up to a lesser intensity after landfalling however the magnitude and time of occurrence of the maximum current speed depend on the approach angle of the cyclone with the coast the maximum peak residual current is found at puducherry for cyclone 1 that occurred 2 h before landfall fig 12 h the maximum current at locations north of the landfall point is higher for cyclone 1 compared to other cyclones this shows the accumulation of energy between the cyclone track and coast resulting in higher surge and currents fig 12 a h cyclone 5 shows similar features but opposite trend i e with higher current speed at southern points and lower current speed at northern points with respect to the landfall location current speeds are found to be oscillating at vedaranyam for all the cyclones this may be due to the return currents from the island nation sri lanka located on its south the current speed at locations along the concave region fig 12 e j kalpakkam to poochimedu are found to be higher irrespective of the cyclones angle of approach the storm surge generated currents is also higher along the concave shaped coast 5 4 effect of coastal geometry around landfall the landfall point for all cyclones is located inside the concave shaped coastal geometry as shown in fig 13 in addition to cyclones angle of incidence the variations in the surge height and currents are due to the combined effect of the coastal geometry as well as change in the shelf width and slope the response of the surge propagation due to different approach angles of the cyclone on the concave shaped coast is investigated by computing the flux movement in and out of the cross section ab represented as the dashed line in fig 13 the normal component of velocity acting at different nodal points along ab are computed to obtain the flux q at the points the net flux q through the cross section is computed by integrating the flux at all the nodal points along cross section ab the flux due to the coupled storm surge and tide as well as due to the tide alone are computed the residual flux is obtained by taking the difference between fluxes computed from storm tide and tide the time series plot of the net residual flux storm tide flux tidal flux through cross section ab is as shown in fig 14 the direction of flux movement is considered positive towards land and negative towards sea variation in the behaviour of the residual flux could be seen from fig 14 higher fluctuations in the residual flux were found for the cyclones with a lesser approach angle as well as for higher approach angle to the coastline i e for cyclone 1 and 5 than those which approach with intermediate angles fig 14 shows at instant 1 a sudden negative net residual flux for cyclone 5 unlike other cyclones this negative flux in cyclone 5 further reverses and a higher positive flux is found as marked by instant 2 similarly cyclone 1 behaves differently from the other cyclones with a lower magnitude of net residual flux as the cyclones moved closer to the land at instant 3 large fluctuations in net residual flux is noticed however the highest net residual flux is recorded for cyclone 4 followed by cyclone 2 cyclone 3 cyclone 1 and cyclone 5 the maximum positive net residual flux is recorded during the landfall time this is preceeded instant 4 and followed instant 6 by two lower net residual flux further investigation on these fluctuating behaviour of the net residual flux at selected instants 1 6 as shown in fig 14 are carried out by plotting the residual flux at various locations along the cross section ab and is as shown in fig 15 a f in fig 15 a f the red arrow shows the point about which change in the direction of flux takes place this is located at a distance of 69 km from a marked as pivot in fig 13 for all the cyclones it could be noticed that for instants 1 3 in fig 15 a c the flux pattern is similar to each other with some variation in the magnitude of the residual flux although the variation of the flux seems to be similar across the cross section the cumulative net residual flux due to cyclone 5 along ab is negative as seen in fig 14 this indicates a reduction in the surge as the flux is moving out of the zone variation in the residual flux pattern is noticed for cyclone 1 at most of the instants which can be attributed to the sudden change in the coastal geometry at a shown in fig 13 that restricted the flow movement into the cross section ab when approached at smaller angle from the north of the coastline though cyclone 5 could have resulted in a similar behaviour due to the sudden change in the coastal geometry at b the positive flux movement is not restricted by the coastal geometry resulting in no amplification of the flux movement further to understand the effect of coastal geometry on surge behaviour the maximum surge heights inside the concave shaped coast is closely analyzed along with the net flux movement along the cross section ab and time series plot for the same is shown in fig 16 a e the correlation coefficients cc between residual flux and the surge height is estimated and presented the cc for cyclone 1 cyclone 2 cyclone 3 cyclone 4 and cyclone 5 are found to be 0 76 0 84 0 77 0 69 and 0 4 respectively similarly the statistical significance is obtained by computing the p value for each of the cyclone and it was found to be much less than 0 001 it can be clearly stated that there exists a statistically highly significant positive correlation between the surge heights at the coastal location and the flux movement across the cross section ab this indicates that the influence of the flux movement inside the concave coast results in increasing the surge height it is also noticed that inside the concave coast the surge heights for all the cyclones are similar except cyclone 1 where the peak surge remained stationary for few hours because of the restrained flow movement towards land the maximum surge height inside the concave coast was lesser for cyclone 1 when compared to other cyclones in another study by sahoo and bhaskaran 2017 along the odisha coast it was reported the closer proximity of the cyclone centre to land would result in an increase surge height which was not the case with this concave coast of tamil nadu we found the maximum storm surge inside a concave coast occurs for cyclones with an approach angle of 75 this is mainly because that such angle provides enough space on the right side of the cyclone to allow the flux to enter the concave shaped coast and still constrains the out flow of flux resulting in amplifying the surge height thus it is found that the combined effect of the cyclones approach angle and the coastal geometry plays major role in resultant surge height 6 conclusions storm surge characteristics of cyclones making landfall inside a concave coast with varying incident angle were investigated as the cyclone approached the coast from different direction the varying coastal bathymetry results in variation of continental slope and shelf along which the storm surge propagate into the coast the present study reinstates from the observations that the variability in peak surge occurrence is due to the non linear interaction of the storm surge with continental slope shelf and coastal geometry in addition storm surge height also depends on the proximity of the cyclone centre to the coastline the surge heights are found to be higher at locations outside concave shaped coast north of the landfall point when cyclones approach at 45 followed by 75 90 105 and 135 similarly the peak surge is higher at the locations outside concave shaped coast south of the landfall point for cyclone approaching at 135 followed by 105 90 and 45 overall it can be concluded that the surge levels are higher at locations nearest to the cyclone track for cyclones approaching with an oblique angle variation of about 20 in the peak surge height were found due to change in the approach angle of cyclone from 75 to 90 for which the continental shelf and slope were found to be similar to each other however it could be discerned that the flux movement into the concave shaped coast governs the surge height when the landfall point is within a concave coastal geometry although the locations in the concave shape share a similar continental slope and shelf width they record varying surge due to its shape with higher surge in the central region the maximum surge height at the landfall point located within concave shaped coast is recorded for 75 angle of approach and a reduction in surge height by 3 5 5 9 7 5 and 18 is recorded for angles of approach of 105 90 135 and 45 respectively maximum negative surge at landfall is found at a location outside the concave coastline when a cyclone approached closer to the coast 45 the maximum negative surge at landfall time in the descending order of surge magnitude are observed when cyclone incidents at 45 75 105 135 and 90 the spatial variation of the maximum water elevation mwe showed that behaviour of the storm tide interaction in deep water for different angle of approaches of cyclones was similar to each other while in shallow water and along the coast it is influenced by the continental slope shelf and coastal geometry the highest mwe is found at the inflexion point for all the cyclones during high tide and before landfall the highest mwe is decreased by about 36 for 75 42 for 90 52 for 105 and 45 for 135 with respect to highest mwe for 45 maximum depth averaged currents are noticed along the nearshore region the currents are stronger on its right side of landfall location when the cyclone approached at 45 angle whereas for the cyclone approaching at 135 currents are stronger on both sides of the landfall point the highest variability in residual currents was at the coastal locations inside the concave shaped coast the effect of concave shaped geometry is further examined by investigating the flux movement into the concave shaped coastal geometry a positive correlation is obtained between the flux movement and maximum surge height inside the concave coast signifying the flux movement contribution to higher surge height however when the cyclone approaches the concave shaped coastal it is found that the net flux movement is restricted on its right of cyclone track resulting in the peak surge to remain entrapped for few hours for a smaller approach angle of the cyclone thus maximum surge inside the concave coast for cyclone making landfall inside the concave coast occurs when the approach angle is 75 followed by 105 thus it could be concluded that the combined effect of the approach angle of the cyclone and the coastal geometry significantly contributes to nonlinear surge behaviour at locations inside a concave coast for the cyclones making landfall inside the concave shaped coast

22409,in korea ship collisions represent the majority of marine accidents and are substantially more likely in port areas where ship traffic is dense to improve the safe navigation of vessels the korea maritime safety audit kmsa has been conducting maritime traffic flow evaluations based on the environmental stress es model since 2009 the es model quantifies the subjective stress felt by the navigator however it does not reflect the relative bearing between ships risk assessment models using the ship domain are designed to consider the conditions of a potential encounter with a target ship and the possibility of avoidance action however even if the target ship does not invade the domain of the own ship collision may occur at the closest point of approach cpa therefore in this study the collision risk cori model which moves the existing ship domain to the cpa is applied to compare the collision risk according to the navigator s awareness of the vessel encounter conditions the results demonstrate that the cori model is a better risk assessment method than the es model because it sensitively reflects the risks due to collision avoidance action such as course alteration and speed changes keywords ship collision collision risk environmental stress es model cori collision risk model ship domain relative bearing 1 introduction in the last five years 2013 2017 ship collision

2010 this collision related research supports decision making by sailors enabling them to judge the risk according to the approach angle of the target ship from the own ship however there are many cases in which human error is caused by improper avoidance caused by taking too much time to judge the intention of the other ship grech 2002 maib 2004 risk assessment models using the ship domain can

point of approach dcpa becomes zero even if the domains of the two ships do not overlap therefore it is necessary to develop a ship domain model that can evaluate the collision situation at the closest point of approach cpa yan et al 2016 during maneuvering while maintaining the current navigational environment the vessel traffic service vts supports the information service and navigational assistance service with collision avoidance by reducing the human error of the officer on watch oow in a vessel encounter situation and ensuring that appropriate action is taken on the vessel iala 2016 imo 1997 therefore in terms of the ins information service nas navigational assistance service and tos traffic organization service which are the main functions of vts it is important to predict the ship collision risk from the perspective of the vts operator vtso and transmit the information to the relevant vessels iala 2016 it is also crucial to determine the perspective of the vtso when there is no proper or improper avoidance action thus it is necessary to develop a collision risk assessment model that improves vessel traffic safety by rapidly providing relevant information to the vessel after predicting the potential collision risk bukhari et al 2013 the korean government has implemented a korea maritime safety audit kmsa that a assesses the extent to which various port facilities in the water zone affect the safe navigation of ships and b performs maritime traffic flow evaluations for specific projects kmgl 2009 these projects involve the establishment or construction of facilities in the water zone the development of harbors ports and schemes regulated by the ministry of oceans and fisheries mof among the evaluation items of maritime traffic flow the risk items are based on the environmental stress es model inoue et al 1997 inoue 2000 yurtoren et al 2012 which is an evaluation method based on the maneuvering environment traffic environment and comprehensive environment the es model is a quantitative evaluation method based on the subjective risk level judged by the navigators which is meaningful for quantifying the stress experienced by the navigator however this method is more likely to overestimate the actual risk situation because all ships within 90 right and left of the own ship are evaluated as a stress factor therefore the risk is evaluated without considering the bearing of the encounter with the other ship in this study we introduce the collision risk cori model which is based on the vtso domain and moves the existing ship domain to the cpa position in order to compare the collision risk according to the navigator s and vtso s awareness of the vessel encounter conditions evaluation of the collision risk allows us to improve the maritime traffic flow evaluation model of kmsa which is designed from the navigators perspective the cori model evaluates the risk by considering the safe distance from domain invasion at the cpa position the allowance time for avoidance action until the collision and the potential encounter situation of the vessel at the cpa position lee and song 2017 2018 in order to evaluate the proposed cori model we apply vts ship tracking data integration of ais and radar data for crossing head on overtaking situations observed in the busan port vts control area in 2018 and compare the results with the es model results then to evaluate the potential applicability of the proposed cori model to real time collision avoidance systems around the world we perform simulations where dangerous situations are avoided through course changing if the risk exceeds a threshold based on the arbitrary cori index 2 methodology 2 1 es model the es model is divided into the environmental stresses caused by the distribution of topographical constraints around the vessel and the distribution of other ships around the own ship in this study we describe the environmental stress caused by traffic conditions which represent the quantitative risk according to the potential encounter situation between two ships inoue 2000 defined the degree of danger felt by the navigator as an environmental stress caused by traffic conditions when a vessel encounters another ship within a course range of 90 from the ship heading direction the risk perception of the ship operator was

model the cori model quantifies each risk index and calculates the risk by dividing the risk by the encounter angle by the proximity distance between vessels and by the shortest approach time when the vessel encounter situation occurs at a recent contact point the vtso domain used by the cori model for risk assessment is the ship domain which is the minimum safe distance that the vtso senses when the vessel is in close proximity to the coastal area based on the results of a questionnaire conducted from june july 2016 lee and song 2017 calculated the risk index a i j according to the proximity distance of the cpa to the target ship considering the vtso domain safety distance at the cpa position the risk index e i j according to the vessel encountering situation of ships i and j at the cpa position and the risk index t i j according to the shortest approach time for the case where the dcpa and time to the closest point of approach tcpa are the same the velocity ratio of the two vessels at the cpa position exhibits a certain pattern with the crossing angle e i j where dcpa is 0 and the maximum risk of the two vessels encountering in a head on situation is 2 is expressed as follows 6b

index from the own ship i or j at the cpa position θ c is the relative bearing of the other ship at the cpa position a b c are the coefficients determined by the bow or stern maximum risk value of the ship and d e f are the coefficients determined by the risk level of the encounter situation the value of r c p a has a maximum value when the target ship is in the head on direction at the cpa position the value of r c p a is higher when the target ship is encountered on the starboard to starboard side than on the port to port side as shown in fig 2 a i j is at a safe level if the safety distance d s between the dcpa base line to the vtso domain crossing point and dcpa ratio is 1 or more when the other ship comes close to the safety domain according to the vtso questionnaire it is

long axis radius of 5 7l and a short axis radius of 4 35l which is shifted by 0 2l in the starboard direction and 1 2l in the bow direction from the cpa position considering the effects of elements such as ship type length beam draft and navigation time on the time remaining to collision the risk index t i j has a maximum value of 2 according to the shortest approach time from the current

traffic environment stress experienced by the navigator and cori risk ranking suggested by lee and song 2017 is presented in table 1 3 collision risk assessment 3 1 encounter situation the different encounter situations i e crossing meeting head on and overtaking are defined by bearings in degrees according to the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs in fig 4 in sector 4 and sector 2 in fig 4 the own ship os corresponds to the stand on vessel and the give way vessel respectively the overtaking vessel corresponds to the give way vessel in sector 3 in sector 1 each vessel is required to alter its course to starboard so that each passes on the port side of the other imo 1972 in this study each encounter situation was analyzed according to colregs the specifications of the vessels according to the encounter situation are shown in table 2 situation 1 occurred on february 1 2018 is a situation in which the closest distance between two vessels is approximately 15 47 min with a fishing boat and a cargo ship crossing each other at an angle of approximately 25 situation 2 occurred on march 3 2018 is a situation in which ship i is closest to the other ship at approximately 11 05 min in the target ship s head on direction and both ships are container vessels situation 3 occurred on march 4 2018 is a situation in which a chemical tanker overtakes a container ship from the stern at approximately 2 kts faster and reaches the closest distance at approximately 8 9 min before overtaking the ship tracks of each situation with 3 min vectors are shown in fig 5 3 2 risk analysis by situation in the crossing situation in fig 6 a the cori value shows a maximum value at 15 47 min after the start of the situation and the tcpa is less than zero after approximately 16 min the values of s j ω i and s j ω j are maximum at 11 13 min and 15 1 min respectively this is because the value of β i j θ changes according to the relative bearing of the other ship in the es model s j i j value when the other ship crosses from the port side of the navigator s ship or own ship the stress value s j i j is large in the case of a head on situation fig 6b the course of both ships is parallel in the direction of the bow after 11 05 min when the relative bearing of the target ship exceeds 90 the tcpa is also zero or less the es model results indicate that the maximum risk value is more than twice that of the cori model result because the es model is more influenced by the distance between the ships than the ship s course and encounter situation in the overtaking situation in fig 6c ship i is overtaking ship j at a speed approximately 2 kts faster from the stern side if ship i is the own ship the other ship is located at the stern during the initial phase of the situation so the value of s j ω i is high after ship i overtakes ship j the risk converges to zero because the other ship disappears in the stern direction from the own ship when ship j is the own ship the risk converges to zero after the target ship is located in the stern direction during the early phase of the situation and 8 9 min after the target ship passes the own ship the cori model converges the risk to zero 8 9 min after ship i overtakes ship j here the tcpa is also below zero because the collision risk disappears due to ship i which is the overtaking ship having faster speed than ship j 3 2 1 es model results the values of s j ω and the parameters for each situation applied to the es model were plotted by time in all situations the value of s j ω is maximum when the distance between the encountered vessels is at its smallest it can be seen that α has a constant result irrespective of the time change and β also changes when the relative bearing changes substantially moreover the overall shape of s j ω depends on the weighting factor ω θ the results of the es model indicate that the results of ship i and ship j differ according to the relative bearing of the target ship in both crossing and overtaking situations for the crossing situation in fig 7 a because ship j is located on the port side with respect to ship i the result of s j ω i is higher than that of s j ω j β θ is constant in the initial phase of the situation and changes 15 47 min after the simulation begins because the relative bearing of the other ship only changes substantially in the final phase of the situation in the case of the head on situation in fig 7b the results of s j ω i j are similar for both ships because the ships are located in the bow and stern direction before and after passing each other regardless of which ship is the own ship also 11 05 min after both ships meet the result of s j ω for both ships converges to zero moreover because the target ship is located on the stern side β θ also changes in the case of the overtaking situation in fig 7c the overtaking vessel is faster than the other vessel and the risk situation is terminated due to the difference of ship speed however the result of s j ω j is high after overtaking because the overtaking vessel is located in the bow direction of the other vessel once the overtaking is complete 3 2 2 cori model results the values of cori for each situation applied to the cori model and the change in each parameter with time are discussed here in all situations the cori changes over time depending on the ri change and the change in ri over time is expressed as the product of t e and a for the crossing situation in fig 8 a the time variation of the t parameter is the largest therefore the cori result also depends on the variation of the t value with the largest variation over time the a value is inversely proportional to the cpa result by time and e which represents the encounter situation according to the relative bearing at the cpa position does not show a large change before 15 47 min the variation of t with time is inversely proportional to tcpa the t value converges to zero as tcpa becomes less than zero because the risk of collision has disappeared in the case of the head on situation in fig 8b t ri and cori steadily increase until the two vessels cross each other then converge to zero once the collision risk disappears after 8 9 min the e values do not change significantly while cos is kept constant but the e value changes with course alteration of ship i at approximately 14 min the a value is inversely proportional to the dcpa as for the crossing situation the variation of t ri and cori in the overtaking situation in fig 8c also exhibits a similar rate of change furthermore approximately 4 min after the simulation begins the values of a and e increase inversely according to the dcpa change and slight course alteration of ship i 4 collision avoidance simulation 4 1 simulation condition the condition for the collision avoidance simulation is shown in algorithm 1 and table 3 the threshold value of course alteration for collision avoidance is 2 76 which is the cori ranking value exceeding 46 of the p max value in the crossing situation ship j which is the stand on vessel in the encounter relationship between the two ships maintains course throughout the scenario when the cori collision risk exceeds the threshold value ship i changes course to 10 20 and 30 and the resulting sj and cori changes according to the alteration angle are compared and analyzed the total simulation time is set to 15 47 min immediately before the scenario 1 collision 4 2 simulation results the results of the trajectory and collision risk according to course alteration from the threshold value of the simulation in the intersection situation are shown in fig 9 cori results show that the risk of collision at a course alteration of 10 and 20 is reduced to approximately 3 0 and less than 0 5 respectively moreover the collision risk result converges to zero when the own ship course is kept almost parallel to the target ship for a course alteration of 30 the s j ω i result shows that a larger angle of deviation leads to a greater distance between the two vessels and the sj value decreases in proportion to the r value the sj value of ship j does not change significantly regardless of the angle of the turn this is because the sj value which is the stress index felt by the navigator when applied to the es model is considered to be more dangerous when the relative bearing is on the port side rather than the starboard side 5 discussion the risk assessment according to encounter situation revealed that the es model value changes as the reference vessel changes for the overtaking situation although the collision risk situation disappeared after overtaking because the speed of one ship was faster the es model showed that a risk was still present because ship i was positioned in the bow direction of ship j after overtaking therefore the influence of the es model on the ship velocity is not sufficiently reflected in the risk when compared with the cori model from the results of the head on situation the cori model exhibited low risk when both ship headings were parallel even though the relative distance between the two ships was small however the risk calculated by the es model was high regardless of the encounter situation of the two ships and proportional to the distance between the ships in all encounter situations the overall risk calculated by the es model was higher than that of the cori model and the cori model was more sensitive to the effect of the encounter situation in the results of the collision avoidance simulation the cori model results and the sji results of the es model showed a similar tendency however the sjj results did not exhibit any significant differences despite the large avoidance action this is because the sj value which is the stress index felt by the navigator when applied to the es model is considered to be more dangerous when the target vessel is located at the port side rather than the starboard side the various collision risk situations i e meeting head on overtaking and multi vessel encountering cases should be further verified to evaluate the applicability of the cori model to real time systems 6 conclusions in this study we proposed a collision risk assessment model to solve the problems related to marine traffic flow evaluations based on the environmental stress es model from the navigators perspective the proposed model applied the ship domain concept based on the vessel traffic service operators vtsos perspective to improve the maritime traffic flow evaluation method utilized by the korea maritime safety audit kmsa since 2009 as the es model evaluates all vessels within 90 to the right and left of a ship to be dangerous regardless of the encounter situation between the ships we decided to consider a risk assessment model based on the ship domain concept in order to reflect the encounter situation the risk assessment method using the existing ship domain is a concept that applies the safety distance to reflect the feasibility of avoidance action prior to collision thus it can offset the disadvantages of the es model however even if the ship domains do not overlap this method will predict a collision situation when the distance to the closest point of approach dcpa becomes zero therefore we proposed a collision risk cori model that evaluates the inter vessel risk by moving the ship domain to the cpa position and conducted a risk assessment using ship vts ship tracking data for crossing head on and overtaking situations the results of the es model and the cori model were then compared and analyzed the cori model quantitatively assesses the risk associated with inter ship encounters using basic ship ais automatic identification system information in addition it has similar characteristics to the es model which quantifies the subjective collision risk felt by the navigator by quantitatively evaluating the collision risk judged by the vtso in this study we compared and analyzed the es and cori model results applied to vts ship tracking data integration of ais and radar data for crossing head on and overtaking situations in busan port in 2018 in the risk assessment results the cori model which determines the risk level according to the encounter angle at the cpa position the allowance distance with the other ship and the allowance time until collision showed the maximum risk value at the smallest tcpa thus the cori results showed that the risk situation was detected without any time delay the es model which determines the risk based on the distance to the target ship and the encounter angle showed different risk consequences depending on the reference ship in the results of the overtaking situation the es model continued to show high risk when the target ship was located in the bow direction of the ship even though the risk of collision had disappeared because the overtaking ship speed was faster therefore we conclude that the es model does not accurately reflect the parameters of ship speed to verify the real time and general applicability of the proposed cori model for collision avoidance systems we selected the crossing situation as the collision avoidance scenario where both the cori and es model results were high arbitrary risk thresholds were set and collision avoidance simulations were conducted whereby the reference values were exceeded the simulation results showed that the es model sj parameter of the reference ship decreased in proportion to the relative distance from the target ship for course alterations of 10 20 and 30 whereas no other parameters changed conversely the es model sj value of the target ship did not change substantially the cori model showed that the distance between the ships and the t and a parameters was related to the change in dcpa the e parameter related to the encounter angle at the cpa position showed a slight change with variation in the t and a parameters after a course alteration of 30 the risk of collision converged to zero after entering an approximately parallel path with the target ship according to the results of the simulation the cori model is more sensitive to the risk of different encounter situations between vessels than the es model the cori risk assessment method is therefore an improved model because it more accurately reflects the actual risk situation future studies should be conducted to prevent marine accidents caused by human error by applying navigation rules and recommending avoidance measures for waters where the traffic density is high or the sea environment is difficult in addition statistical analysis should be performed to evaluate various risk situations i e meeting head on crossing overtaking and multi vessel encountering cases that may occur in the vts area under heavy traffic conditions

22409,in korea ship collisions represent the majority of marine accidents and are substantially more likely in port areas where ship traffic is dense to improve the safe navigation of vessels the korea maritime safety audit kmsa has been conducting maritime traffic flow evaluations based on the environmental stress es model since 2009 the es model quantifies the subjective stress felt by the navigator however it does not reflect the relative bearing between ships risk assessment models using the ship domain are designed to consider the conditions of a potential encounter with a target ship and the possibility of avoidance action however even if the target ship does not invade the domain of the own ship collision may occur at the closest point of approach cpa therefore in this study the collision risk cori model which moves the existing ship domain to the cpa is applied to compare the collision risk according to the navigator s awareness of the vessel encounter conditions the results demonstrate that the cori model is a better risk assessment method than the es model because it sensitively reflects the risks due to collision avoidance action such as course alteration and speed changes keywords ship collision collision risk environmental stress es model cori collision risk model ship domain relative bearing 1 introduction in the last five years 2013 2017 ship collision contact and stranding in korea accounted for approximately 68 of all marine accidents kmst 2018 several studies have shown that human error and a lack of situational awareness are major factors in such crashes grech 2002 chauvin et al 2013 recently research into collision avoidance at sea which has included collision alert systems cas collision prevention systems and decision support systems as well as various models liu et al 2019 ni et al 2019 riveiro et al 2018 tu et al 2018 wang et al 2017 zhen et al 2017 has been recognized as a useful way to protect ships from collisions tsou et al 2010 this collision related research supports decision making by sailors enabling them to judge the risk according to the approach angle of the target ship from the own ship however there are many cases in which human error is caused by improper avoidance caused by taking too much time to judge the intention of the other ship grech 2002 maib 2004 risk assessment models using the ship domain can reflect the potential encounter conditions crossing head on overtaking situations with another ship and the possibility of collision avoidance action by applying the concept of a safety distance imo 1972 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 reviewed and categorized ship domain models into three groups empirical ship domain models fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 coldwell 1983 hansen et al 2013

et al 2010 wang 2013 rawson et al 2014 liu et al 2016 as existing ship domain models apply the ship domain at the current ship position a collision situation can occur when the distance to the closest point of approach dcpa becomes zero even if the domains of the two ships do not overlap therefore it is necessary to develop a ship domain model that can evaluate the collision situation at the closest point of approach cpa yan et al 2016 during maneuvering while maintaining the current navigational environment the vessel traffic service vts supports the information service and navigational assistance service with collision avoidance by reducing the human error of the officer on watch oow in a vessel encounter situation and ensuring that appropriate action is taken on the vessel iala 2016 imo 1997 therefore in terms of the ins information service nas navigational assistance service and tos traffic organization service which are the main functions of vts it is important to predict the ship collision risk from the perspective of the vts operator vtso and transmit the information to the relevant vessels iala 2016 it is also crucial to determine the perspective of the vtso when there is no proper or improper avoidance action thus it is necessary to develop a collision risk assessment model that improves vessel traffic safety by rapidly providing relevant information to the vessel after predicting the potential collision risk bukhari et al 2013 the korean government has implemented a korea maritime safety audit kmsa that a assesses the extent to which various port facilities in the water zone affect the safe navigation of ships and b performs maritime traffic flow evaluations for specific projects kmgl 2009 these projects involve the establishment or construction of facilities in the water zone the development of harbors ports and schemes regulated by the ministry of oceans and fisheries mof among the evaluation items of maritime traffic flow the risk items are based on the environmental stress es model inoue et al 1997 inoue 2000 yurtoren et al 2012 which is an evaluation method based on the maneuvering environment traffic environment and comprehensive environment the es model is a quantitative evaluation method based on the subjective risk level judged by the navigators which is meaningful for quantifying the stress experienced by the navigator however this method is more likely to overestimate the actual risk situation because all ships within 90 right and left of the own ship are evaluated as a stress factor therefore the risk is evaluated without considering the bearing of the encounter with the other ship in this study we introduce the collision risk cori model which is based on the vtso domain and moves the existing ship domain to the cpa position in order to compare the collision risk according to the navigator s and vtso s awareness of the vessel encounter conditions evaluation of the collision risk allows us to improve the maritime traffic flow evaluation model of kmsa which is designed from the navigators perspective the cori model evaluates the risk by considering the safe distance from domain invasion at the cpa position the allowance time for avoidance action until the collision and the potential encounter situation of the vessel at the cpa position lee and song 2017 2018 in order to evaluate the proposed cori model we apply vts ship tracking data integration of ais and radar data for crossing head on overtaking situations observed in the busan port vts control area in 2018 and compare the results with the es model results then to evaluate the potential applicability of the proposed cori model to real time collision avoidance systems around the world we perform simulations where dangerous situations are avoided through course changing if the risk exceeds a threshold based on the arbitrary cori index 2 methodology 2 1 es model the es model is divided into the environmental stresses caused by the distribution of topographical constraints around the vessel and the distribution of other ships around the own ship in this study we describe the environmental stress caused by traffic conditions which represent the quantitative risk according to the potential encounter situation between two ships inoue 2000 defined the degree of danger felt by the navigator as an environmental stress caused by traffic conditions when a vessel encounters another ship within a course range of 90 from the ship heading direction the risk perception of the ship operator was quantified as follows 1 s j i j α d i j l m β i j θ 2 0 0019 l m 3 β i j θ 0 65 ln l m γ i j θ where is the coefficient determined by the size of the navigator s ship or own ship β i j is the coefficient determined by the relative bearing of the other ship from the own ship i or j d i j is the distance between ship i and j l m is the average ship length of ship i and j γ i j θ is 2 07 if the other ship is crossing from the starboard side 2 35 if crossing from the port side 2 07 if the other ship is in a head on situation and 0 85 if the other ship is overtaking from the stern side and θ is the relative bearing of target ship from the own ship i or j the range of human vision is typically 110 to the left and right the traffic environment stress caused by an encounter with ship i at time t where the cosine function ω θ is the directional weighting function in fig 1 is defined as follows gong 2003 4 s j ω i j t s j i j ω θ 5 ω θ cos 90 110 θ 6a es t 90 90 s j ω t d θ 2 2 cori model the cori model quantifies each risk index and calculates the risk by dividing the risk by the encounter angle by the proximity distance between vessels and by the shortest approach time when the vessel encounter situation occurs at a recent contact point the vtso domain used by the cori model for risk assessment is the ship domain which is the minimum safe distance that the vtso senses when the vessel is in close proximity to the coastal area based on the results of a questionnaire conducted from june july 2016 lee and song 2017 calculated the risk index a i j according to the proximity distance of the cpa to the target ship considering the vtso domain safety distance at the cpa position the risk index e i j according to the vessel encountering situation of ships i and j at the cpa position and the risk index t i j according to the shortest approach time for the case where the dcpa and time to the closest point of approach tcpa are the same the velocity ratio of the two vessels at the cpa position exhibits a certain pattern with the crossing angle e i j where dcpa is 0 and the maximum risk of the two vessels encountering in a head on situation is 2 is expressed as follows 6b e i j r c p a i θ c r c p a j θ c 7 r c p a i j θ c a sech d θ c if 0 θ c 2 π 3 b sech e θ c π else 2 π 3 θ c 3 π 2 c sech f θ c 2 π else 3 π 2 θ c 2 π where r c p a i j θ c is the encounter risk index from the own ship i or j at the cpa position θ c is the relative bearing of the other ship at the cpa position a b c are the coefficients determined by the bow or stern maximum risk value of the ship and d e f are the coefficients determined by the risk level of the encounter situation the value of r c p a has a maximum value when the target ship is in the head on direction at the cpa position the value of r c p a is higher when the target ship is encountered on the starboard to starboard side than on the port to port side as shown in fig 2 a i j is at a safe level if the safety distance d s between the dcpa base line to the vtso domain crossing point and dcpa ratio is 1 or more when the other ship comes close to the safety domain according to the vtso questionnaire it is expressed by the following equations that set the risk to a maximum of 2 8 a i j r s d i l r s d j l 9 r s d i j l sech g l 10 l i j d c p a d s i j 1 here r s d i j l is the approaching risk index from the own ship i or j considering the safety domain g is the coefficient determined by the risk level in the vtso domain l i j is the approaching factor with the dcpa and vtso domain for ship i or j at the cpa position and d s i j is the safety distance from the cpa to vtso domain intersection for ship i or j the center of the vtso domain in fig 3 is represented by an elliptic equation with a long axis radius of 5 7l and a short axis radius of 4 35l which is shifted by 0 2l in the starboard direction and 1 2l in the bow direction from the cpa position considering the effects of elements such as ship type length beam draft and navigation time on the time remaining to collision the risk index t i j has a maximum value of 2 according to the shortest approach time from the current position to the target ship it is expressed by the following equation 11 t i j r a t i τ r a t j τ 12 r a t i j τ sech h τ if τ 0 sech k τ else τ 0 13 τ i j τ min 1 i type i j i loa i j i beam i j i

between the speed vector sum and the distance vector of the two ships and i type i j i time i j are the parameters of ship i or j affecting the time allowance such as ship type length beam draft and navigation time the cori collision risk due to encounters with another ship at time t is calculated from the risk index e i j according to the encounter situation at the cpa position the risk index a i j according to dcpa and ds considering the vtso domain safety distance and the risk index t i j according to the shortest approach time to collision the collision risk index ri expressed as the product of the risk indices e i j a i j and t i j is as follows 15 c o r i t p max 1 exp ρ 1 exp ρ r i t r i max 16 r i t e i j a i j t i j where r i t is the ship collision risk index between ship i and j at time t r i max is the maximum value of the ship collision risk index r i max 8 p max is the maximum value of the ship collision risk and ρ is the vtso s risk attitude the cori collision risk

traffic environment stress experienced by the navigator and cori risk ranking suggested by lee and song 2017 is presented in table 1 3 collision risk assessment 3 1 encounter situation the different encounter situations i e crossing meeting head on and overtaking are defined by bearings in degrees according to the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs in fig 4 in sector 4 and sector 2 in fig 4 the own ship os corresponds to the stand on vessel and the give way vessel respectively the overtaking vessel corresponds to the give way vessel in sector 3 in sector 1 each vessel is required to alter its course to starboard so that each passes on the port side of the other imo 1972 in this study each encounter situation was analyzed according to colregs the specifications of the vessels according to the encounter situation are shown in table 2 situation 1 occurred on february 1 2018 is a situation in which the closest distance between two vessels is approximately 15 47 min with a fishing boat and a cargo ship crossing each other at an angle of approximately 25 situation 2 occurred on march 3 2018 is a situation in which ship i is closest to the other ship at approximately 11 05 min in the target ship s head on direction and both ships are container vessels situation 3 occurred on march 4 2018 is a situation in which a chemical tanker overtakes a container ship from the stern at approximately 2 kts faster and reaches the closest distance at approximately 8 9 min before overtaking the ship tracks of each situation with 3 min vectors are shown in fig 5 3 2 risk analysis by situation in the crossing situation in fig 6 a the cori value shows a maximum value at 15 47 min after the start of the situation and the tcpa is less than zero after approximately 16 min the values of s j ω i and s j ω j are maximum at 11 13 min and 15 1 min respectively this is because the value of β i j θ changes according to the relative bearing of the other ship in the es model s j i j value when the other ship crosses from the port side of the navigator s ship or own ship the stress value s j i j is large in the case of a head on situation fig 6b the course of both ships is parallel in the direction of the bow after 11 05 min when the relative bearing of the target ship exceeds 90 the tcpa is also zero or less the es model results indicate that the maximum risk value is more than twice that of the cori model result because the es model is more influenced by the distance between the ships than the ship s course and encounter situation in the overtaking situation in fig 6c ship i is overtaking ship j at a speed approximately 2 kts faster from the stern side if ship i is the own ship the other ship is located at the stern during the initial phase of the situation so the value of s j ω i is high after ship i overtakes ship j the risk converges to zero because the other ship disappears in the stern direction from the own ship when ship j is the own ship the risk converges to zero after the target ship is located in the stern direction during the early phase of the situation and 8 9 min after the target ship passes the own ship the cori model converges the risk to zero 8 9 min after ship i overtakes ship j here the tcpa is also below zero because the collision risk disappears due to ship i which is the overtaking ship having faster speed than ship j 3 2 1 es model results the values of s j ω and the parameters for each situation applied to the es model were plotted by time in all situations the value of s j ω is maximum when the distance between the encountered vessels is at its smallest it can be seen that α has a constant result irrespective of the time change and β also changes when the relative bearing changes substantially moreover the overall shape of s j ω depends on the weighting factor ω θ the results of the es model indicate that the results of ship i and ship j differ according to the relative bearing of the target ship in both crossing and overtaking situations for the crossing situation in fig 7 a because ship j is located on the port side with respect to ship i the result of s j ω i is higher than that of s j ω j β θ is constant in the initial phase of the situation and changes 15 47 min after the simulation begins because the relative bearing of the other ship only changes substantially in the final phase of the situation in the case of the head on situation in fig 7b the results of s j ω i j are similar for both ships because the ships are located in the bow and stern direction before and after passing each other regardless of which ship is the own ship also 11 05 min after both ships meet the result of s j ω for both ships converges to zero moreover because the target ship is located on the stern side β θ also changes in the case of the overtaking situation in fig 7c the overtaking vessel is faster than the other vessel and the risk situation is terminated due to the difference of ship speed however the result of s j ω j is high after overtaking because the overtaking vessel is located in the bow direction of the other vessel once the overtaking is complete 3 2 2 cori model results the values of cori for each situation applied to the cori model and the change in each parameter with time are discussed here in all situations the cori changes over time depending on the ri change and the change in ri over time is expressed as the product of t e and a for the crossing situation in fig 8 a the time variation of the t parameter is the largest therefore the cori result also depends on the variation of the t value with the largest variation over time the a value is inversely proportional to the cpa result by time and e which represents the encounter situation according to the relative bearing at the cpa position does not show a large change before 15 47 min the variation of t with time is inversely proportional to tcpa the t value converges to zero as tcpa becomes less than zero because the risk of collision has disappeared in the case of the head on situation in fig 8b t ri and cori steadily increase until the two vessels cross each other then converge to zero once the collision risk disappears after 8 9 min the e values do not change significantly while cos is kept constant but the e value changes with course alteration of ship i at approximately 14 min the a value is inversely proportional to the dcpa as for the crossing situation the variation of t ri and cori in the overtaking situation in fig 8c also exhibits a similar rate of change furthermore approximately 4 min after the simulation begins the values of a and e increase inversely according to the dcpa change and slight course alteration of ship

collision avoidance is 2 76 which is the cori ranking value exceeding 46 of the p max value in the crossing situation ship j which is the stand on vessel in the encounter relationship between the two ships maintains course throughout the scenario when the cori collision risk exceeds the threshold value ship i changes course to 10 20 and 30 and the resulting sj and cori changes according to the alteration angle are compared and analyzed the total simulation time is set to 15 47 min immediately before the scenario 1 collision 4 2 simulation results the results of the trajectory and collision risk according to course alteration from the threshold value of the simulation in the intersection situation are shown in fig 9 cori results show that the risk of collision at a course alteration of 10 and 20 is reduced to approximately 3 0 and less than 0 5 respectively moreover the collision risk result converges to zero when the own ship course is kept almost parallel to the target ship for a course alteration of 30 the s j ω i result shows that a larger angle of deviation leads to a greater distance between the two vessels and the sj value decreases in proportion to the r value the sj value of ship j does not change significantly regardless of the angle of the turn this is because the sj value which is the stress index felt by the navigator when applied to the es model is considered to be more dangerous when the relative bearing is on the port side rather than the starboard side 5 discussion the risk assessment according to encounter situation revealed that the es model value changes as the reference vessel changes for the overtaking situation although the collision risk situation disappeared after overtaking because the speed of one ship was faster the es model showed that a risk was still present because ship i was positioned in the bow direction of ship j after overtaking therefore the influence of the es model on the ship velocity is not sufficiently reflected in the risk when compared with the cori model from the results of the head on situation the cori model exhibited low risk when both ship headings were parallel even though the relative distance between the two ships was small however the risk calculated by the es model was high regardless of the encounter situation of the two ships and proportional to the distance between the ships in all encounter situations the overall risk calculated by the es model was higher than that of the cori model and the cori model was more sensitive to the effect of the encounter situation in the results of the collision avoidance simulation the cori model results and the sji results of the es model showed a similar tendency however the sjj results did not exhibit any significant differences despite the large avoidance action this is because the sj value which is the stress index felt by the navigator when applied to the es model is considered to be more dangerous when the target vessel is located at the port side rather than the starboard side the various collision risk situations i e meeting head on overtaking and multi vessel encountering cases should be further verified to evaluate the applicability of the cori model to real time systems 6 conclusions in this study we proposed a collision risk assessment model to solve the problems related to marine traffic flow evaluations based on the environmental stress es model from the navigators perspective the proposed model applied the ship domain concept based on the vessel traffic service operators vtsos perspective to improve the maritime traffic flow evaluation method utilized by the korea maritime safety audit kmsa since 2009 as the es model evaluates all vessels within 90 to the right and left of a ship to be dangerous regardless of the encounter situation between the ships we decided to consider a risk assessment model based on the ship domain concept in order to reflect the encounter situation the risk assessment method using the existing ship domain is a concept that applies the safety distance to reflect the feasibility of avoidance action prior to collision thus it can offset the disadvantages of the es model however even if the ship domains do not overlap this method will predict a collision situation when the distance to the closest point of approach dcpa becomes zero therefore we proposed a collision risk cori model that evaluates the inter vessel risk by moving the ship domain to the cpa position and conducted a risk assessment using ship vts ship tracking data for crossing head on and overtaking situations the results of the es model and the cori model were then compared and analyzed the cori model quantitatively assesses the risk associated with inter ship encounters using basic ship ais automatic identification system information in addition it has similar characteristics to the es model which quantifies the subjective collision risk felt by the navigator by quantitatively evaluating the collision risk judged by the vtso in this study we compared and analyzed the es and cori model results applied to vts ship tracking data integration of ais and radar data for crossing head on and overtaking situations in busan port in 2018 in the risk assessment results the cori model which determines the risk level according to the encounter angle at the cpa position the allowance distance with the other ship and the allowance time until collision showed the maximum risk value at the smallest tcpa thus the cori results showed that the risk situation was detected without any time delay the es model which determines the risk based on the distance to the target ship and the encounter angle showed different risk consequences depending on the reference ship in the results of the overtaking situation the es model continued to show high risk when the target ship was located in the bow direction of the ship even though the risk of collision had disappeared because the overtaking ship speed was faster therefore we conclude that the es model does not accurately reflect the parameters of ship speed to verify the real time and general applicability of the proposed cori model for collision avoidance systems we selected the crossing situation as the collision avoidance scenario where both the cori and es model results were high arbitrary risk thresholds were set and collision avoidance simulations were conducted whereby the reference values were exceeded the simulation results showed that the es model sj parameter of the reference ship decreased in proportion to the relative distance from the target ship for course alterations of 10 20 and 30 whereas no other parameters changed conversely the es model sj value of the target ship did not change substantially the cori model showed that the distance between the ships and the t and a parameters was related to the change in dcpa the e parameter related to the encounter angle at the cpa position showed a slight change with variation in the t and a parameters after a course alteration of 30 the risk of collision converged to zero after entering an approximately parallel path with the target ship according to the results of the simulation the cori model is more sensitive to the risk of different encounter situations between vessels than the es model the cori risk assessment method is therefore an improved model because it more accurately reflects the actual risk situation future studies should be conducted to prevent marine accidents caused by human error by applying navigation rules and recommending avoidance measures for waters where the traffic density is high or the sea environment is difficult in addition statistical analysis should be performed to evaluate various risk situations i e meeting head on crossing overtaking and multi vessel encountering cases that may occur in the vts area under heavy traffic conditions
