8480,study region this survey was conducted in lower saxony northern germany the major german hydrocarbon province study focus the study aimed at improving our understanding of background concentrations for dissolved hydrocarbon gases in shallow groundwater more than 1700 groundwater wells were sampled determining the concentrations of dissolved methane ethane and propane new hydrological insights for the region methane was detected in all wells with 34 0 001 ml l and 14 1 ml l with 80 0 1 ml l a decreasing regional trend of methane concentrations from the north west towards south east was observed highest concentrations are encountered in marshes and lowlands although numerous exceptions are noted methane is prevalently of biogenic origin as demonstrated by its isotopic composition generally high methane concentrations are linked to high doc low sulfate and oxygen concentrations methane oxidation appears to be locally important ethane was detected in 30 of all wells propane in 12 5 the occurrence is interpreted as microbial geogenic background related to methanogenesis or organic matter degradation during diagenesis low present day ethane and propane concentrations make them the preferred monitoring parameter with respect to possible anthropogenic induced input of thermogenic gas sampling of identical wells between 2014 and 2017 demonstrate that

and wassenaar 1993 and seawater e g jones et al 2015 however only after initial studies in the us the occurrence of methane and thus the potential impact on the environment became a public concern since then numerous studies in different parts of the world have been focusing on this issue research is mainly directed on us unconventional shale gas plays like the marcellus utica e g osborn et al 2011 molofsky et al 2013 jackson et al 2013 darrah et al 2014 2015 siegel et al 2015 2016 warner et al 2012 bakken mcmahon et al 2015 barnett darrah et al 2014 nicot et al 2017c denver julesburg basin sherwood et al 2016 fayetteville warner et al 2013 haynesville nicot et al 2017a or eagle ford shale nicot et al 2017b additional studies have been conducted in canada rivard et al 2017 humez et al

context of these studies a discussion on stray gas contaminations of potable groundwater resources induced by anthropogenic activities arose e g osborn et al 2011 vengosh et al 2014 2015 vidic et al 2013 while some studies were able to correlate high methane concentrations with hydrocarbon exploitation i e fracking or leaking gas wells e g sherwood et al 2016 darrah et al 2014 reese et al 2014 others encountered similar high concentrations but attributed these to natural occurring background concentrations e g mcmahon et al 2015 molofsky et al 2016a and to migration through existing geological faults and fractures natural stray gas like in the area of the haynesville shale in east texas nicot et al 2017a only a few studies included data on repeated sampling most data revealed coefficients of variance up to 60 harkness et al 2017 sherwood et al 2016 smith et al 2016 vigneron et al 2017 humez et al 2015 rivard et al 2017 reported variations of methane concentrations over a period of 2 5 years of 2 5 6 times relative to the lowest recorded concentration of the respective well this study aims at a better understanding of the genetic history of dissolved hydrocarbon gases baseline in the largest hydrocarbon province in germany and as a possible future tool for baseline monitoring hydrocarbon gases are predominantly formed by the decomposition of organic precursors either due to thermal cracking related to increased pressure and or temperature conditions during subsidence thermogenic gas e g tissot and welte 1984 hunt 1996 or due to microbial methanogenesis biogenic gas e g milkov 2011 thauer 1998 oremland 1981 hinrichs et al 2006 fukuda et al 1984 hydrocarbon gases can genetically be differentiated based on the chemical composition and isotopic signatures of carbon and deuterium respectively thermogenic gases i e natural gas are commonly composed of methane ch4 c1 with significant amounts of the higher homologues ethane c2h6 c2 and propane c3h8 c3 where the gas dryness is defined as the ratio c1 c2 c3 this ratio and the methane carbon isotopic composition δ13c depends on the prevailing organic precursor fossil plants marine algae and the thermal history maturity methane derived from marine organic matter is more depleted in 13c 50 to 35 vs pdb than methane originating from terrestrial organic material 35 to 25 vs pdb and are usually enriched in absolute concentrations of ethane and propane relative to methane dryness ratio 100 faber and stahl 1984 barker and fritz 1981b in contrast biogenic gas is typically dominated by methane dryness ratio 1000 and extremely depleted in other components e g bernard et al 1977 schoell 1988 whiticar 1999 as well as in 13c 50 to 110 vs pdb due to the profound isotope fractionation typically associated with biogenic processes the large isotopic variation of biogenic methane depends on distinct isotope fractionation factors of different microbiological strains the initial isotopic composition of the carbon substrate and the residence time of the groundwater in the methane production zone grossman et al 1989 coleman et al 1988 the co occurrence of ethane and propane as byproducts of methanogenesis have been described as a common process in seawater hinrichs et al 2006 schobert and elstner 1980 taylor et al 2000 xie et al 2013 and lake sediments oremland 1981 oremland et al 1988 thus the presence or absence of trace amounts of ethane and or propane does not conclusively indicate whether a gas is of thermogenic or biogenic origin secondary alteration i e aerobic or anaerobic methane oxidation can significantly alter the isotopic composition by depleting methane in 12c e g colosimo et al 2016 alperin and hoehler 2010 van stempvoort et al 2005 vinson et al 2017 wolfe and wilkin 2016 thus leading to an overlap with the signature of a thermogenic methane oxidation processes of ethane or propane might selectively affect the concentration of the higher homologues although propane is biodegraded much faster than ethane ashraf et al 1994 kinnaman et al 2007 kniemeyer et al 2007 jaekel et al 2013 the occurrence of predominantly microbially sourced gas has been frequently described for example from aquifers of the denver julesburg basin sherwood et al 2016 above the eagle ford shale nicot et al 2017b or alberta humez et al 2016a microbial in situ generated hydrocarbon gases in groundwater are influenced by many complex boundary conditions methane and potentially ethane propane production by archaea is restricted to reducing conditions i e the absence of oxygen and other terminal electron acceptors like fe iii and sulfate e g lovley and chapelle 1995 devai and delaune 1996 marrin and adriany 1999 and controlled by the amount and bioavailability of organic carbon mcintosh et al 2014 wassenaar et al 1990 mcmahon et al 2011 other environmental parameters which have been identified to influence methanogenesis include temperature ph porosity and permeability availability of nutrients toxicity of trace metals and salinity schlegel et al 2011 in the subsurface and particularly in groundwater those controls may also change in various dimensions and scales controlling subsurface microbial diversity and thus occurrence of biogenic gas griebler and lueders 2009 flynn et al 2013 several studies found increased methane concentrations in older na hco3 type groundwater molofsky et al 2013 mcintosh et al 2014 bordeleau et al 2018 moritz et al 2015 humez et al 2016a whereas no correlation has been found in groundwater from the richmond river catchment new south wales australia atkins et al 2015 the occurrence of relatively high amounts of dissolved methane in some german aquifers has been known for many years e g melchers 2008 scherer et al 1998 scherer 2000 this study focusses on lower saxony ls in northern germany which covers the western part of the north german basin the major german hydrocarbon province lbeg 2017 initial results have been published by schloemer et al 2016 based on a single sampling campaign conducted in autumn 2014 due to missing data in some parts and the lack of additional information functional attribution of the individual wells to geological and hydrogeological units hydrochemical data the initial report remained descriptive rather than interpretive since then most wells have been resampled in 2016 with additional smaller subsets in 2015 and 2017 respectively based on the increased data set 1700 individual wells this study now correlates the methane concentrations with spatial geological and chemical data furthermore based on 790 individual wells sampled multiple times the temporal variations of gas concentration and methane isotopic composition over this time range is assessed 2 study area regional hydro geology germany s federal state lower saxony extends over an area of almost 48 000 km2 from the north sea coast to the central uplands of germany and can be roughly divided into two main structural geological zones the lower saxony plain lsp in the north part of the north german plain and a mountainous region in the south a line through the cities of nordhorn and hannover approximately marks the border between the two zones fig 1 the lower saxony basin a late jurassic and early cretaceous trough located in the southern part of the lsp contains numerous oil and gas fields kockel et al 1994 upper carboniferous coals generated most of the natural gas while the oil source rocks are mainly jurassic and cretaceous shales e g jurassic posidonia or cretaceous wealden shales the main reservoir formations for natural gas are deep 3000 m permian and carboniferous sandstones the few active oil fields are mainly producing from jurassic and cretaceous reservoirs in depths ranging from 1000 to 2000 m the topography of the lower saxony plain is flat with little elevation due to various glacial advances during the pleistocene era the thickness of the pleistocene sediments generally increases from south to north up to several hundreds of meters in deep glacial channels fig 2 in the north the basis of the glacial deposits are unconsolidated tertiary sediments and close to the mountainous region mesozoic bedrock the dominant geomorphological landscapes of northern germany the netherlands denmark and to a certain extent northern poland are a result of the pleistocene glaciations and processes the main three morphological units are marshland geest and lowlands the coastal region in the northwest marshes were shaped during the holocene due to eustatic isostatic driven transgressions and regressions of the north sea as a result the pleistocene sediments are overlain by marine clay with interbedded thick layers of peat fig 2 i characteristic for this part of the lsp are argillaceous tidal mud deposits sea silt these cohesive soils form aquitards which results in confined aquifers with low rates of groundwater recharge the transition zone from marshland to geest is characterized by the occurrence of fens and raised bogs geest is a local german term for elevated landscapes formed by glacial aggradation of sandy and gravely sediments during the last pleistocene glaciation epoch the geest terrains are the highest elevation of the lsp up to 170 m above sea level fig 2 iia iib the geest areas are groundwater recharge areas with mostly unconfined upper aquifers several rivers cut through geest draining along wide bottom valleys the lowlands into the north sea the river elbe weser and ems are the largest and the present day course of the rivers elbe and weser still follow the glacial meltwater valleys e g the elbe urstromtal the late glacial weichselian sediments are dominated by valley sands and gravels overlain by holocene alluvial sands and clays occurrence of low permeable fine grained sediments can locally lead to bog formation in the lowlands e g hunte leda or bourtanger fenlands interglacial organic rich sediments from holstein and eem interglacials in the sequence of glacial deposits are rather rare except for the quakenbrück basin and the lowlands of the rivers ems and vechte characteristic for the lsp are thus porous aquifers in cenozoic unconsolidated sand and gravel formations the two groundwater aquifers are the upper quaternary sediments and the lower one in tertiary sediments and deep glacial channels fig 2 the geological and hydrological situation in the southern part of lower saxony is completely different the southern mountainous region includes the harz mountains and the lower saxony hills weser leine and osnabrück hills the harz mountains are primarily made up of paleozoic rocks while mesozoic rocks are characteristic for the lower saxony hills common bedrocks are triassic sandstones buntsandstein and limestones muschelkalk upper jurassic limestones and lower cretaceous sandstones wealden formation bentheim sandstones the hydraulic situation is generally complex due to the heterogeneous geological setting resulting in variable flow velocities and groundwater levels recoverable groundwater in consolidated rocks is restricted to fractured sandstones fig 2 ix and karstified bedrocks fig 2 viii claystones of lower cretaceous e g the wealden formation and lower jurassic age e g the posidonia shale are enriched in organic carbon overlying quaternary river deposits fig 2 via b can be of local importance as groundwater reservoirs groundwater discharge springs occurs frequently 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling programs sampling of groundwater wells was performed within the framework of two different testing programs most of the samples 85 were provided by the lower saxony water management coastal defense and nature conservation agency nlwkn groundwater wells are sampled according to requirements related to regular monitoring programs the regular groundwater monitoring network consists of around 5000 wells a subset of these is sampled on a regular basis bi annually annually or longer time spans in total 1340 individual wells have been sampled for dissolved hydrocarbon gases at least once through 2014 to 2017 in addition 380 samples of groundwater wells were provided by the lower saxony state authority for mining energy and geology lbeg related to their regular groundwater sampling campaigns for 800 of the wells more than one hydrocarbon concentration analysis is available the majority of repeat well samples 700 derives from the two large test programs in autumn 2014 and spring 2016 table 1 350 wells are located in the mountainous region 787 in the geest 136 in the marshes and 429 in the lowlands respectively the majority of wells is screened in shallow aquifers 71 less than 50 m depth only 5 are deeper than 100 m only official groundwater quality control wells were probed privately owned water wells were excluded in the mountainous hill lands several samples were derived from springs 3 2 field sampling procedures sampling was done following institutional protocols based on the technical regulation din 38402 13 din 2016 dvwk 1982 in most cases submersible pumps set to low flow rates were used samples were taken after removing borehole volumes several times and stable values for the in situ parameters measured in flow through cells were reached temperature ph dissolved o2 concentration and electrical conductivity for hydrocarbon gas analysis 122 ml serum flasks were filled air free through a thin by pass tube between wellhead and flow through cell at low filling speeds to avoid disturbances and subsequent degassing all bottles were allowed to overflow several minutes samples taken by nlwkn were acidified with 2 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid before capping with aluminum crimps and teflon coated butyl rubber septa acidification was necessary to suppress any further microbial alteration since these samples had to be stored for longer time spans before shipping to the laboratory samples provided by lbeg where analytical treatment was done the day after sampling acidification was not necessary as a consequence determination of δ13cco2 was only possible in the sample set of lbeg as the acidification might result in dissolution of particulate carbonate matter all samples were kept stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until analytical work up 3 3 analytical work up and possible sources of error gas concentration was determined applying a headspace equilibration method schloemer et al 2016 after replacement of 25 ml water by laboratory grade he 5 9 the serum flasks were placed on a laboratory shaker 90 rpm for at least 2 h at 20 c prior to the following measurements the total pressure in the glass bottles was measured using a pressure transducer range 0 to 160 kpa 0 8 kpa accuracy hydrocarbon gas concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph agilent 6890 equipped with a 4 m hp1 pre column and a 50 m al2o3 column with he as carrier gas and quantified with a flame ionization detector the quantification limit is 0 2 ppm headspace concentration of all analyzed components and the relative error of the gc analysis is around 3 the concentrations of the dissolved gases were calculated from the concentrations within the equilibrated helium headspace based on headspace concentration volume 25 ml pressure and the water volume 97 ml and the henry s law constant depending on the target compound throughout the text we refer to volume concentrations of the dissolved gases nl l at a temperature of 293 k and a pressure of 101 325 pa normal pressure and temperature conditions ntp conversion factors to mass or molar units are given in the beginning of the text for normal and standard temperature and pressure conditions stp precision and accuracy of computed dissolved gas concentrations both dependent on field sampling procedures and imprecision of sample preparation measurement and applied constants previous results of our measurements have shown that relative percent difference rpd of dissolved methane concentration of split samples is 10 schloemer et al 2016 this error is related to several subjects the relative error of measurement gc can account to 3 error of 1 ml in the headspace water volumes can lead to a difference of 4 in the calculated gas concentration for the computation of dissolved gases we used median henry constants based on the compilation of data published by sander 2015 the difference between the median value used in this study and range of henry constants is less than 3 the henry constant is temperature dependent 1 c error of the temperature used for calculation might account for 2 difference in dissolved gas concentration e g colt 2012 pressure and temperature are in the range of validity of henry s and dalton s law thus the solubility of one gas component is independent of the composition of the total gas phase in equilibrium e g wilcock and battino 1974 a significant error can be induced by the sampling collection method open or closed and or the pumps used submersible or diaphragm pumps no estimation is available for the latter issue but molofsky et al 2016b published a comprehensive study on different sampling collection methods they conclude that under non effervescing conditions the different methods gave similar results however under effervescing conditions e g supersaturated methane concentrations 30 ml l a significant negative bias can occur between open and closed sampling methods thus concentrations above this threshold should always be considered as minimum concentrations to avoid censoring in interpretation of ethane and propane concentrations below quantification limit but above the detection limit were substituted with a value of one third of quantification limit e g helsel and hirsch 2002 croghan and egeghy 2003 the censoring affects 10 of the reported ethane concentrations and 5 of propane respectively thus we are in a range where the error due to censoring is low e g aruga 1997 clark 1998 carbon isotopic signatures were determined using a gas chromatograph coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer the peripherals varied in dependence on the target isotopes δ13c or δ2h and the methane headspace concentration low concentrated samples 200 ppm headspace concentration were measured after focusing methane with liquid nitrogen on a packed 1 m 1 16 porapak column methane was combusted to co2 using a gc combustion ii iii device at 960 c and analyzed on a deltaplus xl or mat 253 higher methane concentrations were measured using an agilent 6890 gc equipped with a 30 m porapak column coupled via the gc combustion ii iii interface to an mat 253 samples of the 2016 campaign with headspace concentrations 2000 ppm were analyzed for δ2hmethane using a trace gc coupled to a mat253 methane was separated isothermally at 30 c on a 30 m restek rt q bond column 0 25 mm id film thickness 8 μm and reduced to molecular hydrogen at 1420 c the concentration dependent reproducibility is 0 3 for δ13c and 3 for δ2h respectively major anions and cations were quantified in different laboratories of lbeg and nlwkn analytical procedures are following standard specifications for different methods e g ion chromatography din en iso 10304 din en iso 11885 for icp oes 3 4 data handling and management assignment of hydrological units to the different wells were done by spatially joining the wells with respective shape files using arcgis or qgis additional information screen depth etc were manually picked from borehole profiles available through the lower saxony borehole database commonly in baseline monitoring the latest available datum is used for data interpretation presentation however dissolved methane is a non conservative parameter as compared to major anions or cations due to its bioavailability and multiple ways of alteration thus we decided to use the mean of all measured concentration from the individual wells for correlation with spatial units or other geochemical data to minimize the possible impact of temporal effects analysis of the temporal variability naturally exploits results of individual samples all statistical analysis were carried out with the r statistics package r core team 2017 computed background values of different hydrological units will be available to the public via the lbeg wms server nibis http nibis lbeg de cardomap3 lang en data from individual wells might be available through the corresponding author on request 4 results and discussion 4 1 dissolved hydrocarbon concentrations and δ13c composition of methane dissolved methane was detected in all sampled wells in lower saxony although the concentrations cover a wide range of 7 orders of magnitude fig 3 table 2 from 20 nl l up to 72 ml l the majority of sampled wells roughly 80 revealed concentrations below 100 μl l the frequency distribution indicates three maxima the first at 500 nl l log10 2 6 the second at 7 μl l log10 3 8 and the third at 30 ml l log10 7 6 the latter one is obviously truncated at this concentration because it corresponds to the maximum solubility of methane with a partial pressure of 1 bar in freshwater at surface conditions duan et al 1992 wiesenburg and guinasso 1979 compared to the initial distribution based on 1000 samples schloemer et al 2016 the third maximum is more distinctive this is a result on a better statistical coverage in the nw part of lower saxony where high concentrations occur more frequently the higher homologues ethane and propane were only detected in parts of the sampled wells ethane was above the quantification limit of 10 nl l in 33 541 of the samples covering a range from 13 nl l to 21 μl l and detected but not quantified in a further 9 2 151 of the wells propane was quantifiable in less wells than those with ethane 11 177 with concentrations ranging from 9 nl l to 2 6 μl l and detected but not quantified in 2 6 44 of wells respectively the carbon isotopic composition of dissolved methane was determined for 57 960 of the individual wells it ranges over a wide span from 110 to 25 vs pdb fig 3 table 2 with a mean value at 62 the majority shows δ13c values between 80 and 55 vs pdb deuterium isotopic composition δ2h of methane varies between 80 and 360 vs smow with a normal distribution around a median value of 240 vs smow δ13c of carbon dioxide ranges from 27 5 and 5 vs pdb the mean value is 20 with 90 of all samples between 27 5 and 15 4 2 origin of dissolved hydrocarbons knowing the origin of the observed hydrocarbon gases is vital for the understanding of background concentrations and to detect possible contaminations during monitoring campaigns the individual genetic history of dissolved methane is the control for the highly variable concentrations and isotopic compositions most used indicators for the origin of hydrocarbons gas are the isotopic signatures e g schoell 1980 whiticar 1999 and its composition i e relative contents of higher hydrocarbon homologues bernard et al 1977 although δ13cmethane reveals a wide spread across the data the predominance of mean δ13cmethane values below 55 is apparent such 13c depleted methane is typical for biogenic methane schoell 1980 whiticar 1999 the isotopic signature is more variable at lower methane concentrations while the spread decreases strongly 85 to 60 for samples with high concentrations of dissolved methane 3 ml l fig 4 low methane concentrations in an aquifer are more sensitive to isotopic changes and therefore reflect the influence of secondary processes e g mixture with an additional gas source or a microbially altered methane aerobic or anaerobic oxidation the vast majority of hydrocarbons dissolved in groundwater of lower saxony is unequivocally of biogenic origin based on carbon isotopes and chemical composition in line with the generally biogenic origin of dissolved hydrocarbons in lower saxony 85 of all samples are completely devoid of propane and ethane was detected only in 44 of all samples although both components should occur concurrently if sourced from a natural gas however migrated thermal gas from larger depths might undergo some compositional fractionation among these processes are diffusion migration as a free gas phase bubbles rising due to buoyancy or dissolved in brine diffusion coefficients in water generally decrease with molar mass but the ratio of diffusion coefficients is relatively small between methane ethane 1 4 schloemer and krooss 2004 or ethane propane 1 25 witherspoon and saraf 1965 diffusional transport mass time does also depend on the solubility of the components as the solubility of propane is higher the lower effective diffusion coefficient is counterbalanced and assuming steady state diffusion from an infinite gas reservoir propane will not be completely removed similarly the migration of a free gas phase naturally along faults or associated to leaky well casings might be slightly altered due to dissolution in the water phase however available compositional data from natural gas seeps e g etiope et al 2013 saunders et al 1999 and anthropogenic induced stray gases sherwood et al 2016 do not show evidence of compositional fractionation thus eliminating all data with no propane detection from the standard bernard diagram fig 4b the remaining data are still exhibiting a biogenic signature as revealed by the high dryness ratios 1000 and δ13cmethane 55 hydrocarbon composition of a few groundwater wells might indicate a thermogenic origin for the gases most of these wells are located in areas where no wells or hydrocarbon reservoirs are present however we cannot totally exclude a non biogenic source for all samples from this study or even for all groundwater in lower saxony yet the overall pattern is more indicative for methane oxidation to have altered an original biogenic signature by causing an increase in δ13cmethane barker and fritz 1981a and lowering the dryness due to a preferred biodegradation of methane as indicated by degradation pathways depicted in fig 4b we assume a rayleigh fractionation model and apply three fractionation factors of αc 1 037 1 0136 and 1 003 spanning the reported range for anaerobic and aerobic methane oxidation e g alperin et al 1988 coleman et al 1981 seifert et al 2006 the degradation pathways are calculated starting from an exemplarily mean gas and isotopic composition of 75 000 c1 c2 c3 and 70 vs pdb respectively fig 4b these considerations demonstrate that the observed data can be well explained by oxidative processes however considering the lowest αc of 1 003 this would require a almost complete oxidation of methane 99 9 to result in a iso geochemical signature typical for a natural gas moreover it also underlines that care has to be taken if using the classical bernard plot to characterize groundwater dissolved hydrocarbons for this type of gases humez et al 2016a introduced the term pseudo thermogenic furthermore there are even indications that ethane and propane in dissolved gases in groundwater of lower saxony are a byproduct of methanogenesis and do not originate from thermogenic gas the comparison of ethane concentration and occurrence with methane concentration exhibits that ethane is frequently detected at methane concentrations below 10 ml l 70 but always at higher methane concentrations fig 5 however there can no obvious numerical correlation be computed other than a statistically significantly higher ethane concentration 270 nl l versus 90 nl l between these two methane concentration levels the occurrence of propane is to a certain extent also coupled to high methane concentrations above 1 ml l and slightly correlated with ethane concentration spearman s rho 0 38 at p 0 05 table 4 high methane concentrations are always isotopically depleted in 13c indicating a biogenic origin the comparison of δ13cco2 with δ13cmethane for a subset of samples lbeg sample set reveals that high methane concentrations are best explained with methanogenesis via the carbonate reduction pathway fig 6 a these samples are prominently derived from the marsh area with confined aquifers and frequently bearing peat layers samples depicting fermentation as dominant process are frequently derived from hydrogeological units of geest areas and boggy low lands data from a couple of wells clearly indicate an oxidation of methane similarly to the δ13c values of the co existing pair methane carbon dioxide the relation between carbon and deuterium isotopes of methane indicate carbonate reduction as the main pathway of methanogenesis associated with high concentrations fig 6b δ13c δ2h enriched samples close to atmospheric methane composition indicate a strong microbially facilitated oxidation a few samples are exceptionally depleted in both 13c and 2h a phenomenon which has also been seen in other groundwater unpublished data to which extent this is related to extraordinary high fractionation factors during methanogenesis or initially depleted precursors remains open microbially produced acetate has been described to range over a wide span δ13c 68 to 11 e g heuer et al 2009 blaser et al 2013 which could potentially result in extraordinarily 13c depleted methane following the methanogenic pathway of acetate fermentation 4 3 spatial distribution and correlation of dissolved methane with hydro chemistry the overall methane concentration is generally higher often 1 ml l in nw lower saxony and decreases to the se fig 7 the majority of the high methane concentrations are encountered in the lower saxony plain 90 of the overall wells with average concentrations of 1 μl l and even 98 with concentrations 1 ml l are located there the methane concentrations in the lower saxony plain display a general pattern for the three hydrogeological units marshes geest and lowlands exclusive of north sea islands and tidelands as presented in fig 8 the median concentration is highest in the marsh 6 ml l followed by the lowlands 18 μl l and is lowest in the geest areas 2 μl l despite the large number of outliers in the data mean levels are statistically significantly different table 3 although the difference between lowlands and geest is small the high concentrations within the marshes are associated with confined aquifers capped by organic rich holocene marine sediments composed of clastic material and peat layers fig 2 i the rapid change in methane concentration across the hydrogeological boundary between marsh and geest is often clearly visible see inset fig 7 in the lowlands high concentrations of methane are mainly found in regions featuring a widespread distribution of fens and bogs fig 2 iva and fig 1 for location of fens and bogs which is common for the low lying valleys of several tributaries of the large rivers weser and ems furthermore high methane concentrations appear to be frequently related to interglacial and interstadial deposits eem and holstein interglacial weichsel interstadial for instance methane concentrations 10 ml l are measured in the northern part of the quakenbrück basin fig 1 for which it is known that pleistocene sands are overlain by local aquitards composed of eemian deposits fig 2 ivb elbracht et al 2016 in contrast the lowlands of the rivers elbe aller and weser fig 1 show relatively low methane concentrations these rivers generally follow former weichselian meltwater valleys and a minor occurrence of bogs interglacial and interstadial deposits is interpreted compared to marshes and lowlands methane concentrations are generally lower in geest areas which are mainly composed of pleistocene glacial till and fluvial and outwash sediments with a typically low content of organic material fig 2 iia an exception is the east frisian geest located in northwest lower saxony 40 of sampled wells show 1 ml ch4 l in comparison to the other geest areas in this area widespread holocene fens and raised bogs were formed on top of a glacial till and lauenburger clay fig 2 iib elbracht et al 2016 groundwater in deeper formations typically exhibits low methane concentrations due to a lack of organic carbon fig 2 iii higher methane concentrations might occur at in local aquitards associated with increased organic carbon periglacial lake sediments or associated with miocene brown coal sands fig 2 v methane concentrations found in the mountainous region are often several orders of magnitude lower median 0 399 μl l than in the lower saxony lowland but statistically not different from the geest areas the majority of samples reveal concentrations 1 μl l methane concentrations above 0 1 ml l about 10 out of 350 samples are associated with lower cretaceous claystones fig 2 viia and sandstones viib wealden formation these include wells that are completed in quaternary sediments directly overlaying mesozoic claystones the majority of the wells filtered in quaternary aquifers in this region reveal a median concentration of less than 1 μl l although exceptions are not unusual at both the upper and lower concentration range to which extent the maximum range 50 100 μl l and minimum concentrations less than 0 5 μl l are related to different underlying bedrocks e g marly claystones or sandstones fig 2 via and vib has not been analyzed in detail concentrations in organic lean aquifers mainly joint or cavern aquifer systems are generally low 0 2 μl l e g in upper cretaceous xii and lower triassic formations viii and ix the isotopic composition of methane demonstrates a weak hydrogeologic trend with 13c becoming enriched from marshes to geest lowlands and the mountainous region fig 8 table 2 the difference is statistically significant except between marshes geest and lowlands geest table 3 however the isotopic composition varies over a wide range in each different hydrogeological unit the occurrence and median concentration of higher homologues saturated and unsaturated c2 c3 species is apparently decreasing across the subunits fig 8 one or more of these components was detected in 93 of wells completed in the marshes 54 of wells in the lowlands 42 in the geest and only in 21 of wells in the mountainous region however the differences in mean concentrations are statistically not significant table 3 a piper diagram piper 1944 is a common tool for the graphical presentation of the major anions and cations of water samples and for classification of water types it is frequently used for the direct comparison of the water chemistry of samples featuring different methane concentrations molofsky et al 2013 atkins et al 2015 harkness et al 2017 according to these studies the groundwater samples are categorized into nine groundwater types fig 9 deutsch 1997 the sampled groundwater in lower saxony is relatively young which is reflected by the high relative concentrations of calcium and magnesium hölting and coldewey 2013 the predominant water types are ca mg hco3 ca mg hco3 so4 cl and ca mg so4 high methane concentrations 1 ml l are mostly correlated to groundwater with low relative nitrate and sulfate concentrations and thus mainly associated with ca mg hco3 type groundwater and to a certain extent na cl groundwater this overall correlation is also reflected by respective spearman s rank coefficients table 4 these groundwater are mainly related to marshes or regions with raised bogs and fens or interglacial interstadial sediments the na cl dominated samples mainly originate from the marshland where sodium and chloride is enriched due to holocene marine saltwater intrusions samples with low methane concentrations 1 μl l are essentially dominated by sulfate and nitrate or bicarbonate hydrogen carbonate dominated samples derive mostly from the mountainous region and the elevated bicarbonate content is related to carbonate dissolution the sulfate and nitrate dominated samples type 7 primarily originate from geest areas and lowlands the intermediate class of methane concentration 1 μl l 1 ml l resembles the samples with low methane concentrations although the relative concentration of sulfate and nitrate is generally lower than 60 and the samples are predominantly represented by groundwater type 4 and 7 most previous studies revealed differences in mean methane concentration of different groundwater types e g in northeastern pennsylvania molofsky et al 2013 new york mcphillips et al 2014 quebec moritz et al 2015 bordeleau et al 2018 ontario mcintosh et al 2014 hamilton et al 2015 and alberta humez et al 2016a the observed difference in methane concentration and groundwater types in lower saxony are as well to some extent statistically significant the methane concentration is higher in ca mg hco3 type 1 dominated groundwater than in the groundwater of types 2 4 7 and 8 but not compared to groundwater with higher na concentrations type 3 5 and 9 on the other hand the groundwater with increased sulfate concentration types 4 7 and 8 are statistically not different however standard hydro chemical data are a poor indicator for methane occurrence in lower saxony since methanogenesis and methanotrophy are strictly redox controlled microbially mediated processes it is not surprising that a statistical evaluation reveals moderate positive correlations of methane concentration with carbon sources bicarbonate dissolved organic carbon and ammonium and negative correlation with availability of other electron acceptors sulfate nitrate dissolved oxygen table 4 under strongly reducing conditions ammonium is the dominant nitrogen species böhlke et al 2006 and derives from mineralization of organic matter thus potentially being a proxy for deeply buried organic material elevated levels of ammonium in groundwater have been described for similar hydrogeological settings mastrocicco et al 2013 glessner and roy 2009 however in shallow aquifers ammonium may also derive from use of fertilizers since no single parameter can be used as a direct proxy for methane spider plots are suggested as a visual screening method for a preliminary identification of wells likely to host elevated dissolved methane concentrations fig 10 low concentrations of oxygen nitrate and sulfate in combination with high levels of doc bicarbonate and ammonium are the principal methane indicators for groundwater in lower saxony the relationship between absolute methane and dissolved oxygen nitrate and sulfate as dominant electron acceptors is shown in fig 11 samples with high oxygen or nitrate concentrations 1 mg l exhibit generally methane concentration below 1 μl l 75 however samples featuring low oxygen and nitrate concentrations 1 mg l display differing methane concentrations the comparison of methane and sulfate reveal at reducing conditions generally high methane concentrations 75 1 ml l for groundwater with low sulfate concentrations 5 mg l this is in line with the fact that at high sulfate concentrations sulfate reducing bacteria outcompete methanogenic archaea schlegel et al 2011 the histograms reveal that methane concentrations 1 ml l are associated with strongly reducing environments oxygen nitrate 1 mg l and sulfate 5 mg l due to the absence of these anions the samples are grouped as hco3 or cl type in the piper diagram although the data set is smaller n 1549 due to missing field parameters or excluded values i e ion balance outside 10 the single distributions account for three maxima noticed within the whole sample group compare stacked histogram of figs 11 and 3 4 4 temporal variations in dissolved hydrocarbon concentrations and isotopic signature of methane in general concentrations of dissolved methane show small differences between different sampling campaigns of individual wells fig 12 the median coefficient of variation is around 35 but the scattering is large coefficient of variation cv is lower than 50 for 80 of the wells and lower than the expected error of measurement sampling 25 of replicates for 55 of the samples the observed cv s are in good agreement with other published variations ranging from 50 up to 67 humez et al 2015 sherwood et al 2016 smith et al 2016 vigneron et al 2017 the coefficient is lowest in marshes 15 followed by geest lowlands average 35 and highest in the mountainous region average 45 and is thus roughly negatively correlated to the absolute methane concentration table 4 no significant difference was found for the individual groundwater types although sampling was realized under controlled conditions some of the higher variations must certainly be attributed to field sampling procedures e g application of different pump types over the years the influence of fluid mixing due to varying positioning of the pump or changes of flow dynamics within the well on dissolved gas concentration is also a well known phenomenon gorody 2012 smith et al 2016 examining 12 domestic water wells revealed temporal variations to be related to seasonal changes in the regional water table elevation beyond that natural variations will account for observed differences as revealed by weak to moderate correlations with some redox parameters e g so4 or filter depth table 4 these variations are possibly a complex function of aquifer depth aquifer confinement and or permeability average seasonal rain meltwater and or local torrential rain percolating freshwater in the aquifer potentially changing redox conditions even fertilization with semi liquid manure not atypical for most of the rural areas can rapidly change boundary conditions for methanogenesis and or methanotrophy δ13cmethane is a potential indicator for a change in the gas source or mixing of different gases however methane is a non conservative gas and its isotopic composition is vulnerable to secondary alteration e g colosimo et al 2016 van stempvoort et al 2005 vinson et al 2017 wolfe and wilkin 2016 therefore the stability of observed isotopic composition is of prime importance and needs to be determined if used to flag possible changes due to potential stray gas intrusion into a pristine aquifer carbon isotope signatures of methane in the studied wells are stable among those samples with δ13cmethane values 60 which are generally also samples with abundances of dissolved methane in the upper range among our data set 80 of all samples are within 5 higher variations are inversely related to methane concentration spearman s rho 0 47 table 4 and become larger with decreasing δ13c spearman s rho 0 56 this is most suitably explained by microbial alteration e g wolfe and wilkin 2016 in general this confirms based on a much larger data set the observation by humez et al 2015 who reported δ13cmethane to often be a stable parameter while concentrations may vary one well sampled 10 times within 8 years 78 6 1 3 to the authors knowledge there has been no conclusive study focusing on possible variations in ethane and propane concentrations in groundwater so far within this study 789 wells have been sampled at least twice during consecutive years in 400 of them ethane concentration was consistently below detection limit considered as zero for 100 wells ethane was detected once but not in other analysis group i in fig 13 35 wells revealed 1 measurement with detection of ethane whereas other s were above quantification limit group ii the encircled samples iii relate to a well drilled into lower cretaceous shales showing consistently elevated ethane concentrations 250 μl l n 3 however in none of these samples propane was detected apparently computation of the coefficient of variation is hampered when many results are in range of the detection and or quantification limit e g one well with three or four measurements mathematically results in a coefficient of variation of 140 or 172 if one analysis is above this limit and the two or three are below zero thus we tentatively assign these larger variations to this constraint and will not further interpret them once exceeding the concentration range above twice the quantification limit the coefficient of variability is decreasing rapidly and much better than for methane for 82 of all wells with ethane concentrations 20 nl l the coefficient of variation is lower than 30 and thus being in the range of the error of measurement in 650 wells out of 789 wells with at least two measurements propane was never detected in additional 65 wells only once the remaining values reveal a similar stability of consecutive sampling periods data not shown 4 5 sensitivity of baseline values against stray gas influx beyond the initial scope of the study to provide regional background values of dissolved hydrocarbons and the genetic interpretation the acquired data additionally allow to assess the sensitivity of the base line data against a potential anthropogenic induced stray gas entry although there are several guidelines summarizing action levels and mitigation procedures once certain maximum permissible concentration levels of dissolved methane are exceeded e g eltschlager et al 2001 there are to our best knowledge no established regulatory standards for monitoring of dissolved methane in groundwater and criteria for anomaly detection limits assumedly most comparable are sniffer surveys related to off shore hydrocarbon exploration i e continuous measurements of hydrocarbons dissolved in sea water by means of towed sensors sometimes bulk signals of thermogenic hydrocarbons are used for anomaly detection lavering 1994 other surveys take advantage of component specific analysis e g logan et al 2010 two to five fold increases above the background values of individual c1 c4 hydrocarbons are considered as weak anomalies logan et al 2010 o brien et al 1992 assuming some simplifying boundary conditions e g upward migrating stray gas is not fractionated and a straightforward box model one can calculate the resulting change in hydrocarbon concentration and methane isotopic composition of the initial dissolved gases in an observation well in the absence of any guidelines regulations we test the sensitivity of the baseline data assuming two different scenarios and consider only wells which have been sampled analyzed at least twice to account for the natural variation in total 789 wells 538 with available δ13c value of methane the first scenario calculates the results based on a potential relative methane increase by 50 of the initial mean concentration the second scenario involves an absolute methane increase of 50 μl l in the groundwater which represents the 75 percentile of all methane background concentrations in our study we test the sensitivity against two different thermogenic gases a terrestrial sourced gas average δ13c 30 gas dryness 100 the most widespread source for natural gas in the study area and a marine gases δ13c 45 gas dryness 10 as criteria for positive anomaly detection we expect the resulting methane ethane and propane concentration to be larger than the initial mean concentration plus 2 standard deviations and the minimum change of methane δ13c should exceed 5 for ethane propane we apply a second conservative condition the resulting concentration should be higher than 10 times the quantification limit of 10 nl l in the first scenario relative increase in about 65 of all wells either the increased methane concentration or the change in isotopic composition would positively record an anomaly independent of the considered stray gas composition table 5 expected increases in ethane or propane concentrations are significant in 50 of all wells considering a marine sourced gas and in only 30 when considering a terrestrial sourced gas this difference is clearly related to the different gas compositions dryness ratio of both gases in general in about 25 of all wells none of the parameters would indicate a leakage it is important to point out that this is affecting wells where the initial methane and ethane propane concentration is extremely low 1 μl ch4 l with high variation large 2 sd criteria and δ13c is not available likewise the increase in c2 c3 might not exceed the conservative minimum concentration limit of 100 nl l when calculating the response due to an absolute increase of methane by 50 μl l and corresponding increase in c2 c3 concentrations scenario 2 the results are quite different the overall general sensitivity based on concentration or δ13c increases to about 80 in contrast to scenario 1 a detection based on methane data alone concentration isotopic composition is impossible when the initial concentration is high the threshold being around 750 μl l however when including ethane propane in the assessment a positive leakage detection is possible in all wells under consideration this is attributed to the significant increase in concentration of both species even considering a stray gas with a high dryness ratio this estimation shows that possible future regulations need to consider carefully which type of detection threshold is applied and how this affects the detectability of anthropogenic induced secondary enrichment in hydrocarbon gases 5 summary the high spatial variability of dissolved methane both in terms of concentration and isotopic composition is related to the complex hydrogeological situation of lower saxony in northern germany and can be linked to principal hydrogeological settings generally high methane concentrations frequently associated with traces of ethane and propane are encountered in estuarine marshes linked to high doc low sulfate and low oxygen concentrations methane concentrations in groundwater of the geest regions are variable and dominated by lower concentrations encountered in upper sandy aquifers associated with high oxygen nitrate and sulfate concentrations higher concentrations are commonly related to local peat bogs fens and meadow soils e g in the east frisian geest groundwater in deeper formations are typically low in organic carbon higher methane concentrations locally occur at in local aquitards associated with increased organic carbon periglacial lake sediments or associated with miocene brown coal sands higher methane concentrations in the lowlands occur in areas with large peat bogs fens western lowlands or when associated with interglacial sediments in the lowlands of the weser aller leine the amounts are mostly low dissolved methane concentration in the mountainous region is principally lower than in the lower saxony plain possibly due to high groundwater flow rates associated with elevated oxygen and nitrate concentrations absence of doc and increased sulfate concentrations a few sampled wells completed shortly above or in cretaceous fractured organic rich claystones can reveal higher concentrations of methane the isotopic compositions of methane vary strongly but the co occurrence of high concentrations and strong 13c depletion demonstrates a predominant origin of the methane from biogenic sources methanogenesis concentrations of oxygen nitrate sulfate hydrogen carbonate dissolved organic carbon and ammonia are in line with this interpretation and appear to principally control the occurrence of microbial methane on a magnitude scale methane oxidation occurs frequently and is indicated by partly strong 13c enrichments in methane and possibly related to the high permeability or input of oxygenated freshwater into the quaternary coarse grained sand this leads to oxidation even in deeper sands where mixing with methane rich groundwater can occur while no specific proxy to forecast methane concentrations is applicable combined interpretation of oxygen nitrate sulfate hydrogen carbonate dissolved organic carbon and ammonia might help to predict possible elevated concentrations of dissolved biogenic methane despite the large spatial variation the temporal changes in terms of dissolved gas concentration and methane isotopic signature are comparatively small highest variations are observed in shallow aquifers and or areas dominated by local groundwater flow associated with high freshwater recharge and where methane concentrations are low ethane and propane are detected unsystematically throughout the sampled wells mostly in trace amounts although contributions from thermogenic sources cannot completely be excluded a weak correlation with clearly microbially sourced methane concentrations indicates similar sources for all hydrocarbons modelling demonstrates that in contrast to methane both

8480,study region this survey was conducted in lower saxony northern germany the major german hydrocarbon province study focus the study aimed at improving our understanding of background concentrations for dissolved hydrocarbon gases in shallow groundwater more than 1700 groundwater wells were sampled determining the concentrations of dissolved methane ethane and propane new hydrological insights for the region methane was detected in all wells with 34 0 001 ml l and 14 1 ml l with 80 0 1 ml l a decreasing regional trend of methane concentrations from the north west towards south east was observed highest concentrations are encountered in marshes and lowlands although numerous exceptions are noted methane is prevalently of biogenic origin as demonstrated by its isotopic composition generally high methane concentrations are linked to high doc low sulfate and oxygen concentrations methane oxidation appears to be locally important ethane was detected in 30 of all wells propane in 12 5 the occurrence is interpreted as microbial geogenic background related to methanogenesis or organic matter degradation during diagenesis low present day ethane and propane concentrations make them the preferred monitoring parameter with respect to possible anthropogenic induced input of thermogenic gas sampling of identical wells between 2014 and 2017 demonstrate that

and wassenaar 1993 and seawater e g jones et al 2015 however only after initial studies in the us the occurrence of methane and thus the potential impact on the environment became a public concern since then numerous studies in different parts of the world have been focusing on this issue research is mainly directed on us unconventional shale gas plays like the marcellus utica e g osborn et al

context of these studies a discussion on stray gas contaminations of potable groundwater resources induced by anthropogenic activities arose e g osborn et al 2011 vengosh et al 2014 2015 vidic et al 2013 while some studies were able to correlate high methane concentrations with hydrocarbon exploitation i e fracking or leaking gas wells e g sherwood et al 2016 darrah et al 2014 reese et al 2014 others encountered similar high concentrations but attributed these to natural occurring background concentrations e g mcmahon et al 2015 molofsky et al 2016a and to migration through existing geological faults and fractures natural stray gas like in the area of the haynesville shale in east texas nicot et al 2017a only a few studies included data on repeated sampling most data revealed coefficients of variance up to 60 harkness et al 2017 sherwood et al 2016 smith et al 2016 vigneron et al 2017 humez et al 2015 rivard et al 2017 reported variations of methane concentrations over a period of 2 5 years of 2 5 6 times relative to the lowest recorded concentration of the respective well this study aims at a better understanding of the genetic history of dissolved hydrocarbon gases baseline in the largest hydrocarbon province in germany and as a possible future tool for baseline monitoring hydrocarbon gases are predominantly formed by the decomposition of organic precursors either due to thermal cracking related to increased pressure and or temperature conditions during subsidence thermogenic gas e g tissot and welte 1984 hunt 1996 or due to microbial methanogenesis biogenic gas e g milkov 2011 thauer 1998 oremland 1981 hinrichs et al 2006 fukuda et al 1984 hydrocarbon gases can genetically be differentiated based on the chemical composition and isotopic signatures of carbon and deuterium respectively thermogenic gases i e natural gas are commonly composed of methane ch4 c1 with significant amounts of the higher homologues ethane c2h6 c2 and propane c3h8 c3 where the gas dryness is defined as the ratio c1 c2 c3 this ratio and the methane carbon isotopic composition δ13c depends on the prevailing organic precursor fossil plants marine algae and the thermal history maturity methane derived from marine organic matter is more depleted in 13c 50 to 35 vs pdb than methane originating from terrestrial organic material 35 to 25 vs pdb and are usually enriched in absolute concentrations of ethane and propane relative to methane dryness ratio 100 faber and stahl 1984 barker and fritz 1981b in contrast biogenic gas is typically dominated by methane dryness ratio 1000 and extremely depleted in other components e g bernard et al 1977 schoell 1988 whiticar 1999 as well as in 13c 50 to 110 vs pdb due to the profound isotope fractionation typically associated with biogenic processes the large isotopic variation of biogenic methane depends on distinct isotope fractionation factors of different microbiological strains the initial isotopic composition of the carbon substrate and the residence time of the groundwater in the methane production zone grossman et al 1989 coleman et al 1988 the co occurrence of ethane and propane as byproducts of methanogenesis have been described as a common process in seawater hinrichs et al 2006 schobert and elstner 1980 taylor et al 2000 xie et al 2013 and lake sediments oremland 1981 oremland et al 1988 thus the presence or absence of trace amounts of ethane and or propane does not conclusively indicate whether a gas is of thermogenic or biogenic origin secondary alteration i e aerobic or anaerobic methane oxidation can significantly alter the isotopic composition by depleting methane in 12c e g colosimo et al 2016 alperin and hoehler 2010 van stempvoort et al 2005 vinson et al 2017 wolfe and wilkin 2016 thus leading to an overlap with the signature of a thermogenic methane oxidation processes of ethane or propane might selectively affect the concentration of the higher homologues although propane is biodegraded much faster than ethane ashraf et al 1994 kinnaman et al 2007 kniemeyer et al 2007 jaekel et al 2013 the occurrence of predominantly microbially sourced gas has been frequently described for example from aquifers of the denver julesburg basin sherwood et al 2016 above the eagle ford shale nicot et al 2017b or alberta humez et al 2016a microbial in situ generated hydrocarbon gases in groundwater are influenced by many complex boundary conditions methane and potentially ethane propane production by archaea is restricted to reducing conditions i e the

from the richmond river catchment new south wales australia atkins et al 2015 the occurrence of relatively high amounts of dissolved methane in some german aquifers has been known for many years e g melchers 2008 scherer et al 1998 scherer 2000 this study focusses on lower saxony ls in northern germany which covers the western part of the north german basin the major german hydrocarbon province lbeg 2017 initial results have been published by schloemer et al 2016 based on a single sampling campaign conducted in autumn 2014 due to missing data in some parts and the lack of additional information functional attribution of the individual wells to geological and hydrogeological units hydrochemical data the initial report remained descriptive rather than interpretive since then most wells have been resampled in 2016 with additional smaller subsets in 2015 and 2017 respectively based on the increased data set 1700 individual wells this study now correlates the methane concentrations with spatial geological and chemical data furthermore based on 790 individual wells sampled multiple times the temporal variations of gas concentration and methane isotopic composition over this time range is assessed 2 study area regional hydro geology germany s federal state lower saxony extends over an area of almost 48 000 km2 from the north sea coast to the central uplands of germany and can be roughly divided into two main structural geological zones the lower saxony plain lsp in the north part of the north german plain and a mountainous region in the south a line through the cities of nordhorn and hannover approximately marks the border between the two zones fig 1 the lower saxony basin a late jurassic and early cretaceous trough located in the southern part of the lsp contains numerous oil and gas fields kockel et al 1994 upper carboniferous coals generated most of the natural gas while the oil source rocks are mainly jurassic and cretaceous shales e g jurassic posidonia or cretaceous wealden shales the main reservoir formations for natural gas are deep 3000 m permian and carboniferous sandstones the few active oil fields are mainly producing from jurassic and cretaceous reservoirs in depths ranging from 1000 to 2000 m the topography of the lower saxony plain is flat with little elevation due to various glacial advances during the pleistocene era the thickness of the pleistocene sediments generally increases from south to north up to several hundreds of meters in deep glacial channels fig 2 in the north the basis of the glacial deposits are unconsolidated tertiary sediments and close to the mountainous region mesozoic bedrock the dominant geomorphological landscapes of northern germany the netherlands denmark and to a certain extent northern poland are a result of the pleistocene glaciations and processes the main three morphological units are marshland geest and lowlands the coastal region in the northwest marshes were shaped during the holocene due to eustatic isostatic driven transgressions and regressions of the north sea as a result the pleistocene sediments are overlain by marine clay with interbedded thick layers of peat fig 2 i characteristic for this part of the lsp are argillaceous tidal mud deposits sea silt these cohesive soils form aquitards which results in confined aquifers with low rates of groundwater recharge the transition zone from marshland to geest is characterized by the occurrence of fens and raised bogs geest is a local german term for elevated landscapes formed by glacial aggradation of sandy and gravely sediments during the last pleistocene glaciation epoch the geest terrains are the highest elevation of the lsp up to 170 m above sea level fig 2 iia iib the geest areas are groundwater recharge areas with mostly unconfined upper aquifers several rivers cut through geest draining along wide bottom valleys the lowlands into the north sea the river elbe weser and ems are the largest and the present day course of the rivers elbe and weser still follow the glacial meltwater valleys e g the elbe urstromtal the late glacial weichselian sediments are dominated by valley sands and gravels overlain by holocene alluvial sands and clays occurrence of low permeable fine grained sediments can locally lead to bog formation in the lowlands e g hunte leda or bourtanger fenlands interglacial organic rich sediments from holstein and eem interglacials in the sequence of glacial deposits are rather rare except for the quakenbrück basin and the lowlands of the rivers ems and vechte characteristic for the lsp are thus porous aquifers in cenozoic unconsolidated sand and gravel formations the two groundwater aquifers are the upper quaternary sediments and the lower one in tertiary sediments and deep glacial channels fig 2 the geological and hydrological situation in the southern part of lower saxony is completely different the southern mountainous region includes the harz mountains and the lower saxony hills weser leine and osnabrück hills the harz mountains are primarily made up of paleozoic rocks while mesozoic rocks are characteristic for the lower saxony hills common bedrocks are triassic sandstones buntsandstein and limestones muschelkalk upper jurassic limestones and lower cretaceous sandstones wealden formation bentheim sandstones the hydraulic situation is generally complex due to the heterogeneous geological setting resulting in variable flow velocities and groundwater levels recoverable groundwater in consolidated rocks is restricted to fractured sandstones fig 2 ix and karstified bedrocks fig 2 viii claystones of lower cretaceous e g the wealden formation and lower jurassic age e g the posidonia shale are enriched in organic carbon

subset of these is sampled on a regular basis bi annually annually or longer time spans in total 1340 individual wells have been sampled for dissolved hydrocarbon gases at least once through 2014 to 2017 in addition 380 samples of groundwater wells were provided by the lower saxony state authority for mining energy and geology lbeg related to their regular groundwater sampling campaigns for 800 of the wells more than one hydrocarbon concentration analysis is available the majority of repeat well samples 700 derives from the two large test programs in autumn 2014 and spring 2016 table 1 350 wells are located in the mountainous region 787 in the geest 136 in the marshes and 429 in the lowlands respectively the majority of wells is screened in shallow aquifers 71 less than 50 m depth only 5 are deeper than 100 m only official groundwater quality control wells were probed privately owned water wells were excluded in the mountainous hill lands several samples were derived from springs 3 2 field sampling procedures sampling was done following institutional protocols based on the technical regulation din 38402 13 din 2016 dvwk 1982 in most cases submersible pumps set to low flow rates were used samples were taken after removing borehole volumes several times and stable values for the in situ parameters measured in flow through cells were reached temperature ph dissolved o2 concentration and electrical conductivity for hydrocarbon gas analysis 122 ml serum flasks were filled air free through a thin by pass tube between wellhead and flow through cell at low filling speeds to avoid disturbances and subsequent degassing all bottles were allowed to overflow several minutes samples taken by nlwkn were acidified with 2 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid before capping with aluminum crimps and teflon coated butyl rubber septa acidification was necessary to suppress any further microbial alteration since these samples had to be stored for longer time spans before shipping to the laboratory samples provided by lbeg where analytical treatment was done the day after sampling acidification was not necessary as a consequence determination of δ13cco2 was only possible in the sample set of lbeg as the acidification might result in dissolution of particulate carbonate matter all samples were kept stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until analytical work up 3 3 analytical work up and possible sources of error gas concentration was determined applying a headspace equilibration method schloemer et al 2016 after replacement of 25 ml water by laboratory grade he 5 9 the serum flasks were placed on a laboratory shaker 90 rpm for at least 2 h at 20 c prior to the following measurements the total pressure in the glass bottles was measured using a pressure transducer range 0 to 160 kpa 0 8 kpa accuracy hydrocarbon gas concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph agilent 6890 equipped with a 4 m hp1 pre column and a 50 m al2o3 column with he as carrier gas and quantified with a flame ionization detector the quantification limit is 0 2 ppm headspace concentration of all analyzed components and the relative error of the gc analysis is around 3 the concentrations of the dissolved gases were calculated from the concentrations within the equilibrated helium headspace based on headspace concentration volume 25 ml pressure and the water volume 97 ml and the henry s law constant depending on the target compound throughout the text we refer to volume concentrations of the dissolved gases nl l at a temperature of 293 k and a pressure of 101 325 pa normal pressure and temperature conditions ntp conversion factors to mass or molar units are given in the beginning of the text for normal and standard temperature and pressure conditions stp precision and accuracy of computed dissolved gas concentrations both dependent on field sampling procedures and imprecision of sample preparation measurement and applied constants previous results of our measurements have shown that relative percent difference rpd of dissolved methane concentration of split samples is 10 schloemer et al 2016 this error is related to several subjects the relative error of measurement gc can account to 3 error of 1 ml in the headspace water volumes can lead to a difference of 4 in the calculated gas concentration for the computation of dissolved gases we used median henry constants based on the compilation of data published by sander 2015 the difference between the median value used in this study and range of henry constants is less than 3 the henry constant is temperature dependent 1 c error of the temperature used for calculation might account for 2 difference in dissolved gas concentration e g colt 2012 pressure and temperature are in the range of validity of henry s and dalton s law thus the solubility of one gas component is independent of the composition of the total gas phase in equilibrium e g wilcock and battino 1974 a significant error can be induced by the sampling collection method open or closed and or the pumps used submersible or diaphragm pumps no estimation is available for the latter issue but molofsky et al 2016b published a comprehensive study on different sampling collection methods they conclude that under non effervescing conditions the different methods gave similar results however under effervescing conditions e g supersaturated methane concentrations 30 ml l a significant negative bias can occur between open and closed sampling methods thus concentrations above this threshold should always be considered as minimum concentrations to avoid censoring in interpretation of ethane and propane concentrations below quantification limit but above the detection limit were substituted with a value of one third of quantification limit e g helsel and hirsch 2002 croghan and egeghy 2003 the censoring affects 10 of the reported ethane concentrations and 5 of propane respectively thus we are in a range where the error due to censoring is low e g aruga 1997 clark 1998 carbon isotopic signatures were determined using a gas chromatograph coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer the peripherals varied in dependence on the target isotopes δ13c or δ2h and the methane headspace concentration low concentrated samples 200 ppm headspace concentration were measured after focusing methane with liquid nitrogen on a packed 1 m 1 16 porapak column methane was combusted to co2 using a gc combustion ii iii device at 960 c and analyzed on a deltaplus xl or mat 253 higher methane concentrations were measured using an agilent 6890 gc equipped with a 30 m porapak column coupled via the gc combustion ii iii interface to an mat 253 samples of the 2016 campaign with headspace concentrations 2000 ppm were analyzed for δ2hmethane using a trace gc coupled to a mat253 methane was separated isothermally at 30 c on a 30 m restek rt q bond column 0 25 mm id film thickness 8 μm and reduced to molecular hydrogen at 1420 c the concentration dependent reproducibility is 0 3 for δ13c and 3 for δ2h respectively major anions and cations were quantified in different laboratories of lbeg and nlwkn analytical procedures are following standard specifications for different methods e g ion chromatography din en iso 10304 din en iso 11885 for icp oes 3 4 data handling and management assignment of hydrological units to the different wells were done by spatially joining the wells with respective shape files using arcgis or qgis additional information screen depth etc were manually picked from borehole profiles available through the lower saxony borehole database commonly in baseline monitoring the latest available datum is used for data interpretation presentation however dissolved methane is a non conservative parameter as compared to major anions or cations due to its bioavailability and multiple ways of alteration thus we decided to use the mean of all measured concentration from the individual wells for correlation with spatial units or other geochemical data to minimize the possible impact of temporal effects analysis of the temporal variability naturally exploits results of individual samples all statistical analysis were carried out with the r statistics package r core team 2017 computed background values of different hydrological units will be available to the public via the lbeg wms server nibis http nibis lbeg de cardomap3 lang en data from individual wells might be available through the corresponding author on request 4 results and discussion 4 1 dissolved hydrocarbon concentrations and δ13c composition of methane dissolved methane was detected in all sampled wells in lower saxony although the concentrations cover a wide range of 7 orders of magnitude fig 3 table 2 from 20 nl l up to 72 ml l the majority of sampled wells roughly 80 revealed concentrations below 100 μl l the frequency distribution indicates three maxima the first at 500 nl l log10 2 6 the second at 7 μl l log10 3 8 and the third at 30 ml l log10 7 6 the latter one is obviously truncated at this concentration because it corresponds to the maximum solubility of methane with a partial pressure of 1 bar in freshwater at surface conditions duan et al 1992 wiesenburg and guinasso 1979 compared to the initial distribution based on 1000 samples schloemer et al 2016 the third maximum is more distinctive this is a result on a better statistical coverage in the nw part of lower saxony where high concentrations occur more frequently the higher homologues ethane and propane were only detected in parts of the sampled wells ethane was above the quantification limit of 10 nl l in 33 541 of the samples covering a range from 13 nl l to 21 μl l and detected but not quantified in a further 9 2 151 of the wells propane was quantifiable in less wells than those with ethane 11 177 with concentrations ranging from 9 nl l to 2 6 μl l and detected but not quantified in 2 6 44 of wells respectively the carbon isotopic composition of dissolved methane was determined for 57 960 of the individual wells it ranges over a wide span from 110 to 25 vs pdb fig 3 table 2 with a mean value at 62 the majority shows δ13c values between 80 and 55 vs pdb deuterium isotopic composition δ2h of methane varies between 80 and 360 vs smow with a normal distribution around a median value of 240 vs smow δ13c of carbon dioxide ranges from 27 5 and 5 vs pdb the mean value is 20 with 90 of all samples between 27 5 and 15 4 2 origin of dissolved hydrocarbons knowing the origin of the observed hydrocarbon gases is vital for the understanding of background concentrations and to detect possible contaminations during monitoring campaigns the individual genetic history of dissolved methane is the control for the highly variable concentrations and isotopic compositions most used indicators for the origin of hydrocarbons gas are the isotopic signatures e g schoell 1980 whiticar 1999 and its composition i e relative contents of higher hydrocarbon homologues bernard et al 1977 although δ13cmethane reveals a wide spread across the data the predominance of mean δ13cmethane values below 55 is apparent such 13c depleted methane is typical for biogenic methane schoell 1980 whiticar 1999 the isotopic signature is more variable at lower methane concentrations while the spread decreases strongly 85 to 60 for samples with high concentrations of dissolved methane 3 ml l fig 4 low methane concentrations in an aquifer are more sensitive to isotopic changes and therefore reflect the influence of secondary processes e g mixture with an additional gas source or a microbially altered methane aerobic or anaerobic oxidation the vast majority of hydrocarbons dissolved in groundwater of lower saxony is unequivocally of biogenic origin based on carbon isotopes and chemical composition in line with the generally biogenic origin of dissolved hydrocarbons in lower saxony 85 of all samples are completely devoid of propane and ethane was detected only in 44 of all samples although both components should occur concurrently if sourced from a natural gas however migrated thermal gas from larger depths might undergo some compositional fractionation among these processes are diffusion migration as a free gas phase bubbles rising due to buoyancy or dissolved in brine diffusion coefficients in water generally decrease with molar mass but the ratio of diffusion coefficients is relatively small between methane ethane 1 4 schloemer and krooss 2004 or ethane propane 1 25 witherspoon and saraf 1965 diffusional transport mass time does also depend on the solubility of the components as the solubility of propane is higher the lower effective diffusion coefficient is counterbalanced and assuming steady state diffusion from an infinite gas reservoir propane will not be completely removed similarly the migration of a free gas phase naturally along faults or associated to leaky well casings might be slightly altered due to dissolution in the water phase however available compositional data from natural gas seeps e g etiope et al 2013 saunders et al 1999 and anthropogenic induced stray gases sherwood et al 2016 do not show evidence of compositional fractionation thus eliminating all data with no propane detection from the standard bernard diagram fig 4b the remaining data are still exhibiting a biogenic signature as revealed by the high dryness ratios 1000 and δ13cmethane 55 hydrocarbon composition of a few groundwater wells might indicate a thermogenic origin for the gases most of these wells are located in areas where no wells or hydrocarbon reservoirs are present however we cannot totally exclude a non biogenic source for all samples from this study or even for all groundwater in lower saxony yet the overall pattern is more indicative for methane oxidation to have altered an original biogenic signature by causing an increase in δ13cmethane barker and fritz 1981a and lowering the dryness due to a preferred biodegradation of methane as indicated by degradation pathways depicted in fig 4b we assume a rayleigh fractionation model and apply three fractionation factors of αc 1 037 1 0136 and 1 003 spanning the reported range for anaerobic and aerobic methane oxidation e g alperin et al 1988 coleman et al 1981 seifert et al 2006 the degradation pathways are calculated starting from an exemplarily mean gas and isotopic composition of 75 000 c1 c2 c3 and 70 vs pdb respectively fig 4b these considerations demonstrate that the observed data can be well explained by oxidative processes however considering the lowest αc of 1 003 this would require a almost complete oxidation of methane 99 9 to result in a iso geochemical signature typical for a natural gas moreover it also underlines that care has to be taken if using the classical bernard plot to characterize groundwater dissolved hydrocarbons for this type of gases humez et al 2016a introduced the term pseudo thermogenic furthermore there are even indications that ethane and propane in dissolved gases in groundwater of lower saxony are a byproduct of methanogenesis and do not originate from thermogenic gas the comparison of ethane concentration and occurrence with methane concentration exhibits that ethane is frequently detected at methane concentrations below 10 ml l 70 but always at higher methane concentrations fig 5 however there can no obvious numerical correlation be computed other than a statistically significantly higher ethane concentration 270 nl l versus 90 nl l between these two methane concentration levels the occurrence of propane is to a certain extent also coupled to high methane concentrations above 1 ml l and slightly correlated with ethane concentration spearman s rho 0 38 at p 0 05 table 4 high methane concentrations are always isotopically depleted in 13c indicating a biogenic origin the comparison of δ13cco2 with δ13cmethane for a subset of samples lbeg sample set reveals that high methane concentrations are best explained with methanogenesis via the carbonate reduction pathway fig 6 a these samples are prominently derived from the marsh area with confined aquifers and frequently bearing peat layers samples depicting fermentation as dominant process are frequently derived from hydrogeological units of geest areas and boggy low lands data from a couple of wells clearly indicate an oxidation of methane similarly to the δ13c values of the co existing pair methane carbon dioxide the relation between carbon and deuterium isotopes of methane indicate carbonate reduction as the main pathway of methanogenesis associated with high concentrations fig 6b δ13c δ2h enriched samples close to atmospheric methane composition indicate a strong microbially facilitated oxidation a few samples are exceptionally depleted in both 13c and 2h a phenomenon which has also been seen in other groundwater unpublished data to which extent this is related to extraordinary high fractionation factors during methanogenesis or initially depleted precursors remains open microbially produced acetate has been described to range over a wide span δ13c 68 to 11 e g heuer et al 2009 blaser et al 2013 which could potentially result in extraordinarily 13c depleted methane following the methanogenic pathway of acetate fermentation 4 3 spatial distribution and correlation of dissolved methane with hydro chemistry the overall methane concentration is generally higher often 1 ml l in nw lower saxony and decreases to the se fig 7 the majority of the high methane concentrations are encountered in the lower saxony plain 90 of the overall wells with average concentrations of 1 μl l and even 98 with concentrations 1 ml l are located there the methane concentrations in the lower saxony plain display a general pattern for the three hydrogeological units marshes geest and lowlands exclusive of north sea islands and tidelands as presented in fig 8 the median concentration is highest in the marsh 6 ml l followed by the lowlands 18 μl l and is lowest in the geest areas 2 μl l despite the large number of outliers in the data mean levels are statistically significantly different table 3 although the difference between lowlands and geest is small the high concentrations within the marshes are associated with confined aquifers capped by organic rich holocene marine sediments composed of clastic material and peat layers fig 2 i the rapid change in methane concentration across the hydrogeological boundary between marsh and geest is often clearly visible see inset fig 7 in the lowlands high concentrations of methane are mainly found in regions featuring a widespread distribution of fens and bogs fig 2 iva and fig 1 for location of fens and bogs which is common for the low lying valleys of several tributaries of the large rivers weser and ems furthermore high methane concentrations appear to be frequently related to interglacial and interstadial deposits eem and holstein interglacial weichsel interstadial for instance methane concentrations 10 ml l are measured in the northern part of the quakenbrück basin fig 1 for which it is known that pleistocene sands are overlain by local aquitards composed of eemian deposits fig 2 ivb elbracht et al 2016 in contrast the lowlands of the rivers elbe aller and weser fig 1 show relatively low methane concentrations these rivers generally follow former weichselian meltwater valleys and a minor occurrence of bogs interglacial and interstadial deposits is interpreted compared to marshes and lowlands methane concentrations are generally lower in geest areas which are mainly composed of pleistocene glacial till and fluvial and outwash sediments with a typically low content of organic material fig 2 iia an exception is the east frisian geest located in northwest lower saxony 40 of sampled wells show 1 ml ch4 l in comparison to the other geest areas in this area widespread holocene fens and raised bogs were formed on top of a glacial till and lauenburger clay fig 2 iib elbracht et al 2016 groundwater in deeper formations typically exhibits low methane concentrations due to a lack of organic carbon fig 2 iii higher methane concentrations might occur at in local aquitards associated with increased organic carbon periglacial lake sediments or associated with miocene brown coal sands fig 2 v methane concentrations found in the mountainous region are often several orders of magnitude lower median 0 399 μl l than in the lower saxony lowland but statistically not different from the geest areas the majority of samples reveal concentrations 1 μl l methane concentrations above 0 1 ml l about 10 out of 350 samples are associated with lower cretaceous claystones fig 2 viia and sandstones viib wealden formation these include wells that are completed in quaternary sediments directly overlaying mesozoic claystones the majority of the wells filtered in quaternary aquifers in this region reveal a median concentration of less than 1 μl l although exceptions are not unusual at both the upper and lower concentration range to which extent the maximum range 50 100 μl l and minimum concentrations less than 0 5 μl l are related to different underlying bedrocks e g marly claystones or sandstones fig 2 via and vib has not been analyzed in detail concentrations in organic lean aquifers mainly joint or cavern aquifer systems are generally low 0 2 μl l e g in upper cretaceous xii and lower triassic formations viii and ix the isotopic composition of methane demonstrates a weak hydrogeologic trend with 13c becoming enriched from marshes to geest lowlands and the mountainous region fig 8 table 2 the difference is statistically significant except between marshes geest and lowlands geest table 3 however the isotopic composition varies over a wide range in each different hydrogeological unit the occurrence and median concentration of higher homologues saturated and unsaturated c2 c3 species is apparently decreasing across the subunits fig 8 one or more of these components was detected in 93 of wells completed in the marshes 54 of wells in the lowlands 42 in the geest and only in 21 of wells in the mountainous region however the differences in mean concentrations are statistically not significant table 3 a piper diagram piper 1944 is a common tool for the graphical presentation of the major anions and cations of water samples and for classification of water types it is frequently used for the direct comparison of the water chemistry of samples featuring different methane concentrations molofsky et al 2013 atkins et al 2015 harkness et al 2017 according to these studies the groundwater samples are categorized into nine groundwater types fig 9 deutsch 1997 the sampled groundwater in lower saxony is relatively young which is reflected by the high relative concentrations of calcium and magnesium hölting and coldewey 2013 the predominant water types are ca mg hco3 ca mg hco3 so4 cl and ca mg so4 high methane concentrations 1 ml l are mostly correlated to groundwater with low relative nitrate and sulfate concentrations and thus mainly associated with ca mg hco3 type groundwater and to a certain extent na cl groundwater this overall correlation is also reflected by respective spearman s rank coefficients table 4 these groundwater are mainly related to marshes or regions with raised bogs and fens or interglacial interstadial sediments the na cl dominated samples mainly originate from the marshland where sodium and chloride is enriched due to holocene marine saltwater intrusions samples with low methane concentrations 1 μl l are essentially dominated by sulfate and nitrate or bicarbonate hydrogen carbonate dominated samples derive mostly from the mountainous region and the elevated bicarbonate content is related to carbonate dissolution the sulfate and nitrate dominated samples type 7 primarily originate from geest areas and lowlands the intermediate class of methane concentration 1 μl l 1 ml l resembles the samples with low methane concentrations although the relative concentration of sulfate and nitrate is generally lower than 60 and the samples are predominantly represented by groundwater type 4 and 7 most previous studies revealed differences in mean methane concentration of different groundwater types e g in northeastern pennsylvania molofsky et al 2013 new york mcphillips et al 2014 quebec moritz et al 2015 bordeleau et al 2018 ontario mcintosh et al 2014 hamilton et al 2015 and alberta humez et al 2016a the observed difference in methane concentration and groundwater types in lower saxony are as well to some extent statistically significant the methane concentration is higher in ca mg hco3 type 1 dominated groundwater than in the groundwater of types 2 4 7 and 8 but not compared to groundwater with higher na concentrations type 3 5 and 9 on the other hand the groundwater with increased sulfate concentration types 4 7 and 8 are statistically not different however standard hydro chemical data are a poor indicator for methane occurrence in lower saxony since methanogenesis and methanotrophy are strictly redox controlled microbially mediated processes it is not surprising that a statistical evaluation reveals moderate positive correlations of methane concentration with carbon sources bicarbonate dissolved organic carbon and ammonium and negative correlation with availability of other electron acceptors sulfate nitrate dissolved oxygen table 4 under strongly reducing conditions ammonium is the dominant nitrogen species böhlke et al 2006 and derives from mineralization of organic matter thus potentially being a proxy for deeply buried organic material elevated levels of ammonium in groundwater have been described for similar hydrogeological settings mastrocicco et al 2013 glessner and roy 2009 however in shallow aquifers ammonium may also derive from use of fertilizers since no single parameter can be used as a direct proxy for methane spider plots are suggested as a visual screening method for a preliminary identification of wells likely to host elevated dissolved methane concentrations fig 10 low concentrations of oxygen nitrate and sulfate in combination with high levels of doc bicarbonate and ammonium are the principal methane indicators for groundwater in lower saxony the relationship between absolute methane and dissolved oxygen nitrate and sulfate as dominant electron acceptors is shown in fig 11 samples with high oxygen or nitrate concentrations 1 mg l exhibit generally methane concentration below 1 μl l 75 however samples featuring low oxygen and nitrate concentrations 1 mg l display differing methane concentrations the comparison of methane and sulfate reveal at reducing conditions generally high methane concentrations 75 1 ml l for groundwater with low sulfate concentrations 5 mg l this is in line with the fact that at high sulfate concentrations sulfate reducing bacteria outcompete methanogenic archaea schlegel et al 2011 the histograms reveal that methane concentrations 1 ml l are associated with strongly reducing environments oxygen nitrate 1 mg l and sulfate 5 mg l due to the absence of these anions the samples are grouped as hco3 or cl type in the piper diagram although the data set is smaller n 1549 due to missing field parameters or excluded values i e ion balance outside 10 the single distributions account for three maxima noticed within the whole sample group compare stacked histogram of figs 11 and 3 4 4 temporal variations in dissolved hydrocarbon concentrations and isotopic signature of methane in general concentrations of dissolved methane show small differences between different sampling campaigns of individual wells fig 12 the median coefficient of variation is around 35 but the scattering is large coefficient of variation cv is lower than 50 for 80 of the wells and lower than the expected error of measurement sampling 25 of replicates for 55 of the samples the observed cv s are in good agreement with other published variations ranging from 50 up to 67 humez et al 2015 sherwood et al 2016 smith et al 2016 vigneron et al 2017 the coefficient is lowest in marshes 15 followed by geest lowlands average 35 and highest in the mountainous region average 45 and is thus roughly negatively correlated to the absolute methane concentration table 4 no significant difference was found for the individual groundwater types although sampling was realized under controlled conditions some of the higher variations must certainly be attributed to field sampling procedures e g application of different pump types over the years the influence of fluid mixing due to varying positioning of the pump or changes of flow dynamics within the well on dissolved gas concentration is also a well known phenomenon gorody 2012 smith et al 2016 examining 12 domestic water wells revealed temporal variations to be related to seasonal changes in the regional water table elevation beyond that natural variations will account for observed differences as revealed by weak to moderate correlations with some redox parameters e g so4 or filter depth table 4 these variations are possibly a complex function of aquifer depth aquifer confinement and or permeability average seasonal rain meltwater and or local torrential rain percolating freshwater in the aquifer potentially changing redox conditions even fertilization with semi liquid manure not atypical for most of the rural areas can rapidly change boundary conditions for methanogenesis and or methanotrophy δ13cmethane is a potential indicator for a change in the gas source or mixing of different gases however methane is a non conservative gas and its isotopic composition is vulnerable to secondary alteration e g colosimo et al 2016 van stempvoort et al 2005 vinson et al 2017 wolfe and wilkin 2016 therefore the stability of observed isotopic composition is of prime importance and needs to be determined if used to flag possible changes due to potential stray gas intrusion into a pristine aquifer carbon isotope signatures of methane in the studied wells are stable among those samples with δ13cmethane values 60 which are generally also samples with abundances of dissolved methane in the upper range among our data set 80 of all samples are within 5 higher variations are inversely related to methane concentration spearman s rho 0 47 table 4 and become larger with decreasing δ13c spearman s rho 0 56 this is most suitably explained by microbial alteration e g wolfe and wilkin 2016 in general this confirms based on a much larger data set the observation by humez et al 2015 who reported δ13cmethane to often be a stable parameter while concentrations may vary one well sampled 10 times within 8 years 78 6 1 3 to the authors knowledge there has been no conclusive study focusing on possible variations in ethane and propane concentrations in groundwater so far within this study 789 wells have been sampled at least twice during consecutive years in 400 of them ethane concentration was consistently below detection limit considered as zero for 100 wells ethane was detected once but not in other analysis group i in fig 13 35 wells revealed 1 measurement with detection of ethane whereas other s were above quantification limit group ii the encircled samples iii relate to a well drilled into lower cretaceous shales showing consistently elevated ethane concentrations 250 μl l n 3 however in none of these samples propane was detected apparently computation of the coefficient of variation is hampered when many results are in range of the detection and or quantification limit e g one well with three or four measurements mathematically results in a coefficient of variation of 140 or 172 if one analysis is above this limit and the two or three are below zero thus we tentatively assign these larger variations to this constraint and will not further interpret them once exceeding the concentration range above twice the quantification limit the coefficient of variability is decreasing rapidly and much better than for methane for 82 of all wells with ethane concentrations 20 nl l the coefficient of variation is lower than 30 and thus being in the range of the error of measurement in 650 wells out of 789 wells with at least two measurements propane was never detected in additional 65 wells only once the remaining values reveal a similar stability of consecutive sampling periods data not shown 4 5 sensitivity of baseline values against stray gas influx beyond the initial scope of the study to provide regional background values of dissolved hydrocarbons and the genetic interpretation the acquired data additionally allow to assess the sensitivity of the base line data against a potential anthropogenic induced stray gas entry although there are several guidelines summarizing action levels and mitigation procedures once certain maximum permissible concentration levels of dissolved methane are exceeded e g eltschlager et al 2001 there are to our best knowledge no established regulatory standards for monitoring of dissolved methane in groundwater and criteria for anomaly detection limits assumedly most comparable are sniffer surveys related to off shore hydrocarbon exploration i e continuous measurements of hydrocarbons dissolved in sea water by means of towed sensors sometimes bulk signals of thermogenic hydrocarbons are used for anomaly detection lavering 1994 other surveys take advantage of component specific analysis e g logan et al 2010 two to five fold increases above the background values of individual c1 c4 hydrocarbons are considered as weak anomalies logan et al 2010 o brien et al 1992 assuming some simplifying boundary conditions e g upward migrating stray gas is not fractionated and a straightforward box model one can calculate the resulting change in hydrocarbon concentration and methane isotopic composition of the initial dissolved gases in an observation well in the absence of any guidelines regulations we test the sensitivity of the baseline data assuming two different scenarios and consider only wells which have been sampled analyzed at least twice to account for the natural variation in total 789 wells 538 with available δ13c value of methane the first scenario calculates the results based on a potential relative methane increase by 50 of the initial mean concentration the second scenario involves an absolute methane increase of 50 μl l in the groundwater which represents the 75 percentile of all methane background concentrations in our study we test the sensitivity against two different thermogenic gases a terrestrial sourced gas average δ13c 30 gas dryness 100 the most widespread source for natural gas in the study area and a marine gases δ13c 45 gas dryness 10 as criteria for positive anomaly detection we expect the resulting methane ethane and propane concentration to be larger than the initial mean concentration plus 2 standard deviations and the minimum change of methane δ13c should exceed 5 for ethane propane we apply a second conservative condition the resulting concentration should be higher than 10 times the quantification limit of 10 nl l in the first scenario relative increase in about 65 of all wells either the increased methane concentration or the change in isotopic composition would positively record an anomaly independent of the considered stray gas composition table 5 expected increases in ethane or propane concentrations are significant in 50 of all wells considering a marine sourced gas and in only 30 when considering a terrestrial sourced gas this difference is clearly related to the different gas compositions dryness ratio of both gases in general in about 25 of all wells none of the parameters would indicate a leakage it is important to point out that this is affecting wells where the initial methane and ethane propane concentration is extremely low 1 μl ch4 l with high variation large 2 sd criteria and δ13c is not available likewise the increase in c2 c3 might not exceed the conservative minimum concentration limit of 100 nl l when calculating the response due to an absolute increase of methane by 50 μl l and corresponding increase in c2 c3 concentrations scenario 2 the results are quite different the overall general sensitivity based on concentration or δ13c increases to about 80 in contrast to scenario 1 a detection based on methane data alone concentration isotopic composition is impossible when the initial concentration is high the threshold being around 750 μl l however when including ethane propane in the assessment a positive leakage detection is possible in all wells under consideration this is attributed to the significant increase in concentration of both species even considering a stray gas with a high dryness ratio this estimation shows that possible future regulations need to consider carefully which type of detection threshold is applied and how this affects the detectability of anthropogenic induced secondary enrichment in hydrocarbon gases 5 summary the high spatial variability of dissolved methane both in terms of concentration and isotopic composition is related to the complex hydrogeological situation of lower saxony in northern germany and can be linked to principal hydrogeological settings generally high methane concentrations frequently associated with traces of ethane and propane are encountered in estuarine marshes linked to high doc low sulfate and low oxygen concentrations methane concentrations in groundwater of the geest regions are variable and dominated by lower concentrations encountered in upper sandy aquifers associated with high oxygen nitrate and sulfate concentrations higher concentrations are commonly related to local peat bogs fens and meadow soils e g in the east frisian geest groundwater in deeper formations are typically low in organic carbon higher methane concentrations locally occur at in local aquitards associated with increased organic carbon periglacial lake sediments or associated with miocene brown coal sands higher methane concentrations in the lowlands occur in areas with large peat bogs fens western lowlands or when associated with interglacial sediments in the lowlands of the weser aller leine the amounts are mostly low dissolved methane concentration in the mountainous region is principally lower than in the lower saxony plain possibly due to high groundwater flow rates associated with elevated oxygen and nitrate concentrations absence of doc and increased sulfate concentrations a few sampled wells completed shortly above or in cretaceous fractured organic rich claystones can reveal higher concentrations of methane the isotopic compositions of methane vary strongly but the co occurrence of high concentrations and strong 13c depletion demonstrates a predominant origin of the methane from biogenic sources methanogenesis concentrations of oxygen nitrate sulfate hydrogen carbonate dissolved organic carbon and ammonia are in line with this interpretation and appear to principally control the occurrence of microbial methane on a magnitude scale methane oxidation occurs frequently and is indicated by partly strong 13c enrichments in methane and possibly related to the high permeability or input of oxygenated freshwater into the quaternary coarse grained sand this leads to oxidation even in deeper sands where mixing with methane rich groundwater can occur while no specific proxy to forecast methane concentrations is applicable combined interpretation of oxygen nitrate sulfate hydrogen carbonate dissolved organic carbon and ammonia might help to predict possible elevated concentrations of dissolved biogenic methane despite the large spatial variation the temporal changes in terms of dissolved gas concentration and methane isotopic signature are comparatively small highest variations are observed in shallow aquifers and or areas dominated by local groundwater flow associated with high freshwater recharge and where methane concentrations are low ethane and propane are detected unsystematically throughout the sampled wells mostly in trace amounts although contributions from thermogenic sources cannot completely be excluded a weak correlation with clearly microbially sourced methane concentrations indicates similar sources for all hydrocarbons modelling demonstrates that in contrast to methane both components are a very sensitive marker for possible mixing with natural gas in groundwater of lower saxony declaration of interest the authors certify that there is no actual or potential conflict of

8481,study region the arsenic as concentrations found in ong phra sub district dan chang district and suphan buri province are approx 20 times higher than the average concentration of as in agricultural soils of thailand study focus the objectives of this current study were to investigate the as contamination in soil and groundwater and further develop the risk assessment map of as from contaminated soils releasing to shallow groundwater by combining drastic method with contamination factor cf and mobility factor mf new hydrological insights for the region according to the sequential extraction result the concentrations of total as in 39 soil samples ranges from 4 8 to 1070 4 mg kg the highest as concentration in shallow groundwater was found at well number 3 located within 0 5 km downstream from the old tin mine the index of drastic groundwater vulnerability is in the range of 59 147 which is categorized into three vulnerability zones as follows low 100 moderate 100 130 and high 130 the high vulnerability area found along the waterway is approximately 35 km2 18 65 of the study area interestingly the drastic index of the old tin mine is indicated as the zone of moderate and high vulnerability the findings in this study reveal that the integration of the drastic risk map with cf can well elucidate as contaminated in shallow groundwater keywords arsenic contaminated soil groundwater old tin mine sequential extraction 1 introduction arsenic as is one of the most toxic substances foundin the environment exposure to sufficiently high concentrations of as in the natural environment such as in surface water groundwater sediment and soil has proven to be harmful to human health and the ecosystem a significant route for as exposure is the consumption of groundwater which has been reported from different parts of the world bhattacharya et al 1997 2002 chotpantarat et al 2014 muhammad and muhammad 2011 quazi et al 2011 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 wongsasuluk et al 2018a b zhiyuan et al 2014 in the case of abandoned mines the mining waste consists of roaster piles tailings ponds waste rock piles and acidic mine water alshaebi et al 2009 percolation from the tailing ponds can leak and eventually contaminate the groundwater system and move down gradient from the ponds the main toxic metal concentrations of concern are as iron fe cadmium cd copper cu lead pb manganese mn nickel ni and zinc zn with levels exceeding the water quality criteria in the stream around mining areas wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 alshaebi et al 2009 chotpantarat et al 2015 boonsrang et al 2017 arsenic is usually an unusable by product that can be introduced into the environment through the natural process of erosion of mineral deposits or through the mining and milling of these deposits most tin ores are found in alluvial deposits and mining operations by dredging and gravel pumping which use water for the mechanical separation of tin ore from the tin bearing earth the tailings therefore are grouped into two main types consisting of slime and sand including gravel as a minor proportion tanpibal and sahunalu 1989 the coarser materials are found close to the discharge point with a continuous gradation to fine particles at the lower end of the slope these form the fan shaped tailings thailand is one of several countries in southeast asia having problems with tin residue the waste piles resulting from tin mining contain high as as arsenopyrite the original case study from a few decades ago discovered at ron phibun sub district nakhon si thammarat a province in the southern part of thailand smedley and kinniburgh 2002 williams et al 1996 that health problems were first recognized in the area in 1987 approximately 1000 people have been diagnosed with as related skin disorders particularly in and close to ron phibun town choprapawon and rodcline 1997 fordyce et al 1995 williams et al 1996 the affected area lies within the south east asian tin belt schwartz et al 1995 arsenic concentrations are found at up to 5000 μg l in shallow groundwater from the quaternary alluvial sediment that has been extensively dredged during tin mining operations moreover the result of the measurement of as content in water and soils in another old tin mine at dan chang suphan buri finds as contamination in the soils and tap water pansamut and wattayakorn 2010 specifically the result from a health risk assessment of as contamination in a project in 2010 at ong phra sub district revealed that people have a carcinogenic risk from as exposure the drastic method commonly used for assessing aquifer vulnerability was developed by aller et al 1987 recently many studies have developed the risk assessment by combining the aquifer vulnerability from drastic konkul et al 2014 and the potential release of contamination sources mainly focusing on nitrate and pesticides in agricultural areas gonzalez et al 1997 goodarzi and javadi 2016 hamutoko et al 2016 kisaka and lema 2016 mondal et al 2017 zghibi et al 2016 however few studies hamutoko et al 2016 mondal et al 2017 have not been supported by field measurement especially heavy metal concentrations in soil and groundwater to check their reliability of risk assessment map therefore the objectives of this current study were to investigate the as concentrations in soil and groundwater in ong phra sub district suphan buri province and further develop the risk assessment map of as from contaminated soils releasing to shallow groundwater by combining drastic method with the different approaches of potential leaching assessment of as both contamination factor cf and mobility factor mf finally the reliability of the integration of the vulnerability of the area and potential leaching of as in the study area was investigated to proof the reliable result of this technique and can be applied to delineate the risk assessment map of groundwater contamination in this area 2 the study area dan chang is the northwestern district of suphan buri province fig 1 and is located between latitudes 14 49 22 14 50 32 n and longitudes 99 21 12 99 22 22 e the terrain of dan chang is high mountainous ranges in the west and undulating to rolling terrain and slope down to the east annual rainfall in dan chang district is 915 34 mm ong phra sub district is one of seven sub districts in dan chang with a population of about 7000 people who are mainly in the agricultural sector the old tin mine in ong phra sub district is approximately 80 km west of dan chang district and south west of the old mine is sombut jarern sub district nong prue district kanchanaburi province the old mine areas are clustered in 13 pits as shown in fig 1 geology and hydrogeology of the study area are classified by secondary data such as rock types well log of groundwater exploration obtained from the department of mineral resources dmr and the department of groundwater resources dgr geology of the study area mostly comprises terrain and colluvium deposits of quaternary age and ordovician limestone as shown in fig 2 a hydrogeologic units in the study area consist of two main types of aquifer which are unconsolidated and consolidated media the hydrogeological map fig 2 b shows the unconsolidated aquifers in colluvium qcl and terrain deposit qt units and the consolidated aquifers in granite ordovician limestone ols and silurian devonian metamorphic sdmm and permo carboniferus metasedimentary pcms units groundwater samples are collected in shallow wells mainly located in the terrain deposit aquifer qt 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater and soil sampling locations approximately 39 selected soil samples were collected at the old mining site in ong phra sub district dan chang district suphan buri province which covering upstream and downstream parts of the mining site as shown in fig 1 top soil samples were taken at the 15 cm depth soils were dried overnight and sieved through a 2 mm sieve to eliminate stones and other materials like litter extraneous to soil and then stored in polyethylene bags at room temperature prior to each analysis the sampling of groundwater was focused on wells currently in use which consisted of 7 private ring wells and 14 public tube wells the depth to groundwater table was measured by electrical groundwater level and a groundwater sample was then pumped through a flow through cell containing multi measuring probes to measure groundwater parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp the initial 5 10 min of pumped water was discarded and then groundwater samples were collected in rinsed polyethylene bottles the collected groundwater samples then were divided into 2 bottles the first bottle had nitric acid concentrated hno3 added to keep the ph of the groundwater samples less than 2 prior to metal content analysis the other was collected to analyze anions and cations all samples were stored immediately in a cooled container and kept below 4 c until analysis 3 2 sequential extraction the sequential extraction procedure was followed based on the bcr protocol three steps sequential extraction proposed by the community bureau of reference pueyo et al 2001 rauret et al 1999 the water soluble and residual fractions were also considered nannoni et al 2011 the five steps of the sequential extraction procedure were taken to define the partitioning of as in the water and were as follows soluble fsol extractable fext reducible fred oxidable foxi and residual fractions fres the sequential extraction procedure was performed using 1 g of soil sample in a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube following reaction with the extraction reagent of each step the mixture was centrifuged to separate the supernatant and the residue the supernatant was used for analytical determinations and the residue was washed with deionized water and dried prior to the next extraction step 3 3 analysis of groundwater and soil samples preserved groundwater samples and extracted soil solutions were analyzed by using a graphite furnace atomic absorption thermo science ice3000 gfaas a master standard solution containing 1000 mg l of as was obtained from accutrace reference standard deionized water used throughout this analyses was obtained from the elga purelab classic di the conductivity of the water used was 18 mohms cm the limit of detection was 1 μg per liter μg l for a sample volume of 100 microliters with deuterium d₂ background correction resulting in clearer absorption spectra and easier analysis 3 4 groundwater vulnerability assessment by drastic model morris and foster 2000 defined groundwater pollution risk as the probability that groundwater will become contaminated to an unacceptable level by human activities on the immediately overlying land surface they described groundwater risk assessment as the processes used to predict the possibility of groundwater contamination from pollutants the concept of groundwater vulnerability can be defined as the possibility of percolation and diffusion of contaminants from the ground surface into the groundwater system groundwater vulnerability is usually considered an intrinsic property of a groundwater system depending on its sensitivity to anthropogenic and natural impacts the integrated groundwater vulnerability combines the intrinsic vulnerability with the risk of the groundwater which is generally exposed to the loading of pollutants from certain sources the drastic model was developed by the u s environmental protection agency epa to evaluate groundwater pollution potential for the entire united states as proposed by aller et al 1987 drastic methodology is based on a weighting and rating method that assesses vulnerability by means of seven parameters as follows 1 depth to groundwater table d 2 net recharge r 3 aquifer media a 4 soil media s 5 topography t 6 impact of vadose zone media i 7 hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer c each of the hydrogeological parameters is assigned a rating from 1 to 10 based upon a range of values the ratings are then multiplied by a relative weight ranging from 1 to 5 table 1 the most significant factors have a weight of 5 and the least significant have a weight of 1 the source of data for the seven parameters is shown in table si 1 a field study for groundwater table levels and secondary data was obtained from different sources and formats as shown in table si 1 the layer of the drastic model used as the weighting score was the original scoring from the study of aller et al 1987 except the weighting of net recharge was applied the method of piscopo 2001 weightings of each parameter are shown in table 1 following the preparation of the parameters above the rate and weight of such parameters were interpolated by the inverse distance weighted method idw which estimated cell values by averaging the values of nearby sample data points the theme table of shape file shp was the z value used in spatial interpolation operated with the nearest neighbor using the default power of 2 3 5 groundwater risk assessment risk of groundwater contamination was estimated by combining the groundwater vulnerability of the area with potential pollution load at each location foster and hirata 1988 estimated the risk of groundwater contamination from the interaction between aquifer vulnerability and the surface pollution load the risk of the aquifer was calculated by the arithmetic product of the indexes of the aquifer vulnerability times the pollution load as shown in the following equation gonzalez et al 1997 r l v where r refers to risk value l refers to potential pollution load v refers to groundwater vulnerability the risk values were classified into 4 levels as follows low medium high and very high value and used further to identify the area at risk the cf was used to indicate the degree of environmental contamination abrahim and parker 2008 and evaluate anthropogenic influences of heavy metals in sediments uluturhan 2010 the cf was calculated as the ratio between the sediment metal content at a given station and average shale values of the metal krauskopf 1985 the cf was measured by the following equation hakanson 1980 cf cm cn where cf refers to contamination factor cm refers to concentration of each metal in the soil cn refers to baseline or background value of the specific metal the mobility potential and bioavailability of heavy metals and metalloids in soils was assessed by using a mobility factor mf index calculated on the basis of the following equation nannoni et al 2011 m f f s o l f e x t f s o l f e x t f r e d f o x i f r e s 100 the factor calculated by percentage of solubility fraction plus extractable fraction and divide by the sum of 5 fractions 4 results and discussion physiographically dan chang sub district mostly is flat and can be divided into the high hills of the phu toei national park and the flat plain area see fig 1 the north border area is a hilly terrain whereas the north east and south west areas are separated by mountain and ridge groundwater in the area occurs in the shallow terrain deposit aquifer and in the deeper aquifer the groundwater flows in the north south direction in each sub watershed the topography and groundwater flow indicated the flow passed through the old mine from the north to the southeastern terrain figure si 1 4 1 groundwater levels and hydrogeochemical characteristics the level of shallow wells decreased in the dry season however some wells such as well numbers 5 and 6 were high and flow direction was unchanged figure si 1 and table 2 chemical parameters of groundwater of wet and dry events are shown in table 2 the groundwater ph was slightly acidic and ranged from 5 20 to 5 90 with an average ph of 5 50 and 5 60 for the wet and dry seasons respectively an average electrical conductivity ec was 633 and 638 μs cm for the wet and dry seasons respectively additionally the oxidation potential eh was in the range of 250 370 mv with an average of approximately 313 mv and eh was slightly higher in the dry season 280 mv 390 mv with an average of 327 mv the dissolved oxygen do was in the range of 4 3 4 8 mg l with an average of approximately 4 5 mg l in the wet season and the do tending to decrease in the dry season with an average of approximately 3 3 mg l in the range from 2 1 to 5 8 mg l the concentration of eight major cations and anions na k mg² ca² cl co₃ ² hco₃ and so₄ ² are given in table 3 all ions were plotted as the piper trilinear diagram by grouping the na with k and the co₃ ² with hco₃ the piper trilinear diagram was very useful for classifying the hydrochemical facies of the water samples according to their dominant ions the water type in the area was mainly classified as ca hco₃ water figure si 2 or typical shallow fresh groundwater groundwater with calcium as the dominant cation and bicarbonate as the dominant anion the ca hco₃ water type indicated areas of fresh recharge mondal et al 2011 olobaniyi et al 2007 saxena et al 2003 and might have originated from a co₂ charged rainstorm which produced weak carbonic acid that later dissociated into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions tijani et al 2006 4 2 arsenic in shallow groundwater wells well number 3 was notable for the as concentration both during the dry and wet seasons high as were 14 μg l and 6 μg l for wet and dry respectively the as concentration in the other 6 wells was below the limit of detection in the wet season but tended to be higher in the dry season however these were not over 1 μg l the result showed that the concentrations of as in the dry season were higher than those in the wet season in the study area due to dilution by rainwater since groundwater recharge in the wet season was similar to the study of buragohain et al 2010 the ca hco₃ water type indicated areas of fresh recharge acidic groundwater in this area with the oxidation potential in the range of 270 390 mv leading to as probably in the form of ionized arsenate h₂aso₄ as shown in fig 3 based on as concentrations in the deep wells the highest concentrations of as were found in the southeast study area at well numbers 10 and 11 while the relatively lower and non detectable as were in the north of study area according to the eh ph plot as in groundwater in the deep wells was probably in the ionized arsenate haso₄ ² form which was clearly a different form ionized arsenate h₂aso₄ found in the shallow wells the adsorption of as decreased as the ph increased over the ph 6 9 range saxena et al 2005 usgs 2016 therefore the deep wells with a high ph 7 16 had higher concentrations of as compared to those of shallow wells with average values from 5 5 to 5 6 in dry and wet seasons respectively an average electrical conductivity value was 642 μs cm and ranged from 197 to 798 μs cm furthermore the oxidation potential eh was in the range of 286 423 mv with an average of approximately 356 mv the dissolved oxygen do was in the range of 2 50 3 80 with an average of approximately 3 14 mg l see supplemental material table s1 arsenious acid h₃aso₃ was predominant only at extremely low ph 2 in oxygenated water systems whereas in the range of 2 11 ph as existed in the form of h₂aso₄ and haso₄ ² gong et al 2006 the oxidation of arsenopyrites as shown in eq 1 released a relatively high amount of as in the leachate blowes et al 1998 1 feass s 1 5h₂o 2 75o₂ aq fe² h₃aso₃ aq so₄ ² 4 3 soil sequential extraction the five steps sequential extraction procedure was carried out to define the partitioning of as as follows the water soluble extractable reducible oxidable and residual fractions the statistics for as in the soil of 39 samples is given in table 4 the as distribution in top soils of dan chang is shown in fig 4 and spatial distribution maps of as in each fraction are shown in fig 5 the soil samples of the old mine fell under toxic and alert categories with respect to as since some of the samples exceeded the guideline of pollution control department thailand arsenic in soil did not exceed 3 9 mg kg for habitat and agriculture and did not exceed 27 mg kg for other purposes based on the previous study mandal and suzuki 2002 the as content in soils from thailand was approximately 9 1 6 7 mg kg it also was observed that the groundwater sample well number 3 adjacent to the foothills contained as at a toxic level since the study area was within an alluvial basin the most probable natural sources of as in groundwater might have been a heavy deposition of sediments due to surface erosion from surrounding hills creating aquifers however this area might have undergone long term influences by anthropogenic sources like the old tin mining site average concentrations of total as in soils table 4 exceeded 30 mg kg over the background concentration of as in surface soils 0 15 cm of thailand sukreeyapongse et al 2009 especially soil samples from the old tin mine areas otm which were in the range of 52 12 1070 42 mg kg with an average of 370 82 mg kg the distribution map of as contaminated areas was rasterized by the inverse distance method idw the distribution map of total as shows that as did not distribute evenly fig 5 the high as concentrations were mainly located around the old tin mine area the distribution of the soluble as was mainly in the downstream area with the highest as concentration of 0 43 mg kg in the southern part of the study area at ban sambat charern sampling site number 35 as shown in fig 6 a it was not evenly distributed over the area because many soil sampling points were not detected in the soluble form the distribution of the extractable as as shown in fig 6 b was like that of soluble as the distribution of the extractable as was mainly in the downstream area with the highest as concentration of 1 37 mg kg at ban sambat charern sub district sampling site number 35 an additional cause for high as levels could be due to the use of fertilizers and pesticides in crops in this area such as phosphate fertilizers especially on sugar cane corn cassava and rice davis 1993 donga and eklo 2018 khan et al 2018 the distribution map shows fairly high as concentration at the old tin mine area with the highest concentration of 23 50 mg kg at soil sampling site number 10 for the reducible form as shown in fig 6 c the reducible form is as fixed in fe and or mn oxides such as feaso₄ xh₂o scorodite van herreweghe et al 2003 therefore this form might come from tin mine tailings the distribution map of oxidable as was not evenly distributed as shown in fig 6 d and it was high around the old tin mine area with an average of 32 68 mg kg table 4 the highest value exceeds up to 79 50 mg kg at soil sampling site no 10 where is located not far from of the old tin mine 2 km in the downstream direction indicating that this high as concentration areas were affected from the sediment deposition of contaminated soils or tailings from the old tin mine the distribution of residual as the final fraction of sequential extraction as shown in fig 6 e is similar to the distribution of the oxidisable fraction the 4th fraction and total as see fig 5 because the value of total as content is mainly from the value of residual as according to the study of lee et al 2012 as is primarily bound to the residual phase 95 6 of total as concentration for tungsten mine tailings 4 4 drastic vulnerability map the vulnerability map was based on the drastic index di which was computed as the weighted sum overlay of the seven layers using the following equation aller et al 1987 drastic index di drdw rrrw araw srsw trtw iriw crcw where d depth to water r net recharge a aquifer media s soil media t topography i impact of the vadose zone c hydraulic conductivity 4 4 1 depth to water depth to water refers to the depth to the water surface in an unconfined aquifer deeper water table levels indicate lesser chance to be contaminated by the pollutants rating values for water depths were assigned based upon the assumption that a shallower water table is more chances to be polluted from the ground surface activities the depth of water in the study area varied between 2 03 m mainly located in the central parts for the terrece deposit qt and collovial deposit aquifers qcl to 16 52 m below the ground surface in ordovician ols and granitic aquifers gr located in the west northern and east parts of the study area the rating scores ranged between 3 and 9 where the highest scores were in the west northern part and the lowest scores were in the central discharge area which are presented in table 5 the spatial variation is shown in fig 7 a depth to water table in study area has a high rating in the plain areas between the mountain ranges 4 4 2 recharge recharge indicates the amount of water per unit area of land which penetrates the ground surface and reaches to the groundwater table recharge water is available to transport a contaminant vertically to the groundwater table in essence horizontal with an aquifer since there is no available data of net recharge for the current study area therefore it could be estimated by a sum of slope soil permeability and rainfall according to the method proposed by piscopo 2001 and applied by many studies al rawabdeh et al 2013 kamlesh and shukla 2014 recharge was calculated using the following formula recharge value slope rainfall soil permeability the data of average annual rainfall in suphan buri and kanchanaburi from 9 stations around the study area was obtained from meteorological department thailand the rainfall distributed from northeast to southwest in the range of 830 1070 mm after interpolation of rainfall data parameters and recharge value for the study area was measured using data given in tables 5 and s2 net recharge range and rating is shown in fig 7 b the high rating of net recharge rating score of 10 is in the plain area and the high rating corresponds to a high potential for groundwater pollution 4 4 3 aquifer media aquifer media refers to properties of the saturated zone medium either in consolidated or unconsolidated aquifer which dominates fate and transport of pollutants and is associated with the retention time in groundwater system due to several processes such as sorption dispersion oxidation and biodegradation during the pollutants flowing in the aquifer the larger than grain size medium and more fractures or openings within an aquifer led to higher permeability and lower attenuation capacity hence greater pollution potential the high rating of aquifer media in the study area related to unconsolidated aquifers such as terrace deposits qt and colluvium deposit qcl aquifers which has a rating of 8 while the granitic gr and metamorphic rocks aquifers sdmm has a rating of 4 table 5 the map shown in fig 7 c the central study area demonstrates a great pollution potential 4 4 4 soil media soil media refers to the uppermost weathered portion of the vadose zone characterized by both significant chemical and biological activities the infiltration and leaching potential of pollutants into the groundwater environment is majorly affected by the soil texture including permeability characteristics masipan et al 2016 when soils mainly consist of sand recharge water including pollutants will take a short period of time to reach groundwater rating of soil media in the study area is given in table 5 the highest score rating was loamy sandy soils with a value of 9 and the lowest value of 1 was clay which was found in the complex slope area in general the loamy sand soil mainly consists of sand 70 causing it more porous and permeable in contrast the clay soil is tightly compacted and the pores are not completely connected thus the loamy sandy soils would be more vulnerable than clay soil the soil media map is shown in fig s 3 rate of soil type map shows that the high rate areas were in the vicinity of the stream as shown in fig 7 d and the low rate area related to soil group 62 which had complex slopes in mountain and forest areas 4 4 5 topography topography refers to the slope or steepness of the land surface it helps whether polluted water is moved by runoff or remains on the ground surface long enough to infiltrate after raining the slope index was derived from the digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution areas with steep slope generally generate surface runoff and polluted water and has less potential to release into the groundwater while areas with low slope commonly retain the water body as a pond and polluted water has long enough period of time to reach into the subsurface environment the ratings assigned in the study are presented in table 5 and spatial distributions of slope are presented as fig 7 e the slope values were categorized and rated values in the range of 1 to 10 the study area has a slope of 0 2 the flat area with a high rating of 10 where mostly are located in the plain in the central area while the area with a slope of more than 18 mainly in the northern part of the study area can classify with a minimum rating of 1 4 4 6 impact of the vadose zone impact of the vadose zone is defined as unsaturated zone material above the groundwater level according to the study of aller et al 1987 and other previous studies rahman 2008 senthilkumar and babu 2014 which defined that the impact of the vadose zone depends upon the matrix or types of the soil media the significantly restrictive zone above an aquifer forming the confining layers used in a confined aquifer the type of soil media above the aquifer had the most significant impact since it controls the migration of pollutants before reaching the aquifers according to the drastic ratings the value of impact of vadose zone is shown in table 5 and spatial variations are presented as fig 7 f the characteristics of the material including the rock above the water table are gravel silt clay laterite metamorphic and granite quaternary sediments mainly represent the material in the central plain with a rating of 6 which is more vulnerable than the vadose zone composing of volcanic and metamorphic rocks with a rating of 5 quaternary sediments has a higher rating score because they are unconsolidated media and can be more chemically and biologically weathering thus the pollutants could pass through them easier as compare with volcanic and metamorphic rocks 4 4 7 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity is considered as the ability of an aquifer to transmit water that controls the rate at which groundwater flows under a given hydraulic gradient the hydraulic conductivity ranged between 0 02 and 10 89 m day except ordovician limestone with a wide range value in the study area see figure s4 the ratings based on hydraulic conductivity are shown in table 5 due to the lack of the hydraulic conductivity data in the study area therefore the hydraulic properties were classified based on the aquifer types from the hydrogeological map with the rating values of 1 and 2 the ordovician limestone colluvial deposits and terrace deposits were rated with the value of 2 which is more vulnerable than granite permian carboniferous and silurian devonian metamorphic rock the hydraulic conductivity map and spatial distribution are shown in fig 7 g 4 4 8 drastic vulnerability map in general the possible drastic index ranges from 23 to 226 bonfanti et al 2016 souleymane and zhonghua 2017 the value of the drastic index represents a comparative sensitivity measurement the more drastic index is the more sensitive to groundwater pollution presents in such area in this study area the index score of groundwater vulnerability assessment ranged from 59 to 147 which are reasonable to be divided into 3 zones as follows low index 100 moderate index 100 130 and high index 130 moreover the results of such categories can found that each zone was separated clearly in addition there are many studies which found the range of drastic index is similar to our study most of them divided their areas into 3 zones low medium and high as well babiker et al 2005 ersoy and gültekin 2013 prasad and shukla 2014 rahman 2008 senthilkumar and babu 2014 for example the study of ersoy and gültekin 2013 determined the drastic index ranging from 58 to 177 and classified the vulnerability map into 3 classes low 100 medium 100 140 and high 140 approximately 18 65 of the area showed high vulnerability and about 34 88 showed moderate vulnerability and 46 47 of the area showed low vulnerability the highly vulnerable areas were located along the creek or waterway while the plain area had moderate vulnerability and the mountain area was low in vulnerability fig 8 the spatial distribution of as in shallow groundwaterduring wet and dry seasons had similar distribution patterns fig s5 conversely the result of as in tube wells deep was generally located in the siltstone and sandstone aquifers at the depth of 12 m 62 m there were two wells with high concentrations located at the southeast of study area at well numbers 10 and 11 which were 43 and 27 μg l respectively while the relatively lower and non detected levels were in the north of study area including the abandoned tin mine fig s5 different as concentrations in shallow and deep aquifers of the study area might explain that these two aquifers were a different groundwater system especially at the deep aquifer of the southeast area covered by thick clay as a confining layer 4 5 mobility factor mf and contamination factor cf the 39 soil samples were analyzed for total as and sequential extraction the concentration of total as in soil at the old tin mining area were in the range between 4 80 mg kg to 1070 40 mg kg according to the study by sukreeyapongse et al 2009 after mine closure for 5 years the reported total as in soils was in the range of 8 96 92 35 mg kg the other old tin mine in the south of thailand at ron phibun district nakhon si thammarat province had total as in soil in the range of 2 53 151 mg kg the results of sequential extraction were mostly in the oxidable and residual fractions as shown in fig 9 mobility of heavy metals in soils that dominated their distribution and behavior in soil the mobility of heavy elements in soils became assessed through the use of a mf nannoni et al 2011 defined as the sum of the percentage of solubility fraction fsol and extractable fraction fext divided by the sum of total 5 fractionations the mf of this area was relatively high at the southern part of the study area outside the old mine figure s 6 which separated to other sub watersheds of the old mine as shown as distribution map figure s 6 a the old mine area had very low mf since the fractions had a high ratio of the immobilized form the other fractions of soil extraction such as soluble extractable and reducible were not over the national limited value at 3 9 mg kg soil texture was one of the important factors that could influence as mobility fitz and wenzel 2002 quazi et al 2011 generally clay or fine texture soils had much more surface area than coarse or sandy soils sand quartz was expected to facilitate greater as leaching or loss with runoff thus the soil with high amounts of clay such as clay clay loam and sandy clay loam could adsorb as however some samples with low amounts of clay had high as content sampling site numbers 12 and 16 which were sandy soil at the mine area similarly the study of zulfahmi et al 2012 also analyzed tailing sand by xrd for indicating the presence of arsenopyrite realgar chalcopyrite pyrite hematite and quartz minerals the as from the sequential extraction had different forms proposed by van herreweghe et al 2003 most as in mineral forms were in the reducible oxidable and residual forms which consisted of scorodite feaso₄ xh₂o realgar ass and orpiment as₂s₃ as well as löllingite feas₂ respectively contamination factor cf was used for indicating degree of environmental contamination abrahim and parker 2008 the cf of as contamination in soil samples divided by shale values were 6 6 mg kg as a background value of as the cf of the study area was in the range of 0 73 162 18 with the spatial distribution map shown in fig 9 b cf values were interpreted as suggested by hakanson hakanson 1980 where cf 1 indicated low contamination 1 cf 3 was moderate contamination 3 cf 6 was considerable contamination and cf 6 was very high contamination therefore the values showed that most of the area had very high contamination of as according to hakanson s cf classification according to the classification areas covering the considerable contamination 3 cf 6 and very high contamination cf 6 mainly were located in the old mine area see fig 9 b 4 6 risk assessment map taken from the index of drastic vulnerability a summary of 7 parameters shown in fig 8 the weak zones distributed as spots along the plain area specifically a part of the old tin mine had a drastic score in the range of highly vulnerable moreover as was found in highly vulnerable zones when taking into consideration sampled wells and the vulnerability map to see wells with high concentration of total as the locations and distances of villages adjacent to the old tin mine are shown in the risk maps fig 10 and table 6 to evaluate the risk of pollution the map of the cf of as had to be integrated and overlaid with the vulnerability map indeed the risk map using cf and drastic map shows zones of moderate high and very high risk around the old mine as shown in fig 10 conversely the risk map using mf and drastic map shows high and very high risk in the center of the study area fig 10 a the risk map generated with cf shows a high risk to contaminate in the shallow groundwater since well number 3 was located within a short distance 0 5 km in the downstream direction from the very high risk zone this was consistent with the previous 2010 research on health risk assessment of as contamination in this area done by probabilistic risk assessment pra indicating that 2 sub districts ong phra and wang kun were at risk of cancer due to as exposure 5 conclusions risk of as from contaminated soil to shallow groundwater depends on the vulnerability and potential for as in contaminated soils the old tin mine areas have high vulnerability but the release potential of as is low because as is mostly in oxidable and residual fractions the risk assessment maps were created by overlaying drastic map with either the mf map or cf map although the areas of highly contaminated soil have a low mf the risk map made with the cf shows a higher correlation with as in the shallow groundwater than that of the risk map from mf otherwise total as in contaminated soil influences the shallow aquifer more than the mf from the first two fractions from the sequential extraction the results of this research show the good relationship between the as contamination in shallow groundwater contamination and the cf however the risk map from the mf is also important to indicate the contaminated areas where as is distributed into the other phase such as surface water and plants which might affect health moreover the high vulnerability of the area with high as content in soil will be at risk if the area is continuously re

8481,study region the arsenic as concentrations found in ong phra sub district dan chang district and suphan buri province are approx 20 times higher than the average concentration of as in agricultural soils of thailand study focus the objectives of this current study were to investigate the as contamination in soil and groundwater and further develop the risk assessment map of as from contaminated soils releasing to shallow groundwater by combining drastic method with contamination factor cf and mobility factor mf new hydrological insights for the region according to the sequential extraction result the concentrations of total as in 39 soil samples ranges from 4 8 to 1070 4 mg kg the highest as concentration in shallow groundwater was found at well number 3 located within 0 5 km downstream from the old tin mine the index of drastic groundwater vulnerability is in the range of 59 147 which is categorized into three vulnerability zones as follows low 100 moderate 100 130 and high 130 the high vulnerability area found along the waterway is approximately 35 km2 18 65 of the study area interestingly the drastic index of the old tin mine is indicated as the zone of moderate and high vulnerability the findings in this study reveal that the integration of the drastic risk map with cf can well elucidate as contaminated in shallow groundwater keywords arsenic contaminated soil groundwater old tin mine sequential extraction 1 introduction arsenic as is one of the most toxic substances foundin the environment exposure to sufficiently high concentrations of as in the natural environment such as in surface water groundwater sediment and soil has proven to be harmful to human health and the ecosystem a significant route for as exposure is the consumption of groundwater which has been reported from different parts of the world bhattacharya et al 1997 2002 chotpantarat et al 2014 muhammad and muhammad 2011 quazi et al 2011 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 wongsasuluk et al 2018a b zhiyuan et al 2014 in the case of abandoned mines the mining waste consists of roaster piles tailings ponds waste rock piles and acidic mine water alshaebi et al 2009 percolation from the tailing ponds can leak and eventually contaminate the groundwater system and move down gradient from the ponds the main toxic metal concentrations of concern are as iron fe cadmium cd copper cu lead pb manganese mn nickel ni and zinc zn with levels exceeding the water quality criteria in the stream around mining areas wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 alshaebi et al 2009 chotpantarat et al 2015 boonsrang et al 2017 arsenic is usually an unusable by product that can be introduced into the environment through the natural process of erosion of mineral deposits or through the mining and milling of these deposits most tin ores are found in alluvial deposits and mining operations by dredging and gravel pumping which use water for the mechanical separation of tin ore from the tin bearing earth the tailings therefore are grouped into two main types consisting of slime and sand including gravel as a minor proportion tanpibal and sahunalu 1989 the coarser materials are found close to the discharge point with a continuous gradation to fine particles at the lower end of the slope these form the fan shaped tailings thailand is one of several countries in southeast asia having problems with tin residue the waste piles resulting from tin mining contain high as as arsenopyrite the original case study from a few decades ago discovered at ron phibun sub district nakhon si thammarat a province in the southern part of thailand smedley and kinniburgh 2002 williams et al 1996 that health problems were first recognized in the area in 1987 approximately 1000 people have been diagnosed with as related skin disorders particularly in and close to ron phibun town choprapawon and rodcline 1997 fordyce et al 1995 williams et al 1996 the affected area lies within the south east asian tin belt schwartz et al 1995 arsenic concentrations are found at up to 5000 μg l in shallow groundwater from the quaternary alluvial sediment that has been extensively dredged during tin mining operations moreover the result of the measurement of as content in water and soils in another old tin mine at dan chang suphan buri finds as contamination in the soils and tap water pansamut and wattayakorn 2010 specifically the result from a health risk assessment of as contamination in a project in 2010 at ong phra sub district revealed that people have a carcinogenic risk from as exposure the drastic method commonly used for assessing aquifer vulnerability was developed by aller et al 1987 recently many studies have developed the risk assessment by combining the aquifer vulnerability from drastic konkul et al 2014 and the potential release of contamination sources mainly focusing on nitrate and pesticides in agricultural areas gonzalez et al 1997 goodarzi and javadi 2016 hamutoko et al 2016 kisaka and lema 2016 mondal et al 2017 zghibi et al 2016 however few studies hamutoko et al 2016 mondal et al 2017 have not been supported by field measurement especially heavy metal concentrations in soil and groundwater to check their reliability of risk assessment map therefore the objectives of this current study were to investigate the as concentrations in soil and groundwater in ong phra sub district suphan buri province and further develop the risk assessment map of as from contaminated soils releasing to shallow groundwater by combining drastic method with the different approaches of potential leaching assessment of as both contamination factor cf and mobility factor mf finally the reliability of the integration of the vulnerability of the area and potential leaching of as in the study area was investigated to proof the reliable result of this technique and can be applied to delineate the risk assessment map of groundwater contamination in this area 2 the study area dan chang is the northwestern district of suphan buri province fig 1 and is located between latitudes 14 49 22 14 50 32 n and longitudes 99 21 12 99 22 22 e the terrain of dan chang is high mountainous ranges in the west and undulating to rolling terrain and slope down to the east annual rainfall in dan chang district is 915 34 mm ong phra sub district is one of seven sub districts in dan chang with a population of about 7000 people who are mainly in the agricultural sector the old tin mine in ong phra sub district is approximately 80 km west of dan chang district and south west of the old mine is sombut jarern sub district nong prue district kanchanaburi province the old mine areas are clustered in 13 pits as shown in fig 1 geology and hydrogeology of the study area are classified by secondary data such as rock types well log of groundwater exploration obtained from the department of mineral resources dmr and the department of groundwater resources dgr geology of the study area mostly comprises terrain and colluvium deposits of quaternary age and ordovician limestone as shown in fig 2 a hydrogeologic units in the study area consist of two main types of aquifer which are unconsolidated and consolidated media the hydrogeological map fig 2 b shows the unconsolidated aquifers in colluvium qcl and terrain deposit qt units and the consolidated aquifers in granite ordovician limestone ols and silurian devonian metamorphic sdmm and permo carboniferus metasedimentary pcms units groundwater samples are collected in shallow wells mainly located in the terrain deposit aquifer qt 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater and soil sampling locations approximately 39 selected soil samples were collected at the old mining site in ong phra sub district dan chang district suphan buri province which covering upstream and downstream parts of the mining site as shown in fig 1 top soil samples were taken at the 15 cm depth soils were dried overnight and sieved through a 2 mm sieve to eliminate stones and other materials like litter extraneous to soil and then stored in polyethylene bags at room temperature prior to each analysis the sampling of groundwater was focused on wells currently in use which consisted of 7 private ring wells and 14 public tube wells the depth to groundwater table was measured by electrical groundwater level and a groundwater sample was then pumped through a flow through cell containing multi measuring probes to measure groundwater parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp the initial 5 10 min of pumped water was discarded and then groundwater samples were collected in rinsed polyethylene bottles the collected groundwater samples then were divided into 2 bottles the first bottle had nitric acid concentrated hno3 added to keep the ph of the groundwater samples less than 2 prior to metal content analysis the other was collected to analyze anions and cations all samples were stored immediately in a cooled container and kept below 4 c until analysis 3 2 sequential extraction the sequential extraction procedure was followed based on the bcr protocol three steps sequential extraction proposed by the community bureau of reference pueyo et al 2001 rauret et al 1999 the water soluble and residual fractions were also considered nannoni et al 2011 the five steps of the sequential extraction procedure were taken to define the partitioning of as in the water and were as follows soluble fsol extractable fext reducible fred oxidable foxi and residual fractions fres the sequential extraction procedure was performed using 1 g of soil sample in a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube following reaction with the extraction reagent of each step the mixture was centrifuged to separate the supernatant and the residue the supernatant was used for analytical determinations and the residue was washed with deionized water and dried prior to the next extraction step 3 3 analysis of groundwater and soil samples preserved groundwater samples and extracted soil solutions were analyzed by using a graphite furnace atomic absorption thermo science ice3000 gfaas a master standard solution containing 1000 mg l of as was obtained from accutrace reference standard deionized water used throughout this analyses was obtained from the elga purelab classic di the conductivity of the water used was 18 mohms cm the limit of detection was 1 μg per liter μg l for a sample volume of 100 microliters with deuterium d₂ background correction resulting in clearer absorption spectra and easier analysis 3 4 groundwater vulnerability assessment by drastic model morris and foster 2000 defined groundwater pollution risk as the probability that groundwater will become contaminated to an unacceptable level by human activities on the immediately overlying land surface they described groundwater risk assessment as the processes used to predict the possibility of groundwater contamination from pollutants the concept of groundwater vulnerability can be defined as the possibility of percolation and diffusion of contaminants from the ground surface into the groundwater system groundwater vulnerability is usually considered an intrinsic property of a groundwater system depending on its sensitivity to anthropogenic and natural impacts the integrated groundwater vulnerability combines the intrinsic vulnerability with the risk of the groundwater which is generally exposed to the loading of pollutants from certain sources the drastic model was developed by the u s environmental protection agency epa to evaluate groundwater pollution potential for the entire united states as proposed by aller et al 1987 drastic methodology is based on a weighting and rating method that assesses vulnerability by means of seven parameters as follows 1 depth to groundwater table d 2 net recharge r 3 aquifer media a 4 soil media s 5 topography t 6 impact of vadose zone media i 7 hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer c each of the hydrogeological parameters is assigned a rating from 1 to 10 based upon a range of values the ratings are then multiplied by a relative weight ranging from 1 to 5 table 1 the most significant factors have a weight of 5 and the least significant have a weight of 1 the source of data for the seven parameters is shown in table si 1 a field study for groundwater table levels and secondary data was obtained from different sources and formats as shown in table si 1 the layer of the drastic model used as the weighting score was the original scoring from the study of aller et al 1987 except the weighting of net recharge was applied the method of piscopo 2001 weightings of each parameter are shown in table 1 following the preparation of the parameters above the rate and weight of such parameters were interpolated by the inverse distance weighted method idw which estimated cell values by averaging the values of nearby sample data points the theme table of shape file shp was the z value used in spatial interpolation operated with the nearest neighbor using the default power of 2 3 5 groundwater risk assessment risk of groundwater contamination was estimated by combining the groundwater vulnerability of the area with potential pollution load at each location foster and hirata 1988 estimated the risk of groundwater contamination from the interaction between aquifer vulnerability and the surface pollution load the risk of the aquifer was calculated by the arithmetic product of the indexes of the aquifer vulnerability times the pollution load as shown in the following equation gonzalez et al 1997 r l v where r refers to risk value l refers to potential pollution load v refers to groundwater vulnerability the risk values were classified into 4 levels as follows low medium high and very high value and used further to identify the area at risk the cf was used to indicate the degree of environmental contamination abrahim and parker 2008 and evaluate anthropogenic influences of heavy metals in sediments uluturhan 2010 the cf was calculated as the ratio between the sediment metal content at a given station and average shale values of the metal krauskopf 1985 the cf was measured by the following equation hakanson 1980 cf cm cn where cf refers to contamination factor cm refers to concentration of each metal in the soil cn refers to baseline or background value of the specific metal the mobility potential and bioavailability of heavy metals and metalloids in soils was assessed by using a mobility factor mf index calculated on the basis of the following equation nannoni et al 2011 m f f s o l f e x t f s o l f e x t f r e d f o x i f r e s 100 the factor calculated by percentage of solubility fraction plus extractable fraction and divide by the sum of 5 fractions 4 results and discussion physiographically dan chang sub district mostly is flat and can be divided into the high hills of the phu toei national park and the flat plain area see fig 1 the north border area is a hilly terrain whereas the north east and south west areas are separated by mountain and ridge groundwater in the area occurs in the shallow terrain deposit aquifer and in the deeper aquifer the groundwater flows in the north south direction in each sub watershed the topography and groundwater flow indicated the flow passed through the old mine from the north to the southeastern terrain figure si 1 4 1 groundwater levels and hydrogeochemical characteristics the level of shallow wells decreased in the dry season however some wells such as well numbers 5 and 6 were high and flow direction was unchanged figure si 1 and table 2 chemical parameters of groundwater of wet and dry events are shown in table 2 the groundwater ph was slightly acidic and ranged from 5 20 to 5 90 with an average ph of 5 50 and 5 60 for the wet and dry seasons respectively an average electrical conductivity ec was 633 and 638 μs cm for the wet and dry seasons respectively additionally the oxidation potential eh was in the range of 250 370 mv with an average of approximately 313 mv and eh was slightly higher in the dry season 280 mv 390 mv with an average of 327 mv the dissolved oxygen do was in the range of 4 3 4 8 mg l with an average of approximately 4 5 mg l in the wet season and the do tending to decrease in the dry season with an average of approximately 3 3 mg l in the range from 2 1 to 5 8 mg l the concentration of eight major cations and anions na k mg² ca² cl co₃ ² hco₃ and so₄ ² are given in table 3 all ions were plotted as the piper trilinear diagram by grouping the na with k and the co₃ ² with hco₃ the piper trilinear diagram was very useful for classifying the hydrochemical facies of the water samples according to their dominant ions the water type in the area was mainly classified as ca hco₃ water figure si 2 or typical shallow fresh groundwater groundwater with calcium as the dominant cation and bicarbonate as the dominant anion the ca hco₃ water type indicated areas of fresh recharge mondal et al 2011 olobaniyi et al 2007 saxena et al 2003 and might have originated from a co₂ charged rainstorm which produced weak carbonic acid that later dissociated into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions tijani et al 2006 4 2 arsenic in shallow groundwater wells well number 3 was notable for the as concentration both during the dry and wet seasons high as were 14 μg l and 6 μg l for wet and dry respectively the as concentration in the other 6 wells was below the limit of detection in the wet season but tended to be higher in the dry season however these were not over 1 μg l the result showed that the concentrations of as in the dry season were higher than those in the wet season in the study area due to dilution by rainwater since groundwater recharge in the wet season was similar to the study of buragohain et al 2010 the ca hco₃ water type indicated areas of fresh recharge acidic groundwater in this area with the oxidation potential in the range of 270 390 mv leading to as probably in the form of ionized arsenate h₂aso₄ as shown in fig 3 based on as concentrations in the deep wells the highest concentrations of as were found in the southeast study area at well numbers 10 and 11 while the relatively lower and non detectable as were in the north of study area according to the eh ph plot as in groundwater in the deep wells was probably in the ionized arsenate haso₄ ² form which was clearly a different form ionized arsenate h₂aso₄ found in the shallow wells the adsorption of as decreased as the ph increased over the ph 6 9 range saxena et al 2005 usgs 2016 therefore the deep wells with a high ph 7 16 had higher concentrations of as compared to those of shallow wells with average values from 5 5 to 5 6 in dry and wet seasons respectively an average electrical conductivity value was 642 μs cm and ranged from 197 to 798 μs cm furthermore the oxidation potential eh was in the range of 286 423 mv with an average of approximately 356 mv the dissolved oxygen do was in the range of 2 50 3 80 with an average of approximately 3 14 mg l see supplemental material table s1 arsenious acid h₃aso₃ was predominant only at extremely low ph 2 in oxygenated water systems whereas in the range of 2 11 ph as existed in the form of h₂aso₄ and haso₄ ² gong et al 2006 the oxidation of arsenopyrites as shown in eq 1 released a relatively high amount of as in the leachate blowes et al 1998 1 feass s 1 5h₂o 2 75o₂ aq fe² h₃aso₃ aq so₄ ² 4 3 soil sequential extraction the five steps sequential extraction procedure was carried out to define the partitioning of as as follows the water soluble extractable reducible oxidable and residual fractions the statistics for as in the soil of 39 samples is given in table 4 the as distribution in top soils of dan chang is shown in fig 4 and spatial distribution maps of as in each fraction are shown in fig 5 the soil samples of the old mine fell under toxic and alert categories with respect to as since some of the samples exceeded the guideline of pollution control department thailand arsenic in soil did not exceed 3 9 mg kg for habitat and agriculture and did not exceed 27 mg kg for other purposes based on the previous study mandal and suzuki 2002 the as content in soils from thailand was approximately 9 1 6 7 mg kg it also was observed that the groundwater sample well number 3 adjacent to the foothills contained as at a toxic level since the study area was within an alluvial basin the most probable natural sources of as in groundwater might have been a heavy deposition of sediments due to surface erosion from surrounding hills creating aquifers however this area might have undergone long term influences by anthropogenic sources like the old tin mining site average concentrations of total as in soils table 4 exceeded 30 mg kg over the background concentration of as in surface soils 0 15 cm of thailand sukreeyapongse et al 2009 especially soil samples from the old tin mine areas otm which were in the range of 52 12 1070 42 mg kg with an average of 370 82 mg kg the distribution map of as contaminated areas was rasterized by the inverse distance method idw the distribution map of total as shows that as did not distribute evenly fig 5 the high as concentrations were mainly located around the old tin mine area the distribution of the soluble as was mainly in the downstream area with the highest as concentration of 0 43 mg kg in the southern part of the study area at ban sambat charern sampling site number 35 as shown in fig 6 a it was not evenly distributed over the area because many soil sampling points were not detected in the soluble form the distribution of the extractable as as shown in fig 6 b was like that of soluble as the distribution of the extractable as was mainly in the downstream area with the highest as concentration of 1 37 mg kg at ban sambat charern sub district sampling site number 35 an additional cause for high as levels could be due to the use of fertilizers and pesticides in crops in this area such as phosphate fertilizers especially on sugar cane corn cassava and rice davis 1993 donga and eklo 2018 khan et al 2018 the distribution map shows fairly high as concentration at the old tin mine area with the highest concentration of 23 50 mg kg at soil sampling site number 10 for the reducible form as shown in fig 6 c the reducible form is as fixed in fe and or mn oxides such as feaso₄ xh₂o scorodite van herreweghe et al 2003 therefore this form might come from tin mine tailings the distribution map of oxidable as was not evenly distributed as shown in fig 6 d and it was high around the old tin mine area with an average of 32 68 mg kg table 4 the highest value exceeds up to 79 50 mg kg at soil sampling site no 10 where is located not far from of the old tin mine 2 km in the downstream direction indicating that this high as concentration areas were affected from the sediment deposition of contaminated soils or tailings from the old tin mine the distribution of residual as the final fraction of sequential extraction as shown in fig 6 e is similar to the distribution of the oxidisable fraction the 4th fraction and total as see fig 5 because the value of total as content is mainly from the value of residual as according to the study of lee et al 2012 as is primarily bound to the residual phase 95 6 of total as concentration for tungsten mine tailings 4 4 drastic vulnerability map the vulnerability map was based on the drastic index di which was computed as the weighted sum overlay of the seven layers using the following equation aller et al 1987 drastic index di drdw rrrw araw srsw trtw iriw crcw where d depth to water r net recharge a aquifer media s soil media t topography i impact of the vadose zone c hydraulic conductivity 4 4 1 depth to water depth to water refers to the depth to the water surface in an unconfined aquifer deeper water table levels indicate lesser chance to be contaminated by the pollutants rating values for water depths were assigned based upon the assumption that a shallower water table is more chances to be polluted from the ground surface activities the depth of water in the study area varied between 2 03 m mainly located in the central parts for the terrece deposit qt and collovial deposit aquifers qcl to 16 52 m below the ground surface in ordovician ols and granitic aquifers gr located in the west northern and east parts of the study area the rating scores ranged between 3 and 9 where the highest scores were in the west northern part and the lowest scores were in the central discharge area which are presented in table 5 the spatial variation is shown in fig 7 a depth to water table in study area has a high rating in the plain areas between the mountain ranges 4 4 2 recharge recharge indicates the amount of water per unit area of land which penetrates the ground surface and reaches to the groundwater table recharge water is available to transport a contaminant vertically to the groundwater table in essence horizontal with an aquifer since there is no available data of net recharge for the current study area therefore it could be estimated by a sum of slope soil permeability and rainfall according to the method proposed by piscopo 2001 and applied by many studies al rawabdeh et al 2013 kamlesh and shukla 2014 recharge was calculated using the following formula recharge value slope rainfall soil permeability the data of average annual rainfall in suphan buri and kanchanaburi from 9 stations around the study area was obtained from meteorological department thailand the rainfall distributed from northeast to southwest in the range of 830 1070 mm after interpolation of rainfall data parameters and recharge value for the study area was measured using data given in tables 5 and s2 net recharge range and rating is shown in fig 7 b the high rating of net recharge rating score of 10 is in the plain area and the high rating corresponds to a high potential for groundwater pollution 4 4 3 aquifer media aquifer media refers to properties of the saturated zone medium either in consolidated or unconsolidated aquifer which dominates fate and transport of pollutants and is associated with the retention time in groundwater system due to several processes such as sorption dispersion oxidation and biodegradation during the pollutants flowing in the aquifer the larger than grain size medium and more fractures or openings within an aquifer led to higher permeability and lower attenuation capacity hence greater pollution potential the high rating of aquifer media in the study area related to unconsolidated aquifers such as terrace deposits qt and colluvium deposit qcl aquifers which has a rating of 8 while the granitic gr and metamorphic rocks aquifers sdmm has a rating of 4 table 5 the map shown in fig 7 c the central study area demonstrates a great pollution potential 4 4 4 soil media soil media refers to the uppermost weathered portion of the vadose zone characterized by both significant chemical and biological activities the infiltration and leaching potential of pollutants into the groundwater environment is majorly affected by the soil texture including permeability characteristics masipan et al 2016 when soils mainly consist of sand recharge water including pollutants will take a short period of time to reach groundwater rating of soil media in the study area is given in table 5 the highest score rating was loamy sandy soils with a value of 9 and the lowest value of 1 was clay which was found in the complex slope area in general the loamy sand soil mainly consists of sand 70 causing it more porous and permeable in contrast the clay soil is tightly compacted and the pores are not completely connected thus the loamy sandy soils would be more vulnerable than clay soil the soil media map is shown in fig s 3 rate of soil type map shows that the high rate areas were in the vicinity of the stream as shown in fig 7 d and the low rate area related to soil group 62 which had complex slopes in mountain and forest areas 4 4 5 topography topography refers to the slope or steepness of the land surface it helps whether polluted water is moved by runoff or remains on the ground surface long enough to infiltrate after raining the slope index was derived from the digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution areas with steep slope generally generate surface runoff and polluted water and has less potential to release into the groundwater while areas with low slope commonly retain the water body as a pond and polluted water has long enough period of time to reach into the subsurface environment the ratings assigned in the study are presented in table 5 and spatial distributions of slope are presented as fig 7 e the slope values were categorized and rated values in the range of 1 to 10 the study area has a slope of 0 2 the flat area with a high rating of 10 where mostly are located in the plain in the central area while the area with a slope of more than 18 mainly in the northern part of the study area can classify with a minimum rating of 1 4 4 6 impact of the vadose zone impact of the vadose zone is defined as unsaturated zone material above the groundwater level according to the study of aller et al 1987 and other previous studies rahman 2008 senthilkumar and babu 2014 which defined that the impact of the vadose zone depends upon the matrix or types of the soil media the significantly restrictive zone above an aquifer forming the confining layers used in a confined aquifer the type of soil media above the aquifer had the most significant impact since it controls the migration of pollutants before reaching the aquifers according to the drastic ratings the value of impact of vadose zone is shown in table 5 and spatial variations are presented as fig 7 f the characteristics of the material including the rock above the water table are gravel silt clay laterite metamorphic and granite quaternary sediments mainly represent the material in the central plain with a rating of 6 which is more vulnerable than the vadose zone composing of volcanic and metamorphic rocks with a rating of 5 quaternary sediments has a higher rating score because they are unconsolidated media and can be more chemically and biologically weathering thus the pollutants could pass through them easier as compare with volcanic and metamorphic rocks 4 4 7 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity is considered as the ability of an aquifer to transmit water that controls the rate at which groundwater flows under a given hydraulic gradient the hydraulic conductivity ranged between 0 02 and 10 89 m day except ordovician limestone with a wide range value in the study area see figure s4 the ratings based on hydraulic conductivity are shown in table 5 due to the lack of the hydraulic conductivity data in the study area therefore the hydraulic properties were classified based on the aquifer types from the hydrogeological map with the rating values of 1 and 2 the ordovician limestone colluvial deposits and terrace deposits were rated with the value of 2 which is more vulnerable than granite permian carboniferous and silurian devonian metamorphic rock the hydraulic conductivity map and spatial distribution are shown in fig 7 g 4 4 8 drastic vulnerability map in general the possible drastic index ranges from 23 to 226 bonfanti et al 2016 souleymane and zhonghua 2017 the value of the drastic index represents a comparative sensitivity measurement the more drastic index is the more sensitive to groundwater pollution presents in such area in this study area the index score of groundwater vulnerability assessment ranged from 59 to 147 which are reasonable to be divided into 3 zones as follows low index 100 moderate index 100 130 and high index 130 moreover the results of such categories can found that each zone was separated clearly in addition there are many studies which found the range of drastic index is similar to our study most of them divided their areas into 3 zones low medium and high as well babiker et al 2005 ersoy and gültekin 2013 prasad and shukla 2014 rahman 2008 senthilkumar and babu 2014 for example the study of ersoy and gültekin 2013 determined the drastic index ranging from 58 to 177 and classified the vulnerability map into 3 classes low 100 medium 100 140 and high 140 approximately 18 65 of the area showed high vulnerability and about 34 88 showed moderate vulnerability and 46 47 of the area showed low vulnerability the highly vulnerable areas were located along the creek or waterway while the plain area had moderate vulnerability and the mountain area was low in vulnerability fig 8 the spatial distribution of as in shallow groundwaterduring wet and dry seasons had similar distribution patterns fig s5 conversely the result of as in tube wells deep was generally located in the siltstone and sandstone aquifers at the depth of 12 m 62 m there were two wells with high concentrations located at the southeast of study area at well numbers 10 and 11 which were 43 and 27 μg l respectively while the relatively lower and non detected levels were in the north of study area including the abandoned tin mine fig s5 different as concentrations in shallow and deep aquifers of the study area might explain that these two aquifers were a different groundwater system especially at the deep aquifer of the southeast area covered by thick clay as a confining layer 4 5 mobility factor mf and contamination factor cf the 39 soil samples were analyzed for total as and sequential extraction the concentration of total as in soil at the old tin mining area were in the range between 4 80 mg kg to 1070 40 mg kg according to the study by sukreeyapongse et al 2009 after mine closure for 5 years the reported total as in soils was in the range of 8 96 92 35 mg kg the other old tin mine in the south of thailand at ron phibun district nakhon si thammarat province had total as in soil in the range of 2 53 151 mg kg the results of sequential extraction were mostly in the oxidable and residual fractions as shown in fig 9 mobility of heavy metals in soils that dominated their distribution and behavior in soil the mobility of heavy elements in soils became assessed through the use of a mf nannoni et al 2011 defined as the sum of the percentage of solubility fraction fsol and extractable fraction fext divided by the sum of total 5 fractionations the mf of this area was relatively high at the southern part of the study area outside the old mine figure s 6 which separated to other sub watersheds of the old mine as shown as distribution map figure s 6 a the old mine area had very low mf since the fractions had a high ratio of the immobilized form the other fractions of soil extraction such as soluble extractable and reducible were not over the national limited value at 3 9 mg kg soil texture was one of the important factors that could influence as mobility fitz and wenzel 2002 quazi et al 2011 generally clay or fine texture soils had much more surface area than coarse or sandy soils sand quartz was expected to facilitate greater as leaching or loss with runoff thus the soil with high amounts of clay such as clay clay loam and sandy clay loam could adsorb as however some samples with low amounts of clay had high as content sampling site numbers 12 and 16 which were sandy soil at the mine area similarly the study of zulfahmi et al 2012 also analyzed tailing sand by xrd for indicating the presence of arsenopyrite realgar chalcopyrite pyrite hematite and quartz minerals the as from the sequential extraction had different forms proposed by van herreweghe et al 2003 most as in mineral forms were in the reducible oxidable and residual forms which consisted of scorodite feaso₄ xh₂o realgar ass and orpiment as₂s₃ as well as löllingite feas₂ respectively contamination factor cf was used for indicating degree of environmental contamination abrahim and parker 2008 the cf of as contamination in soil samples divided by shale values were 6 6 mg kg as a background value of as the cf of the study area was in the range of 0 73 162 18 with the spatial distribution map shown in fig 9 b cf values were interpreted as suggested by hakanson hakanson 1980 where cf 1 indicated low contamination 1 cf 3 was moderate contamination 3 cf 6 was considerable contamination and cf 6 was very high contamination therefore the values showed that most of the area had very high contamination of as according to hakanson s cf classification according to the classification areas covering the considerable contamination 3 cf 6 and very high contamination cf 6 mainly were located in the old mine area see fig 9 b 4 6 risk assessment map taken from the index of drastic vulnerability a summary of 7 parameters shown in fig 8 the weak zones distributed as spots along the plain area specifically a part of the old tin mine had a drastic score in the range of highly vulnerable moreover as was found in highly vulnerable zones when taking into consideration sampled wells and the vulnerability map to see wells with high concentration of total as the locations and distances of villages adjacent to the old tin mine are shown in the risk maps fig 10 and table 6 to evaluate the risk of pollution the map of the cf of as had to be integrated and overlaid with the vulnerability map indeed the risk map using cf and drastic map shows zones of moderate high and very high risk around the old mine as shown in fig 10 conversely the risk map using mf and drastic map shows high and very high risk in the center of the study area fig 10 a the risk map generated with cf shows a high risk to contaminate in the shallow groundwater since well number 3 was located within a short distance 0 5 km in the downstream direction from the very high risk zone this was consistent with the previous 2010 research on health risk assessment of as contamination in this area done by probabilistic risk assessment pra indicating that 2 sub districts ong phra and wang kun were at risk of cancer due to as exposure 5 conclusions risk of as from contaminated soil to shallow groundwater depends on the vulnerability and potential for as in contaminated soils the old tin mine areas have high vulnerability but the release potential of as is low because as is mostly in oxidable and residual fractions the risk assessment maps were created by overlaying drastic map with either the mf map or cf map although the areas of highly contaminated soil have a low mf the risk map made with the cf shows a higher correlation with as in the shallow groundwater than that of the risk map from mf otherwise total as in contaminated soil influences the shallow aquifer more than the mf from the first two fractions from the sequential extraction the results of this research show the good relationship between the as contamination in shallow groundwater contamination and the cf however the risk map from the mf is also important to indicate the contaminated areas where as is distributed into the other phase such as surface water and plants which might affect health moreover the high vulnerability of the area with high as content in soil will be at risk if the area is continuously re

8482,study region rio verde grande basin brazil study focus extensive regional development mainly expansion of irrigated areas and urban population has resulted in low water availability and caused water conflicts since the 1980s therefore it was necessary to enact the water resources plan of the rio verde grande in 2011 the plan provided actions to improve water availability and meet increased water demand but there have been no studies on the sustainability of these policies it was evaluated the future of the water management and calculate the sustainability index for water resources in the rio verde grande basin rvgb brazil new hydrological insights for the region the water demand and available water have been compared and evaluated for activities in the water resources plan wrp based on three different improvement of available water scenarios these scenarios include water imports and the construction of channels and reservoirs a sustainability index was used to evaluate and compare alternative plans for future water availability and water supply in these scenarios considering measures of reliability resilience vulnerability and maximum deficit the si has identified the best scenario foreseen in the wrp for the rvgb that will improve the availability of water through 2030 having positive impact to water users of the basin the results also indicate that the increase in available water will not result in significant improvements of sustainability of water resources by the implementation of the policies proposed in the wrp for the rvgb keywords hydrologic model integrated water resources management rio verde grande water management weap model 1 introduction the rio verde grande basin rvgb provides significant agricultural production for important cities such as montes claros 400 000 inhabitants primary through irrigation extensive regional development and urban expansion have caused low water availability in regional rivers causing water conflicts that have been recorded since the 1980s rvgb presents several problems of water resources as a high variability in time and space of water resources many years of the drought activities that demand a lot of water as irrigation with 90 of water consuption and there is almost no infrastructure for water resources to solve these problems in 2011 the water resources plan for the verde grande river basin wrp was approved which aimed to articulate the instruments of the national water resources policy and propose a series of actions to improve available water in the basin ana 2016a b in the water resources plan of the rio verde grande three scenarios were envisaged for implementing action interventions that were already underway to increase water supply were considered in the trend scenario based on the trend scenario two other scenarios were developed normative 1 and 2 in which water management leads to successive efficiencies that both increase available water and efficiency of use however there have been no studies in the rvgb that evaluate and compare the sustainability of different actions or methods for water management in these scenarios proposed on wrp recently other countries have placed great emphasis on the adaptability of water resources using measures that reduce the vulnerability of these systems in proposed future scenarios cerón et al 2011 sandoval solis et al 2011 cerón et al 2012 cortés et al 2012 koop and van leeuwen 2015 loucks and van beek 2005 the vulnerability is the magnitude of an adverse impact on a system the objective is to seek ways to reduce the negative impacts of actual and expected events and meet the water requirements for various human activities and the environment considering various future scenarios to achieve this target performance measures or indices are required that can be used to evaluate and compare water resources subject to varying actions and policies under different scenarios sandoval solis et al 2011 the sustainability index si identifies policies that preserve or improve the desired water management characteristics of the basin in the future thus si of water resources is an index that provides a mechanism for evaluating and comparing different methods of management and water uses with regard to sustainability if proposed policy or action of the water plan make the system more sustainable the si will show that the system will have a larger adaptive capacity thus given the increasing conflicts between water users in the rvgb the can si be applied to assess the various actions proposed in the wrp with regard to the various sectoral demands and future scenarios proposed in the wrp could si to be used to evaluate and compare policies proposed in water plan of others basin in the region si used in this study was developed by loucks 1997 adapted by sandoval solis et al 2011 and recently extended by srdjevic and srdjevic 2017 the objective of this work is to calculate the si of water resources in the rio verde grande basin brazil evaluating and comparing water demand and available water for activities foreseen in the wrp for three water availability future scenarios 2 methodology 2 1 study area and model geography the rio verde grande is a major tributary to the east side of são francisco river and forms the boundary between the states of bahia and minas gerais along part of its course the rio verde grande basin has an area of 31 410 km² covering eight municipalities in bahia 13 of the total area and 27 municipalities in minas gerais 87 of the total area the population was 768 000 inhabitants as of 2011 which corresponds to about 5 of the total population of the são francisco river basin ana 2016a b the headwaters of the rio verde grande are at an elevation of 1256 m in minas gerais and travels 577 km to join the são francisco river at an elevation of 431 m the segmentation of the rio verde grande basin rvgb into smaller subcatchments was proposed in the wrp for the basin the intention was to obtain a spatial structure of the basin to analyze information from diagnosis to future scenarios phase the eight rvgb subcatchments are defined as follows alto verde grande avg this region contains the highest elevations of the rvgb and has a watershed area of 3098 km² the avg sub basin contains about 48 of the population and most of the industries in the rvgb medio verde grande trecho alto mvg ta this region is located downstream of the avg and has a watershed area of 7102 km² it contains most of the cattle operations in the rvgb médio verde grande trecho baixo mvg tb this region contains the verde grande river from the end of the mvg ta and goes to mouth of verde pequeno river the area is 3161 km² alto gorutuba ag the largest reservoir in the rvgb is in ag sub basin the area is 2133 km² médio baixo gorutuba mbg this region is the largest subcatchment of the rvgb at 7715 km² it has the second largest population of the entire basin alto verde pequeno avp the area is 2899 km² baixo verde pequeno bvp the area is 3368 km² baixo verde grande bvg this region is the smallest sub basin of the rvgb at 1934 km² it has the smallest population of the entire basin but has the largest irrigated area more than 21 000 ha is irrigated that sub basin stretches from the confluence of verde pequeno and verde grande rivers to the confluence with the são francisco river in the upper rvgb the prevailing climate is semi humid and warm with mean annual rainfall around 1100 mm occurring mostly between november and february summer the mean annual rainfall in the lower basin is around 700 mm the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is around 2000 mm considering whole basin ana 2016a b 2 2 model description a model for the rvgb was built using the water evaluation and planning system weap an integrated water resource management iwrm model developed by the stockholm environment institute yates et al 2005a the soil moisture method in weap was used to model the hydrologic response of the basin this method is based on empirical functions that describe the behavior of surface runoff interflow baseflow evapotranspiration and deep percolation for a basin yates et al 2005a b as in the wrp for the rvgb ana 2016a b the rio verde grande basin was subdivided into eight sub catchments with the same water users and connected to a network of rivers see fig 1 the water user withdraws this resource from various water sources e g rivers groundwater and reservoirs and for its demands the water users were divided into the four largest groups irrigation livestock urban population and rural population the rvgb map fig 1 includes the upper and lower catchment and schematic diagram that shows six control points cp and all catchments contributing to the rio verde grande 2 3 data source monthly data for precipitation surface air temperature relative humidity and wind velocity were obtained from the instituto nacional de meteorologia inmet 2015 for 2000 2014 the historic climate conditions were repeated from 2015 to 2030 because this period of record includes drought and wet years necessary to evaluate the different strategies proposed in the wrp monthly streamflow data were obtained from hidroweb ana 2016a b at six control points ce capitão enéias cj colônia do jaíba and boca boca da caatinga on the verde grande

and a baseline scenario table 1 baseline scenario no action taken trend scenario interventions that were already underway to increase water supply the scenario proposes importing water from the congonhas river to the avg at 2 m³ s starting in 2018 normative 1 scenario the water management increases water supply using the same intervention as in the trend scenario plus two additional water diversions the first is from the são francisco river to the city of jaiba 1 5 m³ s to the mvg tb starting in 2020 the second is from the são francisco river to the city of verdelandia an additional 1 5 m³ s to the mvg tb starting in 2025 normative 2 the water management increases water supply using the normative 1 plan with an additional water diversion from the são francisco river 1 5 m³ s to the ag and resulting in a total of 4 5 m³ s diverted starting in 2028 and construction of five dams two in the avg one in the mbg and two in the avp these scenarios are developed for the period from 2015 to 2030 2 5 performance criteria and sustainability index four performance criteria were used to evaluate the model results and compare alternative management policies under the three scenarios for increasing available water in the rvgb wrp ana 2016a b volumetric reliability resilience vulnerability and maximum deficit these performance criteria quantify the si of the water resources system in the rvgb all performance criteria are based on a water supplied deficit d t i eq 1 which is the difference between water demand x t a r g e t t i and water supplied x s u p p l i e d t i for each time

calibrated and validated using monthly flows from the six control points gauging stations in the basin and monthly climate data based on precipitation temperature relative humidity and wind speed the flow data for the period 2000 2009 was used for calibration and 2010 2014 for validation fig 2 the calibration parameters were deep water capacity dwc varying from 15 to 3000 mm runoff resistance factor rrf from 1 to 10 preferred flow direction pfd from 0 1 to 1 root zone conductivity rzc from 5 to 30 and soil water capacity swc varying from 100 to 3000 mm the trial and error approach that was applied in this research involved a process wherein the model parameters were altered systematically and then the model was ran several times until the solution matched observed values within an acceptable level of accuracy the coefficient of efficiency nash sutclifffe nse and index of agreement willmott ia eq 9 and 10 were calculated to evaluate the performance of the weap model nash and sutcliffe 1970 legates and mccabe 1999 coffey et al 2004 gupta and kling 2011 ewen 2011 bren and lane 2014 the model calibration was accomplished manually using trial and error and maximizing nse and ia parameters such as soil water capacity swc root zone conductivity rzc runoff resistance factor rrf and preferred flow direction pfd were adjusted so that the predicted flow from weap fit the observed flow table 2 shows a summary of the nse ia and r2 values for the calibration and validation period for each control point relationships between monthly observed and predicted streamflows show a strong correlation indicating good model performance which is supported by an nse above 0 69 and ia above 0 92 the validation period showed a decreasing performance however with an nse and ia above 0 7 and 0 8 respectively the alternating between the nse values for the calibration and validation period can be explained by many gaps in the streamflow data provided in the calibration period for some gauging stations in the validation period the gauging stations used in this work presented data more consistent with smaller number of failures some gauging stations in ag mbg and bvp in this work were used the monthly average due to the large number of failures drought periods also influenced the variation of nse in the calibration and validation periods for some control points fig 2 shows the streamflow time series data of observed and predicted flows for control point boca da caatinga at the outlet of the basin similar goodness of fit results were obtained for the rest of the control points the model didn t reproduce well the flows for season period of some control points 9 s e 1 0 i 1 n q i o q i p 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 10 i a 1 0 i 1 n q i o q i p 2 i 1 n q i p q o q i o q o 2 3 results and discussions the rio verde grande is a water stressed basin in the northern part of the state of minas gerais brazil the high water demand from many water users has resulted in low water availability in regional rivers and caused water conflicts since the 1980s therefore an evaluation and comparison using the si is required for the various actions proposed in wrp for the rvgb to address this need the various sectoral demands and future scenarios proposed in the plan are evaluated using the weap model 3 1 analyses of the performance criteria for basin water resources although the rvgb was segmented into eight subcatchments only avg mvg tb and bvg along the main stream of the basin are shown as examples in this work because avg represents almost 50 of the water demand for the urban population of the whole basin mvg tb will receive the largest available water intervention with 3 m³ s and the bvg represents the highest water demand for irrigated areas throughout rvgb table 3 and figs 3 5 show the performance criteria reliability resilience vulnerability and maximum deficient for irrigation area livestock and urban and rural population in those subcatchments in avg both livestock and rural population showed high resilience and reliability and zero vulnerability and max deficit this result is due to the current low activity of water users and even an increase proposed in the wrp of rvgb ana 2016a b does not compromise the future availability of water in this subcatchment in avg urban population is the largest consumer of water surpassing irrigation area urban population shows a significant improvement in resilience and reliability only in the trend scenario when the water supply to the basin increases by 2 m³ s from the congonhas dam in addition neither of the normative 1 and normative 2 scenarios results in improvements in the performance criteria for reliability and shows only a small change in resilience the vulnerability is halved but remains stable in the trend scenario similarly of the study of safavi et al 2015 that after assessing some interventions found very low reliability and resilience and high vulnerability of the zayandehrud dam located at center of iran in very critical conditions period after withdrawing of water to irrigation industries animal farming and municipal supply the maximum deficit remains high for all scenarios despite the increase in water supply proposed in the wrp the irrigation area in the avg is the smallest in the entire basin and shows small improvements in all the criteria analyzed but has high vulnerability values and maximum deficit in the mvg tb basin high reliability and resilience values are found for livestock and available water for rural and urban populations because the mvg tb has a low population density the water demand also remains low however irrigation area is low in all performance criteria reliability and resilience do not exceed the thresholds of 66 1 and 22 5 respectively fig 4 the vulnerability and maximum deficit have values of 42 3 and 77 1 respectively those values are considered high even though the mvg tb basin receives two thirds of the water diversion from the são francisco river 3 0 m³ s if the irrigation area growth rate remains as proposed in the wrp it will be a high risk activity there is no urban population in the bvg because the municipalities are located outside the boundaries of the subcatchment therefore this water user does not appear in fig 5 the bvg has the largest irrigated area in the entire basin so the irrigation area also shows relatively high reliability values but low resilience values for all scenarios proposed in the water plan once all proposals for water development in the basin are implemented the vulnerability falls from 63 5 to 49 3 and the max deficit remains above 80 3 2 sustainability index and sustainability by group for basin water resources because the rvgb has high water demand and low water availability it is challenging to identify actions that can improve the management of its water resources when evaluating performance criteria in isolation lèvite et al 2003 testing water demand management scenarios in water stressed basin in south africa demonstrated that even in normal hydrological years but no water demand management efforts just 10 of the water reserve targets could all be achieved the si and sg are tools that can evaluate and compare actions to improve the management of water resources in a basin by integrating multiple performance criteria table 4 and figs 6 8 show the variations in the si for a subcatchment with reference to the baseline scenario in which no action had been implemented fig 6 shows a comparison of the baseline with the trend scenario whose only structural action was to increase water available by importing water from the congonhas river to the juramento dam to meet the demands of urban population growth in the avg specifically montes claros city this action has a significantly positive impact resulting in a si 30 subcatchments in the same watercourse mvg ta mvg tb and bvg showed changes in their si of 1 9 2 4 and 2 2 respectively the slight increase in si for the subcatchments is due to 50 of the imported water being allocated for environmental flow however these increases in si are not enough to change the classification range 10 as shown in fig 6 fig 7 shows the comparison between the baseline and normative 1 scenarios as indicated previously the normative 1 scenario has the same criteria as the trend scenario with the addition of water diversions of 1 5 m³ s to jaíba and 1 5 m³ s to verdelândia from these additional diversions there is a significant improvement in the si throughout the main channel of the rio verde grande all subcatchments located in the main river channel showed meaningful changes in the si classification 35 3 7 3 9 6 and 13 1 for the avg mvg ta mvg tb and bvg respectively fig 8 shows the comparison between the baseline and normative 2 scenarios as indicated previously the normative 2 scenario has the same criteria as the normative 1 scenario with the addition of construction of five dams and an increase in flow around 0 71 m³ s table 1 two dams are added to the avg with a flow increase of around 0 04 m³ s one dam is added to the ag with a flow increase of around 0 05 m³ s and two dams are added to the avp in addition the normative 2 scenario provides for the establishment of another water diversion from the são francisco river reaching the bico da pedra dam in nova porteirinha city with a flow of 1 5 m³ s these actions result in an improvement to the sis for almost the entire rvgb except for the avp and bvp these two subcatchments have two proposed dams the santo domingo dam with a regulated flow of 0 42 m³ s and the mamonas dam with a flow rate of 0 05 m³ s despite the increase in water availability in both subcatchments the demand will grow outweighing supply which leads to very low sustainability these low si values for avp and bvp can be modified based on the implementation date for the actions proposed in those subcatchments the sg was calculated to analyze the activities by sustainability of each activity and assess the improvement due to the proposed in the wrp fig 9 comparing the four water users analyzed in this work the livestock has the highest sg above 90 followed by rural population approximately 80 however the available water to the basin through importing water water diversions and reservoirs results in a small increase in the sg for irrigation compared with the reference scenario baseline this result shows that irrigated area growth will result a water demand always below available water assuming the growth rate proposed in the wrp is maintained therefore irrigated area has low sustainability the water activity for urban population shows a considerable increase in sg because the trend scenario results in a large import of water supply from the congonhas river with a flow of 2 m³ s this action results in more than 30 increase in sg but the other actions do not result in significant improvements to sg thus urban population reaches a plateau at approximately 60 sg fig 9 whereas water supply for population is the top priority provided for in the wrp this activity still has a high vulnerability value as shown in fig 10 all scenarios compared to the baseline scenario provide an improvement in the si however the si remains at low levels throughout the basin after the implementation of the policies the si in the rvgb only increased 7 7 which is little considering the increasing water demand from growth proposed by the rvgb 4 summary and conclusions the increasing economic activity and growing population of the rvgb resulted in conflicts over the use of water that led in the elaboration of a water resources plan several actions of improvements in the available water were proposed in the plan however without an evaluation if these actions would result in the sustainability of the water resources thus the si was used to evaluate and compare the increasing demand for water and the improvement of the available water available with the implementation of several actions proposed in the basin water plan the si has identified the best scenario foreseen in the wrp for the rvgb that will improve the availability of water through 2030 having positive impact to water users of the basin however the water availability has improved for some activities in the proposed scenarios but the water resources remains unsustainable and has a high maximum deficit in all subcatchments the comparison of the sg between different water users indicated that the actions proposed in the rvgb significantly improved the water supply for urban population in the avg subcatchment considering the entire rvgb there were no significant improvements in sustainability of water resources with the implementation of the policies proposed in wrp even considering the best scenario the si has a limitation when the water required by the system is not well calculated especially when it comes to estimating future scenarios the quality of data in terms of availability and reliability also is very important and must be dealt with common sense even thus si is a tool that can be used by decision makers and stakeholders in the water resource management process to evaluate and compare proposed actions in a basin water plan avoiding unnecessary financial resources expenditures in actions that will not result in

8482,study region rio verde grande basin brazil study focus extensive regional development mainly expansion of irrigated areas and urban population has resulted in low water availability and caused water conflicts since the 1980s therefore it was necessary to enact the water resources plan of the rio verde grande in 2011 the plan provided actions to improve water availability and meet increased water demand but there have been no studies on the sustainability of these policies it was evaluated the future of the water management and calculate the sustainability index for water resources in the rio verde grande basin rvgb brazil new hydrological insights for the region the water demand and available water have been compared and evaluated for activities in the water resources plan wrp based on three different improvement of available water scenarios these scenarios include water imports and the construction of channels and reservoirs a sustainability index was used to evaluate and compare alternative plans for future water availability and water supply in these scenarios considering measures of reliability resilience vulnerability and maximum deficit the si has identified the best scenario foreseen in the wrp for the rvgb that will improve the availability of water through 2030 having positive impact to water users of the basin the results also indicate that the increase in available water will not result in significant improvements of sustainability of water resources by the implementation of the policies proposed in the wrp for the rvgb keywords hydrologic model integrated water resources management rio verde grande water management weap model 1 introduction the rio verde grande basin rvgb provides significant agricultural production for important cities such as montes claros 400 000 inhabitants primary through irrigation extensive regional development and urban expansion have caused low water availability in regional rivers causing water conflicts that have been recorded since the 1980s rvgb presents several problems of water resources as a high variability in time and space of water resources many years of the drought activities that demand a lot of water as irrigation with 90 of water consuption and there is almost no infrastructure for water resources to solve these problems in 2011 the water resources plan for the verde grande river basin wrp was approved which aimed to articulate the instruments of the national water resources policy and propose a series of actions to improve available water in the basin ana 2016a b in the water resources plan of the rio verde grande three scenarios were envisaged for implementing action interventions that were already underway to increase water supply were considered in the trend scenario based on the trend scenario two other scenarios were developed normative 1 and 2 in which water management leads to successive efficiencies that both increase available water and efficiency of use however there have been no studies in the rvgb that evaluate and compare the sustainability of different actions or methods for water management in these scenarios proposed on wrp recently other countries have placed great emphasis on the adaptability of water resources using measures that reduce the vulnerability of these systems in proposed future scenarios cerón et al 2011 sandoval solis et al 2011 cerón et al 2012 cortés et al 2012 koop and van leeuwen 2015 loucks and van beek 2005 the vulnerability is the magnitude of an adverse impact on a system the objective is to seek ways to reduce the negative impacts of actual and expected events and meet the water requirements for various human activities and the environment considering various future scenarios to achieve this target performance measures or indices are required that can be used to evaluate and compare water resources subject to varying actions and policies under different scenarios sandoval solis et al 2011 the sustainability index si identifies policies that preserve or improve the desired water management characteristics of the basin in the future thus si of water resources is an index that provides a mechanism for evaluating and comparing different methods of management and water uses with regard to sustainability if proposed policy or action of the water plan make the system more sustainable the si will show that the system will have a larger adaptive capacity thus given the increasing conflicts between water users in the rvgb the can si be applied to assess the various actions proposed in the wrp with regard to the various sectoral demands and future scenarios proposed in the wrp could si to be used to evaluate and compare policies proposed in water plan of others basin in the region si used in this study was developed by loucks 1997 adapted by sandoval solis et al 2011 and recently extended by srdjevic and srdjevic 2017 the objective of this work is to calculate the si of water resources in the rio verde grande basin brazil evaluating and comparing water demand and available water for activities foreseen in the wrp for three water availability future scenarios 2 methodology 2 1 study area and model geography the rio verde grande is a major tributary to the east side of são francisco river and forms the boundary between the states of bahia and minas gerais along part of its course the rio verde grande basin has an area of 31 410 km² covering eight municipalities in bahia 13 of the total area and 27 municipalities in minas gerais 87 of the total area the population was 768 000 inhabitants as of 2011 which corresponds to about 5 of the total population of the são francisco river basin ana 2016a b the headwaters of the rio verde grande are at an elevation of 1256 m in minas gerais and travels 577 km to join the são francisco river at an elevation of 431 m the segmentation of the rio verde grande basin rvgb into smaller subcatchments was proposed in the wrp for the basin the intention was to obtain a spatial structure of the basin to analyze information from diagnosis to future scenarios phase the eight rvgb subcatchments are defined as follows alto verde grande avg this region contains the highest elevations of the rvgb and has a watershed area of 3098 km² the avg sub basin contains about 48 of the population and most of the industries in the rvgb medio verde grande trecho alto mvg ta this region is located downstream of the avg and has a watershed area of 7102 km² it contains most of the cattle operations in the rvgb médio verde grande trecho baixo mvg tb this region contains the verde grande river from the end of the mvg ta and goes to mouth of verde pequeno river the area is 3161 km² alto gorutuba ag the largest reservoir in the rvgb is in ag sub basin the area is 2133 km² médio baixo gorutuba mbg this region is the largest subcatchment of the rvgb at 7715 km² it has the second largest population of the entire basin alto verde pequeno avp the area is 2899 km² baixo verde pequeno bvp the area is 3368 km² baixo verde grande bvg this region is the smallest sub basin of the rvgb at 1934 km² it has the smallest population of the entire basin but has the largest irrigated area more than 21 000 ha is irrigated that sub basin stretches from the confluence of verde pequeno and verde grande rivers to the confluence with the são francisco river in the upper rvgb the prevailing climate is semi humid and warm with mean annual rainfall around 1100 mm occurring mostly between november and february summer the mean annual rainfall in the lower basin is around 700 mm the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is around 2000 mm considering whole basin ana 2016a b 2 2 model description a model for the rvgb was built using the water evaluation and planning system weap an integrated water resource management iwrm model developed by the stockholm environment institute yates et al 2005a the soil moisture method in weap was used to model the hydrologic response of the basin this method is based on empirical functions that describe the behavior of surface runoff interflow baseflow evapotranspiration and deep percolation for a basin yates et al 2005a b as in the wrp for the rvgb ana 2016a b the rio verde grande basin was subdivided into eight sub catchments with the same water users and connected to a network of rivers see fig 1 the water user withdraws this resource from various water sources e g rivers groundwater and reservoirs and for its demands the water users were divided into the four largest groups

contributing to the rio verde grande 2 3 data source monthly data for precipitation surface air temperature relative humidity and wind velocity were obtained from the instituto nacional de meteorologia inmet 2015 for 2000 2014 the historic climate conditions were repeated from 2015 to 2030 because this period of record includes drought and wet years necessary to evaluate the different strategies proposed in the wrp monthly streamflow data were obtained from hidroweb ana 2016a b at six control points ce capitão enéias cj colônia do jaíba and boca boca da caatinga on the verde grande

and a baseline scenario table 1 baseline scenario no action taken trend scenario interventions that were already underway to increase water supply the scenario proposes importing water from the congonhas river to the avg at 2 m³ s starting in 2018 normative 1 scenario the water management increases water supply using the same intervention as in the trend scenario plus two additional water diversions the first is from the são francisco river to the city of jaiba 1 5 m³ s to the mvg tb starting in 2020 the second is from the são francisco river to the city of verdelandia an additional 1 5 m³ s to the mvg tb starting in 2025 normative 2 the water management increases water supply using the normative 1 plan with an additional water diversion from the são francisco river 1 5 m³ s to the ag and resulting in a total of 4 5 m³ s diverted starting in 2028 and construction of five dams two in the avg one in the mbg and two in the avp these scenarios are developed for the period from 2015 to 2030 2 5 performance criteria and sustainability index four performance criteria were used to evaluate the model results and compare alternative management policies under the three scenarios for increasing available water in the rvgb wrp ana 2016a b volumetric reliability resilience vulnerability and maximum deficit these performance criteria quantify the si of the water resources system in

calibrated and validated using monthly flows from the six control points gauging stations in the basin and monthly climate data based on precipitation temperature relative humidity and wind speed the flow data for the period 2000 2009 was used for calibration and 2010 2014 for validation fig 2 the calibration parameters were deep water capacity dwc varying from 15 to 3000 mm runoff resistance factor rrf from 1 to 10 preferred flow direction pfd from 0 1 to 1 root zone conductivity rzc from 5 to 30 and soil water capacity swc varying from 100 to 3000 mm the trial and error approach that was applied in this research involved a process wherein the model parameters were altered systematically and then the model was ran several times until the solution matched observed values within an acceptable level of accuracy the coefficient of efficiency nash sutclifffe nse and index of agreement willmott ia eq 9 and 10 were calculated to evaluate the performance of the weap model nash and sutcliffe 1970 legates and mccabe 1999 coffey et al 2004 gupta and kling 2011 ewen 2011 bren and lane 2014 the model calibration was accomplished manually using trial and error and maximizing nse and ia parameters such as soil water capacity swc root zone conductivity rzc runoff resistance factor rrf and preferred flow direction pfd were adjusted so that the predicted flow from weap fit the observed flow table 2 shows a summary of the nse ia and r2 values for the calibration and validation period for each control point relationships between monthly observed and predicted streamflows show a strong correlation indicating good model performance which is supported by an nse above 0 69 and ia above 0 92 the validation period showed a decreasing performance however with an nse and ia above 0 7 and 0 8 respectively the alternating between the nse values for the calibration and validation period can be explained by many gaps in the streamflow data provided in the calibration period for some gauging stations in the validation period the gauging stations used in this work presented data more consistent with smaller number of failures some gauging stations in ag mbg and bvp in this work were used the monthly average due to the large number of failures drought periods also influenced the variation of nse in the calibration and validation periods for some control points fig 2 shows the streamflow time series data of observed and predicted flows for control point boca da caatinga at the outlet of the basin similar goodness of fit results were obtained for the rest of the control points the model didn t reproduce well the flows for season period of some control points 9 s e 1 0 i 1 n q i o q i p 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 10 i a 1 0 i 1 n q i o q i p 2 i 1 n q i p q o q i o q o 2 3 results and discussions the rio verde grande is a water stressed basin in the northern part of the state of minas gerais brazil the high water demand from many water users has resulted in low water availability in regional rivers and caused water conflicts since the 1980s therefore an evaluation and comparison using the si is required for the various actions proposed in wrp for the rvgb to address this need the various sectoral demands and future scenarios proposed in the plan are evaluated using the weap model 3 1 analyses of the performance criteria for basin water resources although the rvgb was segmented into eight subcatchments only avg mvg tb and bvg along the main stream of the basin are shown as examples in this work because avg represents almost 50 of the water demand for the urban population of the whole basin mvg tb will receive the largest available water intervention with 3 m³ s and the bvg represents the highest water demand for irrigated areas throughout rvgb table 3 and figs 3 5 show the performance criteria reliability resilience vulnerability and maximum deficient for irrigation area livestock and urban and rural population in those subcatchments in avg both livestock and rural population showed high resilience and reliability and zero vulnerability and max deficit this result is due to the current low activity of water users and even an increase proposed in the wrp of rvgb ana 2016a b does not compromise the future availability of water in this subcatchment in avg urban population is the largest consumer of water surpassing irrigation area urban population shows a significant improvement in resilience and reliability only in the trend scenario when the water supply to the basin increases by 2 m³ s from the congonhas dam in addition neither of the normative 1 and normative 2 scenarios results in improvements in the performance criteria for reliability and shows only a small change in resilience the vulnerability is halved but remains stable in the trend scenario similarly of the study of safavi et al 2015 that after assessing some interventions found very low reliability and resilience and high vulnerability of the zayandehrud dam located at center of iran in very critical conditions period after withdrawing of water to irrigation industries animal farming and municipal supply the maximum deficit remains high for all scenarios despite the increase in water supply proposed in the wrp the irrigation area in the avg is the smallest in the entire basin and shows small improvements in all the criteria analyzed but has high vulnerability values and maximum deficit in the mvg tb basin high reliability and resilience values are found for livestock and available water for rural and urban populations because the mvg tb has a low population density the water demand also remains low however irrigation area is low in all performance criteria reliability and resilience do not exceed the thresholds of 66 1 and 22 5 respectively fig 4 the vulnerability and maximum deficit have values of 42 3 and 77 1 respectively those values are considered high even though the mvg tb basin receives two thirds of the water diversion from the são francisco river 3 0 m³ s if the irrigation area growth rate remains as proposed in the wrp it will be a high risk activity there is no urban population in the bvg because the municipalities are located outside the boundaries of the subcatchment therefore this water user does not appear in fig 5 the bvg has the largest irrigated area in the entire basin so the irrigation area also shows relatively high reliability values but low resilience values for all scenarios proposed in the water plan once all proposals for water development in the basin are implemented the vulnerability falls from 63 5 to 49 3 and the max deficit remains above 80 3 2 sustainability index and sustainability by group for basin water resources because the rvgb has high water demand and low water availability it is challenging to identify actions that can improve the management of its water resources when evaluating performance criteria in isolation lèvite et al 2003 testing water demand management scenarios in water stressed basin in south africa demonstrated that even in normal hydrological years but no water demand management efforts just 10 of the water reserve targets could all be achieved the si and sg are tools that can evaluate and compare actions to improve the management of water resources in a basin by integrating multiple performance criteria table 4 and figs 6 8 show the variations in the si for a subcatchment with reference to the baseline scenario in which no action had been implemented fig 6 shows a comparison of the baseline with the trend scenario whose only structural action was to increase water available by importing water from the congonhas river to the juramento dam to meet the demands of urban population growth in the avg specifically montes claros city this action has a significantly positive impact resulting in a si 30 subcatchments in the same watercourse mvg ta mvg tb and bvg showed changes in their si of 1 9 2 4 and 2 2 respectively the slight increase in si for the subcatchments is due to 50 of the imported water being allocated for environmental flow however these increases in si are not enough to change the classification range 10 as shown in fig 6 fig 7 shows the comparison between the baseline and normative 1 scenarios as indicated previously the normative 1 scenario has the same criteria as the trend scenario with the addition of water diversions of 1 5 m³ s to jaíba and 1 5 m³ s to verdelândia from these additional diversions there is a significant improvement in the si throughout the main channel of the rio verde grande all subcatchments located in the main river channel showed meaningful changes in the si classification 35 3 7 3 9 6 and 13 1 for the avg mvg ta mvg tb and bvg respectively fig 8 shows the comparison between the baseline and normative 2 scenarios as indicated previously the normative 2 scenario has the same criteria as the normative 1 scenario with the addition of construction of five dams and an increase in flow around 0 71 m³ s table 1 two dams are added to the avg with a flow increase of around 0 04 m³ s one dam is added to the ag with a flow increase of around 0 05 m³ s and two dams are added to the avp in addition the normative 2 scenario provides for the establishment of another water diversion from the são francisco river reaching the bico da pedra dam in nova porteirinha city with a flow of 1 5 m³ s these actions result in an improvement to the sis for almost the entire rvgb except for the avp and bvp these two subcatchments have two proposed dams the santo domingo dam with a regulated flow of 0 42 m³ s and the mamonas dam with a flow rate of 0 05 m³ s despite the increase in water availability in both subcatchments the demand will grow outweighing supply which leads to very low sustainability these low si values for avp and bvp can be modified based on the implementation date for the actions proposed in those subcatchments the sg was calculated to analyze the activities by sustainability of each activity and assess the improvement due to the proposed in the wrp fig 9 comparing the four water users analyzed in this work the livestock has the highest sg above 90 followed by rural population approximately 80 however the available water to the basin through importing water water diversions and reservoirs results in a small increase in the sg for irrigation compared with the reference scenario baseline this result shows that irrigated area growth will result a water demand always below available water assuming the growth rate proposed in the wrp is maintained therefore irrigated area has low sustainability the water activity for urban population shows a considerable increase in sg because the trend scenario results in a large import of water supply from the congonhas river with a flow of 2 m³ s this action results in more than 30 increase in sg but the other actions do not result in significant improvements to sg thus urban population reaches a plateau at approximately 60 sg fig 9 whereas water supply for population is the top priority provided for in the wrp this activity still has a high vulnerability value as shown in fig 10 all scenarios compared to the baseline scenario provide an improvement in the si however the si remains at low levels throughout the basin after the implementation of the policies the si in the rvgb only increased 7 7 which is little considering the increasing water demand from growth proposed by the rvgb 4 summary and conclusions the increasing economic activity and growing population of the rvgb resulted in conflicts over the use of water that led in the elaboration of a water resources plan several actions of improvements in the available water were proposed in the plan however without an evaluation if these actions would result in the sustainability of the water resources thus the si was used to evaluate and compare the increasing demand for water and the improvement of the available water available with the implementation of several actions proposed in the basin water plan the si has identified the best scenario foreseen in the wrp for the rvgb that will improve the availability of water through 2030 having positive impact to water users of the basin however the water availability has improved for some activities in the proposed scenarios but the water resources remains unsustainable and has a high maximum deficit in all subcatchments the comparison of the sg between different water users indicated that the actions proposed in the rvgb significantly improved the water supply for urban population in the avg subcatchment considering the entire rvgb there were no significant improvements in sustainability of water resources with the implementation of the policies proposed in wrp even considering the best scenario the si has a limitation when the water required by the system is not well calculated especially when it comes to estimating future scenarios the quality of data in terms of availability and reliability also is very important and must be dealt with common sense even thus si is a tool that can be used by decision makers and stakeholders in the water resource management process to evaluate and compare proposed actions in a basin water plan avoiding unnecessary financial resources expenditures in actions that will not result in significant improvements in the available water for water users environmental and system requirements acknowledgments this work was supported by funds from the conselho nacional de desenvolvimento

8483,study region upper missouri river basin study focus the semi arid upper missouri river basin umrb has experienced notable volatility in high and low streamflow extremes in recent decades punctuated by the record 2011 flood this study provides a new perspective into the relative importance of precipitation and antecedent moisture conditions in driving extreme streamflow ensemble streamflow simulations demonstrate that precipitation is largely the dominant driver for high streamflows applying the observed atmospheric forcing in 2011 with initial conditions of antecedent hydrologic conditions from 64 historic years consistently produces large streamflow events exceeding the 85th percentile of historical peak flows this study attributes the individual roles of atmospheric conditions and antecedent soil moisture on extreme streamflow production it uses a novel modeling framework that provides a greater understanding for the role that heterogeneity in basin scale hydrologic features have in extreme streamflow generation new hydrologic insights for the region a detailed analysis of the record 2011 flood event shows that streamflow generated over the region s easternmost sub basin is acutely sensitive to antecedent moisture yet the 2011 record streamflow cannot be explained by a single factor or as the result of long term trends with the basin responding to several independent factors significantly high p 0 05 antecedent moisture and significant cold season precipitation perhaps most importantly was the record setting may precipitation which limited the ability of ensemble streamflow simulations initialized on 1 march from reliably predicting the record june streamflows the recent volatility of umrb streamflow may be a harbinger of future decades based on our analysis of climate projections that indicate increased hydroclimate variability by the latter half of the 21st century keywords hydrologic modeling hydrologic extremes hydrologic sensitivity hydroclimatology 1 introduction the year to year variability of annual streamflow in the upper missouri river basin umrb fig 1 has roughly doubled in the most recent 20 yr window compared to prior decades dating to 1898 fig 2 this rise in volatility with nine of the ten highest annual streamflows in the umrb historical record occurring after 1970 was capped by the record 2011 flood event a central motivation for this study is the fact that while the 2011 water year precipitation was not the highest historical total since 1898 fig 2 middle panel 2011 did produce the highest streamflow totals this fact alone implies that particular aspects of moisture delivery in 2011 both temporally and spatially were uniquely effective in generating the extreme umrb streamflow further highlighting the uniqueness of 2011 was the record high runoff ratio for the period of record fig 2 bottom panel in which 2011 runoff ratio the coefficient of annual streamflow to annual precipitation of 0 165 was nearly double the climatological mean 0 086 better understanding of flood drivers can inform preparedness efforts and mitigate associated high costs smith and matthews 2015 this paper aims to quantify the importance of key mechanisms responsible for individual extreme high annual streamflow events and explore whether the major flood event could have been anticipated on the basis of meteorology antecedent moisture conditions and historical trends in these quantities we ask what factors principally control the occurrence of high streamflow in the umrb the seasonal peak of which occurs in late spring hoerling et al 2013 explored the relationship between umrb flooding and oceanic conditions using a large ensemble of general circulation model gcm simulations they found high runoff to be correlated with a pacific wide la nina pattern however even perfect foresight of the sea surface temperature sst conditions and the la nina conditions revealed only a modest 10 increase in the likelihood for high regional precipitation concluding that ocean conditions were not an appreciable contributing factor here we go beyond hoerling et al 2013 and attribute the local flooding to local mechanisms including land surface conditions using high resolution land surface model simulations driven by historically observed meteorology our analysis poses the problem of streamflow variability as a forcing response problem by asking 1 are atmospheric conditions the principal driver for variability in annual umrb streamflow from 1950 to 2013 and 2 can we reasonably foresee extreme streamflow events from the prior year s land surface conditions overall the key contributions of addressing these questions will be quantify the mechanisms driving extreme land surface responses and assess the predictability of high streamflow situations over the umrb in particular the unique application of an ensemble technique to isolate and diagnose contributing factors to an extreme event for a major river basin like the umrb is viewed as a method having more general application to other river basins in the context of our first question we ask whether the historical sequence of daily precipitation maximum and minimum surface temperatures were the principal drivers for the overall variability in annual umrb streamflow a variety of factors are known to contribute to surface streamflow production including meteorology antecedent moisture conditions land use land cover and soil texture meteorological factors are often cited as dictating large scale moisture delivery year to year streamflow variability and long term trends e g stone et al 2003 land use can affect local surface runoff conveyance to streams with vegetation cover sedimentation channeling urbanization among the factors influencing the efficiency of converting atmospheric moisture delivery into streamflow e g pegg et al 2003 we use historically observed meteorological conditions to force the land surface moisture states and streamflow production in an offline mode with a land surface model that has been calibrated towards umrb streamflow we address whether the trend toward more extreme annual streamflow is reconcilable with historical trends in meteorological conditions analysis of sub basin fig 1 streamflow sensitivity through time permits an evaluation of the importance of changes in the seasonality and spatial pattern of moisture delivery with respect to our second question we ask whether extreme values of late spring peak in the seasonal hydrograph at sioux city might have been foreseen by knowledge of initial land surface conditions on 1 october of the prior year salley et al 2016 showed that higher water holding capacity soils in parts of the northern great plains region can be more resilient to extreme rainfall shifts in contrast to lower capacity soils with less buffering ability it is known that initial information on snow water equivalent swe and soil moisture states can contribute to skillful streamflow prediction koster et al 2010 reager et al 2014 changes in the management of the river and the consumptive use of water can also be important though the impact of these effects on the streamflow data has been accounted by the u s army corps of engineers usace through the development of naturalized streamflow developed using a maintenance of variance extension type 1 move 1 technique and water balance approach e g outflow is equal to inflow plus or minus changes in storage and diversions this naturalized flow is suitable for comparison with our vic simulations since it reflects the streamflow that results primarily from natural processes simulated by the model the result is a time series of monthly naturalized streamflow at sioux city fig 2 based on recorded diversions and impoundments usace 2006 in this study we undertake a systematic analysis of such initial land factors compared to subsequent meteorological factors that evolve during winter and spring the impact of such land initial states is compared to the control exerted by subsequent meteorological conditions finally we repose this question from a later start date 1 march consistent with typical water supply forecasts and explore relevant changes in predictability in section 2 we describe the meteorological data used to drive the land model provide details of the land surface model including its calibration appraise its ability to simulate the naturalized sioux city streamflow during 1950 2013 section 3 includes results from our ensemble streamflow simulations to diagnose antecedent moisture and atmospheric forcing contributors to streamflow sensitivity section 4 explores unique features of the 2011 extreme

contributions of antecedent moisture versus atmospheric forcing the approach taken in this study is a unique application of ensemble streamflow prediction esp and reverse esp applied as a diagnostic tool for an unprecedented extreme flood event esp and reverse esp wood et al 2016 wood and lettenmaier 2008 are techniques that use several decades of historical model simulations to diagnose the roles of antecedent moisture and seasonal climate forecasts on streamflow predictability typically applied to small watersheds by either an ensemble of seasonal climate forcings esp or an ensemble of the model s initial conditions reverse esp by which their relative importance on streamflow prediction can be ascertained we use 2011 as a case study for diagnosing the importance of the antecedent moisture conditions amc versus water year atmospheric forcing wyf on extreme streamflow in the umrb parallel vic sensitivity experiments were performed by shuffling either amcs at the start of each

importantly an ensemble of 40 model simulations is available such that the central tendency mean of all model simulations n 40 can provide an estimate of the externally forced climate change while the spread among the simulations reveals effects of unforced internal variability using this ensemble the likelihood of extreme streamflow events in the future can be estimated as well as providing a general overview of future hydroclimatology 3 results 3 1 vic model performance evaluation of historical simulations with naturalized streamflow provides an important measure of performance from which to conduct idealized experiments a common evaluation metric is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 while we also analyze others including the annual and monthly pearson correlation as well as the ratio of model to observed monthly standard deviation a measure of how well the model simulates variability particularly important when simulating alternative climate scenarios hydrologic modeling challenges have been well documented over the umrb region by numerous studies with a class of comparable models both xia et al 2012 and newman et al 2015 conduct national scale hydrologic assessments and highlight the umrb and great plains as regions with the among lowest nses typically less than 0 3 across a range of models the 64 year monthly hydrograph of naturalized streamflow at sioux city ia and streamflow from the umrb produced by the calibrated vic model are compared in fig 4 the model captures the seasonal timing of peak streamflow and achieves a nse of 0 59 which is deemed as satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 although vic does not capture early spring streamflow events that are present in the naturalized record further analysis of the inter annual variability of simulated streamflow demonstrates a 0 90 and 0 81 correlation between naturalized vic streamflow at annual and monthly intervals respectively perhaps most important for validating the model s ability to replicate streamflow variability the ratio of model to observed monthly standard deviation is 0 99 additionally when analyzing vic s capability to capture the naturalized extreme high streamflow annual events years 1975 1978 1986 1993 1995 1996 1997 2010 and 2011 seven of the nine extreme naturalized streamflow years were ranked accordingly in vic s extreme streamflow years in summary the fidelity of model portrayals of monthly and annual variability as well as capturing top ranking extreme events lends confidence in this calibrated version of vic to simulate key sensitivity to known meteorological forcing from which we can proceed to explore sensitivities to idealized forcings 3 2 antecedent moisture conditions and water year forcing experiments the wyf experiments reveal that the 2011 wy forcing uniquely produces the most extreme umrb streamflow both in terms of peak and cumulative values relative to all other historical water year atmospheric forcings fig 5 this occurs even though the wy precipitation observed in 2011 was not the highest historical total since 1898 fig 2 bottom panel this implies that additional features of moisture delivery in 2011 including its temporal and spatial patterns were uniquely effective in generating the extreme umrb streamflow nonetheless high historical streamflow wys are all typically among the largest precipitation years with the wyf experiments revealing statistically significant correlations between water year precipitation with peak streamflows 0 64 p 0 05 and cumulative water year streamflow 0 83 p 0 05 the amc experiments fig 5c and d show that antecedent moisture conditions on 1 october 2010 did not yield the greatest streamflow relative to other historical years a significant sample of other 1 october soil moisture conditions had they occurred in 2010 would have led to an even larger record streamflow that water year in this context the 2011 flood could have been conceivably more severe than it was on the basis of antecedent moisture it is further evident that the sensitivity to historical antecedent moisture is much less than the sensitivity to historical wy meteorological forcings compare fig 5a b and c d all vic simulations in the amc ensemble yield a peak streamflow of greater than 8 million acre feet maf the 86th percentile in the control simulation compared with just 8 out of 64 12 5 years in the wyf experiments above 8 maf this marked increase in peak streamflow confirms that the 2011 atmospheric forcing is the distinguishing feature responsible for the extreme streamflow nevertheless a strong correlation between the antecedent moisture and both peak streamflow 0 795 and the cumulative annual streamflow total 0 876 is found these positive statistically significant correlations p 0 05 confirm that antecedent moisture at least partially drives the streamflow for the following year the result affirms the widely accepted idea that precipitation falling on a nearly saturated soil column becomes streamflow more readily than on a less saturated column and can hence contribute to large streamflow events overall these experiments consistently indicate that years other than 2011 had antecedent moisture conditions capable of driving an even greater flood event than was observed albeit those years did not receive the same large precipitation as was observed in 2011 the antecedent moisture states alone were insufficient to identify the high historical streamflow years while we clearly show that the notably wet meteorological conditions were essential in producing the very high streamflow regardless of the land surface moisture this experimental framework establishes quantitative evidence of the leading role of meteorological forcing in streamflow generation for the 2011 event as an overall synthesis of driving factors the vic results indicate an incidental combination of anomalously wet antecedent moisture conditions with subsequent very wet meteorology setting up a near optimal spatial and temporal moisture delivery although 1 october is a valuable time to anticipate spring streamflows most forecasts typically do not begin until march hence an analogous set of simulations to the above were conducted initialized on 1 march to characterize the importance of wyf and amc on extreme streamflow from a more realistic forecast date relative to figs 5 and 6 shows increased importance of antecedent moisture for both the amc and wyf experiments among these the wyf experiment in fig 6a is most akin to an operational forecast where the 1 march 2011 amcs initialize an ensemble of hydrologic simulations using wyfs from all years importantly the relatively wet 2011 amc produces an entire ensemble of simulations with peak streamflow above the historical median indicating that a large streamflow peak was inevitable in 2011 much more so than the larger spread in the 1 october initialization fig 5a the same can be said when contrasting fig 6b with fig 5b yet because the record precipitation anomaly occurred after the 1 march initialization i e in may 2011 see fig 7 a next section the amc on 1 march 2011 did not drive all traces towards record streamflow levels fig 6c shows the application of the 2011 forcing to all amcs initialized on 1 march since peak streamflow occurs only 3 months after initialization the persistence of amcs produced a larger spread in peak streamflow among ensemble members relative to fig 5c recalling that 8 maf corresponded with the 86th percentile in the control we note that for the amc experiments 8 maf became the 0th percentile for 1 october initializations 63 of 63 simulations exceed 8 maf and the 33rd percentile in 1 march initializations 42 of 63 exceed 8 maf when analyzing peak streamflow changes regardless of the experiment or start date the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles all increase not shown notably the amc experiments yield 57 4 october start and 9 5 march start increases in peak streamflow over their wyf counterparts percent increases in the 5th percentile is larger than those of the 95th percentile together with the increases in the median this highlights a shift and a skewing of the probability distribution of the peak streamflows overall the large differences in hydrologic response between wyf and amc experiments initialized on 1 october become less pronounced for the 1 march experiments leading to the conclusion that knowledge of antecedent moisture becomes as vital as knowledge of atmospheric states are shorter lead times using 1 march as an antecedent moisture condition in wyf experiments the 2011 water year stands out in this ensemble and was only surpassed by the 1995 water year forcing whereas the 2011 water year streamflow was the largest streamflow in the 1 october initializations for context the 1 march initialization of the amc experiments had three other antecedent moisture states 1969 1972 and 1997 producing greater streamflow than was observed in 2011 compared to nine 1951 1952 1966 1973 1983 1987 1994 1996 and 1998 producing greater streamflow than in 2011 when using 1 october as opposed to the 1 october initializations both wyf and acm experiments with 1 march initializations have a statistically significant change in variability of annual peak streamflow 4 discussion the prior results reveal that an extreme streamflow year in the umrb does not necessarily result from an initial state having the wettest antecedent moisture conditions or a wy meteorological state having the most precipitation rather a combination of both is most typically involved which when convolved produces an extreme hydrologic event using the record setting 2011 umrb flood event as an example we further explore the conditions that led to the 2011 event and identify its drivers 4 1 unique hydrologic features of the 2011 event the 2011 wy precipitation exhibited a 36 7 increase in cold season precipitation relative to climatology while also being above average for most of the spring and early summer fig 7a with record precipitation in may fig 7b shows the extent of the umrb anomalous precipitation for the cold season of the 2011 wy 1 october 2010 to 31 march 2011 with 18 7 of the domain showing statistically significant high cold season precipitation p 0 05 furthermore 49 5 of the domain had precipitation that was greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean and 89 7 of the domain experienced above average precipitation during the 2011 wy cold season to isolate the importance of atmospheric versus antecedent moisture drivers we bin the observed streamflows into four regimes based on basin wide means of observed precipitation and vic simulated antecedent moisture states associated with 1 october conditions i e asm simulation initialization states into four groups 1 above average precipitation and above average antecedent moisture 2 above average precipitation and below average antecedent moisture 3 below average precipitation and above average antecedent moisture and 4 below average precipitation and below average antecedent moisture the separation of the annual hydrographs for the four bins fig 8 a demonstrates distinct streamflow behavior among these regimes the above average precipitation years produce greater streamflow than below average precipitation years and antecedent moisture tends to play only a muted role it follows that all nine extreme streamflow events previously listed since 1975 had above average precipitation by contrast only five had above average soil wetness including 2011 this regime discrimination is generally shared for each of all umrb sub basins fig 1 with the notable exception of the reach between gavins point and sioux city sub basin 6 this sub basin exhibits far greater sensitivity fig 8b to antecedent moisture conditions than the other five sub basins with a more even spread across groupings relative to those shown fig 8a we find an almost 50 increase in streamflow between the above and below average antecedent moisture regimes for the above average precipitation case by far the largest difference of any sub basin it is worth remarking that the gavins point to sioux city sub basin is the least regulated sub basin the umrb system and hence the most vulnerable to flood impacts given its importance we further explore the degree to which the 2011 wy antecedent moisture was anomalous relative to the 1950 2013 mean we find a large coherent region of significantly wet soils present in the gavins point to sioux city sub basin fig 8c at the start of the 2011 wy this interesting coincidence is worth highlighting i e that the region where streamflow is most sensitive to antecedent moisture in fact experienced anomalously wet conditions in 2011 contributing to high streamflow production during that respective wy it should be of note that the gavins point to sioux city sub basin saw an increase of almost 124 in streamflow production during the 2011 wy relative to the 1950 2013 climatology anomalous cold season precipitation can act to prime the land surface for heightened streamflow efficiency during spring and summer through increased soil wetness underlying seasonal snow cover this condition promotes greater streamflow and less infiltration during warm season snowmelt and precipitation events we expect this seasonal land surface moisture storage i e memory to be more prevalent for years with anomalous cold season precipitation given the energy limitation during this time that enable wet anomalies to therefore persist this priming of the land surface was further highlighted by the record high runoff ratio in the 2011 water year fig 2 bottom panel 4 2 trends and likelihood of flooding under a future climate to address the question of extremes in the background of an underlying trend we examine observationally based trends and modeled evolution of umrb precipitation and temperature in a future climate utilizing the monthly gridded prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model analyses for the period 1895 2014 at 4 km resolution daly et al 1994 we are able to ascertain seasonal trends in precipitation for the umrb fig 9 shows the changes in seasonal precipitation since 1895 averaged over the umrb as a whole cold season oct to mar precipitation has been observed to increase by 11 9 2 52 mm mon there are distinct spatial patterns to the cold season increase especially with the magnitude of wet trends being most intense over the central and eastern portion of the umrb notably the increases in the eastern portion of the basin may act exacerbate the role of the gavins point to sioux city sub basin that was noted to be acutely sensitive to antecedent moisture conditions additionally we extended seasonal trends in precipitation and applied them to the observed meteorology fig 7a red line and reran vic with this modified precipitation the resulting hydrograph analysis not shown showed modest increases in streamflow but did not approach streamflows on the order of the observed or vic modeled 2011 event this confirms that the 2011 event falls outside of the historical trend and cannot be exclusively explained based on long term trends in precipitation the cesm1 ensemble of historical simulations and their future extensions under a scenario of aggressive ghg emissions rcp8 5 taylor et al 2012 are examined to assess potential changing extremes in a future hydroclimate modest increases in wy precipitation are projected together with dramatic increases in temperature importantly there is considerable spread in the rainfall changes among individual runs such that multi decadal periods could have rainfall regimes much different from the modest wet signal of the ensemble mean conversely the warming signal becomes much larger than the intrinsic variability of temperature among ensemble members by the early mid 21st century indicative of a robust change steady warming of the basin nearly 4 c warmer than current climate by 2050 appears to contribute to a modest downward streamflow trend this decline is seen despite the overall increase in precipitation we interpret the streamflow declines as a response to increased evaporative demands that overwhelm the increase in precipitation by the latter half of the 21st century in concert with our result vano et al 2012 notes that in the neighboring upper colorado river basin that stream is expected to decline by 2 9 per degree celsius increase despite the overall decline in streamflow generation in the umrb in cesm1 the frequency of very high annual streamflow events increases consistent with the large variability in simulated streamflow fig 10 compares histograms of the exceedances in annual streamflow above the 90th percentile 50 maf of all years simulated by cesm1 the analysis is divided into three 40 year time slices one for the early 20th century top one for near current climate middle and one for the end of the 21st century bottom numerous extreme event exceedances are present in the statistics of streamflow at the end of the 21st century that are unprecedented relative to earlier periods also of note a similar change in low streamflow water year statistics is also found to occur in the cesm1 ensemble not shown with extreme low streamflow years in the late 21st century becoming more prevalent overall the projections paint a hydroclimate of the umrb in which annual streamflows become considerably more volatile owing to human induced climate change 5 conclusions ensemble sensitivity experiments were used to quantify the roles of antecedent moisture conditions and subsequent meteorological forcing in generating extreme annual streamflow in the umrb high annual streamflow was largely governed by high water year precipitation an unsurprising result that is generally expected in major river basins however an important effect of antecedent moisture conditions was also uncovered when above average precipitation occurred antecedent moisture had relatively minor impact on peak streamflow production for central and western sub basins yet in the lowest reach of the umrb gavins point to sioux city a marked sensitivity to antecedent moisture conditions was demonstrated this sensitivity was especially engaged in 2011 when the hydrologic simulation experiments and observations indicate that region experienced heighten streamflow efficiency and contributed an unusually large fraction to the overall umrb streamflow given the challenges associated with seasonal weather prediction identification of regions sensitive to antecedent moisture conditions such as the gavins point to sioux city reach can potentially aid in prediction of extreme streamflow events to better understand extreme streamflow in the umrb a detailed analysis of the 2011 record high streamflow event was conducted the extreme streamflow was principally due to high though not record values of precipitation delivered to the basin during the water year this meteorological factor was considerably more important for generating high streamflow than the high 1 october 2010 antecedent moisture conditions however a combination of these conditions was likely necessary to achieve the record setting streamflow repeating the experimentation from 1 march indicated that knowledge of antecedent spring soil moisture conditions was sufficient to predict above median peak streamflows that year yet with considerable spread across ensemble members our results suggest that the 2011 extreme event and others like it could not have been well anticipated based on knowledge of regional antecedent moisture alone nonetheless this paper s identification of a gavins point sioux city sub basin streamflow contribution related to high soil moisture sensitivity indicates some promise for potential predictability in the backdrop of the record 2011 streamflow this paper also addressed the question of extreme streamflow events in the background of a changing climate particularly striking given that nine of the highest 10 streamflow years since 1898 have occurred post 1970 observational trends highlight increased cold season precipitation oct to mar in the umrb most notably in the eastern portion of the basin that exhibits sensitivity to antecedent moisture conditions yet the extreme 2011 event could not have been foreseen on the basis of such long term trend information alone instead the analysis indicates that the 2011 extreme flood was an acute event that arose from a combination of unusual if not extreme land surface and meteorological forcings of that water year we also placed the increased frequency of extreme umrb streamflow events in to a context of human induced climate change with indications for an increased frequency in the latter half of the 21st century even while projections of strong surface warming acts to reduce annual mean streamflow in the basin this study uses ensemble land surface model experimentation in a new way to diagnose the mechanisms responsible for extreme annual streamflow production in the umrb sensitivities identified could aid in the prediction of extreme streamflow events in the umrb at least in a probabilistic sense they also motivate a need to better monitor soil moisture conditions across the basin insofar as such conditions may be a tractable means of harvesting predictability prediction of water year precipitation in the umrb is currently understood to be limited though any advances will be especially critical since it is the main driver of annual streamflow variability we would also add that the methods employed here may be useful for understanding extreme streamflow events in other major river basins beyond developing improved predictive capacity on seasonal to inter annual timescales better understanding streamflow sensitivities to land surface and meteorological drivers will be key in advancing knowledge on the probable hydroclimatology in future climates beyond the umrb conflict of interest we declare that there is no conflict of interest associated with this manuscript acknowledgments this work utilized the janus

8483,study region upper missouri river basin study focus the semi arid upper missouri river basin umrb has experienced notable volatility in high and low streamflow extremes in recent decades punctuated by the record 2011 flood this study provides a new perspective into the relative importance of precipitation and antecedent moisture conditions in driving extreme streamflow ensemble streamflow simulations demonstrate that precipitation is largely the dominant driver for high streamflows applying the observed atmospheric forcing in 2011 with initial conditions of antecedent hydrologic conditions from 64 historic years consistently produces large streamflow events exceeding the 85th percentile of historical peak flows this study attributes the individual roles of atmospheric conditions and antecedent soil moisture on extreme streamflow production it uses a novel modeling framework that provides a greater understanding for the role that heterogeneity in basin scale hydrologic features have in extreme streamflow generation new hydrologic insights for the region a detailed analysis of the record 2011 flood event shows that streamflow generated over the region s easternmost sub basin is acutely sensitive to antecedent moisture yet the 2011 record streamflow cannot be explained by a single factor or as the result of long term trends with the basin responding to several independent factors significantly high p 0 05 antecedent moisture and significant cold season precipitation perhaps most importantly was the record setting may precipitation which limited the ability of ensemble streamflow simulations initialized on 1 march from reliably predicting the record june streamflows the recent volatility of umrb streamflow may be a harbinger of future decades based on our analysis of climate projections that indicate increased hydroclimate variability by the latter half of the 21st century keywords hydrologic modeling hydrologic extremes hydrologic sensitivity hydroclimatology 1 introduction the year to year variability of annual streamflow in the upper missouri river basin umrb fig 1 has roughly doubled in the most recent 20 yr window compared to prior decades dating to 1898 fig 2 this rise in volatility with nine of the ten highest annual streamflows in the umrb historical record occurring after 1970 was capped by the record 2011 flood event a central motivation for this study is the fact that while the 2011 water year precipitation was not the highest historical total since 1898 fig 2 middle panel 2011 did produce the highest streamflow totals this fact alone implies that particular aspects of moisture delivery in 2011 both temporally and spatially were uniquely effective in generating the extreme umrb streamflow further highlighting the uniqueness of 2011 was the record high runoff ratio for the period of record fig 2 bottom panel in which 2011 runoff ratio the coefficient of annual streamflow to annual precipitation of 0 165 was nearly double the climatological mean 0 086 better understanding of flood drivers can inform preparedness efforts and mitigate associated high costs smith and matthews 2015 this paper aims to quantify the importance of key mechanisms responsible for individual extreme high annual streamflow events and explore whether the major flood event could have been anticipated on the basis of meteorology antecedent moisture conditions and historical trends in these quantities we ask what factors principally control the occurrence of high streamflow in the umrb the seasonal peak of which occurs in late spring hoerling et al 2013 explored the relationship between umrb flooding and oceanic conditions using a large ensemble of general circulation model gcm simulations they found high runoff to be correlated with a pacific wide la nina pattern however even perfect foresight of the sea surface temperature sst conditions and the la nina conditions revealed only a modest 10 increase in the likelihood for high regional precipitation concluding that ocean conditions were not an appreciable contributing factor here we go beyond hoerling et al 2013 and attribute the local flooding to local mechanisms including land surface conditions using high resolution land surface model simulations driven by historically observed meteorology our analysis poses the problem of streamflow variability as a forcing response problem by asking 1 are atmospheric conditions the principal driver for variability in annual umrb streamflow from 1950 to 2013 and 2 can we reasonably foresee extreme streamflow events from the prior year s land surface conditions overall the key contributions of addressing these questions will be quantify the mechanisms driving extreme land surface responses and assess the predictability of high streamflow situations over the umrb in particular the unique application of an ensemble technique to isolate and diagnose contributing factors to an extreme event for a major river basin like the umrb is viewed as a method having more general application to other river basins in the context of our first question we ask whether the historical sequence of daily precipitation maximum and minimum surface temperatures were the principal drivers for the overall variability in annual umrb streamflow a variety of factors are known to contribute to surface streamflow production including meteorology antecedent moisture conditions land use land cover and soil texture meteorological factors are often cited as dictating large scale moisture delivery year to year streamflow variability and long term trends e g stone et al 2003 land use can affect local surface runoff conveyance to streams with vegetation cover sedimentation channeling urbanization among the factors influencing the efficiency of converting atmospheric moisture delivery into streamflow e g pegg et al 2003 we use historically observed meteorological conditions to force the land surface moisture states and streamflow production in an offline mode with a land surface model that has been calibrated towards umrb streamflow we address whether the trend toward more extreme annual streamflow is reconcilable with historical trends in meteorological conditions analysis of sub basin fig 1 streamflow sensitivity through time permits an evaluation of the importance of changes in the seasonality and spatial pattern of moisture delivery with respect to our second question we ask whether extreme values of late spring peak in the seasonal hydrograph at sioux city might have been foreseen by knowledge of initial land surface conditions on 1 october of the prior year salley et al 2016 showed that higher water holding capacity soils in parts of the northern great plains region can be more resilient to extreme rainfall shifts in contrast to lower capacity soils with less buffering ability it is known that initial information on snow water equivalent swe and soil moisture states can contribute to skillful streamflow prediction koster et al 2010 reager et al 2014 changes in the management of the river and the consumptive use of water can also be important though the impact of these effects on the streamflow data has been accounted by the u s army corps of engineers usace through the development of naturalized streamflow developed using a maintenance of variance extension type 1 move 1 technique and water balance approach e g outflow is equal to inflow plus or minus changes in storage and diversions this naturalized flow is suitable for comparison with our vic simulations since it reflects the streamflow that results primarily from natural processes simulated by the model the result is a time series of monthly naturalized streamflow at sioux city fig 2 based on recorded diversions and impoundments usace 2006 in this study we undertake a systematic analysis of such initial land factors compared to subsequent meteorological factors that evolve during winter and spring the impact of such land initial states is compared to the control exerted by subsequent meteorological conditions finally we repose this question from a later start date 1 march consistent with typical water supply forecasts and explore relevant changes in predictability in section 2 we describe the meteorological data used to drive

spanning multiple decades for the 24 369 grid cells within the umrb domain approximately 100 total simulations sensitivity plus manual calibration adjustments were performed to arrive at the final parameter set the pattern of spatial variability for the soil parameters was based on the distribution of observationally based soil bulk density bulk density characterizes soil texture through the porosity and therefore much of the soil hydraulic properties relevant for hydrologic response daily vic simulated streamflows are aggregated to monthly values and are then compared to the united states army corps of engineers usace naturalized streamflow analyzing extreme streamflows on a monthly time step has the limitation of dampening any higher frequency acute streamflows associated with flooding usace conducted an analysis to reconstitute streamflows without the reservoir system for the purposes of determining the impacts of reservoir regulation on streamflow usace 2006 the natural

contributions of antecedent moisture versus atmospheric forcing the approach taken in this study is a unique application of ensemble streamflow prediction esp and reverse esp applied as a diagnostic tool for an unprecedented extreme flood event esp and reverse esp wood et al 2016 wood and lettenmaier 2008 are techniques that use several decades of historical model simulations to diagnose the roles of antecedent moisture and seasonal climate forecasts on streamflow predictability typically applied to small watersheds by either an ensemble of seasonal climate forcings esp or an ensemble of the model s initial conditions reverse esp by which their relative importance on streamflow prediction can be ascertained we use 2011 as a case study for diagnosing the importance of the antecedent moisture conditions amc versus water year atmospheric forcing wyf on extreme streamflow in the umrb parallel vic sensitivity experiments were performed by shuffling either amcs at the start of each water year 1 october or the evolution of atmospheric forcing variables throughout the water year 1 october to 30 september see fig 3 for an idealized schematic of the experiment design the amcs were

model version 1 cesm1 kay et al 2015 is used to contrast historical streamflow variability with future projections these all forcings simulations span 1920 2005 and use rcp8 5 for 2006 2100 importantly an ensemble of 40 model simulations is available such that the central tendency mean of all model simulations n 40 can provide an estimate of the externally forced climate change while the spread among the simulations reveals effects of unforced internal variability using this ensemble the likelihood of extreme streamflow events in the future can be estimated as well as providing a general overview of future hydroclimatology 3 results 3 1 vic model performance evaluation of historical simulations with naturalized streamflow provides an important measure of performance from which to conduct idealized experiments a common evaluation metric is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 while we also analyze others including the annual and monthly pearson correlation as well as the ratio of model to observed monthly standard deviation a measure of how well the model simulates variability particularly important when simulating alternative climate scenarios hydrologic modeling challenges have been well documented over the umrb region by numerous studies with a class of comparable models both xia et al 2012 and newman et al 2015 conduct national scale hydrologic assessments and highlight the umrb and great plains as regions with the among lowest nses typically less than 0 3 across a range of models the 64 year monthly hydrograph of naturalized streamflow at sioux city ia and streamflow from the umrb produced by the calibrated vic model are compared in fig 4 the model captures the seasonal timing of peak streamflow and achieves a nse of 0 59 which is deemed as satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 although vic does not capture early spring streamflow events that are present in the naturalized record further analysis of the inter annual variability of simulated streamflow demonstrates a 0 90 and 0 81 correlation between naturalized vic streamflow at annual and monthly intervals respectively perhaps most important for validating the model s ability to replicate streamflow variability the ratio of model to observed monthly standard deviation is 0 99 additionally when analyzing vic s capability to capture the naturalized extreme high streamflow annual events years 1975 1978 1986 1993 1995 1996 1997 2010 and 2011 seven of the nine extreme naturalized streamflow years were ranked accordingly in vic s extreme streamflow years in summary the fidelity of model portrayals of monthly and annual variability as well as capturing top ranking extreme events lends confidence in this calibrated version of vic to simulate key sensitivity to known meteorological forcing from which we can proceed to explore sensitivities to idealized forcings 3 2 antecedent moisture conditions and water year forcing experiments the wyf experiments reveal that the 2011 wy forcing uniquely produces the most extreme umrb streamflow both in terms of peak and cumulative values relative to all other historical water year atmospheric forcings fig 5 this occurs even though the wy precipitation observed in 2011 was not the highest historical total since 1898 fig 2 bottom panel this implies that additional features of moisture delivery in 2011 including its temporal and spatial patterns were uniquely effective in generating the extreme umrb streamflow nonetheless high historical streamflow wys are all typically among the largest precipitation years with the wyf experiments revealing statistically significant correlations between water year precipitation with peak streamflows 0 64 p 0 05 and cumulative water year streamflow 0 83 p 0 05 the amc experiments fig 5c and d show that antecedent moisture conditions on 1 october 2010 did not yield the greatest streamflow relative to other historical years a significant sample of other 1 october soil moisture conditions had they occurred in 2010 would have led to an even larger record streamflow that water year in this context the 2011 flood could have been conceivably more severe than it was on the basis of antecedent moisture it is further evident that the sensitivity to historical antecedent moisture is much less than the sensitivity to historical wy meteorological forcings compare fig 5a b and c d all vic simulations in the amc ensemble yield a peak streamflow of greater than 8 million acre feet maf the 86th percentile in the control simulation compared with just 8 out of 64 12 5 years in the wyf experiments above 8 maf this marked increase in peak streamflow confirms that the 2011 atmospheric forcing is the distinguishing feature responsible for the extreme streamflow nevertheless a strong correlation between the antecedent moisture and both peak streamflow 0 795 and the cumulative annual streamflow total 0 876 is found these positive statistically significant correlations p 0 05 confirm that antecedent moisture at least partially drives the streamflow for the following year the result affirms the widely accepted idea that precipitation falling on a nearly saturated soil column becomes streamflow more readily than on a less saturated column and can hence contribute to large streamflow events overall these experiments consistently indicate that years other than 2011 had antecedent moisture conditions capable of driving an even greater flood event than was observed albeit those years did not receive the same large precipitation as was observed in 2011 the antecedent moisture states alone were insufficient to identify the high historical streamflow years while we clearly show that the notably wet meteorological conditions were essential in producing the very high streamflow regardless of the land surface moisture this experimental framework establishes quantitative evidence of the leading role of meteorological forcing in streamflow generation for the 2011 event as an overall synthesis of driving factors the vic results indicate an incidental combination of anomalously wet antecedent moisture conditions with subsequent very wet meteorology setting up a near optimal spatial and temporal moisture delivery although 1 october is a valuable time to anticipate spring streamflows most forecasts typically do not begin until march hence an analogous set of simulations to the above were conducted initialized on 1 march to characterize the importance of wyf and amc on extreme streamflow from a more realistic forecast date relative to figs 5 and 6 shows increased importance of antecedent moisture for both the amc and wyf experiments among these the wyf experiment in fig 6a is most akin to an operational forecast where the 1 march 2011 amcs initialize an ensemble of hydrologic simulations using wyfs from all years importantly the relatively wet 2011 amc produces an entire ensemble of simulations with peak streamflow above the historical median indicating that a large streamflow peak was inevitable in 2011 much more so than the larger spread in the 1 october initialization fig 5a the same can be said when contrasting fig 6b with fig 5b yet because the record precipitation anomaly occurred after the 1 march initialization i e in may 2011 see fig 7 a next section the amc on 1 march 2011 did not drive all traces towards record streamflow levels fig 6c shows the application of the 2011 forcing to all amcs initialized on 1 march since peak streamflow occurs only 3 months after initialization the persistence of amcs produced a larger spread in peak streamflow among ensemble members relative to fig 5c recalling that 8 maf corresponded with the 86th percentile in the control we note that for the amc experiments 8 maf became the 0th percentile for 1 october initializations 63 of 63 simulations exceed 8 maf and the 33rd percentile in 1 march initializations 42 of 63 exceed 8 maf when analyzing peak streamflow changes regardless of the experiment or start date the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles all increase not shown notably the amc experiments yield 57 4 october start and 9 5 march start increases in peak streamflow over their wyf counterparts percent increases in the 5th percentile is larger than those of the 95th percentile together with the increases in the median this highlights a shift and a skewing of the probability distribution of the peak streamflows overall the large differences in hydrologic response between wyf and amc experiments initialized on 1 october become less pronounced for the 1 march experiments leading to the conclusion that knowledge of antecedent moisture becomes as vital as knowledge of atmospheric states are shorter lead times using 1 march as an antecedent moisture condition in wyf experiments the 2011 water year stands out in this ensemble and was only surpassed by the 1995 water year forcing whereas the 2011 water year streamflow was the largest streamflow in the 1 october initializations for context the 1 march initialization of the amc experiments had three other antecedent moisture states 1969 1972 and 1997 producing greater streamflow than was observed in 2011 compared to nine 1951 1952 1966 1973 1983 1987 1994 1996 and 1998 producing greater streamflow than in 2011 when using 1 october as opposed to the 1 october initializations both wyf and acm experiments with 1 march initializations have a statistically significant change in variability of annual peak streamflow 4 discussion the prior results reveal that an extreme streamflow year in the umrb does not necessarily result from an initial state having the wettest antecedent moisture conditions or a wy meteorological state having the most precipitation rather a combination of both is most typically involved which when convolved produces an extreme hydrologic event using the record setting 2011 umrb flood event as an example we further explore the conditions that led to the 2011 event and identify its drivers 4 1 unique hydrologic features of the 2011 event the 2011 wy precipitation exhibited a 36 7 increase in cold season precipitation relative to climatology while also being above average for most of the spring and early summer fig 7a with record precipitation in may fig 7b shows the extent of the umrb anomalous precipitation for the cold season of the 2011 wy 1 october 2010 to 31 march 2011 with 18 7 of the domain showing statistically significant high cold season precipitation p 0 05 furthermore 49 5 of the domain had precipitation that was greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean and 89 7 of the domain experienced above average precipitation during the 2011 wy cold season to isolate the importance of atmospheric versus antecedent moisture drivers we bin the observed streamflows into four regimes based on basin wide means of observed precipitation and vic simulated antecedent moisture states associated with 1 october conditions i e asm simulation initialization states into four groups 1 above average precipitation and above average antecedent moisture 2 above average precipitation and below average antecedent moisture 3 below average precipitation and above average antecedent moisture and 4 below average precipitation and below average antecedent moisture the separation of the annual hydrographs for the four bins fig 8 a demonstrates distinct streamflow behavior among these regimes the above average precipitation years produce greater streamflow than below average precipitation years and antecedent moisture tends to play only a muted role it follows that all nine extreme streamflow events previously listed since 1975 had above average precipitation by contrast only five had above average soil wetness including 2011 this regime discrimination is generally shared for each of all umrb sub basins fig 1 with the notable exception of the reach between gavins point and sioux city sub basin 6 this sub basin exhibits far greater sensitivity fig 8b to antecedent moisture conditions than the other five sub basins with a more even spread across groupings relative to those shown fig 8a we find an almost 50 increase in streamflow between the above and below average antecedent moisture regimes for the above average precipitation case by far the largest difference of any sub basin it is worth remarking that the gavins point to sioux city sub basin is the least regulated sub basin the umrb system and hence the most vulnerable to flood impacts given its importance we further explore the degree to which the 2011 wy antecedent moisture was anomalous relative to the 1950 2013 mean we find a large coherent region of significantly wet soils present in the gavins point to sioux city sub basin fig 8c at the start of the 2011 wy this interesting coincidence is worth highlighting i e that the region where streamflow is most sensitive to antecedent moisture in fact experienced anomalously wet conditions in 2011 contributing to high streamflow production during that respective wy it should be of note that the gavins point to sioux city sub basin saw an increase of almost 124 in streamflow production during the 2011 wy relative to the 1950 2013 climatology anomalous cold season precipitation can act to prime the land surface for heightened streamflow efficiency during spring and summer through increased soil wetness underlying seasonal snow cover this condition promotes greater streamflow and less infiltration during warm season snowmelt and precipitation events we expect this seasonal land surface moisture storage i e memory to be more prevalent for years with anomalous cold season precipitation given the energy limitation during this time that enable wet anomalies to therefore persist this priming of the land surface was further highlighted by the record high runoff ratio in the 2011 water year fig 2 bottom panel 4 2 trends and likelihood of flooding under a future climate to address the question of extremes in the background of an underlying trend we examine observationally based trends and modeled evolution of umrb precipitation and temperature in a future climate utilizing the monthly gridded prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model analyses for the period 1895 2014 at 4 km resolution daly et al 1994 we are able to ascertain seasonal trends in precipitation for the umrb fig 9 shows the changes in seasonal precipitation since 1895 averaged over the umrb as a whole cold season oct to mar precipitation has been observed to increase by 11 9 2 52 mm mon there are distinct spatial patterns to the cold season increase especially with the magnitude of wet trends being most intense over the central and eastern portion of the umrb notably the increases in the eastern portion of the basin may act exacerbate the role of the gavins point to sioux city sub basin that was noted to be acutely sensitive to antecedent moisture conditions additionally we extended seasonal trends in precipitation and applied them to the observed meteorology fig 7a red line and reran vic with this modified precipitation the resulting hydrograph analysis not shown showed modest increases in streamflow but did not approach streamflows on the order of the observed or vic modeled 2011 event this confirms that the 2011 event falls outside of the historical trend and cannot be exclusively explained based on long term trends in precipitation the cesm1 ensemble of historical simulations and their future extensions under a scenario of aggressive ghg emissions rcp8 5 taylor et al 2012 are examined to assess potential changing extremes in a future hydroclimate modest increases in wy precipitation are projected together with dramatic increases in temperature importantly there is considerable spread in the rainfall changes among individual runs such that multi decadal periods could have rainfall regimes much different from the modest wet signal of the ensemble mean conversely the warming signal becomes much larger than the intrinsic variability of temperature among ensemble members by the early mid 21st century indicative of a robust change steady warming of the basin nearly 4 c warmer than current climate by 2050 appears to contribute to a modest downward streamflow trend this decline is seen despite the overall increase in precipitation we interpret the streamflow declines as a response to increased evaporative demands that overwhelm the increase in precipitation by the latter half of the 21st century in concert with our result vano et al 2012 notes that in the neighboring upper colorado river basin that stream is expected to decline by 2 9 per degree celsius increase despite the overall decline in streamflow generation in the umrb in cesm1 the frequency of very high annual streamflow events increases consistent with the large variability in simulated streamflow fig 10 compares histograms of the exceedances in annual streamflow above the 90th percentile 50 maf of all years simulated by cesm1 the analysis is divided into three 40 year time slices one for the early 20th century top one for near current climate middle and one for the end of the 21st century bottom numerous extreme event exceedances are present in the statistics of streamflow at the end of the 21st century that are unprecedented relative to earlier periods also of note a similar change in low streamflow water year statistics is also found to occur in the cesm1 ensemble not shown with extreme low streamflow years in the late 21st century becoming more prevalent overall the projections paint a hydroclimate of the umrb in which annual streamflows become considerably more volatile owing to human induced climate change 5 conclusions ensemble sensitivity experiments were used to quantify the roles of antecedent moisture conditions and subsequent meteorological forcing in generating extreme annual streamflow in the umrb high annual streamflow was largely governed by high water year precipitation an unsurprising result that is generally expected in major river basins however an important effect of antecedent moisture conditions was also uncovered when above average precipitation occurred antecedent moisture had relatively minor impact on peak streamflow production for central and western sub basins yet in the lowest reach of the umrb gavins point to sioux city a marked sensitivity to antecedent moisture conditions was demonstrated this sensitivity was especially engaged in 2011 when the hydrologic simulation experiments and observations indicate that region experienced heighten streamflow efficiency and contributed an unusually large fraction to the overall umrb streamflow given the challenges associated with seasonal weather prediction identification of regions sensitive to antecedent moisture conditions such as the gavins point to sioux city reach can potentially aid in prediction of extreme streamflow events to better understand extreme streamflow in the umrb a detailed analysis of the 2011 record high streamflow event was conducted the extreme streamflow was principally due to high though not record values of precipitation delivered to the basin during the water year this meteorological factor was considerably more important for generating high streamflow than the high 1 october 2010 antecedent moisture conditions however a combination of these conditions was likely necessary to achieve the record setting streamflow repeating the experimentation from 1 march indicated that knowledge of antecedent spring soil moisture conditions was sufficient to predict above median peak streamflows that year yet with considerable spread across ensemble members our results suggest that the 2011 extreme event and others like it could not have been well anticipated based on knowledge of regional antecedent moisture alone nonetheless this paper s identification of a gavins point sioux city sub basin streamflow contribution related to high soil moisture sensitivity indicates some promise for potential predictability in the backdrop of the record 2011 streamflow this paper also addressed the question of extreme streamflow events in the background of a changing climate particularly striking given that nine of the highest 10 streamflow years since 1898 have occurred post 1970 observational trends highlight increased cold season precipitation oct to mar in the umrb most notably in the eastern portion of the basin that exhibits sensitivity to antecedent moisture conditions yet the extreme 2011 event could not have been foreseen on the basis of such long term trend information alone instead the analysis indicates that the 2011 extreme flood was an acute event that arose from a combination of unusual if not extreme land surface and meteorological forcings of that water year we also placed the increased frequency of extreme umrb streamflow events in to a context of human induced climate change with indications for an increased frequency in the latter half of the 21st century even while projections of strong surface warming acts to reduce annual mean streamflow in the basin this study uses ensemble land surface model experimentation in a new way to diagnose the mechanisms responsible for extreme annual streamflow production in the umrb sensitivities identified could aid in the prediction of extreme streamflow events in the umrb at least in a probabilistic sense they also motivate a need to better monitor soil moisture conditions across the basin insofar as such conditions may be a tractable means of harvesting predictability prediction of water year precipitation in the umrb is currently understood to be limited though any advances will be especially critical since it is the main driver of annual streamflow variability we would also add that the methods employed here may be useful for understanding extreme streamflow events in other major river basins beyond developing improved predictive capacity on seasonal to inter annual timescales better understanding streamflow sensitivities to land surface and meteorological drivers will be key in advancing knowledge on the probable hydroclimatology in future climates beyond the umrb conflict of interest we declare that there is no conflict of interest associated with this manuscript acknowledgments this work utilized the janus

1 climate risk assessment climate risk assessment in east africa is subjected to high uncertainty in the precipitation projections james et al 2014 dosio et al 2015 water resources models forced with the precipitation projections aggregates uncertainty by the cascade of models and could lead to a potential climate maladaptation wilby and dessai 2010 a novel decision support method known as decision scaling brown et al 2012 was proposed in which climate projections are used to inform decisions related to risk mitigation rather than being directly used as forcing to water resource models the method has been applied climate risk assessment on the reliability of municipal water supply brown and wilby 2012 flood risk analysis steinschneider et al 2015 suspended sediment transport bussi et al 2016 and flood inundation and protection costs poff et al 2016 here we apply the decision scaling approach to assess the resilience of the turkwel basin water resource system to climate change and variability and to growing water demand the method consists of three major steps 1 identifying water related risks through engagement with local stakeholders 2 determining climate conditions that can lead to those risks and constructing a climate response surface and 3 assessing climate risk using data from gcm climate projections 3 1 1 water related risk in the basin we identified water related risks in the basin through meetings with local stakeholders and an ongoing engagement through reach improving water security for the poor programme https reachwater org uk the frequent droughts intensive upstream abstraction from the river and flow regulation by the dam are perceived to cause water scarcity in the basin we categorised the risks into four classes table 1 to depict the level to which the water demand is met and the degree of reliance on groundwater sources to satisfy the demand the risk level could increase from low to high as a result of a reduced precipitation amount a rapid increase in water demand or a combination thereof the severe risk level is the most unsustainable since it means that agricultural water demand cannot be met during the growing season potentially leading to crop failure and that groundwater could severely be depleted 3 1 2 climate scenarios we constructed a climate response surface to identify climate conditions that potentially lead to the identified risk under a specific water demand condition to do this we iteratively run a water resources model section 3 3 using a range of climate scenarios produced by applying change factors to the observed monthly precipitation and temperature values for future climate we derived climate change information from the fifth phase of coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 multi model gcm projections http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 the precipitation change factor was computed from percentage changes in the mean monthly values between cmip5 future projections and historical runs for temperature an additive change factor was estimated two future time slices were considered near term 2021 2050 or 2030s and long term 2071 2100 or 2080s the period 1981 2005 was selected as the baseline because the cmip5 historical runs end in 2005 to account for the decadal variability and reduce the related sampling uncertainty we derived the change factors between the two future 30 year time blocks and the baseline period from all continuous pairs of 20 year blocks drawn from the future periods and the baseline prudhomme et al 2010 then for each month the median of the change factors calculated from each 20 year block average was considered as climate change factor between the future and the baseline in a separate analysis we used data from historical el niño southern oscillation enso years 1950 83 to test if there was a link between global climate variability and the rainfall in the basin and consequently show the impact on the water resource system of the basin specifically we quantified the monthly precipitation deficit during the most recent severe drought and show the level of risk it posed on the water resources system of the basin fourteen years with the strongest enso signal from a 1950 83 period were identified based on the multivariate enso index mei wolter and timlin 2011 averaged over the winter months december february the djf months provide the clearest indication for the strength of the enso events https www esrl noaa gov psd enso past events html accordingly there were 6 el niño and 8 la niña years table 2 while the remaining 20 years were neutral years for the enso years for consistency with the other climate data described above we estimated the mean monthly deviation from the baseline period 1984 2013 note that the el niño years have a wide range of precipitation anomalies in the basin 34 4 to 41 6 annually 4 7 average but the la niña years have mostly dry anomalies 35 4 to 10 7 annually 11 4 average however given the large variation in the precipitation anomalies the enso years may not be used as an indication for the wetness or dryness of the basin 3 2 water demand scenarios to investigate the impact of growing demand on the sustainability of the basin s water resources and how it affects the climate risk we used different water demand scenarios of irrigation and domestic water demand table 3 the industrial water demand and environmental flow requirements were unchanged we considered three scenarios of irrigated areas the first scenario a1 corresponds with the existing crop irrigation mainly consisting of maize 75 and sorghum 24 maina et al 2013 the second irrigation scenario of 100 km2 a2 was based on the estimated potential in the basin but with the same crop composition as the scenario a1 the third scenario a3 also has the same crop composition but a larger area of 250 km2 we considered two scenarios for lodwar population growth rates the first scenario p1 is equal to kenya national average population growth rate 2 7 the second scenario p2 is approximately the same as the estimated population growth rate for turkana county 6 0 considering the recent decentralisation and the associated population growth in the town the p2 scenario is likely a more realistic estimate for the rapidly growing population in the town than the p1 scenario for each scenario domestic water consumption is set at 50 litres per day per capita a value that is consistent with the water poverty index for developing countries gleick 1996 but which is less than the estimated per capita consumption in nairobi otieno 2005 3 3 model and data we used the water evaluation and planning version 21 weap21 model http www weap21 org yates et al 2005 for hydrological process modelling and water allocation see appendix s1 we set up the model for the turkwel river basin with three demand sites lodwar town irrigated agriculture and oil industry a hydropower reservoir and in stream flow requirement fig 2 each demand site is supplied with water from the river and shallow groundwater we assigned the highest demand priority to the in stream environmental flow to match kenya s regulations while all other users have the same lower priority note that the highest demand priority assigned to the environmental flow may not be in practice in the basin e g due to unregulated abstractions upstream however in the current model setup we assume it remains the highest priority similarly it is possible to establish the supply preferences to a given demand site when there are multiple water supply sources however we assume here that there is no supply preference between stream and groundwater we estimated the required environmental flow ef as q95 of the simulated natural mean monthly flow fig s2 the q95 flow estimated at the outlet to lake turkana is 10 m3 s we estimated the water need for each demand site as follows water consumptions in lodwar town and the irrigation water demand scenarios were presented in section 3 2 we set water demand for industry oil production at 10 000 m3 per day a value which reflects the initial phase of oil production but this value could vary depending on the production extent oil exploration began only recently in 2014 and therefore the time period over which production might run is not clear in our analysis we have assumed a uniform industrial demand for all years during the study period 4 results 4 1 impact of recent drought on the base flow in the basin seventy percent of the months during the severe 2014 2016 drought experienced drier conditions compared to the long term average 1984 2013 fig 3 notably the start of the growing season march received consistently low rainfall for all three years there was large seasonal variation in the precipitation anomaly during the drought years in 2014 ten months except august and october experienced varying magnitudes of precipitation deficit with the highest dry anomaly 78 observed in april while 2015 experienced a relatively mild rainfall deficit the second half of 2016 had an extremely dry anomaly ranging from 20 july to 80 december with an average june december deficit of 40 the 2016 rainfall deficit was consistent with what was observed in arid parts of kenya and in other countries in the region and triggered the declaration of national disaster in the country fews net 2017 the normally perennial turkwel river was completely dry at lodwar town during the first weeks of march 2017 fig 4 illustrates the reduction in baseflow as the result of the low groundwater recharge linked to the extreme drought overall the total rainfall for the month was significantly lower than the long term average the lowland plain sc4 received 40 16 mm month of the long term average while the estimated basin average was only 34 25 mm month furthermore a significant proportion of the total rainfall accumulated in march 2017 68 for sc4 and 76 for the basin was recorded over a four day timespan march 25 28 suggesting that the rainfall over the remaining days of the month was exceptionally below normal fig 4b shows the flood flow as a response to the four day rainfall however it quickly receded to a near dry level just one day after the rain stopped fig 4c the quick flow recession is indicative of the significant baseflow reduction during the extreme drought of 2016 17 in the basin this emphasizes the impact of long severe drought on groundwater recharge and its destructive effects on water resources of the basin 4 2 the basin s response to climate variability the climate response surface for the turkwel river basin is shown in fig 5 the response surface estimated based on historical climate 1984 2013 and the conservative a1p1 water demand conditions indicates the combinations of climate conditions that may potentially lead to unsatisfied water demand a higher risk of groundwater depletion or both we represented the range of climate possibilities by increasing or decreasing the monthly precipitation values by a percentage factor ranging from 50 to 50 and warming temperature up to 6 c compared to the baseline the climate response surface shows a severe risk under historical climate conditions i e no change in precipitation and temperature and a conservative water demand scenario this means that the basin has historically been water stressed failing to satisfy demand in one or more growing seasons during the 30 year considered even with high rates of groundwater depletion an increase in precipitation reduces the risk of water scarcity in the basin for example it is estimated that an increase in the monthly precipitation by 5 compared to the baseline with other conditions remaining unchanged meets the water demand during the growing season level 3 for all years during the study period in other words if single season march september irrigation is practiced then the agricultural water demand can be fully met a 15 increase in precipitation is estimated to reduce the groundwater abstraction 15 and a 30 increase fully meets the water demand without a significant reduction in groundwater storage conversely reduced precipitation or warming temperature will increase the risk of water scarcity in the basin a decrease in precipitation reduces both the surface water availability and the groundwater recharge while warming temperature increases evapotranspiration which then decreases the available surface water and thereby leads to a higher reliance on groundwater supply it is estimated that a mean monthly precipitation increase of at least 15 30 is required to maintain the medium low risk level without warming temperature the minimum precipitation required to maintain medium low risk levels increases to 20 35 at a 1 5 c warming level which is expected to occur in the 2030s under the rcp8 5 scenario in the basin moss 2008 with a warming by 4 2 c expected to occur in the 2080s in the basin under the rcp8 5 scenario a minimum of 30 45 precipitation increase is needed to reduce the risk level to a medium low level 4 3 impact of climate change and variability the change factors computed from the cmip5 high end rcp8 5 projections for the near term 2030s and long term 2080s superimposed on the climate response surface is shown in fig 5 a total of 37 18 gcm models provide combined precipitation and temperature runs for both the 2030s 2080s and historical 1980 2005 periods the results indicate that significant majority of gcms predict a wetter and a warmer future for the turkwel river basin however studies in east africa have documented that climate models wrongly predict increasing rainfall trends in the coming decades rowell et al 2015 we observed that about one third of the models predict more than 50 precipitation increase for both 2030s and 2080s compared to the baseline they also predict a warmer future with average increases of 1 5 c and 4 2 c for the near term and long term respectively the gcms with relatively better seasonality and trend agreement with the historical climate white marked in fig 5 show similar tendency of wetter and warmer future the risk of the future climate change alone on the water resources of the turkwel river basin is therefore inconclusive and may if taken uncritically as a projection of greater abundance of water resources create the potential for serious maladaptation e g magnan et al 2016 under the conservative a1p1 water demand conditions 43 39 of the gcms indicate a low risk of in 2030s 2080s 11 28 a medium risk 30 17 a high risk and 16 17 of the gcms indicate a severe risk in 2030s 2080s to investigate how the climate variability may impact the water resources of the basin we displayed all the historical years 1950 83 including 6 el niño 8 la niña and 20 neutral years as earlier the enso years show large precipitation variability that ranges between 41 5 and 34 4 compared to the baseline period while the la niña years were on average drier in the basin there was clear indication of la niña leading to positive and el niño to negative precipitation anomalies and vice versa overall half of the 34 years had precipitation deficits that could lead to a severe risk of water scarcity under the a1p1 demand condition the severe risk level means that the water demand was unmet during the growing season and the groundwater abstraction was high seven years 20 resulted in a high risk while 4 years 12 led to a medium risk the low risk level of fully meeting water demand with low level of groundwater dependence was achieved for only 6 18 years indicating that the turkwel river basin has been historically water stressed the finding that the water demand is not fully met during the whole year for the majority of the historical years has an important implication in relation to proposals to move to agriculture with a longer growing season e g sugar cane where water availability is not adequate to satisfy the agricultural needs even during relatively wet years which suggests that it may not be sustainable to invest in large scale projects that requite year long irrigation in the basin unless additional water source is sought in summary while the validity of the wetting trend in the future climate projections remains doubtful the negative impacts of climate variability highlight the extent of water scarcity in the turkwel river basin 4 4 impact of increasing water demand fig 6 presents the shift in climate response surface due to the growing water demand results reveal that expanding irrigated agriculture from 18 km2 a1p1 to 100 km2 a2p1 crop significantly increases the water demand and leads to an increased risk of unsatisfied demand and groundwater depletion the climate risk level rises with a further expansion of irrigated agriculture to 250 km2 a3p1 under historical climate i e no change in precipitation and no warming temperature the total unmet demand increases from 0 1 a1p1 to 8 9 a3p1 of the total demand and groundwater depletion rises from 27 to 61 the amount of precipitation needed to achieve the lowest risk level level 1 with no warming shifts from 30 for the a1p1 to 40 and 50 of the monthly values for the a2p1 and a3p1 scenarios respectively while the population growth also increases the domestic water consumption it does not have as much impact on the risk curve as the irrigation expansion in the basin the risk level of future climate on the water scarcity rises with water demand fig 7 presents the probability of each of the four risk levels as the percentages of the gcms for each of the six water demand scenarios in the 2030s the probability of experiencing severe risk level 4 which includes the combined case of unmet water demand during the growing season and a very high rate of groundwater depletion grows three times from 16 to 49 as a result of the increase in water demand from a1p1 to a3p2 scenarios similarly the probability of the desirable low risk level 1 decreases from 43 to 22 making it much less likely than the severe risk for the highest demand a3p2 scenario we also found a comparable increase of the probability of the severe risk level with growing water demand in 2080s 17 at a1p1 and 44 for a3p2 scenarios 5 discussion 5 1 limited hydroclimatic data the limited hydroclimatic data and the large uncertainty in the future climate projections are two important limitations of applying the climate risk analysis in the turkwel river basin and yet this is a region in which long term investment decisions must be made immediately in the presence of limited information we are therefore explicitly interested in the level of inference that can be sustained based on the information that is available there is limited or no data accessibility on water abstraction from the river or groundwater sources there is an emerging but so far very limited understanding of the groundwater resources in the turkwel basin that requires further investigation addressing these issues is not a trivial task however it requires a great deal of resources and coordination among stakeholders it is of course vital that additional data be collected to support robust decision making in the basin however the likelihood of long lived economic investments being made without access to long records over a wide area is high and we have sought in our analysis to state carefully what inferences can be drawn about the resilience of the water resource system to future climate land use and development related stressors it is of course possible that new data will help increase the precision of the statements that we have felt able to make in the course of this work however unless there appears a new and substantial water supply source e g groundwater supply or inter basin water transfer it is unlikely that new streamflow data will radically alter our assessment of the sustainability of the range of development scenarios being considered 5 2 implications for policy makers our results show that a potential increase in irrigation water demand combined with high rate of population growth aggravates the impacts of drought such as those caused by global climate variability while increased food production could alleviate the food crisis it is also important to consider the additional stress the expanded irrigation puts on the water resources when development projects are planned kvda 2017 there is a recognized link between economic growth and water security in the region brown et al 2011 achieving sustainable economic development can be challenging without an integrated water resources management that includes managing trade offs between irrigation domestic industrial and environmental water demands and defining clear priorities among multiple development projects in the turkwel basin this may involve making decisions pertaining to changing irrigation practices vision 2030 2011vision 2030 2011 and adapting the dam which impounds 41 of the precipitation volume of the basin operation to the downstream water needs in order to release water from the reservoir for the environmental flows and other requirements water resources planning should consider development of groundwater sources this includes fully characterising the napuu aquifer system and its interactions with the turkwel river in order to quantify its sustainable use limits assess its capacity to buffer climate change impacts and to protect it from contamination as it directly underlies a rapidly growing lodwar town the planners also should also consider the errors in the projected rainfall trends in the region climate adaptation and investment planning based on the wrong gcm projections of increasing rainfall trends rowell et al 2015 could lead to a water scarce future the implementation of the existing regulations could be achieved through strengthening the institutional capacity of government agencies and local communities and designing effective water policies that take the local water resources and demand conditions into account to this end evidence based policy decisions will have direct implications on the level of progress towards effective climate risk reduction and mitigation efforts in the basin and other regions with limited data 6 conclusions we assessed the resilience of the data sparse turkwel river basin s water resources system to climate stressors and growing demand by applying the decision scaling climate risk analysis method the results reveal that climate variability and rapidly growing water demand are the main drivers of water scarcity in the basin the frequent occurrence of severe drought due to global climate variability substantially impacted the water availability by reducing runoff and groundwater recharge in addition excessive abstraction to satisfy the water demand due to expanded irrigation and population growth in the basin potentially leads to higher risks of unsatisfied water demand and groundwater depletion the scenario based analysis reveals that a potential increase in crop irrigation from 18 km2 to 250 km2 in the turkwel river basin under historical climate will increase the unmet water demand from 0 1 to 8 9 of the total demand and the loss in groundwater storage from 27 to 61 over the study period 1984 2013 furthermore the probability of experiencing severe risks of unmet water demand and groundwater depletion posed by future climate rises by three times as the result of the potential irrigation expansion taken together our results suggest that policy decisions related to water demand management will have important implications for water scarcity in the basin while every river basin has its unique set of water related challenges

8484,study region the turkwel river basin kenya experiences a high level of water scarcity due to its arid climate high rainfall variability and rapidly growing water demand study focus climate change variability and rapid growth in water demand pose significant challenges to current and future water resources planning and allocation worldwide in this paper a novel decision scaling approach was applied to model the response of the turkwel river basin s water resources system to growing demand and climate stressors a climate response surface was constructed by combining a water resource system model climate data and a range of water demand scenarios new hydrological insights the results show that climate variability and increased water demand are each important drivers of water scarcity in the basin increases in water demand due to expanded irrigation strongly influences on the resilience of the basin s water resource system to droughts caused by the global climate variability the climate response surface offers a visual and flexible tool for decision makers to understand the ways in which the system responds to climate variability and development scenarios policy decisions to accelerate water dependent development and poverty reduction in arid and semi arid lands that are characterised by rapid demographic political and economic change in the short to medium term have to promote low regrets approaches that incorporate longer term climate uncertainty keywords water scarcity drought water allocation climate change data sparse regions 1 introduction sustainability of global freshwater is under increasing threats due to changing hydroclimate and abstraction to satisfy rapidly growing water demand hall et al 2014 wada et al 2014 understanding how socio economic change put additional stress on water resources and translating the scientific evidence into policy decisions are critical steps towards ensuring sustainable water use and allocation sadoff and hall 2015 dadson et al 2017 regions where development is most acutely needed are often those where data to inform long term investment decisions is most severely lacking this paper analyses the drivers of water scarcity in a data sparse river basin and offers insights that can inform and challenge approaches to water resources planning in data sparse regions in other basins worldwide in east africa severe droughts often cause water and food crises affecting millions of people and livelihoods fews net 2017 about 3 4 million people in 23 arid and semiarid kenya counties required food assistance during the second half of 2017 kenya food security steering group 2017 turkana county was one of the most severely impacted ndma 2017 highly variable water resources and reduced flows in the turkwel river trigger large human and livestock migration in search of water across country borders to uganda and ethiopia johannes et al 2015 despite the critical importance of water in the basin the impact of hydro climatic variability and demand growth on the water resources of the basin remains poorly understood owing to the lack of scientific studies and limited biophysical data the objective of this paper is to identify the main drivers of water scarcity in the data sparse basin we estimate the resilience of the basin s water resources system to hydroclimatic changes and growing water demand by modifying the decision scaling method introduced by brown et al 2012 to account for the limited data availability using a water resources system model and historical climate data we construct a climate response surface that shows the ways in which the system responds the climate stressors further we assess the future climate risks using climate projections from global circulation models gcms and investigate the past impacts of the global climate variability using years with strong el niño southern oscillation enso events finally we show the impact of growing water demand using various demand scenarios estimated based on different levels of existing or planned agriculture and various population growth rates our findings demonstrate the importance of climate risk analysis in development planning and potential climate adaptation measures in regions with limited data to inform long term decisions 2 study area the turkwel river basin is located in north western kenya fig 1 the river originates in the uganda side of mount elgon and drains into lake turkana the largest desert lake in the world avery 2012 covering a total catchment area of 23 740 km2 the basin has a complex hydroclimate with highly diverse topography and a marked south west to north east rainfall gradient the southern highlands sc1 and sc2 receive between 900 and 1749 mm year while the arid northern lowland plains sc4 receive annual rainfall ranging from 99 to 400 mm year the basin experiences two rainy seasons march june long rain and october december short rain the river supplies water to several competing socio economic sectors turkwel gorge dam tgd 37 km2 reservoir area lehner et al 2011 produces106 mw which is the third largest hydroelectric power output of the country kengen

from the river in kenya environmental flows ef are defined as the q95 the 5 percentile flow of the natural flow the cascade of water abstraction points from the river and water loss and flow regulation from the dam can result in unmet ef requirements this may cause water stress and conflicts among pastoralists who account for 55 of turkana county population johannes et al 2015 3 method 3 1 climate risk assessment climate risk assessment in east africa is subjected to high uncertainty in the precipitation projections james et al 2014 dosio et al 2015 water resources models forced with the precipitation projections aggregates uncertainty by the cascade of models and could lead to a potential climate maladaptation wilby and dessai 2010 a novel decision support method known as decision scaling brown et al 2012 was proposed in which climate projections are used to inform decisions related to risk mitigation rather than being directly used as forcing to water resource models the method has been applied climate risk assessment on the reliability of municipal water supply brown and wilby 2012 flood risk analysis steinschneider et al 2015 suspended sediment transport bussi et al 2016 and flood inundation and protection costs poff et al 2016 here we apply the decision scaling approach to assess the resilience of the turkwel basin water resource system to climate change and variability and to growing water demand the method consists of three major steps 1 identifying water related risks through engagement with local stakeholders 2 determining climate conditions that can lead to those risks and constructing a climate response surface and 3 assessing climate risk using data from gcm climate projections 3 1 1 water related risk in the basin we identified water related risks in the basin through meetings with local stakeholders and an ongoing engagement through reach improving water security for the poor programme https reachwater org uk the frequent droughts intensive upstream abstraction from the river and flow regulation by the dam are perceived to cause water scarcity in the basin we categorised the risks into four classes table 1 to depict the level to which the water demand is met and the degree of reliance on groundwater sources to satisfy the demand the risk level could increase from low to high as a result of a reduced precipitation amount a rapid increase in water demand or a combination thereof the severe risk level is the most unsustainable since it means that agricultural water demand cannot be met during the growing season potentially leading to crop failure and that groundwater could severely be depleted 3 1 2 climate scenarios we constructed a climate response surface to identify climate conditions that potentially lead to the identified risk under a specific water demand condition to do this we iteratively run a water resources model section 3 3 using a range of climate scenarios produced by applying change factors to the observed monthly precipitation and temperature values for future climate we derived climate change information from the fifth phase of coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 multi model gcm projections http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 the precipitation change factor was computed from percentage changes in the mean monthly values between cmip5 future projections and historical runs for temperature an additive change factor was estimated two future time slices were considered near term 2021 2050 or 2030s and long term 2071 2100 or 2080s the period 1981 2005 was selected as the baseline because the cmip5 historical runs end in 2005 to account for the decadal variability and reduce the related sampling uncertainty we derived the change factors between the two future 30 year time blocks and the baseline period from all continuous pairs of 20 year blocks drawn from the future periods and the baseline prudhomme et al 2010 then for each month the median of the change factors calculated from each 20 year block average was considered as climate change factor between the future and the baseline in a separate analysis we used data from historical el niño southern oscillation enso years 1950 83 to test if there was a link between global climate variability and the rainfall in the basin and consequently show the impact on the water resource system of the basin specifically we quantified the monthly precipitation deficit during the most recent severe drought and show the level of risk it posed on the water resources system of the basin fourteen years with the strongest enso signal from a 1950 83 period were identified based on the multivariate enso index mei wolter and timlin 2011 averaged over the winter months december february the djf months provide the clearest indication for the strength of the enso events https www esrl noaa gov psd enso past events html accordingly there were 6 el niño and 8 la niña years table 2 while the remaining 20 years were neutral years for the enso years for consistency with the other climate data described above we estimated the mean monthly deviation from the baseline period 1984 2013 note that the el niño years have a wide range of precipitation anomalies in the basin 34 4 to 41 6 annually 4 7 average but the la niña years have mostly dry anomalies 35 4 to 10 7 annually 11 4 average however given the large variation in the precipitation anomalies the enso years may not be used as an indication for the wetness or dryness of the basin 3 2 water demand scenarios to investigate the impact of growing demand on the sustainability of the basin s water resources and how it affects the climate risk we used different water demand scenarios of irrigation and domestic water demand table 3 the industrial water demand and environmental flow requirements were unchanged we considered three scenarios of irrigated areas the first scenario a1 corresponds with the existing crop irrigation mainly consisting of maize 75 and sorghum 24 maina et al 2013 the second irrigation scenario of 100 km2 a2 was based on the estimated potential in the basin but with the same crop composition as the scenario a1 the third scenario a3 also has the same crop composition but a larger area of 250 km2 we considered two scenarios for lodwar population growth rates the first scenario p1 is equal to kenya national average population growth rate 2 7 the second scenario p2 is approximately the same as the estimated population growth rate for turkana county 6 0 considering the recent decentralisation and the associated population growth in the town the p2 scenario is likely a more realistic estimate for the rapidly growing population in the town than the p1 scenario for each scenario domestic water consumption is set at 50 litres per day per capita a value that is consistent with the water poverty index for developing countries gleick 1996 but which is less than the estimated per capita consumption in nairobi otieno 2005 3 3 model and data we used the water evaluation and planning version 21 weap21 model http www weap21 org yates et al 2005 for hydrological process modelling and water allocation see appendix s1 we set up the model for the turkwel river basin with three demand sites lodwar town irrigated agriculture and oil industry a hydropower reservoir and in stream flow requirement fig 2 each demand site is supplied with water from the river and shallow groundwater we assigned the highest demand priority to the in stream environmental flow to match kenya s regulations while all other users have the same lower priority note that the highest demand priority assigned to the environmental flow may not be in practice in the basin e g due to unregulated abstractions upstream however in the current model setup we assume it remains the highest priority similarly it is possible to establish the supply preferences to a given demand site when there are multiple water supply sources however we assume here that there is no supply preference between stream and groundwater we estimated the required environmental flow ef as q95 of the simulated natural mean monthly flow fig s2 the q95 flow estimated at the outlet to lake turkana is 10 m3 s we estimated the water need for each demand site as follows water consumptions in lodwar town and the irrigation water demand scenarios were presented in section 3 2 we set water demand for industry oil production at 10 000 m3 per day a value which reflects the initial phase of oil production but this value could vary depending on the production extent oil exploration began only recently in 2014 and therefore the time period over which production might run is not clear in our analysis we have assumed a uniform industrial demand for all years during the study period 4 results 4 1 impact of recent drought on the base flow in the basin seventy percent of the months during the severe 2014 2016 drought experienced drier conditions

estimated basin average was only 34 25 mm month furthermore a significant proportion of the total rainfall accumulated in march 2017 68 for sc4 and 76 for the basin was recorded over a four day timespan march 25 28 suggesting that the rainfall over the remaining days of the month was exceptionally below normal fig 4b shows the flood flow as a response to the four day rainfall however it quickly receded to a near dry level just one day after the rain stopped fig 4c the quick flow recession is indicative of the significant baseflow reduction during the extreme drought of 2016 17 in the basin this emphasizes the impact of long severe drought on groundwater recharge and its destructive effects on water resources of the basin 4 2 the basin s response to climate variability the climate response surface for the turkwel river basin is shown in fig 5 the response surface estimated based on historical climate 1984 2013 and the conservative a1p1 water demand conditions indicates the combinations of climate conditions that may potentially lead to unsatisfied water demand a higher risk of groundwater depletion or both we represented the range of climate possibilities by increasing or decreasing the monthly precipitation values by a percentage factor ranging from 50 to 50 and warming temperature up to 6 c compared to the baseline the climate response surface shows a severe risk under historical climate conditions i e no change in precipitation and temperature and a conservative water demand scenario this means that the basin has historically been water stressed failing to satisfy demand in one or more growing seasons during the 30 year considered even with high rates of groundwater depletion an increase in precipitation reduces the risk of water scarcity in the basin

3 for all years during the study period in other words if single season march september irrigation is practiced then the agricultural water demand can be fully met a 15 increase in precipitation is estimated to reduce the groundwater abstraction 15 and a 30 increase fully meets the water demand without a significant reduction in groundwater storage conversely reduced precipitation or warming temperature will increase the risk of water scarcity in the basin a decrease in precipitation reduces both the surface water availability and the groundwater recharge while warming temperature increases evapotranspiration which then decreases the available surface water and thereby leads to a higher reliance on groundwater supply it is estimated that a mean monthly precipitation increase of at least 15 30 is required to maintain the medium low risk level without warming temperature the minimum precipitation required to maintain medium low risk levels increases to 20 35 at a 1 5 c warming level which is expected to occur in the 2030s under the rcp8 5 scenario in the basin moss 2008 with a warming by 4 2 c expected to occur in the 2080s in the basin under the rcp8 5 scenario a minimum of 30 45 precipitation increase is needed to reduce the risk level to a medium low level 4 3 impact of climate change and variability the change factors computed from the cmip5 high end rcp8 5

for both the 2030s 2080s and historical 1980 2005 periods the results indicate that significant majority of gcms predict a wetter and a warmer future for the turkwel river basin however studies in east africa have documented that climate models wrongly predict increasing rainfall trends in the coming decades rowell et al 2015 we observed that about one third of the models predict more than 50 precipitation increase for both 2030s and 2080s compared to the baseline they also predict a warmer future with average increases of 1 5 c and 4 2 c for the near term and long term respectively the gcms with relatively better seasonality and trend agreement with the historical climate white marked in fig 5 show similar tendency of wetter and warmer future the risk of the future climate change alone on the water resources of the turkwel river basin is therefore inconclusive and may if taken uncritically as a projection of greater abundance of water resources create the potential for serious maladaptation e g magnan et al 2016 under the conservative a1p1 water demand conditions 43 39 of the gcms indicate a low risk of in 2030s 2080s 11 28 a medium risk 30 17 a high risk and 16 17 of the gcms indicate a severe risk in 2030s 2080s to investigate how the climate variability may impact the water resources of the basin we displayed all the historical years 1950 83 including 6 el niño 8 la niña and 20 neutral years as earlier the enso years show large precipitation variability that ranges between 41 5 and 34 4 compared to the baseline period while the la niña years were on average drier in the basin there was clear indication of la niña leading to positive and el niño to negative precipitation anomalies and vice versa overall half of the 34 years had precipitation deficits that could lead to a severe risk of water scarcity under the a1p1 demand condition the severe risk level means that the water demand was unmet during the growing season and the groundwater abstraction was high seven years 20 resulted in a high risk while 4 years 12 led to a medium risk the low risk level of fully meeting water demand with low level of groundwater dependence was achieved for only 6 18 years indicating that the turkwel river basin has been historically water stressed the finding that the water demand is not fully met during the whole year for the majority of the historical years has an important implication in relation to proposals to move to agriculture with a longer growing season e g sugar cane where water availability is not adequate to satisfy the agricultural needs even during relatively wet years which suggests that it may not be sustainable to invest in large scale projects that requite year long irrigation in the basin unless additional water source is sought in summary while the validity of the wetting trend in the future climate projections remains doubtful the negative impacts of climate variability highlight the extent of water scarcity in the turkwel river basin 4 4 impact of increasing water demand fig 6 presents the shift in climate response surface due to the growing water demand results reveal that expanding irrigated agriculture from 18 km2 a1p1 to 100 km2 a2p1 crop significantly increases the water demand and leads to an increased risk of unsatisfied demand and groundwater depletion the climate risk level rises with a further expansion of irrigated agriculture to 250 km2 a3p1 under historical climate i e no change in precipitation and no warming temperature the total unmet demand increases from 0 1 a1p1 to 8 9 a3p1 of the total demand and groundwater depletion rises from 27 to 61 the amount of precipitation needed to achieve the lowest risk level level 1 with no warming shifts from 30 for the a1p1 to 40 and 50 of the monthly values for the a2p1 and a3p1 scenarios respectively while the population growth also increases the domestic water consumption it does not have as much impact on the risk curve as the irrigation expansion in the basin the risk level of future climate on the water scarcity rises with water demand fig 7 presents the probability of each of the four risk levels as the percentages of the gcms for each of the six water demand scenarios in the 2030s the probability of experiencing severe risk level 4 which includes the combined case of unmet water demand during the growing season and a very high rate of groundwater depletion grows three times from 16 to 49 as a result of the increase in water demand from a1p1 to a3p2 scenarios similarly the probability of the desirable low risk level 1 decreases from 43 to 22 making it much less likely than the severe risk for the highest demand a3p2 scenario we also found a comparable increase of the probability of the severe risk level with growing water demand in 2080s 17 at a1p1 and 44 for a3p2 scenarios 5 discussion 5 1 limited hydroclimatic data the limited hydroclimatic data and the large uncertainty in the future climate projections are two important limitations of applying the climate risk analysis in the turkwel river basin and yet this is a region in which long term investment decisions must be made immediately in the presence of limited information we are therefore explicitly interested in the level of inference that can be sustained based on the information that is available there is limited or no data accessibility on water abstraction from the river or groundwater sources there is an emerging but so far very limited understanding of the groundwater resources in the turkwel basin that requires further investigation addressing these issues is not a trivial task however it requires a great deal of resources and coordination among stakeholders it is of course vital that additional data be collected to support robust decision making in the basin however the likelihood of long lived economic investments being made without access to long records over a wide area is high and we have sought in our analysis to state carefully what inferences can be drawn about the resilience of the water resource system to future climate land use and development related stressors it is of course possible that new data will help increase the precision of the statements that we have felt able to make in the course of this work however unless there appears a new and substantial water supply source e g groundwater supply or inter basin water transfer it is unlikely that new streamflow data will radically alter our assessment of the sustainability of the range of development scenarios being considered 5 2 implications for policy makers our results show that a potential increase in irrigation water demand combined with high rate of population growth aggravates the impacts of drought such as those caused by global climate variability while increased food production could alleviate the food crisis it is also important to consider the additional stress the expanded irrigation puts on the water resources when development projects are planned kvda 2017 there is a recognized link between economic growth and water security in the region brown et al 2011 achieving sustainable economic development can be challenging without an integrated water resources management that includes managing trade offs between irrigation domestic industrial and environmental water demands and defining clear priorities among multiple development projects in the turkwel basin this may involve making decisions pertaining to changing irrigation practices vision 2030 2011vision 2030 2011 and adapting the dam which impounds 41 of the precipitation volume of the basin operation to the downstream water needs in order to release water from the reservoir for the environmental flows and other requirements water resources planning should consider development of groundwater sources this includes fully characterising the napuu aquifer system and its interactions with the turkwel river in order to quantify its sustainable use limits assess its capacity to buffer climate change impacts and to protect it from contamination as it directly underlies a rapidly growing lodwar town the planners also should also consider the errors in the projected rainfall trends in the region climate adaptation and investment planning based on the wrong gcm projections of increasing rainfall trends rowell et al 2015 could lead to a water scarce future the implementation of the existing regulations could be achieved through strengthening the institutional capacity of government agencies and local communities and designing effective water policies that take the local water resources and demand conditions into account to this end evidence based policy decisions will have direct implications on the level of progress towards effective climate risk reduction and mitigation efforts in the basin and other regions with limited data 6 conclusions we assessed the resilience of the data sparse turkwel river basin s water resources system to climate stressors and growing demand by applying the decision scaling climate risk analysis method the results reveal that climate variability and rapidly growing water demand are the main drivers of water scarcity in the basin the frequent occurrence of severe drought due to global climate variability substantially impacted the water availability by reducing runoff and groundwater recharge in addition excessive abstraction to satisfy the water demand due to expanded irrigation and population growth in the basin potentially leads to higher risks of unsatisfied water demand and groundwater depletion the scenario based analysis reveals that a potential increase in crop irrigation from 18 km2 to 250 km2 in the turkwel river basin under historical climate will increase the unmet water demand from 0 1 to 8 9 of the total demand and the loss in groundwater storage from 27 to 61 over the study period 1984 2013 furthermore the probability of experiencing severe risks of unmet water demand and groundwater depletion posed by future climate rises by three times as the result of the potential irrigation expansion taken together our results suggest that policy decisions related to water demand management will have important implications for water scarcity in the basin while every river basin has its unique set of water related challenges the approach used in our analysis can be applied to climate risk analysis of other data sparse river basins around the world conflict of interest none acknowledgments this work is an output from the
