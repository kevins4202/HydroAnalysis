openings and attached structures are introduced with simplified square tubes and corrosion caused degradations are introduced and simplified as perforations three experimental models are employed to study the effects of perforation distribution additionally numerical studies have been performed with nonlinear finite element analysis nfea and results match well with the experimental results based on the measured initial deflections by laser scanning technique collapse shapes have also been compared and analyzed and influences of different types of initial deflections and boundary conditions on ultimate strength have been investigated the results shown in this paper can be helpful for understanding the mechanism of structural collapse and provide reference for the ultimate strength experimental designs of such structures keywords stiffened plates with openings experiments ultimate strength collapse mechanism perforation 1 introduction commercial cargo ships such as container ships oil tankers and bulk carriers are widely used currently and their structural strengths have always been the concern of ship designers and owners the ultimate strength of hull girder is strongly related to the strength of local structures such as determination of the local structural modelling extent boundary conditions and external loads etc the hull girder ultimate strength has been extensively investigated in recent years e g tanaka et al 2015 proposed an analysis method of ultimate hull girder strength under combined bending and torsion where the hull girder was modelled by a series of thin walled linear beam elements composed of plate and stiffened panel elements and finally the effectiveness of the proposed method was discussed comparing with the results of experiments and fem analysis xu et al 2017 discussed the reliable and suitable fe modelling in explicit dynamic method which could keep the balance of the acceptable accurate results and computation resources and several influential factors on the collapse behaviors of hull girder are discussed including boundary conditions geometric ranges of finite element model element types loading methods and loading time alie and adiputra 2018 investigated the ship hull girder strength as a result of grounding damage upon longitudinal bending where a bulk carrier and tanker are analyzed and smith s method was adopted li et al 2018 investigated the variation of neutral axis of ship hull girder due to asymmetric geometry or asymmetric load and its influence on the ultimate strength of hull girder van et al 2018 studied the effect of initial imperfections and corrosion wastage on the age related strength degradation of bulk carriers wang et al 2018 investigated the ultimate limit states of an ultra large container ship under combined vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsional moment and derived a typical three dimensional envelope with good accuracy wang and wang 2018 proposed similarity criterion in small scale model experiments considering the effects of initial deflections which can guarantee the similarity in both elastic and inelastic range during the progressive collapse of plates stiffened panels and hull girder and numerical validation has been made and the proposed design methods were validated through model experiment that followed wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b also extended the similarity design to combined bending and torsional similarities and two experimental setups representing bending and torsion model tests are introduced and studied numerically showing that the scale model designed by the proposed similarity theory is quite stable wang et al 2020 then proved the similarity theories through torsional ultimate strength model experiment with detailed collapse behavior analysis as a type of primary member longitudinal girders are subjected to compression in hogging conditions additionally there are openings lying in the longitudinal girders so it is necessary to investigate this special kind of structures in terms of ultimate strength generally the ultimate strength in typical stiffened panels is a major concern e g fujikubo and yao 1999 studied the elastic buckling strength by introducing torsional rigidity to simulate the interaction between stiffener and plate and they also studied the influences of welding residual stress on the buckling strength fujikubo et al 2005a fujikubo et al 2005b made an extensive study on the ultimate strength of continuous plates and continuous stiffened panels under combined transverse thrust and lateral pressure tanaka et al 2014 studied 720 cases with different numbers types and sizes of stiffeners by nfea and compared the results with predictions by several existing methods such as csr puls and fyh and concluded that the puls and fyh method can give good estimations considering structural openings arino and frechin 2006 studied the ultimate strength of orthotropic plate with a central hole under uniaxial tension both numerically and analytically and compared the results with experimental results kumar et al 2009 have studied the behavior of stiffened steel plates with openings up to collapse and the post peak behavior under axial and out of plane loads wang et al 2009 investigated both buckling strength eigenvalues and ultimate strength of main supporting members with openings where parametric studies were conducted such as slenderness ratio and aspect ratio of panels shape and dimensions of openings longitudinal and transverse compressive stresses and shear stress and finally simplified formulae were proposed based on the fem results melcher and karmazinova 2011 have studied the lateral flexural torsional buckling of steel beams with web holes yu and lee 2012 have studied the behavior of unstiffened plate with rectangular opening including influences of opening sizes locations plate slenderness ratio and etc saad eldeen et al 2013 performed the ultimate strength analysis of steel plates with a large opening subjected to axial compressive load saad eldeen et al 2016a have investigated the residual structural capacity of experimentally tested steel plates with a large central ellipsoidal opening with and without locked cracks subjected to uni axial compressive load and experimental results of the tested specimens have been compared with other test results for plates with different opening sizes confirming the significance of the combined effect of an opening with simultaneous locked cracks on the local and global structural behavior saad eldeen et al 2016c have investigated the ultimate strength of experimentally tested steel plates with a large central elongated circular opening subjected to uni axial compressive load saad eldeen et al 2016b have studied the combined effect of both geometrical characteristics opening and initial imperfections and age related damage corrosion and cracks on the local and global responses of thin rectangular steel plates and a series of experimental tests has been conducted for in service steel plates with a circular opening and subjected to several damage actions and uni axial compression saad eldeen et al 2017 have investigated the compressive load carrying capability of experimentally tested reinforced steel panels with a large lightning opening from the viewpoint of ship s life cycles corrosion induced damages can be a significant source of structural strength degradation thus reasonable measures should be taken which should be based on preliminary structural analyses considering the damage effects corrosion is a very complicated phenomenon and many researchers have devoted in developing corrosion growth models regarding to available statistics e g some researchers supposed corrosion follows a linear relationship with time guedes soares and garbatov 1996 sun and bai 2003 wirsching et al 1997 melchers 1999 extended southwell bultman hummer s linear and bilinear model southwell et al 1979 and introduced second statistical moment guedes soares and garbatov 1999 proposed a nonlinear corrosion model which indicates that corrosion doesn t take place within the life of coating materials taking corrosion into consideration paik et al 2004 investigated the ultimate strength characteristics of steel plate elements with pit corrosion wastage and under in plane shear loads and derived corresponding closed form ultimate strength design formulas wang et al 2015 studied the behavior of steel stiffened plates subjected to weld induced grooving corrosion using nfea and concludes that grooving corrosion can cause a significant reduction in ultimate strength cui et al 2017 investigated the ultimate strength behaviors of both container ship hull girders and stiffened panels under corrosion on one hand the ultimate strength of container ship hull girder subject to combined moments of bending and torsion is studied and the limit state of failure is derived and the probabilistic characteristics under uniform corrosions are studied for the cases of pure bending pure torsion and combination of both on the other hand the ultimate strength of bottom stiffened panel under longitudinal thrust is studied considering effects of key factors such as initial deflection element sizes simplified boundary conditions and lateral seawater pressure etc and the corresponding ultimate strength probabilistic characteristics and its dependency on correlation between different structures corrosion are studied for simplicity while maintaining the main effects of corrosion uniform corrosion and associated degradation on structural strengths have been investigated in this paper while the time variant characteristics have not been considered cui et al 2016a cui et al 2016b and cui et al 2019 have also investigated the ultimate strengths under different patterns of corrosion and probabilistic characteristics has also been studied which shows that the corrosion patterns and corrosion distributions can be a major factor both for ultimate strength evaluations the authors have also investigated the ultimate strength of typical longitudinal girders under uniaxial compression and influential factors such as boundary conditions and initial deflections cui and wang 2018 based on experimental tests with relevant nonlinear finite element analysis nfea this paper focuses on the ultimate strength of typical stiffened plates with openings under uniaxial compression on one hand experiments have been performed to study the ultimate strength of stiffened plates with openings as well as the collapse behavior where corrosion induced damages are simulated by perforations on the other hand the nfeas are also carried out for comparison and the mechanism of collapse are analyzed and influential factors such as initial deflections and boundary conditions are investigated due to similarities in ships the above investigations are valuable to design of other similar structures and provide reference for such kind of ultimate strength experimental designs 2 experimental set up 2 1 structural model description longitudinal girders are under axial compression in hull girder hogging bending conditions which is of crucial importance to the ship s strength evaluation however the longitudinal girders may be accompanied with openings for practical purposes which causes structural degradation and thus the related structural strength should be investigated particularly the purpose of this study to investigate the ultimate strength behavior of stiffened plates with central opening under uniaxial compression where effects of pitting corrosion are also included to reflect the practical situation ships encounter in their life cycles to facilitate experimental test under current laboratory conditions the geometric scantlings of practical structures have been scaled appropriately meanwhile considering the difficulty in complicated setups to accurately simulate typical boundary conditions in laboratory simplifications were adopted in the model tests i e the boundary conditions were achieved by adoption of longitudinal girder transverse frame type of structures strong square tubes bars alongside the structures in this experiment which can reduce the complexity in boundary condition setups in this paper we have concerned the ultimate strength and structural failure behavior mechanism of stiffened plates with openings whereas the similarity between test models and practical structures is not emphasized it should be noted that the objective of the current experiment is to investigate the collapse behavior of opened structures with pitting corrosion taken into consideration so the similarity of the experimental structures and the actual structures is not taken as mandatory requirements in the experimental design while slenderness ratios show they are quite similar strictly speaking the distribution of pitting corrosion is random in nature however considering the experimental restrictions simplifications must be made in the model test thus two different but representative types of pitting corrosion distribution have been adopted i e the regular and random pitting distribution in the plating while the similar corrosion volume is controlled for comparison reasons in the experimental design three models were designed for the experiments which can be denoted as m1 m2 and m3 m1 represents the model of opened structures without pitting corrosion and the detailed structural scantlings are as shown in fig 1 unit in mm where 46 strain gauges were used to measure the strain in the load direction as shown in the figure stain gauge 43 and 45 were set on middle of stiffener web plating while 44 and 46 were set on stiffener flange m2 represents the model with uniformly distributed pitting corrosion as shown in fig 2 where 47 stain gauges were used stain gauge 44 and 46 were set on middle of stiffener web plating while 45 and 47 were set on stiffener flange and pitting corrosion is modelled as perforated circular holes with diameters of 15 mm for easier manufacturing of the structural model m3 represents the model with non uniformly distributed pitting corrosion as shown in fig 3 where 48 strain gauges were used e g strain gauges 1 3 were set on top side and bottom of square tubes respectively stain gauge 47 and 49 were set on middle of stiffener web plating while 48 and 50 were set on stiffener flange the strain gauges were set at key locations throughout the whole structures which can give clearer understanding of the structural failure pattern and process e g they are set at the predicted largest stress areas perforation and opening areas meanwhile displacement gauges were also used to measure the out of plane displacements of critical points as shown in above figures where up and down means displacement gauges are set at the up and down side of the structures respectively and measured results are positive for compression while the structures were set with stiffener side downwards as mentioned before square tubes were set along the boundaries both in longitudinal and transverse directions which can be regarded as simplified boundary conditions for the stiffened plates in this paper the uniaxial compression was applied on the thick square tubes at the longitudinal ends to investigate the ultimate strength the material in the experiment is steel q235 used in shipbuilding i e the yield strength is no less than 235 mpa a summary of the structural dimensions is shown in table 1 where the slenderness ratios are calculated by the following equations and where r is the radius of gyration r i a i and a are the sectional modulus and area of the stiffened plate we can find that the slenderness ratios lie within the ranges of practical ship structures i e β values are usually between 1 0 and 2 5 while λ values are between 0 05 and 1 0 as investigated by zhang 2016 based on real ships so similarity between them are acceptable 1 β b t p σ y e λ a π r σ y e in practical ship structures the diameter of pits lies within 25 80 mm as demonstrated by paik et al 2004 thus the diameter of pits was chosen to be 15 mm throughout the paper considering the dimension reduced experimental model comparing with practical ones to guarantee the mesh quality and represent the curvature features more than 10 mesh seeds were applied on circular boundaries meanwhile measures such as aspect ratio checking have been taken to guarantee mesh quality for easier manufacturing of the experimental model perforation like pitting corrosion was adopted as the limit of pitting corrosion in this study according to previous investigations the structural residual ultimate strength almost follows linear relationships with depth of normally distributed pitting corrosion so adoption of perforation like corrosion is reasonable for explanation of the structural collapse behaviors 2 2 experimental layout and testing system according to the previously mentioned experimental test design the experimental layout is shown in fig 4 where the compressive loads by loading system was transferred to the experimental models by adopting box shaped strong structures which can guarantee the uniform loading and avoid the possible stress concentration otherwise meanwhile the out of plane displacements were also constrained at the loading edges the longitudinal supporting structures are almost fully restrained at the ends by the strong structures connected and experimental facilities including the out of plane deformations the rotations of plating and stiffener webs on the other hand can be regarded as partially constrained additionally the strain gauges and displacement measurement gauges have been adopted to test the local strain distributions and overall displacements at specific structural locations of interest 3 nonlinear finite element analysis nonlinear finite element analysis nfea is a unified method in ultimate strength analysis for various kinds of engineering structures especially the complicated ones and has found wide applications with the rapid development of computers according to tanaka et al 2014 and discussions by xu et al 2013 the analysis models for continuous general stiffened plates can be divided into four kinds according to modelling scope in each direction along longitudinal girder and transverse frame i e the 1 2 1 2 span 1 2 1 2 bay 1 2 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 bay 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 2 bay and 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 bay models however we should note that above models can only be applied to multi bay and multi span continuous intact structures without openings especially off center openings or corrosion considering the special case of longitudinal girder like structures in this paper due to existence of asymmetric factors such as corrosion above models cannot be applied instead we select the one span one bay model which can well reflect the practical structural characteristics as shown in fig 7 which is in accordance with previous model settings in the models x y and z denote transverse vertical and longitudinal directions respectively simply supported boundary conditions are assigned on longitudinal ends which are also assumed to remain straight i e uniform normal displacements and also the boundaries are allowed to be pulled in freely as illustrated by tanaka et al 2014 stiffeners at the ends are kept perpendicular with the panel surface during the whole loading process while the rotation along stiffener web perpendicular axis is set free which can also be regarded as simply supported denote u v and w as the translational displacements in x y and z directions respectively and θ x θ y and θ z as the rotational displacements in x y and z directions respectively the boundary conditions are as follows 2 u a b u c d 0 θ x a b θ x c d θ z a b θ z c d 0 w a b u n i f o r m w c d u n i f o r m note that simply supported boundary conditions ignore the rotational rigidity along boundary axes for comparison the clamped boundary conditions are also investigated however we should explain that no boundary conditions are perfect due to the simplification and idealization process so comparison between different boundary conditions are meaningful which indicates the gap where actual situations lie within additionally we have also investigated the influences of initial deflections on the ultimate strengths of such structures firstly the true initial deflections are measured using a lasing scanning technique as shown in fig 5 reconstructing the geometric surface of the experimental test model by aid of distributed datum points the measured initial deflections for above three experimental models are shown in fig 6 in units of meters which is further processed for the relevant nfeas we can find that the initial deflections of models 1 and 2 are similar while that of model 3 is different statistics of the measured initial deflection has been summarized in table 2 with comparison of typical idealized initial deflection magnitudes as will be shown in the following parts for comparison the typical initial deflection types such as thin horse recommended by ueda and yao 1985 as well as the buckling mode type initial deflection based on eigenvalue and eigenvector solutions of buckling are adopted the residual stresses are not considered in this paper generally three types of initial deflections exist in practical structures i e the global mode of stiffened panels local mode of plates and tripping mode of stiffeners respective expressions are shown as follows with the coordinate system and displacements as defined before a local mode of plates the thin horse initial deflection is shown below where the detailed coefficients are according to ueda and yao 1985 as shown in table 3 3 u o p l k 1 11 a 0 k sin k π z a sin π y b where a denotes span between adjacent transverse frames and b denotes spacing between adjacent longitudinal stiffeners a 0 denotes the magnitude of the above initial deflection and is recommended as 0 1 β 2 t p where β b t p σ y e is the slenderness ratio t p plate thickness σ y material yield stress e young s modulus we should note that the above introduced buckling mode initial deflections correspond to intact structures without openings which is different from the buckling modes of structures with openings however we still adopted this type of initial deflection based on hypothesis that the initial deflections already exist before openings are made as well as considerations of structural continuity on different sides along stiffeners also as will be shown later we note that buckling in the plating on two sides plays a more important role in the progressive collapse of longitudinal girder since the buckling in plating with openings corresponds to higher order buckling modes different from the governing buckling mode of the stiffened panel which results in limited contribution combined with reduced sectional area this hypothesis that initial deflections already exist before openings are cut out has also been adopted in the case of thin horse initial deflections b global mode of stiffened panels 4 u o c b 0 sin π z a sin π y b where b denotes the double bottom height in this case and b 0 denotes the magnitude of the column type mode and is recommended as 0 0015a c tripping distortion of stiffeners 5 v o s c 0 x h w sin π z a where h w denotes the height of the stiffener and c 0 denotes the magnitude of the stiffener tripping mode and is recommended as 0 0015a 4 results and discussion firstly the uniaxial tensile test of specimen has been carried out to get the engineering stress strain curves then the true stress strain curve accounting for the sectional area change should be derived according to the following equations from which we can infer the true strain is smaller than engineering strain while true stress is larger the testing system and obtained testing results are shown in fig 8 which should be used to model the materials in numerical analysis 6 ε t r u e ln 1 ε e n g σ t r u e σ e n g 1 ε e n g 4 1 experimental results to capture the out of plane displacements at particular points of the structures 3 displacement gauges are set for model 1 4 are set for model 2 3 are set for model 3 as shown in figs 1 3 this can help understanding the structural collapse behaviors in the whole experimental processes the ultimate strength results of above three models are shown in fig 9 however we should note that the displacement includes the rigid body movements of the whole structure due to movements of connected structures so the displacement does not coincide with the one in load end shortening curves so the structural modulus derived from the force displacement curves is smaller than fem results thus only the captured ultimate strength value is used which is also the main interest by observing the displacement gauge and strain gauge results it is evident that for all 3 models the displacements grow rapidly as external load approaches ultimate load capacity and continue to grow beyond ultimate strengths we can find that due to existence of opening the compressive strains near the opening is substantially smaller than that near ends the strain distributions are not uniform along longitudinal direction in side square tubes and the strains in the same cross section are different either for top side and bottom locations indicating out of plane deformations or bending of the tubes in loading process which results from buckling and collapse of side plating due to the column type bending of stiffeners to the stiffener side the strain in stiffener web is larger than in stiffener flange and the strains are different along longitudinal direction the measured results are in accordance with the collapse shape as described in fig 21 and it is evident that not only the ultimate strengths but also the collapse shapes are different when considering different types of corrosion detailed differences regarding to above 3 experimental models are discussed more extensively in the following sections 4 1 1 results of model m1 as shown in fig 9 a the ultimate strength obtained by model test is 681 kn at the displacement of loading end about 5 mm the displacements by displacement gauges at measured locations are shown in fig 10 positive for compression in gauges from which downwards displacements are observed for opening edge and stiffener at measured points while upwards displacements are observed for middle of side plating which can be explained by the collapse development as shown in fig 21 turning point is observed in gauge 3 which is caused by the influence of column type bending downwards in collapse process the measured strains are shown in fig 11 figure b shows that the opening edge near stiffeners bear larger loads than side plating which even result in longitudinal tension after collapse buckling induced out of plane deformation and thus relaxation in bearing capacity figure c shows similar results as figure b but longitudinal compression is observed in all the positions indicating smaller out of plane deformations therein figure d shows similar results as figure b figure h shows that the symmetry between side square tubes only exists in the linear stage i e it cannot be guaranteed when applied loads approach ultimate strength 4 1 2 results of model m2 as shown in fig 9 b the ultimate strength obtained by model test is 675 kn at the displacement of loading end about 5 2 mm the displacements by displacement gauges at measured locations are shown in fig 12 positive for compression in gauges from which we can find downwards displacements for all the measured points which can be explained by the collapse development as shown in fig 21 turning points are observed in gauge 3 and 4 which is due to the effects caused by upwards bending of side square tubes the measured strains are shown in fig 13 figure b shows that stress and strain redistributes due to perforation and the maximum strain locates between perforations in side plating rather than near stiffeners or side tubes figure c shows that the maximum strains of the intact section locate along stiffeners different from figure b due to the offset from perforation as well as center opening along longitudinal direction figure d shows similar results as figure c although the measure points locate at the perforation along longitudinal direction figure h shows that the relatively weak symmetry between side square tubes only exists in the linear stage and the differences may lie within the initial deflection asymmetry 4 1 3 results of model m3 as shown in fig 9 c the ultimate strength obtained by model test is 625 kn at the displacement of loading end about 5 5 mm the displacements by displacement gauges at measured locations are shown in fig 14 positive for compression in gauges from which we can find downwards displacements for middle of side plating opening edge and stiffener at measured points which can be explained by the collapse development as shown in fig 21 no turning point in gauges has been observed as previous models because serious downwards bending is observed in the side square tubes the measured strains are shown in fig 15 from figure a asymmetry of strains are observed due to the irregular distribution of perforations the data from gauge no 31 is removed due to functional error figure b shows that the opening edge near stiffeners bear larger loads than side plating and asymmetry of strains are observed due to irregular distribution of perforations from figures c h asymmetry between tubes on both sides is observed that non simultaneous bending lies therein resulting in different residual deformation after collapse considering the equivalent corrosion volume with previous corroded model the ultimate strength of model 3 is lower than expected comparing with the nfea results as shown in fig 9 and also comparing with model 2 experimental results one possible reason should be the differences in deformation of side square tubes as shown in fig 16 i e the bending upwards cases result in relatively larger ultimate strengths than the bending downwards cases thus the deformation of side tubes including the initial deflections are very important for these kind of structures and special attention should be paid to the design and relevant measurements in the ultimate strength problems using this type of models 4 2 numerical simulation results by nfeas on the other hand we have carried out the numerical simulations according to corresponding nfeas based on commercial software abaqus to provide validation of applying nfeas in these kinds of structural analyses and to investigate the collapse modes between the numerical models and experimental models 4 2 1 finite element modelling according to the modelling details as mentioned before the finite element models of the three experimental models are shown in fig 17 where fine mesh is applied throughout the structures 4 2 2 finite element analysis results before performing the collapse analysis by carrying out nfeas the elastic buckling characteristics have been analyzed and the first 4 buckling modes have been shown in fig 18 where the eigenvalues are the buckling strength under uniaxial compression in units of mpa we can find that the out of plane deformations at center plating where opening locates are very small in the lower buckling modes compared with the other plating on the side due to the existence of free boundary conditions at the opening additionally the buckling modes are not completely symmetric which can be explained by the adoption of angle bar stiffeners induced asymmetry of the whole structures by using the measured initial deflections as previous shown in fig 6 the ultimate strength of the three models has been analyzed by using nfeas and the results are shown in fig 9 the calculated ultimate strengths for three models are 708 kn 664 kn and 666 kn respectively we can find that the ultimate strengths correspond to errors of 3 9 1 6 and 6 5 by comparison with experiments so the results can be acceptable using the nfeas considering the inevitable uncertainties in experimental tests i e the numerical methods by using nfeas are reasonable and can be served as an alternative for ultimate strength evaluations the stress distributions at ultimate strength are shown in fig 20 from figure a we can find that the middle plating enters plasticity only at opening area while the other area remain elastic due to existence of opening and also the middle parts of the sides plating starts to deform out of plane causing local tension and hence unloading of the whole structure in the cases with perforations however the plastic regions reduce substantially and the maximum compressive stresses concentrate at the regions with minimum sectional area the displacements are converted to the measurements by gauges in the experiment for clearer comparison as shown in fig 19 we can find that the displacements match well with that from experiments as explained earlier same phenomenon is observed for gauge no 3 in model 1 which changes signs after ultimate strength and similarly this can be explained by the collapse process where column type collapse propagates and half wave lengths change as to the out of plane deformations the maximum ones locate at the center opening area in middle plating for model 1 but at the perforation area in side plating within longitudinal opening extent for models 2 and 3 corresponding to minimum sectional areas additionally the half wave peaks are sharper for the corroded models at ultimate strength and the half wave lengths therein tend to be smaller than the intact case which can be explained by the degraded structural rigidity caused by corrosion the collapse shapes are shown in fig 21 and we can find very good matches between experimental and numerical results we have also investigated the stress distributions along transverse directions at longitudinal ends as shown in fig 22 we can find that the distributions remain symmetric for the models 1 and 2 due to the symmetry of both structures and corrosion while asymmetry is observed for the irregular corrosion case in model 3 one common phenomenon is observed that the middle plating area shows smaller capacity due to the opening corresponding to the minimum compressive stresses therein while maximum axial stresses locate at the sides based on both experimental and numerical results we have also noted an interesting phenomenon that the side square tubes always deform the same direction of the neighboring side plating i e the collapse shape of side plating directly influences the deformation of side square tubes and vice versa thus the interaction between them should be carefully investigated in design of such kind of experiments 4 2 3 influences of initial deflection types and boundary conditions initial deflections can be an important factor for ultimate strength analysis so we have also investigated the types of initial deflection besides the measured ones including the thin horse type and the buckling type obtained by eigenvalue analysis as mentioned before for clear comparison the same magnitudes are chosen to investigate the influences of different initial deflection types and the magnitude is selected the same as the thin horse type as defined before simply supported boundary conditions have been applied and the results are shown in fig 23 where experiment denotes the test results and fe idexp denotes the fe results based on measured initial deflection in model test and th denotes thin horse type initial deflection and bkl denotes buckling mode initial deflection and bkl 1 6 denotes the initial deflection by combination of first 6 order buckling modes from the figure we can find that the ultimate strength under thin horse type initial deflection almost gives the largest ultimate strength values while the minimum ones correspond not necessarily to the lower order buckling modes type initial deflections which may be due to the complexity lying within not only the structure itself but also the introduced pitting corrosion the force displacement curves by fem are shown in fig 24 for model 1 as an example exp denotes the measured initial deflection and we can find small differences in stiffness and ultimate strength between them with same magnitude e g the maximum difference is below 5 except the experimental results of model 3 by comparing the collapse between different types of initial deflections we can find that the stiffener tripping is very important in the ultimate strength of these kinds of structures i e serious stiffener tripping is observed in the cases of minimum ultimate strengths as shown in fig 25 as we have mentioned before the boundary conditions at the longitudinal ends are partially restrained so the boundary conditions should lie within the simply supported and the clamped ones so we have investigated the effects of boundary conditions and the results are shown in fig 26 the ultimate strengths obtained by nfeas are 711 7 kn 666 6 kn and 667 0 kn respectively for models 1 to 3 we can find that the differences are negligible compared with simply supported boundary conditions with maximum difference of 0 64 5 conclusions this paper focuses on the compressive ultimate strength of typical stiffened plates with openings subjected to perforation type corrosion and both experiments and numerical analyses are carried out it shows that both the ultimate strength values and collapse modes match well for the experiments and nfeas maximum difference of ultimate strength 6 5 the current design of experimental models can release the complicated setting of boundary conditions which is meaningful for similar types of structural experiments including both destructive and non destructive ones above structures show common characteristics of ultimate strength e g the collapse starts at the opening section with minimum residual sectional area which also corresponds to maximum out of plane deformation within the extent of center opening the half waves in corroded structures are sharper with smaller longitudinal half wave length additionally the following conclusions can also be drawn 1 deformations of side supporting structures are important for the ultimate strength and collapse analysis and they are influenced by collapse shape of side plating thus special attention should be paid to their interaction in these types of structural models including initial deflection effects 2 within the extent of opening strain distributions show relaxation in longitudinal compression near opening area along center line and maximum compression regions are near stiffeners or girders for intact structures but may transfer to middle of plating under different patterns of corrosion at longitudinal ends due to the opening maximum axial stresses strains locate at the sides 3 column type out of plane deformation accompanied with tripping deformation is observed for stiffeners in above three models to the stiffener side combined with same direction of deformations in side square tubes the ultimate strength can be substantially lower than expected model 3 4 the ultimate strengths are sensitive to initial deflections and thin horse modes result in larger ultimate strengths under same magnitudes of buckling type initial deflection the minimum ultimate strength does not necessarily correspond to the lower order modes thus the initial deflection should be carefully selected in the structural design and evaluations 5 even under same volume of corrosion both the structural ultimate strength and collapse may deviate substantially considering different types of corrosion especially within the extent of

li et al 2018 investigated the variation of neutral axis of ship hull girder due to asymmetric geometry or asymmetric load and its influence on the ultimate strength of hull girder van et al 2018 studied the effect of initial imperfections and corrosion wastage on the age related strength degradation of bulk carriers wang et al 2018 investigated the ultimate limit states of an ultra large container ship under combined vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsional moment and derived a typical three dimensional envelope with good accuracy wang and wang 2018 proposed similarity criterion in small scale model experiments considering the effects of initial deflections which can guarantee the similarity in both elastic and inelastic range during the progressive collapse of plates stiffened panels and hull girder and numerical validation has been made and the proposed design methods were validated through model experiment that followed wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b also extended the similarity design to combined bending and torsional similarities and two experimental setups representing bending and torsion model tests are introduced and studied numerically showing that the scale model designed by the proposed similarity theory is quite stable wang et al 2020 then proved the similarity theories through torsional ultimate strength model experiment with detailed collapse behavior analysis as a type of primary member longitudinal girders are subjected to compression in hogging conditions additionally there are openings lying in the longitudinal girders so it is necessary to investigate this special kind of structures in terms of ultimate strength generally the ultimate strength in typical stiffened panels is a major concern e g fujikubo and yao 1999 studied the elastic buckling strength by introducing torsional rigidity to simulate the interaction between stiffener and plate and they also studied the influences of welding residual stress on the buckling strength fujikubo et al 2005a fujikubo et al 2005b made an extensive study on the ultimate strength of continuous plates and continuous stiffened panels under combined transverse thrust and lateral pressure tanaka et al 2014 studied 720 cases with different numbers types and sizes of stiffeners by nfea and compared the results with predictions by several existing methods such as csr puls and fyh and concluded that the puls and fyh method can give good estimations considering structural openings arino and frechin 2006 studied the ultimate strength of orthotropic plate with a central hole under uniaxial tension both numerically and analytically and compared the results with experimental results kumar et al 2009 have studied the behavior of stiffened steel plates with openings up to collapse and the post peak behavior under axial and out of plane loads wang et al 2009 investigated both buckling strength eigenvalues and ultimate strength of main supporting members with openings where parametric studies were conducted such as slenderness ratio and aspect ratio of panels shape and dimensions of openings longitudinal and transverse compressive stresses and shear stress and finally simplified formulae were proposed based on the fem results melcher and karmazinova 2011 have studied the lateral flexural torsional buckling of steel beams with web holes yu and lee 2012 have studied the behavior of unstiffened plate with rectangular opening including influences of opening sizes locations plate slenderness ratio and etc saad eldeen et al 2013 performed the ultimate strength analysis of steel plates with a large opening subjected to axial compressive load saad eldeen et al 2016a have investigated the residual structural capacity of experimentally tested steel plates with a large central ellipsoidal opening with and without locked cracks subjected to uni axial compressive load and experimental results of the tested specimens have been compared with other test results for plates with different opening sizes confirming the significance of the combined effect of an opening with simultaneous locked cracks on the local and global structural behavior saad eldeen et al 2016c have investigated the ultimate strength of experimentally tested steel plates with a large central elongated circular opening subjected to uni axial compressive load saad eldeen et al 2016b have studied the combined effect of both geometrical characteristics opening and initial imperfections and age related damage corrosion and cracks on the local and global responses of thin rectangular steel plates and a series of experimental tests has been conducted for in service steel plates with a circular opening and subjected to several damage actions and uni axial compression saad eldeen et al 2017 have investigated the compressive load carrying capability of experimentally tested reinforced steel panels with a large lightning opening from the viewpoint of ship s life cycles corrosion induced damages can be a significant source of structural strength degradation thus reasonable measures should be taken which should be based on preliminary structural analyses considering the damage effects corrosion is a very complicated phenomenon and many researchers have devoted in developing corrosion growth models regarding to available statistics e g some researchers supposed corrosion follows a linear relationship with time guedes soares and garbatov 1996 sun and bai 2003 wirsching et al 1997 melchers 1999 extended southwell bultman hummer s linear and bilinear model southwell et al 1979 and introduced second statistical moment guedes soares and garbatov 1999 proposed a nonlinear corrosion model which indicates that corrosion doesn t take place within the life of coating materials taking corrosion into consideration paik et al 2004 investigated the ultimate strength characteristics of steel plate elements with pit corrosion wastage and under in plane shear loads and derived corresponding closed form ultimate strength design formulas wang et al 2015 studied the behavior of steel stiffened plates subjected to weld induced grooving corrosion using nfea and concludes that grooving corrosion can cause a significant reduction in ultimate strength cui et al 2017 investigated the ultimate strength behaviors of both container ship hull girders and stiffened panels under corrosion on one hand the ultimate strength of container ship hull girder subject to combined moments of bending and torsion is studied and the limit state of failure is derived and the probabilistic characteristics under uniform corrosions are studied for the cases of pure bending pure torsion and combination of both on the other hand the ultimate strength of bottom stiffened panel under longitudinal thrust is studied considering effects of key factors such as initial deflection element sizes simplified boundary conditions and lateral seawater pressure etc and the corresponding ultimate strength probabilistic characteristics and its dependency on correlation between different structures corrosion are studied for simplicity while maintaining the main effects of corrosion uniform corrosion and associated degradation on structural strengths have been investigated in this paper while the time variant characteristics have not been considered cui et al 2016a cui et al 2016b and cui et al 2019 have also investigated the ultimate strengths under different patterns of corrosion and probabilistic characteristics has also been studied which shows that the corrosion patterns and corrosion distributions can be a major factor both for ultimate strength evaluations the authors have also investigated the ultimate strength of typical longitudinal girders under uniaxial compression and influential factors such as boundary conditions and initial deflections cui and wang 2018 based on experimental tests with relevant nonlinear finite element analysis nfea this paper focuses on the ultimate strength of typical stiffened plates with openings under uniaxial compression on one hand experiments have been performed to study the ultimate strength of stiffened plates with openings as well as the collapse behavior where corrosion induced damages are simulated by perforations on the other hand the nfeas are also carried out for comparison and the mechanism of collapse are analyzed and influential factors such as initial deflections and boundary conditions are investigated due to similarities in ships the above investigations are valuable to design of other similar structures and provide reference for such kind of ultimate strength experimental designs 2 experimental set up 2 1 structural model description longitudinal girders are under axial compression in hull girder hogging bending conditions which is of crucial importance to the ship s strength evaluation however the longitudinal girders may be accompanied with openings for practical purposes which causes structural degradation and thus the related structural strength should be investigated particularly the purpose of this study to investigate the ultimate strength behavior of stiffened plates with central opening under uniaxial compression where effects of pitting corrosion are also included to reflect the practical situation ships encounter in their life cycles to facilitate experimental test under current laboratory conditions the geometric scantlings of practical structures have been scaled appropriately meanwhile considering the difficulty in complicated setups to accurately simulate typical boundary conditions in laboratory simplifications were adopted in the model tests i e the boundary conditions were achieved by adoption of longitudinal girder transverse frame type of structures strong square tubes bars alongside the structures in this experiment which can reduce the complexity in boundary condition setups in this paper we have concerned the ultimate strength and structural failure behavior mechanism of stiffened plates with openings whereas the similarity between test models and practical structures is not emphasized it should be noted that the objective of the current experiment is to investigate the collapse behavior of opened structures with pitting corrosion taken into consideration so the similarity of the experimental structures and the actual structures is not taken as mandatory requirements in the experimental design while slenderness ratios show they are quite similar strictly speaking the distribution of pitting corrosion is random in nature however considering the experimental restrictions simplifications must be made in the model test thus two different but representative types of pitting corrosion distribution have been adopted i e the regular and random pitting distribution in the plating while the similar corrosion volume is controlled for comparison reasons in the experimental design three models were designed for the experiments which can be denoted as m1 m2 and m3 m1 represents the model of opened structures without pitting corrosion and the detailed structural scantlings are as shown in fig 1 unit in mm where 46 strain gauges were used to measure the strain in the load direction as shown in the figure stain gauge 43 and 45 were set on middle of stiffener web plating while 44 and 46 were set on stiffener flange m2 represents the model with uniformly distributed pitting corrosion as shown in fig 2 where 47 stain gauges were used stain gauge 44 and 46 were set on middle of stiffener web plating while 45 and 47 were set on stiffener flange and pitting corrosion is modelled as perforated circular holes with diameters of 15 mm for easier manufacturing of the structural model m3 represents the model with non uniformly distributed pitting corrosion as shown in fig 3 where 48 strain gauges were used e g strain gauges 1 3 were set on top side and bottom of square tubes respectively stain gauge 47 and 49 were set on middle of stiffener web plating while 48 and 50 were set on stiffener flange the strain gauges were set at key locations throughout the whole structures which can give clearer understanding of the structural failure pattern and process e g they are set at the predicted largest stress areas perforation and opening areas meanwhile displacement gauges were also used to measure the out of plane displacements of critical points as shown in above figures where up and down means displacement gauges are set at the up and down side of the structures respectively and measured results are positive for compression while the structures were set with stiffener side downwards as mentioned before square tubes were set along the boundaries both in longitudinal and transverse directions which can be regarded as simplified boundary conditions for the stiffened plates in this paper the uniaxial compression was applied on the thick square tubes at the longitudinal ends to investigate the ultimate strength the material in the experiment is steel q235 used in shipbuilding i e the yield strength is no less than 235 mpa a summary of the structural dimensions is shown in table 1 where the slenderness ratios are calculated by the following equations and where r is the radius of gyration r i a i and a are the sectional modulus and area of the stiffened plate we can find that the slenderness ratios lie within the ranges of practical ship structures i e β values are usually between 1 0 and 2 5 while λ values are between 0 05 and 1 0 as investigated by zhang 2016 based on real ships so similarity between them are acceptable 1 β b t p σ y e λ a π r σ y e in practical ship structures the diameter of pits lies within 25 80 mm as demonstrated by paik et al 2004 thus the diameter of pits was chosen to be 15 mm throughout the paper considering the dimension reduced experimental model comparing with practical ones to guarantee the mesh quality and represent the curvature features more than 10 mesh seeds were applied on circular boundaries meanwhile measures such as aspect ratio checking have been taken to guarantee mesh quality for easier manufacturing of the experimental model perforation like pitting corrosion was adopted as the limit of pitting corrosion in this study according to previous investigations the structural residual ultimate strength almost follows linear relationships with depth of normally distributed pitting corrosion so adoption of perforation like corrosion is reasonable for explanation of the structural collapse behaviors 2 2 experimental layout and testing system according to the previously mentioned experimental test design the experimental layout is shown in fig 4 where the compressive loads by loading system was transferred to the experimental models by adopting box shaped strong structures which can guarantee the uniform loading and avoid the possible stress concentration otherwise meanwhile the out of plane displacements were also constrained at the loading edges the longitudinal supporting structures are almost fully restrained at the ends by the strong structures connected and experimental facilities including the out of plane deformations the rotations of plating and stiffener webs on the other hand can be regarded as partially constrained additionally the strain gauges and displacement measurement gauges have been adopted to test the local strain distributions and overall displacements at specific structural locations of interest 3 nonlinear finite element analysis nonlinear finite element analysis nfea is a unified method in ultimate strength analysis for various kinds of engineering structures especially the complicated ones and has found wide applications with the rapid development of computers according to tanaka et al 2014 and discussions by xu et al 2013 the analysis models for continuous general stiffened plates can be divided into four kinds according to modelling scope in each direction along longitudinal girder and transverse frame i e the 1 2 1 2 span 1 2 1 2 bay 1 2 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 bay 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 2 bay and 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 bay models however we should note that above models can only be applied to multi bay and multi span continuous intact structures without openings especially off center openings or corrosion considering the special case of longitudinal girder like structures in this paper due to existence of asymmetric factors such as corrosion above models cannot be applied instead we select the one span one bay model which can well reflect the practical structural characteristics as shown in fig 7 which is in accordance with previous model settings in the models x y and z denote transverse vertical and longitudinal directions respectively simply supported boundary conditions are assigned on longitudinal ends which are also assumed to remain straight i e uniform normal displacements and also the boundaries are allowed to be pulled in freely as illustrated by tanaka et al 2014 stiffeners at the ends are kept perpendicular with the panel surface during the whole loading process while the rotation along stiffener web perpendicular axis is set free which can also be regarded as simply supported denote u v and w as the translational displacements in x y and z directions respectively and θ x θ y and θ z as the rotational displacements in x y and z directions respectively the boundary conditions are as follows 2 u a b u c d 0 θ x a b θ x c d θ z a b θ z c d 0 w a b u n i f o r m w c d u n i f o r m note that simply supported boundary conditions ignore the rotational rigidity along boundary axes for comparison the clamped boundary conditions are also investigated however we should explain that no boundary conditions are perfect due to the simplification and idealization process so comparison between different boundary conditions are meaningful which indicates the gap where actual situations lie within additionally we have also investigated the influences of initial deflections on the ultimate strengths of such structures firstly the true initial deflections are measured using a lasing scanning technique as shown in fig 5 reconstructing the geometric surface of the experimental test model by aid of distributed datum points the measured initial deflections for above three experimental models are shown in fig 6 in units of meters which is further processed for the relevant nfeas we can find that the initial deflections of models 1 and 2 are similar while that of model 3 is different statistics of the measured initial deflection has been summarized in table 2 with comparison of typical idealized initial deflection magnitudes as will be shown in the following parts for comparison the typical initial deflection types such as thin horse recommended by ueda and yao 1985 as well as the buckling mode type initial deflection based on eigenvalue and eigenvector solutions of buckling are adopted the residual stresses are not considered in this paper generally three types of initial deflections exist in practical structures i e the global mode of stiffened panels local mode of plates and tripping mode of stiffeners respective expressions are shown as follows with the coordinate system and displacements as defined before a local mode of plates the thin horse initial deflection is shown below where the detailed coefficients are according to ueda and yao 1985 as shown in table 3 3 u o p l k 1 11 a 0 k sin k π z a sin π y b where a denotes span between adjacent transverse frames and b denotes spacing between adjacent longitudinal stiffeners a 0 denotes the magnitude of the above initial deflection and is recommended as 0 1 β 2 t p where β b t p σ y e is the slenderness ratio t p plate thickness σ y material yield stress e young s modulus we should note that the above introduced buckling mode initial deflections correspond to intact structures without openings which is different from the buckling modes of structures with openings however we still adopted this type of initial deflection based on hypothesis that the initial deflections already exist before openings are made as well as considerations of structural continuity on different sides along stiffeners also as will be shown later we note that buckling in the plating on two sides plays a more important role in the progressive collapse of longitudinal girder since the buckling in plating with openings corresponds to higher order buckling modes different from the governing buckling mode of the stiffened panel which results in limited contribution combined with reduced sectional area this hypothesis that initial deflections already exist before openings are cut out has also been adopted in the case of thin horse initial deflections b global mode of stiffened panels 4 u o c b 0 sin π z a sin π y b where b denotes the double bottom height in this case and b 0 denotes the magnitude of the column type mode and is recommended as 0 0015a c tripping distortion of stiffeners 5 v o s c 0 x h w sin π z a where h w denotes the height of the stiffener and c 0 denotes the magnitude of the stiffener tripping mode and is recommended as 0 0015a 4 results and discussion firstly the uniaxial tensile test of specimen has been carried out to get the engineering stress strain curves then the true stress strain curve accounting for the sectional area change should be derived according to the following equations from which we can infer the true strain is smaller than engineering strain while true stress is larger the testing system and obtained testing results are shown in fig 8 which should be used to model the materials in numerical analysis 6 ε t r u e ln 1 ε e n g σ t r u e σ e n g 1 ε e n g 4 1 experimental results to capture the out of plane displacements at particular points of the structures 3 displacement gauges are set for model 1 4 are set for model 2 3 are set for model 3 as shown in figs 1 3 this can help understanding the structural collapse behaviors in the whole experimental processes the ultimate strength results of above three models are shown in fig 9 however we should note that the displacement includes the rigid body movements of the whole structure due to movements of connected structures so the displacement does not coincide with the one in load end shortening curves so the structural modulus derived from the force displacement curves is smaller than fem results thus only the captured ultimate strength value is used which is also the main interest by observing the displacement gauge and strain gauge results it is evident that for all 3 models the displacements grow rapidly as external load approaches ultimate load capacity and continue to grow beyond ultimate strengths we can find that due to existence of opening the compressive strains near the opening is substantially smaller than that near ends the strain distributions are not uniform along longitudinal direction in side square tubes and the strains in the same cross section are different either for top side and bottom locations indicating out of plane deformations or bending of the tubes in loading process which results from buckling and collapse of side plating due to the column type bending of stiffeners to the stiffener side the strain in stiffener web is larger than in stiffener flange and the strains are different along longitudinal direction the measured results are in accordance with the collapse shape as described in fig 21 and it is evident that not only the ultimate strengths but also the collapse shapes are different when considering different types of corrosion detailed differences regarding to above 3 experimental models are discussed more extensively in the following sections 4 1 1 results of model m1 as shown in fig 9 a the ultimate strength obtained by model test is 681 kn at the displacement of loading end about 5 mm the displacements by displacement gauges at measured locations are shown in fig 10 positive for compression in gauges from which downwards displacements are observed for opening edge and stiffener at measured points while upwards displacements are observed for middle of side plating which can be explained by the collapse development as shown in fig 21 turning point is observed in gauge 3 which is caused by the influence of column type bending downwards in collapse process the measured strains are shown in fig 11 figure b shows that the opening edge near stiffeners bear larger loads than side plating which even result in longitudinal tension after collapse buckling induced out of plane deformation and thus relaxation in bearing capacity figure c shows similar results as figure b but longitudinal compression is observed in all the positions indicating smaller out of plane deformations therein figure d shows similar results as figure b figure h shows that the symmetry between side square tubes only exists in the linear stage i e it cannot be guaranteed when applied loads approach ultimate strength 4 1 2 results of model m2 as shown in fig 9 b the ultimate strength obtained by model test is 675 kn at the displacement of loading end about 5 2 mm the displacements by displacement gauges at measured locations are shown in fig 12 positive for compression in gauges from which we can find downwards displacements for all the measured points which can be explained by the collapse development as shown in fig 21 turning points are observed in gauge 3 and 4 which is due to the effects caused by upwards bending of side square tubes the measured strains are shown in fig 13 figure b shows that stress and strain redistributes due to perforation and the maximum strain locates between perforations in side plating rather than near stiffeners or side tubes figure c shows that the maximum strains of the intact section locate along stiffeners different from figure b due to the offset from perforation as well as center opening along longitudinal direction figure d shows similar results as figure c although the measure points locate at the perforation along longitudinal direction figure h shows that the relatively weak symmetry between side square tubes only exists in the linear stage and the differences may lie within the initial deflection asymmetry 4 1 3 results of model m3 as shown in fig 9 c the ultimate strength obtained by model test is 625 kn at the displacement of loading end about 5 5 mm the displacements by displacement gauges at measured locations are shown in fig 14 positive for compression in gauges from which we can find downwards displacements for middle of side plating opening edge and stiffener at measured points which can be explained by the collapse development as shown in fig 21 no turning point in gauges has been observed as previous models because serious downwards bending is observed in the side square tubes the measured strains are shown in fig 15 from figure a asymmetry of strains are observed due to the irregular distribution of perforations the data from gauge no 31 is removed due to functional error figure b shows that the opening edge near stiffeners bear larger loads than side plating and asymmetry of strains are observed due to irregular distribution of perforations from figures c h asymmetry between tubes on both sides is observed that non simultaneous bending lies therein resulting in different residual deformation after collapse considering the equivalent corrosion volume with previous corroded model the ultimate strength of model 3 is lower than expected comparing with the nfea results as shown in fig 9 and also comparing with model 2 experimental results one possible reason should be the differences in deformation of side square tubes as shown in fig 16 i e the bending upwards cases result in relatively larger ultimate strengths than the bending downwards cases thus the deformation of side tubes including the initial deflections are very important for these kind of structures and special attention should be paid to the design and relevant measurements in the ultimate strength problems using this type of models 4 2 numerical simulation results by nfeas on the other hand we have carried out the numerical simulations according to corresponding nfeas based on commercial software abaqus to provide validation of applying nfeas in these kinds of structural analyses and to investigate the collapse modes between the numerical models and experimental models 4 2 1 finite element modelling according to the modelling details as mentioned before the finite element models of the three experimental models are shown in fig 17 where fine mesh is applied throughout the structures 4 2 2 finite element analysis results before performing the collapse analysis by carrying out nfeas the elastic buckling characteristics have been analyzed and the first 4 buckling modes have been shown in fig 18 where the eigenvalues are the buckling strength under uniaxial compression in units of mpa we can find that the out of plane deformations at center plating where opening locates are very small in the lower buckling modes compared with the other plating on the side due to the existence of free boundary conditions at the opening additionally the buckling modes are not completely symmetric which can be explained by the adoption of angle bar stiffeners induced asymmetry of the whole structures by using the measured initial deflections as previous shown in fig 6 the ultimate strength of the three models has been analyzed by using nfeas and the results are shown in fig 9 the calculated ultimate strengths for three models are 708 kn 664 kn and 666 kn respectively we can find that the ultimate strengths correspond to errors of 3 9 1 6 and 6 5 by comparison with experiments so the results can be acceptable using the nfeas considering the inevitable uncertainties in experimental tests i e the numerical methods by using nfeas are reasonable and can be served as an alternative for ultimate strength evaluations the stress distributions at ultimate strength are shown in fig 20 from figure a we can find that the middle plating enters plasticity only at opening area while the other area remain elastic due to existence of opening and also the middle parts of the sides plating starts to deform out of plane causing local tension and hence unloading of the whole structure in the cases with perforations however the plastic regions reduce substantially and the maximum compressive stresses concentrate at the regions with minimum sectional area the displacements are converted to the measurements by gauges in the experiment for clearer comparison as shown in fig 19 we can find that the displacements match well with that from experiments as explained earlier same phenomenon is observed for gauge no 3 in model 1 which changes signs after ultimate strength and similarly this can be explained by the collapse process where column type collapse propagates and half wave lengths change as to the out of plane deformations the maximum ones locate at the center opening area in middle plating for model 1 but at the perforation area in side plating within longitudinal opening extent for models 2 and 3 corresponding to minimum sectional areas additionally the half wave peaks are sharper for the corroded models at ultimate strength and the half wave lengths therein tend to be smaller than the intact case which can be explained by the degraded structural rigidity caused by corrosion the collapse shapes are shown in fig 21 and we can find very good matches between experimental and numerical results we have also investigated the stress distributions along transverse directions at longitudinal ends as shown in fig 22 we can find that the distributions remain symmetric for the models 1 and 2 due to the symmetry of both structures and corrosion while asymmetry is observed for the irregular corrosion case in model 3 one common phenomenon is observed that the middle plating area shows smaller capacity due to the opening corresponding to the minimum compressive stresses therein while maximum axial stresses locate at the sides based on both experimental and numerical results we have also noted an interesting phenomenon that the side square tubes always deform the same direction of the neighboring side plating i e the collapse shape of side plating directly influences the deformation of side square tubes and vice versa thus the interaction between them should be carefully investigated in design of such kind of experiments 4 2 3 influences of initial deflection types and boundary conditions initial deflections can be an important factor for ultimate strength analysis so we have also investigated the types of initial deflection besides the measured ones including the thin horse type and the buckling type obtained by eigenvalue analysis as mentioned before for clear comparison the same magnitudes are chosen to investigate the influences of different initial deflection types and the magnitude is selected the same as the thin horse type as defined before simply supported boundary conditions have been applied and the results are shown in fig 23 where experiment denotes the test results and fe idexp denotes the fe results based on measured initial deflection in model test and th denotes thin horse type initial deflection and bkl denotes buckling mode initial deflection and bkl 1 6 denotes the initial deflection by combination of first 6 order buckling modes from the figure we can find that the ultimate strength under thin horse type initial deflection almost gives the largest ultimate strength values while the minimum ones correspond not necessarily to the lower order buckling modes type initial deflections which may be due to the complexity lying within not only the structure itself but also the introduced pitting corrosion the force displacement curves by fem are shown in fig 24 for model 1 as an example exp denotes the measured initial deflection and we can find small differences in stiffness and ultimate strength between them with same magnitude e g the maximum difference is below 5 except the experimental results of model 3 by comparing the collapse between different types of initial deflections we can find that the stiffener tripping is very important in the ultimate strength of these kinds of structures i e serious stiffener tripping is observed in the cases of minimum ultimate strengths as shown in fig 25 as we have mentioned before the boundary conditions at the longitudinal ends are partially restrained so the boundary conditions should lie within the simply supported and the clamped ones so we have investigated the effects of boundary conditions and the results are shown in fig 26 the ultimate strengths obtained by nfeas are 711 7 kn 666 6 kn and 667 0 kn respectively for models 1 to 3 we can find that the differences are negligible compared with simply supported boundary conditions with maximum difference of 0 64 5 conclusions this paper focuses on the compressive ultimate strength of typical stiffened plates with openings subjected to perforation type corrosion and both experiments and numerical analyses are carried out it shows that both the ultimate strength values and collapse modes match well for the experiments and nfeas maximum difference of ultimate strength 6 5 the current design of experimental models can release the complicated setting of boundary conditions which is meaningful for similar types of structural experiments including both destructive and non destructive ones above structures show common characteristics of ultimate strength e g the collapse starts at the opening section with minimum residual sectional area which also corresponds to maximum out of plane deformation within the extent of center opening the half waves in corroded structures are sharper with smaller longitudinal half wave length additionally the following conclusions can also be drawn 1 deformations of side supporting structures are important for the ultimate strength and collapse analysis and they are influenced by collapse shape of side plating thus special attention should be paid to their interaction in these types of structural models including initial deflection effects 2 within the extent of opening strain distributions show relaxation in longitudinal compression near opening area along center line and maximum compression regions are near stiffeners or girders for intact structures but may transfer to middle of plating under different patterns of corrosion at longitudinal ends due to the opening maximum axial stresses strains locate at the sides 3 column type out of plane deformation accompanied with tripping deformation is observed for stiffeners in above three models to the stiffener side combined with same direction of deformations in side square tubes the ultimate strength can be substantially lower than expected model 3 4 the ultimate strengths are sensitive to initial deflections and thin horse modes result in larger ultimate strengths under same magnitudes of buckling type initial deflection the minimum ultimate strength does not necessarily correspond to the lower order modes thus the initial deflection should be carefully selected in the structural design and evaluations 5 even under same volume of corrosion both the structural ultimate strength and collapse may deviate substantially considering different types of corrosion especially within the extent of

21886,the heading control of surface vessels is an important issue in marine navigation and control engineering a nonzero drift angle is unavoidable when a ship is turning and it should be compensated by the heading controller the aim of this work is to enhance the robustness of steering control systems with un modelled dynamics parameter uncertainty and time varying disturbances a horizontal plane cascade steering model with drift angle is proposed and an adaptive backstepping control algorithm is developed to maintain the course tracking performance of a surface vessel based on the dynamic surface control and nussbaum gain techniques this controller can ensure that all errors and states in the closed loop system are globally uniformly ultimately bounded without any prior information about the nonlinear structure or external disturbances finally simulation results are included to verify the good performance of this control method in comparison with the lyapunov based heading controller graphical abstract keywords drift angle backstepping dynamic surface control nussbaum gain 1 introduction when a surface vessel is sailing along a seaway it may move with 6 degree of freedom dof motions owing to external time varying disturbances i e winds waves and currents many types of equipment and corresponding control systems have been developed to address these motions the autopilot system is the essential part of conventional ships that guarantees that a ship reaches its destination under various sea states and it is one of the major challenges in modern marine navigation a good autopilot can have great economic benefits by decreasing energy consumption enhancing security reducing the need for machine maintenance and providing comfort to the crew the stabilisation of the motions for a ship with an autopilot based control can be achieved by controlling the rotation of the rudder angle which induces heading control steering control and anti roll control in this study we concentrate on the heading control of a conventional surface vessel to simplify the process of autopilot control system design the nonlinear dynamic characteristics are always neglected and some researchers have investigated control algorithm based on linear steering models including the linear first order nomoto model and other linear coupling models banazaden and ghorbani 2013 designed a proportional integral derivative pid course keeping controller using a frequency domain identified first order nomoto model based on this type of nomoto model ejaz and chen 2017 proposed the fuzzy logic sliding mode control smc method for the steering of a surface ship wang and han 2017 employed a network based heading controller for unmanned surface vessels usvs in network environments considering the discrete time linear steering system li and sun 2012 developed a model predictive heading controller with state constraints using the model predictive control mpc method and linear 4 dof coupling model liu et al 2015 and zhang et al 2017a studied course tracking controllers of underactuated surface vessels with roll motion constraints however steering models may suffer from parameter uncertainties nonlinear characteristics and even un modelled dynamics under time varying and rough external disturbances therefore heading controllers that are based on accurate models and deterministic parameter conditions may achieve limited performance to address unknown disturbances a disturbance rejection i e including internal disturbances and external disturbances steering control system was introduced by lei and guo 2015 ejaz and chen 2018 employed a disturbance observer do and developed an optimal backstepping heading controller an extended state observer eso technique was also used in the steering autopilot control system das and talole 2016 to address the parameter uncertainty problem the nussbaum gain method may be a good solution du et al 2014 studied a nussbaum gain based course keeping controller for ships with a backstepping technique further wu and du 2019 developed this method for the course tracking problem for a seagoing vessel with speed variation and they all used the first order nonlinear nomoto model in addition based on backstepping and nussbaum gain methods a trajectory tracking controller was developed for a fully actuated surface vessel zheng et al 2018 another good method to handle time varying disturbances and system uncertainties is called adaptive control do et al 2003 do and pan 2006 developed a series of robust adaptive course tracking controllers for underactuated ships based on lyapunov s direct method and backstepping technique under the condition of sway motion passive boundedness neuro network nn and smc methods were combined with adaptive backstepping for the path following and navigation control of underactuated ships however these works were all based on the known control coefficients and known dimensions of model parameters li et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 heading control includes course keeping and course changing manoeuvres the first order nomoto model can maintain course keeping control very well by some nonlinear control methods zhang et al 2017b 2018 but higher order nonlinear steering conditions should be considered for the course changing control consider the second order nonlinear nomoto model witkowska and smierzchalski 2007 2012 investigated backstepping and adaptive backstepping ship course controllers without external disturbances perera and soares 2012 2013 studied sliding mode lyapunov and hurwitz based controllers for the nonlinear vessel steering problem these studies considered nonlinear manoeuvrability features but they did not add the drift angle sideslip angle problem i e the drift angle was treated as zero the nonzero drift angle is the relative angle between the course angle and the x b direction and it must be amended in the vessel steering control system fossen et al 2015 proposed an adaptive sideslip compensation path following controller that treats the drift angle as a constant parameter to address drifting effects in path following control hu et al 2016 developed a robust composite nonlinear controller but this method requires the measurement of the sway motion shin et al 2017 considered the slip problem of a usv while turning and presented an adaptive path following controller with a linear 2 dof coupling model in this study under the condition of unknown external time varying disturbances considering the nonzero time varying drift angle un modelled dynamics and parameter uncertainty problems in a nonlinear steering control system second order nonlinear nomoto model we designed an adaptive backstepping heading controller for surface vessels that are subject to external time varying disturbances without sway information unlike previous approaches the accurate information about the parameter dimension is not required and a second order pre filter is selected to provide a smooth reference course the remainder of this note is exploited as follows second 2 formulates the nonlinear heading model with the drift angle effects and the cascade state space steering model the design process of the adaptive backstepping heading controller is expressed in section 3 in section 4 the simulation results are displaced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control method and the conclusion is given in section 5 2 problem formulation 2 1 mathematical model the surface vessel steering system is described by two coordinate systems i e the earth fixed coordinate system x 0 o 0 y 0 and body fixed coordinate system x b o b y b the yaw motion of a surface vessel is shown in fig 1 note that there is a small nonzero drift angle β in turnings which is typically less than 5 because of this drift angle the desired course angle cannot be followed accurately when the heading error is defined as ψ e ψ ψ d in the control design process therefore the drift angle should be known in the present investigations model based steering control methods for marine vehicles are usually based on nomoto models as the first order nomoto model is suitable for course keeping control rather than course changing control the model must consider the nonlinear steering conditions as presented by amerongen and cate 1975 hence the modified second order nomoto model is written as 1 ψ 3 1 t 1 1 t 2 ψ k r t 1 t 2 h ψ k r t 1 t 2 t 3 δ δ where ψ is the actual heading angle yaw angle δ is the rudder angle and t 1 t 2 t 3 k r are the model coefficients hence h ψ n 1 ψ n 2 ψ 3 is the nonlinear function of the heading angle velocity yaw rate n 1 and n 2 are the function parameters and a course stable ship satisfies n 1 0 then the nonlinear steering model can be rewritten as 2 ψ 3 a 1 ψ 3 a 2 ψ a 3 ψ b 1 δ b 2 δ where the parameters are defined as a 1 n 2 k r t 1 t 2 a 2 n 1 k r t 1 t 2 a 3 1 t 1 1 t 2 b 1 k r t 1 t 2 and b 2 k r t 3 t 1 t 2 this steering model does not consider the drift angle problem of a surface vessel while turning the first lag model for the drift angle was suggested by yu et al 2008 which extended the concept of the linear nomoto model toward sideslip the model is expressed as t β β k r where the parameters satisfy t k 1 and r ψ is the yaw rate we modified this model as 3 β c 1 β c 2 ψ δ β where δ β δ c 1 β δ c 2 ψ is the bounded uncertainty i e δ β δ β m a x and δ β m a x is an unknown positive constant because t and k can be perturbed by the forward speed and sailing resistance hence c 1 and c 2 are positive nominal values that satisfy 0 c 1 1 0 c 2 1 as a result of the above equations the final drift angle based nonlinear surface vessel steering system cascade state space model can be given as follows 4 x 1 x 3 x 2 c 1 x 2 c 2 x 3 δ β x 3 x 4 x 4 f x g t u w where the system states are defined as x 1 ψ x 2 β x 3 ψ and x 4 ψ here u δ b 2 b 1 δ is the control input of the rudder servo system the steering gear system is presented in fig 2 the bounded external time varying disturbance is denoted by w the functions f x a 1 ψ 3 a 2 ψ a 3 ψ and g t b 1 are un modelled dynamics and parameter uncertainty of this nonlinear system accurate knowledge of the two functions is not required in the control design process remark 1 as f x is the continuous function of the heading angle velocity there is a smooth function f 0 x that can be seen as the upper bound of f x and it satisfies f x f 0 x f 0 m a x where f 0 m a x is an unknown positive constant remark 2 as suggested by perera and soares 2012 the main objective of the steering machine system is to convert the control signal u i e generated by the adaptive backstepping controller into the rudder angle and rudder rate accurate control of the rudder angle and rudder rate conditions is not required 2 2 preliminaries to deal with the parameter uncertainty g t the nussbaum gain method was chosen in this study a continuous function n ζ is called a nussbaum function if it handles the following formulations 5 lim s sup 0 s n ζ d ζ 6 lim s sup 0 s n ζ d ζ commonly used nussbaum functions contain ζ 2 cos

backstepping robust heading controller for a surface vessel it employs the dynamic surface control dsc and nussbaum gain techniques as mentioned before the drift angle can increase the overshooting and steady stable errors of the heading control especially in sharp turns to decrease the drifting effects we redefine the heading error as 8 ψ e ψ ψ d β considering assumptions 1 to 3 the control structure is presented in detail in the first step based on the system model 4 a new variable is introduced as 9 z 1 ψ e x 1 ψ d x 2 to make the heading error converge to zero the lyapunov function candidate lfc is formulated as follows 10 v 1 1 2 z 1 2 the derivative of the lfc is obtained by differentiating 10 it is displaced as follows 11 v 1 z 1 z 1 z 1 x 1 ψ d x 2 z 1 c 1 x 2 1 c 2 x 3 ψ d δ β a virtual control law is chosen for the heading error 12 α 1 1 1 c 2 k 1 z 1 c 1 x 2 ψ d δ ˆ β where k 1 is a positive constant value to avoid the explosion of complexity problem the dsc method is exploited shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 the virtual control α 1 is passed through a first order filter which is expressed as 13 γ 1 α 1 f α 1 f α 1 α 1 f 0 α 1 0 where γ 1 0 is the design parameter α 1 f is the filtered virtual control the filtering error ε 1 α 1 α 1 f is obtained as the states x 1 and x 2 are all driven by the state x 3 we define a new error variable as 14 z 2 x 3 α 1 f x 3 α 1 ε 1 then eq 11 can be rewritten as 15 v 1 k 1 z 1 2 1 c 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 to stabilise the second error variable the next lfc is chosen as follows 16 v 2 v 1 1 2 z 2 2 17 v 2 v 1 z 2 z 2 v 1 z 2 x 3 α 1 f k 1 z 1 2 z 2 1 c 2 z 1 x 4 α 1 f z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 the second virtual control law for v 2 is selected and expressed as 18 α 2 k 2 z 2 1 c 2 z 1 α 1 f where k 2 is a positive design parameter in a similar way the virtual control α 2 passes the following dynamic surface 19 γ 2 α 2 f α 2 f α 2 α 2 f 0 α 2 0 where γ 2 0 is the time constant and α 2 f is the filtered virtual control the filtering error ε 2 α 2 α 2 f is also obtained and the third error variable for the state x 4 is defined as 20 z 3 x 4 α 2 f x 4 α 2 ε 2 the derivative of v 2 yields 21 v 2 k 1 z 1 2 z 2 1 c 2 z 1 z 3 α 2 ε 2 α 1 f z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 k 1 z 1 2 k 2 z 2 2 z 2 z 3 z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 z 2 ε 2 to make the error variable z 3 stabilised the third lfc is considered as follows 22 v 3 v 2 1 2 z 3 2 its derivative results in 23 v 3 v 2 z 3 z 3 v 2 z 3 x 4 α 2 f k 1 z 1 2 k 2 z 2 2 z 3 z 2 f x g t u w α 2 f z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 z 2 ε 2 then the following control law is proposed as 24 u n ζ k 3 z

of 23 as follows 26 v 3 z 3 z 2 f x g t u w α 2 f h x h x k 1 z 1 2 k 2 z 2 2 z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 z 2 ε 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 2 z 2 2 k 3 z 3 2 g t n ζ 1 ζ z 3 f x z 3 w w ˆ m a x z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 z 2 ε 2 to minimise the approximate errors of uncertainties external time varying disturbance and the filtering error of virtual control laws we consider the final lfc 27 v v 3 1 2 a β δ β 2 1 2 a f f 2 x

considering the dynamic surfaces 13 and 19 we know ε i d α i d t ε i γ i b i ε i γ i b i m ε i γ i where i 1 2 b i is a continuous function of closed loop signals it can be seen as the upper bound of d α i d t i e d α i d t b i and it has the maximum value of b i m therefore we obtain the following inequality 29 ε i ε i ε i d α i d t ε i 2 γ i ε i b i m ε i 2 γ i ε i 2 2 b i m 2 2 ε i 2 γ i in a similar way we have the following inequalities regarding filtering errors 30 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 1 c 2 2 2 z 1 2 1 2 ε 1 2 31 z 2 ε 2 1 2 z 2 2 1 2 ε 2 2 base on assumption 1 we know that w w m a x and we

uub on 0 t f as presented by 18 if the solution of the closed loop is bounded then t f therefore all states and errors in the closed loop heading control system are globally uniformly ultimately bounded guub the structure of the control system is presented in fig 3 considering the commanded course angle ψ r a second order filter is employed to derive the smooth heading angle ψ d and heading rate ψ d this approach can avoid a large rudder angle and rudder rate variations especially in sharp turns the proposed pre filter is addressed as follows 43 ψ d 2 ξ ψ ω ψ ψ d ω ψ 2 ψ d ω ψ 2 ψ r where ξ ψ is the damping ω ψ is the frequency which are known positive constants when ψ r is a constant value it follows that lim t ψ d t ψ r 3 2 lyapunov based control based on the nonlinear steering model 1 perera and soares 2013 investigated hurwitz based control hbc lyapunov based control lbc and pid type heading controller by applying the input output linearisation iol method the lbc obtain the best performance hence we considered this lbc heading controller for comparison this controller is expressed as follows 44 u 1 b 2 ψ ψ ψ ψ d ψ d 3 3 parameters selection generally the selection of parameters can affect the performance of the designed control system for the pre filter it should be an over damping member in order to derive the smooth heading angle and heading rate in sharp turns it is meaning that the damping and frequency satisfy ξ ψ 1 and 0 ω ψ 1 for the initial value of adaptation laws w ˆ max 0 and δ ˆ β 0 should be near the maximum value of w and δ β f ˆ 0 and ζ 0 can be selected as two small values the controller gains k 1 k 2 and k 3 are used for penalising the errors of heading angle heading rate and heading angular velocity respectively the positive constant satisfies λ min 0 in eq 40 then we have k 1 0 5 k 2 0 5 k 3 0 5 0 γ 1 1 and 0 γ 2 1 the selection of these parameters is dependent on the significant of tuning objective e g k 3 k 1 since k 3 exists in the control law eq 24 and it may affect the control performance more directly the adaptation law parameters a β a f a w σ β σ f and σ w are determined according to the system uncertainties and the external disturbance small positive values i e less than 5 can implement the control objective in general 4 simulations the proposed adaptive backstepping and lbc methods are implemented by matlab codes considering the vessel model introduced by amerongen and cate 1975 in order to simulate the internal disturbance we define the time varying control gain as g t b 1 1 0 5 randn 1 the nonzero mean value external time varying disturbance model and the internal uncertainty of the drift angle model are assumed as follows 45 w 0 3 0 1 0 1 cos 0 3 t 0 1 sin 0 5 t 46 δ β 0 015 0 1 sin 0 2 t 0 1 cos 0 3 t the rudder angle limitation is chosen as δ m a x π 4 rad and the parameters of the steering model are given by perera and soares 2013 where a 1 0 371 a 2 0 434 a 3 3 4 b 1 0 35 and b 2 0 1225 the initial values of the nonlinear model and controller are given as follows ψ 0 β 0 ψ 0 ψ 0 0 0 0 0 α 1 f 0 α 2 f 0 0 δ ˆ β 0 0 03 f ˆ 0 0 1 w ˆ m a x 0 0 05 ζ 0 1 4 the parameters of the proposed controller are exploited as k 1 0 5 k 2 1 k 3 3 γ 1 0 8 γ 2 0 1 a β 5 a f 5 a w 1 ξ ψ 1 2 ω ψ 0 4 σ β 1 σ f 5 σ w 1 heading control contains course keeping control processes and course changing control processes therefore we define the desired course angle as follows 47 ψ r 30 deg t 60 s 0 deg 60 t 120 s 30 deg t 120 s case 1 compare with lbc the simulation results are presented in figs 4 to 8 the heading angle and heading error time series are plotted in figs 4 and 5 respectively we can see that both of the controllers can track the desired course with good performance however the proposed control algorithm can follow the course more accurately i e smaller overshoots and steady state errors fig 6 demonstrates the results of drift angle and the heading angle velocities are compared in fig 7 as the drift angle is driven by the heading rate i e according to the model expressed in 3 the drift angle responses of the two control frameworks are very similar but the lbc shows some small fluctuations because of fluctuation of the heading rate in course keeping in the plot of fig 8 the rudder angle time histories are displaced in course keeping the rudder angles of the proposed controller are smaller than those of lbc but rudder responses are bigger than lbc in course changing this is mainly because the proposed controller must compensate the relatively large drift angles to maintain its course tracking performance during sharp turns and this phenomenon does not affect the performance of the adaptive backstepping controller fig 9 depicts the rudder rate responses lbc gives more roughly chattering which can increase the wear and tear on the steering gear because the lbc cannot handle the time varying control gain i e internal disturbance problem case 2 compare with the adaptive backstepping controller abc without drift angles in order to specify that such drift angle errors cannot be minimised by only the heading controller we left out the drift angle model in eq 4 and considered the states x 1 ψ x 2 ψ and x 3 ψ i e β δ β 0 then we design the abc with the same process and parameters for comparison the simulation results are presented in figs 10 and 11 the drift angle under consideration is part of the heading control error clearly with similar rudder angle responses the abc w o drift angles cannot hold the stable heading error very well 5 conclusion in this study one concentrates on the course angle tracking problem of surface vessels an adaptive backstepping controller to steer a ship to follow the desired heading with time varying disturbances model uncertainties and control coefficient uncertainty has been proposed considering the drift angle based cascade state space nonlinear steering model the adaptive method is employed to approximate the un modelled dynamics and the upper bound of external disturbance the dsc technique was chosen to ease the derivative of virtual control laws and the nussbaum gain approach is applied to handle the control parameter uncertainty problem this controller does not require any knowledge of the nonlinear dynamics or internal uncertainty a second order pre filter is employed to smooth the predefined heading and this controller can guarantee that all states and errors in the closed loop system will be guub in comparison with the controller proposed by perera and soares 2013 and a heading only controller simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the further work it is of interest to consider the effects of time varying ship forward speed on the second order nonlinear heading model yaw motions due to steering can result in speed loss especially in sharp turns therefore we intend to investigate a novel adaptive robust heading controller

21886,the heading control of surface vessels is an important issue in marine navigation and control engineering a nonzero drift angle is unavoidable when a ship is turning and it should be compensated by the heading controller the aim of this work is to enhance the robustness of steering control systems with un modelled dynamics parameter uncertainty and time varying disturbances a horizontal plane cascade steering model with drift angle is proposed and an adaptive backstepping control algorithm is developed to maintain the course tracking performance of a surface vessel based on the dynamic surface control and nussbaum gain techniques this controller can ensure that all errors and states in the closed loop system are globally uniformly ultimately bounded without any prior information about the nonlinear structure or external disturbances finally simulation results are included to verify the good performance of this control method in comparison with the lyapunov based heading controller graphical abstract keywords drift angle backstepping dynamic surface control nussbaum gain 1 introduction when a surface vessel is sailing along a seaway it may move with 6 degree of freedom dof motions owing to external time varying disturbances i e winds waves and currents many types of equipment and corresponding control systems have been developed to address these motions the autopilot system is the essential part of conventional ships that guarantees that a ship reaches its destination under various sea states and it is one of the major challenges in modern marine navigation a good autopilot can have great economic benefits by decreasing energy consumption enhancing security reducing the need for machine maintenance and providing comfort to the crew the stabilisation of the motions for a ship with an autopilot based control can be achieved by controlling the rotation of the rudder angle which induces heading control steering control and anti roll control in this study we concentrate on the heading control of a conventional surface vessel to simplify the process of autopilot control system design the nonlinear dynamic characteristics are always neglected and some researchers have investigated control algorithm based on linear steering models including the linear first order nomoto model and other linear coupling models banazaden and ghorbani 2013 designed a proportional integral derivative pid course keeping controller using a frequency domain identified first order nomoto model based on this type of nomoto model ejaz and chen 2017 proposed the fuzzy logic sliding mode control smc method for the steering of a surface ship wang and han 2017 employed a network based heading controller for unmanned surface vessels usvs in network environments considering the discrete time linear steering system li and sun 2012 developed a model predictive heading controller with state constraints using the model predictive control mpc method and linear 4 dof coupling model liu et al 2015 and zhang et al 2017a studied course tracking controllers of underactuated surface vessels with roll motion constraints however steering models may suffer from parameter uncertainties nonlinear characteristics and even un modelled dynamics under time varying and rough external disturbances therefore heading controllers that are based on accurate models and deterministic parameter conditions may achieve limited performance to address unknown disturbances a disturbance rejection i e including internal disturbances and external disturbances steering control system was introduced by lei and guo 2015 ejaz and chen 2018 employed a disturbance observer do and developed an optimal backstepping heading controller an extended state observer eso technique was also used in the steering autopilot control system das and talole 2016 to address the parameter uncertainty problem the nussbaum gain method may be a good solution du et al 2014 studied a nussbaum gain based course keeping controller for ships with a backstepping technique further wu and du 2019 developed this method for the course tracking problem for a seagoing vessel with speed variation and they all used the first order nonlinear nomoto model in addition based on backstepping and nussbaum gain methods a trajectory tracking controller was developed for a fully actuated surface vessel zheng et al 2018 another good method to handle time varying disturbances and system uncertainties is called adaptive control do et al 2003 do and pan 2006 developed a series of robust adaptive course tracking controllers for underactuated ships based on lyapunov s direct method and backstepping technique under the condition of sway motion passive boundedness neuro network nn and smc methods were combined with adaptive backstepping for the path following and navigation control of underactuated ships however these works were all based on the known control coefficients and known dimensions of model parameters li et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 heading control includes course keeping and course changing manoeuvres the first order nomoto model can maintain course keeping control very well by some nonlinear control methods zhang et al 2017b 2018 but higher order nonlinear steering conditions should be considered for the course changing control consider the second order nonlinear nomoto model witkowska and smierzchalski 2007 2012 investigated backstepping and adaptive backstepping ship course controllers without external disturbances perera and soares 2012 2013 studied sliding mode lyapunov and hurwitz based controllers for the nonlinear vessel steering problem these studies considered nonlinear manoeuvrability features but they did not add the drift angle sideslip angle problem i e the drift angle was treated as zero the nonzero drift angle is the relative angle between the course angle and the x b direction and it must be amended in the vessel steering control system fossen et al 2015 proposed an adaptive sideslip compensation path following controller that treats the drift angle as a constant parameter to address drifting effects in path following control hu et al 2016 developed a robust composite nonlinear controller but this method requires the measurement of the sway motion shin et al 2017 considered the slip problem of a usv while turning and presented an adaptive path following controller with a linear 2 dof coupling model in this study under the condition of unknown external time varying disturbances considering the nonzero time varying drift angle un modelled dynamics and parameter uncertainty problems in a nonlinear steering control system second order nonlinear nomoto model we designed an adaptive backstepping heading controller for surface vessels that are subject to external time varying disturbances without sway information unlike previous approaches the accurate information about the parameter dimension is not required and a second order pre filter is selected to provide a smooth reference course the remainder of this note is exploited as follows second 2 formulates the nonlinear heading model with the drift angle effects and the cascade state space steering model the design process of the adaptive backstepping heading controller is expressed in section 3 in section 4 the simulation results are displaced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control method and the conclusion is given in section 5 2 problem formulation 2 1 mathematical model the surface vessel steering system is described by two coordinate systems i e the earth fixed coordinate system x 0 o 0 y 0 and body fixed coordinate system x b o b y b the yaw motion of a surface vessel is shown in fig 1 note that there is a small nonzero drift angle β in turnings which is typically less than 5 because of this drift angle the desired course angle cannot be followed accurately when the heading error is defined as ψ e ψ ψ d in the control design process therefore the drift angle should be known in the present investigations model based steering control methods for marine vehicles are usually based on nomoto models as the first order nomoto model is suitable for course keeping control rather than course changing control the model must consider the nonlinear steering conditions as presented by amerongen and cate 1975 hence the modified second order nomoto model is written as 1 ψ 3 1 t 1 1 t 2 ψ k r t 1 t 2 h ψ k r t 1 t 2 t 3 δ δ where ψ is the actual heading angle yaw angle δ is the rudder angle and t 1 t 2 t 3 k r are the model coefficients hence h ψ n 1 ψ n 2 ψ 3 is the nonlinear function of the heading angle velocity yaw rate n 1 and n 2 are the function parameters and a course stable ship satisfies n 1 0 then the nonlinear steering model can be rewritten as 2 ψ 3 a 1 ψ 3 a 2 ψ a 3 ψ b 1 δ b 2 δ where the parameters are defined as a 1 n 2 k r t 1 t 2 a 2 n 1 k r t 1 t 2 a 3 1 t 1 1 t 2 b 1 k r t 1 t 2 and b 2 k r t 3 t 1 t 2 this steering model does not consider the drift angle problem of a surface vessel while turning the first lag model for the drift angle was suggested by yu et al 2008 which extended the concept of the linear nomoto model toward sideslip the model is expressed as t β β k r where the parameters satisfy t k 1 and r ψ is the yaw rate we modified this model as 3 β c 1 β c 2 ψ δ β where δ β δ c 1 β δ c 2 ψ is the bounded uncertainty i e δ β δ β m a x and δ β m a x is an unknown positive constant because t and k can be perturbed by the forward speed and sailing resistance hence c 1 and c 2 are positive nominal values that satisfy 0 c 1 1 0 c 2 1 as a result of the above equations the final drift angle based nonlinear surface vessel steering system cascade state space model can be given as follows 4 x 1 x 3 x 2 c 1 x 2 c 2 x 3 δ β x 3 x 4 x 4 f x g t u w where the system states are defined as x 1 ψ x 2 β x 3 ψ and x 4 ψ here u δ b 2 b 1 δ is the control input of the rudder servo system the steering gear system is presented in fig 2 the bounded external time varying disturbance is denoted by w the functions f x a 1 ψ 3 a 2 ψ a 3 ψ and g t b 1 are un modelled dynamics and parameter uncertainty of this nonlinear system accurate knowledge of the two functions is not required in the control design process remark 1 as f x is the continuous function of the heading angle velocity there is a smooth function f 0 x that can be seen as the upper bound of f x and it satisfies f x f 0 x f 0 m a x where f 0 m a x is an unknown positive constant remark 2 as suggested by perera and soares 2012 the main objective of the steering machine system is to convert the control signal u i e generated by the adaptive backstepping controller into the rudder angle and rudder rate accurate control of the rudder angle and rudder rate conditions is not required 2 2 preliminaries to deal with the parameter uncertainty g t the nussbaum gain method was chosen in this study a continuous function n ζ is called a nussbaum function if it handles the following formulations 5 lim s sup 0 s n ζ d ζ 6 lim s sup 0 s n ζ d ζ commonly used nussbaum functions contain ζ 2 cos ζ ζ 2 sin ζ and e ζ 2 cos 0 5 π ζ throughout the note of ge and wang 2003 the even nussbaum function e ζ 2 cos 0 5 π ζ is employed lemma 1 ge and wang 2003 let v t and ζ t be smooth functions defined on 0 t f with v t 0 t 0 t f and n ζ is an even smooth nussbaum function if the following inequality holds 7 v t c 0 e c 1 t 0 t g 0 τ n ζ 1 ζ e c 1 τ d τ where the constant c 1 0 and g 0 τ is a time varying parameter which takes values in the unknown closed intervals i l l with 0 i and c 0 denotes some suitable constant then v t ζ t and 0 t g 0 τ n ζ ζ d τ must be bounded on 0 t f furthermore if the solution of the system is bounded then we have t f ryan 1991 assumption 1 the external time varying disturbance is bounded in sense that w w m a x where w m a x is an unknown positive constant assumption 2 the desired heading angle and its derivative are all bounded i e ψ d and ψ d are bounded assumption 3 the unstructured system uncertainties are all slowly varying i e f x 0 and δ β 0 notations here represents the absolute of a scalar ˆ is the estimate of and ˆ is the estimation error 3 control design 3 1 adaptive backstepping control this section presents the design of an adaptive backstepping robust heading controller for a surface vessel it employs the dynamic surface control dsc and nussbaum gain techniques as mentioned before the drift angle can increase the overshooting and steady stable errors of the heading control especially in sharp turns to decrease the drifting effects we redefine the heading error as 8 ψ e ψ ψ d β considering assumptions 1 to 3 the control structure is presented in detail in the first step based on the system model 4 a new variable is introduced as 9 z 1 ψ e x 1 ψ d x 2 to make the heading error converge to zero the lyapunov function candidate lfc is formulated as follows 10 v 1 1 2 z 1 2 the derivative of the lfc is obtained by differentiating 10 it is displaced as follows 11 v 1 z 1 z 1 z 1 x 1 ψ d x 2 z 1 c 1 x 2 1 c 2 x 3 ψ d δ β a virtual control law is chosen for the heading error 12 α 1 1 1 c 2 k 1 z 1 c 1 x 2 ψ d δ ˆ β where k 1 is a positive constant value to avoid the explosion of complexity problem the dsc method is exploited shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 the virtual control α 1 is passed through a first order filter which is expressed as 13 γ 1 α 1 f α 1 f α 1 α 1 f 0 α 1 0 where γ 1 0 is the design parameter α 1 f is the filtered virtual control the filtering error ε 1 α 1 α 1 f is obtained as the states x 1 and x 2 are all driven by the state x 3 we define a new error variable as 14 z 2 x 3 α 1 f x 3 α 1 ε 1 then eq 11 can be rewritten as 15 v 1 k 1 z 1 2 1 c 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 to stabilise the second error variable the next lfc is chosen as follows 16 v 2 v 1 1 2 z 2 2 17 v 2 v 1 z 2 z 2 v 1 z 2 x 3 α 1 f k 1 z 1 2 z 2 1 c 2 z 1 x 4 α 1 f z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 the second virtual control law for v 2 is selected and expressed as 18 α 2 k 2 z 2 1 c 2 z 1 α 1 f where k 2 is a positive design parameter in a similar way the virtual control α 2 passes the following dynamic surface 19 γ 2 α 2 f α 2 f α 2 α 2 f 0 α 2 0 where γ 2 0 is the time constant and α 2 f is the filtered virtual control the filtering error ε 2 α 2 α 2 f is also obtained and the third error variable for the state x 4 is defined as 20 z 3 x 4 α 2 f x 4 α 2 ε 2 the derivative of v 2 yields 21 v 2 k 1 z 1 2 z 2 1 c 2 z 1 z 3 α 2 ε 2 α 1 f z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 k 1 z 1 2 k 2 z 2 2 z 2 z 3 z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 z 2 ε 2 to make the error variable z 3 stabilised the third lfc is considered as follows 22 v 3 v 2 1 2 z 3 2 its derivative results in 23 v 3 v 2 z 3 z 3 v 2 z 3 x 4 α 2 f k 1 z 1 2 k 2 z 2 2 z 3 z 2 f x g t u w α 2 f z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 z 2 ε 2 then the following control law is proposed as 24 u n ζ k 3 z

of 23 as follows 26 v 3 z 3 z 2 f x g t u w α 2 f h x h x k 1 z 1 2 k 2 z 2 2 z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 z 2 ε 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 2 z 2 2 k 3 z 3 2 g t n ζ 1 ζ z 3 f x z 3 w w ˆ m a x z 1 δ β 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 z 2 ε 2 to minimise the approximate errors of uncertainties external time varying disturbance and the filtering error of virtual control laws we consider the final lfc 27 v v 3 1 2 a β δ β 2 1 2 a f f 2 x

considering the dynamic surfaces 13 and 19 we know ε i d α i d t ε i γ i b i ε i γ i b i m ε i γ i where i 1 2 b i is a continuous function of closed loop signals it can be seen as the upper bound of d α i d t i e d α i d t b i and it has the maximum value of b i m therefore we obtain the following inequality 29 ε i ε i ε i d α i d t ε i 2 γ i ε i b i m ε i 2 γ i ε i 2 2 b i m 2 2 ε i 2 γ i in a similar way we have the following inequalities regarding filtering errors 30 1 c 2 z 1 ε 1 1 c 2 2 2 z 1 2 1 2 ε 1 2 31 z 2 ε 2 1 2 z 2 2 1 2 ε 2 2 base on assumption 1 we know that w w m a x and we

where σ β σ f and σ w are positive constants and w ˆ m a x 0 is the initial value of w ˆ m a x considering inequalities 29 to 32 eqs 33 to 35 and lemma 1 the derivative of 27 yields 36 v k 1 z 1 2 k 2

uub on 0 t f as presented by 18 if the solution of the closed loop is bounded then t f therefore all states and errors in the closed loop heading control system are globally uniformly ultimately bounded guub the structure of the control system is presented in fig 3 considering the commanded course angle ψ r a second order filter is employed to derive the smooth heading angle ψ d and heading rate ψ d this approach can avoid a large rudder angle and rudder rate variations especially in sharp turns the proposed pre filter is addressed as follows 43 ψ d 2 ξ ψ ω ψ ψ d ω ψ 2 ψ d ω ψ 2 ψ r where ξ ψ is the damping ω ψ is the frequency which are known positive constants when ψ r is a constant value it follows that lim t ψ d t ψ r 3 2 lyapunov based control based on the nonlinear steering model 1 perera and soares 2013 investigated hurwitz based control hbc lyapunov based control lbc and pid type heading controller by applying the input output linearisation iol method the lbc obtain the best performance hence we considered this lbc heading controller for comparison this controller is expressed as follows 44 u 1 b 2 ψ ψ ψ ψ d ψ d 3 3 parameters selection generally the selection of parameters can affect the performance of the designed control system for the pre filter it should be an over damping member in order to derive the smooth heading angle and heading rate in sharp turns it is meaning that the damping and frequency satisfy ξ ψ 1 and 0 ω ψ 1 for the initial value of adaptation laws w ˆ max 0 and δ ˆ β 0 should be near the maximum value of w and δ β f ˆ 0 and ζ 0 can be selected as two small values the controller gains k 1 k 2 and k 3 are used for penalising the errors of heading angle heading rate and heading angular velocity respectively the positive constant satisfies λ min 0 in eq 40 then we have k 1 0 5 k 2 0 5 k 3 0 5 0 γ 1 1 and 0 γ 2 1 the selection of these parameters is dependent on the significant of tuning objective e g k 3 k 1 since k 3 exists in the control law eq 24 and it may affect the control performance more directly the adaptation law parameters a β a f a w σ β σ f and σ w are determined according to the system uncertainties and the external disturbance small positive values i e less than 5 can implement the control objective in general 4 simulations the proposed adaptive backstepping and lbc methods are implemented by matlab codes considering the vessel model introduced by amerongen and cate 1975 in order to simulate the internal disturbance we define the time varying control gain as g t b 1 1 0 5 randn 1 the nonzero mean value external time varying disturbance model and the internal uncertainty of the drift angle model are assumed as follows 45 w 0 3 0 1 0 1 cos 0 3 t 0 1 sin 0 5 t 46 δ β 0 015 0 1 sin 0 2 t 0 1 cos 0 3 t the rudder angle limitation is chosen as δ m a x π 4 rad and the parameters of the steering model are given by perera and soares 2013 where a 1 0 371 a 2 0 434 a 3 3 4 b 1 0 35 and b 2 0 1225 the initial values of the nonlinear model and controller are given as follows ψ 0 β 0 ψ 0 ψ 0 0 0 0 0 α 1 f 0 α 2 f 0 0 δ ˆ β 0 0 03 f ˆ 0 0 1 w ˆ m a x 0 0 05 ζ 0 1 4 the parameters of the proposed controller are exploited as k 1 0 5 k 2 1 k 3 3 γ 1 0 8 γ 2 0 1 a β 5 a f 5 a w 1 ξ ψ 1 2 ω ψ 0 4 σ β 1 σ f 5 σ w 1 heading control contains course keeping control processes and course changing control processes therefore we define the desired course angle as follows 47 ψ r 30 deg t 60 s 0 deg 60 t 120 s 30 deg t 120 s case 1 compare with lbc the simulation results are presented in figs 4 to 8 the heading angle and heading error time series are plotted in figs 4 and 5 respectively we can see that both of the controllers can track the desired course with good performance however the proposed control algorithm can follow the course more accurately i e smaller overshoots and steady state errors fig 6 demonstrates the results of drift angle and the heading angle velocities are compared in fig 7 as the drift angle is driven by the heading rate i e according to the model expressed in 3 the drift angle responses of the two control frameworks are very similar but the lbc shows some small fluctuations because of fluctuation of the heading rate in course keeping in the plot of fig 8 the rudder angle time histories are displaced in course keeping the rudder angles of the proposed controller are smaller than those of lbc but rudder responses are bigger than lbc in course changing this is mainly because the proposed controller must compensate the relatively large drift angles to maintain its course tracking performance during sharp turns and this phenomenon does not affect the performance of the adaptive backstepping controller fig 9 depicts the rudder rate responses lbc gives more roughly chattering which can increase the wear and tear on the steering gear because the lbc cannot handle the time varying control gain i e internal disturbance problem case 2 compare with the adaptive backstepping controller abc without drift angles in order to specify that such drift angle errors cannot be minimised by only the heading controller we left out the drift angle model in eq 4 and considered the states x 1 ψ x 2 ψ and x 3 ψ i e β δ β 0 then we design the abc with the same process and parameters for comparison the simulation results are presented in figs 10 and 11 the drift angle under consideration is part of the heading control error clearly with similar rudder angle responses the abc w o drift angles cannot hold the stable heading error very well 5 conclusion in this study one concentrates on the course angle tracking problem of surface vessels an adaptive backstepping controller to steer a ship to follow the desired heading with time varying disturbances model uncertainties and control coefficient uncertainty has been proposed considering the drift angle based cascade state space nonlinear steering model the adaptive method is employed to approximate the un modelled dynamics and the upper bound of external disturbance the dsc technique was chosen to ease the derivative of virtual control laws and the nussbaum gain approach is applied to handle the control parameter uncertainty problem this controller does not require any knowledge of the nonlinear dynamics or internal uncertainty a second order pre filter is employed to smooth the predefined heading and this controller can guarantee that all states and errors in the closed loop system will be guub in comparison with the controller proposed by perera and soares 2013 and a heading only controller simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the further work it is of interest to consider the effects of time varying ship forward speed on the second order nonlinear heading model yaw motions due to steering can result in speed loss especially in sharp turns therefore we intend to investigate a novel adaptive robust heading controller

21887,in this paper a coordinated tracking strategy with swarm center identification self organized aggregation collision avoidance and distributed controller design for multiple unmanned surface vehicles usvs under complex marine environments including both unknown dynamics and external disturbances is presented for self organized aggregation and collision avoidance a velocity feedback control with the repulsive potential function is employed for each vehicle to match surge velocity and heading angle with its neighbors to keep all vehicles connected in a group a virtual swarm center sc is simultaneously designed and identified using a consensus algorithm thereby usvs have global knowledge of the desired trajectory aiming to precisely estimate completely unknown dynamics together with external disturbances a distributed tracking controller based wavelet neural network wnn is further proposed within the coordinated tracking strategy simulation studies and comprehensive comparisons with conventional nn demonstrate excellent performance of the swarm tracking strategy and superiority of wnn scheme keywords unmanned surface vehicles coordinated tracking velocity feedback control wavelet neural network swarm center 1 introduction compared with a single vehicle multiple unmanned surface vehicles usvs in ocean engineering fields such as environmental monitor marine secure and military applications have provided additional superiorities in terms of system flexibility efficiency and robustness fan et al 2019 in this context coordinated tracking for usvs to desired trajectories and desired formation configuration simultaneously has been an active subject in both marine engineering liu et al 2019 and control communities he et al 2019 unfortunately usvs in the presence of complex marine environments are frequently subject to communication losses ghabcheloo et al 2009 time delays liu et al 2015 and unknown uncertainties gao et al 2019 wang et al 2019a thereby causing great difficulties in coordinated tracking strategy by virtue of the leader follower approach many attractive researches for coordinated tracking have been presented due to its simplicity and reliability loria et al 2016 burlutskiy et al 2012 considering unknown disturbances followers are adopted the approximation based control technique which can track a desired trajectory based on the leader position and predefined formation cui et al 2010 under further conditions on limited communications a nonlinear filter for followers is employed to estimate the contaminated velocity information with multiple packet dropouts emrani et al 2011 combining with dynamic surface control dsc technique and neural network nn followers only depend on the position information of leader and thereby leading to a much simpler formation controller than traditional backstepping method peng et al 2013 furthermore coordinated tracking with respect to multiple leaders can be found in wang et al 2019b dong and hu 2017 li et al 2013 which is also called as containment control peng et al 2015 that followers converge to the convex hull spanned by the all leaders positions notarstefano et al 2011 however it is obvious in these literatures concerning coordinated tracking based on leader follower that followers must maintain a fixed configuration with the leader which inevitably suffers from the single point failure yu et al 2018 with an increasing number of vehicles more predefined information with respect to fixed formation pattern must be provided thereby enhancing the control system complexity and causing great difficulties in practical applications another constraint is that the information exchange in a networked system is restricted for limited communication distances therefore centralized control based leader follower certainly has a great limitation when large numbers of vehicles are involved in this coordinated system or other vehicles are added to the network in this respect distributed control based on neighbor information has been an open issue asadi et al 2016 hassanzadeh et al 2016 liang et al 2019a by virtue of artificial potential field apf oland and kristiansen 2013 liu and chopra 2013 coordinated tracking can be achieved by employing attractive force and repulsive force palacios et al 2015 ji et al 2017 which can drive vehicles based on neighbor positions however note that the dynamic control with unknown time varying disturbances is usually neglected which may not be adequate to analyze the practical dynamics and provide technology supports to deal with uncertain dynamics approximation based control approaches via nn gao et al 2017a he et al 2017 fuzzy systems liang et al 2018 2019b and fuzzy nn mu et al 2018 wang and er 2015 etc are found effective and widely adopted in marine vehicle system lakhekar and waghmare 2018 londhe and patre 2019 since these do not obtain accurate model parameters motivated by aforementioned discussions this paper further researches the coordinated tracking problem along one time varying trajectory for a group of underactuated usvs subject to complex marine environments including both unknown dynamics and external disturbances both aggregation scheme and separation scheme based on biological swarm behavior are designed at the first step to realize the coordinated tracking where usvs can communicate with each other under an undirected interaction topology the swarm center sc identification is simultaneously proposed by combining with swarm graph and consensus algorithm to implement swarm aggregation by virtue of wavelet neural network wnn technique the distributed controllers are developed to provide usvs control forces and moments eventually lyapunov based stability is proven and coordinated tracking errors of swarm system can be rendered to zero main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 in contrast to the centralized control of leader follower in cui et al 2010 emrani et al 2011 where a fixed formation configuration is designed the proposed coordinated tracking strategy is distributed and has unfixed configuration thereby providing great flexibility and expandability when some vehicles are added to the network or others are dropped out 2 to keep all vehicles connected in a group a virtual sc is designed and identified based on the consensus algorithm as a result usvs have global knowledge of the desired trajectory unlike the centralized information interaction each usv obtains accurate information from its neighbors which can relieve the communication burden of coordinated system 3 a distributed universe based wnn controller that combines nn learning ability and wavelet decomposition ability is proposed for dynamic control for each underactuated usv compared with the nn scheme proposed in peng et al 2013 the proposed scheme has more superiority to precisely identify both unknown dynamics and external disturbances the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the preliminaries and problem formulation a swarm coordinated scheme is developed in section 3 the adaptive universe based wnn controllers and stability analysis of the closed loop system are provided in section 4 simulations are carried out in section 5 and conclusion is finally stated in section 6 notations

horizontal plane can be described as 4 consider a swarm system composed of n vehicles the motion of the ith usv in 3 dof can be expressed using the following vectors 4 η i x i y i ψ i t v i u i v i r i t τ i τ u i 0 τ r i t where η i r 3 is a vector with x i y i being the ith usv position in the earth fixed frame and ψ i being the yaw angle v i r 3 is a velocity vector with u i being the surge velocity v i being the sway velocity and r i being the yaw angular velocity in the body fixed frame the control forces τ u i and moments τ r i are provided by the usv thruster system following the reference liang et al 2018 the kinematic and dynamic equations of motion can be written as 5 x i u i cos ψ i v i sin ψ i y i u i sin ψ i v i cos ψ i ψ i r i and 6 m 11 u i m 22 v i r i d 11 u i τ u i τ w u i m 22 v i m 11 u i r i d 22 v i 0 τ w v i m 33 r i m 11 m 22 u i v i d 33 r i τ r i τ w r i where m 11 m 22 m 33 d 11 d 22 d 33 represent the inertial masses and hydrodynamic damping in the corresponding freedom τ w u i τ w v i and τ w r i are external disturbances in surge sway and yaw directions in addition there is a virtual point called the sc in this coordinated system 7 η c 1 n i 1 n η i and the average distance from the ith vehicle to the sc is given by 8 σ 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 to describe the multi vehicle motion a swarm system function with distributed and self organized

distributed and self organized swarm control strategy for multiple usvs with uncertain dynamics and time varying disturbances such that swarm system can track the desired path described as 11 x d x d y d σ d t and the average distance can simultaneously converge to the desired distance σ d remark 1 in addition to position tracking convergence of average distance i e σ σ d is also implemented remark 2 it should be noted that each usv should maintain a certain distance between neighbors due to the unfixed formation structure thereby inter vehicle collision avoidance is essential 3 swarm coordinated scheme in this section the swarm coordinated scheme is created by sc identification swarm aggregation and swarm separation thereby facilitating the distributed controller design 3 1 swarm center identification for distributed control each vehicle has the ability to access its neighbors states η j j n i in order to implement swarm aggregation a consensus algorithm for the ith usv is derived to identify the position of actual sc as follows 12 η i c j n i η i c η j c η i η i c where η j c is the estimation for the jth usv in this case the virtual sc for swarm system can be expressed as 13 η c η l i η c where η c η 1 c η n c η η 1 η n theorem 1 consider a networked swarm system consisting of n usvs and consensus algorithm 13 the virtual sc can converge to the actual swarm center asymptotically i e 14 η i c 1 n i 1 n η i and η c η c proof based on 7 and swarm graph g υ ε the actual sc can be written as 15 η a v 1 n i i t η define sc errors as follows 16 ξ η a v η

organized aggregation in order to facilitate coordinated tracking successfully usvs are required to track the assigned trajectory with desired velocities together with 9 and 11 we get the swarm error dynamics as follows 24 x e x a c t x d e 1 e 2 e 3 t with e 1 x x d e 2 y y d e 3 σ σ d consider the lyapunov like function as follows 25 v 2 1 2 x e t x e taking the time derivate of 25 and using 9 yield 26 v 2 x e t j η v x d to make the swarm errors converge asymptotically the desired velocities are designed as follows 27 v d v d 1 t v d 2 t v d n t t j k 1 x e x d where k 1 d i a g k 11 k 22 k 33 v d i is the desired velocity for the ith usv and define v d i x d i y d i t j denotes the pseudo inverse of j which is employed by j j t j j t 1 and satisfies j j i 3 in what follows the desired velocity and heading angle for the ith vehicle are given by 28 u d i x d i 2 y d i 2 and ψ d i atan 2 y d i x d i substituting 27 into 25 yields 29 v 2 x e t j η j k 1 x e x d x d k 11 e 1 2 k 22 e 2 2 k 33 e 3 2 k v 2 v 2 where k v 2 2 min k 11 k 22 k 33 it follows from 29 that e 1 e 2 and e 3 are all bounded by the aid of barbalat s lemma wang et al 2019a the asymptotic stability is guaranteed i e 30 lim t x e 0 3 3 collision avoidance to avoid collision in the process of self organized aggregation a velocity feedback control with the repulsive potential function is employed within the swarm system the separation control function of the ith vehicle should include all repulsive forces from its neighbors consider a repulsive potential function u i j as follows 31 u i j r i j min 0 r i j 2 d 2 r i j 2 d 2 2 where i j 1 n and i j r i j η i η j is the euclidian distance between two vehicles d and d are critical communication distance and critical collision distance respectively and d d 0 is further satisfied the negative gradient of u i j is the repulsive force as follows 32 u i j p i 4 d 2 d 2 r i j 2 d 2 r i j 2 d 2 3 p i p j d r i j d 0 2 r i j d o r r i j d where p i x i y i t it is obviously seen that u i j is zero outside the communication area and is infinite at the edge of the collision area when r i j is less than d the control function will be activated in the additional control input therefore the separation control function of ca is designed as 33 u i 1 n j n i u i j r i j which leads to the desired velocities as follows 34 v d x e t k 1 j k 3 u η t t j x d k 3 u η j t k 1 x e j x d where k 3 0 since r i j d renders u i j r i j 0 it follows that there is no collision among usvs and sufficient safe distance is maintained the flowchart of proposed swarm coordinated scheme is presented in fig 1 the algorithm adopts self organized aggregation along with the assigned trajectory and ca method once r i j d is determined the algorithm starts to iterate to recalculate surge velocity and heading angle thereby facilitating appropriated control inputs in section 4 4 adaptive universe based wnn control the dynamics equation 6 can be written as follows 35 m i v i f i v i τ i where f i v i f u i f v i f r i t is the vector of uncertain dynamics as follows 36 f u i m 22 v r d 11 u f v i m 11 u r d 22 v f r i m 22 m 11 u v d 33 r since the coordinated tracking strategy is distributed and self organized an individual controller is designed for the ith vehicle in the following the uncertain dynamics can be exactly identified by a wnn with adaptive laws the estimation errors of uncertain dynamics are defined as follows 37 f f f ˆ by virtue of the universal approximation ability of wnn it follows that 38 f w t φ w ˆ t φ ˆ δ w w ˆ t φ φ ˆ w ˆ t φ

are uniformly ultimately bounded uub liu et al 2016 this concludes the proof 4 2 surge control based on the above strategy of self organized coordination the objective of surge control is 51 lim t u i

ρ 2 2 we have 60 v 4 k 1 1 2 ρ 2 2 u e i 2 1 m 11 u e i ε 2 k 1 u e i 2 1 2 u e i ρ 2 1 m 11 ρ 2 ε 2 2 1 2 m 11 2 ρ 2 2 ε 2 2 k 1 u e i 2 d 2 where ρ 2 0 d 2 1 2 m 11 2 ρ 2 2 ε 2 2 similarly we derive that v 4 0 via u e i 2 d 2 a 2 it follows that the error signals are uub this concludes the proof 4 3 stability analysis the surge and heading tracking error dynamics of multiple usvs are expressed by

with adaptive laws in 45 and 56 the usvs in 35 and 36 with uncertain dynamics any assigned trajectory can be tracked and tracking error signals are uub proof from theorems 2 and 3 we can directly observe that individual tracking errors of the ith vehicle is bounded in addition the sc algorithm 13 and the desired swarm velocities 27 render the consensus inputs including surge velocity and heading angle it follows that the error signals are uub this concludes the proof 5 simulation studies to demonstrate the validity and control performance of the proposed coordinated tracking strategy in this section simulation studies are performed for a swarm system consider a networked system consisting of six usvs with the model parameters given in table 1 and the desired trajectory x d y d generated as 62 i f t 80 x d 5 t 200 y d 5 t 200 e l s e i f 80 t 170 x d 200 cos π t 80 120 600 100 2 y d 200 sin π t 80 120 600 100 2 e l s e i f 170 t 250 x d 5 t 170 600 200 2 y d 5 t 170 600 200

the external disturbances caused by winds waves and ocean currents the simulated disturbances are generated using first order gauss markov processes 63 τ w u i ω 1 τ w u i ϑ 1 τ w v i ω 2 τ w v i ϑ 2 τ w r i ω 3 τ w r i ϑ 3 where ω i i 1 2 3 are zero mean gaussian white noise processes and ϑ i i 1 2 3 0 the initial dynamics is predefined as v i 0 0 0 t and kinematics is given by 64 η 1 200 50 0 65

parameters are selected as k 3 5 k r 0 4 k ψ 0 6 k u 2 d 20 d 30 σ d 50 the uncertain dynamics f r i and f u i can be exactly identified by two wnn with φ x x exp 1 2 x 2 and adaptive laws 45 56 in addition wnn structure can be found in sung et al 2006 and network parameters are as follows l 10 η 1 η 2 5 d i k 0 8 and ω i k 1 for i 1 10 the simulation results are shown in figs 2 8 it is clear from figs 2 6 that six usvs are able to track the desired trajectory with rapid response and high accuracy in addition there are no collisions between usvs with proposed ca method snapshots of the swarm performance corresponding to fig 2 are shown in fig 3 where little circles are the positions at a certain time and five pointed star represents the sc to clearly observe the vehicle position in fig 3 distances among usvs are calculated and shown in table 2 it can also be seen that r i j d 20 is guaranteed by the aid of proposed coordinated scheme fig 4 demonstrates the swarm errors and the average distance from the six vehicles to the sc can converge to the desired value under the controller given by 43 45 55 and 56 which confirms the conclusions in theorem 4 fig 5 shows the surge velocities and the heading angles for six usvs fig 6 shows the control forces and moments for six usvs the outputs of the proposed sc identification are plotted in fig 7 it shows that each vehicle could identify the position of actual sc within 40s to demonstrate the superiority of the wnn control scheme the actual and estimated uncertain dynamics are shown in fig 8 from which we can see that the proposed wnn control scheme can approximate the unknowns with high accuracy than the nn control scheme in peng et al 2013 6 conclusion in this paper coordinated tracking problem of multiple usvs with complex marine environments has been addressed by devising a swarm tracking strategy swarm behaviors with self organized aggregation and collision avoidance have been employed using the velocity feedback control in addition the sc identification has achieved virtual center estimation and thereby not only enhancing swarm tracking performance but also avoiding the limitation of fixed formation configuration combining backsteppping technique and wnn approach robust distributed controllers have been proposed to render the closed loop tracking error uub and thereby contributing to the

21887,in this paper a coordinated tracking strategy with swarm center identification self organized aggregation collision avoidance and distributed controller design for multiple unmanned surface vehicles usvs under complex marine environments including both unknown dynamics and external disturbances is presented for self organized aggregation and collision avoidance a velocity feedback control with the repulsive potential function is employed for each vehicle to match surge velocity and heading angle with its neighbors to keep all vehicles connected in a group a virtual swarm center sc is simultaneously designed and identified using a consensus algorithm thereby usvs have global knowledge of the desired trajectory aiming to precisely estimate completely unknown dynamics together with external disturbances a distributed tracking controller based wavelet neural network wnn is further proposed within the coordinated tracking strategy simulation studies and comprehensive comparisons with conventional nn demonstrate excellent performance of the swarm tracking strategy and superiority of wnn scheme keywords unmanned surface vehicles coordinated tracking velocity feedback control wavelet neural network swarm center 1 introduction compared with a single vehicle multiple unmanned surface vehicles usvs in ocean engineering fields such as environmental monitor marine secure and military applications have provided additional superiorities in terms of system flexibility efficiency and robustness fan et al 2019 in this context coordinated tracking for usvs to desired trajectories and desired formation configuration simultaneously has been an active subject in both marine engineering liu et al 2019 and control communities he et al 2019 unfortunately usvs in the presence of complex marine environments are frequently subject to communication losses ghabcheloo et al 2009 time delays liu et al 2015 and unknown uncertainties gao et al 2019 wang et al 2019a thereby causing great difficulties in coordinated tracking strategy by virtue of the leader follower approach many attractive researches for coordinated tracking have been presented due to its simplicity and reliability loria et al 2016 burlutskiy et al 2012 considering unknown disturbances followers are adopted the approximation based control technique which can track a desired trajectory based on the leader position and predefined formation cui et al 2010 under further conditions on limited communications a nonlinear filter for followers is employed to estimate the contaminated velocity information with multiple packet dropouts emrani et al 2011 combining with dynamic surface control dsc technique and neural network nn followers only depend on the position information of leader and thereby leading to a much simpler formation controller than traditional backstepping method peng et al 2013 furthermore coordinated tracking with respect to multiple leaders can be found in wang et al 2019b dong and hu 2017 li et al 2013 which is also called as containment control peng et al 2015 that followers converge to the convex hull spanned by the all leaders positions notarstefano et al 2011 however it is obvious in these literatures concerning coordinated tracking based on leader follower that followers must maintain a fixed configuration with the leader which inevitably suffers from the single point failure yu et al 2018 with an increasing number of vehicles more predefined information with respect to fixed formation pattern must be provided thereby enhancing the control system complexity and causing great difficulties in practical applications another constraint is that the information exchange in a networked system is restricted for limited communication distances therefore centralized control based leader follower certainly has a great limitation when large numbers of vehicles are involved in this coordinated system or other vehicles are added to the network in this respect distributed control based on neighbor information has been an open issue asadi et al 2016 hassanzadeh et al 2016 liang et al 2019a by virtue of artificial potential field apf oland and kristiansen 2013 liu and chopra 2013 coordinated tracking can be achieved by employing attractive force and repulsive force palacios et al 2015 ji et al 2017 which can drive vehicles based on neighbor positions however note that the dynamic control with unknown time varying disturbances is usually neglected which may not be adequate to analyze the practical dynamics and provide technology supports to deal with uncertain dynamics approximation based control approaches via nn gao et al 2017a he et al 2017 fuzzy systems liang et al 2018 2019b and fuzzy nn mu et al 2018 wang and er 2015 etc are found effective and widely adopted in marine vehicle system lakhekar and waghmare 2018 londhe and patre 2019 since these do not obtain accurate model parameters motivated by aforementioned discussions this paper further researches the coordinated tracking problem along one time varying trajectory for a group of underactuated usvs subject to complex marine environments including both unknown dynamics and external disturbances both aggregation scheme and separation scheme based on biological swarm behavior are designed at the first step to realize the coordinated tracking where usvs can communicate with each other under an undirected interaction topology the swarm center sc identification is simultaneously proposed by combining with swarm graph and consensus algorithm to implement swarm aggregation by virtue of wavelet neural network wnn technique the distributed controllers are developed to provide usvs control forces and moments eventually lyapunov based stability is proven and coordinated tracking errors of swarm system can be rendered to zero main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 in contrast to the centralized control of leader follower in cui et al 2010 emrani et al 2011 where a fixed formation configuration is designed the proposed coordinated tracking strategy is distributed and has unfixed configuration thereby providing great flexibility and expandability when some vehicles are added to the network or others are dropped out 2 to keep all vehicles connected in a group a virtual sc is designed and identified based on the consensus algorithm as a result usvs have global knowledge of the desired trajectory unlike the centralized information interaction each usv obtains accurate information from its neighbors which can relieve the communication burden of coordinated system 3 a distributed universe based wnn controller that combines nn learning ability and wavelet decomposition ability is proposed for dynamic control for each underactuated usv compared with the nn scheme proposed in peng et al 2013 the proposed scheme has more superiority to precisely identify both unknown dynamics and external disturbances the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the preliminaries and problem formulation a swarm coordinated scheme is developed in section 3 the adaptive universe based wnn controllers and stability analysis of the closed loop system are provided in section 4 simulations are carried out in section 5 and conclusion is finally stated in section 6 notations

horizontal plane can be described as 4 consider a swarm system composed of n vehicles the motion of the ith usv in 3 dof can be expressed using the following vectors 4 η i x i y i ψ i t v i u i v i r i t τ i τ u i 0 τ r i t where η i r 3 is a vector with x i y i being the ith usv position in the earth fixed frame and ψ i being the yaw angle v i r 3 is a velocity vector with u i being the surge velocity v i being the sway velocity and r i being the yaw angular velocity in the body fixed frame the control forces τ u i and moments τ r i are provided by the usv thruster system following the reference liang et al 2018 the kinematic and dynamic equations of motion can be written as 5 x i u i cos ψ i v i sin ψ i y i u i sin ψ i v i cos ψ i ψ i r i and 6 m 11 u i m 22 v i r i d 11 u i τ u i

corresponding freedom τ w u i τ w v i and τ w r i are external disturbances in surge sway and yaw directions in addition there is a virtual point called the sc in this coordinated system 7 η c 1 n i 1 n η i and the average distance from the ith vehicle to the sc is given by 8 σ 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 to describe the multi vehicle motion a swarm system function with distributed and self organized

distributed and self organized swarm control strategy for multiple usvs with uncertain dynamics and time varying disturbances such that swarm system can track the desired path described as 11 x d x d y d σ d t and the average distance can simultaneously converge to the desired distance σ d remark 1 in addition to position tracking convergence of average distance i e σ σ d is also implemented remark 2 it should be noted that each usv should maintain a certain distance between neighbors due to the unfixed formation structure thereby inter vehicle collision avoidance is essential 3 swarm coordinated scheme in this section the swarm coordinated scheme is created by sc identification swarm aggregation and swarm separation thereby facilitating the distributed controller design 3 1 swarm center identification for distributed control each vehicle has the ability to access its neighbors states η j j n i in order to implement swarm aggregation a consensus algorithm for the ith usv is derived to identify the position of actual sc as follows 12 η i c j n i η i c η j c η i η i c where η j c is the estimation for the jth usv in this case the virtual sc for swarm system can be expressed as 13 η c η l i η c where η c η 1 c η n c η η 1 η n theorem 1 consider a networked swarm system consisting of n usvs and consensus algorithm 13 the virtual sc can converge to the actual swarm center asymptotically i e 14 η i c 1 n i 1 n η i and η c η c proof based on 7 and swarm graph g υ ε the actual sc can be written as 15 η a v 1 n i i t η define sc errors as follows 16 ξ η a v η

organized aggregation in order to facilitate coordinated tracking successfully usvs are required to track the assigned trajectory with desired velocities together with 9 and 11 we get the swarm error dynamics as follows 24 x e x a c t x d e 1 e 2 e 3 t with e 1 x x d e 2 y y d e 3 σ σ d consider the lyapunov like function as follows 25 v 2 1 2 x e t x e taking the time derivate of 25 and using 9 yield 26 v 2 x e t j η v x d to make the swarm errors converge asymptotically the desired velocities are designed as follows 27 v d v d 1 t v d 2 t v d n t t j k 1 x e x d where k 1 d i a g k 11 k 22 k 33 v d i is the desired velocity for the ith usv and define v d i x d i y d i t j denotes the pseudo inverse of j which is employed by j j t j j t 1 and satisfies j j i 3 in what follows the desired velocity and heading angle for the ith vehicle are given by 28 u d i x d i 2 y d i 2 and ψ d i atan 2 y d i x d i substituting 27 into 25 yields 29 v 2 x e t j η j k 1 x e x d x d k 11 e 1 2 k 22 e 2 2 k 33 e 3 2 k v 2 v 2 where k v 2 2 min k 11 k 22 k 33 it follows from 29 that e 1 e 2 and e 3 are all bounded by the aid of barbalat s lemma wang et al 2019a the asymptotic stability is guaranteed i e 30 lim t x e 0 3 3 collision avoidance to avoid collision in the process of self organized aggregation a velocity feedback control with the repulsive potential function is employed within the swarm system the separation control function of the ith vehicle should include all repulsive forces from its neighbors consider a repulsive potential function u i j as follows 31 u i j r i j min 0 r i j 2 d 2 r i j 2 d 2 2 where i j 1 n and i j r i j η i η j is the euclidian distance between two vehicles d and d are critical communication distance and critical collision distance respectively and d d 0 is further satisfied the negative gradient of u i j is the repulsive force as follows 32 u i j p i 4 d 2 d 2 r i j 2 d 2 r i j 2 d 2 3 p i p j d r i j d 0 2 r i j d o r r i j d where p i x i y i t it is obviously seen that u i j is zero outside the communication area and is infinite at the edge of the collision area when r i j is less than d the control function will be activated in the additional control input therefore the separation control function of ca is designed as 33 u i 1 n j n i u i j r i j which leads to the desired velocities as follows 34 v d x e t k 1 j k 3 u η t t j x d k 3 u η j t k 1 x e j x d where k 3 0 since r i j d renders u i j r i j 0 it follows that there is no collision among usvs and sufficient safe distance is maintained the flowchart of proposed swarm coordinated scheme is presented in fig 1 the algorithm adopts self organized aggregation along with the assigned trajectory and ca method once r i j d is determined the algorithm starts to iterate to recalculate surge velocity and heading angle thereby facilitating appropriated control inputs in section 4 4 adaptive universe based wnn control the dynamics equation 6 can be written as follows 35 m

tracking strategy is distributed and self organized an individual controller is designed for the ith vehicle in the following the uncertain dynamics can be exactly identified by a wnn with adaptive laws the estimation errors of uncertain dynamics are defined as follows 37 f f f ˆ by virtue of the universal approximation ability of wnn it follows that 38 f w t φ w ˆ t φ ˆ δ w w ˆ t φ φ ˆ w ˆ t φ

that v 4 0 via u e i 2 d 2 a 2 it follows that the error signals are uub this concludes the proof 4 3 stability analysis the surge and heading tracking error dynamics of multiple usvs are expressed by

with adaptive laws in 45 and 56 the usvs in 35 and 36 with uncertain dynamics any assigned trajectory can be tracked and tracking error signals are uub proof from theorems 2 and 3 we can directly observe that individual tracking errors of the ith vehicle is bounded in addition the sc algorithm 13 and the desired swarm velocities 27 render the consensus inputs including surge velocity and heading angle it follows that the error signals are uub this concludes the proof 5 simulation studies to demonstrate the validity and control performance of the proposed coordinated tracking strategy in this section simulation studies are performed for a swarm system consider a networked system consisting of six usvs with the model parameters given in table 1 and the desired trajectory x d y d

addition wnn structure can be found in sung et al 2006 and network parameters are as follows l 10 η 1 η 2 5 d i k 0 8 and ω i k 1 for i 1 10 the simulation results are shown in figs 2 8 it is clear from figs 2 6 that six usvs are able to track the desired trajectory with rapid response and high accuracy in addition there are no collisions between usvs with proposed ca method snapshots of the swarm performance corresponding to fig 2 are shown in fig 3 where little circles are the positions at a certain time and five pointed star represents the sc to clearly observe the vehicle position in fig 3 distances among usvs are calculated and shown in table 2 it can also be seen that r i j d 20 is guaranteed by the aid of proposed coordinated scheme fig 4 demonstrates the swarm errors and the average distance from the six vehicles to the sc can converge to the desired value under the controller given by 43 45 55 and 56 which confirms the conclusions in theorem 4 fig 5 shows the surge velocities and the heading angles for six usvs fig 6 shows the control forces and moments for six usvs the outputs of the proposed sc identification are plotted in fig 7 it shows that each vehicle could identify the position of actual sc within 40s to demonstrate the superiority of the wnn control scheme the actual and estimated uncertain dynamics are shown in fig 8 from which we can see that the proposed wnn control scheme can approximate the unknowns with high accuracy than the nn control scheme in peng et al 2013 6 conclusion in this paper coordinated tracking problem of multiple usvs with complex marine environments has been addressed by devising a swarm tracking strategy swarm behaviors with self organized aggregation and collision avoidance have been employed using the velocity feedback control in addition the sc identification has achieved virtual center estimation and thereby not only enhancing swarm tracking performance but also avoiding the limitation of fixed formation configuration combining backsteppping technique and wnn approach robust distributed controllers have been proposed to render the closed loop tracking error uub and thereby contributing to the

21888,a long short term memory lstm network is proposed for the quick prediction of significant wave height with higher accuracy than conventional neural network the lstm network is used for 1 h and 6 h predictions at ten stations with different environmental conditions using the wind speed of the past 4 h and the wave height and wind direction of the past 1 h as input parameters the lstm prediction results were obtained and compared with results from a back propagation neural network extreme learning machine support vector machine residual network and random forest algorithm five statistical indicators were used to evaluate the results comprehensively the minimum mean absolute error percentage of the 1 h and 6 h forecasts was 5 14 and 5 24 respectively the results demonstrate that the lstm can achieve stable prediction effects with accurate 1 h predictions and satisfactory 6 h predictions in addition predictions for four time spans namely 12 h 1 day 2 days and 3 days were determined for station 41008 the results show the powerful ability of lstm to perform long term prediction the simulating waves nearshore lstm swan lstm model was proposed to make a single point prediction and it outperformed the standard swan model with an improvement in accuracy of over 65 keywords significant wave height prediction long short term memory support vector machines machine learning swan lstm 1 introduction wave height is an important design parameter in coastal and marine engineering design wave conditions impact various marine activities and have important implications for national security therefore the prediction of wave height has always been a matter of particular concern jain et al 2011 jain and deo 2006 deo et al 2001 however it is difficult to make accurate predictions due to the stochastic nature of ocean waves semi analytic methods were initially used for effective wave height prediction including the sverdroup munk bretscheider method and pierson neumann james method however they were unable to describe the sea surface wave conditions in detail numerical models are the most widely used approach to wave prediction however when computing large models high performance computers and significant time costs are required due to the large amount of data and the complexity of the calculations wang et al 2018 etemad shahidi and mahjoobi 2009 numerical computations may not be reliable in emergency scenarios that require quick results with the development of machine learning image recognition technology is applied to atmospheric observation an et al 2020 pradhan et al 2018 yang et al 2019a 2019b artificial neural network ann models are being applied to wave height prediction for example deo and sridhar naidu 1998 proposed a feedforward network to predict sea wave height in real time compared with the autoregressive model their method demonstrated a more general flexible and adaptable capability mandal and prabaharan 2006 used a recurrent neural network rnn for wave height prediction and found that the correlation coefficient of rnn is higher than that of the feedforward network mahjoobi and adeli mosabbeb 2009 attempted to use an support vector machine svm to predict wave height the results showed that the svm model had acceptable accuracy and required less computational time compared to an ann model etemad shahidi and mahjoobi 2009 conducted various studies on prediction effects in lake superior and compared model trees and feedforward back propagation anns the results showed that the model tree method was more accurate and provided formulas of wind speed and wave height dixit et al 2015 found the phenomenon of prediction time lag while using anns to predict ocean wave height this compromised the predictions therefore the authors used a discrete wavelet transform to enhance the predicted values and removed the lag in the prediction timing alexandre et al 2015 applied a hybrid genetic algorithm extreme learning machine approach to reconstruct the wave height this approach was confirmed to be effective in recovering lost wave data from buoys krishna kumar et al 2017 conducted a series of comparative experiments using different neutral networks and by taking into account the differences in geographic locations the results showed that the minimal resource allocation network has a better structure and stronger adaptability in different conditions wang et al 2018 used a hybrid mind evolutionary algorithm bp neural network to simulate the ocean wave height this approach can provide results quickly at the expense of a certain precision in addition this method outperformed other neural networks wherein less meteorological data was available akbarifard and radmanesh 2018 proposed the symbiotic organisms search sos algorithm to predict ocean wave heights in two time ranges based on a large number of accurate meteorological data including measured wave heights by buoys the performance of the sos algorithm was better than that of the support vector regression ann and simulating waves nearshore swan dynamic models the researchers also introduced a hybrid swan sos model to modify the numerical model and obtained remarkable results londhe et al 2016 built a coupled numerical and ann model which reduced the prediction error by transferring the real error to the neural network james et al 2018 developed a machine learning framework based on the swan model to predict the wave height and period in monterey bay california this framework improved the accuracy of the swan model one of the time recurrent neural networks proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is the long short term memory lstm network lstm does not require special complexity to debug hyperparameters and it can choose to remember or forget long term information through a forget gate graves et al 2009 used lstm to improve handwriting recognition ability which outperformed the hidden markov model sundermeyer et al 2012 improved the modeling and recognition of different language analyses by lstm in addition lstm is widely used in controlling robots predicting diseases analysing stocks and synthesizing music pirhooshyaran and snyder 2019 applied the lstm neural network frameworks for ocean wave data reconstruction when the number of target features is large a deeper structure can improve performance previous studies were dedicated to using different classification algorithms and feedforward neural networks hybrid models and feature selection schemes to improve prediction results but most of the proposed models were only tested in a small range and short prediction time classification algorithm and feedforward neural network are not the best choice for time series analysis hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 but no scholar has used the lstm that a tool suitable for time series analysis to do this work the wave sequence that an important time series is consistent with the characteristics of lstm as it constantly remembers new information and considers the impact of old information therefore this paper presents the use of lstm to predict the wave height at different stations and a comparison of the results with those from back propagation neural network bpnn extreme learning machine elm svm residual network resnet and random forest rf algorithm section

areas and materials in order to test the stability and reliability of lstm we selected ten stations with different water depths and different environmental conditions the hourly data measured by moored ocean buoys was used for significant wave height swh prediction the ten stations were selected from across the world hurricane times were included in the data period so the impact of different wind speeds was included in this research from the data obtained from the stations different data quantities were selected to evaluate the demand for data by different algorithms the data was collected from two sources the national oceanic and atmospheric administration http www ndbc noaa gov and the european marine observation and data network http www emodnet physics eu map the details of the ten stations are provided in table 1 and their distribution is shown in fig 1 the influence factors of the wave height are the previous wave height sea surface temperature sea temperature wind direction wind speed and pressure the main influence factors are the previous wave height wind direction and wind speed hashim et al 2016 fernández et al 2015 nitsure et al 2012 kamranzad et al 2011

y σ x σ y 1 n i 1 n x i x y i y 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 unrecorded features and useless features are removed and the correlation of each feature is represented in fig 2 since the ocean wave is a strong nonlinear process the linear relationship among historical features is weak thus features with positive correlation are selected as input features which include wd wspd1 wspd2 wspd3 wspd4 and wvht1 3 long short term memory prediction model rnn were developed in the 1980s the main application of rnn is in the processing and prediction of sequence data however rnn suffer from the problems of exploding and vanishing gradient the lstm network has a significant advantage over the traditional rnn network which is the forget gate thus lstm solves the problem faced by traditional rnn and learns faster by adding a self loop method to generate a long term continuous flow path the structure diagram of the lstm is shown in fig 3 for an input sequence x i an x value may affect the output of a long term or spatially distant h j the training process learns the quantitative relationship of the influence the form of lstm is similar to a square matrix in which the middle part is the lstm unit except for the input x t and output h t the lstm unit is connected end to end the same layer uses the output of the previous unit as the input to the latter unit the output of the previous layer is used as the input to the next layer and finally the output is obtained a schematic diagram of the lstm unit is presented in fig 4 c t is the main message passed between the steps and the horizontal line in fig 4 can be regarded as the main road of the lstm by adding c t can be transmitted over the main road without any obstacles therefore the far gradient can also be transmitted over long distances this is the core idea of lstm however the information c t at each step does not completely copy the previous step of c t 1 but forgets some content and remembers some new content based on c t 1 each unit in the lstm has a forget gate that controls some parts of c t 1 that are forgotten σ is the activation function of a sigmoid which can be expressed as in eq 2 its output lies between 0 and 1 2 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f the output of the final forget gate is a matrix of the same shape as c t 1 this matrix is multiplied by c t 1 if the sigmoid function outputs 1 then it is completely remembered the output 0 is completely forgotten and the value in the middle is the ratio of memory the input of the forgetting gate is x t and h t 1 x t is the input of the current moment and h t 1 is the hidden state of the previous moment w f and b f are undetermined coefficients for training learning the lstm unit remembers new things through the memory gate the input of the memory gate is x t and h t 1 its output is i t and ĉ t which are presented in eqs 3 and 4 3 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 4 c ˆ t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c the variate i t can be obtained using the sigmoid function and the output values are between 0 and 1 the remembered values are obtained via the dot product of ĉ t and i t w i b i w c and b c need to be learned through error back propagation training after the forget gate and memory gate c t can be calculated by eq 5 this formula determines how much of the output c t adopts the information entered this time and how much it adopts the information left over from the previous one 5 c t f t c t 1 i t c ˆ t the output gate is used to output the content based on x t and h t 1 each value in o t is between 0 and 1 and the expression is 6 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o after all the parameters are calculated the value of h t that was passed to the next unit can be calculated by 7 h t o t tanh c t with the storage and modification of status information the lstm unit can achieve long range memory 4 simulation and discussion the parameters of six algorithms are listed in table 2 s 0 is the number of input layer units s 1 is the number of hidden layer units s 2

num is the number of trees in rf and maxdep is the maximum depth of each tree in this section in order to evaluate the prediction effects of different neural networks we randomly divide the samples of the ten stations into three categories 64 training samples 16 verification samples and 20 test samples this paper predicted the swh after 1 h and 6 h in order to reflect the prediction effect the evaluation index of the correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae mean absolute error percentage mape and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used these are

prediction tables 3 and 4 list the test results of the six algorithms at different stations after training verification and testing and the optimal results are shown in bold in these tables it can be seen from the results that the dispersion of elm and svm is too large to apply and predict the swh while the results of bp resnet and rf appeared to fluctuate at some stations and the stability was poor mae and the mape of lstm were at the lowest level all the time and the mape was as low as 0 0514 r 2 was at a high level up to 0 9804 except for station 31052 where r 2 was 0 8127 the main reason is that the swh of this station always changed stepwise against time and there was no steady wave height increase or wave height drop state thus all algorithms calculated a lower r 2 however mae and the mape of lstm were still at very low levels mape of station 61198 with the least data was much higher than that of other stations however most indicators of lstm were better than those of the other algorithms overall this shows a wide applicability of lstm fig 5 shows a comparison between the observed and predicted values by lstm in an hourly time range the data points are concentrated near the bisector the linear fitting of the data points is similar to the bisector which indicates that the lstm algorithm can obtain higher precision prediction results in different sea areas and at different wave height range stations in fig 6 a comparison between the observed data and the six algorithms is presented because elm and svm are sensitive to the selection of parameters gu et al 2017 yan et al 2016 this makes it easy to fall into the local minimum point and leads to overfitting and underfitting thus elm and svm are not suitable for predicting time series data we can clearly see that the volatility of elm and svm is too large during the training process the lstm gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 therefore lstm works well over a broad range of parameters which no need for parameter fine tuning the approximation of lstm and observation data is the highest at all stations the results of the other algorithms are inaccurate and exhibit low stability at some stations the lstm based on an appropriate gradient based learning algorithm which performed good processing on noisy data such as at station 31052 fig 7 demonstrates the effect of lstm on continuous prediction at station 31052 and station 61198 this indicates that the lstm algorithm has high accuracy and wide applicability in continuous prediction 4 2 six hour swh prediction tables 5 and 6 list the 6 h swh prediction results and the optimal results are shown in bold in these tables increasing the prediction time leads to a decrease in the validity of the data but lstm increases the filtering of the past state to improve the prediction effect through its recurrent structure and gate mechanism so it can choose which state has more influence on the current rather than simply choose the latest state due to a reduction in data correlation all mae and mape increased however the error was within the acceptable range station 41010 has the best prediction results mape was 0 0641 and r 2 was 0 9703 when the amount of data was less than 1 5 years the increase in mape and mae from the 1 h prediction to the 6 h prediction was larger while the increase was smaller when the data was for more than 1 5 years the magnitude of the increase in error at different stations was different however most indicators of lstm of all stations were better than those of the other algorithms overall which shows lstm was the most stable algorithm most 1 h prediction indicators of station 44007 and 51000 are not the optimal value in tables 3 and 4 but most indicators of ten stations are the best in 6 h prediction as shown in tables 5 and 6 compared with the 1 h prediction effect the number of optimal values of mae rmse and nse increases which shows the ability of lstm in 6 h prediction fig 8 shows a comparison between the observed and predicted values by lstm at every 6 h as the forecast period grows the correlation between the data decreases but lstm can remember much longer period information through its recurrent structure and gating mechanisms xiao et al 2019 the degree of data dispersion is slightly higher than that of 1 h the number of data points with large deviations is lower which shows the results of the lstm algorithm are meaningful fig 9 demonstrates that the lstm algorithm can achieve better prediction results when the wave height is increased reduced and smooth although the location of the stations is widely distributed and the prediction period increases the results of lstm and the observation data fit well the 6 h prediction nse of lstm are all optimal value at ten stations and its performance is better than that of 1 h prediction which shows the powerful generalization capabilities of lstm the effects of lstm on the 6 h wave height prediction at station 41010 and station 51000 are presented in fig 10 for comparison the forecast results of lstm on the 1 h prediction are also illustrated in fig 10 the 1 h prediction results are more consistent with real data than the 6 h results the variation range of 1 h prediction results is much acceptable than those of the 6 h results although the 6 h prediction results are slightly larger at some data points the overall prediction is basically consistent with the measured data which demonstrates the feasibility of lstm in long term swh prediction even for the prediction of 6 h time span 4 3 long term span swh prediction as the scope and complexity of the field of ocean engineering increases the need for longer term swh prediction also increases this paper randomly selects a station with a large amount of data to analyse the prediction ability of lstm station 41008 was used for 12 h 1 day 2 day and 3 day swh prediction table 7 lists the test results for different time spans it can be seen that mae mape and rmse increase continuously while r 2 and nse decrease gradually with an increase in the time span the higher mae is mainly owing to the larger average swh of this station mape is an important indicator that reflects the prediction effect mape of lstm is better than that of sos which was used by akbarifard and radmanesh 2018 an increase in the time interval reduces the correlation coefficient and the accuracy of prediction fig 11 shows the continuous prediction results for four time spans the maximum error of the 12 h prediction result is 0 31 m which is acceptable in 12 h prediction the approximate effect of the 1 day prediction result and the measured data is sufficient only a few points have large errors and the overall prediction effect is satisfactory there is an obvious lag in the 2 day prediction results which have an overestimation effect on the smaller swh however the overall trend is similar to that of the real data the prediction hysteresis is serious and the data fitting effect is poor in the 3 day prediction results the accuracy of prediction should be improved by selecting the appropriate input items 4 4 swan lstm swh prediction method swan is the most commonly used numerical model for simulating ocean wave height and wind speed however when the wind speed and the wave height are high the simulation results are conservative and the error is large montoya et al 2013 therefore we propose a swan lstm method in which the wind direction and wind speed in the last 4 h and the swan simulated wave height are selected as swan lstm input conditions and the lstm method was adopted to revise the data calculated by swan fig 12 shows a comparison between swan swan lstm and the observed data we can clearly see that the trend of swan prediction data is the same as that of the observation data but with a large overall error the same trend can be achieved with swan lstm and the fitting effect is good mae of swan is 1 0969 while that of swan lstm is only 0 3564 the accuracy increased by 67 5 mape of swan is 0 4126 and that of swan lstm is only 0 1395 this accuracy increased by 66 2 therefore the swan lstm model shows higher accuracy and strong applicability in single point prediction 5 conclusions lstm uses historical information to assist with current decisions through the mechanism of a forget gate it can choose to remember or forget long term information even if the information is complex there will be no long term dependence xiao et al 2019 applied an lstm adaboost combination approach for short and midterm surface temperature prediction this solved the overfitting problem and the results improved because lstm has a strong advantage in time series data prediction we chose it to predict swh in this paper we used 6 algorithms to predict the swh at ten different stations with different ocean environmental conditions five indicators were utilized to evaluate the accuracy and stability of the prediction results the results showed that the lstm algorithm can achieve more accurate results in 1 h and 6 h prediction by multiple criteria all of the prediction results demonstrated that lstm outperforms five other algorithms lstm also showed good stability for prediction effects in the two time ranges we can use lstm to supplement missing buoy data which can aid wave sequence continuity analysis the 6 h wave height predictions are acceptable and can be of help to fisheries and offshore engineering projects since the amount of data has a large impact on the forecasting results we recommend using at least 1 year of data for 1 h predictions and 2 years of data for 6 h predictions when analysing stations with different data volumes moreover predictions for four time spans 12 h 1 day 2 days and 3 days were accomplished for station 41008 the results showed the powerful ability of lstm to perform long term prediction a swan lstm model was applied to make a single point prediction and was found to be 65 more accurate than the standard swan model now that the prediction of short term swh can be achieved accurately future work will combine wind speed forecasting models with lstm models to improve the accuracy of long term swh prediction in addition a swan lstm model for a large scale significant wave height simulation will

21888,a long short term memory lstm network is proposed for the quick prediction of significant wave height with higher accuracy than conventional neural network the lstm network is used for 1 h and 6 h predictions at ten stations with different environmental conditions using the wind speed of the past 4 h and the wave height and wind direction of the past 1 h as input parameters the lstm prediction results were obtained and compared with results from a back propagation neural network extreme learning machine support vector machine residual network and random forest algorithm five statistical indicators were used to evaluate the results comprehensively the minimum mean absolute error percentage of the 1 h and 6 h forecasts was 5 14 and 5 24 respectively the results demonstrate that the lstm can achieve stable prediction effects with accurate 1 h predictions and satisfactory 6 h predictions in addition predictions for four time spans namely 12 h 1 day 2 days and 3 days were determined for station 41008 the results show the powerful ability of lstm to perform long term prediction the simulating waves nearshore lstm swan lstm model was proposed to make a single point prediction and it outperformed the standard swan model with an improvement in accuracy of over 65 keywords significant wave height prediction long short term memory support vector machines machine learning swan lstm 1 introduction wave height is an important design parameter in coastal and marine engineering design wave conditions impact various marine activities and have important implications for national security therefore the prediction of wave height has always been a matter of particular concern jain et al 2011 jain and deo 2006 deo et al 2001 however it is difficult to make accurate predictions due to the stochastic nature of ocean waves semi analytic methods were initially used for effective wave height prediction including the sverdroup munk bretscheider method and pierson neumann james method however they were unable to describe the sea surface wave conditions in detail numerical models are the most widely used approach to wave prediction however when computing large models high performance computers and significant time costs are required due to the large amount of data and the complexity of the calculations wang et al 2018 etemad shahidi and mahjoobi 2009 numerical computations may not be reliable in emergency scenarios that require quick results with the development of machine learning image recognition technology is applied to atmospheric observation an et al 2020 pradhan et al 2018 yang et al 2019a 2019b artificial neural network ann models are being applied to wave height prediction for example deo and sridhar naidu 1998 proposed a feedforward network to predict sea wave height in real time compared with the autoregressive model their method demonstrated a more general flexible and adaptable capability mandal and prabaharan 2006 used a recurrent neural network rnn for wave height prediction and found that the correlation coefficient of rnn is higher than that of the feedforward network mahjoobi and adeli mosabbeb 2009 attempted to use an support vector machine svm to predict wave height the results showed that the svm model had acceptable accuracy and required less computational time compared to an ann model etemad shahidi and mahjoobi 2009 conducted various studies on prediction effects in lake superior and compared model trees and feedforward back propagation anns the results showed that the model tree method was more accurate and provided formulas of wind speed and wave height dixit et al 2015 found the phenomenon of prediction time lag while using anns to predict ocean wave height this compromised the predictions therefore the authors used a discrete wavelet transform to enhance the predicted values and removed the lag in the prediction timing alexandre et al 2015 applied a hybrid genetic algorithm extreme learning machine approach to reconstruct the wave height this approach was confirmed to be effective in recovering lost wave data from buoys krishna kumar et al 2017 conducted a series of comparative experiments using different neutral networks and by taking into account the differences in geographic locations the results showed that the minimal resource allocation network has a better structure and stronger adaptability in different conditions wang et al 2018 used a hybrid mind evolutionary algorithm bp neural network to simulate the ocean wave height this approach can provide results quickly at the expense of a certain precision in addition this method outperformed other neural networks wherein less meteorological data was available akbarifard and radmanesh 2018 proposed the symbiotic organisms search sos algorithm to predict ocean wave heights in two time ranges based on a large number of accurate meteorological data including measured wave heights by buoys the performance of the sos algorithm was better than that of the support vector regression ann and simulating waves nearshore swan dynamic models the researchers also introduced a hybrid swan sos model to modify the numerical model and obtained remarkable results londhe et al 2016 built a coupled numerical and ann model which reduced the prediction error by transferring the real error to the neural network james et al 2018 developed a machine learning framework based on the swan model to predict the wave height and period in monterey bay california this framework improved the accuracy of the swan model one of the time recurrent neural networks proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is the long short term memory lstm network lstm does not require special complexity to debug hyperparameters and it can choose to remember or forget long term information through a forget gate graves et al 2009 used lstm to improve handwriting recognition ability which outperformed the hidden markov model sundermeyer et al 2012 improved the modeling and recognition of different language analyses by lstm in addition lstm is widely used in controlling robots predicting diseases analysing stocks and synthesizing music pirhooshyaran and snyder 2019 applied the lstm neural network frameworks for ocean wave data reconstruction when the number of target features is large a deeper structure can improve performance previous studies were dedicated to using different classification algorithms and feedforward neural networks hybrid models and feature selection schemes to improve prediction results but most of the proposed models were only tested in a small range and short prediction time classification algorithm and feedforward neural network are not the best choice for time series analysis hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 but no scholar has used the lstm that a tool suitable for time series analysis to do this work the wave sequence that an important time series is consistent with the characteristics of lstm as it constantly remembers new information and considers the impact of old information therefore this paper presents the use of lstm to predict the wave height at different stations and a comparison of the results with those from back propagation neural network bpnn extreme learning machine elm svm residual network resnet and random forest rf algorithm section 2 introduces measured data and details of ten stations with different metocean conditions in sec 3 the novel long short term memory prediction model is constructed and described in sec 4 numerical

prediction tables 3 and 4 list the test results of the six algorithms at different stations after training verification and testing and the optimal results are shown in bold in these tables it can be

than those of the other algorithms overall which shows lstm was the most stable algorithm most 1 h prediction indicators of station 44007 and 51000 are not the optimal value in tables 3 and 4 but most indicators of ten stations are the best in 6 h prediction as shown in tables 5 and 6 compared with the 1 h prediction effect the number of optimal values of mae rmse and nse increases which shows the ability of lstm in 6 h prediction fig 8 shows a comparison between the observed and predicted values by lstm at every 6 h as the forecast period grows the correlation between the data decreases but lstm can remember much longer period information through its recurrent structure and gating mechanisms xiao et al 2019 the degree of data dispersion is slightly higher than that of 1 h the number of data points with large deviations is lower which shows the results of the lstm algorithm are meaningful fig 9 demonstrates that the lstm algorithm can achieve better prediction results when the wave height is increased reduced and smooth although the location of the stations is widely distributed and the prediction period increases the results of lstm and the observation data fit well the 6 h prediction nse of lstm are all optimal value at ten stations and its performance is better than that of 1 h prediction which shows the powerful generalization capabilities of lstm the effects of lstm on the 6 h wave height prediction at station 41010 and station 51000 are presented in fig 10 for comparison the forecast results of lstm on the 1 h prediction are also illustrated in fig 10 the 1 h prediction results are more consistent with real data than the 6 h results the variation range of 1 h prediction results is much acceptable than those of the 6 h results although the 6 h prediction results are slightly larger at some data points the overall prediction is basically consistent with the measured data which demonstrates the feasibility of lstm in long term swh prediction even for the prediction of 6 h time span 4 3 long term span swh prediction as the scope and complexity of the field of ocean engineering increases the need for longer term swh prediction also increases this paper randomly selects a station with a large amount of data to analyse the prediction ability of lstm station 41008 was used for 12 h 1 day 2 day and 3 day swh prediction table 7 lists the test results for different time spans it can be seen that mae mape and rmse increase continuously while r 2 and nse decrease gradually with an increase in the time span the higher mae is mainly owing to the larger average swh of this station mape is an important indicator that reflects the prediction effect mape of lstm is better than that of sos which was used by akbarifard and radmanesh 2018 an increase in the time interval reduces the correlation coefficient and the accuracy of prediction fig 11 shows the continuous prediction results for four time spans the maximum error of the 12 h prediction result is 0 31 m which is acceptable in 12 h prediction the approximate effect of the 1 day prediction result and the measured data is sufficient only a few points have large errors and the overall prediction effect is satisfactory there is an obvious lag in the 2 day prediction results which have an overestimation effect on the smaller swh however the overall trend is similar to that of the real data the prediction hysteresis is serious and the data fitting effect is poor in the 3 day prediction results the accuracy of prediction should be improved by selecting the appropriate input items 4 4 swan lstm swh prediction method swan is the most commonly used numerical model for simulating ocean wave height and wind speed however when the wind speed and the wave height are high the simulation results are conservative and the error is large montoya et al 2013 therefore we propose a swan lstm method in which the wind direction and wind speed in the last 4 h and the swan simulated wave height are selected as swan lstm input conditions and the lstm method was adopted to revise the data calculated by swan fig 12 shows a comparison between swan swan lstm and the observed data we can clearly see that the trend of swan prediction data is the same as that of the observation data but with a large overall error the same trend can be achieved with swan lstm and the fitting effect is good mae of swan is 1 0969 while that of swan lstm is only 0 3564 the accuracy increased by 67 5 mape of swan is 0 4126 and that of swan lstm is only 0 1395 this accuracy increased by 66 2 therefore the swan lstm model shows higher accuracy and strong applicability in single point prediction 5 conclusions lstm uses historical information to assist with current decisions through the mechanism of a forget gate it can choose to remember or forget long term information even if the information is complex there will be no long term dependence xiao et al 2019 applied an lstm adaboost combination approach for short and midterm surface temperature prediction this solved the overfitting problem and the results improved because lstm has a strong advantage in time series data prediction we chose it to predict swh in this paper we used 6 algorithms to predict the swh at ten different stations with different ocean environmental conditions five indicators were utilized to evaluate the accuracy and stability of the prediction results the results showed that the lstm algorithm can achieve more accurate results in 1 h and 6 h prediction by multiple criteria all of the prediction results demonstrated that lstm outperforms five other algorithms lstm also showed good stability for prediction effects in the two time ranges we can use lstm to supplement missing buoy data which can aid wave sequence continuity analysis the 6 h wave height predictions are acceptable and can be of help to fisheries and offshore engineering projects since the amount of data has a large impact on the forecasting results we recommend using at least 1 year of data for 1 h predictions and 2 years of data for 6 h predictions when analysing stations with different data volumes moreover predictions for four time spans 12 h 1 day 2 days and 3 days were accomplished for station 41008 the results showed the powerful ability of lstm to perform long term prediction a swan lstm model was applied to make a single point prediction and was found to be 65 more accurate than the standard swan model now that the prediction of short term swh can be achieved accurately future work will combine wind speed forecasting models with lstm models to improve the accuracy of long term swh prediction in addition a swan lstm model for a large scale significant wave height simulation will

21889,the hydrodynamic problem of bow flare section entering into water was studied through the cfd computational fluid dynamics method a two phase compressible flow model was established based on n s equations and modeled by vof volume of fluid algorithm the geometric reconstruction approach was adopted to track the free surface and a dynamic mesh approach is used to treat the body motion the bulbous bow is included to clarify its effect on the impact hydrodynamics where two kinds of ship like sections were chosen one with a bulb at the bottom and the other without impact hydrodynamic characteristics including falling kinematics free surface and slamming loads are discussed showing that the pressure nearby the bulbous bow is getting higher than the case without bulb which should be paid attention in the ship structure design special attention is paid to the influence of water entry velocity on secondary impact and results show that water entry velocity has a significant effect on the first pressure peak keywords cfd method bow flare section water entry non viscous flow separation 1 introduction the drastic slamming phenomenon between ship and wave is quite common especially in rough sea the huge force always appears at the bow flare area due to smaller deadrise angle and larger impact velocity in less severe cases it can cause structural fatigue damage due to the frequent slamming in more severe cases it can directly lead to the structural failure research of daidola and mishkevich 1995 shows that the structural damage caused by the slamming loads can reach up to 15 therefore the ship slamming problem has attracted immense attention due to its practical importance in ship structure design the water entry impact is a strong nonlinear problem which may involve various factors such as large deformation of free surface air effect and structural elasticity the analytic formula for a general ship like section entering into water is hardly available due to complicated fluid forms caused by various section shapes so most researchers concentrate on the semi analytic method or numerical simulation since von karman 1929 and wagner 1932 developed the impact theory plenty of numerical methods based on the potential flow theory have been put forward including modified logvinovich model korobkin 2004 qin et al 2011 self similarity solution dobrovol skaya 1969 wu and sun 2014 boundary element method zhao and faltinsen 1993 sun 2007 sun and wu 2013 particle image velocimetry piv reconstitution facci et al 2015 russo et al 2018a lattice boltzmann modeling zarghami et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 and so on most literature mentioned above focus on the simple wedge cases for example zhao and faltinsen 1993 numerically solved the water entry problem of wedge section through using the boundary element method some scholars have tried to discuss the cases of ship like section mei et al 1999 developed a general scheme based on lewis form representations an analytic solution for a bow flare section is obtained which compares favorably with experiments sun 2007 studied the water entry of ship like section based on the boundary element method some other literatures has also presented the research for the ship like section cases such as greenhow and moyo 1997 sun and faltinsen 2009 and ghadimi et al 2014 for some complex geometric shapes like bow flare section with a bulb bow at the bottom or stern section with a screw shaft the non viscous flow separation and air cavity phenomena can easily occur which are difficult to be modeled for example zhao et al 1996 established a local analytical solution at the location of non viscous flow separation in his study non viscous flow separation from a fixed position e g at the knuckle is studied a more common case is that the fluid is separated from an uncertain point such as the water entry of cylinder showed in panciroli et al 2015 and russo et al 2017 sun and faltinsen 2006 studied this non viscous flow separation scheme through simulating the water entry of a cylinder where the separated point should be determined in the numerical procedure although the non viscous flow separation can be modeled it is quite difficult to model the air cavity based on the single flow model due to the numerical difficulty in the various free surface in recent years more complicated fluid forms i e non viscous flow separation and air cavity are included in the water entry problem to further satisfy the practical engineering requirements especially for big bow flare ship i e container ship in order to simulate these phenomena cfd computational fluid dynamics methods are often used reddy et al 2002 used the phoenics software to simulate the water entry problem of wedge control equations were discretized through the finite volume method fvm and free surface was captured by vof method kai et al 2009 simulated this problem through using sph method good agreements are achieved between numerical and experimental results some other similar researches can be found in guo et al 2012 swidan et al 2013 tassin et al 2012 sun et al 2018 and hu et al 2018 when the body shape becomes more complex or the water entry is asymmetrical sun and wu 2013 gu et al 2014 russo et al 2018b krastev et al 2018b there always accompanies the non viscous flow separation and air cavity phenomena for example wang and guedes soares 2013 numerically investigated the water entry of a bow flare section with heel angle by an explicit finite element method the results show the secondary impact happens at the leeward side in all simulated cases and it becomes more apparent for a higher velocity krastev et al 2018a simulated the asymmetrical water entry problems of the wedge by coupling a vof algorithm and laplacian mesh motion solver obvious non viscous flow separation and air cavity can be observed from the free surface evolution many researches carried out by cfd method focused on the simplified shapes such as wedges or bow flare sections without bulbous bow actually impact hydrodynamic characteristics of actual bow flare sections are different to the appearance of these simplified shapes as an example for the drop test of bow flare section with a bulbous bow descripted in xie et al 2020 the bulbous bow can result in the non viscous flow separation when it first enters into water then the separated fluid will hit the flare area and thus cause the secondary impact in this process ventilation and air pocket phenomena maybe occur which of them is similar to the description in wang and guedes soares 2013 non viscous flow separation and air cavity are quite prominent for this case and how to simulate these phenomena reasonably will directly influence the predicting accuracy of slamming loads as for the air cavity some experiments have observed it for example the experimental investigation of wedges in chuang 1966 shows the air will be captured with the deadrise angle is smaller than 3 lin and shieh 1997 measured the pressure and flow field through a high speed charge coupled device ccd camera the air cushion was observed during the water entry of flat panel oh et al 2009 recorded the complex physics phenomenon how the air pocket is formed and disappeared it shows that the pressure time history of flat impact has quite different characteristic than the case of wedges these studies indicate the importance of air in the water entry problem even so only a few researchers focus on the air effect lind et al 2015 numerically investigated the impact of a rigid horizontal plate onto a wave crest and a flat water surface through the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method in this study a two phase model is adopted where the water is incompressible as the air is compressible results show that air cushion significantly affects the impact on to flat water and this effect reduces for waves as the ratio of wave height to wavelength increases xie et al 2018c studied a flat ship hull structure impacting water through the cfd method and carried out corresponding experiments the variation of fluid density is achieved through the gas state equation and good agreements between numerical and experimental results are achieved sun and wang 2018 studied the hydrodynamic impact problem of a stiffened plate through explicit finite element method the effect of air cushion on pressure is discussed reflecting that it primarily increases the pressure duration and reduces its maximum value the main purpose of this paper is to clarify the effect of the bulbous bow on hydrodynamics of bow flare section during water impacts such as fluid dynamic behavior and slamming pressure which are much concerned in ship structure design in order to achieve this purpose the non viscous flow separation and air effect above mentioned should be treated carefully a cfd method based on the commercial code fluent is adopted to study this problem which has been successfully applied in previous literatures yang et al 2007 and xie et al 2018b in there a two phase compressible flow model is established to include the effect of air and it is modeled by the vof algorithm where the free surface is tracked through the geometric reconstruction scheme the dynamic mesh model is used to treat the body motion an important feature in this paper is that the fluid compressibility is taken into account to simulate the air cavity where the ideal gas law is used to update the fluid density the rest of paper is organized as follows in section 2 the mathematical model and numerical procedure were presented in section 3 the mesh convergence study and numerical verification were carried out in section 4 some hydrodynamic characteristics related to water impact including falling kinemics and slamming loads were discussed in addition the secondary impact phenomenon is discussed in detail section 5 draws some important conclusions and outlines the future work 2 numerical methods a cfd method is applied to simulate the water entry of ship sections in the present work which is available in the commercial code fluent this simulation is based on a gas liquid two phase flow model to describe the flow and a vof method to track the free surface 2 1 mathematic model the two fluids air and water are assumed to be immiscible and the dynamic viscosity of fluid is ignored the continuity and momentum equations can be written as 1 ρ t ρ u 0 2 t ρ u ρ u u p ρ g where u is the velocity vector ρ is the fluid density g is the gravity acceleration the cross operation u u is equivalent to u u t we adopt the ideal gas law to include the fluid compressibility which is written as 3 ρ p 0 p m w r t where p 0 is the operating pressure atmospheric pressure p is the local static pressure relative to the operating pressure r is the universal gas constant and m w is the molecular weight the temperature t will be computed from the energy equation written as 4 t ρ e u ρ e p 0 where e is the energy this method can model air effect reasonably on the water entry problem which has been verified by experimental results in our previous study of xie et al 2019 where the bottom slamming with obvious air cushion is simulated the finite volume method is used to solve the continuity and momentum equations in fluent the length in the neglectful dimensional direction is assumed as 1m for a two dimensional flow problem ignoring the pressure gradient and the source terms which correspond to the step of momentum prediction the other terms are discretized as 5 ρ u t d v d t ρ u p r u p n v p 6 ρ u u d v d t ρ u n u r f s f δ t ρ f f n u f r δ t where the superscripts n and r represent the current time step the value is known and the predicted time step the value is unknown respectively the subscript f denotes the value on the grid surface vp is the grid volume δt is the time step f f is the flux for the convective term see eq 6 the flux is calculated through adopting the known velocity at the current time step u n and the other unknown velocity u r which means the convective term is linearized in the numerical procedure the vof method which treats a two phase flow as a single phase flow is adopted to avoid the difficulty of directly solving the momentum equation in this study the air is regarded as the basic phase and the volume fraction satisfies 7 ρ α t ρ α u 0 where α is the volume fraction of air α 0 means the cell is filled with water whereas air 0 α 1 means the cell contains the interface of water and air eq 7 is solved explicitly and the standard finite difference interpolation scheme is applied to calculate the volume fraction the discretization scheme is written as 8 α r ρ a r α n ρ a n δ t u f ρ a u f n α f n 0 where α f is the face value of air volume fraction once the volume fraction is obtained in each time step the scalars ρ and e should be updated because the fluid is treated as a variable density single flow in vof method and they are treated as mass averaged variables 9 ρ α ρ a 1 α ρ w 10 e α ρ a e a 1 α ρ w e w ρ where the ρ a and ρ w are the density of air and water e a and e w are the energy of air and water respectively in the numerical simulation the presto pressure staggering option is adopted using for the pressure interpolation on the interface of air and water bender 1980 which is more effective than the standard linear scheme in complex cavity flows the gradient terms in the flow conservation equations use a green gauss node based method rausch et al 1991 this scheme reconstructs exact values of a linear function at a node from surrounding cell centered values on arbitrary unstructured meshes by solving a constrained minimization problem preserving a second order spatial accuracy for the couple of velocity and pressure solutions the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm is used to establish an iterative relationship between velocity and pressure and find a stable solution in iteration which is introduced by issa 1986 2 2 geometric reconstruction approach the simulation of the free surface is performed by tracking the evolution of the interface between the fluid and the gas air which is an effective free surface the geometric reconstruction approach which is a kind of vof type method is applied to capture the free surface in this approach the standard interpolation scheme is used to obtain the face flux whenever a grid is completely filled with water or air when the grid is near the interface between two phases the geometric reconstruction scheme is adopted which represents the interface through a piecewise linear approach the geometric reconstruction scheme is generalized for unstructured meshes in the work of youngs 1982 it assumes that the interface has a linear slope within each grid and uses this linear shape for a calculation of the advection of fluid through the cell faces this technique has been successfully applied to many complex multi phase problems in which several interfaces were present such as yang et al 2007 facci et al 2016 and iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 however in the geometric reconstruction scheme it is difficult to calculate the normal and curvature in the air water interface due to the unsmooth curve of air water interface such a case can reduce the numerical accuracy at the interface especially for the flow with obvious air cavity in order to solve this dilemma a level set function can be applied to keep the smoothness of interface we redefine the volume fraction in vof method through introducing the level set function φ x y t which is the coupled level set and vof clsvof method the volume fraction f α t can be written as 11 f α t 1 α 1 ω h φ x y t d x d y where ω is the grid domain h is the heaviside function written as 12 h φ 1 if φ 0 0 otherwise this coupled method can be easily achieved in feluent through coupling corresponding solver in the following analysis we define this treatment as the corrected vof method 2 3 treatment of body motion in each time step the force generated by the encompassing fluid reacting to the bow flare section can be expressed as 13 f l w p n d l where l w is the body boundary and n is the unit normal to the body the vertical acceleration can be calculated according to newton s second law as 14 a f z m g where m is the body mass g is the gravity acceleration f z is the vertical force obtained in eq 13 dynamic mesh model is used to treat the body motion and the auto re meshing technology is adopted to improve the mesh deformation which of them can be obtained in fluent 2 4 models and boundary conditions the typical bow flare section was chosen where two kinds of models were made one with a bulbous bow shape model 1 and the other without it model 2 fig 1 a illustrates the sketch of these two models it can be seen that they have the same flared area in fact the parameters of these two kinds of models are completely identical including the dimension and mass except the bottom shape the mass of both ship sections is set as 400 kg fig 1 b shows the information of measured pressure locations the influence of bulbous bow on the slamming pressure can be discussed through comparing the numerical results of these two models the free fall of bow flare section with initial vertical velocity v impacting the clam water is shown in fig 2 the size of fluid domain is 5 m 4 m with the initial water depth 3m a cartesian coordinate system o y z is used where y axis locates at the undisturbed free surface and z axis points upwards the time instant t 0s represents the model just touches water boundary conditions are set following the conclusions of previous computational studies using the cfd method facci and ubertini 2015 and facci et al 2015 the boundary conditions applied in the present study are as follows i no slip and n p 0 on the hull surface sr ii p 0 and n u 0 on the top boundary st and iii free slip and n p 0 on the bottom sb and truncated boundary sc it is noted that no slip condition means that there is no relative motion between the fluid and the solid wall defined as u v v is the body motion the alternative one is the free slip boundary condition which is the velocity of the fluid at the wall surface is not zero but related to the shear stress according to the guide of ansys 2009 in general for the analysis of large scale flow field the body wall belongs to the non slip boundary for micro dimensional flow i e 10 6 m it has been proved that the free slip boundary conditions can be considered to make the numerical results consistent with the actual situation for the present research object the fluid domain is not a micro dimension so the no slip boundary on the hull body is chosen the accuracy of these boundary conditions for water entry problem has been verified in facci et al 2015 3 convergence study and numerical verification 3 1 convergence study different mesh sizes used in the fluid domain and time steps should be firstly discussed to verify the convergence in order to apply the conclusion of convergence study to decide the mesh size and time step for the simulations of different models whose shape dimension and velocities are different some reference parameters are used here for the mesh size the ratio of minimum mesh to body dimension is most important which can be applied to different dimensional models three different mesh sizes listed in table 1 were used the unstructured mesh was obtained through a mesh pre processor icem cfd the sketch of mesh is shown in fig 3 fig 3 a shows the mesh in whole fluid domain used in mesh 2 and fig 3 b c show the mesh nearby the body obtained by three different mesh sizes respectively in the mesh convergence the initial velocity is 4 m s and then the body drops freely the mass for the section is 400 kg the time step should be small as possible to avoid its effect on the predicted results which is unified as 1e 4s the predicted local pressure at p1 and vertical force are compared see fig 4 for the local pressure p1 position see fig 1 results of mesh2 and mesh3 are almost identical with a relative error 2 however the results of mesh1 cannot capture the pressure peak well because larger error appears between mesh1 and the other two mesh sizes mesh2 and mesh3 for the total impact force results of mesh2 and mesh3 are also close with an average error 3 it means that the mesh2 is enough to guarantee the numerical accuracy in addition the cpu time of mesh3 is two times more than the mesh2 see table 1 therefore in the present study mesh2 is adopted in the following simulation to save the cpu time which is no longer explained in the following unless otherwise specified as for the determination of time step dt it is greatly related to the falling velocity we define a reference time to solve this dilemma written as 15 t 0 h v 0 where h is the vertical height of hull surface from keel to top v 0 is the initial impact velocity the water will just submerge the top surface of body at t t 0 if the water pile up and variation of velocity during impact are ignored according to the results of sun 2007 the maximum impact force appears around such time instants for the actual impact case the body has been completely submerged at t 0 therefore the time t 0 can be regarded as the total time of calculation because the maximum impact force has been obtained before it for different impact case different velocity and body dimension we can use the total step number ns to replace the actual time step dt where the time step dt can be calculated by the following formula 16 d t t 0 n s three different step numbers are used to study the convergence of time step defined as ns 600 1000 and 1400 in addition mesh3 is used to obtain the fluid grid which can avoid the influence of mesh size fig 5 shows the comparison results the influence of time step on the force peak is smaller than the mesh size where the relative error between ns 600 and ns 1400 is about 3 6 while it is about 9 2 for the case of mesh1 and mesh3 however instantaneous impact forces at t 0 12s show obvious difference the impact force at this time instant is caused by jet flow impact which is sensitive to the time step in order to capture the peak of jet flow impact which is important in this paper the total step number ns should be chosen as 1400 3 2 numerical verification in this paper two factors non viscous flow separation and air cavity are our main concerns which should be precisely modeled numerical verifications of them carry out in this part 3 2 1 secondary impact verification the secondary impact caused by separated flow is firstly verified a truncated 3d bow flared model with the size of 1042 mm 667 mm 552 mm from the experiment of xie et al 2018a was utilized to verify the numerical results the water entry of a typical bow flare section in the experiment was simulated four pressure monitoring points p1 p4 were chosen which accords to the positions of p6 p9 in the drop experiment the details of bow flare section and the measuring pressure position are shown in fig 6 a in the experiment the vibrations of falling rig cause oscillations in the forces in addition the difference of 3d model experiment and 2d numerical model may also cause a difference of water entry velocity if free falling motion is adopted in order to avoid these effects we can input the corresponding velocity from the experimental data see fig 6 b into the numerical calculations instead of solving the equation of motion it is noted that three dimensionality of the ship hull is neglected in the 2d simulations which may cause the difference between the model tests and the calculations in fact this part mainly concentrates on whether the present cfd method can model the second impact and whether the pressure peak is similar the discussion of numerical accuracy will be further discussed in section 3 2 2 the comparison result of pressure time history is shown in fig 7 the diameter of pressure sensor in the experiment is 8 mm so the calculated pressure on the same sensor area is averaged to compare the experimental ones two obvious pressure peaks of p1 and p2 are observed where the first impact has less time duration than the second one the first pressure peak is caused by jet flow which is separated from the bulbous bow while the second peak is caused by body extruding water during water entry the first pressure peak p1 and p2 is similar in the magnitude and time of occurrence between numerical and experimental results showing that the predicted pressure caused by jet flow basically agrees with the experimental data such a result reflects that the jet flow impact can be modeled reasonably through present cfd method some differences between the numerical and experimental results can be observed for the pressure at p3 and p4 the secondary impact is not obvious because the first pressure peak is small some differences of pressure amplitude between numerical and experimental results can be observed with about 15 error which mainly comes from the three dimensional effects of truncated 3d bow flared model even so the time of occurrence of impact and the pressure peak is similar reflecting that the presented method can give a reasonable result when predicting this secondary impact phenomenon 3 2 2 air cavity verification in order to verify the capability of modeling air cavity we chose the free surface recorded in the experiment of judge et al 2004 as a reference in the experiment a wedge with deadrise angle 37 is used in the simulation the heel angle of wedge is 5 and the vertical velocity is 3 81 m s as the horizontal velocity 7 62 m s for the asymmetrical water entry case the boundary and fluid domain can refer to the study of xie et al 2018b fig 8 shows the comparison of the free surface for the left side of wedge the cavity can be correctly modeled by our numerical simulation for the right side the water pile up which is the most important fluid characteristic related to the slamming pressure is also accurately modeled we further compare the pressure of wedge entering into water where the experiment of barjasteh et al 2016 is chosen in order to consider the air effect the deadrise angle of wedge is small as possible in there the wedge with deadrise 20 is used and the inclination angle to right side is 5 and 10 respectively in the simulation the length of model is 205 mm with total mass 44 kg the initial vertical velocity is 3 13 m s fig 9 shows the pressure distribution obtained by various methods where the dimensionless quantities showed in the axis are defined as 17 c p 2 p ρ w v 2 18 x 1 x c l where p is the pressure ρ w is the water density v is the water entry velocity x is the horizontal coordinate c l is one half of the wetted length the time corresponds to the instant at which the pressure at p3 comes up to the peak value the length from p3 to keel is 126 mm in the experiment of barjasteh et al 2016 it can be seen that pressure peaks obtained by ocfd and ccfd are close however the pressure distributed at the middle part is a little bigger which will cause more obvious asymmetry in ocfd method the diameter of pressure sensor in the experiments is 6 4 mm therefore the average value of the calculated pressure by numerical method on the same sensor area is used to compare the pressure peak with experiments the comparison between the present method ccfd and experiments has been listed in table 2 the relative error between present method and experimental data on the right side is larger than that on the left side and the maximum error is 15 in addition the pressure peak from sam is 18 larger than the experimental data in fig 9 a and it increases to 40 in fig 9 b in contrast the error of cip method and experimental value is less than 10 in fact the angle between the right side and the calm water level becomes very small due to the inclination angle 15 in figs 9 a and 10 o in fig 9 b the air is easily captured when the wedge impacting water which acts as an air cushion to reduce the impact velocity and thus reduce the pressure on the body for the results of sam it is based on the single flow model so the effect of air cushion is ignored however cip and cfd methods are based on the air water two phase model which can give more reasonable results when the air effect is important 4 results and discussion two impact cases with initial water entry velocities 2 m s and 4 m s are simulated to analyze the falling kinematics where the body drops freely with total mass 400 kg to improve the understanding of obtained results the non dimensional coefficients including velocity acceleration pressure and vertical force are defined as 19 v v t v 0 20 a a t g 21 c p 2 p t ρ w v t 2 22 c f 2 f z t ρ w v t 2 l where ρ w is the density of water l is breadth of bow flared section v 0 is the initial impact velocity and g is the acceleration of gravity as 9 8 m s2 the v a p and f z are the velocity acceleration pressure and vertical force respectively and the v a cp and cf are the corresponding non dimensional coefficients 4 1 velocity and acceleration analysis the comparisons of velocity and acceleration between two models are firstly carried out to clarify the influence of bulbous bow on the falling kinematics fig 10 shows the comparative results in terms of non dimensional velocity in fig 10 a their results are almost same at the early stage t 0 034s however the difference enlarges at the later stage t 0 034s and reaches a maximum at 0 19s the velocity peak in model 1 is 6 2 larger than model 2 in addition the time instant of arriving maximum velocity in model 1 delays about 0 03s than model 2 but they are almost same at t 0 44s which suggests that the velocity of model 1 decreases more quickly in the decline stage in fig 10 b the difference between the two velocities seems to the largest at around 0 16s and the velocity peak in model 1 is 4 1 larger than that in model 2 the acceleration is also compared to further discuss the falling kinematics see fig 11 the maximum acceleration in model 2 is about 16 5 larger than model 1 in the case of initial water entry velocity 2 m s and 19 1 for the case of initial water entry velocity 4 m s for model 1 there are two obvious fluctuations in the increment stage about t 0 034s and t 0 147s see fig 11 a while there are no such fluctuations for model 2 such a consequence can be explained through focusing on the bulbous bow when the bulbous bow firstly touches the water the bottom impact happens which causes the first fluctuation t 0 034s then the fluid is separated from the bulbous bow and hits the body generating a transient impact force which causes the second fluctuation t 0 147s this phenomenon is the so called secondary impact which has been verified by the experimental result of xie et al 2020 another obvious characteristic is that the time instant of acceleration reaching to maximum in model 2 is earlier than the model 1 which means the fluid in model 2 climbs more quickly than model 1 4 2 free surface characteristics the water pile up is an important feature in the water impact problems which is closely related to the slamming loads the evolution of the free surface is discussed in this part fig 12 shows the free surface evolution of model 1 for free falling case with initial water entry velocity 4 m s in fig 12 a the non viscous flow separation occurs nearby the bulbous bow then the separated fluid goes up see fig 12 b until it hits the body surface again fig 12 c after that an air cavity is formed see fig 12 d this air cavity is changing its geometrical shape and moves along the body surface see fig 12 e finally the water submerges the body and separates from the edge of body see fig 12 f fig 13 illustrates the evolution of air water interface for model 2 the water continuously climbs along the body and the jet flow can be clearly observed at the time instants 0 09s and 0 12s quite obvious difference of water pile up caused by bulbous bow can be seen in figs 12 and 13 for example complicated fluid forms including non viscous flow separation and air pocket appear in fig 12 while these phenomena do not occur in fig 13 fig 14 shows the pressure distribution to check the correspondence between the free surface evolution and slamming pressure the time instants accord to those showed in figs 12 and 13 so as to explain the relationship between free surface and slamming pressure the horizontal axis represents the value of z direction see fig 1 b the reason why we do not adopt the y direction as the horizontal axis is that there have multiple same y values at different position in model 1 which cannot guarantee the one to one correspondence of y value and slamming pressure in fig 14 a we can see that the pressure nearby the bulbous bow 0 01m z 0 24m reduces and it even become negative value less than atmospheric pressure at the initial impacting stage t 0 09s the negative pressure area lies nearby the free surface and the pressure becomes positive value with time increasing t 0 12s from the plots in fig 12 a and 12 b air is not attached to the bulb which means pressure increase on the bulb is not due to ventilation but due to the change of the water flow around it after that the high pressure area 0 3m z 0 5m appears when the air cavity is just enclosed t 0 12s the pressure at air cavity area is not zero which can be explained by considering the water pressing the air due to the limitation of 2d model the air cannot escape the body surface is a support boundary of the air pocket and thus bears larger pressure however the pressure on the air pocket 0 3m z 0 4m is smaller than that in the area of water hitting the body 0 4m z 0 5m pressure distribution characteristics of model 2 see fig 14 b are quite different from model 1 for example the pressure increases gradually before the non viscous flow separation t 0 15s and the pressure surrounded by water wetted surface is almost constant when the water just submerges the body t 0 15s the pressure distribution arrives maximum after that t 0 15s the pressure drops quickly 4 3 characteristics of slamming loads slamming loads are often concerned in the ship structure design to discuss the influence of the bulbous bow on the slamming loads comparison analysis of pressure at different positions is carried out the individual pressure comparison is shown in fig 15 the influence of bulbous bow is discussed in the following two parts pressure time history and pressure peak firstly we focus on the characteristic of pressure time history for model 1 pressure at p1 and p2 positions appears two peaks the first 1 at t 0 12s and the other at t 0 16s according to the free surface showed in fig 12 d the first peak is caused by the separated fluid hitting the body jet flow impact the second peak is caused by the body extruding water for model 2 the appearance of pressure is similar to that in the wedge impact where there is only one peak in the time history of pressure in addition the oscillation in model 1 is more obvious than the model 2 the high frequency components in the pressure might be caused by the captured air cavity and this needs to be further proved by more sophisticated analysis then we concentrate on the pressure peak on the one hand the time instant of arriving peak second peak for p1 and p2 in model 1 is delayed about 0 035s than model 2 it indicates that the water in model 1 climbs more slowly which can be seen from the evolution of free surface shown in figs 12 and 13 on the other hand the pressure peaks nearby the bulbous bow model 1 are larger than the case of model 2 with the relative increments of 23 p1 and 34 p2 however the differences of pressure peaks away from bulbous bow reduce to 1 9 p3 2 3 p4 and 0 7 p5 it implies that the bulbous bow increases the local pressure peak nearby it and does not influence the pressure away from it 4 4 discussion of secondary impact phenomenon the main purpose of this part is to improve the ship structure design through discussing the influence of secondary impact phenomenon on the slamming pressure it should be noted that the actual ship slamming is different from the free water entry due to locality of ship slamming for example the velocity peak is 45 larger than the initial impact velocity showed in fig 10 a which does not accord with the fact of actual ship impact because ship motion is hard to be changed by the local impact force that means the variation of velocity between free drop test and actual ship slamming is different for this dilemma non dimensional pressure coefficients are usually used to improve better implications of the obtained results according to the discussion of free surface in section 4 2 and the pressure time history in section 4 3 the water entry velocity is a key factor for the secondary impact it is necessary to discuss its influence on the non dimensional pressure coefficient in order to avoid the influence of acceleration the forced motion of model 1 with constant velocity 4 m s was simulated using the present cfd method the constant water entry problem can be achieved through defining an enormous model mass where the model mass is defined as 5e10kg fig 16 shows the time history of non dimensional pressure coefficient at four positions p1 p4 for model 1 with the constant water entry velocities of 3 m s 6 m s 9 m s and 12 m s the locations of these four monitor points have been shown in fig 1 b the t 0s was unified as the time instant of body just touching the clam water it can be clearly seen that the first pressure peaks at p1 and p2 increase along the velocity rising while the second pressure peak changes a little for p3 and p4 there is only one pressure peak and it has no significant change with velocity it indicates that the influence of water entry velocity on the non dimensional pressure coefficient is significant nearby the junction of bulbous bow and flare section i e p1 and p2 where secondary impact occurs however it becomes inessential when the location is far from the bulbous bow i e p3 and p4 such a result suggests that one should be careful when predicting the impact pressure caused by jet flow first peak through applying a non dimensional pressure coefficient cp in such a case we can still use the non dimensional cp but the cp is not independent of the water entry velocity 5 conclusions the water entry problem of bow flare section considering bulbous bow had been studied numerically the influence of bulbous bow on the slamming loads is investigated through using cfd method which couples a fluid solver and a motion solver the convergence study is firstly carried out through comparing the results obtained by different mesh sizes and time steps for the mesh size calculated result is converged to a constant value when the size ratio of minimum cell and body is less than 0 004 for the time step the result is convergence when the total time steps ns is larger than 1400 then the numerical verifications are carried out through comparing numerical and experimental results the present numerical method correctly modeled the secondary impact and air effect showing good capacity on the prediction of slamming pressure with complicated fluid forms i e non viscous flow separation and air cavity the influence of bulbous bow on some important impact hydrodynamics including water pile up and pressure had been discussed complicated fluid forms including non viscous flow separation and air pocket occur due to the influence of the bulbous bow while these phenomena do not occur when the bulbous bow is cut off these fluid forms further result in the differences of slamming loads the impact in model 1 occurs later about 0 035s than model 2 at the same position and its oscillation of pressure is more obvious in addition pressure peaks of p1 and p2 model 1 are about 30 larger than model 2 while there are no obvious differences at p3 p4 and p5 less than 10 these differences suggest that the bulbous bow can increase the local slamming pressure nearby the junction of bulbous bow and flare section which should be paid more attention in the ship structure design the influence of impact velocity on slamming pressure is further discussed through comparing the non dimensional pressure coefficient in different water entry cases with various impact velocities the results show that the secondary impact is more obvious when the velocity increases in addition the influence of impact velocity is limited to the area nearby the bulbous bow where it is close to the secondary impact area and has less effect on the region away from it results of this study are expected to improve our understanding of the influence of the bulbous bow on slamming loads through systematically comparing the impact hydrodynamic characteristics of these two models the numerical method aims at improving the ship structure design which includes the air effect and non viscous flow separation however 3d effects are important for the secondary impact and air cavity evolution so the study should be generalized to 3d models to improve the application in predicting the slamming loads of 3d ship hull in addition elastic effect is also important for thin wall steel ships and further study can be focused on the coupled effects of the fluid structure responses credit authorship contribution statement hang xie writing original draft fang liu

21889,the hydrodynamic problem of bow flare section entering into water was studied through the cfd computational fluid dynamics method a two phase compressible flow model was established based on n s equations and modeled by vof volume of fluid algorithm the geometric reconstruction approach was adopted to track the free surface and a dynamic mesh approach is used to treat the body motion the bulbous bow is included to clarify its effect on the impact hydrodynamics where two kinds of ship like sections were chosen one with a bulb at the bottom and the other without impact hydrodynamic characteristics including falling kinematics free surface and slamming loads are discussed showing that the pressure nearby the bulbous bow is getting higher than the case without bulb which should be paid attention in the ship structure design special attention is paid to the influence of water entry velocity on secondary impact and results show that water entry velocity has a significant effect on the first pressure peak keywords cfd method bow flare section water entry non viscous flow separation 1 introduction the drastic slamming phenomenon between ship and wave is quite common especially in rough sea the huge force always appears at the bow flare area due to smaller deadrise angle and larger impact velocity in less severe cases it can cause structural fatigue damage due to the frequent slamming in more severe cases it can directly lead to the structural failure research of daidola and mishkevich 1995 shows that the structural damage caused by the slamming loads can reach up to 15 therefore the ship slamming problem has attracted immense attention due to its practical importance in ship structure design the water entry impact is a strong nonlinear problem which may involve various factors such as large deformation of free surface air effect and structural elasticity the analytic formula for a general ship like section entering into water is hardly available due to complicated fluid forms caused by various section shapes so most researchers concentrate on the semi analytic method or numerical simulation since von karman 1929 and wagner 1932 developed the impact theory plenty of numerical methods based on the potential flow theory have been put forward including modified logvinovich model korobkin 2004 qin et al 2011 self similarity solution dobrovol skaya 1969 wu and sun 2014 boundary element method zhao and faltinsen 1993 sun 2007 sun and wu 2013 particle image velocimetry piv reconstitution facci et al 2015 russo et al 2018a lattice boltzmann modeling zarghami et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 and so on most literature mentioned above focus on the simple wedge cases for example zhao and faltinsen 1993 numerically solved the water entry problem of wedge section through using the boundary element method some scholars have tried to discuss the cases of ship like section mei et al 1999 developed a general scheme based on lewis form representations an analytic solution for a bow flare section is obtained which compares favorably with experiments sun 2007 studied the water entry of ship like section based on the boundary element method some other literatures has also presented the research for the ship like section cases such as greenhow and moyo 1997 sun and faltinsen 2009 and ghadimi et al 2014 for some complex geometric shapes like bow flare section with a bulb bow at the bottom or stern section with a screw shaft the non viscous flow separation and air cavity phenomena can easily occur which are difficult to be modeled for example zhao et al 1996 established a local analytical solution at the location of non viscous flow separation in his study non viscous flow separation from a fixed position e g at the knuckle is studied a more common case is that the fluid is separated from an uncertain point such as the water entry of cylinder showed in panciroli et al 2015 and russo et al 2017 sun and faltinsen 2006 studied this non viscous flow separation scheme through simulating the water entry of a cylinder where the separated point should be determined in the numerical procedure although the non viscous flow separation can be modeled it is quite difficult to model the air cavity based on the single flow model due to the numerical difficulty in the various free surface in recent years more complicated fluid forms i e non viscous flow separation and air cavity are included in the water entry problem to further satisfy the practical engineering requirements especially for big bow flare ship i e container ship in order to simulate these phenomena cfd computational fluid dynamics methods are often used reddy et al 2002 used the phoenics software to simulate the water entry problem of wedge control equations were discretized through the finite volume method fvm and free surface was captured by vof method kai et al 2009 simulated this problem through using sph method good agreements are achieved between numerical and experimental results some other similar researches can be found in guo et al 2012 swidan et al 2013 tassin et al 2012 sun et al 2018 and hu et al 2018 when the body shape becomes more complex or the water entry is asymmetrical sun and wu 2013 gu et al 2014 russo et al 2018b krastev et al 2018b there always accompanies the non viscous flow separation and air cavity phenomena for example wang and guedes soares 2013 numerically investigated the water entry of a bow flare section with heel angle by an explicit finite element method the results show the secondary impact happens at the leeward side in all simulated cases and it becomes more apparent for a higher velocity krastev et al 2018a simulated the asymmetrical water entry problems of the wedge by coupling a vof algorithm and laplacian mesh motion solver obvious non viscous flow separation and air cavity can be observed from the free surface evolution many researches carried out by cfd method focused on the simplified shapes such as wedges or bow flare sections without bulbous bow actually impact hydrodynamic characteristics of actual bow flare sections are different to the appearance of these simplified shapes as an example for the drop test of bow flare section with a bulbous bow descripted in xie et al 2020 the bulbous bow can result in the non viscous flow separation when it first enters into water then the separated fluid will hit the flare area and thus cause the secondary impact in this process ventilation and air pocket phenomena maybe occur which of them is similar to the description in wang and guedes soares 2013 non viscous flow separation and air cavity are quite prominent for this case and how to simulate these phenomena reasonably will directly influence the predicting accuracy of slamming loads as for the air cavity some experiments have observed it for example the experimental investigation of wedges in chuang 1966 shows the air will be captured with the deadrise angle is smaller than 3 lin and shieh 1997 measured the pressure and flow field through a high speed charge coupled device ccd camera the air cushion was observed during the water entry of flat panel oh et al 2009 recorded the complex physics phenomenon how the air pocket is formed and disappeared it shows that the pressure time history of flat impact has quite different characteristic than the case of wedges these studies indicate the importance of air in the water entry problem even so only a few researchers focus on the air effect lind et al 2015 numerically investigated the impact of a rigid horizontal plate onto a wave crest and a flat water surface through the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method in this study a two phase model is adopted where the water is incompressible as the air is compressible results show that air cushion significantly affects the impact on to flat water and this effect reduces for waves as the ratio of wave height to wavelength increases xie et al 2018c studied a flat ship hull structure impacting water through the cfd method and carried out corresponding experiments the variation of fluid density is achieved through the gas state equation and good agreements between numerical and experimental results are achieved sun and wang 2018 studied the hydrodynamic impact problem of a stiffened plate through explicit finite element method the effect of air cushion on pressure is discussed reflecting that it primarily increases the pressure duration and reduces its maximum value the main purpose of this paper is to clarify the effect of the bulbous bow on hydrodynamics of bow flare section during water impacts such as fluid dynamic behavior and slamming pressure which are much concerned in ship structure design in order to achieve this purpose the non viscous flow separation and air effect above mentioned should be treated carefully a cfd method based on the commercial code fluent is adopted to study this problem which has been successfully applied in previous literatures yang et al 2007 and xie et al 2018b in there a two phase compressible flow model is established to include the effect of air and it is modeled by the vof algorithm where the free surface is tracked through the geometric reconstruction scheme the dynamic mesh model is used to treat the body motion an important feature in this paper is that the fluid compressibility is taken into account to simulate the air cavity where the ideal gas law is used to update the fluid density the rest of paper is organized as follows in section 2 the mathematical model and numerical procedure were presented in section 3 the mesh convergence study and numerical verification were carried out in section 4 some hydrodynamic characteristics related to water impact including falling kinemics and slamming loads were discussed in addition the secondary impact phenomenon is discussed in detail section 5 draws some important conclusions and outlines the future work 2 numerical methods a cfd method is applied to simulate the water entry of ship sections in the present work which is available in the commercial code fluent this simulation is based on a gas liquid two phase flow model to describe the flow and a vof method to track the free surface 2 1 mathematic model the two fluids air and water are assumed to be immiscible and the dynamic viscosity of fluid is ignored the continuity and momentum equations can be written as 1 ρ t ρ u 0 2 t ρ u ρ u u p ρ g where u is the velocity vector ρ is the fluid density g is the gravity acceleration the cross operation u u is equivalent to u u t we adopt the ideal gas law to include the fluid compressibility which is written as 3 ρ p 0 p m w r t where p 0 is the operating pressure atmospheric pressure p is the local static pressure relative to the operating pressure r is the universal gas constant and m w is the molecular weight the temperature t will be computed from the energy equation written as 4 t ρ e u ρ e p 0 where e is the energy this method can model air effect reasonably on the water entry problem which has been verified by experimental results in our previous study of xie et al 2019 where the bottom slamming with obvious air cushion is simulated the finite volume method is used to solve the continuity and momentum equations in fluent the length in the neglectful dimensional direction is assumed as 1m for a two dimensional flow problem ignoring the pressure gradient and the source terms which correspond to the step of momentum prediction the other terms are discretized as 5 ρ u t d v d t ρ u p r u p n v p 6 ρ u u d v d t ρ u n u r f s f δ t ρ f f n u f r δ t where the superscripts n and r represent the current time step the value is known and the predicted time step the value is unknown respectively the subscript f denotes the value on the grid surface vp is the grid volume δt is the time step f f is the flux for the convective term see eq 6 the flux is calculated through adopting the known velocity at the current time step u n and the other unknown velocity u r which means the convective term is linearized in the numerical procedure the vof method which treats a two phase flow as a single phase flow is adopted to avoid the difficulty of directly solving the momentum equation in this study the air is regarded as the basic phase and the volume fraction satisfies 7 ρ α t ρ α u 0 where α is the volume fraction of air α 0 means the cell is filled with water whereas air 0 α 1 means the cell contains the interface of water and air eq 7 is solved explicitly and the standard finite difference interpolation scheme is applied to calculate the volume fraction the discretization scheme is written as 8 α r ρ a r α n ρ a n δ t u f ρ a u f n α f n 0 where α f is the face value of air volume fraction once the volume fraction is obtained in each time step the scalars ρ and e should be updated because the fluid is treated as a variable density single flow in vof method and they are treated as mass averaged variables 9 ρ α ρ a 1 α ρ w 10 e α ρ a e a 1 α ρ w e w ρ where the ρ a and ρ w are the density of air and water e a and e w are the energy of air and water respectively in the numerical simulation the presto pressure staggering option is adopted using for the pressure interpolation on the interface of air and water bender 1980 which is more effective than the standard linear scheme in complex cavity flows the gradient terms in the flow conservation equations use a green gauss node based method rausch et al 1991 this scheme reconstructs exact values of a linear function at a node from surrounding cell centered values on arbitrary unstructured meshes by solving a constrained minimization problem preserving a second order spatial accuracy for the couple of velocity and pressure solutions the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm is used to establish an iterative relationship between velocity and pressure and find a stable solution in iteration which is introduced by issa 1986 2 2 geometric reconstruction approach the simulation of the free surface is performed by tracking the evolution of the interface between the fluid and the gas air which is an effective free surface the geometric reconstruction approach which is a kind of vof type method is applied to capture the free surface in this approach the standard interpolation scheme is used to obtain the face flux whenever a grid is completely filled with water or air when the grid is near the interface between two phases the geometric reconstruction scheme is adopted which represents the interface through a piecewise linear approach the geometric reconstruction scheme is generalized for unstructured meshes in the work of youngs 1982 it assumes that the interface has a linear slope within each grid and uses this linear shape for a calculation of the advection of fluid through the cell faces this technique has been successfully applied to many complex multi phase problems in which several interfaces were present such as yang et al 2007 facci et al 2016 and iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 however in the geometric reconstruction scheme it is difficult to calculate the normal and curvature in the air water interface due to the unsmooth curve of air water interface such a case can reduce the numerical accuracy at the interface especially for the flow with obvious air cavity in order to solve this dilemma a level set function can be applied to keep the smoothness of interface we redefine the volume fraction in vof method through introducing the level set function φ x y t which is the coupled level set and vof clsvof method the volume fraction f α t can be written as 11 f α t 1 α 1 ω h φ x y t d x d y where ω is the grid domain h is the heaviside function written as 12 h φ 1 if φ 0 0 otherwise this coupled method can be easily achieved in feluent through coupling corresponding solver in the following analysis we define this treatment as the corrected vof method 2 3 treatment of body motion in each time step the force generated by the encompassing fluid reacting to the bow flare section can be expressed as 13 f l w p n d l where l w is the body boundary and n is the unit normal to the body the vertical acceleration can be calculated according to newton s second law as 14 a f z m g where m is the body mass g is the gravity acceleration f z is the vertical force obtained in eq 13 dynamic mesh model is used to treat the body motion and the auto re meshing technology is adopted to improve the mesh deformation which of them can be obtained in fluent 2 4 models and boundary conditions the typical bow flare section was chosen where two kinds of models were made one with a bulbous bow shape model 1 and the other without it model 2 fig 1 a illustrates the sketch of these two models it can be seen that they have the same flared area in fact the parameters of these two kinds of models are completely identical including the dimension and mass except the bottom shape the mass of both ship sections is set as 400 kg fig 1 b shows the information of measured pressure locations the influence of bulbous bow on the slamming pressure can be discussed through comparing the numerical results of these two models the free fall of bow flare section with initial vertical velocity v impacting the clam water is shown in fig 2 the size of fluid domain is 5 m 4 m with the initial water depth 3m a cartesian coordinate system o y z is used where y axis locates at the undisturbed free surface and z axis points upwards the time instant t 0s represents the model just touches water boundary conditions are set following the conclusions of previous computational studies using the cfd method facci and ubertini 2015 and facci et al 2015 the boundary conditions applied in the present study are as follows i no slip and n p 0 on the hull surface sr ii p 0 and n u 0 on the top boundary st and iii free slip and n p 0 on the bottom sb and truncated boundary sc it is noted that no slip condition means that there is no relative motion between the fluid and the solid wall defined as u v v is the body motion the alternative one is the free slip boundary condition which is the velocity of the fluid at the wall surface is not zero but related to the shear stress according to the guide of ansys 2009 in general for the analysis of large scale flow field the body wall belongs to the non slip boundary for micro dimensional flow i e 10 6 m it has been proved that the free slip boundary conditions can be considered to make the numerical results consistent with the actual situation for the present research object the fluid domain is not a micro dimension so the no slip boundary on the hull body is chosen the accuracy of these boundary conditions for water entry problem has been verified in facci et al 2015 3 convergence study and numerical verification 3 1 convergence study different mesh sizes used in the fluid domain and time steps should be firstly discussed to verify the convergence in order to apply the conclusion of convergence study to decide the mesh size and time step for the simulations of different models whose shape dimension and velocities are different some reference parameters are used here for the mesh size the ratio of minimum mesh to body dimension is most important which can be applied to different dimensional models three different mesh sizes listed in table 1 were used the unstructured mesh was obtained through a mesh pre processor icem cfd the sketch of mesh is shown in fig 3 fig 3 a shows the mesh in whole fluid domain used in mesh 2 and fig 3 b c show the mesh nearby the body obtained by three different mesh sizes respectively in the mesh convergence the initial velocity is 4 m s and then the body drops freely the mass for the section is 400 kg the time step should be small as possible to avoid its effect on the predicted results which is unified as 1e 4s the predicted local pressure at p1 and vertical force are compared see fig 4 for the local pressure p1 position see fig 1 results of mesh2 and mesh3 are almost identical with a relative error 2 however the results of mesh1 cannot capture the pressure peak well because larger error appears between mesh1 and the other two mesh sizes mesh2 and mesh3 for the total impact force results of mesh2 and mesh3 are also close with an average error 3 it means that the mesh2 is enough to guarantee the numerical accuracy in addition the cpu time of mesh3 is two times more than the mesh2 see table 1 therefore in the present study mesh2 is adopted in the following simulation to save the cpu time which is no longer explained in the following unless otherwise specified as for the determination of time step dt it is greatly related to the falling velocity we define a reference time to solve this dilemma written as 15 t 0 h v 0 where h is the vertical height of hull surface from keel to top v 0 is the initial impact velocity the water will just submerge the top surface of body at t t 0 if the water pile up and variation of velocity during impact are ignored according to the results of sun 2007 the maximum impact force appears around such time instants for the actual impact case the body has been completely submerged at t 0 therefore the time t 0 can be regarded as the total time of calculation because the maximum impact force has been obtained before it for different impact case different velocity and body dimension we can use the total step number ns to replace the actual time step dt where the time step dt can be calculated by the following formula 16 d t t 0 n s three different step numbers are used to study the convergence of time step defined as ns 600 1000 and 1400 in addition mesh3 is used to obtain the fluid grid which can avoid the influence of mesh size fig 5 shows the comparison results the influence of time step on the force peak is smaller than the mesh size where the relative error between ns 600 and ns 1400 is about 3 6 while it is about 9 2 for the case of mesh1 and mesh3 however instantaneous impact forces at t 0 12s show obvious difference the impact force at this time instant is caused by jet flow impact which is sensitive to the time step in order to capture the peak of jet flow impact which is important in this paper the total step number ns should be chosen as 1400 3 2 numerical verification in this paper two factors non viscous flow separation and air cavity are our main concerns which should be precisely modeled numerical verifications of them carry out in this part 3 2 1 secondary impact verification the secondary impact caused by separated flow is firstly verified a truncated 3d bow flared model with the size of 1042 mm 667 mm 552 mm from the experiment of xie et al 2018a was utilized to verify the numerical results the water entry of a typical bow flare section in the experiment was simulated four pressure monitoring points p1 p4 were chosen which accords to the positions of p6 p9 in the drop experiment the details of bow flare section and the measuring pressure position are shown in fig 6 a in the experiment the vibrations of falling rig cause oscillations in the forces in addition the difference of 3d model experiment and 2d numerical model may also cause a difference of water entry velocity if free falling motion is adopted in order to avoid these effects we can input the corresponding velocity from the experimental data see fig 6 b into the numerical calculations instead of solving the equation of motion it is noted that three dimensionality of the ship hull is neglected in the 2d simulations which may cause the difference between the model tests and the calculations in fact this part mainly concentrates on whether the present cfd method can model the second impact and whether the pressure peak is similar the discussion of numerical accuracy will be further discussed in section 3 2 2 the comparison result of pressure time history is shown in fig 7 the diameter of pressure sensor in the experiment is 8 mm so the calculated pressure on the same sensor area is averaged to compare the experimental ones two obvious pressure peaks of p1 and p2 are observed where the first impact has less time duration than the second one the first pressure peak is caused by jet flow which is separated from the bulbous bow while the second peak is caused by body extruding water during water entry the first pressure peak p1 and p2 is similar in the magnitude and time of occurrence between numerical and experimental results showing that the predicted pressure caused by jet flow basically agrees with the experimental data such a result reflects that the jet flow impact can be modeled reasonably through present cfd method some differences between the numerical and experimental results can be observed for the pressure at p3 and p4 the secondary impact is not obvious because the first pressure peak is small some differences of pressure amplitude between numerical and experimental results can be observed with about 15 error which mainly comes from the three dimensional effects of truncated 3d bow flared model even so the time of occurrence of impact and the pressure peak is similar reflecting that the presented method can give a reasonable result when predicting this secondary impact phenomenon 3 2 2 air cavity verification in order to verify the capability of modeling air cavity we chose the free surface recorded in the experiment of judge et al 2004 as a reference in the experiment a wedge with deadrise angle 37 is used in the simulation the heel angle of wedge is 5 and the vertical velocity is 3 81 m s as the horizontal velocity 7 62 m s for the asymmetrical water entry case the boundary and fluid domain can refer to the study of xie et al 2018b fig 8 shows the comparison of the free surface for the left side of wedge the cavity can be correctly modeled by our numerical simulation for the right side the water pile up which is the most important fluid characteristic related to the slamming pressure is also accurately modeled we further compare the pressure of wedge entering into water where the experiment of barjasteh et al 2016 is chosen in order to consider the air effect the deadrise angle of wedge is small as possible in there the wedge with deadrise 20 is used and the inclination angle to right side is 5 and 10 respectively in the simulation the length of model is 205 mm with total mass 44 kg the initial vertical velocity is 3 13 m s fig 9 shows the pressure distribution obtained by various methods where the dimensionless quantities showed in the axis are defined as 17 c p 2 p ρ w v 2 18 x 1 x c l where p is the pressure ρ w is the water density v is the water entry velocity x is the horizontal coordinate c l is one half of the wetted length the time corresponds to the instant at which the pressure at p3 comes up to the peak value the length from p3 to keel is 126 mm in the experiment of barjasteh et al 2016 it can be seen that pressure peaks obtained by ocfd and ccfd are close however the pressure distributed at the middle part is a little bigger which will cause more obvious asymmetry in ocfd method the diameter of pressure sensor in the experiments is 6 4 mm therefore the average value of the calculated pressure by numerical method on the same sensor area is used to compare the pressure peak with experiments the comparison between the present method ccfd and experiments has been listed in table 2 the relative error between present method and experimental data on the right side is larger than that on the left side and the maximum error is 15 in addition the pressure peak from sam is 18 larger than the experimental data in fig 9 a and it increases to 40 in fig 9 b in contrast the error of cip method and experimental value is less than 10 in fact the angle between the right side and the calm water level becomes very small due to the inclination angle 15 in figs 9 a and 10 o in fig 9 b the air is easily captured when the wedge impacting water which acts as an air cushion to reduce the impact velocity and thus reduce the pressure on the body for the results of sam it is based on the single flow model so the effect of air cushion is ignored however cip and cfd methods are based on the air water two phase model which can give more reasonable results when the air effect is important 4 results and discussion two impact cases with initial water entry velocities 2 m s and 4 m s are simulated to analyze the falling kinematics where the body drops freely with total mass 400 kg to improve the understanding of obtained results the non dimensional coefficients including velocity acceleration pressure and vertical force are defined as 19 v v t v 0 20 a a t g 21 c p 2 p t ρ w v t 2 22 c f 2 f z t ρ w v t 2 l where ρ w is the density of water l is breadth of bow flared section v 0 is the initial impact velocity and g is the acceleration of gravity as 9 8 m s2 the v a p and f z are the velocity acceleration pressure and vertical force respectively and the v a cp and cf are the corresponding non dimensional coefficients 4 1 velocity and acceleration analysis the comparisons of velocity and acceleration between two models are firstly carried out to clarify the influence of bulbous bow on the falling kinematics fig 10 shows the comparative results in terms of non dimensional velocity in fig 10 a their results are almost same at the early stage t 0 034s however the difference enlarges at the later stage t 0 034s and reaches a maximum at 0 19s the velocity peak in model 1 is 6 2 larger than model 2 in addition the time instant of arriving maximum velocity in model 1 delays about 0 03s than model 2 but they are almost same at t 0 44s which suggests that the velocity of model 1 decreases more quickly in the decline stage in fig 10 b the difference between the two velocities seems to the largest at around 0 16s and the velocity peak in model 1 is 4 1 larger than that in model 2 the acceleration is also compared to further discuss the falling kinematics see fig 11 the maximum acceleration in model 2 is about 16 5 larger than model 1 in the case of initial water entry velocity 2 m s and 19 1 for the case of initial water entry velocity 4 m s for model 1 there are two obvious fluctuations in the increment stage about t 0 034s and t 0 147s see fig 11 a while there are no such fluctuations for model 2 such a consequence can be explained through focusing on the bulbous bow when the bulbous bow firstly touches the water the bottom impact happens which causes the first fluctuation t 0 034s then the fluid is separated from the bulbous bow and hits the body generating a transient impact force which causes the second fluctuation t 0 147s this phenomenon is the so called secondary impact which has been verified by the experimental result of xie et al 2020 another obvious characteristic is that the time instant of acceleration reaching to maximum in model 2 is earlier than the model 1 which means the fluid in model 2 climbs more quickly than model 1 4 2 free surface characteristics the water pile up is an important feature in the water impact problems which is closely related to the slamming loads the evolution of the free surface is discussed in this part fig 12 shows the free surface evolution of model 1 for free falling case with initial water entry velocity 4 m s in fig 12 a the non viscous flow separation occurs nearby the bulbous bow then the separated fluid goes up see fig 12 b until it hits the body surface again fig 12 c after that an air cavity is formed see fig 12 d this air cavity is changing its geometrical shape and moves along the body surface see fig 12 e finally the water submerges the body and separates from the edge of body see fig 12 f fig 13 illustrates the evolution of air water interface for model 2 the water continuously climbs along the body and the jet flow can be clearly observed at the time instants 0 09s and 0 12s quite obvious difference of water pile up caused by bulbous bow can be seen in figs 12 and 13 for example complicated fluid forms including non viscous flow separation and air pocket appear in fig 12 while these phenomena do not occur in fig 13 fig 14 shows the pressure distribution to check the correspondence between the free surface evolution and slamming pressure the time instants accord to those showed in figs 12 and 13 so as to explain the relationship between free surface and slamming pressure the horizontal axis represents the value of z direction see fig 1 b the reason why we do not adopt the y direction as the horizontal axis is that there have multiple same y values at different position in model 1 which cannot guarantee the one to one correspondence of y value and slamming pressure in fig 14 a we can see that the pressure nearby the bulbous bow 0 01m z 0 24m reduces and it even become negative value less than atmospheric pressure at the initial impacting stage t 0 09s the negative pressure area lies nearby the free surface and the pressure becomes positive value with time increasing t 0 12s from the plots in fig 12 a and 12 b air is not attached to the bulb which means pressure increase on the bulb is not due to ventilation but due to the change of the water flow around it after that the high pressure area 0 3m z 0 5m appears when the air cavity is just enclosed t 0 12s the pressure at air cavity area is not zero which can be explained by considering the water pressing the air due to the limitation of 2d model the air cannot escape the body surface is a support boundary of the air pocket and thus bears larger pressure however the pressure on the air pocket 0 3m z 0 4m is smaller than that in the area of water hitting the body 0 4m z 0 5m pressure distribution characteristics of model 2 see fig 14 b are quite different from model 1 for example the pressure increases gradually before the non viscous flow separation t 0 15s and the pressure surrounded by water wetted surface is almost constant when the water just submerges the body t 0 15s the pressure distribution arrives maximum after that t 0 15s the pressure drops quickly 4 3 characteristics of slamming loads slamming loads are often concerned in the ship structure design to discuss the influence of the bulbous bow on the slamming loads comparison analysis of pressure at different positions is carried out the individual pressure comparison is shown in fig 15 the influence of bulbous bow is discussed in the following two parts pressure time history and pressure peak firstly we focus on the characteristic of pressure time history for model 1 pressure at p1 and p2 positions appears two peaks the first 1 at t 0 12s and the other at t 0 16s according to the free surface showed in fig 12 d the first peak is caused by the separated fluid hitting the body jet flow impact the second peak is caused by the body extruding water for model 2 the appearance of pressure is similar to that in the wedge impact where there is only one peak in the time history of pressure in addition the oscillation in model 1 is more obvious than the model 2 the high frequency components in the pressure might be caused by the captured air cavity and this needs to be further proved by more sophisticated analysis then we concentrate on the pressure peak on the one hand the time instant of arriving peak second peak for p1 and p2 in model 1 is delayed about 0 035s than model 2 it indicates that the water in model 1 climbs more slowly which can be seen from the evolution of free surface shown in figs 12 and 13 on the other hand the pressure peaks nearby the bulbous bow model 1 are larger than the case of model 2 with the relative increments of 23 p1 and 34 p2 however the differences of pressure peaks away from bulbous bow reduce to 1 9 p3 2 3 p4 and 0 7 p5 it implies that the bulbous bow increases the local pressure peak nearby it and does not influence the pressure away from it 4 4 discussion of secondary impact phenomenon the main purpose of this part is to improve the ship structure design through discussing the influence of secondary impact phenomenon on the slamming pressure it should be noted that the actual ship slamming is different from the free water entry due to locality of ship slamming for example the velocity peak is 45 larger than the initial impact velocity showed in fig 10 a which does not accord with the fact of actual ship impact because ship motion is hard to be changed by the local impact force that means the variation of velocity between free drop test and actual ship slamming is different for this dilemma non dimensional pressure coefficients are usually used to improve better implications of the obtained results according to the discussion of free surface in section 4 2 and the pressure time history in section 4 3 the water entry velocity is a key factor for the secondary impact it is necessary to discuss its influence on the non dimensional pressure coefficient in order to avoid the influence of acceleration the forced motion of model 1 with constant velocity 4 m s was simulated using the present cfd method the constant water entry problem can be achieved through defining an enormous model mass where the model mass is defined as 5e10kg fig 16 shows the time history of non dimensional pressure coefficient at four positions p1 p4 for model 1 with the constant water entry velocities of 3 m s 6 m s 9 m s and 12 m s the locations of these four monitor points have been shown in fig 1 b the t 0s was unified as the time instant of body just touching the clam water it can be clearly seen that the first pressure peaks at p1 and p2 increase along the velocity rising while the second pressure peak changes a little for p3 and p4 there is only one pressure peak and it has no significant change with velocity it indicates that the influence of water entry velocity on the non dimensional pressure coefficient is significant nearby the junction of bulbous bow and flare section i e p1 and p2 where secondary impact occurs however it becomes inessential when the location is far from the bulbous bow i e p3 and p4 such a result suggests that one should be careful when predicting the impact pressure caused by jet flow first peak through applying a non dimensional pressure coefficient cp in such a case we can still use the non dimensional cp but the cp is not independent of the water entry velocity 5 conclusions the water entry problem of bow flare section considering bulbous bow had been studied numerically the influence of bulbous bow on the slamming loads is investigated through using cfd method which couples a fluid solver and a motion solver the convergence study is firstly carried out through comparing the results obtained by different mesh sizes and time steps for the mesh size calculated result is converged to a constant value when the size ratio of minimum cell and body is less than 0 004 for the time step the result is convergence when the total time steps ns is larger than 1400 then the numerical verifications are carried out through comparing numerical and experimental results the present numerical method correctly modeled the secondary impact and air effect showing good capacity on the prediction of slamming pressure with complicated fluid forms i e non viscous flow separation and air cavity the influence of bulbous bow on some important impact hydrodynamics including water pile up and pressure had been discussed complicated fluid forms including non viscous flow separation and air pocket occur due to the influence of the bulbous bow while these phenomena do not occur when the bulbous bow is cut off these fluid forms further result in the differences of slamming loads the impact in model 1 occurs later about 0 035s than model 2 at the same position and its oscillation of pressure is more obvious in addition pressure peaks of p1 and p2 model 1 are about 30 larger than model 2 while there are no obvious differences at p3 p4 and p5 less than 10 these differences suggest that the bulbous bow can increase the local slamming pressure nearby the junction of bulbous bow and flare section which should be paid more attention in the ship structure design the influence of impact velocity on slamming pressure is further discussed through comparing the non dimensional pressure coefficient in different water entry cases with various impact velocities the results show that the secondary impact is more obvious when the velocity increases in addition the influence of impact velocity is limited to the area nearby the bulbous bow where it is close to the secondary impact area and has less effect on the region away from it results of this study are expected to improve our understanding of the influence of the bulbous bow on slamming loads through systematically comparing the impact hydrodynamic characteristics of these two models the numerical method aims at improving the ship structure design which includes the air effect and non viscous flow separation however 3d effects are important for the secondary impact and air cavity evolution so the study should be generalized to 3d models to improve the application in predicting the slamming loads of 3d ship hull in addition elastic effect is also important for thin wall steel ships and further study can be focused on the coupled effects of the fluid structure responses credit authorship contribution statement hang xie writing original draft fang liu
