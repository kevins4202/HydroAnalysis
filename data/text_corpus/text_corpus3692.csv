18460,sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrification soad implemented in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is a promising alternative to conventional heterotrophic denitrification in mainstream biological nitrogen removal the sulfide oxidation intermediate elemental sulfur is crucial for the kinetic and microbial properties of the sulfur oxidizing bacterial communities but its role is yet to be studied in depth hence to investigate the performance and microbial communities of the aforementioned new biosystem we operated for a long term a laboratory scale 700 d soad mbbr to treat synthetic saline domestic sewage with an increase of the surface loading rate from 8 to 50 mg n m2 h achieved by shortening the hydraulic retention time from 12 h to 2 h the specific reaction rates of the reactor were eventually increased up to 0 37 kg n m3 d and 0 73 kg s m3 d for nitrate reduction and sulfide oxidation with no significant sulfur elemental accumulation two sulfur oxidizing bacterial sob clades sox independent sob sobi and sox dependent sob sobii were responsible for indirect two step sulfur oxidation s2 s0 so4 2 and direct one step sulfur oxidation s2 so4 2 respectively the sobii biomass specific electron transfer capacity could be around 2 5 times greater than that of sobi 38 mmol e gsobii d versus 15 mmol e gsobi d possibly resulting in the selection of sobii over sobi under stress conditions such as a shorter hrt further studies on the methods and mechanism of selecting of sobii over sobi in biofilm reactors are recommended overall the findings shed light on the design and operation of mbbr based soad processes for mainstream biological denitrification graphical abstract image 1 keywords mainstream nitrogen removal sulfur oxidizing bacteria autotrophic denitrification microbial competition picrust 1 introduction the conventional heterotrophic denitrification process has been applied for mainstream nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants for decades ekama and wentzel 2008b however it is crucially limited by the substrate s organic chemical oxygen demand cod hence extra carbon needs to be dosed to nitrogen containing wastewater having low cod which leads to the production of excessive activated sludge waste the above two constraints increase overall operational costs pokorna and zabranska 2015 alternatively inorganic cod e g hydrogen sulfur and iron compounds can be used for autotrophic denitrification which can eliminate the requirement for organic carbon produces less excess sludge and reduces energy required for aeration zhu and getting 2012 cui et al 2019a using free and saline sulfide fss as inorganic cod is practical for mainstream nitrogen removal from the effluent of anaerobic treatment plants moraes et al 2012 wu et al 2016 and industrial wastewater e g wet type flue gas desulfurization wastewater qian et al 2015 and petroleum refining wastewater an et al 2010 to date the sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrification soad process has drawn a lot of attentions in wastewater treatment as reviewed by shao et al 2010 and pokorna and zabranska 2015 in this process researchers have frequently reported the bioproduction and accumulation of the intermediate bioproduced elemental sulfur bps0 from sulfide s2 bps0 manconi et al 2007 huang et al 2015 which can be eventually oxidized into sulfate bps0 so4 2 if provided a sufficient amount of nitrate however in accordance with the previous studies the rate of denitrification driven by bps0 6 37 mg n m2 h could be 2 2 to 6 5 times lower than that driven by sulfide 40 84 mg n m2 h xu et al 2016 cui et al 2019b indicating the bps0 utilization as the rate limiting step from the practical point of view the minimization of bps0 generation is considered as an attractive approach for upgrading soad process the generation of bps0 is affected by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors the extrinsic factors consist of i higher sulfide nitrate mass ratio e g 1 9 g s g n mora et al 2015 as shown in eqs 1 3 ii the higher gibbs free energy of sulfide partial oxidation s2 s0 95 5 kj mol s compared to sulfur oxidation s0 so4 2 91 3 kj mol s moraes et al 2012 iii the lower standard midpoint redox potential of the s2 s0 couple e0 260 mv than that of the s0 so3 2 couple e0 45 mv visser et al 1997 and iv the inhibitory effect of sulfide on

from the effects of different sulfur oxidizing bacterial populations and their physiological properties could be informative for the minimization of s0 production for example some studies have distinguished one group of the sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob from the rest by the ability to direct conversion of sulfide to sulfate without releasing bps0 cui et al 2019b these two sob clades were elucidated with two major divergent sulfide oxidizing enzymatic systems shao et al 2010 some obligate autotrophic sob e g thiobacillus denitrificans and acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans belonging to β and γ proteobacteria ghosh and dam 2009 utilize sox independent mechanism in which a single polypeptide of sulfide quinone reductase sqr klok et al 2012 or the homologue flavocytochrome c fcc griesbeck et al 2002 present in the periplasmic space is used to oxidize sulfide polysulfide into bps0 before it is transported to the cytoplasm and converted to sulfate by dissimilatory sulfate reductase dsr and other oxidative enzymes pott and dahl 1998 other sob could follow the alternative sulfide oxidation approach through the sox dependent pathway which has been widely observed and extensively studied among α and ε proteobacteria e g paracoccus pantotropha and sulfurimonas denitrificans friedrich et al 2005 sievert et al 2008 this group of sob could directly convert sulfide into sulfate via the enzyme complex governed by the sox operon previously both of the two sob clades named sobi and sobii have been simultaneously found in a moving bed biofilm performing soad cui et al 2019b the co occurrence of their competition and cooperation has been elucidated through short term batch experiments but the results are restricted to a limited period and thus cannot be used to accurately predict the response of the microbial community to the variations in operational conditions e g nitrate loading rate and sulfide concentration common in long term plant operation in present work a soad mbbr was continuously operated for 700 d to treat synthetic saline domestic sewage with an increase of surface loading rate by nearly six times from 8 to 50 mg n m2 h which is achieved by shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt also six times i e from 12 to 2 h during this long term experiment analysis were done on the operational performance of this lab scale mbbr the development of moving bed biofilms dynamics of microbial community structures predicted metabolic functions were investigated with the major focus on the analysis of two sob clades called sobi and sob ii of the functional biomass regarding specific sulfide utilization and electron transfer capacity the biomass enzymatic functions with respect to mainly sulfur and nitrogen metabolisms were quantitatively predicted and compared between four different operational phases phase 1 4 overall this study sheds light on the fundamentals of reactor scale performance microbial properties and identifies the best method of facilitating a soad mbbr for full scale application 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up the laboratory scale experimental system was a tightly sealed plexiglas mbbr with an effective volume of 10 l for sulfur oxidizing autotrophic denitrification the moving carriers k3 from anoxkaldnes with the specific surface area of 500 m2 m3 carrier were packed inside the reactor at a filling ratio of 60 as recommended by ødegaard 2016 a mechanical mixer dragon lab beijing china provided constant mixing of 80 10 rpm shear rate of 17 s 1 driving free motion of carriers in the reactor the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater detailed information about the reactor configuration and feeding composition can be found in the supplementary information si the biofilm reactor was continuously operated for 700 d separated into four phases table 1 throughout the operation 30 mg n l of nitrate was supplied in the influent to mimic the low strength nitrogen containing sewage sulfide is a potential inhibitor to aquatic microorganisms hao et al 2013 but thiosulfate is widely accepted as a bioavailable electron donor for cultivation of sob performing sulfide oxidation cardoso et al 2006 mora et al 2015 therefore we decided to synthesize thiosulfate as a part of electron donor 20 at the first place to facilitate the sob biomass growth afterwards influent sulfur compounds were changed from mixed sulfide and thiosulfate to sulfide only while maintaining the same codsulfur no3 n mass ratio of 4 for complete denitrification a number which is close to the reported stoichiometric value 3 86 g codsulfur g n for sulfur oxidizing denitrifiers mora et al 2015 the codsulfur indicates the oxygen demand for complete oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds to sulfate notably in the first 365 d phase 1 and phase 2 sodium sulfide 48 mg s l i e codsulfur 96 mg cod l and sodium thiosulfate 24 mg s l i e codsulfur 48 mg cod l were provided in the influent to imitate the thiosulfate and sulfide containing effluent from sulfate reducing bioreactors hao et al 2013 from day 366 influent thiosulfate was replaced by dissolved sulfide without changing the codsulfur no3 n mass ratio to mimic the sulfur speciation of sulfide containing wastewater 60 mg s l i e codsulfur 120 mg cod l hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 12 h during operation start up phase 1a days 1 60 and gradually reduced to 8 h phase 1b days 61 84 then 4 h phase 2 days 85 365 and phase 3 days 366 435 over the same period the volumetric nitrogen loading rate nlr was adjusted from 0 06 kg n m3 d phase 1a to 0 09 kg n m3 d phase 1b and finally 0 18 kg n m3 d phases 2 and 3 the hrt was further decreased to 2 h at phase 4 together with a doubling of loading rate to 0 36 kg n m3 d 2 2 analytical methods the influent and effluent were sampled two to three times per week from the laboratory scale biofilm system prior to s and n related ionic analysis each sample was passed through a 0 22 μm disposable millipore filter free and saline sulfide was determined immediately after filtration by the methylene blue method apha 2005 and thiosulfate and sulfate ions were later quantified by ion chromatography hic super 20a shimadzu japan nitrate and nitrite concentrations were detected by the standard ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method and colorimetric method respectively apha 2005 ammonium was determined by a flow injection analyzer quikchem 8500 lachat instruments usa the biofilm thickness was determined through gravimetric approach as described in wagner et al 2010 the attached biomass concentrations represented as the attached total solids ats and attached volatile solids avs values can be derived from a modified method of cui et al 2018 2 3 microbial community analysis the seeding activated sludge as indicated by ad 0 was taken from the a tank of the shatin sewage treatment works in hong kong the biofilm samples ad 1 ad 2 ad 3 and ad 4 were the biomass detached by a scalpel from the representative carrier samples collected at day 50 day 360 day 430 and day 700 respectively representing phase 1 to phase 4 of the process for each sample bacterial genomic dna was extracted by the e z n a mag bind soil dna kit omega usa in accordance with the manufacturer s protocol sufficient amount of extracted high quality genomic dna was ensured by using the qubit 2 0 fluorometer coupled with qubit ssdna assay kit thermofisher scientific usa the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the barcode sequences primer pair 515f and 909r table s2 targeting the v4 and v5 hypervariable regions yang et al 2016 the 100 μl pcr reaction mixture contained 5 u of pfu turbo dna polymerase stratagene la jolla ca usa 1x pfu reaction buffer 0 2 mm of dntps takara china 0 1 mm of each barcoded primer and finally 20 ng of genomic dna template pcr was performed under following thermocycling conditions initial denaturation at 94 c for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 94 c for 30 s annealing at 53 c for 30 s extension at 72 c for 45 s and a final extension at 72 c for 10 min the pcr products were then purified using the takara agarose gel dna purification kit takada japan and quantified with nanodrop 200 ng of the purified 16s rrna gene amplicon from the sample was pooled and subjected to amplicon sequencing on the illumina miseq system illumina miseq usa the raw reads were processed using the amplicon sequencing pipeline initial process of the ribosomal database project rdp cole et al 2009 for quality filtering and noise removal claesson et al 2009 the remained sequences were than aligned and clustered into operational taxonomic units otus 97 similarity using mothur rarefaction curves and the diversity indices ace and chao 1 were determined based on the calculated otus by mothur shannon simpson as well as species richness were calculated according to the procedures described in huang et al 2015 and chen et al 2017 the taxonomic classification was assigned using the rdp classifier wang et al 2007 the metabolic dynamics of the biofilm microbial communities were predicted by the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust li et al 2017 according to the online protocol of picrust pipeline additionally the functions belonging to metabolism and energy metabolism and the functional genes related to nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms were predicted to evaluate bioactivities of sulfur oxidizing moving bed biofilms at molecular level 2 4 specific activities determination via batch tests to examine the dynamics of the mbbr capacities for utilizing sulfide for mainstream denitrification during long term operation both sulfide and nitrate conversions were determined via ex situ batch tests in phase 1a phase 2 phase 3 and phase 4 with requisite biofilm samples for these tests taken on day 50 day 350 day 430 and day 700 respectively the batch experimental system was assigned in accordance with our previous study in which the kinetic characterization of sob biofilms was successfully analyzed cui et al 2019b considering that both elemental sulfur and sulfate could be generated during fss oxidation mora et al 2015 both rates of fss oxidation fss s0 so4 2 and sulfate generation fss so4 2 were determined through batch experimental analysis the carrier surface specific and biomass specific substrate conversion rates indicate the reactor scale maximal treatment capacity and biomass scale biofilm metabolic bioactivity respectively these specific rates for fss oxidation sulfate generation and denitrification were determined through linear regression of the specific fss concentrations fss i where i refers to the sampling time h sulfate so4 i nitrate no3 i mg s l or mg n l versus time h divided by the specific surface area m2 l or the specific attached biomass concentration mg avs l respectively all regression coefficients r2 were greater than 0 9 with p 0 05 the surface specific and biomass specific electron transfer rates mmole e m2 h and mmole e gavs h can be converted from the corresponding fss oxidation rate by multiplying the nominal electron donation factor i e 2 mmol e 32 mg fssoxidized for partial oxidation fss s0 or 8 mmol e 32 mg fssoxidized for complete oxidation fss so4 2 it should be noted that the estimated active attached biomass concentrations of different sob clades were incorporated into the biomass specific substrate conversion rates 2 5 active attached biomass estimation the active biomass of the sob biofilm system can be estimated based on equations 4 6 simplified from ekama and wentzel 2008a 4 m x b a v f a b a s r t m x e a v 5 m x i v f x i v i s r t 6 m x b a v m

of genera of two biosamples with a p value of 0 05 taken to indicate the statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance the performance of the sob mbbr is shown in fig 1 and table 2 this laboratory scale biofilm reactor was initially seeded with activated sludge and fresh carriers for the cultivation of soad moving bed biofilms after consistent mixing for 48 h under anaerobic condition the influent containing nitrate 30 mg n l thiosulfate 24 mg s l and sulfide 48 mg s l was slowly fed into the system with an initial hydraulic retention time of 12 h phase 1a nitrate concentration in the effluent started to decrease by 10 20 mg n l over the first several days and denitrification efficiency increased to 83 8 during the latter period days 10 60 fig 1a next phase 1b days 61 84 the influent flowrate was increased from 20 to 30 l d as a result of decreasing the reactor hrt to 8 h both the nitrate and sulfide removal efficiencies as well as their respective volumetric removal rates were increased to 90 9 and 100 and 0 08 0 01 kg n m3 d and 0 14 0 02 kg s m3 d respectively fig 1a the sulfur balance was further increased to 98 with the molar ratio of e donated e accepted in the range of 1 44 1 52 mmol e donated mmole e accepted fig 1c the system was next moved to phase 2 with the hrt decreased to 4 h it is impressive that this resulted in a doubling in the denitrification capacity of the biofilms and a volumetric nitrogen loading rate increase from 0 09 to 0 18 kg n m3 d without any lag phase in addition nearly all sulfide and thiosulfate species were oxidized to sulfate as demonstrated by the sulfur balance being approximately 101 at this time the ratio of e donated e accepted was maintained at about 1 49 mmol e donated mmole e accepted confirming that system performance and operation remained stable notably the reactor was successfully operated over one year initially phases 1 and 2 it was fed with mixed sulfur compounds i e sulfide and thiosulfate while in the latter stages phase 3 and 4 thiosulfate in the supplied synthetic wastewater was replaced by dissolved sulfide to mimic the microbial niche of only sulfide containing sewage in phase 3 the hrt was decreased to 4 h sulfide oxidation capacity of the biofilms was further increased to 0 36 0 05 kg s m3 d and nitrate reduction was maintained at a similar reaction rate 0 17 0 02 kg n m3 d to that of phase 2 in phase 4 the reactor hrt was further decreased to 2 h corresponding to greater nitrogen and sulfide loading rates of 0 36 kg n m3 d and 0 72 kg s m3 d the nitrogen removal efficiency was further elevated to 98 2 and the sulfur balance ratio was found at approximately 97 the high efficiencies on sulfide and thiosulfate utilization during the operation indicate the complete conversion of all the reduced sulfur compounds i e thiosulfate and sulfide from influent into sulfate in the sob biofilm system the electron balance shows that the molar ratio of e donated e accepted remained in the range of 1 45 1 47 the released electrons from the reduced sulfur compounds were assigned for either dissimilatory denitrification or assimilatory biomass synthesis as a result the amount of electron donated was always higher than the amount of electron accepted with the difference being the portion for biomass synthesis the results proved the continuous stable operation of this lab scale mbbr through a further 300 d for mainstream denitrification driven by sulfide electrons codsulfide this short hrt 2 h is comparable with that used in a conventional heterotrophic denitrification unit ekama and wentzel 2008b and has been demonstrated in this study to enable higher denitrification capacity this is especially notable when compared with other soad processes for municipal wastewater and or surface water treatment table 3 as these all achieved lower nitrogen removal rates 0 03 0 31 kg n m3 d than those achieved in our previous study despite using longer hrts 3 4 40 h 3 2 development of moving bed biofilms the development of the moving bed biofilms over a 700 d operational period is depicted in fig 1d the corresponding specific activities of biofilms were determined in ex situ batch experiments and the results are shown in fig 2 the attached biomass stayed in continuous growth of 0 33 0 05 g avs l at day 10 phase 1a to 0 83 0 12 g avs l at day 84 the end of phase 1b illustrating the rapid growth of sob biomass and indicating that the biofilms colonized the surface of moving bed carriers the amount of suspended solids in the bulk liquid of the mbbr was much lower 22 5 mg vss l compared to the amount of attached biomass as a result of the hrt being reduced to 4 h in phase 2 the attached biomass concentration was increased to 1 32 0 09 g avs l after changing the types of reduced sulfur compounds that were supplied the biofilm concentrations were maintained at about 1 32 0 02 and 2 08 0 14 g avs l in phase 3 and 4 respectively the calculated sludge yield coefficient of the moving bed biofilms varied from 0 44 g vs g n at phase 1a to 0 58 g vs g n at phase 4 which is close to the range reported previously 0 15 0 57 g vs g n manconi et al 2007 yang et al 2016 the mbbr can efficiently accelerate the immobilization of functional sob communities and protect the slow growth autotrophs from being washed out this unique feature meets the stability of soad process in mainstream nitrogen removal and supports the mbbr as an appealing option compared to some other soad biosystems which may demonastrate relative restricted denitrification rate e g s0 driven packed bed bioreactor or may lead to unexpected biomass loss during operation e g suspended sludge system the biofilm thickness was rapidly increased to 92 1 μm at the end of phase 1 and it was observed in the range between 118 and 128 μm during phase 2 and 3 and 153 19 μm in phase 4 always lower than the critical value of 200 μm for biofilm mass transfer limitation cui et al 2018 hence there will not be much of negative impact on the mass transfer and reactor performance as eventhough the nlr was doubled in phase 4 the effluent qualities have not deteriorated it is also interesting to find that the volumetric nlr could be linearly correlated with biofilm attached biomass concentrations as shown in fig s2 and table s1 this result implies that nlr is one of the key factors affecting biofilm growth and this work shows that the hydrodynamic and substrate loading conditions concurrently regulate the formation of the moving bed biofilms and effective reactive regime the biofilm gradually developed into a compact and effective ecological bacterial matrix enabling sulfide driven autotrophic mainstream denitrification the specific biofilm activities of autotrophic denitrification which were determined through batch tests were found to be 18 35 mg n m2 h at phase 1a and 76 15 mg n m2 h at phase 2 afterwards the surface specific nitrogen loading rates were 25 and 50 mg n m2 h at phase 3 and 4 fig 2a corresponding to the surface specific denitrification rates of 63 83 and 147 77 mg n m2 h respectively the lower rate in phase 3 compared to phase 2 was plausibly caused by the increase of the sulfide concentration by 25 table 2 the surface specific sulfate production rates increased significantly from 5 94 mg s m2 h at phase 1a to 145 mg s m2 h at phase 4 but sulfate generation was constantly lower than sulfide oxidation in the batch tests due to the bioaccumulation of elemental sulfur s0 and its relative lower oxidation rate compared to sulfide oxidation our previous study cui et al 2019b suggested two clades of sobs sox independent sob sobi and sox dependent sob sobii performing indirect two step sulfide oxidation s2 s0 so4 2 with potentially producing intermediate s0 and direct sulfide oxidation s2 so4 2 respectively more information about the two sob clades will be provided in the following sections 3 3 microbial community dynamics and diversity in soad moving bed biofilms 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to determine the relative abundance and diversity of the bacterial population among the seeding activated sludge ad 0 and the four biosamples ad 1 to ad 4 taken from the bioreactor the parameters of the similarity based otus and species richness and diversity estimates of microbial communities were determined table s3 as shown in fig 3 a visualized by using circos krzywinski et al 2009 the dynamic changes of all biosamples regarding microbial community structure at class level were presented as documented in literatures all sob are documented under proteobacterial classes as reviewed by shao et al 2010 the sobi clade which follows the sox independent sulfide oxidation pathway consists of β and γ proteobacteria sob shao et al 2010 in present study the proportions of both β and γ proteobacteria continuously increased from 2 38 to 11 95 in seeding sludge ad 0 to 21 29 and 30 40 in ad 2 biofilm sample phase 2 respectively and persisted in similar proportions 19 66 26 91 in the rest operation the sobii clade which follows sox sulfide oxidation pathway consists α and ε proteobacteria sob ghosh and dam 2009 shao et al 2010 compared to the seeding sludge the proportion of α proteobacteria increased by 1 5 times to 21 27 in ad 1 phase 1 and remained at 19 93 in ad 2 biosample this value interestingly further increased to 26 31 in ad 3 phase 3 but eventually declined by nearly half 13 98 in ad 4 phase 4 the ε proteobacteria presented a similar trend to that of α proteobacteria among the communities of ad 2 0 36 ad 3 11 22 and ad 4 6 91 the δ proteobacteria mainly comprising sulfate reducing bacteria srb persisted at a proportion of 12 1 16 8 during most of the long term operation except during sulfide inhibition depression in phase 3 when the δ proteobacteria proportion rapidly decreased to approximately 5 the enrichment of srb indicates that they can also play an important role in the development and evolution of sob biofilms guo et al 2016 the organics utilized for srb are plausibly from the cell endogenous decay in the biofilms flavobacteria and ignavibacteria were also detected with the relative abundances of 6 56 11 and 0 26 7 in the biofilm samples respectively they have been observed with noticeable amount 1 in other soad granular and suspended sludge systems yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 however their functions in soad process still need further investigation fig 3b illustrates the phylogenetic taxa at the genus level with a relative abundance greater than 1 genus paracoccus has been frequently reported in the denitrification biosystems driven by diverse electron donors e g organic carbons reduced sulfur compounds and h2 friedrich et al 2005 its representative species paracoccus denitrificans and p pantotropha were confirmed to mediate the sox pathway for sulfide oxidation kelly et al 1997 sauvé et al 2007 in the present study this genus gradually grew to comprise a significant proportion of the biofilms from 0 37 in ad 0 to 12 44 in ad 3 before decreasing to a proportion of 2 33 when encountering higher sulfide flux at phase 4 the enrichment of otu 26 and otu 12 fig 3c which are highly likely to be assignable to p denitrificans and p pantotropha confirmed the dynamic change of paracoccus levels of genus maribius from the same family rhodobacteraceae of paracoccus were also slowly enriched from 0 02 at the beginning to 7 87 at ad 4 proportions of otu 11 and the phylogenetic related otu 7136 which may belong to genus maribius also increased fig 3c the influent has been volumetrically synthesized using 20 seawater which could facilitate enrichment of some marine sulfur oxidizing bacteria e g maribius salinus in this moving bed biofilm system however the reasons for this dominance of maribius require further investigation genus sulfurimonas began to become dominant at ad 3 11 12 compared to ad 2 0 35 however it declined to 6 82 at ad 4 sulfurimonas denitrificans which could be assigned to one of the detected subunits otu 124 otu 30 and otu 89 fig 3c has been recognized to possess sox pathway for sulfide oxidation sievert et al 2008 the genera paracoccus and sulfurimonas had similar trends in dynamics of relative abundances to other members of the sobii clade fig 3c thus making them members of this clade the genera sedimenticola and thiolapillus are marine sob that were originally isolated from hydrothermal ecosystems nunoura et al 2014 flood et al 2015 in our system they increased to represent significant proportions of ad 1 19 64 and 5 67 respectively from initially negligible levels 0 01 0 1 at ad 0 based on the phylogenetic analysis of 50 most abundant otus fig 3c sedimenticola otu 0 and thiolapillus otu 58 and otu 125 exhibited the distinctive capacity to rapidly occupy the carrier surface in this particular environment which is in line with the known behavior of sob in granular sludge systems guo et al 2016 however the proportions of otu 0 and otu 58 and otu 125 slowly decreased 7 14 and 1 18 respectively at ad 4 showing their inability to persist during long term system operation otu 1 and otu 5 are possible species e g thiobacillus denitrificans from genus thiobacillus which are commonly reported as capable of aerobic and anaerobic biological sulfide oxidation lan et al 2019 the proportions of these species increased from 0 05 at ad 1 to 12 01 at ad 2 and the eventually stabilized at 16 62 at ad 4 some species of genera thiohalobacter e g thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus and thioalbus e g thioalbus denitrificans have been isolated from marine sediments and shown the ability to reduce nitrogen by oxidizing sulfur zhu and getting 2012 in our system it was interesting to note that proportions of both genera thiohalobacter otu 16 and otu 1736 and thioalbus otu 18 rapidly increased from trace levels 0 0 61 in initial biofilms ad 1 to significant levels 6 68 7 48 in mature biofilms ad 4 mirroring the dynamic changes also demonstrated by thiobacillus some genera of the sobi clade e g sedimenticola and thiolapillus were observed to rapidly colonize the carrier surface during the start up phase but then decreased in the follow up phases at which point other genera of sobi e g thiobacillus thiohalobacter and thioalbus would arise and multiply over the long term operation of the system fig 3b more diverse sob were observed in this study is possible due to the addition of 20 of real seawater 3 4 co occurrence of sobi and sobii the active sobi and sobii biomass concentration in the biofilm could be calculated by using a simplified steady state model equation as shown in si based on these predicted values the corresponded sobi and sobii bacterial relative abundances were also calculated the results are shown in fig 4 a both sobi and sobii were successfully cultivated from seeding sludge and grown on the moving beds at phase 1 ad 1 with the attached biomass concentrations i e active sob biomass of 76 mg sobi l and 47 mg sobii l respectively the attached sobi biomass concentration gradually increased to over 400 mg sobi l at phase 2 ad 2 and declining by 11 354 mg sobi l at phase 3 ad 3 which is in line with the dynamics of sobi fractions during phase 4 the attached sobi biomass concentration was nearly doubled to 652 mg sobi l compared to that of phase 3 possibly due to increased substrate loads rather than sobi bacterial enrichment table 1 thus it can be seen that an effective sobi active biomass is able to accumulate during long term operation and a stable relative abundance of sobi is maintained the sobii biomass was observed to constantly increase from ad 1 to ad 3 but was always present in lower concentrations relative to sobi the significant build up of sobii biomass from 157 mg sobii l at ad 2 to 298 mg sobii l at ad 3 indicates that a sulfide stimulation 25 increase in sulfide concentration at this point could assist in biomass growth fig 4a these data are in agreement with the observed trend of sobii relative abundance although the relative fraction of sobii among all the microbial community has been depressed by nearly half to 20 89 due to the intense competition with other sob for spatial and energy demanding advantages at phase 4 the sobii biomass concentration was interestingly maintained at 296 4 mg sobii l throughout phase 3 and 4 these findings demonstrate the divergent trends between the bacterial cell growth and microbial community evolution of each sob clade during long term mbbr operation to further explain microbial competition and to yield more insight into their evolutionary impact on soad process the specific bioactivities of the two communities for sulfide utilization and electron transfer capacity were evaluated in a manner akin to that reported in the literature visser et al 1997 the competition between sobi and sobii over fss free and saline sulfide utilization and electron transfer capacity at reactor scale was compared by means of evaluating their carrier surface specific rates fig 4b and c as mentioned above the sulfate generation rate and the difference between the overall fss utilization rate and the sulfate generation rate from the bioactivity tests were used to indicate the sobii and sobi fss utilization rates respectively fig 4b shows that sobii exhibited a far lower surface specific fss utilization rate than that of sobi as the fss utilization rate of sobii amounted to only 4 28 of that of sobi even though the sobii rate continuously increased by 24 4 times from phase 1 to 4 however sobii displayed superior electron transfer capacity in this biofilm system as shown in fig 4c the sobii surface specific electron transfer rate increased from 1 49 to 36 25 mmol e m2 h and even contributed greater capacity than sobi at phase 4 from the perspective of reactor performance sulfide was mainly consumed by sobi 78 96 during all phases but sobii exhibited increasing and ultimately greater ability than sobi for oxidative electron transfer from sulfide consumption over long term operation of the system as illustrated in fig 4d and e the competition between sobi and sobii over fss utilization and electron transfer capacity at biomass scale was compared by means of analyzing their corresponding biomass specific rates interestingly we discovered that the sobi biomass specific fss utilization rate decreased continuously from phase 1 to phase 4 from 599 to 242 mg s g sobi h conversely the corresponding sobii biomass specific fss utilization rate increased continuously except for a temporary decline at phase 3 which was possibly caused by sulfide inhibition the analysis of biomass specific electron transfer further illustrated the difference in their activity profiles with sobii exhibited an almost 2 5 times greater electron transfer per gram of sob than sobi at phase 4 fig 4e this finding indicates the activity of sobii rather than that of sobi could be enhanced during soad over long term stable operation which suggest further avenues for the improvement of biomass treatment capacity 3 5 metabolism functional prediction to gain insight into the molecular functions of bacteria across all five biosamples phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was applied to predict changes to nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms by imputing the available annotated genes within the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg catalogue as visualized by using circos in fig 5 a and b the functional genes related to the nitrogen microtransformations of denitrification dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonia dnra assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia nitrogen fixation and nitrification were all selected to visualize the bacterial community evolutions at the molecular level pauleta et al 2013 as shown in fig 5a the predicted proportions of the four related denitrification enzymes dissimilatory nitrate no3 reductase nitrite no2 reductase nitric oxide no reductase and nitrous oxide n2o reductase were presented between all the five biosamples the no3 reductases which are represented by ec 1 7 5 1 k00370 narg k00371 narh and k00374 nari and ec 1 7 99 4 k02567 napa and k02568 napb was shown in ad 1 with a level of 10 85 and was increased to a maximal level of 13 53 in ad 2 and then stabilized at approximately 9 61 11 73 in ad 3 and 4 the no reductases represented by ec 1 7 2 5 k04561 norb and k02305 norc showed a similar changing profile with dissimilatory nitrate reductases though they were most abundant in ad 3 8 27 rather than ad 0 1 70 in contrast the proportions of both no2 reductases and n2o reductases which were represented by ec 1 7 2 1 k00368 nirk and ec 1 7 2 4 k00376 nosz respectively did not significantly alter until ad 3 when greater abundances 2 83 and 3 10 respectively were observed the overall reactor performance and kinetic experiments demonstrate the increasing denitrification capacity of the soad moving bed biofilms during operation however the corresponding enzymatic activities may not be enhanced as the predicted relevant denitrification genes were not found constantly to display increasing abundances the nitrate loads may lead to the prevalence of no3 and no reductases whilst higher sulfide concentration in phase 3 may stimulate no2 no and n2o reductases and inhibit no3 reductases in this situation the net result over long term stable operation ad 4 would be a reduction in the activity of all reductases this may result from physiological alteration e g endogenous respiration extracellular polymeric substance secretion conthe et al 2019 and the evolution of phylogenetic distribution e g growth of srb fig 3b predicted changes in functional genes associated with sulfur conversion are further illustrated in fig 5b including assimilatory sulfate reduction dissimilatory sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation the kegg database currently lack of annotated sequences for sox and sulfide quinone reductase sqr enzymatic systems the prediction for sulfur oxidizing enzymes can only proceed over dissimilatory sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation reversible bioreactions can be mediated by sulfur involving enzymes shared by both dissimilatory sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation pott and dahl 1998 in the biological sulfide oxidation sulfide is converted into sulfite and further into sulfate via adenosylphosphosulfate aps with the aid of dissimilatory sulfate reductases dsr ec 1 8 99 5 adenylylsulfate reductase apr ec 1 8 99 2 and sulfate adenylyltransferase sat ec 2 7 7 4 in this study both subunits of dsr k11180 dsra and k11181 dsrb were more abundant in mature biofilms ad 2 to ad 4 with proportions of 4 25 5 54 which are nearly two times greater than those in the seeding sludge ad 0 and the biofilm at start up phase ad 1 fig 5b overall the results of functional prediction show that the changes of subcategories under metabolism including energy metabolism carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism between all biosamples were not statistically significant p 0 05 but the results indicate the metabolic divergence between sulfur and nitrogen metabolisms as compared to seeding sludge the predicted sulfide oxidation enzymes in biofilm samples were increased but denitrification enzymes were maintained at similar values this implies the potential overcapacity of functional sulfur oxidizing enzymes conthe et al 2019 which allows for greater influent sulfide loading rate hence an even shorter hrt i e 1 h may also be feasible which would be worthwhile verifying in future studies 4 conclusions this study revealed several aspects underpinning the shift in structure and function of microbial communities performing sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrification in a mbbr with the results allowing the following conclusions to be drawn the long term stability of the mbbr system was verified with over 700 d continuous stable operation with over 98 of nitrate reduction and 100 of dissolved sulfide conversion achieved resulting in nitrate and sulfide removal rates of 0 37 kg n m3 d and 0 73 kg s m3 d respectively under low hrt 2 h operational condition the s n ratio is about 2 0 gs gn which is close to the experimental value of 1 9 gs gn for complete sulfide oxidation resulting in no accumulation of elemental sulfur s0 in biofilms the maximal biofilm activities for sulfide partial oxidation and denitrification determined in batch experiments were 667 mg s m2 h and 148 mg n m2 h respectively which were reached with over 2 1 g l of attached volatile solids of the biofilm system and reactor hrt at 2 h moreover the nitrogen loading rates could linearly enhanced the biofilm attached biomass concentrations sob communities were detected in diverse taxa some sobi genera e g sedimenticola and thiolapillus rapidly colonized the carrier surface at start up while other sobi genera e g thiobacillus thiohalobacter and thioalbus began to thrive in the later stages of the process the increase in sobii genera e g paracoccus and sulfurimonas was stimulated by sulfide but could be depressed over long term operation moreover the sobii biomass specific electron transfer capacity was eventually almost 2 5 times greater than that of sobi 38 mmol e gsobii d v s 15 mmol e gsobi d indicating sobii is selected under stress conditions such as a shorter hrt further studies on the methods and mechanism of selecting of sobii over sobi in biofilm reactors are recommended picrust was employed to analyze the sulfide oxidizing biofilms performing mainstream denitrification to predict microbial functions and the sulfur and nitrogen metabolic pathways based on the information in the kegg database the specific functions associated with sobi and sobii should be investigated by metagenomic

18460,sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrification soad implemented in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is a promising alternative to conventional heterotrophic denitrification in mainstream biological nitrogen removal the sulfide oxidation intermediate elemental sulfur is crucial for the kinetic and microbial properties of the sulfur oxidizing bacterial communities but its role is yet to be studied in depth hence to investigate the performance and microbial communities of the aforementioned new biosystem we operated for a long term a laboratory scale 700 d soad mbbr to treat synthetic saline domestic sewage with an increase of the surface loading rate from 8 to 50 mg n m2 h achieved by shortening the hydraulic retention time from 12 h to 2 h the specific reaction rates of the reactor were eventually increased up to 0 37 kg n m3 d and 0 73 kg s m3 d for nitrate reduction and sulfide oxidation with no significant sulfur elemental accumulation two sulfur oxidizing bacterial sob clades sox independent sob sobi and sox dependent sob sobii were responsible for indirect two step sulfur oxidation s2 s0 so4 2 and direct one step sulfur oxidation s2 so4 2 respectively the sobii biomass specific electron transfer capacity could be around 2 5 times greater than that of sobi 38 mmol e gsobii d versus 15 mmol e gsobi d possibly resulting in the selection of sobii over sobi under stress conditions such as a shorter hrt further studies on the methods and mechanism of selecting of sobii over sobi in biofilm reactors are recommended overall the findings shed light on the design and operation of mbbr based soad processes for mainstream biological denitrification graphical abstract image 1 keywords mainstream nitrogen removal sulfur oxidizing bacteria autotrophic denitrification microbial competition picrust 1 introduction the conventional heterotrophic denitrification process has been applied for mainstream nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants for decades ekama and wentzel 2008b however it is crucially limited by the substrate s organic chemical oxygen demand cod hence extra carbon needs to be dosed to nitrogen containing wastewater having low cod which leads to the production of excessive activated sludge waste the above two constraints increase overall operational costs pokorna and zabranska 2015 alternatively inorganic cod e g hydrogen sulfur and iron compounds can be used for autotrophic denitrification which can eliminate the requirement for organic carbon produces less excess sludge and reduces energy required for aeration zhu and getting 2012 cui et al 2019a using free and saline sulfide fss as inorganic cod is practical for mainstream nitrogen removal from the effluent of anaerobic treatment plants moraes et al 2012 wu et al 2016 and industrial wastewater e g wet type flue gas desulfurization wastewater qian et al 2015 and petroleum refining wastewater an et al 2010 to date the sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrification soad process has drawn a lot of attentions in wastewater treatment as reviewed by shao et al 2010 and pokorna and zabranska 2015 in this process researchers have frequently reported the bioproduction and accumulation of the intermediate bioproduced elemental sulfur bps0 from sulfide s2 bps0 manconi et al 2007 huang et al 2015 which can be eventually oxidized into sulfate bps0 so4 2 if provided a sufficient amount of nitrate however in accordance with the previous studies the rate of denitrification driven by bps0 6 37 mg n m2 h could be 2 2 to 6 5 times lower than that driven by sulfide 40 84 mg n m2 h xu et al 2016 cui et al 2019b indicating the bps0 utilization as the rate limiting step from the practical point of view the minimization of bps0 generation is considered as an attractive approach for upgrading soad process the generation of bps0 is affected by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors the extrinsic factors consist of i higher sulfide nitrate mass ratio e g 1 9 g s g n mora et al 2015 as shown in eqs 1 3 ii the higher gibbs free energy of sulfide partial oxidation s2 s0 95 5 kj mol s compared to sulfur oxidation s0 so4 2 91 3 kj mol s

from the effects of different sulfur oxidizing bacterial populations and their physiological properties could be informative for the minimization of s0 production for example some studies have distinguished one group of the sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob from the rest by the ability to direct conversion of sulfide to sulfate without releasing bps0 cui et al 2019b these two sob clades were elucidated with two major divergent sulfide oxidizing enzymatic systems shao et al 2010 some obligate autotrophic sob e g thiobacillus denitrificans and acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans belonging to β and γ proteobacteria ghosh and dam 2009 utilize sox independent mechanism in which a single polypeptide of sulfide quinone reductase sqr klok et al 2012 or the homologue flavocytochrome c fcc griesbeck et al 2002 present in the periplasmic space is used to oxidize sulfide polysulfide into bps0 before it is transported to the cytoplasm and converted to sulfate by dissimilatory sulfate reductase dsr and other oxidative enzymes pott and dahl 1998 other sob could follow the alternative sulfide oxidation approach through the sox dependent pathway which has been widely observed and extensively studied among α and ε proteobacteria e g paracoccus pantotropha and sulfurimonas denitrificans friedrich et al 2005 sievert et al 2008 this group of sob could directly convert sulfide into sulfate via the enzyme complex governed by the sox operon previously both of the two sob clades named sobi and sobii have been simultaneously found in a moving bed biofilm performing soad cui et al 2019b the co occurrence of their competition and cooperation has been elucidated through short term batch experiments but the results are restricted to a limited period and thus cannot be used to accurately predict the response of the microbial community to the variations in operational conditions e g nitrate loading rate and sulfide concentration common in long term plant operation in present work a soad mbbr was continuously operated for 700 d to treat synthetic saline domestic sewage with an increase of surface loading rate by nearly six times from 8 to 50 mg n m2 h which is achieved by shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt also six times i e from 12 to 2 h during this long term experiment analysis were done on the operational performance of this lab scale mbbr the development of moving bed biofilms dynamics of microbial community structures predicted metabolic functions were investigated with the major focus on the analysis of two sob clades called sobi and sob ii of the functional biomass regarding specific sulfide utilization and electron transfer capacity the biomass enzymatic functions with respect to mainly sulfur and nitrogen metabolisms were quantitatively predicted and compared between four different operational phases phase 1 4 overall this study sheds light on the fundamentals of reactor scale performance microbial properties and identifies the best method of facilitating a soad mbbr for full scale application 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up the laboratory scale experimental system was a tightly sealed plexiglas mbbr with an effective volume of 10 l for sulfur oxidizing autotrophic denitrification the moving carriers k3 from anoxkaldnes with the specific surface area of 500 m2 m3 carrier were packed inside the reactor at a filling ratio of 60 as recommended by ødegaard 2016 a mechanical mixer dragon lab beijing china provided constant mixing of 80 10 rpm shear rate of 17 s 1 driving free motion of carriers in the reactor the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater detailed information about the reactor configuration and feeding composition can be found in the supplementary information si the biofilm reactor was continuously operated for 700 d separated into four phases table 1 throughout the operation 30 mg n l of nitrate was supplied in the influent to mimic the low strength nitrogen containing sewage sulfide is a potential inhibitor to aquatic microorganisms hao et al 2013 but thiosulfate is widely accepted as a bioavailable electron donor for cultivation of sob performing sulfide oxidation cardoso et al 2006 mora et al 2015 therefore we decided to synthesize thiosulfate as a part of electron donor 20 at the first place to facilitate the sob biomass growth afterwards influent sulfur compounds were changed from mixed sulfide and thiosulfate to sulfide only while maintaining the same codsulfur no3 n mass ratio of 4 for complete denitrification a number which is close to the reported stoichiometric value 3 86 g codsulfur g n for sulfur oxidizing denitrifiers mora et al 2015 the codsulfur indicates the oxygen demand for complete oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds to sulfate notably in the first 365 d phase 1 and phase 2 sodium sulfide 48 mg s l i e codsulfur 96 mg cod l and sodium thiosulfate 24 mg s l i e codsulfur 48 mg cod l were provided in the influent to imitate the thiosulfate and sulfide containing effluent from sulfate reducing bioreactors hao et al 2013 from day 366 influent thiosulfate was replaced by dissolved sulfide without changing the codsulfur no3 n mass ratio to mimic the sulfur speciation of sulfide containing wastewater 60 mg s l i e codsulfur 120 mg cod l hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 12 h during operation start up phase 1a days 1 60 and gradually reduced to 8 h phase 1b days 61 84 then 4 h phase 2 days 85 365 and phase 3 days 366 435 over the same period the volumetric nitrogen loading rate nlr was adjusted from 0 06 kg n m3 d phase 1a to 0 09 kg n m3 d phase 1b and finally 0 18 kg n m3 d phases 2 and 3 the hrt was further decreased to 2 h at phase 4 together with a doubling of loading rate to 0 36 kg n m3 d 2 2 analytical methods the influent and effluent were sampled two to three times per week from the laboratory scale biofilm system prior to s and n related ionic analysis each sample was passed through a 0 22 μm disposable millipore filter free and saline sulfide was determined immediately after filtration by the methylene blue method apha 2005 and thiosulfate and sulfate ions were later quantified by ion chromatography hic super 20a shimadzu japan nitrate and nitrite concentrations were detected by the standard ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method and colorimetric method respectively apha 2005 ammonium was determined by a flow injection analyzer quikchem 8500 lachat instruments usa the biofilm thickness was determined through gravimetric approach as described in wagner et al 2010 the attached biomass concentrations represented as the attached total solids ats and attached volatile solids avs values can be derived from a modified method of cui et al 2018 2 3 microbial community analysis the seeding activated sludge as indicated by ad 0 was taken from the a tank of the shatin sewage treatment works in hong kong the biofilm samples ad 1 ad 2 ad 3 and ad 4 were the biomass detached by a scalpel from the representative carrier samples collected at day 50 day 360 day 430 and day 700 respectively representing phase 1 to phase 4 of the process for each

ensured by using the qubit 2 0 fluorometer coupled with qubit ssdna assay kit thermofisher scientific usa the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the barcode sequences primer pair 515f and 909r

followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 94 c for 30 s annealing at 53 c for 30 s extension at 72 c for 45 s and a final extension at 72 c for 10 min the pcr products were then purified using the takara agarose gel dna purification kit takada japan and quantified with nanodrop 200 ng of the purified 16s rrna gene amplicon from the sample was pooled and subjected to amplicon sequencing on the illumina miseq system illumina miseq usa the raw reads were processed using the amplicon sequencing pipeline initial process of the ribosomal database project rdp cole et al 2009 for quality filtering and noise removal claesson et al 2009 the remained sequences were than aligned and clustered into operational taxonomic units otus 97 similarity using mothur rarefaction curves and the diversity indices ace and chao 1 were determined based on the calculated otus by mothur shannon simpson as well as species richness were calculated according to the procedures described in huang et al 2015 and chen et al 2017 the taxonomic classification was assigned using the rdp classifier wang et al 2007 the metabolic dynamics of the biofilm microbial communities were predicted by the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust li et al 2017 according to the online protocol of picrust pipeline additionally the functions belonging to metabolism and energy metabolism and the functional genes related to nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms were predicted to evaluate bioactivities of sulfur oxidizing moving bed biofilms at molecular level 2 4 specific activities determination via batch tests to examine the dynamics of the mbbr capacities for utilizing sulfide for mainstream denitrification during long term operation both sulfide and nitrate conversions were determined via ex situ batch tests in phase 1a phase 2 phase 3 and phase 4 with requisite biofilm samples for these tests taken on day 50 day 350 day 430 and day 700 respectively the batch experimental system was assigned in accordance with our previous study in which the kinetic characterization of sob biofilms was successfully analyzed cui et al 2019b considering that both elemental sulfur and sulfate could be generated during fss oxidation mora et al 2015 both rates of fss oxidation fss s0 so4 2 and sulfate generation fss so4 2 were determined through batch experimental analysis the carrier surface specific and biomass specific substrate conversion rates indicate the reactor scale maximal treatment capacity and biomass scale biofilm metabolic bioactivity respectively these specific rates for fss oxidation sulfate generation and denitrification were determined through linear regression of the specific fss concentrations fss i where i refers to the sampling time h sulfate so4 i nitrate no3 i mg s l or mg n l versus time h divided by the specific surface area m2 l or the specific attached biomass concentration mg avs l respectively all regression coefficients r2 were greater than 0 9 with p 0 05 the surface specific and biomass specific electron transfer rates mmole e m2 h and mmole e gavs h can be converted from the corresponding fss oxidation rate by multiplying the nominal electron donation factor i e 2 mmol e 32 mg fssoxidized for partial oxidation fss s0 or 8 mmol e 32 mg fssoxidized for complete oxidation fss so4 2 it should be noted that the estimated active attached biomass concentrations of different sob clades were incorporated into the biomass specific substrate conversion rates 2 5 active attached biomass estimation

table 2 this laboratory scale biofilm reactor was initially seeded with activated sludge and fresh carriers for the cultivation of soad moving bed biofilms after consistent mixing for 48 h under anaerobic condition the influent containing nitrate 30 mg n l thiosulfate 24 mg s l and sulfide 48 mg s l was slowly fed into the system with an initial hydraulic retention time of 12 h phase 1a nitrate concentration in the effluent started to decrease by 10 20 mg n l over the first several days and denitrification efficiency increased to 83 8 during the latter period days 10 60 fig 1a next phase 1b days 61 84 the influent flowrate was increased from 20 to 30 l d as a result of decreasing the reactor hrt to 8 h both the nitrate and sulfide removal efficiencies as well as their respective volumetric removal rates were increased to 90 9 and 100 and 0 08 0 01 kg n m3 d and 0 14 0 02 kg s m3 d respectively fig 1a the sulfur balance was further increased to 98 with the molar ratio of e donated e accepted in the range of 1 44 1 52 mmol e donated mmole e accepted fig 1c the system was next moved to phase 2 with the hrt decreased to 4 h it is impressive that this resulted in a doubling in the denitrification capacity of the biofilms and a volumetric nitrogen loading rate increase from 0 09 to 0 18 kg n m3 d without any lag phase in addition nearly all sulfide and thiosulfate species were oxidized to sulfate as demonstrated by the sulfur balance being approximately 101 at this time the ratio of e donated e accepted was maintained at about 1 49 mmol e donated mmole e accepted confirming that system performance and operation remained stable notably the reactor was successfully operated over one year initially phases 1 and 2 it was fed with mixed sulfur compounds i e sulfide and thiosulfate while in the latter stages phase 3 and 4 thiosulfate in the supplied synthetic wastewater was replaced by dissolved sulfide to mimic the microbial niche of only sulfide containing sewage in phase 3 the hrt was decreased to 4 h sulfide oxidation capacity of the biofilms was further increased to 0 36 0 05 kg s m3 d and nitrate reduction was maintained at a similar reaction rate 0 17 0 02 kg n m3 d to that of phase 2 in phase 4 the reactor hrt was further decreased to 2 h corresponding to greater nitrogen and sulfide loading rates of 0 36 kg n m3 d and 0 72 kg s m3 d the nitrogen removal efficiency was further elevated to 98 2 and the sulfur balance ratio was found at approximately 97 the high efficiencies on sulfide and thiosulfate utilization during the operation indicate the complete conversion of all the reduced sulfur compounds i e thiosulfate and sulfide from influent into sulfate in the sob biofilm system the electron balance shows that the molar ratio of e donated e accepted remained in the range of 1 45 1 47 the released electrons from the reduced sulfur compounds were assigned for either dissimilatory denitrification or assimilatory biomass synthesis as a result the amount of electron donated was always higher than the amount of electron accepted with the difference being the portion for biomass synthesis the results proved the continuous stable operation of this lab scale mbbr through a further 300 d for mainstream denitrification driven by sulfide electrons codsulfide this short hrt 2 h is comparable with that used in a conventional heterotrophic denitrification unit ekama and wentzel 2008b and has been demonstrated in this study to enable higher denitrification capacity this is especially notable when compared with other soad processes for municipal wastewater and or surface water treatment table 3 as these all achieved lower nitrogen removal rates 0 03 0 31 kg n m3 d than those achieved in our previous study despite using longer hrts 3 4 40 h 3 2 development of moving bed biofilms the development of the moving bed biofilms over a 700 d operational period is depicted in fig 1d the corresponding specific activities of biofilms were determined in ex situ batch experiments and the results are shown in fig 2 the attached biomass stayed in continuous growth of 0 33 0 05 g avs l at day 10 phase 1a to 0 83 0 12 g avs l at day 84 the end of phase 1b illustrating the rapid growth of sob biomass and indicating that the biofilms colonized the surface of moving bed carriers the amount of suspended solids in the bulk liquid of the mbbr was much lower 22 5 mg vss l compared to the amount of attached biomass as a result of the hrt being reduced to 4 h in phase 2 the attached biomass concentration was increased to 1 32 0 09 g avs l after changing the types of reduced sulfur compounds that were supplied the biofilm concentrations were maintained at about 1 32 0 02 and 2 08 0 14 g avs l in phase 3 and 4 respectively the calculated sludge yield coefficient of the moving bed biofilms varied from 0 44 g vs g n at phase 1a to 0 58 g vs g n at phase 4 which is close to the range reported previously 0 15 0 57 g vs g n manconi et al 2007 yang et al 2016 the mbbr can efficiently accelerate the immobilization of functional sob communities and protect the slow growth autotrophs from being washed out this unique feature meets the stability of soad process in mainstream nitrogen removal and supports the mbbr as an appealing option compared to some other soad biosystems which may demonastrate relative restricted denitrification rate e g s0 driven packed bed bioreactor or may lead to unexpected biomass loss during operation e g suspended sludge system the biofilm thickness was rapidly increased to 92 1 μm at the end of phase 1 and it was observed in the range between 118 and 128 μm during phase 2 and 3 and 153 19 μm in phase 4 always lower than the critical value of 200 μm for biofilm mass transfer limitation cui et al 2018 hence there will not be much of negative impact on the mass transfer and reactor performance as eventhough the nlr was doubled in phase 4 the effluent qualities have not deteriorated it is also interesting to find that the volumetric nlr could be linearly correlated with biofilm attached biomass concentrations as shown in fig s2 and table s1 this result implies that nlr is one of the key factors affecting biofilm growth and this work shows that the hydrodynamic and substrate loading conditions concurrently regulate the formation of the moving bed biofilms and effective reactive regime the biofilm gradually developed into a compact and effective ecological bacterial matrix enabling sulfide driven autotrophic mainstream denitrification the specific biofilm activities of autotrophic denitrification which were determined through batch tests were found to be 18 35 mg n m2 h at phase 1a and 76 15 mg n m2 h at phase 2 afterwards the surface specific nitrogen loading rates were 25 and 50 mg n m2 h at phase 3 and 4 fig 2a corresponding to the surface specific denitrification rates of 63 83 and 147 77 mg n m2 h respectively the lower rate in phase 3 compared to phase 2 was plausibly caused by the increase of the sulfide concentration by 25 table 2 the surface specific sulfate production rates increased significantly from 5 94 mg s m2 h at phase 1a to 145 mg s m2 h at phase 4 but sulfate generation was constantly lower than sulfide oxidation in the batch tests due to the bioaccumulation of elemental sulfur s0 and its relative lower oxidation rate compared to sulfide oxidation our previous study cui et al 2019b suggested two clades of sobs sox independent sob sobi and sox dependent sob sobii performing indirect two step sulfide oxidation s2 s0 so4 2 with potentially producing intermediate s0 and direct sulfide oxidation s2 so4 2 respectively more information about the two sob clades will be provided in the following sections 3 3 microbial community dynamics and diversity in soad moving bed biofilms 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to determine the relative abundance and diversity of the bacterial population among the seeding activated sludge ad 0 and the four biosamples ad 1 to ad 4 taken from the bioreactor the parameters of the similarity based otus and species richness and diversity estimates of microbial communities were determined table s3 as shown in fig 3 a visualized by using circos krzywinski et al 2009 the dynamic changes of all biosamples regarding microbial community structure at class level were presented as documented in literatures all sob are documented under proteobacterial classes as reviewed by shao et al 2010 the sobi clade which follows the sox independent sulfide oxidation pathway consists of β and γ proteobacteria sob shao et al 2010 in present study the proportions of both β and γ proteobacteria continuously increased from 2 38 to 11 95 in seeding sludge ad 0 to 21 29 and 30 40 in ad 2 biofilm sample phase 2 respectively and persisted in similar proportions 19 66 26 91 in the rest operation the sobii clade which follows sox sulfide oxidation pathway consists α and ε proteobacteria sob ghosh and dam 2009 shao et al 2010 compared to the seeding sludge the proportion of α proteobacteria increased by 1 5 times to 21 27 in ad 1 phase 1 and remained at 19 93 in ad 2 biosample this value interestingly further increased to 26 31 in ad 3 phase 3 but eventually declined by nearly half 13 98 in ad 4 phase 4 the ε proteobacteria presented a similar trend to that of α proteobacteria among the communities of ad 2 0 36 ad 3 11 22 and ad 4 6 91 the δ proteobacteria mainly comprising sulfate reducing bacteria srb persisted at a proportion of 12 1 16 8 during most of the long term operation except during sulfide inhibition depression in phase 3 when the δ proteobacteria proportion rapidly decreased to approximately 5 the enrichment of srb indicates that they can also play an important role in the development and evolution of sob biofilms guo et al 2016 the organics utilized for srb are plausibly from the cell endogenous decay in the biofilms flavobacteria and ignavibacteria were also detected with the relative abundances of 6 56 11 and 0 26 7 in the biofilm samples respectively they have been observed with noticeable amount 1 in other soad granular and suspended sludge systems yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 however their functions in soad process still need further investigation fig 3b illustrates the phylogenetic taxa at the genus level with a relative abundance greater than 1 genus paracoccus has been frequently reported in the denitrification biosystems driven by diverse electron donors e g organic carbons reduced sulfur compounds and h2 friedrich et al 2005 its representative species paracoccus denitrificans and p pantotropha were confirmed to mediate the sox pathway for sulfide oxidation kelly et al 1997 sauvé et al 2007 in the present study this genus gradually grew to comprise a significant proportion of the biofilms from 0 37 in ad 0 to 12 44 in ad 3 before decreasing to a proportion of 2 33 when encountering higher sulfide flux at phase 4 the enrichment of otu 26 and otu 12 fig 3c which are highly likely to be assignable to p denitrificans and p pantotropha confirmed the dynamic change of paracoccus levels of genus maribius from the same family rhodobacteraceae of paracoccus were also slowly enriched from 0 02 at the beginning to 7 87 at ad 4 proportions of otu 11 and the phylogenetic related otu 7136 which may belong to genus maribius also increased fig 3c the influent has been volumetrically synthesized using 20 seawater which could facilitate enrichment of some marine sulfur oxidizing bacteria e g maribius salinus in this moving bed biofilm system however the reasons for this dominance of maribius require further investigation genus sulfurimonas began to become dominant at ad 3 11 12 compared to ad 2 0 35 however it declined to 6 82 at ad 4 sulfurimonas denitrificans which could be assigned to one of the detected subunits otu 124 otu 30 and otu 89 fig 3c has been recognized to possess sox pathway for sulfide oxidation sievert et al 2008 the genera paracoccus and sulfurimonas had similar trends in dynamics of relative abundances to other members of the sobii clade fig 3c thus making them members of this clade the genera sedimenticola and thiolapillus are marine sob that were originally isolated from hydrothermal ecosystems nunoura et al 2014 flood et al 2015 in our system they increased to represent significant proportions of ad 1 19 64 and 5 67 respectively from initially negligible levels 0 01 0 1 at ad 0 based on the phylogenetic analysis of 50 most abundant otus fig 3c sedimenticola otu 0 and thiolapillus otu 58 and otu 125 exhibited the distinctive capacity to rapidly occupy the carrier surface in this particular environment which is in line with the known behavior of sob in granular sludge systems guo et al 2016 however the proportions of otu 0 and otu 58 and otu 125 slowly decreased 7 14 and 1 18 respectively at ad 4 showing their inability to persist during long term system operation otu 1 and otu 5 are possible species e g thiobacillus denitrificans from genus thiobacillus which are commonly reported as capable of aerobic and anaerobic biological sulfide oxidation lan et al 2019 the proportions of these species increased from 0 05 at ad 1 to 12 01 at ad 2 and the eventually stabilized at 16 62 at ad 4 some species of genera thiohalobacter e g thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus and thioalbus e g thioalbus denitrificans have been isolated from marine sediments and shown the ability to reduce nitrogen by oxidizing sulfur zhu and getting 2012 in our system it was interesting to note that proportions of both genera thiohalobacter otu 16 and otu 1736 and thioalbus otu 18 rapidly increased from trace levels 0 0 61 in initial biofilms ad 1 to significant levels 6 68 7 48 in mature biofilms ad 4 mirroring the dynamic changes also demonstrated by thiobacillus some genera of the sobi clade e g sedimenticola and thiolapillus were observed to rapidly colonize the carrier surface during the start up phase but then decreased in the follow up phases at which point other genera of sobi e g thiobacillus thiohalobacter and thioalbus would arise and multiply over the long term operation of the system fig 3b more diverse sob were observed in this study is possible due to the addition of 20 of real seawater 3 4 co occurrence of sobi and sobii the active sobi and sobii biomass concentration in the biofilm could be calculated by using a simplified steady state model equation as shown in si based on these predicted values the corresponded sobi and sobii bacterial relative abundances were also calculated the results are shown in fig 4 a both sobi and sobii were successfully cultivated from seeding sludge and grown on the moving beds at phase 1 ad 1 with the attached biomass concentrations i e active sob biomass of 76 mg sobi l and 47 mg sobii l respectively the attached sobi biomass concentration gradually increased to over 400 mg sobi l at phase 2 ad 2 and declining by 11 354 mg sobi l at phase 3 ad 3 which is in line with the dynamics of sobi fractions during phase 4 the attached sobi biomass concentration was nearly doubled to 652 mg sobi l compared to that of phase 3 possibly due to increased substrate loads rather than sobi bacterial enrichment table 1 thus it can be seen that an effective sobi active biomass is able to accumulate during long term operation and a stable relative abundance of sobi is maintained the sobii biomass was observed to constantly increase from ad 1 to ad 3 but was always present in lower concentrations relative to sobi the significant build up of sobii biomass from 157 mg sobii l at ad 2 to 298 mg sobii l at ad 3 indicates that a sulfide stimulation 25 increase in sulfide concentration at this point could assist in biomass growth fig 4a these data are in agreement with the observed trend of sobii relative abundance although the relative fraction of sobii among all the microbial community has been depressed by nearly half to 20 89 due to the intense competition with other sob for spatial and energy demanding advantages at phase 4 the sobii biomass concentration was interestingly maintained at 296 4 mg sobii l throughout phase 3 and 4 these findings demonstrate the divergent trends between the bacterial cell growth and microbial community evolution of each sob clade during long term mbbr operation to further explain microbial competition and to yield more insight into their evolutionary impact on soad process the specific bioactivities of the two communities for sulfide utilization and electron transfer capacity were evaluated in a manner akin to that reported in the literature visser et al 1997 the competition between sobi and sobii over fss free and saline sulfide utilization and electron transfer capacity at reactor scale was compared by means of evaluating their carrier surface specific rates fig 4b and c as mentioned above the sulfate generation rate and the difference between the overall fss utilization rate and the sulfate generation rate from the bioactivity tests were used to indicate the sobii and sobi fss utilization rates respectively fig 4b shows that sobii exhibited a far lower surface specific fss utilization rate than that of sobi as the fss utilization rate of sobii amounted to only 4 28 of that of sobi even though the sobii rate continuously increased by 24 4 times from phase 1 to 4 however sobii displayed superior electron transfer capacity in this biofilm system as shown in fig 4c the sobii surface specific electron transfer rate increased from 1 49 to 36 25 mmol e m2 h and even contributed greater capacity than sobi at phase 4 from the perspective of reactor performance sulfide was mainly consumed by sobi 78 96 during all phases but sobii exhibited increasing and ultimately greater ability than sobi for oxidative electron transfer from sulfide consumption over long term operation of the system as illustrated in fig 4d and e the competition between sobi and sobii over fss utilization and electron transfer capacity at biomass scale was compared by means of analyzing their corresponding biomass specific rates interestingly we discovered that the sobi biomass specific fss utilization rate decreased continuously from phase 1 to phase 4 from 599 to 242 mg s g sobi h conversely the corresponding sobii biomass specific fss utilization rate increased continuously except for a temporary decline at phase 3 which was possibly caused by sulfide inhibition the analysis of biomass specific electron transfer further illustrated the difference in their activity profiles with sobii exhibited an almost 2 5 times greater electron transfer per gram of sob than sobi at phase 4 fig 4e this finding indicates the activity of sobii rather than that of sobi could be enhanced during soad over long term stable operation which suggest further avenues for the improvement of biomass treatment capacity 3 5 metabolism functional prediction to gain insight into the molecular functions of bacteria across all five biosamples phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was applied to predict changes to nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms by imputing the available annotated genes within the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg catalogue as visualized by using circos in fig 5 a and b the functional genes related to the nitrogen microtransformations of denitrification dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonia dnra assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia nitrogen fixation and nitrification were all selected to visualize the bacterial community evolutions at the molecular level pauleta et al 2013 as shown in fig 5a the predicted proportions of the four related denitrification enzymes dissimilatory nitrate no3 reductase nitrite no2 reductase nitric oxide no reductase and nitrous oxide n2o reductase were presented between all the five biosamples the no3 reductases which are represented by ec 1 7 5 1 k00370 narg k00371 narh and k00374 nari and ec 1 7 99 4 k02567 napa and k02568 napb was shown in ad 1 with a level of 10 85 and was increased to a maximal level of 13 53 in ad 2 and then stabilized at approximately 9 61 11 73 in ad 3 and 4 the no reductases represented by ec 1 7 2 5 k04561 norb and k02305 norc showed a similar changing profile with dissimilatory nitrate reductases though they were most abundant in ad 3 8 27 rather than ad 0 1 70 in contrast the proportions of both no2 reductases and n2o reductases which were represented by ec 1 7 2 1 k00368 nirk and ec 1 7 2 4 k00376 nosz respectively did not significantly alter until ad 3 when greater abundances 2 83 and 3 10 respectively were observed the overall reactor performance and kinetic experiments demonstrate the increasing denitrification capacity of the soad moving bed biofilms during operation however the corresponding enzymatic activities may not be enhanced as the predicted relevant denitrification genes were not found constantly to display increasing abundances the nitrate loads may lead to the prevalence of no3 and no reductases whilst higher sulfide concentration in phase 3 may stimulate no2 no and n2o reductases and inhibit no3 reductases in this situation the net result over long term stable operation ad 4 would be a reduction in the activity of all reductases this may result from physiological alteration e g endogenous respiration extracellular polymeric substance secretion conthe et al 2019 and the evolution of phylogenetic distribution e g growth of srb fig 3b predicted changes in functional genes associated with sulfur conversion are further illustrated in fig 5b including assimilatory sulfate reduction dissimilatory sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation the kegg database currently lack of annotated sequences for sox and sulfide quinone reductase sqr enzymatic systems the prediction for sulfur oxidizing enzymes can only proceed over dissimilatory sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation reversible bioreactions can be mediated by sulfur involving enzymes shared by both dissimilatory sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation pott and dahl 1998 in the biological sulfide oxidation sulfide is converted into sulfite and further into sulfate via adenosylphosphosulfate aps with the aid of dissimilatory sulfate reductases dsr ec 1 8 99 5 adenylylsulfate reductase apr ec 1 8 99 2 and sulfate adenylyltransferase sat ec 2 7 7 4 in this study both subunits of dsr k11180 dsra and k11181 dsrb were more abundant in mature biofilms ad 2 to ad 4 with proportions of 4 25 5 54 which are nearly two times greater than those in the seeding sludge ad 0 and the biofilm at start up phase ad 1 fig 5b overall the results of functional prediction show that the changes of subcategories under metabolism including energy metabolism carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism between all biosamples were not statistically significant p 0 05 but the results indicate the metabolic divergence between sulfur and nitrogen metabolisms as compared to seeding sludge the predicted sulfide oxidation enzymes in biofilm samples were increased but denitrification enzymes were maintained at similar values this implies the potential overcapacity of functional sulfur oxidizing enzymes conthe et al 2019 which allows for greater influent sulfide loading rate hence an even shorter hrt i e 1 h may also be feasible which would be worthwhile verifying in future studies 4 conclusions this study revealed several aspects underpinning the shift in structure and function of microbial communities performing sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrification in a mbbr with the results allowing the following conclusions to be drawn the long term stability of the mbbr system was verified with over 700 d continuous stable operation with over 98 of nitrate reduction and 100 of dissolved sulfide conversion achieved resulting in nitrate and sulfide removal rates of 0 37 kg n m3 d and 0 73 kg s m3 d respectively under low hrt 2 h operational condition the s n ratio is about 2 0 gs gn which is close to the experimental value of 1 9 gs gn for complete sulfide oxidation resulting in no accumulation of elemental sulfur s0 in biofilms the maximal biofilm activities for sulfide partial oxidation and denitrification determined in batch experiments were 667 mg s m2 h and 148 mg n m2 h respectively which were reached with over 2 1 g l of attached volatile solids of the biofilm system and reactor hrt at 2 h moreover the nitrogen loading rates could linearly enhanced the biofilm attached biomass concentrations sob communities were detected in diverse taxa some sobi genera e g sedimenticola and thiolapillus rapidly colonized the carrier surface at start up while other sobi genera e g thiobacillus thiohalobacter and thioalbus began to thrive in the later stages of the process the increase in sobii genera e g paracoccus and sulfurimonas was stimulated by sulfide but could be depressed over long term operation moreover the sobii biomass specific electron transfer capacity was eventually almost 2 5 times greater than that of sobi 38 mmol e gsobii d v s 15 mmol e gsobi d indicating sobii is selected under stress conditions such as a shorter hrt further studies on the methods and mechanism of selecting of sobii over sobi in biofilm reactors are recommended picrust was employed to analyze the sulfide oxidizing biofilms performing mainstream denitrification to predict microbial functions and the sulfur and nitrogen metabolic pathways based on the information in the kegg database the specific functions associated with sobi and sobii should be investigated by metagenomic

18461,multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts peroxydisulfate pds is a green oxidative system for abatement of aqueous organic pollutants while the powder form and poor cycling performance of the catalyst limit its practical application to solve these problems fabricating a mwcnt cathode negative polarization to coupling carbocatalysis driven pds activation with electrosorption of organic pollutant was previously demonstrated to be a possible solution to these problems to further improve the activation efficiency of pds positive polarization of mwcnt electrode anode was adapted to activate pds for removing acyclovir and phenol in this work under a working voltage of 1 2 v the mwcnt anode was more efficient than the mwcnt cathode and the non polarized mwcnt electrode for pds activation and removal of organic pollutants owing to the enhanced attraction between s2o8 2 anions and anode although the positive negative polarization of mwcnt electrode doesn t alter the nonradical mechanism involved in mwcnts pds system theoretical calculations suggest that different polarization affect the electron configuration and oxidative capacity of activated s2o8 2 bounded to mwcnts differently and that the adsorbed s2o8 2 with stretched s o bond and much higher oxidative capacity than that in the case of non polarized mwcnt electrode is responsible for the mwcnts anode while adsorbed s2o8 2 with stretched o o bond and slightly higher oxidative capacity is responsible for the mwcnts cathode finally implications of operation parameters including electrode potential energy cost ph etc on the elimination efficiency by mwcnt anode pds system were investigated and the results suggest that the mwcnt anode pds is an efficient and economical metal free electrochemical oxidative system for organic contaminants remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords peroxydisulfate organic pollutants carbocatalysis carbon nanotube electrode positive polarization 1 introduction the advanced oxidation processes aops which are well known powerful techniques for abatement of organic pollutants have been universally applied in industry miklos et al 2018 in aops highly reactive oxygen species ros are exploited to completely mineralize organic contaminants or transform the bio recalcitrant organic compounds into biodegradable products prior to the bioprocessing chen et al 2017 duan et al 2018c peroxydisulfate pds as a green oxidant has been widely applied for aops in the last two decades because the activation of pds can generate reactive sulfate radicals so4 which possess higher redox potential and longer lifetime than hydroxyl radicals oh chen et al 2018 duan et al 2018c traditionally metal and metal oxides have been commonly employed to activate pds due to the easy operation and high efficiency anipsitakis et al 2006 2005 unfortunately leaching of metal ions may happen when metallic activators are used which may result in secondary pollution anipsitakis et al 2005 to address this issue developing metal free catalysts is of great importance carbonaceous materials including activated carbons carbon nanotubes cnts reduced graphene oxide mesoporous carbon nanodiamonds carbon aerogels and so on have been recently reported to show good catalytic activity towards pds activation chen et al 2018 duan et al 2018a 2018c 2016 2015 however most carbocatalysts are in the form of powder which requires a post treatment like filtration or high speed centrifugation to separate and recycle the catalysts the involvement of such post treatment hinders the practical application of these promising carbocatalysts in abatement of organic pollutants to overcome this disadvantage integrating the powdery catalysts with binders to fabricate electrodes can be a potential solution the carbonaceous electrodes can be immersed into the solution or assembled into units to activate pds to remove organic pollutants making the separation and recycling of carbocatalysts convenient capacitive deionization cdi which is also known as electrosorption has been proposed as an energy saving electrochemical method for removing inorganic ions and organic compounds with respect to electrolysis porada et al 2013 tang et al 2019 due to the suitable porous structures and electrical conductivity carbonaceous materials are commonly utilized as cdi electrode materials li et al 2009 2018 liu et al 2015 xu et al 2016 in electrosorption process the applying of direct current voltage below the breakdown voltage of water 1 23 v onto the porous electrodes can induce the quick accumulation of ions or charged organic groups in aqueous solution onto the surface of polarized electrodes forming the so called electric double layer our previous work nie et al 2018 showed that enhanced removal of aniline could be achieved by using a negatively polarized multi walled cnt mwcnt electrode cathode due to the synergistic effect between electrosorption of organics and activation of pds in addition the mwcnt cathode exhibited much better stability than the mwcnts catalysts for aniline removal suggesting that the continuous supply of negative charges which serve as persulfate activator may reduce the consumption of active sites in carbocatalysts remarkably such an approach required much lower energy cost compared to the electrolytic activation of pds process at platinum pt cathode regarding the aniline mineralization thereby utilization of polarized mwcnt electrode to activate pds is indicated to be a potential economical and efficient technique for abatement of aqueous organic contaminants to promote the practical application of this technique attempts to further improve the pds activation efficiency are necessary additionally the mechanism of pds activation at mwcnt cathode was not well understood in our previous work e g the detailed electronic structure of the nonradical ros generated by pds activation which is worthy of further investigation it has been reported that the electro activation of pds can be realized by both cathodic activation and anodic activation while the efficiency and induced ros in the two cases are different chen et al 2014 chen and huang 2015 matzek et al 2018 song et al 2017 for instance chen et al unveiled the pds reduction at cathodic platinum pt electrode to generate so4 via one electron transfer reaction chen et al 2014 chen and huang 2015 ma and co workers recently reported that the anodic activation of pds at pt electrode is more efficient than the cathodic activation and nonradical oxidation is responsible for the anodic activation song et al 2017 consequently we speculate that higher activation efficiency of pds and different activation mechanism may also be induced by positive polarization of mwnct electrode anode compared to the mwcnt cathode however relevant studies are scarcely present in the literature herein removal of acyclovir which is a typical antivirus agent and hazardous phenol by mwcnt anode or mwcnt cathode in a flow between asymmetric quasi cdi aqcdi unit cell were compared the stability of mwcnt anode for pds activation and removal of acyclovir was also studied in addition the influence of positive charges and negative charges at the surface of mwcnt electrode on the activation of pds were systematically investigated and the involved activation mechanisms were unveiled by conducting control experiments using an aqcdi unit cell incorporated with ion exchange membrane electrochemical analyses and theoretical calculations finally the corresponding energy consumption influences of ph values voltages pds concentration and background matters such as chloride ions carbonate ions on the degradation efficiency of acyclovir were evaluated to assess the potential application of activated pds by mwcnt anode using an aqcdi unit cell for abatements of organic contaminants in wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials details on the mwcnts chemicals and preparation of solutions use in this work can be found in text s1 2 2 assembling of aqcdi unit cell a casting method as reported in the literature was employed to fabricate mwcnt electrodes park and choi 2010 details are described in text s2 an aqcdi cell with similar configuration to those used in other studies li et al 2009 2018 was assembled fig s1 and the details can be found in our previous work nie et al 2018 for control experiments an anion exchange membrane aem or cation exchange membrane cem with the same dimension as mwcnt electrode was placed in front of the mwcnt electrode fig s1 and the assembled unit was named as aqcdi aem or aqcdi cem 2 3 removal of organic pollutants batch experiments were performed in a continuously recycling system nie et al 2018 and ph of the solution of organic pollutant was not buffered unless specified more details are provided in text s3 2 4 analytical methods a hplc equipped with a uv detector elite eclassical3100 was used to measure the concentration of all organic pollutants methanol and ultrapure water were employed as mobile phases at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 total organic carbon toc was measured with a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu ki method was used to measure the concentration of pds liang et al 2008 linear sweep voltammetry lsv were performed on a chi 660e electrochemical workstation ch instruments ins shanghai with a three electrode cell see text s4 for details electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker emxplus 10 12 spectra were recorded to analyze the generated active radicals the solution ph was measured by a ph meter leici shanghai 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of organic pollutants abatement among various systems acyclovir and phenol were selected as the target organic pollutants to evaluate the degradation performance of polarized mwcnt electrode catalyzed pds activation with the aqcdi cell in the case of acyclovir removal fig 1 a adsorption desorption equilibrium of the organics onto mwcnt electrode was reached in 90 min and mwcnt electrode itself could adsorb a certain amount of acyclovir due to the large specific surface area ssa 442 m2 g 1 of mwcnts nie et al 2018 after adding pds into the acyclovir solution the concentration of organic compound was further decreased without the applying of voltage on the aqcdi unit cell aqcdi pds 0v ascribing to the reason that the s2o8 2 ions flowing through the surface of mwcnt electrode could be effectively activated to generate ros for oxidizing acyclovir guan et al 2017 a control experiment with acyclovir oxidation by pds alone indicated that pds itself could hardly oxidize acyclovir once a constant voltage of 1 2 v was imposed on the aqcdi unit cell connecting mwcnt electrode to the positive pole or negative pole of the power was referred as aqcdi pds 1 2v or aqcdi pds 1 2v respectively quicker degradation of acyclovir was achieved with respect to the aqcdi pds 0v system suggesting that the polarization of mwcnts catalysts accelerated the abatement of organic pollutant remarkably to explain such enhanced performance electrosorption of acyclovir by the aqcdi unit cell and degradation of acyclovir with a qcdi unit cell composed of two graphite sheets electrodes g qcdi were studied it was observed that a significant amount of acyclovir was removed upon positive polarization aqcdi 1 2v or negative polarization aqcdi 1 2v of mwcnt electrode attributable to the reason that the dipole moment of the organic compound is increased due to the changes of surface charge density on the c surface upon positive or negative polarization and thus enhances the π π interaction between the aromatic rings of organic compound and the surface of mwcnt electrodes bayram and ayranci 2010 notably higher removal efficiency of acyclovir was achieved by aqcdi 1 2v 67 than aqcdi 1 2v 46 which possibly because a small amount of cationic acyclovir may be present in the solution resulting from the partially dissociation of electron accepting groups in acyclovir molecule under the electric field and the cationic acyclovir was attracted onto the surface of mwcnt cathode however graphite paper could barely adsorb the organic compound and only 10 acyclovir was degraded in 180 min by pds activation with the g qcdi unit cell under a voltage of 1 2 v as known graphite paper shows low ssa and poor catalytic activity towards pds activation lee et al 2015 by replacing one graphite paper electrode with mwcnt electrode in the g qcdi unit cell the higher catalytic activity and electrosorption capacity of mwcnts endowed by the larger ssa and unique nanostructures can improve both the pds activation efficiency and the adsorption of acyclovir resulting in elevated degradation performance in addition the close interaction between the electrochemically adsorbed organic molecules and surface reactive species generated from pds activation at the electrode facilitates the electron transport between them and promotes the oxidation of pollutants in the case of phenol removal fig 1b the adsorption desorption equilibrium onto mwcnt electrode was reached in 50 min and around 12 phenol was removed by adsorption similarly g qcdi pds 1 2v showed poor degradation performance while both aqcdi pds 1 2v 97 and aqcdi pds 1 2v 58 systems exhibited higher removal efficiency than aqcdi pds 0v 55 verifying that the synergistic effect between the electrosorption of organic compound onto mwcnt electrode which was demonstrated in the control experiments and carbocatalysis driven pds activation could enhance the abatement of organic pollutants unlike acyclovir higher removal efficiency of phenol was achieved by aqcdi 1 2v 61 than aqcdi 1 2v 30 possibly because phenol molecules contain electron donating groups which are preferentially attracted onto mwcnt anode another point to note that the aqcdi pds 1 2v system outperformed the aqcdi pds 1 2v system in both acyclovir and phenol removal the improved performance of aqcdi pds 1 2v system for phenol removal can be related to the higher electrosorption efficiency of mwcnt anode than mwcnt cathode however decreased electrosorptive removal of acyclovir was achieved with mwcnt anode compared to mwcnt cathode this phenomena unveiled that the polarization of mwcnt electrode may exert influence on the pds activation and mwcnt anode was more efficient than the mwcnt cathode for pds activation consistent with the previous work song et al 2017 moreover the variations of pds concentration in aqcdi pds 1 2v system and aqcdi pds 1 2v system fig s2 confirmed that more pds were decomposed on the mwcnt anode it is worth mentioning that although aqcdi pds 1 2v system only showed a little higher phenol removal efficiency than aqcdi pds 0v system in which fresh mwcnts were used the performance of the former remained stable while the latter declined gradually in three consecutive tests fig 1c these results disclosed that the active sites present in mwcnts predominantly reacted with pds during the activation process while the charges on the surface of mwcnt cathode could assist the pds activation when the active sites were gradually consumed in recycling tests it has been proposed that the during the process of anodic activation of pds at pt anode s2o8 2 ions firstly migrate to the anode by the coulombic force and then the electron configuration of the ions are rearranged under the influence of surface positive charges of anode resulting in the formation of a transition state of pds molecule bounded on the pt anode which serves as the primary nonradical reactive species responsible for organic pollutants degradation song et al 2018 to understand if the electrostatic attraction could also enhance the pds activation at polarized mwcnt electrode ion exchange membranes are introduced into the aqcdi unit cell and the acyclovir degradation behaviors of the resultant unit cells were evaluated fig 1d shows that the aqcdi cem pds 1 2v system only gave a total removal efficiency of 29 while the adsorption of organic pollutant onto mwcnt electrode accounted for 20 revealing the low effectiveness for pds activation compared to aqcdi cem pds 1 2v system aqcdi aem pds 1 2v system gave a higher total removal efficiency of 49 which should arise from the reason that the cation selectivity of cem inhibited the electrosorption of s2o8 2 ions onto the surface of mwcnt anode and thus suppressed the pds activation the above results demonstrated that the electrostatic attraction between pds and mwcnt anode play an important role during the process of pds activation at mwcnt anode for comparison acyclovir degradation by aqcdi aem pds 0v system and electrosorptive removal of acyclovir by acdi aem 1 2v system were also tested as seen aqcdi aem pds 0v system achieved a much lower removal efficiency 23 than aqcdi pds 0v system which is likely because that the ion exchange membrane in front of mwcnt electrode was fouled by the organic substances tanaka et al 2012 and thus hindered the permeation of pds in the flowing solution onto the surface of mwcnt electrode abating the carbocatalysis additionally the lower electrosorptive removal of acyclovir by aqcdi aem 1 2v system 26 than aqcdi 1 2v system 46 suggested that the presence of ion exchange membrane also hinders the electrosorption of organic compound onto mwcnt electrode due to the fouling effect as a consequence of the inhibitory effect of aem on acyclovir electrosorption and catalysis driven pds activation decreased performance of aqcdi aem pds 1 2v system than aqcdi pds 1 2v system was obtained 3 2 quenching experiments methanol is popularly used as radical scavenger for both so4 and ho k s o 4 2 5 10 7 m 1 s 1 k h o 9 7 10 8 m 1 s 1 according to the reference buxton et al 1988 and singlet oxygen 1o2 can be scavenged by nan3 k o 1 2 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 or furfuryl alcohol ffa k o 1 2 1 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 chen et al 2018 to discern the primary reactive species during mwcnts powders catalyzed pds activation and polarized mwcnts catalyzed pds activation the scavengers were separately added into the aqueous solution using acyclovir as the model compound ffa nan3 was used here because 1o2 has been recently reported as the primary ros in pds activation by cnts and biochar cheng et al 2017 yin et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 fig 2 a and b shows that the presence of methanol and ffa nan3 barely inhibited the degradation of acyclovir suggesting that both mwcnts pds and aqcdi pds 1 2v oxidative systems are not relied on either free radicals or 1o2 during the pds activation process epr measurements further supported that neither free radicals nor 1o2 was involved in the mwcnts pds system fig s3 hence surface bounded activated pds in a metastable state is proposed to dominate the oxidation in the above two systems via a nonradical manner to attack the organic substance by electron abstraction in accordance with the reported works guan et al 2017 song et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 quenching experiments with aqcdi pds 1 2v system fig 2c revealed that nonradical oxidation pathway was also responsible for the activation of pds at the mwcnt cathode quite differing from the commonly reported sulfate radicals dominated cathodic activation of pds process which was stimulated by electrolysis at high working voltages chen et al 2014 chen and huang 2015 it would be interesting to investigate if the increase of voltage could lead to the generation of free radicals from pds activation at mwcnt cathode first a voltage of 2 v was applied to the mwcnt electrode and degradation efficiency of acyclovir was measured then quenching experiment with 1 m methanol under the same voltage was conducted after that we repeated the two experiments on the same electrode as shown in fig 2d although acyclovir degradation in the two quenching experiments was partially inhibited compared with two control experiments without methanol the performance of aqcdi pds 2v system gradually decreased after the first two cycles hence the increase of working voltage for cathodic activation may not induce a radical system but resulted in decay of performances this could possibly be attributed to the faradaic reactions occurred at carbon outer layer which gave rise to partial surface oxidation when a high voltage was applied he et al 2016 3 3 electrochemical analysis to illustrate the involved mechanism for aqcdi pds 1 2v and aqcdi pds 1 2v systems lsv measurement was performed to analyze the electron transfer between the reactants and electrode surface fig 3 a depicts a minor current increase with the addition of acyclovir or pds alone implying the negligible electron transfer between pds or acyclovir and mwcnt electrode however the current increased slightly once the scanning voltage was above 1 05 v when acyclovir and pds were simultaneously present indicating that oxidation of acyclovir occurred on the surface of carbon electrode therefore we speculate that when s2o8 2 ion was adsorbed onto the mwcnt anode it was transformed into an activated state stimulated by the electric charge at the mwcnt electrode without decomposed into sulfate radicals while the activated pds could react with the organic molecules when they were also present in the solution to produce sulfate ions which gave rise to a slight increase of current an identical tendency was present in fig 3b when a negative potential was applied to the mwcnt electrode revealing the same activation mechanism involved at the mwcnt cathode the similar lsv measurements were also observed for ec ti pt anode pds cnt pds and graphitized nanodiamonds pds g nd pds systems lee et al 2016 2015 song et al 2017 ma et al recently proposed that lsv may not be a suitable characterization method for identifying the mechanism of pds activation in cnt pds or g nd pds based nonradical systems as the involved pds activation is a heterogeneous process instead of an electrochemical process song et al 2017 our results in this work demonstrated that the pds could be electrochemically activated by nanocarbon electrode which contributed to the signals in the lsv measurements supporting the ma s perspective 3 4 theoretical investigation on the pds activation by charged mwcnt electrode although the above results indicated that the activation pathway of pds by mwcnts was not altered by the polarization of mwcnts the influence of positive or negative surface charges of mwcnts on the structures and electronic states of the activated pds is unknown to this end density functional theory dft modeling which has been widely employed to elucidate the reactions occurring at the surface of carbonaceous electrodes as well as the intricate interaction between persulfates and carbocatalysts chen et al 2018 duan et al 2018a 2016 was adopted to simulate the possible adsorption configurations of s2o8 2 anion adsorbed onto the surface of polarized cnt electrode under different electrical fields upward positive electric field denotes anode while downward negative electric field denotes cathode as shown in fig 4 details of the modeling are provided in supplementary materials text s5 corresponding adsorption energy the quantity of atonic charge on s2o8 2 anion by hirshfeld analysis q length of o o bond lo o s o bond ls o of the most stable structures for adsorbed s2o8 2 anion were summarized in table 1 note that swcnt was adopted to simplify the model structure because the electronic properties of perfect mwcnts are rather similar to those of perfect swcnts and the number of cnt walls slightly affects the adsorption baughman et al 2002 wang et al 2010 in addition an electric field with different directions was applied to simulate the effect of the polarized electrode in the dft calculations however the intensity in the dft calculations was different from that in experiments the intensity of the electric field f was adopted in the range of 10 3 au 1 au 5 14 1011 v m 1 as most of dft works used in this work ao and peeters 2010 wu et al 2014 and the much higher f in simulation than that in experiment was used to compensate for a short time in dft works xu and chen 2018 herein we focused on the effects of the trend of the f as well as its direction on the adsorption of pds when swcnt was negatively polarized under a negative electric field the calculated eads decreased and the absolute value of q increased gradually with the rise of f compared to neutral swcnt suggesting that the interaction and charge transfer between s2o8 2 anion and swnct was suppressed this should be ascribed to the reason that the coulombic repulsive force between s2o8 2 anion and swnct cathode weakens the interaction between them however the lo o of s2o8 2 anion gradually increased with the electrical field accompanying with the decrease of ls o with respect to the case of neutral swcnt indicating that the surface negative charges on swcnt could induce the further stretch of o o bond but contraction of s o bond in the electron enriched s2o8 2 anion especially when an electrical field of 0 001 au was imposed on swcnt electrode the eads decreased a little while the o o bond was elongated significantly showing that negative polarization of mwcnt with a small electrical field favors the pds activation consistent with our experimental results such activated pds with longer o o bond than that in the case of neutral swcnt may possess stronger oxidizing ability for organic pollutants thus enhancing the degradation performance particularly it was found that the o o bond was cleaved after charging 3e in the structure optimization fig s4 which agrees with the literature reporting the generation of so4 from cathodic activation of pds during electrolysis process chen et al 2014 zeng et al 2016 thereby the experimental evidences and dft calculations illustrated that negative polarization of mwcnt electrode could further stretch the o o bond of surface bounded activated pds and facilitate the electron transfer from mwcnt cathode to s2o8 2 anion which boost the elimination of organic pollutants in the case of swcnt anode the derived eads improved with f and these values were much higher than those obtained in the cases of both neutral swnct and swcnt cathode the higher eads obtained for swcnt anode confirms that the electrostatic attraction between s2o8 2 anion and swcnt anode could improve the interaction between them and thus the activation efficiency of pds in accordance with the experimental results meanwhile the electron transfer between s2o8 2 anion and swcnt anode was increased with f as the q absolute value was reduced gradually we deduced that changing the polarization of cnt from negative to positive induced the reverse of the charge density on cnts which rendered the positively polarized cnt electron deficient see fig s5 and such cnt of electron deficiency could attract the electrons in s2o8 2 anion and may improve the electron transfer between the organic pollutant and surface bounded activated pds via a nonradical pathway surprisingly we discovered that the ls o of s2o8 2 anion was raised remarkably while the lo o was reduced with the electrical field compared to neutral swcnt which opposite to the tendency in the case of swcnt cathode this phenomena implies that negative charges and positive charges on the surface of mwcnt electrode have different influences on the electronic configuration of the activated pds and the interaction between s2o8 2 anion and swcnt anode mainly affected the electron arrangements of s o bond in activated pds furthermore for the purpose of comparing the oxidative capacity of the three kinds of activated s2o8 2 anions the chemical potential μ and global electrophilicity index ω of adsorbed s2o8 2 which are considered as indicators of the oxidative capacity of activated s2o8 2 anions the higher μ and ω mean the higher oxidative capacity under different f were also calculated see text s5 and table s1 for calculation details and listed in table 1 as displayed both the calculated μ and ω of adsorbed s2o8 2 anion in the case of swcnt anode were higher compared to the case of neutral swcnt and these values ascended dramatically with the raised f indicating the remarkable increase of electronegativity of adsorbed s2o8 2 anion when cnt was positively polarized this observation could be ascribed to the reason that the losses of electrons lead to more molecular orbitals in s2o8 2 anion and thus the energy of lumo of s2o8 2 anion adsorbed onto swcnt anode was sharply declined compared to the s2o8 2 anion adsorbed onto neutral swcnt based on the above results it was deduced that the activated s2o8 2 anion with further stretched s o bond bounded to mwcnt anode exhibited much higher oxidative capacity than that bound to neutral mwcnt which could enhance the degradation of organic pollutants by aqcdi pds 1 2v system in the case of swnct cathode the derived μ and ω of adsorbed s2o8 2 anion under different f were also increased relative to the case of neutral swcnt while these values were not as high as those obtained for swcnt anode implying a little higher oxidative capacity of the activated s2o8 2 anion with further stretched o o bond combining the experimental and theoretical results it is demonstrated that both the negative and positive polarization of mwcnt electrode can affect both the electronic state and oxidative capacity of activated pds bounded to the surface of non polarized mwcnts and enhance the pds activation but they exert different influences on activated pds the negative polarization mainly results in the stretch of o o bond and a slight increase of oxidative capacity of activated pds while positive polarization can elongate the s o bond in activated pds and improve its oxidative capacity dramatically in addition compared with negative polarization the positive polarization of mwcnt electrode promotes the adsorption of s2o8 2 anions onto mwcnt anode due to the electrostatic attraction force consequently improving the pds activation efficiency and the removal of organic pollutants possible mechanism of removal of organic pollutants by aqcdi pds 1 2v system was proposed in scheme 1 first s2o8 2 ions and organic molecules are co adsorbed onto the surface of mwcnts by the electrostatic field then the length of s o bond in adsorbed s2o8 2 is stretched by the active sites and s2o8 2 transfers electrons to the surface of mwcnts turning the s2o8 2 into an activated state the activated s2o8 2 s2o8 2 manifests a strong oxidative capacity lee et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 due to the close interaction of activated pds carbon complex and organic molecules on the mwcnt electrode organic molecules can be efficiently oxidized to donate electrons and s2o8 2 is converted to so4 2 and then released to the bulk solution due to the oxidation and mineralization of the adsorbed organic compound organic molecules in the solution can be continuously adsorbed onto the mwcnt electrode and react with s2o8 2 giving rise to an enhanced elimination performance 3 5 stability of aqcdi pds 1 2v system for acyclovir degradation the stability is an important factor for application of pds based oxidative system in practical organic pollutants treatment whereas most carbocatalysts suffer from poor stability the aqcdi pds 1 2v system was tested for 11 cycles and the acyclovir degradation efficiencies are shown in fig 5 it was demonstrated that the degradation efficiency only decreased slightly less than 5 after 11 cycles implying a good reusability of aqcdi pds 1 2v system for catalytic oxidation the aqcdi pds 1 2v system was also tested for 3 cycles and the acyclovir degradation efficiencies are shown in fig s6 clearly the degradation efficiency barely decreased in the 3 cycles compared to the mwcnts pds system the better stability of polarized mwcnts catalyzed pds activation system may be attributed to the reasons that the continuous charges on the surface of mwcnts which serve as persulfate activators reduce the loss of active sites in mwcnts and the polarization of mwcnt electrodes probably prevent the coverage of certain kinds of intermediates on the surface of mwcnts more cycles will be conducted in future studies to evaluate the long term operation of aqcdi pds 1 2v system 3 6 energy consumption of aqcdi pds system for organic pollutants removal to promote the practical application of polarized mwcnt catalyzed pds activation with an aqcdi unit cell for organic pollutants abatement energy consumption is an important economical index to be taken into account in this work the toc removal efficiency and specific energy consumption per unit toc mass removed ectoc text s6 dominguez et al 2018 of different organic pollutants were evaluated for aqcdi pds 1 2v and aqcdi pds 1 2v systems table 2 it can be seen that higher mineralization rate and lower ectoc were achieved by aqcdi pds 1 2v system compared to the electro oxidation process and electro fenton process the derived ectoc is usually more than 0 1 kwh gtoc 1 dominguez et al 2018 sirés et al 2014 the calculated ectoc in this work were much lower demonstrating that polarized mwcnts catalyzed pds activation is an energy efficient approach for wastewater remediation nevertheless both acyclovir and phenol could be almost completely degraded by aqcdi pds 1 2v system a much higher ectoc was achieved for acyclovir removal this is because the intermediates during acyclovir degradation were more persistent and more difficult to be mineralized li et al 2016 as evidenced by the lower toc removal based on the above results it is proposed that our aqcdi pds 1 2v system may serve as an alternative to other electrochemical oxidative systems for abatement of organic pollutants which can be easily mineralized like phenol in real wastewater in terms of energy consumption 3 7 influence of ph on acyclovir degradation by aqcdi pds 1 2v system to explore the adaptable ph ranges of aqcdi pds 1 2v system the oxidation was performed at different initial ph of 2 4 6 8 10 as displayed in fig 6 a the ph values present marginal impact on catalytic degradation suggesting that aqcdi pds 1 2v system can maintain the high oxidative efficiency within a wide ph range 3 8 influence of voltage on acyclovir degradation by aqcdi pds system during the electrosorption process the voltage is a critical factor controlling the electrosorption capacity of peroxide ions and organic compounds the rising voltage can lead to a stronger electrostatic attraction of ions and organics to the electrode giving rise to a faster pds activation and higher degradation efficiency as expected acyclovir degradation was accelerated when the voltage was increased from 0 4 v to 1 2 v fig 6b however further increase of voltage leads to the declined degradation of acyclovir probably due to the occurrence of redox reaction on the mwcnt anode resulting from the water hydrolysis 1 23 v therefore 1 2 v is the optimal voltage for aqcdi pds system in this work 3 9 influence of pds concentration on acyclovir degradation by aqcdi pds 1 2v system different loadings of pds were added into the acyclovir solution in the aqcdi pds 1 2v system as shown in fig 6c clearly the acyclovir degradation was accelerated with the increase of pds concentration during the electro activation the mass transport of pds towards the electrode surface was facilitated at higher pds concentrations which is beneficial to the electro activation process and acyclovir degradation 3 10 influence of presence of inorganic ions on the degradation of acyclovir by aqcdi pds 1 2v system salts and diverse natural organic matters are ubiquitous in the industrial and domestic wastewater it has been reported that chloride ions cl hco3 and co3 2 ions can affect the degradation of organic pollutants in radical based aops because of the non selective nature anipsitakis et al 2006 bennedsen et al 2012 yang et al 2014 however the influence of inorganic ions on the nonradical oxidation from mwcnt anode catalyzed pds activation is still unclear therefore the influence of anions with different valences including cl co3 2 and po4 3 on acyclovir degradation by aqcdi pds 1 2v system was investigated in this work in so4 based aops systems cl can be oxidized into chlorine radicals by so4 the chlorine radicals may enhance or inhibit the degradation of organic pollutants which is dependent on the properties of the target organic compounds yang et al 2014 for nonradical oxidation process several studies have demonstrated that the degradation of organic pollutants could hardly be affected by the presence of cl probably due to the low reactivity of generated ros for cl duan et al 2018b lee et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 in this study fig 7 a manifested that addition of 11 1 mm nacl barely inhibited the acyclovir degradation by aqcdi pds 1 2v system the degradation rate was somehow depressed at the beginning but the acyclovir could still be completely removed within 120 min when 22 2 mm nacl was added probably because the two cl anions competed with one s2o8 2 anions to be electrochemically adsorbed onto the surface of mwcnt anode with the further increase of nacl concentration pds may be partially activated by nacl chen et al 2016 yuan et al 2011 resulting in a slightly improved degradation of acyclovir overall the above results also confirmed that nonradical oxidation pathway plays the dominated role in mwcnt anode catalyzed pds activation carbonate is an important scavenger of free radicals to generate co3 which has a lower reactivity with respect to so4 and ho bennedsen et al 2012 therefore the effect of co3 2 on the degradation of acyclovir was investigated fig 7b shows that the addition of 11 1 mm co3 2 slightly inhibited the degradation of acyclovir which possibly resulted from the competitive electrosorption between co3 2 and s2o8 2 onto the mwcnt electrode both of which are negatively charged with the same valence the rapid decrease of acyclovir concentration at the beginning of the degradation process is probably because that co3 2 may also decompose pds to produce reactive species for acyclovir oxidation jiang et al 2017 the fact that activation efficiency of pds is related to the electrosorption capacity of the s2o8 2 ions was further verified when po4 3 ions were present in the aqcdi pds 1 2v system clearly a significant inhibitory effect on the acyclovir degradation was observed when 11 1 mm po4 3 was added it has been reported that the normalized capacity of activated carbon electrodes for various anions increased with the ionic strength of the anions chen et al 2015 thereby electrosorption of s2o8 2 onto mwcnt anode were suppressed when po4 3 and s2o8 2 ions were both present in the solution giving rise to a declined pds activation and acyclovir degradation 4 conclusions in summary enhanced elimination of organic contaminants in aqueous solution by polarized mwcnts catalyzed pds activation using an aqcdi unit cell than mwcnts pds system was demonstrated compared with mwcnt cathode activation of pds at mwcnt anode attained higher degradation efficiency due to the electrostatic attraction between s2o8 2 anions and anode surface bounded activated pds was revealed to be the primary ros involved in the nonradical oxidation pathway induced from both mwcnts pds and aqcdi pds oxidative systems but the structures electronic states and oxidative capacity of activated pds in these systems were different dft calculations suggested that positive polarization of mwcnt electrode further enlarged the s o bond of surface adsorbed s2o8 2 and improved its oxidative capacity remarkably whereas negative polarization of mwcnt electrode resulted in a larger stretch of o o bond and a little increase of oxidative capacity of the adsorbed activated s2o8 2 in addition aqcdi pds 1 2v system was found to be more stable than the mwcnts pds system for acyclovir degradation the optimized conditions for aqcdi pds system to remove acyclovir was respectively 1 2 v and 11 1 mm pds and the optimized system could be adapted to a wide ph range 2 10 ectoc as the economic factor was calculated for aqcdi pds 1 2v system and a low cost of energy was demonstrated for this system the presence of high concentration of cl could hardly impede the acyclovir degradation while presence of co3 2 or po4 3 inhibited the degradation due to the competitive adsorption between s2o8 2 with co3 2 or po4 3 using positively polarized mwcnt electrode for pds activation may serve as an energy saving and efficient technology for practical remediation of aqueous organic pollutants declaration

18461,multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts peroxydisulfate pds is a green oxidative system for abatement of aqueous organic pollutants while the powder form and poor cycling performance of the catalyst limit its practical application to solve these problems fabricating a mwcnt cathode negative polarization to coupling carbocatalysis driven pds activation with electrosorption of organic pollutant was previously demonstrated to be a possible solution to these problems to further improve the activation efficiency of pds positive polarization of mwcnt electrode anode was adapted to activate pds for removing acyclovir and phenol in this work under a working voltage of 1 2 v the mwcnt anode was more efficient than the mwcnt cathode and the non polarized mwcnt electrode for pds activation and removal of organic pollutants owing to the enhanced attraction between s2o8 2 anions and anode although the positive negative polarization of mwcnt electrode doesn t alter the nonradical mechanism involved in mwcnts pds system theoretical calculations suggest that different polarization affect the electron configuration and oxidative capacity of activated s2o8 2 bounded to mwcnts differently and that the adsorbed s2o8 2 with stretched s o bond and much higher oxidative capacity than that in the case of non polarized mwcnt electrode is responsible for the mwcnts anode while adsorbed s2o8 2 with stretched o o bond and slightly higher oxidative capacity is responsible for the mwcnts cathode finally implications of operation parameters including electrode potential energy cost ph etc on the elimination efficiency by mwcnt anode pds system were investigated and the results suggest that the mwcnt anode pds is an efficient and economical metal free electrochemical oxidative system for organic contaminants remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords peroxydisulfate organic pollutants carbocatalysis carbon nanotube electrode positive polarization 1 introduction the advanced oxidation processes aops which are well known powerful techniques for abatement of organic pollutants have been universally applied in industry miklos et al 2018 in aops highly reactive oxygen species ros are exploited to completely mineralize organic contaminants or transform the bio recalcitrant organic compounds into biodegradable products prior to the bioprocessing chen et al 2017 duan et al 2018c peroxydisulfate pds as a green oxidant has been widely applied for aops in the last two decades because the activation of pds can generate reactive sulfate radicals so4 which possess higher redox potential and longer lifetime than hydroxyl radicals oh chen et al 2018 duan et al 2018c traditionally metal and metal oxides have been commonly employed to activate pds due to the easy operation and high efficiency anipsitakis et al 2006 2005 unfortunately leaching of metal ions may happen when metallic activators are used which may result in secondary pollution anipsitakis et al 2005 to address this issue developing metal free catalysts is of great importance carbonaceous materials including activated carbons carbon nanotubes cnts reduced graphene oxide mesoporous carbon nanodiamonds carbon aerogels and so on have been recently reported to show good catalytic activity towards pds activation chen et al 2018 duan et al 2018a 2018c 2016 2015 however most carbocatalysts are in the form of powder which requires a post treatment like filtration or high speed centrifugation to separate and recycle the catalysts the involvement of such post treatment hinders the practical application of these promising carbocatalysts in abatement of organic pollutants to overcome this disadvantage integrating the powdery catalysts with binders to fabricate electrodes can be a potential solution the carbonaceous electrodes can be immersed into the solution or assembled into units to activate pds to remove organic pollutants making the separation and recycling of carbocatalysts convenient capacitive deionization cdi which is also known as electrosorption has been proposed as an energy saving electrochemical method for removing inorganic ions and organic compounds with respect to electrolysis porada et al 2013 tang et al 2019 due to the suitable porous structures and electrical conductivity carbonaceous materials are commonly utilized as cdi electrode materials li et al 2009 2018 liu et al 2015 xu et al 2016 in electrosorption process the applying of direct current voltage below the breakdown voltage of water 1 23 v onto the porous electrodes can induce the quick accumulation of ions or charged organic groups in aqueous solution onto the surface of polarized electrodes forming the so called electric double layer our previous work nie et al 2018 showed that enhanced removal of aniline could be achieved by using a negatively polarized multi walled cnt mwcnt electrode cathode due to the synergistic effect between electrosorption of organics and activation of pds in addition the mwcnt cathode exhibited much better stability than the mwcnts catalysts for aniline removal suggesting that the continuous supply of negative charges which serve as persulfate activator may reduce the consumption of active sites in carbocatalysts remarkably such an approach required much lower energy cost compared to the electrolytic activation of pds process at platinum pt cathode regarding the aniline mineralization thereby utilization of polarized mwcnt electrode to activate pds is indicated to be a potential economical and efficient technique for abatement of aqueous organic contaminants to promote the practical application of this technique attempts to further improve the pds activation efficiency are necessary additionally the mechanism of pds activation at mwcnt cathode was not well understood in our previous work e g the detailed electronic structure of the nonradical ros generated by pds activation which is worthy of further investigation it has been reported that the electro activation of pds can be realized by both cathodic activation and anodic activation while the efficiency and induced ros in the two cases are different chen et al 2014 chen and huang 2015 matzek et al 2018 song et al 2017 for instance chen et al unveiled the pds reduction at cathodic platinum pt electrode to generate so4 via one electron transfer reaction chen et al 2014 chen and huang 2015 ma and co workers recently reported that the anodic activation of pds at pt electrode is more efficient than the cathodic activation and nonradical oxidation is responsible for the anodic activation song et al 2017 consequently we speculate that higher activation efficiency of pds and different activation mechanism may also be induced by positive polarization of mwnct electrode anode compared to the mwcnt cathode however relevant studies are scarcely present in the literature herein removal of acyclovir which is a typical antivirus agent and hazardous phenol by mwcnt anode or mwcnt cathode in a flow between asymmetric quasi cdi aqcdi unit cell were compared the stability of mwcnt anode for pds activation and removal of acyclovir was also studied in addition the influence of positive charges and negative charges at the surface of mwcnt electrode on the activation of pds were systematically investigated and the involved activation mechanisms were unveiled by conducting control experiments using an aqcdi unit cell incorporated with ion exchange membrane electrochemical analyses and theoretical calculations finally the corresponding energy consumption influences of ph values voltages pds concentration and background matters such as chloride ions carbonate ions on the degradation efficiency of acyclovir were evaluated to assess the potential application of activated pds by mwcnt anode using an aqcdi unit cell for abatements of organic contaminants in wastewaters 2

in the literature was employed to fabricate mwcnt electrodes park and choi 2010 details are described in text s2 an aqcdi cell with similar configuration to those used in other studies li et al 2009 2018 was assembled fig s1 and the details can be found in our previous work nie et al 2018 for control experiments an anion exchange membrane aem or cation exchange membrane cem with the same dimension as mwcnt electrode was placed in front of the mwcnt electrode fig s1 and the assembled unit was named as aqcdi aem or aqcdi cem 2 3 removal of organic pollutants batch experiments were performed in a continuously recycling system nie et al 2018 and ph of the solution of organic pollutant was not buffered unless specified more details are provided in text s3 2 4 analytical methods a

case of acyclovir removal fig 1 a adsorption desorption equilibrium of the organics onto mwcnt electrode was reached in 90 min and mwcnt electrode itself could adsorb a certain amount of acyclovir due to the large specific surface area ssa 442 m2 g 1 of mwcnts nie et al 2018 after adding pds into the acyclovir solution the concentration of organic compound was further decreased without the applying of voltage on the aqcdi unit cell aqcdi pds 0v ascribing to the reason that the s2o8 2 ions flowing through the surface of mwcnt electrode could be effectively activated to generate ros for oxidizing acyclovir guan et al 2017 a control experiment with acyclovir oxidation by pds alone indicated that pds itself could hardly oxidize acyclovir once a constant voltage of 1 2 v was imposed on the aqcdi unit cell connecting mwcnt electrode to the positive pole or negative pole of the power was referred as aqcdi pds 1 2v or aqcdi pds 1 2v respectively quicker degradation of acyclovir was achieved with respect to the aqcdi pds 0v system suggesting that the polarization of mwcnts catalysts accelerated the abatement of organic pollutant remarkably to explain such enhanced performance electrosorption of acyclovir by the aqcdi unit cell and degradation of acyclovir with a qcdi unit cell composed of two graphite sheets electrodes g qcdi were studied it was observed that a significant amount of acyclovir was removed upon positive polarization aqcdi 1 2v or negative polarization aqcdi 1 2v of mwcnt electrode attributable to the reason that the dipole moment of the organic compound is increased due to the changes of surface charge density on the c surface upon positive or negative polarization and thus enhances the π π interaction between the aromatic rings of organic compound and the surface of mwcnt electrodes bayram and ayranci 2010 notably higher removal efficiency of acyclovir was achieved by aqcdi 1 2v 67 than aqcdi 1 2v 46 which possibly because a small amount of cationic acyclovir may be present in the solution resulting from the partially dissociation of electron accepting groups in acyclovir molecule under the electric field and the cationic acyclovir was attracted onto the surface of mwcnt cathode however graphite paper could barely adsorb the organic compound and only 10 acyclovir was degraded in 180 min by pds activation with the g qcdi unit cell under a voltage of 1 2 v as known graphite paper shows low ssa and poor catalytic activity towards pds activation lee et al 2015 by replacing one graphite paper electrode with mwcnt electrode in the g qcdi unit cell the higher catalytic activity and electrosorption capacity of mwcnts endowed by the larger ssa and unique nanostructures can improve both the pds activation efficiency and the adsorption of acyclovir resulting in elevated degradation performance in addition the close interaction between the electrochemically adsorbed organic molecules and surface reactive species generated from pds activation at the electrode facilitates the electron transport between them and promotes the oxidation of pollutants in the case of phenol removal fig 1b the adsorption desorption equilibrium onto mwcnt electrode was reached in 50 min and around 12 phenol was removed by adsorption similarly g qcdi pds 1 2v showed poor degradation performance while both aqcdi pds 1 2v 97 and aqcdi pds 1 2v 58 systems exhibited higher removal efficiency than aqcdi pds 0v 55 verifying that the synergistic effect between the electrosorption of organic compound onto mwcnt electrode which was demonstrated in the control experiments and carbocatalysis driven pds activation could enhance the abatement of organic pollutants unlike acyclovir higher removal efficiency of phenol was achieved by aqcdi 1 2v 61 than aqcdi 1 2v 30 possibly because phenol molecules contain electron donating groups which are preferentially attracted onto mwcnt anode another point to note that the aqcdi pds 1 2v system outperformed the aqcdi pds 1 2v system in both acyclovir and phenol removal the improved performance of aqcdi pds 1 2v system for phenol removal can be related to the higher electrosorption efficiency of mwcnt anode than mwcnt cathode however decreased electrosorptive removal of acyclovir was achieved with mwcnt anode compared to mwcnt cathode this phenomena unveiled that the polarization of mwcnt electrode may exert influence on the pds activation and mwcnt anode was more efficient than the mwcnt cathode for pds activation consistent with the previous work song et al 2017 moreover the variations of pds concentration in aqcdi pds 1 2v system and aqcdi pds 1 2v system fig s2 confirmed that more pds were decomposed on the mwcnt anode it is worth mentioning that although aqcdi pds 1 2v system only showed a little higher phenol removal efficiency than aqcdi pds 0v system in which fresh mwcnts were used the performance of the former remained stable while the latter declined gradually in three consecutive tests fig 1c these results disclosed that the active sites present in mwcnts predominantly reacted with pds during the activation process while the charges on the surface of mwcnt cathode could assist the pds activation when the active sites were gradually consumed in recycling tests it has been proposed that the during the process of anodic activation of pds at pt anode s2o8 2 ions firstly migrate to the anode by the coulombic force and then the electron configuration of the ions are rearranged under the influence of surface positive charges of anode resulting in the formation of a transition state of pds molecule bounded on the pt anode which serves as the primary nonradical reactive species responsible for organic pollutants degradation song et al 2018 to understand if the electrostatic attraction could also enhance the pds activation at polarized mwcnt electrode ion exchange membranes are introduced into the aqcdi unit cell and the acyclovir degradation behaviors of the resultant unit cells were evaluated fig 1d shows that the aqcdi cem pds 1 2v system only gave a total removal efficiency of 29 while the adsorption of organic pollutant onto mwcnt electrode accounted for 20 revealing the low effectiveness for pds activation compared to aqcdi cem pds 1 2v system aqcdi aem pds 1 2v system gave a higher total removal efficiency of 49 which should arise from the reason that the cation selectivity of cem inhibited the electrosorption of s2o8 2 ions onto the surface of mwcnt anode and thus suppressed the pds activation the above results demonstrated that the electrostatic attraction between pds and mwcnt anode play an important role during the process of pds activation at mwcnt anode for comparison acyclovir degradation by aqcdi aem pds 0v system and electrosorptive removal of acyclovir by acdi aem 1 2v system were also tested as seen aqcdi aem pds 0v system achieved a much lower removal efficiency 23 than aqcdi pds 0v system which is likely because that the ion exchange membrane in front of mwcnt electrode was fouled by the organic substances tanaka et al 2012 and thus hindered the permeation of pds in the flowing solution onto the surface of mwcnt electrode abating the carbocatalysis additionally the lower electrosorptive removal of acyclovir by aqcdi aem 1 2v system 26 than aqcdi 1 2v system 46 suggested that the presence of ion exchange membrane also hinders the electrosorption of organic compound onto mwcnt electrode due to the fouling effect as a consequence of the inhibitory effect of aem on acyclovir electrosorption and catalysis driven pds activation decreased performance of aqcdi aem pds 1 2v system than aqcdi pds 1 2v system was obtained 3 2 quenching experiments methanol is popularly used as radical scavenger for both so4 and ho k s o 4 2 5 10 7 m 1 s 1 k h o 9 7 10 8 m 1 s 1 according to the reference buxton et al 1988 and singlet oxygen 1o2 can be scavenged by nan3 k o 1 2 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 or furfuryl alcohol ffa k o 1 2 1 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 chen et al 2018 to discern the primary reactive species during mwcnts powders catalyzed pds activation and polarized mwcnts catalyzed pds activation the scavengers were separately added into the aqueous solution using acyclovir as the model compound ffa nan3 was used here because 1o2 has been recently reported as the primary ros in pds activation by cnts and biochar cheng et al 2017 yin et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 fig 2 a and b shows that the presence of methanol and ffa nan3 barely inhibited the degradation of acyclovir suggesting that both mwcnts pds and aqcdi pds 1 2v oxidative systems are not relied on either free radicals or 1o2 during the pds activation process epr measurements further supported that neither free radicals nor 1o2 was involved in the mwcnts pds system fig s3 hence surface bounded activated pds in a metastable state is proposed to dominate the oxidation in the above two systems via a nonradical manner to attack the organic substance by electron abstraction in accordance with the reported works guan et al 2017 song et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 quenching experiments with aqcdi pds 1 2v system fig 2c revealed that nonradical oxidation pathway was also responsible for the activation of pds at the mwcnt cathode quite differing from the commonly reported sulfate radicals dominated cathodic activation of pds process which was stimulated by electrolysis at high working voltages chen et al 2014 chen and huang 2015 it would be interesting to investigate if the increase of voltage could lead to the generation of free radicals from pds activation at mwcnt cathode first a voltage of 2 v was applied to the mwcnt electrode and degradation efficiency of acyclovir was measured then quenching experiment with 1 m methanol under the same voltage was conducted after that we repeated the two experiments on the same electrode as shown in fig 2d although acyclovir degradation in the two quenching experiments was partially inhibited compared with two control experiments without methanol the performance of aqcdi pds 2v system gradually decreased after the first two cycles hence the increase of working voltage for cathodic activation may not induce a radical system but resulted in decay of performances this could possibly be attributed to the faradaic reactions occurred at carbon outer layer which gave rise to partial surface oxidation when a high voltage was applied he et al 2016 3 3 electrochemical analysis to illustrate the involved mechanism for aqcdi pds 1 2v and aqcdi pds 1 2v systems lsv measurement was performed to analyze the electron transfer between the reactants and electrode surface fig 3 a depicts a minor current increase with the addition of acyclovir or pds alone implying the negligible electron transfer between pds or acyclovir and mwcnt electrode however the current increased slightly once the scanning voltage was above 1 05 v when acyclovir and pds were simultaneously present indicating that oxidation of acyclovir occurred on the surface of carbon electrode therefore we speculate that when s2o8 2 ion was adsorbed onto the mwcnt anode it was transformed into an activated state stimulated by the electric charge at the mwcnt electrode without decomposed into sulfate radicals while the activated pds could react with the organic molecules when they were also present in the solution to produce sulfate ions which gave rise to a slight increase of current an identical tendency was present in fig 3b when a negative potential was applied to the mwcnt electrode revealing the same activation mechanism involved at the mwcnt cathode the similar lsv measurements were also observed for ec ti pt anode pds cnt pds and graphitized nanodiamonds pds g nd pds systems lee et al 2016 2015 song et al 2017 ma et al recently proposed that lsv may not be a suitable characterization method for identifying the mechanism of pds activation in cnt pds or g nd pds based nonradical systems as the involved pds activation is a heterogeneous process instead of an electrochemical process song et al 2017 our results in this work demonstrated that the pds could be electrochemically activated by nanocarbon electrode which contributed to the signals in the lsv measurements supporting the ma s perspective 3 4 theoretical investigation on the pds activation by charged mwcnt electrode although the above results indicated that the activation pathway of pds by mwcnts was not altered by the polarization of mwcnts the influence of positive or negative surface charges of mwcnts on the structures and electronic states of the activated pds is unknown to this end density functional theory dft modeling which has been widely employed to elucidate the reactions occurring at the surface of carbonaceous electrodes as well as the intricate interaction between persulfates and carbocatalysts chen et al 2018 duan et al 2018a 2016 was adopted to simulate the possible adsorption configurations of s2o8 2 anion adsorbed onto the surface of polarized cnt electrode under different electrical fields upward positive electric field denotes anode while downward negative electric field denotes cathode as shown in fig 4 details of the modeling are provided in supplementary materials text s5 corresponding adsorption energy the quantity of atonic charge on s2o8 2 anion by hirshfeld analysis q length of o o bond lo o s o bond ls o of the most stable structures for adsorbed s2o8 2 anion were summarized in table 1 note that swcnt was adopted to simplify the model structure because the electronic properties of perfect mwcnts are rather similar to those of perfect swcnts and the number of cnt walls slightly affects the adsorption baughman et al 2002 wang et al 2010 in addition an electric field with different directions was applied to simulate the effect of the polarized electrode in the dft calculations however the intensity in the dft calculations was different from that in experiments the intensity of the electric field f was adopted in the range of 10 3 au 1 au 5 14 1011 v m 1 as most of dft works used in this work ao and peeters 2010 wu et al 2014 and the much higher f in simulation than that in experiment was used to compensate for a short time in dft works xu and chen 2018 herein we focused on the effects of the trend of the f as well as its direction on the adsorption of pds when swcnt was negatively polarized under a negative electric field the calculated eads decreased and the absolute value of q increased gradually with the rise of f compared to neutral swcnt suggesting that the interaction and charge transfer between s2o8 2 anion and swnct was suppressed this should be ascribed to the reason that the coulombic repulsive force between s2o8 2 anion and swnct cathode weakens the interaction between them however the lo o of s2o8 2 anion gradually increased with the electrical field accompanying with the decrease of ls o with respect to the case of neutral swcnt indicating that the surface negative charges on swcnt could induce the further stretch of o o bond but contraction of s o bond in the electron enriched s2o8 2 anion especially when an electrical field of 0 001 au was imposed on swcnt electrode the eads decreased a little while the o o bond was elongated significantly showing that negative polarization of mwcnt with a small electrical field favors the pds activation consistent with our experimental results such activated pds with longer o o bond than that in the case of neutral swcnt may possess stronger oxidizing ability for organic pollutants thus enhancing the degradation performance particularly it was found that the o o bond was cleaved after charging 3e in the structure optimization fig s4 which agrees with the literature reporting the generation of so4 from cathodic activation of pds during electrolysis process chen et al 2014 zeng et al 2016 thereby the experimental evidences and dft calculations illustrated that negative polarization of mwcnt electrode could further stretch the o o bond of surface bounded activated pds and facilitate the electron transfer from mwcnt cathode to s2o8 2 anion which boost the elimination of organic pollutants in the case of swcnt anode the derived eads improved with f and these values were much higher than those obtained in the cases of both neutral swnct and swcnt cathode the higher eads obtained for swcnt anode confirms that the electrostatic attraction between s2o8 2 anion and swcnt anode could improve the interaction between them and thus the activation efficiency of pds in accordance with the experimental results meanwhile the electron transfer between s2o8 2 anion and swcnt anode was increased with f as the q absolute value was reduced gradually we deduced that changing the polarization of cnt from negative to positive induced the reverse of the charge density on cnts which rendered the positively polarized cnt electron deficient see fig s5 and such cnt of electron deficiency could attract the electrons in s2o8 2 anion and may improve the electron transfer between the organic pollutant and surface bounded activated pds via a nonradical pathway surprisingly we discovered that the ls o of s2o8 2 anion was raised remarkably while the lo o was reduced with the electrical field compared to neutral swcnt which opposite to the tendency in the case of swcnt cathode this phenomena implies that negative charges and positive charges on the surface of mwcnt electrode have different influences on the electronic configuration of the activated pds and the interaction between s2o8 2 anion and swcnt anode mainly affected the electron arrangements of s o bond in activated pds furthermore for the purpose of comparing the oxidative capacity of the three kinds of activated s2o8 2 anions the chemical potential μ and global electrophilicity index ω of adsorbed s2o8 2 which are considered as indicators of the oxidative capacity of activated s2o8 2 anions the higher μ and ω mean the higher oxidative capacity under different f were also calculated see text s5 and table s1 for calculation details and listed in table 1 as displayed both the calculated μ and ω of adsorbed s2o8 2 anion in the case of swcnt anode were higher compared to the case of neutral swcnt and these values ascended dramatically with the raised f indicating the remarkable increase of electronegativity of adsorbed s2o8 2 anion when cnt was positively polarized this observation could be ascribed to the reason that the losses of electrons lead to more molecular orbitals in s2o8 2 anion and thus the energy of lumo of s2o8 2 anion adsorbed onto swcnt anode was sharply declined compared to the s2o8 2 anion adsorbed onto neutral swcnt based on the above results it was deduced that the activated s2o8 2 anion with further stretched s o bond bounded to mwcnt anode exhibited much higher oxidative capacity than that bound to neutral mwcnt which could enhance the degradation of organic pollutants by aqcdi pds 1 2v system in the case of swnct cathode the derived μ and ω of adsorbed s2o8 2 anion under different f were also increased relative to the case of neutral swcnt while these values were not as high as those obtained for swcnt anode implying a little higher oxidative capacity of the activated s2o8 2 anion with further stretched o o bond combining the experimental and theoretical results it is demonstrated that both the negative and positive polarization of mwcnt electrode can affect both the electronic state and oxidative capacity of activated pds bounded to the surface of non polarized mwcnts and enhance the pds activation but they exert different influences on activated pds the negative polarization mainly results in the stretch of o o bond and a slight increase of oxidative capacity of activated pds while positive polarization can elongate the s o bond in activated pds and improve its oxidative capacity dramatically in addition compared with negative polarization the positive polarization of mwcnt electrode promotes the adsorption of s2o8 2 anions onto mwcnt anode due to the electrostatic attraction force consequently improving the pds activation efficiency and the removal of organic pollutants possible mechanism of removal of organic pollutants by aqcdi pds 1 2v system was proposed in scheme 1 first s2o8 2 ions and organic molecules are co adsorbed onto the surface of mwcnts by the electrostatic field then the length of s o bond in adsorbed s2o8 2 is stretched by the active sites and s2o8 2 transfers electrons to the surface of mwcnts turning the s2o8 2 into an activated state the activated s2o8 2 s2o8 2 manifests a strong oxidative capacity lee et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 due to the close interaction of activated pds carbon complex and organic molecules on the mwcnt electrode organic molecules can be efficiently oxidized to donate electrons and s2o8 2 is converted to so4 2 and then released to the bulk solution due to the oxidation and mineralization of the adsorbed organic compound organic molecules in the solution can be continuously adsorbed onto the mwcnt electrode and react with s2o8 2 giving rise to an enhanced elimination performance 3 5 stability of aqcdi pds 1 2v system for acyclovir degradation the stability is an important factor for application of pds based oxidative system in practical organic pollutants treatment whereas most carbocatalysts suffer from poor stability the aqcdi pds 1 2v system was tested for 11 cycles and the acyclovir degradation efficiencies are shown in fig 5 it was demonstrated that the degradation efficiency only decreased slightly less than 5 after 11 cycles implying a good reusability of aqcdi pds 1 2v system for catalytic oxidation the aqcdi pds 1 2v system was also tested for 3 cycles and the acyclovir degradation efficiencies are shown in fig s6 clearly the degradation efficiency barely decreased in the 3 cycles compared to the mwcnts pds system the better stability of polarized mwcnts catalyzed pds activation system may be attributed to the reasons that the continuous charges on the surface of mwcnts which serve as persulfate activators reduce the loss of active sites in mwcnts and the polarization of mwcnt electrodes probably prevent the coverage of certain kinds of intermediates on the surface of mwcnts more cycles will be conducted in future studies to evaluate the long term operation of aqcdi pds 1 2v system 3 6 energy consumption of aqcdi pds system for organic pollutants removal to promote the practical application of polarized mwcnt catalyzed pds activation with an aqcdi unit cell for organic pollutants abatement energy consumption is an important economical index to be taken into account in this work the toc removal efficiency and specific energy consumption per unit toc mass removed ectoc text s6 dominguez et al 2018 of different organic pollutants were evaluated for aqcdi pds 1 2v and aqcdi pds 1 2v systems table 2 it can be seen that higher mineralization rate and lower ectoc were achieved by aqcdi pds 1 2v system compared to the electro oxidation process and electro fenton process the derived ectoc is usually more than 0 1 kwh gtoc 1 dominguez et al 2018 sirés et al 2014 the calculated ectoc in this work were much lower demonstrating that polarized mwcnts catalyzed pds activation is an energy efficient approach for wastewater remediation nevertheless both acyclovir and phenol could be almost completely degraded by aqcdi pds 1 2v system a much higher ectoc was achieved for acyclovir removal this is because the intermediates during acyclovir degradation were more persistent and more difficult to be mineralized li et al 2016 as evidenced by the lower toc removal based on the above results it is proposed that our aqcdi pds 1 2v system may serve as an alternative to other electrochemical oxidative systems for abatement of organic pollutants which can be easily mineralized like phenol in real wastewater in terms of energy consumption 3 7 influence of ph on acyclovir degradation by aqcdi pds 1 2v system to explore the adaptable ph ranges of aqcdi pds 1 2v system the oxidation was performed at different initial ph of 2 4 6 8 10 as displayed in fig 6 a the ph values present marginal impact on catalytic degradation suggesting that aqcdi pds 1 2v system can maintain the high oxidative efficiency within a wide ph range 3 8 influence of voltage on acyclovir degradation by aqcdi pds system during the electrosorption process the voltage is a critical factor controlling the electrosorption capacity of peroxide ions and organic compounds the rising voltage can lead to a stronger electrostatic attraction of ions and organics to the electrode giving rise to a faster pds activation and higher degradation efficiency as expected acyclovir degradation was accelerated when the voltage was increased from 0 4 v to 1 2 v fig 6b however further increase of voltage leads to the declined degradation of acyclovir probably due to the occurrence of redox reaction on the mwcnt anode resulting from the water hydrolysis 1 23 v therefore 1 2 v is the optimal voltage for aqcdi pds system in this work 3 9 influence of pds concentration on acyclovir degradation by aqcdi pds 1 2v system different loadings of pds were added into the acyclovir solution in the aqcdi pds 1 2v system as shown in fig 6c clearly the acyclovir degradation was accelerated with the increase of pds concentration during the electro activation the mass transport of pds towards the electrode surface was facilitated at higher pds concentrations which is beneficial to the electro activation process and acyclovir degradation 3 10 influence of presence of inorganic ions on the degradation of acyclovir by aqcdi pds 1 2v system salts and diverse natural organic matters are ubiquitous in the industrial and domestic wastewater it has been reported that chloride ions cl hco3 and co3 2 ions can affect the degradation of organic pollutants in radical based aops because of the non selective nature anipsitakis et al 2006 bennedsen et al 2012 yang et al 2014 however the influence of inorganic ions on the nonradical oxidation from mwcnt anode catalyzed pds activation is still unclear therefore the influence of anions with different valences including cl co3 2 and po4 3 on acyclovir degradation by aqcdi pds 1 2v system was investigated in this work in so4 based aops systems cl can be oxidized into chlorine radicals by so4 the chlorine radicals may enhance or inhibit the degradation of organic pollutants which is dependent on the properties of the target organic compounds yang et al 2014 for nonradical oxidation process several studies have demonstrated that the degradation of organic pollutants could hardly be affected by the presence of cl probably due to the low reactivity of generated ros for cl duan et al 2018b lee et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 in this study fig 7 a manifested that addition of 11 1 mm nacl barely inhibited the acyclovir degradation by aqcdi pds 1 2v system the degradation rate was somehow depressed at the beginning but the acyclovir could still be completely removed within 120 min when 22 2 mm nacl was added probably because the two cl anions competed with one s2o8 2 anions to be electrochemically adsorbed onto the surface of mwcnt anode with the further increase of nacl concentration pds may be partially activated by nacl chen et al 2016 yuan et al 2011 resulting in a slightly improved degradation of acyclovir overall the above results also confirmed that nonradical oxidation pathway plays the dominated role in mwcnt anode catalyzed pds activation carbonate is an important scavenger of free radicals to generate co3 which has a lower reactivity with respect to so4 and ho bennedsen et al 2012 therefore the effect of co3 2 on the degradation of acyclovir was investigated fig 7b shows that the addition of 11 1 mm co3 2 slightly inhibited the degradation of acyclovir which possibly resulted from the competitive electrosorption between co3 2 and s2o8 2 onto the mwcnt electrode both of which are negatively charged with the same valence the rapid decrease of acyclovir concentration at the beginning of the degradation process is probably because that co3 2 may also decompose pds to produce reactive species for acyclovir oxidation jiang et al 2017 the fact that activation efficiency of pds is related to the electrosorption capacity of the s2o8 2 ions was further verified when po4 3 ions were present in the aqcdi pds 1 2v system clearly a significant inhibitory effect on the acyclovir degradation was observed when 11 1 mm po4 3 was added it has been reported that the normalized capacity of activated carbon electrodes for various anions increased with the ionic strength of the anions chen et al 2015 thereby electrosorption of s2o8 2 onto mwcnt anode were suppressed when po4 3 and s2o8 2 ions were both present in the solution giving rise to a declined pds activation and acyclovir degradation 4 conclusions in summary enhanced elimination of organic contaminants in aqueous solution by polarized mwcnts catalyzed pds activation using an aqcdi unit cell than mwcnts pds system was demonstrated compared with mwcnt cathode activation of pds at mwcnt anode attained higher degradation efficiency due to the electrostatic attraction between s2o8 2 anions and anode surface bounded activated pds was revealed to be the primary ros involved in the nonradical oxidation pathway induced from both mwcnts pds and aqcdi pds oxidative systems but the structures electronic states and oxidative capacity of activated pds in these systems were different dft calculations suggested that positive polarization of mwcnt electrode further enlarged the s o bond of surface adsorbed s2o8 2 and improved its oxidative capacity remarkably whereas negative polarization of mwcnt electrode resulted in a larger stretch of o o bond and a little increase of oxidative capacity of the adsorbed activated s2o8 2 in addition aqcdi pds 1 2v system was found to be more stable than the mwcnts pds system for acyclovir degradation the optimized conditions for aqcdi pds system to remove acyclovir was respectively 1 2 v and 11 1 mm pds and the optimized system could be adapted to a wide ph range 2 10 ectoc as the economic factor was calculated for aqcdi pds 1 2v system and a low cost of energy was demonstrated for this system the presence of high concentration of cl could hardly impede the acyclovir degradation while presence of co3 2 or po4 3 inhibited the degradation due to the competitive adsorption between s2o8 2 with co3 2 or po4 3 using positively polarized mwcnt electrode for pds activation may serve as an energy saving and efficient technology for practical remediation of aqueous organic pollutants declaration

18462,phenolic wastewater containing phenol and 4 chlorophenol pose a risk to the environment and to human health treating them using chemical biological coupling method is challenging in this study manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob were enriched in moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr using synthetic phenol wastewater 800 mg l 1 to facilitate in situ production of biogenic manganese oxides biomnox after 90 days of operation then 4 chlorophenol 4 cp was added to the mbbr to simulate mixed phenolic wastewater comparing the mbbr r1 without feeding mn ii and the mbbr with biomnox r2 production r2 exhibited robust phenol and 4 cp removal performance 16s rrna gene sequencing was employed to determine the microbial community subsequently a batch experiment demonstrated that partly purified biomnox does not exhibits a capacity for phenol removal but can efficiently remove 4 cp interestingly 5 chloro 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde was found in the products of 4 cp degradation which was the unique product of 4 cp degradation by catechol 2 3 dioxygenase c23o in both reactors only catechol 1 2 dioxygenase c12o activity from microbes can be detected indicating that the existence of biomnox provide an alternative pathway in addition to microbe driven 4 cp degradation overall mbbr based mnob enrichment under high phenol concentration was achieved and 4 cp phenol removal can be accelerated by in situ formed biomnox considering the c23o like activity of biomnox our results suggest a new coupling strategy that involves nanomaterials and a microbial consortium graphical abstract image 1 keywords phenol 4 chlorophenol microbial community biogenic manganese oxides moving bed biofilm reactor 1 introduction manganese oxides mnox x between 1 and 2 are one of the strongest oxidants naturally found in aquatic and terrestrial environment learman et al 2011 the redox potentials of various mnox are usually between 500 and 600 mv and thus these compounds can oxidize a wide range of organic compounds including anti inflammatory drugs and steroidal hormones furgal et al 2014 meanwhile when mnox is present at the nanoscale the high surface area and polymorphic structures makes them powerful sorbents for metal ions e g pb ii ni ii co ii cu ii and zn ii zhou et al 2015 for acidic and neutral ph levels most of the mnox is generated by microbes because chemical mn ii oxidation for these conditions is thermodynamically unfavourable tebo et al 2004 until now diverse mn ii oxidation bacteria mnob have been isolated and used to produce biogenic manganese oxides biomnox under mild condition tebo et al 2005 compared with chemogenic mnox biomnox is usually weakly crystallized and has more mn iv vacancies and larger surface areas these characteristics cause biomnox to possess a higher activity for the oxidation of organic pollutants forrez et al 2010 although identified mnob are phylogenetically diverse all of them are obligate heterotrophs hansel 2017 however cultivation of mnob in an open system is difficult due to the competition with those fast growing heterotrophs previous work has used the low concentrations of organic carbon excreted by autotrophic nitrifiers and methane oxidizing bacteria to support the growth of mnob matsushita et al 2018 cao et al 2015 nevertheless this strategy is not suitable for industrial wastewater with high cod for instance phenolic compounds such as phenol and chlorophenols are regarded as priority hazardous organic pollutants high concentration of phenol 2 8 10 000 mg l 1 can be found in wastewater from petroleum refining coal processing and resin production ren et al 2018 during the chlorination treatment process of wastewater containing phenol 4 chlorophenol 4 cp can form and possess a higher toxicity even at relatively low concentrations carucci et al 2010 on the other hand ni ii and phenol are often encountered together in wastewater from the steel metal plating and painting industries aksu and akpinar 2000 the toxicity of ni ii to microbes is often hinders biological treatment considering the priority of eliminating phenolic in wastewater the excellent reactivity and absorption capacity of mno2 towards phenolic compounds and heavy metals phenolic wastewater is a good candidate for investigating the possibility of mnob enrichment under high cod conditions and the potential coupling between chemical oxidation biomnox and biodegradation a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr relies on biofilms that attach to the surfaces of small plastic carriers which are suspended and mixed in a reactor casas et al 2015 this configuration guarantees the enrichment of slow growing bacteria such as nitrifiers in the carrier making it attractive for enhancing nitrification young et al 2017 hence it is reasonable to attempt to enrich the mnob in a mbbr to avoid competitive weakness with the other heterotrophs meanwhile there were also successful examples that used mbbr to remove organic pollutants zhou et al 2018a tang et al 2017 ooi et al 2017 therefore mbbr is an ideal configuration to explore the coupling effects of biomnox and bacterial community for pollutant removal accordingly a mbbr based mnob enrichment strategy was presumed to support the simultaneous growth of phenolic degrading bacteria and mnob the aims of this study were 1 to facilitate mnob enrichment in a mbbr under high phenol concentration 2 to compare the long term phenol and 4 cp removal performance between mbbrs with and without biomnox and 3 to decipher the role of biomnox in shaping a bacterial consortium and for phenolic removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals agents and synthetic wastewater catechol phenol 4 cp mncl2 and nicl2 were purchased from sinochem co ltd the chemogenic δ mno2 birnessite was obtained according to a previous report liu et al 2018 synthetic phenolic wastewater consisted of the following compounds according to a previous work with the addition of approximate amount of 4 cp 600 800 mg l 1 of phenol 10 30 mg l 1 4 cp 20 mg l 1 kh2po4 90 mg l 1 nh4cl 10 mg l 1 nacl 12 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o and 12 mg l 1 of cacl2 zhou et al 2018a all reagents used were of analytical grade and were used without further purification 2 2 reactor setup and operation a pair of mbbrs 2 l laboratory scale plexiglass reactor were used in this study with a sequencing batch mode r1 was the control reactor without feeding mn ii while r2 was used to enrich mnob phenol adapted biofilm coated carriers anoxkaldnes k1 7 mm 9 mm were obtained from a mbbr operated to treat simulated ph shocked phenol wastewater and the filling ratios were 30 for both r1 and r2 zhou et al 2018a an air pump coupled with a porous stone diffuser was used to ensure high aeration in the reactors and the dissolved oxygen content was maintained at 4 5 mg l 1 for the adaptive phase only phenol was fed as the sole carbon source for the treatment of simulated phenolic wastewater various concentrations of 4 cp were added after the adaptive phase mn ii was added to r2 to enrich mnob and to produce biomnox in situ ni ii was added to both mbbrs in the last phase due to its frequent co existence with phenol in various types of wastewater and it may exhibit an interaction with microbes and with biomnox the details of the influent phenol mn ii ni ii and 4 cp concentrations along with the hydraulic retention time hrt are listed in table 1 2 3 characterization of biomnox for characterization in situ formed biogenic manganese oxides were either directly collected or partly purified for the former case 5 randomly selected carriers were sonicated in 50 ml ultrapure water for 0 5 h to cause the biofilms to fall off and the solids were collected by centrifuging at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the pellets were then freeze dried the lyophilized powder was ground for further characterization and batch experiments to obtain partly purified biomnox procedures modified from a previous work were used jiang et al 2010 briefly 5 mg biomnox was first treated in a 10 ml mixture of methanol chloroform h2o 12 5 3 v v with 30 min of sonication this procedure was to extract cell materials with mnox then the supernatant was discarded and the precipitates were washed three times with double distilled water ddw the absorbed mn ii in the precipitates was eliminated by adding 0 1 m hcl into ddw to a final ph of 3 0 the precipitates were then further treated with 0 17 w v naocl in a shaking bath 150 rpm 4 h to remove the remaining solid organic matters finally the product was rinsed 3 times with ddw and was dried in vacuum overnight 70 c for further use the as synthesized and partly purified products were characterized by environmental scanning electron microscopy esem scanning electron microscopy sem

oxidation performance batch experiments were performed to evaluate the oxidation capacity of biomnox towards phenol and 4 cp briefly 20 ml phenol or 4 cp solution was adjusted to ph 7 0 and the final concentration of phenol and 4 cp were 100 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 respectively nacl 20 mm was added to the same solution to guarantee the similar ion strength the reaction with phenol or 4 cp was initiated by adding 5 mg pristine biomnox several control experiments were performed simultaneously including chemically synthesized δ mno2 10 mm nan3 treated biomnox to inhibit the microbial activity

mettler toledo switzerland was used to determine the ph values mn ii and ni ii concentration were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry techcomp aa6100 china the influent effluent samples and supernatant from the batch experiments were filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane and acidified with 1 of concentrated hno3 the limit of detection for mn ii and ni ii were both 0 05 mg l 1 the formation of manganese oxides was qualitatively determined using a leucoberbelin blue lbb assay learman et al 2011 phenol and 4 cp concentrations were analyzed using an agilent 1290 infinity ii ultra

phenol 4 cp and mn ii concentrations were determined twice within a hrt since stage 3 the sampling time for phenol and 4 cp were 36 h and 72 h for day 90 214 24 h and 48 h for days 214 224 and 12 h and 24 h for days 224 238 for mn ii the sampling times were 24 h and 72 h for days 45 181 12 h and 72 h for days 181 214 and 12 h and 24 h for days 214 238 2 6 microbial community analysis biofilm samples were taken at day 1 day 45 day 90 day 180 day 214 day 233 and day 238 corresponding to stage 0 stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 stage 4 stage 5 stage 6 and stage 7 of r1 and r2 respectively at each stage biofilms coated on five randomly chosen carriers were detached and were filtered through 0 45 μm filter paper the following genomic dna extraction pcr and sequencing procedures are the same as discussed in our previous report zhou et al 2018a high throughput sequencing was conducted on an illumina hiseq2500 platform novogene beijing china for bioinformatics analysis quality filtering on the

for all of the figures the stages are abbreviated as sta for brevity e g sta1 sta2 and so on 3 results and discussion 3 1 phenol and mn ii removal performance in mbbr in our previous work mbbr was been used to facilitate the treatment of phenol wastewater zhou et al 2018a hence the phenol adapted microbial consortium was used as the initial inoculums as the biomnox production and accumulation usually need relatively long times up to several days in pure cultures the hrt was first set to 72 h for stage 1 days 0 45 the phenol removal ratios reached approximately 90 for both reactors while no significant blackish colour appeared in r2 during this period and no mn ii removal could be detected for stage 2 day 45 90 the biofilm coatings on the carriers of r2 became brownish and the lbb assay confirmed the formation of biomnox fig s1 as shown in fig 1 a the proportions of phenol removal for r1 and r2 were generally approximately 90 but the phenol removal rate of r2 had larger fluctuation 3 58 5 06 mg l 1 d 1 than r1 3 91 4 88 mg l 1 d 1 these fluctuation may have been caused by the toxicity of mn ii to phenol degrading bacteria fig 1b shows the mn ii removal performance in r2 it could be observed that within each hrt the mn ii removal rates at 24 h were generally negative while these rates became positive at 72 h a negative mn ii removal rate means regeneration of mn ii has occurred which may be due to the release of mn ii release from cell lysis bacteria mediated mn iv reduction and possible reactions between phenol and biomnox for the last 4 cycles day 77 90 the final mn ii concentrations in the effluent were all below 0 5 mg l 1 and the mn ii removal rate remained near 0 014 0 017 mg l 1 d 1 as the ph in r2 stayed around 7 0 data not shown the contribution of chemical mn ii oxidation can be omitted due to the high redox potential 0 6 v required matsushita et al 2018 hence enrichment of mnob in r2 was successful the esem images further showed the difference of the biofilms in r1 and r2 the surfaces of the carriers in r1 were dominated by cocci while the biofilms in r2 consisted mainly of rod shaped bacteria figs s2a and b moreover many nanoscale particles were observed on the biofilm of r2 to further confirm the composition of these nanoparticles hrtem and edx were employed fig s2c shows typical sheet like nanomaterials and the results of edx implied that the nanomaterials contained mn and fe indicating that the products were mixtures of mn and fe oxides with an mn fe atomic ratio of 1 20 fig s3 a more precise mn fe atomic ratio was calculated through the result of icp ms and was approximately 1 4 4 34 mn and 15 78 fe for pristine biogenic biomnox the source of fe oxides can be biogenic or chemogenic which have been reported to form fe mn oxides bai et al 2016 peng et al 2015 3 2 long term operational performance of mbbrs after enrichment for both phenol degrading bacteria and mnob the reactors r1 and r2 were operated for an additional 148 days under various conditions day 91 238 as the hrt was chosen to facilitate the mn ii oxidation which was usually slower than the phenol and 4 cp degradation the phenol 4 cp and mn ii concentrations and corresponding removal rate were also determined at specific time intervals in each hrt generally r2 possessed higher phenol removal rate and robust performance when suffering shocking conditions during days 91 112 the residual phenol concentration of r2 at 36 h 0 5 hrt had gradually decreased from 600 to 0 mg l 1 and remained at 0 mg l 1 until day 181 after increasing the 4 cp concentration day 181 214 shortening the hrt days 214 233 or adding ni ii days 234 238 the phenol concentrations for both reactors at 0 5 hrt began to fluctuate while the residual phenol concentrations in r2 were still lower than those in r1 fig 2 a at the end of each hrt the phenol concentrations in the r2 effluent were generally undetectable after day 100 while the corresponding phenol concentrations in r1 the effluent could be measured at days 180 212 and at day 234 238 the differences in phenol degradation in r1 and r2 were major when compared to the phenol removal rates at 0 5 hrt rate 1 than the whole hrt rate 2 because most of the phenol was degraded at the first half of the hrt fig 2b the maximum phenol removal rates for r1 and r2 were 15 3 and 22 18 mg l 1 d 1 respectively using the data of 0 5 hrt which suggested that r2 had better phenol removal performance than r1 for 4 cp both reactors exhibited nearly completely removal at day 90 180 when increasing 4 cp concentration and shortening the hrt r2 showed a more robust removal performance for 4 cp than r1 and still completely remove 4 cp after day 210 for r1 the effluent 4 cp concentrations fluctuated between 0 and 9 8 mg l 1 fig 2c similar to the phenol degradation the differences in 4 cp removal rates between r1 and r2 were large at 0 5 hrt especially after 200 days fig 2d the maximum 4 cp removal rates for r1 and r2 were 0 82 and 1 25 mg l 1 d 1 respectively using the data of 0 5 hrt which also suggests that r2 possessed a better 4 cp removal capacity than r1 more detailed time course phenol and 4 cp degradation profiles of r1 and r2 were also determined in the last run of each stage figs s4a 4d in most cases phenol and 4 cp were removed in the first half of a hrt and the removal rates in r2 were faster than the corresponding rates in r1 the mn ii concentration and corresponding removal rates were determined twice in each hrt to distinguish the mn ii production and oxidation process adding 4 cp can definitely inhibit mn ii oxidation at stage 3 day 91 136 as illustrated by the mn ii concentration at t1 by lowering the phenol concentration and intermittently adding mn ii the mn ii oxidation began to recover however adding ni ii at stage 7 inhibited mn ii oxidation again fig 2e in the early phase of each hrt t1 the mn ii concentrations were generally high and corresponded to negative mn ii removal rates as high as 0 29 mg l 1 d 1 corresponding to the consumption of biomnox at the end of each hrt mn ii can be re oxidized to biomnox through mnob fig 2f the time course curve for the mn ii removal rates for the last run of each stage showed more detailed information regarding this process for the first four stages the highest values of the mn ii concentrations appeared within 24 h and then began to gradually decrease to below the detection limit for stage 5 and stage 6 the maximum mn ii concentrations appeared at 6 h and then were quickly removed completely at 12 h the mn ii in stage 7 as mentioned above was generally not removed fig s5 the manganese oxides were often produced during nutrient limited condition for pure cultured mnob furgal et al 2014 hence the initial long hrt 72 h enabled gradual consumption of the carbon source thus creating low nutrient conditions in the late phase of one hrt such as 36 h 72 h and promoting the production of manganese oxides in the mbbr this implication is supported by figs s4 and s5 showing that rapid mn ii removal happens only after the phenol and 4 cp are degraded after further acclimation the phenol and 4 cp degraded more quickly thus the mnob is continuously enriched even with a shorter hrt 48 h and 24 h for in situ formed biomnox the source of mn ii is important some wastewater has a suitable concentration of mn ii which may be utilized by mnob to form biomnox katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 zhang et al 2013 a mn cycling biosystem has been constructed for continuous degradation of ciprofloxacin using pseudomonas putida mnb 1 and its generated biomnox zhou et al 2018b it was not necessary to add extra mn ii because the mn ii released after ciprofloxacin reaction is quickly re oxidized to mnox by mnob for our case the existence of high concentrations 4 cp consumes the biomnox resulting in mn ii release in the middle phase of hrt fig 2e and fig s4 however the mnob in mbbr can re oxidize the mn ii into biomnox within a hrt alternatively extra mn ii can be added at a specific time interval to replenish the biomnox that suffers high concentration of pollutants or losses in the effluent for this condition the mn ii in the effluent should be carefully measured to prevent secondary pollution caused by mn ii one possible drawback for phenolic removal using in situ biomnox is the inhibitor of mnob for example for the final stage of our mbbr the co removal of phenolic mn ii and ni ii failed a possible reason is that ni ii has great toxicity to mnob enriched in mbbrs however the mnob could be enriched again after adaptation for ni ii induced stress and then re oxidize mn ii in a reasonable rate data not shown meanwhile adding ni ii did not inhibit mnob activity in a downflow hanging sponge reactor indicating that the toxicity of ni ii is species dependent matsushita et al 2018 hence the toxicity of ni ii may be reduced by adding pre adapted ni ii resistant mnob 3 3 bacterial community succession during long term operation during the long term operation in mbbr the bacterial community successions in r1 and r2 were analyzed through illumina hi seq sequencing of 16s rrna genes the diversity indexes e g chao1 observed species ace shannon simpson and good s coverage are shown in table s2 the good s coverage for all samples was 0 999 suggesting that the sequencing depth reflected the entire bacterial community r1 sta2 and r2 sta5 had the lowest microbial richness evaluated by chao 1 and ace and diversity evaluated by shannon and simpson index the relative abundances 1 of bacteria in each reactor at different stages were analyzed at the phylum and genus levels fig 3 at the phylum level proteobacteria accounts for more than 50 of the bacterial community for all phases followed by bacterioidetes fig 3a at the genus level significant abundance changes of specific genera can be observed in both r1 and r2 fig 3b for r1 the most dominant genera at stage 0 includes zoogloea cupriavidus and ferruginibacter the abundance of these three genera fluctuated during various phases but were most inhibited when suffering 800 mg l 1 of phenol at day 45 stage 1 for r2 the succession of the bacterial communities was more significant the dominant genera in stage 0 were dokdonella sphingomonas and spirosoma after simultaneously adding mn ii and phenol the abundance of comomonas increased to 33 of the whole bacterial community stage 1 then zoogloea became the dominant genus at sta2 with the addition of 4 cp cloacibacterium and pseudomonas accounted for more than 73 of the bacterial community stage 5 after shortening the hrt and adding ni ii the dominant genera became dokdonella cupriavidus and spirosoma stage 6 and stage 7 considering the relative abundances of genera during different phases and reactors some genera enriched at specific phases were further identified in addition to those mentioned above fig 3c for instance devosia bauldia pseudoxanthomonas and unidentified rhizobiales were highly enriched in r2 at stage 4 but their relative abundances decreased quickly when the 4 cp concentration were raised to 20 and 30 mg l 1 unidentified rhizobiaceae fibrisoma unidentified planctomycetales and acinetobacter had the highest abundances in r1 at stage 6 from the bacterial community analysis the abundances of comamonas zoogloea cloacibacterium pseudomonas cupriavidus dokdonella roseomonas tahibacter and spirosoma increased significantly at specific phases of r2 among these genera pseudomonas cupriavidus and spirosoma have been reported as mnob caspi et al 1998 yang et al 2013 the other genera be related to mn ii and ni ii resistance or to high concentrations of 4 cp degradation staniland et al 2010 hassan et al 2018 after identifying the predominant genera in each phase and reactor functional annotation was performed by picrust fig 4 phenol and 4 cp can both be degraded through ortho and meta cleavage pathways while 4 cp is usually channeled into the central metabolism by ortho cleavage pathways ferraroni et al 2006 notably all of the genes involved in the ortho path i and meta cleavage pathways path ii were identified in the predicted metagenomes except for a branch in path ii dmpd which encoded a hydrolase converting 2 hydroxy muconatesemialdehyde to 2 oxopent 4 enoate directly in the first hydroxylation procedure genes encoding 2 4 dichlorophenol 6 monooxygense and pentachlorophenol monooxygenase were also identified in addition to phenol 2 monoxygenase the predicted gene copies of 2 4 dichlorophenol 6 monooxygense were generally stable during the first five stages but increased at r2 sta6 to nearly 10 folds over the levels for r2 sta5 the cluster analysis also showed that r2 sta5 is most distinct relative to the other samples mainly because the decreases in the gene copies involved path ii as the key enzymes in path i and path ii the catechol 1 2 dioxygenase c12o and catechol 2 3 dioxygenase c23o activities of r1 and r2 were determined the enzymatic assays of c12o and c23o demonstrated that only c12o activity could be seen in both r1 and r2 with a specific activity in the range of 0 069 0 127 u mg 1 table s1 these results suggest that microbes mainly employ ortho cleavage pathways to degrade phenol and 4 cp on the other hand the putative genes involving mn ii oxidation including the blue copper oxidases and nadh oxidases are generally in low abundances less than 300 copies for all samples a possible explanation is the lower abundance of mnob and poor annotation on mn ii oxidases 3 4 isolation of functional bacteria from r2 to identify the possible role of microbes for the existence of biomnox a phenol and 4 cp degradation bacterium designated as bwz 1 was isolated from r2 according to the 16s rrna sequencing this bacterium has the highest sequence identity to acinetobacter lwoffii 99 65 and following by acinetobacter harbinensis 98 this bacterium can grow using phenol 4 cp or their mixture as carbon source and can tolerate 100 mg l 1 mn ii in the presence of 100 mg l 1 phenol and 10 mg l 1 4 cp fig s6a the effect of mn ii on the 4 cp and phenol degradation capacities of strain bwz 1 were also examined fig 5 adding 2 5 10 mg l 1 of mn ii promoted the degradation rates of phenol and 4 cp at different levels except that 10 mg l 1 of mn ii lowered the 4 cp degradation rate from 100 to 80 within 96 h this strain did not show any mn ii oxidation capacity even after the 4 cp and phenol had completely degraded fig s6b on the other hand although several common media and the synthetic phenol wastewater were tested isolating mnob from r2 was unsuccessful to the best of our knowledge there are no reports that mnob can utilize phenol as its sole carbon source our attempts to isolate mnob from mbbr using phenol as the sole carbon source also failed hence the mnob in mbbr may utilize the metabolic products of other heterotrophs to support their growth 3 5 characterization of in situ generated biomnox to understand the catalytic performance of in situ formed biomnox the characteristics of partly purified biomnox were investigated and compared with the pristine one the partly purified biomnox exhibited irregular sheet like structures according to the sem image fig 6 a the tem images further confirmed the existence of sheet like structure and the presence of an unexpected nanoscale spherical structure fig 6b and c xrd patterns showed that pristine and partly purified biomnox were both amorphous particles fig 6d xps was further used to identify the valence of the manganese species the mn2p spectra could only be observed in partly purified biomnox possibly due to the interference of biomolecules coated on the surfaces of pristine biomnox fig 6e the mn2p 3 2 spectra were fitted by three peaks which were centered at 642 4 641 5 and 640 3 ev these peaks were assigned to mn iv mn iii and mn ii with atomic proportions of 54 16 and 30 respectively fig 6f although mn iii production was not mentioned at the reactor scale a mnob mesorhizobium australicum t g1 has been reported to form mn iii through an enzymatic reaction bohu et al 2015 herein we presume that mn iii was derived from the incomplete bio oxidation of mn ii and the mn ii may have come from the surface adsorption in biomnox 3 6 batch experiments of biomnox and phenolic substrates to analyze the role of biomolecules and manganese oxides in biomnox batch experiments using pristine and partly purified biomnox were conducted using phenol or 4 cp as the substrate for the pristine biomnox the bacteria and extracellular enzymes coating the surface of mnox were only partly deactivated it was observed that biomnox could remove phenol within 24 h adding nan3 caused only 20 of the phenol to be removed while adding ascorbic acid aa did not affect the phenol degradation when using partly purified biomnox the phenol was not removed at all chemogenic mnox can remove 70 of phenol at 24 h but the removal rate decreased to 30 at 72 h fig 7 a however for 4 cp both biomnox and chemogenic mnox removed it completely within 24 h after adding nan3 or aa the degradation ratios within 72 h decreased by approximately 20 30 fig 7b the partly purified biomnox also completely removed 4 cp within 24 h interestingly when treating 4 cp using partly purified biomnox a significant yellow product was observed within 5 min while no color change was observed in the system containing chemogenic mnox even after 12 h the uv vis spectrum showed in fig 7c exhibited a peak with a maximum absorption peak at 380 nm indicating the existence of 5 chloro 2 hydroxy muconic acid semialdehyde mesdaghinia et al 2017 from the result of lc hrms four other products from the reaction of partly purified biomnox and 4 cp were identified fig s7 the main product was 4 chlorocatechol and trace amount of hydroquinone 1 2 4 trihydroxybenzene and maleic acid could also be detected fig 7d recently the effects of nanomaterials on microbes have attracted great interests due to the inevitable release of various nanomaterials into the environment the effects of artificial nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes graphene oxides silver nanoparticles and chemogenic mno2 have been investigated in pure cultures and at the community level zhang et al 2013 qu et al 2018 moore et al 2016 tian et al 2019 both beneficial and harmful effects on bacterial growth physiological characterization and function have been reported however the effects of in situ formed nanoparticles on microbial communities are rarely reported the aim of this work is to explore the possible synergy of biomnox and the microbial community on phenolic degradation according to the results mbbr r2 exhibited better phenol and 4 cp removal performance than r1 but the putative reason for the accelerated removal was different from the batch experiments the phenol degradation capacity of pristine biomnox is contributed by active bacteria and by extracellular enzymes coating the surfaces of mnox which is supported by nan3 inhibition and the negligible effect of aa the partly purified biomnox did not show a significant degradation capacity for phenol which was in accordance with the phenol removal using α mno2 wang et al 2015 these results implied that mnox itself is not responsible for phenol degradation however our results for the phenol and 4 cp degrading bacteria acinetobacter sp bwz 1 clearly proved that mn ii could accelerate the phenol degradation meanwhile commercial mno2 has been proven to promote methane yields by stimulating the activity of the coenzyme f420 electron transport system and by increasing the relative abundances of specific methanogenic archaea tian et al 2017 therefore mn ii and biomnox may affect phenol degradation through shaping the microbial community and affect enzymatic activity for 4 cp in situ formed biomnox could remove 10 mg l 1 4 cp within 24 h the identified products including 4 cholorcatechol hydroquinone 1 2 4 trihydroxybenezene and maleic acid are the same as those identified in chemical mnox mediated 4 cp oxidation hu et al 2017 however 5 chloro 2 hydroxy muconic acid semialdehyde was also found in the products which is only found in extradiol dioxygenase catalyzed 4 cp degradation bae et al 1996 the only abiotic reaction observed having a similar yellow product is the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp by na3vo2b6o11 fan et al 2015 hence we presumed that biomnox exhibits c23o like enzymatic activity as the biomolecules coated on the surfaces of biomnox have been inactivated by naocl treatment the c23o like activity could not be caused by microbes moreover c23o activity was also not detected by an enzymatic activity assay of the biofilm which further supports the idea that the c23o like activity was from biomnox itself therefore biomnox provided an alternative meta cleavage pathway for 4 cp degradation which is in parallel with the ortho cleavage pathway employed by microbes this inference can also be supported by the observation of yellow degradation products in r2 at stage 4 to stage 7 but not appeared in r1 the other products identified in the batch experiments of biomnox and 4 cp were also found in r2 except maleic acid fig s8 this phenomenon provides a deep insight into the interactions between nanomaterials and microbes at the pure culture level quantum dots cds has been assembled with non phototrophic bacteria to facilitate phototrophic respiration sakimoto et al 2016 at the community level the composition and or function of a microbial community can be affected through the different response of microbes towards nanomaterials however our case indicated a new role for nanomaterials to provide an alternative degradation pathway of pollutants through its enzymatic like activity which may accelerate the degradation of specific pollutants and increase the robustness of the overall community 4 conclusions in this study coupling the oxidation capacities of in situ formed biomnox and a microbial community for phenolic wastewater was attempted mnob was successfully enriched in the rich nutrient conditions in a batch mode of mbbrs with long hrts 72 h biomnox could accelerate phenol degradation by shifting the microbial community meanwhile 4 cp removal can be enhanced by biomnox through its c23o like activity which was complementary with the c12o activities from microbes exhibited at the reactor level overall we provided a successful mnob enrichment strategy for high organic load conditions using mbbrs with long hrts and found a novel c23o like activity of biomnox the degradation pathway complementarity between nanomaterials and the microbial community seems to be an interesting phenomenon which should be further investigated from the perspectives of microbial

after 90 days of operation then 4 chlorophenol 4 cp was added to the mbbr to simulate mixed phenolic wastewater comparing the mbbr r1 without feeding mn ii and the mbbr with biomnox r2 production r2 exhibited robust phenol and 4 cp removal performance 16s rrna gene sequencing was employed to determine the microbial community subsequently a batch experiment demonstrated that partly purified biomnox does not exhibits a capacity for phenol removal but can efficiently remove 4 cp interestingly 5 chloro 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde was found in the products of 4 cp degradation which was the unique product of 4 cp degradation by catechol 2 3 dioxygenase c23o in both reactors only catechol 1 2 dioxygenase c12o activity from microbes can be detected indicating that the existence of biomnox provide an alternative pathway in addition to microbe driven 4 cp degradation overall mbbr based mnob enrichment under high phenol concentration was achieved and 4 cp phenol removal can be accelerated by in situ formed biomnox considering the c23o like activity of biomnox our results suggest a new coupling strategy that involves nanomaterials and a microbial consortium graphical abstract image 1 keywords phenol 4 chlorophenol microbial community biogenic manganese oxides moving bed biofilm reactor 1 introduction manganese oxides mnox x between 1 and 2 are one of the strongest oxidants naturally found in aquatic and terrestrial environment learman et al 2011 the redox potentials of various mnox are usually between 500 and 600 mv and thus these compounds can oxidize a wide range of organic compounds including anti inflammatory drugs and steroidal hormones furgal et al 2014 meanwhile when mnox is present at the nanoscale the high surface area and polymorphic structures makes them powerful sorbents for metal ions e g pb ii ni ii co ii cu ii and zn ii zhou et al 2015 for acidic and neutral ph levels most of the mnox is generated by microbes because chemical mn ii oxidation for these conditions is thermodynamically unfavourable tebo et al 2004 until now diverse mn ii oxidation bacteria mnob have been isolated and used to produce biogenic manganese oxides biomnox under mild condition tebo et al 2005 compared with chemogenic mnox biomnox is usually weakly crystallized and has more mn iv vacancies and larger surface areas these characteristics cause biomnox to possess a higher activity for the oxidation of organic pollutants forrez et al 2010 although identified mnob are phylogenetically diverse all of them are obligate heterotrophs hansel 2017 however cultivation of mnob in an open system is difficult due to the competition with those fast growing heterotrophs previous work has used the low concentrations of organic carbon excreted by autotrophic nitrifiers and methane oxidizing bacteria to support the growth of mnob matsushita et al 2018 cao et al 2015 nevertheless this strategy is not suitable for industrial wastewater with high cod for instance phenolic compounds such as phenol and chlorophenols are regarded as priority hazardous organic pollutants high concentration of phenol 2 8 10 000 mg l 1 can be found in wastewater from petroleum refining coal processing and resin production ren et al 2018 during the chlorination treatment process of wastewater containing phenol 4 chlorophenol 4 cp can form and possess a higher toxicity even at relatively low concentrations carucci et al 2010 on the other hand ni ii and phenol are often encountered together in wastewater from the steel metal plating and painting industries aksu and akpinar 2000 the toxicity of ni ii to microbes is often hinders biological treatment considering the priority of eliminating phenolic in wastewater the excellent reactivity and absorption capacity of mno2 towards phenolic compounds and heavy metals phenolic wastewater is a good candidate for investigating the possibility of mnob enrichment under high cod conditions and the potential coupling between chemical oxidation biomnox and biodegradation a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr relies on biofilms that attach to the surfaces of small plastic carriers which are suspended and mixed in a reactor casas et al 2015 this configuration guarantees the enrichment of slow growing bacteria such as nitrifiers in the carrier making it attractive for enhancing nitrification young et al 2017 hence it is reasonable to attempt to enrich the mnob in a mbbr to avoid competitive weakness with the other heterotrophs meanwhile there were also successful examples that used mbbr to remove organic pollutants zhou et al 2018a tang et al 2017 ooi et al 2017 therefore mbbr is an ideal configuration to explore the coupling effects of biomnox and bacterial community for pollutant removal accordingly a mbbr based mnob enrichment strategy was presumed to support the simultaneous growth of phenolic degrading bacteria and mnob the aims of this study were 1 to facilitate mnob enrichment in a mbbr under high phenol concentration 2 to compare the long term phenol and 4 cp removal performance between mbbrs with and without biomnox and 3 to decipher the role of biomnox in shaping a bacterial consortium and for phenolic removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals agents and synthetic wastewater catechol phenol 4 cp mncl2 and nicl2 were purchased from sinochem co ltd the chemogenic δ mno2 birnessite was obtained according to a previous report liu et al 2018 synthetic phenolic wastewater consisted of the following compounds according to a previous work with the addition of approximate amount of 4 cp

were used without further purification 2 2 reactor setup and operation a pair of mbbrs 2 l laboratory scale plexiglass reactor were used in this study with a sequencing batch mode r1 was the control reactor without feeding mn ii while r2 was used to enrich mnob phenol adapted biofilm coated carriers anoxkaldnes k1 7 mm 9 mm were obtained from a mbbr operated to treat simulated ph shocked phenol wastewater and the filling ratios were 30 for both r1 and r2 zhou et al 2018a an air pump coupled with a porous stone diffuser was used to ensure high aeration in the reactors and the dissolved oxygen content was maintained at 4 5 mg l 1 for the adaptive phase only phenol was fed as the sole carbon source for the treatment of simulated phenolic wastewater various concentrations of 4 cp were added after the adaptive phase mn ii was added to r2 to enrich mnob and to produce biomnox in situ ni ii was added to both mbbrs in the last phase due to its frequent co existence with phenol in various types of wastewater and it may exhibit an interaction with microbes and with biomnox the details of the influent phenol mn ii ni ii and 4 cp concentrations along with the hydraulic retention time hrt are listed in table 1 2 3 characterization of biomnox for characterization in situ formed biogenic manganese oxides were either directly collected or partly purified for the former case 5 randomly selected carriers were sonicated in 50 ml ultrapure water for 0 5 h to cause the biofilms to fall off and the solids were collected by centrifuging at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the pellets were then freeze dried the lyophilized powder was ground for further characterization and batch experiments to obtain partly purified biomnox procedures modified from a previous work were used jiang et al 2010 briefly 5 mg biomnox was first treated in a 10 ml mixture of methanol chloroform h2o 12 5 3 v v with 30 min of sonication this procedure was to extract cell materials with mnox then the supernatant was discarded and the precipitates were washed three times with double distilled water ddw the absorbed mn ii in the precipitates was eliminated by adding 0 1 m hcl into ddw to a final ph of 3 0 the precipitates were then further treated with 0 17 w v naocl in a shaking bath 150 rpm 4 h to remove the remaining solid organic matters finally the product was rinsed 3 times with ddw and was dried in vacuum overnight 70 c for further use the as synthesized and partly purified products were characterized by environmental scanning electron microscopy esem scanning electron microscopy sem

oxidation performance batch experiments were performed to evaluate the oxidation capacity of biomnox towards phenol and 4 cp briefly 20 ml phenol or 4 cp solution was adjusted to ph 7 0 and the final concentration of phenol and 4 cp were 100 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 respectively nacl 20 mm was added to the same solution to guarantee the similar ion strength the reaction with phenol or 4 cp was initiated by adding 5 mg pristine biomnox several control experiments were performed simultaneously including chemically synthesized δ mno2 10 mm nan3 treated biomnox to inhibit the microbial activity

mettler toledo switzerland was used to determine the ph values mn ii and ni ii concentration were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry techcomp aa6100 china the influent effluent samples and supernatant from the batch experiments were filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane and acidified with 1 of concentrated hno3 the limit of detection for mn ii and ni ii were both 0 05 mg l 1 the formation of manganese oxides was qualitatively determined using a leucoberbelin blue lbb assay learman et al 2011 phenol and 4 cp concentrations were analyzed using an agilent 1290 infinity ii ultra

phenol 4 cp and mn ii concentrations were determined twice within a hrt since stage 3 the sampling time for phenol and 4 cp were 36 h and 72 h for day 90 214 24 h and 48 h for days 214 224 and 12 h and 24 h for days 224 238 for mn ii the sampling times were 24 h and 72 h for days 45 181 12 h and 72 h for days 181 214 and 12 h and 24 h for days 214 238 2 6 microbial community analysis biofilm

stage biofilms coated on five randomly chosen carriers were detached and were filtered through 0 45 μm filter paper the following genomic dna extraction pcr and sequencing procedures are the same as discussed in our previous report zhou et al 2018a high throughput sequencing was conducted on an illumina hiseq2500 platform novogene beijing china for bioinformatics analysis quality filtering on the

for all of the figures the stages are abbreviated as sta for brevity e g sta1 sta2 and so on 3 results and discussion 3 1 phenol and mn ii removal performance in mbbr in our previous work mbbr was been used to facilitate the treatment of phenol wastewater zhou et al 2018a hence the phenol adapted microbial consortium was used as the initial inoculums as the biomnox production and accumulation usually need relatively long times up to several days in pure cultures the hrt was first set to 72 h for stage 1 days 0 45 the phenol removal ratios reached approximately 90 for both reactors while no significant blackish colour appeared in r2 during this period and no mn ii removal could be detected for stage 2 day 45 90 the biofilm coatings on the carriers of r2 became brownish and the lbb assay confirmed the formation of biomnox fig s1 as shown in fig 1 a the proportions of phenol removal for r1 and r2 were generally approximately 90 but the phenol removal rate of r2 had larger fluctuation 3 58 5 06 mg l 1 d 1 than r1 3 91 4 88 mg l 1 d 1 these fluctuation may have been caused by the toxicity of mn ii to phenol degrading bacteria fig 1b shows the mn ii removal performance in r2 it could be observed that within each hrt the mn ii removal rates at 24 h were generally negative while these rates became positive at 72 h a negative mn ii removal rate means regeneration of mn ii has occurred which may be due to the release of mn ii release from cell lysis bacteria mediated mn iv reduction and possible reactions between phenol and biomnox for the last 4 cycles day 77 90 the final mn ii concentrations in the effluent were all below 0 5 mg l 1 and the mn ii removal rate remained near 0 014 0 017 mg l 1 d 1 as the ph in r2 stayed around 7 0 data not shown the contribution of chemical mn ii oxidation can be omitted due to the high redox potential 0 6 v required matsushita et al 2018 hence enrichment of mnob in r2 was successful the esem images further showed the difference of the biofilms in r1 and r2 the surfaces of the carriers in r1 were dominated by cocci while the biofilms in r2 consisted mainly of rod shaped bacteria figs s2a and b moreover many nanoscale particles were observed on the biofilm of r2 to further confirm the composition of these nanoparticles hrtem and edx were employed fig s2c shows typical sheet like nanomaterials and the results of edx implied that the nanomaterials contained mn and fe indicating that the products were mixtures of mn and fe oxides with an mn fe atomic ratio of 1 20 fig s3 a more precise mn fe atomic ratio was calculated through the result of icp ms and was approximately 1 4 4 34 mn and 15 78 fe for pristine biogenic biomnox the source of fe oxides can be biogenic or chemogenic which have been reported to form fe mn oxides bai et al 2016 peng et al 2015 3 2 long term operational performance of mbbrs after enrichment for both phenol degrading bacteria and mnob the reactors r1 and r2 were operated for an additional 148 days under various conditions day 91 238 as the hrt was chosen to facilitate the mn ii oxidation which was usually slower than the phenol and 4 cp degradation the phenol 4 cp and mn ii concentrations and corresponding removal rate were also determined at specific time intervals in each hrt generally r2 possessed higher phenol removal rate and robust performance when suffering shocking conditions during days 91 112 the residual phenol concentration of r2 at 36 h 0 5 hrt had gradually decreased from 600 to 0 mg l 1 and remained at 0 mg l 1 until day 181 after increasing the 4 cp concentration day 181 214 shortening the hrt days 214 233 or adding ni ii days 234 238 the phenol concentrations for both reactors at 0 5 hrt began to fluctuate while the residual phenol concentrations in r2 were still lower than those in r1 fig 2 a at the end of each hrt the phenol concentrations in the r2 effluent were generally undetectable after day 100 while the corresponding phenol concentrations in r1 the effluent could be measured at days 180 212 and at day 234 238 the differences in phenol degradation in r1 and r2 were major when compared to the phenol removal rates at 0 5 hrt rate 1 than the whole hrt rate 2 because most of the phenol was degraded at the first half of the hrt fig 2b the maximum phenol removal rates for r1 and r2 were 15 3 and 22 18 mg l 1 d 1 respectively using the data of 0 5 hrt which suggested that r2 had better phenol removal performance than r1 for 4 cp both reactors exhibited nearly completely removal at day 90 180 when increasing 4 cp concentration and shortening the hrt r2 showed a more robust removal performance for 4 cp than r1 and still completely remove 4 cp after day 210 for r1 the effluent 4 cp concentrations fluctuated between 0 and 9 8 mg l 1 fig 2c similar to the phenol degradation the differences in 4 cp removal rates between r1 and r2 were large at 0 5 hrt especially after 200 days fig 2d the maximum 4 cp removal rates for r1 and r2 were 0 82 and 1 25 mg l 1 d 1 respectively using the data of 0 5 hrt which also suggests that r2 possessed a better 4 cp removal capacity than r1 more detailed time course phenol and 4 cp degradation profiles of r1 and r2 were also determined in the last run of each stage figs s4a 4d in most cases phenol and 4 cp were removed in the first half of a hrt and the removal rates in r2 were faster than the corresponding rates in r1 the mn ii concentration and corresponding removal rates were determined twice in each hrt to distinguish the mn ii production and oxidation process adding 4 cp can definitely inhibit mn ii oxidation at stage 3 day 91 136 as illustrated by the mn ii concentration at t1 by lowering the phenol concentration and intermittently adding mn ii the mn ii oxidation began to recover however adding ni ii at stage 7 inhibited mn ii oxidation again fig 2e in the early phase of each hrt t1 the mn ii concentrations were generally high and corresponded to negative mn ii removal rates as high as 0 29 mg l 1 d 1 corresponding to the consumption of biomnox at the end of each hrt mn ii can be re oxidized to biomnox through mnob fig 2f the time course curve for the mn ii removal rates for the last run of each stage showed more detailed information regarding this process for the first four stages the highest values of the mn ii concentrations appeared within 24 h and then began to gradually decrease to below the detection limit for stage 5 and stage 6 the maximum mn ii concentrations appeared at 6 h and then were quickly removed completely at 12 h the mn ii in stage 7 as mentioned above was generally not removed fig s5 the manganese oxides were often produced during nutrient limited condition for pure cultured mnob furgal et al 2014 hence the initial long hrt 72 h enabled gradual consumption of the carbon source thus creating low nutrient conditions in the late phase of one hrt such as 36 h 72 h and promoting the production of manganese oxides in the mbbr this implication is supported by figs s4 and s5 showing that rapid mn ii removal happens only after the phenol and 4 cp are degraded after further acclimation the phenol and 4 cp degraded more quickly thus the mnob is continuously enriched even with a shorter hrt 48 h and 24 h for in situ formed biomnox the source of mn ii is important some wastewater has a suitable concentration of mn ii which may be utilized by mnob to form biomnox katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 zhang et al 2013 a mn cycling biosystem has been constructed for continuous degradation of ciprofloxacin using pseudomonas putida mnb 1 and its generated biomnox zhou et al 2018b it was not necessary to add extra mn ii because the mn ii released after ciprofloxacin reaction is quickly re oxidized to mnox by mnob for our case the existence of high concentrations 4 cp consumes the biomnox resulting in mn ii release in the middle phase of hrt fig 2e and fig s4 however the mnob in mbbr can re oxidize the mn ii into biomnox within a hrt alternatively extra mn ii can be added at a specific time interval to replenish the biomnox that suffers high concentration of pollutants or losses in the effluent for this condition the mn ii in the effluent should be carefully measured to prevent secondary pollution caused by mn ii one possible drawback for phenolic removal using in situ biomnox is the inhibitor of mnob for example for the final stage of our mbbr the co removal of phenolic mn ii and ni ii failed a possible reason is that ni ii has great toxicity to mnob enriched in mbbrs however the mnob could be enriched again after adaptation for ni ii induced stress and then re oxidize mn ii in a reasonable rate data not shown meanwhile adding ni ii did not inhibit mnob activity in a downflow hanging sponge reactor indicating that the toxicity of ni ii is species dependent matsushita et al 2018 hence the toxicity of ni ii may be reduced by adding pre adapted ni ii resistant mnob 3 3 bacterial community succession during long term operation during the long term operation in mbbr the bacterial community successions in r1 and r2 were analyzed through illumina hi seq sequencing of 16s rrna genes the diversity indexes e g chao1 observed species ace shannon simpson and good s coverage are shown in table s2 the good s coverage for all samples was 0 999 suggesting that the sequencing depth reflected the entire bacterial community r1 sta2 and r2 sta5 had the lowest microbial richness evaluated by chao 1 and ace and diversity evaluated by shannon and simpson index the relative abundances 1 of bacteria in each reactor at different stages were analyzed at the phylum and genus levels fig 3 at the phylum level proteobacteria accounts for more than 50 of the bacterial community for all phases followed by bacterioidetes fig 3a at the genus level significant abundance changes of specific genera can be observed in both r1 and r2 fig 3b for r1 the most dominant genera at stage 0 includes zoogloea cupriavidus and ferruginibacter the abundance of these three genera fluctuated during various phases but were most inhibited when suffering 800 mg l 1 of phenol at day 45 stage 1 for r2 the succession of the bacterial communities was more significant the dominant genera in stage 0 were dokdonella sphingomonas and spirosoma after simultaneously adding mn ii and phenol the abundance of comomonas increased to 33 of the whole bacterial community stage 1 then zoogloea became the dominant genus at sta2 with the addition of 4 cp cloacibacterium and pseudomonas accounted for more than 73 of the bacterial community stage 5 after shortening the hrt and adding ni ii the dominant genera became dokdonella cupriavidus and spirosoma stage 6 and stage 7 considering the relative abundances of genera during different phases and reactors some genera enriched at specific phases were further identified in addition to those mentioned above fig 3c for instance devosia bauldia pseudoxanthomonas and unidentified rhizobiales were highly enriched in r2 at stage 4 but their relative abundances decreased quickly when the 4 cp concentration were raised to 20 and 30 mg l 1 unidentified rhizobiaceae fibrisoma unidentified planctomycetales and acinetobacter had the highest abundances in r1 at stage 6 from the bacterial community analysis the abundances of comamonas zoogloea cloacibacterium pseudomonas cupriavidus dokdonella roseomonas tahibacter and spirosoma increased significantly at specific phases of r2 among these genera pseudomonas cupriavidus and spirosoma have been reported as mnob caspi et al 1998 yang et al 2013 the other genera be related to mn ii and ni ii resistance or to high concentrations of 4 cp degradation staniland et al 2010 hassan et al 2018 after identifying the predominant genera in each phase and reactor functional annotation was performed by picrust fig 4 phenol and 4 cp can both be degraded through ortho and meta cleavage pathways while 4 cp is usually channeled into the central metabolism by ortho cleavage pathways ferraroni et al 2006 notably all of the genes involved in the ortho path i and meta cleavage pathways path ii were identified in the predicted metagenomes except for a branch in path ii dmpd which encoded a hydrolase converting 2 hydroxy muconatesemialdehyde to 2 oxopent 4 enoate directly in the first hydroxylation procedure genes encoding 2 4 dichlorophenol 6 monooxygense and pentachlorophenol monooxygenase were also identified in addition to phenol 2 monoxygenase the predicted gene copies of 2 4 dichlorophenol 6 monooxygense were generally stable during the first five stages but increased at r2 sta6 to nearly 10 folds over the levels for r2 sta5 the cluster analysis also showed that r2 sta5 is most distinct relative to the other samples mainly because the decreases in the gene copies involved path ii as the key enzymes in path i and path ii the catechol 1 2 dioxygenase c12o and catechol 2 3 dioxygenase c23o activities of r1 and r2 were determined the enzymatic assays of c12o and c23o demonstrated that only c12o activity could be seen in both r1 and r2 with a specific activity in the range of 0 069 0 127 u mg 1 table s1 these results suggest that microbes mainly employ ortho cleavage pathways to degrade phenol and 4 cp on the other hand the putative genes involving mn ii oxidation including the blue copper oxidases and nadh oxidases are generally in low abundances less than 300 copies for all samples a possible explanation is the lower abundance of mnob and poor annotation on mn ii oxidases 3 4 isolation of functional bacteria from r2 to identify the possible role of microbes for the existence of biomnox a phenol and 4 cp degradation bacterium designated as bwz 1 was isolated from r2 according to the 16s rrna sequencing this bacterium has the highest sequence identity to acinetobacter lwoffii 99 65 and following by acinetobacter harbinensis 98 this bacterium can grow using phenol 4 cp or their mixture as carbon source and can tolerate 100 mg l 1 mn ii in the presence of 100 mg l 1 phenol and 10 mg l 1 4 cp fig s6a the effect of mn ii on the 4 cp and phenol degradation capacities of strain bwz 1 were also examined fig 5 adding 2 5 10 mg l 1 of mn ii promoted the degradation rates of phenol and 4 cp at different levels except that 10 mg l 1 of mn ii lowered the 4 cp degradation rate from 100 to 80 within 96 h this strain did not show any mn ii oxidation capacity even after the 4 cp and phenol had completely degraded fig s6b on the other hand although several common media and the synthetic phenol wastewater were tested isolating mnob from r2 was unsuccessful to the best of our knowledge there are no reports that mnob can utilize phenol as its sole carbon source our attempts to isolate mnob from mbbr using phenol as the sole carbon source also failed hence the mnob in mbbr may utilize the metabolic products of other heterotrophs to support their growth 3 5 characterization of in situ generated biomnox to understand the catalytic performance of in situ formed biomnox the characteristics of partly purified biomnox were investigated and compared with the pristine one the partly purified biomnox exhibited irregular sheet like structures according to the sem image fig 6 a the tem images further confirmed the existence of sheet like structure and the presence of an unexpected nanoscale spherical structure fig 6b and c xrd patterns showed that pristine and partly purified biomnox were both amorphous particles fig 6d xps was further used to identify the valence of the manganese species the mn2p spectra could only be observed in partly purified biomnox possibly due to the interference of biomolecules coated on the surfaces of pristine biomnox fig 6e the mn2p 3 2 spectra were fitted by three peaks which were centered at 642 4 641 5 and 640 3 ev these peaks were assigned to mn iv mn iii and mn ii with atomic proportions of 54 16 and 30 respectively fig 6f although mn iii production was not mentioned at the reactor scale a mnob mesorhizobium australicum t g1 has been reported to form mn iii through an enzymatic reaction bohu et al 2015 herein we presume that mn iii was derived from the incomplete bio oxidation of mn ii and the mn ii may have come from the surface adsorption in biomnox 3 6 batch experiments of biomnox and phenolic substrates to analyze the role of biomolecules and manganese oxides in biomnox batch experiments using pristine and partly purified biomnox were conducted using phenol or 4 cp as the substrate for the pristine biomnox the bacteria and extracellular enzymes coating the surface of mnox were only partly deactivated it was observed that biomnox could remove phenol within 24 h adding nan3 caused only 20 of the phenol to be removed while adding ascorbic acid aa did not affect the phenol degradation when using partly purified biomnox the phenol was not removed at all chemogenic mnox can remove 70 of phenol at 24 h but the removal rate decreased to 30 at 72 h fig 7 a however for 4 cp both biomnox and chemogenic mnox removed it completely within 24 h after adding nan3 or aa the degradation ratios within 72 h decreased by approximately 20 30 fig 7b the partly purified biomnox also completely removed 4 cp within 24 h interestingly when treating 4 cp using partly purified biomnox a significant yellow product was observed within 5 min while no color change was observed in the system containing chemogenic mnox even after 12 h the uv vis spectrum showed in fig 7c exhibited a peak with a maximum absorption peak at 380 nm indicating the existence of 5 chloro 2 hydroxy muconic acid semialdehyde mesdaghinia et al 2017 from the result of lc hrms four other products from the reaction of partly purified biomnox and 4 cp were identified fig s7 the main product was 4 chlorocatechol and trace amount of hydroquinone 1 2 4 trihydroxybenzene and maleic acid could also be detected fig 7d recently the effects of nanomaterials on microbes have attracted great interests due to the inevitable release of various nanomaterials into the environment the effects of artificial nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes graphene oxides silver nanoparticles and chemogenic mno2 have been investigated in pure cultures and at the community level zhang et al 2013 qu et al 2018 moore et al 2016 tian et al 2019 both beneficial and harmful effects on bacterial growth physiological characterization and function have been reported however the effects of in situ formed nanoparticles on microbial communities are rarely reported the aim of this work is to explore the possible synergy of biomnox and the microbial community on phenolic degradation according to the results mbbr r2 exhibited better phenol and 4 cp removal performance than r1 but the putative reason for the accelerated removal was different from the batch experiments the phenol degradation capacity of pristine biomnox is contributed by active bacteria and by extracellular enzymes coating the surfaces of mnox which is supported by nan3 inhibition and the negligible effect of aa the partly purified biomnox did not show a significant degradation capacity for phenol which was in accordance with the phenol removal using α mno2 wang et al 2015 these results implied that mnox itself is not responsible for phenol degradation however our results for the phenol and 4 cp degrading bacteria acinetobacter sp bwz 1 clearly proved that mn ii could accelerate the phenol degradation meanwhile commercial mno2 has been proven to promote methane yields by stimulating the activity of the coenzyme f420 electron transport system and by increasing the relative abundances of specific methanogenic archaea tian et al 2017 therefore mn ii and biomnox may affect phenol degradation through shaping the microbial community and affect enzymatic activity for 4 cp in situ formed biomnox could remove 10 mg l 1 4 cp within 24 h the identified products including 4 cholorcatechol hydroquinone 1 2 4 trihydroxybenezene and maleic acid are the same as those identified in chemical mnox mediated 4 cp oxidation hu et al 2017 however 5 chloro 2 hydroxy muconic acid semialdehyde was also found in the products which is only found in extradiol dioxygenase catalyzed 4 cp degradation bae et al 1996 the only abiotic reaction observed having a similar yellow product is the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp by na3vo2b6o11 fan et al 2015 hence we presumed that biomnox exhibits c23o like enzymatic activity as the biomolecules coated on the surfaces of biomnox have been inactivated by naocl treatment the c23o like activity could not be caused by microbes moreover c23o activity was also not detected by an enzymatic activity assay of the biofilm which further supports the idea that the c23o like activity was from biomnox itself therefore biomnox provided an alternative meta cleavage pathway for 4 cp degradation which is in parallel with the ortho cleavage pathway employed by microbes this inference can also be supported by the observation of yellow degradation products in r2 at stage 4 to stage 7 but not appeared in r1 the other products identified in the batch experiments of biomnox and 4 cp were also found in r2 except maleic acid fig s8 this phenomenon provides a deep insight into the interactions between nanomaterials and microbes at the pure culture level quantum dots cds has been assembled with non phototrophic bacteria to facilitate phototrophic respiration sakimoto et al 2016 at the community level the composition and or function of a microbial community can be affected through the different response of microbes towards nanomaterials however our case indicated a new role for nanomaterials to provide an alternative degradation pathway of pollutants through its enzymatic like activity which may accelerate the degradation of specific pollutants and increase the robustness of the overall community 4 conclusions in this study coupling the oxidation capacities of in situ formed biomnox and a microbial community for phenolic wastewater was attempted mnob was successfully enriched in the rich nutrient conditions in a batch mode of mbbrs with long hrts 72 h biomnox could accelerate phenol degradation by shifting the microbial community meanwhile 4 cp removal can be enhanced by biomnox through its c23o like activity which was complementary with the c12o activities from microbes exhibited at the reactor level overall we provided a successful mnob enrichment strategy for high organic load conditions using mbbrs with long hrts and found a novel c23o like activity of biomnox the degradation pathway complementarity between nanomaterials and the microbial community seems to be an interesting phenomenon which should be further investigated from the perspectives of microbial

18463,shallow lakes are hotspots for carbon processing and important natural sources of methane ch4 emission ebullitive ch4 flux may constitute the overwhelming majority of total ch4 flux but the episodic nature of ebullition events makes determining both quantity and the controlling factors challenging here we used the world s longest running shallow lake mesocosm facility where the experimental treatments are low and high nutrients crossed with three temperatures to investigate the quantity and drivers of ch4 ebullition the mean ch4 ebullition flux in the high nutrient treatment 41 5 52 3 mg ch4 c m 2 d 1 mesocosms was significantly larger than in the low nutrient treatment 3 6 5 4 mg ch4 c m 2 d 1 mesocosms varying with temperature scenarios over eight weeks from june to august covered here warming resulted in a weak but insignificant enhancement of ch4 ebullition we found significant positive relationships between ebullition and chlorophyll a dissolved organic carbon doc biodegradable doc δ2h δ18o and δ13c doc autochthonous dissolved organic matter dom fluorescent components and a fraction of lipids proteins and lignins revealed using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and a negative relationship between ebullitive ch4 flux and the percentage volume inhabited of macrophytes a 24 h laboratory bio incubation experiment performed at room temperature 20 2 c in the dark further revealed a rapid depletion of algal dom concurrent with a massive increased ch4 production whereas soil derived dom had a limited effect on ch4 production we conclude that eutrophication likely induced the loss of macrophytes and increase in algal biomass and the resultant accumulation algal derived bio labile dom potentially drives enhanced outgassing of ebullitive ch4

mass spectrometry greenhouse gases 1 introduction small shallow lakes are the most numerous lake type in the world and are hotspots of carbon processing and represent a large yet poorly defined source of atmospheric methane ch4 emission bogard et al 2014 holgerson and raymond 2016 davidson et al 2018 lake ecosystems have been estimated to contribute 16 24 of the world s ch4 emission ciais et al 2014 saunois et al 2016 samad and bertilsson 2017 despite only covering 4 of the earth s non glaciated surface area verpoorter et al 2015 furthermore approximately 50 of the world s lakes measured by surface area are located in climate sensitive regions and the ch4 emission from these small lakes has been estimated to be equivalent to roughly 60 of the emission from all natural ch4 sources wik et al 2016 recent studies have revealed that nutrient enrichment and warming can interact to control the outgassing of ch4 in particular fueling the ebullition of ch4 delsontro et al 2016 2018a davidson et al 2018 both eutrophication and warming can fuel algal blooms leading to the loss of submerged macrophytes and this potentially leads to enhanced diffusive and ebullitive ch4 emissions while submerged plants have been shown to be a potential sink of ch4 davidson et al 2015 2018 furthermore increased algal biomass can result in an elevated production and accumulation of autochthonous dissolved organic matter dom zhou et al 2015 and this portion of algal dom may impact ch4 production rates west et al 2012 2015 although a recent study have revealed that overall trophic status and macrophyte coverage greatly impact ch4 ebullition from shallow lake mesocosms davidson et al 2018 the relative importance of autochthonous and allochthonous dom i e the carbon substrates on ch4 ebullition as well as the mechanisms underlying dom and ebullitive ch4 remain largely unknown archaeal methanogenesis has long been thought to be the major source of biogenic ch4 thauer et al 2008 and the effects of chlorophyll a chl a a surrogate of algal biomass and bulk dissolved organic carbon doc on ch4 production have been investigated west et al 2012 delsontro et al 2018b a recent study have revealed that eutrophication overrode climate warming in enhancing the chl a levels and thereby the accumulation of autochthonous dom zhou et al 2018a the linkage between this dom fraction and ch4 ebullition is however largely unknown the chemical reactivity and bio lability of dom have long been considered to be largely determined by its source and chemical composition stedmon et al 2007 kowalczuk et al 2013 fu et al 2016 yang et al 2017 to what extent there is a direct linkage between ebullition of ch4 from shallow lakes and dom composition is largely unknown the ch4 flux can be divided into three pathways diffusive plant mediated and ebullitive flux and in shallow and eutrophic lakes the ebullitive flux can contribute up to 95 of the total ch4 emission davidson et al 2018 the ch4 ebullition generally increases with increasing primary productivity delsontro et al 2016 but is highly stochastic bastviken et al 2004 making estimation of the flux a challenging task wik et al 2013 microbes especially archaea fuel the rapid degradation of bio labile dom and can result in oxygen depletion in the water column or lake sediment zhou et al 2015 2018b tang et al 2017 and thereby a further increase in the ebullitive flux borges et al 2015 delsontro et al 2016 davidson et al 2018 dom serves as carbon source for ch4 emission in lake ecosystems and is comprised of a mixture of degradation by products and freshly produced compounds that vary remarkably in molecular weight coble 2007 optical measurements including fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac have been utilised to trace the sources and composition of dom in various aquatic ecosystems murphy et al 2008 hood et al 2009 yao et al 2011 guo et al 2014 hur et al 2014 he and hur 2015 recent studies have applied electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy ft icr ms to facilitate the characterisation of dom in various aquatic ecosystems dittmar and paeng 2009 stubbins et al 2010 spencer et al 2014 hawkes et al 2016 the ultrahigh resolving power and mass measurement accuracy of ft icr ms allow the assignment of molecular formulae to thousands of dom molecules and give considerable advances in obtaining compositional information mopper et al 2007 in productive ecosystems dom derived from the degradation of aquatic organisms contributes importantly to the carbon pool and represents a considerable fraction of the bio labile dom hur et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 huang et al 2018 song et al 2018 microbial cycling of bio labile dom may potentially fuel the outgassing of ch4 zhou et al 2018b to date however to the best of our knowledge there has been no attempt to characterise the direct linkage between dom composition and bio lability and the ebullition of ch4 we combined investigation at a long running mesocosm experiment mimicking shallow lakes with laboratory bio incubation experiments to investigate the impact of dom composition and bioavailability on the ebullition of ch4 ebullition was measured continuously and the percentage volume inhabited pvi of submerged macrophytes and values of chl a doc and optical dom were determined weekly to trace possible drivers of ch4 ebullition we hypothesised that highly bio labile autochthonous dom accumulated in the high nutrient mesocosms may fuel the outgassing of ch4 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experimental facility mimicking shallow lakes located in lemming denmark 56 23 n 9 52 e has run continuously since august 2003 and is the longest running mesocosm experiment in the world aiming to unravel the combined effects of global warming and eutrophication on shallow lakes liboriussen et al 2005 briefly the experiment consists of 24 fully mixed flow through experimental shallow lake mesocosms diameter 1 9 m water depth 1 m water residence time 2 5 months under six different treatments three temperature levels crossed with two nutrient treatments in four replicates the three temperature treatments include unheated ambient mesocosms amb ipcc climate scenario a2 a2 houghton et al 2001 and a2 50 a2 with temperatures 2 3 c and 4 5 c higher than amb respectively depending on season adjusted monthly the monthly temperatures were determined from regional downscaling of the gcm models liboriussen et al 2005 using 1960 1990 as the reference period and the modeled temperatures for 2071 2100 liboriussen et al 2005 the a2 and a2 mesocosms all exhibited seasonal and diurnal water temperature fluctuations following the amb mesocosms liboriussen et al 2005 sediment collected from several natural lakes around lemming denmark was homogenised and added to the mesocosms 10 cm depth prior to the initialisation of the experiment in 2003 and all the mesocosms share identical initial conditions liboriussen et al 2005 the experimental shallow lake mesocosms are all fed by groundwater dissolved inorganic carbon 31 4 3 8 mg l 1 and dissolved organic carbon doc 1 06 0 42 mg l 1 thus representing groundwater fed small shallow lakes the low nutrient experimental mesocosms receive no additional nutrients and total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations were 0 18 mg l 1 and 14 μg l 1 respectively during the experiment the extra loading of tn and tp to the high nutrient experimental mesocosms are 7 mgn m 2 d 1 and 27 1 μgp m 2 d 1 respectively within the mesocosms mean values of 3 17 mg l 1 tn and 417 μg l 1 tp during the experiment were observed for the high nutrient treatment the extra nutrient loading caused a shift from the clear water conditions existing in the low nutrient mesocosms to turbid water in the high nutrient mesocosms there were no floating or emergent plants in the mesocosms and we quantified the submerged plants as pvi in the water column following the approach detailed in reference davidson et al 2018 briefly the coverage percentage and height of the submerged plants were determined and the proportion of the mesocosms covered by submerged plants was correspondingly assessed plant abundance was investigated weekly when gas and dom samples were collected 2 2 ebullitive ch4 sampling and flux calculations the ebullitive flux was determined following the approach detailed in reference davidson et al 2018 briefly specially designed gas traps with two inverted funnels connected with 500 ml glass bottles were placed right below the water surface in each mesocosm the funnels were located 0 2 m below the water surface in the same position in each mesocosm the funnels cover an area of 0 0225 m2 and represent 0 8 of the total area of the mesocosms this is a much larger proportion of the total mesocosm area compared with samples taken in typical natural lakes and the obtained ebullitive flux measurements are thus supposedly more reliable wik et al 2013 davidson et al 2018 samples were collected every week from june to august 2016 8 occasions in total the sample volume was determined and the ch4 gas was collected from the bottle with a syringe 50 ml fitted with a three way stopcock using a specially designed lid equipped with rubber septa the funnels and bottles were cleaned or replaced every week during the experiment the volume of ebullitive bubbles never exceeded 400 ml during the experiment methane concentrations were determined on an innova photoaccoustic gas monitor which is suited to the very high concentrations of ch4 up to 100 000 ppm in the bubbles the results were validated using the results measured on an agilent 7890 gas chromatograph system agilent denmark davidson et al 2018 the ebullitive ch4 flux was calculated using the method detailed in reference davidson et al 2018 1 ebullitive ch4 flux pch4bub volbub t a where pch4bub and volbub are the ch4 concentration and volume of the trapped bubbles respectively t and a are the sampling time interval and the area of the funnel 0 0225 m2 due to the very low solubility of ch4 we assume the effect of re dissolved ch4 during the weekly sampling intervals to be minor davidson et al 2018 2 3 cdom sample collection and bio incubation experiment water samples were collected twice per day at 19 00 and 07 00 the next morning once a week for eight weeks from june to august 2016 from the experimental mesocosms using acid cleaned niskin bottles a total of 387 water samples 24 mesocosms 2 times per day 8 weeks 3 source water groundwater samples were collected and immediately filtered through whatman

is available for microbial uptake and operationally biodegradable doc bdoc is defined as the percentage of doc being mineralized over a certain period of time typically 28 days holmes et al 2008 mann et al 2012 abbott et al 2014 vonk et al 2015 bdoc usually increased logarithmically with increasing incubation time and varies minimally after two weeks of bio incubation spencer et al 2015 dom samples collected in the sixth week of the mesocosm experiment were used for 28 days of bio incubation under room termperature 20 2 c to unveil the bio lability of doc in the mesocosms and how bdoc may influence ch4 ebullition following the methods detailed in zhou et al 2018a and can be found in the supporting information to unravel the potential role of autochthonous algal dom in fuelling the outgassing of ch4 we carried out a 24 h bio incubation experiment for soil dom and algal dom soil dom and algal dom samples were used to simulate the optical properties of dom samples collected from the groundwater fed experimental facilities without and with the addition of external nutrients boosting algal blooms approximately 10 kg organic rich topsoil from the lake taihu watershed and 10 l algae samples enriched using phytoplankton net from lake taihu were collected in the nearshore of meiliang bay lake taihu on 20 september 2018 during a microcystis algal bloom approximately 20 l mill q water was added to the topsoil and the algae samples respectively the mixtures were both shaken at 300 rpm for 30 min and then gently shaken several times a day to keep them oxidised and degraded in the dark at 20 2 c for three days soil leachate and algal water mixture were successively filtered through pre rinsed whatman gf d 2 7 μm porosity and millipore filters 0 22 μm the soil dom and algal dom samples were both diluted to ensure a roughly similar initial doc concentration 15 mg l 1 three aliquots filtered through millipore filters for both soil dom and algal dom determination were immediately 0 h measured for cdom absorption and fluorescence as well as doc concentrations three additional aliquot filtrates for both soil dom and algal dom measurement were poured into 61 ml acid cleaned and pre rinsed brown glass bottles with excess dom sample overflowing the bottles the bottles were then immediately capped without headspace using a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with an aluminium cap n2 gas ultrahigh purity 99 999 was injected into the bottle via two syringes to create a 10 ml headspace following the methods detailed in xiao et al 2017 each vial for bio incubation had the headspace flushed three times with n2 gas for 30 s prior to the incubation the bottles were shaken vigorously for 10 min to allow the dissolved ch4 to get into equilibrium with the headspace an approximately 5 ml gas sample was drawn from the headspace using a syringe with a three way stopcork and injected into a gas chromatograph model agilent gc6890n agilent co ca usa with a flame ionization detector for ch4 detection 2 ml soil and algal leachates filtered through gf d filters 2 7 μm porosity were used as bacterial inoculum and extra nutrients were added following the aforementioned methods for bdoc measurements abbott et al 2014 vonk et al 2015 after 24 h incubation 20 2 c the samples were immediately filtered through millipore filters for doc cdom absorption and fluorescence measurements and headspace bottles filled with soil dom and algal dom samples were immediately measured for dissolved ch4 2 4 cdom optical measurements calibration and parafac modelling

no significant difference was observed in mean ebullitive ch4 flux among the three temperature treatments for the low nutrient group anova fig 1 table s1 elevated nutrient levels have shifted the

reaction pathways of dom molecules in various aquatic environments kim et al 2003 dittmar and paeng 2009 stubbins et al 2010 spencer et al 2014 kellerman et al 2015 we selected samples collected from the amb and a2 temperature scenarios crossed with the two nutrient levels to exhibit how eutrophication and warming may change the molecular signature of dom fig 2 for the amb temperature scenario a decreased relative abundance at molecular weight m z 500 800 was recorded for the dom sample collected from the high relative to the low nutrient treatment fig 2 this resulted in an increased relative abundance of lipids amino acids associated with proteins and lignins and a decreased relative abundance of carbohydrates and unsaturated hydrocarbons for the high relative to the low nutrient treatment fig 2 fig s4 for the a2 scenario in comparison eutrophication decreased the average molecular weight of dom collected from the high relative to the low nutrient treatment resulting in a shifting of the bell like relative intensity distribution centered from around m z 400 to m z 350 fig 2 a notable higher relative abundance of lipids amino acids associated with proteins were found for the high relative to the low nutrient mesocosms fig 2 fig s4 for the amb and a2 scenarios crossed with the two nutrient treatments lipids and amino acids associated with proteins contributed 1530

represent 42 70 of the total formulas assigned and 34 6 71 6 of the total relative abundance of the four dom samples fig s4 tables s2 s3 this constituted the greatest contribution percentages to the total assigned formulas the results being consistent with those of a previous study in the same experimental facility showing that terrestrial humic rich fluorophores contributed significantly to the eems spectrum fig s3 zhou et al 2018a lipids proteins and amino sugars often originate from microbial degradation of algal biomass in aquatic ecosystems while lignin can be categorised as the unique remnants of terrestrial organic rich dom dittmar and paeng 2009 stubbins et al 2010 spencer et al 2014 kellerman et al 2015 in this study cho contributed 2445 4653 peaks accounting for 37 43 of the total formulas assigned and 37 7 45 2 of the total relative abundance to the amb and a2 treatments crossed with low and high nutrients table s4 in comparison chon only and chos only compounds contributed 2544 5284 and 750 2666 peaks or 39 44 and 13 21 of the total assigned formulas corresponding to 30 6 53 0 and 9 2 27 5 of the total relative abundance respectively table s4 a total of 3705 peaks were correlated notably with ch4 ebullition with absolute spearman rank correlation coefficients r 0 4 fig 2 we found the relative abundance of a total of 3031 peaks mostly lipids proteins and lignins were positively correlated to ch4 ebullition while the remaining 674 peaks mostly unsaturated hydrocarbons negatively correlated to ch4 ebullition fig 2 3 4 relationships between macrophyte abundance chl a dom related indices and ebullitive ch4 flux and pca results we found that the ebullitive ch4 flux was significantly negatively related to macrophyte abundance pvi and positively with algal chl a fig 3 the ebullitive ch4 flux was also significantly positively related to doc a 350 bdoc δ13c doc and fmax of all the six parafac components fig 3 notably the r 2 for the linear models between all the six components and the ebullitive ch4 flux for the twenty four mesocosms were higher than 0 4 fig 3 eutrophication increased the concentration of autochthonous dom and lowered the specific heat capacity in the water column of the high nutrient mesocosms which resulted in enriched δ2h and δ18o we found significant positive relationships between surface water δ2h and ebullitive ch4 δ13c doc doc fulvic like c2 microbial humic like c3 and tryptophan like c5 c6 fig s5 the concentration of autochthonous dom was closely linked to the algal blooms induced by nutrient addition we found negative relationships between macrophyte abundance pvi and microbial humic like c3 tyrosine like c4 and tryptophan like c5 c6 fig 4 we further found positive relationships between algal chl a and c3 c6 fig 4 these relationships indicate that degradation of algal chl a rather than macrophytes was the major source of autochthonous bio labile dom in the mesocosms enhanced accumulation of autochthonous bio labile c3 c6 resulted in elevated bdoc of the dom samples fig 4 in one sample collected from low nutrient groups the bdoc value 55 was repeatedly identified as an outlier and this was therefore removed from the subsequent analyses fig 3 fig 4 we further used the calc relimp function based on glm modelling inbuilt in r to unveiling the relative importance of pvi chl a and dom related parameters in fueling ch4 ebullition from the mesocosms 77 of the variability of ch4 ebullition was explained by a total of ten variables including macrophyte abundance pvi chl a doc a 350 parafac derived c1 c6 fig 5 among the ten variables autochthonous bio labile c3 c6 contributed to 46 5 of the variation explained fig 5 microbial humic like c3 and tryptophan like c5 were among the ten variables included in the calc relimp with significance level p 0 01 fig 5 pca can be used to produce a reduced dataset explaining the variation in the majority of variables aiding in the interpretation of the variables with no prior knowledge bro and smilde 2014 in this study we used pca to summarizing the potential drivers of ch4 ebullition and ch4 efflux itself to unravel the potential linkage between ch4 ebullition and autochthonous dom the interaction effects between each two of the variables used in pca except for ch4 efflux can be found in table s5 in the pca modeling of ch4 ebullition the pvi of submerged macrophytes chl a doc a 350 parafac derived c1 c6 during the experiment no variable was stepwise excluded as the significant levels of the eleven indices were all 0 001 table s6 the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 65 5 and 10 9 respectively of the total variability fig 5 log ch4 chl a doc a 350 and parafac derived c1 c6 all displayed positive pc1 loading while macrophyte pvi showed negative pc1 loading fig 5 this result implies that pc1 was positively associated with the controls that fuel the outgassing of ch4 ebullition including algal biomass doc and algal derived dom tyrosine like c4 displayed high pc2 loading fig 5 an indication that pc2 was positively linked to the dom remnant notably higher mean pc1 scores were found in the samples collected from the high than the low nutrient mesocosms in all temperature scenarios t test p 0 001 fig 5 while the effect of temperature on the pc1 scores was insignificant fig 5 3 5 24 h bio incubation results the 24 h bio incubation resulted in a rapid depletion of doc and protein like fluorophores and increasing dissolved ch4 concentrations of both algal dom and soil dom samples fig 6 after 24 h dissolved ch4 for algal dom and soil dom samples had increased from 12 5 0 3 and 8 3 0 1 nmol l 1 to 137 1 4 3 and 18 9 0 3 nmol l 1 respectively 1001 and 128 increase respectively fig 6 as for the algal dom samples doc decreased rapidly from 12 6 0 5 to 2 7 0 2 mg l 1 a 78 4 decrease fig 6 this was in coupled with a rapid decrease in fulvic like c2 tyrosine like c4 tryptophan like c5 and c6 from 0 67 0 04 2 42 0 13 0 56 0 01 and 2 42 0 12 r u to 0 22 0 02 0 51 0 07 0 03 0 03 and 0 68 0 07 r u respectively fig 6 we further found an increased fmax of terrestrial humic like c1 and microbial humic like c3 from 0 01 0 01 and 0 05 0 00 r u to 0 48 0 05 and 0 22 0 00 r u respectively fig 6 for soil dom in comparison doc decreased from 15 3 0 2 to 11 7 0 3 mg l 1 a

found an increased fmax of c5 from 0 02 0 03 to 0 12 0 03 r u fig 6 4 discussion our results indicate that ch4 ebullition in shallow lake mesocosms is shaped by a chain of eutrophication and temperature induced changes in ecosystem structure and function this change is characterised by the shift in the balance between macrophyte abundance pvi and phytoplankton biomass chl a which in turn alters the accumulation of autochthonous bio labile dom the temperature dependence of ch4 production appears to play only a minor direct role compared with the other variables as increased temperature resulted in a weak but insignificant increase in ebullition during the june august observation time fig 1 this is not completely consistent with a previous study in the same experimental facility davidson et al 2018 and the difference may stem from the different timescales covered by the studies for example the lengthening the growing season may be the reason for the more marked temperature effects found in studies covering an entire year davidson et al 2018 our pca results suggested that eutrophication likely enhanced algal blooms and potentially contribute to the loss of submerged macrophytes fig 5 the replacement of submerged macrophytes by dense algal biomass likely enhanced ch4 ebullition fig 3 fig 6 and is consistent with recent studies aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 when the abundances of submerged macrophytes pvi were low and nutrient levels generally high there remained a large degree of variation in ebullition this may partially be explained by the variations in algal biomass as was supported by the linkages among chl a dom composition and ch4 ebullition fig 3 fig 4 fig 6 other studies have shown that high algal biomass is associated with increased ch4 ebullition west et al 2012 delsontro et al 2016 dom derived from algal degradation can be highly bio labile zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 2018a and this labile dom fraction presumably leads to archaeal methanogenesis bogard et al 2014 repeta et al 2016 tang et al 2016 yao et al 2016 possibly augmenting ch4 ebullition also in the shallow lake mesocosms fig 5 ebullition is in the end controlled by ch4 production rates when these exceed dissolution rates then bubbles are formed and it may be that highly labile dom is key for these production rates to exceed this critical value the combination of our different experimental results suggest that microbial mineralization of autochthonous bio labile dom potentially increases ch4 production to levels that far exceed the potential for dissolution likely resulting in enhanced ch4 ebullition the evidence of this is as follows 1 our 24 h bio incubation experiment indicated that compared with soil dom autochthonous algal dom was highly bio labile with rapid depletion of doc and autochthonous cdom fluorophores tyrosine like c4 and tryptophan like c5 c6 elevated bio refractory terrestrial humic like c1 coupled with a rapid increase of dissolved ch4 fig 6 as no sediment or particulate organic matter was added to the headspace bottles markedly higher ch4 outgassing from algal dom compared with soil dom bottles likely reflect archaea cycling of the highly bio labile autochthonous dom fig 6 this is consistent with a recent study that autochthonous tyrosine like c3 and tryptophan like c6 are closely linked with low molecular weight organic acids acetate and butyrate that can be rapidly consumed by microbial uptake drake et al 2015 these results suggest that a rapid microbial reworking of autochthonous bio labile dom within 24 h likely fuelled the accumulation of high levels of ch4 in the algal dom headspace bottles 2 we found a notably higher ch4 ebullition from the high compared with the low nutrient mesocosms across the different temperature scenarios which was coincident with higher levels of autochthonous c3 c6 in the high relative to the low nutrient mesocosms fig 1 fig 5 table s1 our conclusion is further supported by the positive relationships between the ebullitive ch4 flux and δ13c doc δ2h and δ18o fig 3 fig s5 enriched δ13c doc δ2h and δ18o levels were traced in the samples collected from the high but not from the low nutrient mesocosms table s1 fig s5 suggesting accumulation of autochthonous dom in the mesocosms with high nutrient addition extra nutrient addition to the high nutrient mesocosms boosts planktonic algal biomass with higher chl a and autochthonous c3 c6 in these compared with the low nutrient mesocosms fig 1 fig 5 table s1 numerous studies have shown that the microbial humic like component c3 tyrosine like c4 and tryptophan like fluorophores c5 c6 in this study are either produced from microbial mineralization of algal scums in eutrophic waters yamashita and tanoue 2004 stedmon and markager 2005b zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 or residential sewage stedmon et al 2011 the variability of these four autochthonous fluorescent components during the 8 week experimental observation period and the 24 h bio incubation can therefore be regarded as a balance of fresh production and microbial degradation zhang et al 2009 3 the fractions of autochthonous dom c3 c6 in the high nutrient mesocosms are highly bio labile as documented by the positive relationships between the autochthonous fluorescent components c3 c6 and chl a and bdoc fig 4 compared with pvi of macrophytes and chl a the contribution percentage of autochthonous c3 c6 to the variation explained of ch4 ebullition were notably higher fig 5 this result was further supported by the increased contribution and also higher relative abundance of lipids and proteins identified using ft icr ms in the high relative to the low nutrient mesocosms fig 2 fig s4 the positive spearman rank correlations between ch4 ebullition and the relative abundance of the lipids and proteins and also a fraction of lignins fig 2 provided further evidence of this previous studies have suggested that the lipid and protein molecules can be highly bio labile stubbins et al 2012 kellerman et al 2015 2018 feng et al 2016 the microbial cycling of these bio labile fractions of dom possibly increased the ebullition of ch4 thauer et al 2008 bogard et al 2014 repeta et al 2016 in the mesocosms as evidenced by the positive relationship between bdoc and ch4 ebullition fig 3 archaea decomposition of bio labile dom associated with acetate and methylated compounds likely results in release of ch4 as the end product murase and sugimoto 2005 thauer et al 2008 bogard et al 2014 repeta et al 2016 tang et al 2016 in the mesocosms with high nutrient addition it is not simple to quantify the relative importance of sediment organic matter and overlying dom on ch4 ebullition from the experimental facility as dissolved oxygen consumption are prevailing near the bottom and also in the sediment especially the high nutrient mesocosms sediment being present in all the mesocosms also due to the shallow characteristics of the mesocosms with water depth approximately 1 m the short residence time makes dissolution and oxidation unlikely to happen contrary to what can be found in deep lakes beaulieu et al 2016 tang et al 2016 although changes in ch4 ebullition cannot distinguish its carbon source from the sediment or the overlying water columns in the mesocosms the combination of the mesocosm experiment and the 24 bio incubation fig 5 fig 6 exhibited the importance of autochthonous algal dom in enhancing ebullitive ch4 in fluvial plain lakes and shallow lagoons with relatively long water residence time and excessive nutrient loadings from surrounding intensified urbanized areas excessive algal blooms persist from early spring to late autumn or even the whole year qin et al 2007 ma et al 2015 extracellular polysaccharide substances and autochthonous dom associated with the degradation of algal scums represent a large and highly bio labile carbon pool and their accumulation potentially enhance ch4 effluxes from these environments west et al 2012 2015 xiao et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 follow up studies could benefit from quantifying the relative importance of sediment organic rich pore water dom and overlying water dom on ebullitive ch4 efflux by including and excluding sediment in mesocosm experiments the mesocosms are all fed by groundwater liboriussen et al 2005 and the higher dom concentration in the high nutrient compared with the low nutrient mesocosms must be derived from autochthonous degradation of algal biomass since the initial conditions were identical liboriussen et al 2005 zhou et al 2018a a recent study conducted in the same mesocosm facility have revealed that nutrient enrichment decreased the relative contribution of ch4 diffusion from 50 to merely 5 and the diffusive flux with mean efflux 2 mg c m 2 d 1 in all mesocosms exhibited no or limited response to eutrophication and warming davidson et al 2018 and is therefore not discussed further here future research may also focus on quantifying the relative importance of allochthonous and autochthonous dom from various environments in the outgassing of ch4 by examination of methane isotopes and microbial communities 5 conclusions this study is among the first to demonstrate the rapid depletion of bio labile dom potentially fuels the ebullition of ch4 in high nutrient mesocosms with high algal chl a the changes of doc cdom absorption and fluorescence stable isotopes and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry provides insight into the quantitative and compositional changes in the organic carbon pool during the experimental period and the 24 h bio incubation eutrophication is among the most profound anthropogenic impacts on shallow lakes the most abundant water body type worldwide probably fueling the accumulation of autochthonous bio labile dom and the emission of ch4 in these waters our results therefore strongly suggested that carbon cycling rate in shallow eutrophic waters might be significantly underestimated author contributions y q z l z y l z j g d s d c p r g m s e j and t a d conducted the research and performed the analyses y q z wrote

18463,shallow lakes are hotspots for carbon processing and important natural sources of methane ch4 emission ebullitive ch4 flux may constitute the overwhelming majority of total ch4 flux but the episodic nature of ebullition events makes determining both quantity and the controlling factors challenging here we used the world s longest running shallow lake mesocosm facility where the experimental treatments are low and high nutrients crossed with three temperatures to investigate the quantity and drivers of ch4 ebullition the mean ch4 ebullition flux in the high nutrient treatment

in the dark further revealed a rapid depletion of algal dom concurrent with a massive increased ch4 production whereas soil derived dom had a limited effect on ch4 production we conclude that eutrophication likely induced the loss of macrophytes and increase in algal biomass and the resultant accumulation algal derived bio labile dom potentially drives enhanced outgassing of ebullitive ch4

mass spectrometry greenhouse gases 1 introduction small shallow lakes are the most numerous lake type in the world and are hotspots of carbon processing and represent a large yet poorly defined source of atmospheric methane ch4 emission bogard et al 2014 holgerson and raymond 2016 davidson et al 2018 lake ecosystems have been estimated to contribute 16 24 of the world s ch4 emission ciais et al 2014 saunois et al 2016 samad and bertilsson 2017 despite only covering 4 of the earth s non glaciated surface area verpoorter et al 2015 furthermore approximately 50 of the world s lakes measured by surface area are located in climate sensitive regions and the ch4 emission from these small lakes has been estimated to be equivalent to roughly 60 of the emission from all natural ch4 sources wik et al 2016 recent studies have revealed that nutrient enrichment and warming can interact to control the outgassing of ch4 in particular fueling the ebullition of ch4 delsontro et al 2016 2018a davidson et al 2018 both eutrophication and warming can fuel algal blooms leading to the loss of submerged macrophytes and this potentially leads to enhanced diffusive and ebullitive ch4 emissions while submerged plants have been shown to be a potential sink of ch4 davidson et al 2015 2018 furthermore increased algal biomass can result in an elevated production and accumulation of autochthonous dissolved organic matter dom zhou et al 2015 and this portion of algal dom may impact ch4 production rates west et al 2012 2015 although a recent study have revealed that overall trophic status and macrophyte coverage greatly impact ch4 ebullition from shallow lake mesocosms davidson et al 2018 the relative importance of autochthonous and allochthonous dom i e the carbon substrates on ch4 ebullition as well as the mechanisms underlying dom and ebullitive ch4 remain largely unknown archaeal methanogenesis has long been thought to be the major source of biogenic ch4 thauer et al 2008 and the effects of chlorophyll a chl a a surrogate of algal biomass and bulk dissolved organic carbon doc on ch4 production have been investigated west et al 2012 delsontro et al 2018b a recent study have revealed that eutrophication overrode climate warming in enhancing the chl a levels and thereby the accumulation of autochthonous dom zhou et al 2018a the linkage between this dom fraction and ch4 ebullition is however largely unknown the chemical reactivity and bio lability of dom have long been considered to be largely determined by its source and chemical composition stedmon et al 2007 kowalczuk et al 2013 fu et al 2016 yang et al 2017 to what extent there is a direct linkage between ebullition of ch4 from shallow lakes and dom composition is largely unknown the ch4 flux can be divided into three pathways diffusive plant mediated and ebullitive flux and in shallow and eutrophic lakes the ebullitive flux can contribute up to 95 of the total ch4 emission davidson et al 2018 the ch4 ebullition generally increases with increasing primary productivity delsontro et al 2016 but is highly stochastic bastviken et al 2004 making estimation of the flux a challenging task wik et al 2013 microbes especially archaea fuel the rapid degradation of bio labile dom and can result in oxygen depletion in the water column or lake sediment zhou et al 2015 2018b tang et al 2017 and thereby a further increase in the ebullitive flux borges et al 2015 delsontro et al 2016 davidson et al 2018 dom serves as carbon source for ch4 emission in lake ecosystems and is comprised of a mixture of degradation by products and freshly produced compounds that vary remarkably in molecular weight coble 2007 optical measurements including fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis

dittmar and paeng 2009 stubbins et al 2010 spencer et al 2014 hawkes et al 2016 the ultrahigh resolving power and mass measurement accuracy of ft icr ms allow the assignment of molecular formulae to thousands of dom molecules and give considerable advances in obtaining compositional information mopper et al 2007 in productive ecosystems dom derived from the degradation of aquatic organisms contributes importantly to the carbon pool and represents a considerable fraction of the bio labile dom hur et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 huang et al 2018 song et al 2018 microbial cycling of bio labile dom may potentially fuel the outgassing of ch4 zhou et al 2018b to date however to the best of our knowledge there has been no attempt to characterise the direct linkage between dom composition and bio lability and the ebullition of ch4 we combined investigation at a long running mesocosm experiment mimicking shallow lakes with laboratory bio incubation experiments to investigate the impact of dom composition and bioavailability on the ebullition of ch4 ebullition was measured continuously and the percentage volume inhabited pvi of submerged macrophytes and values of chl a doc and optical dom were determined weekly to trace possible drivers of ch4 ebullition we hypothesised that highly bio labile autochthonous dom accumulated in the high nutrient mesocosms may fuel the outgassing of ch4 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experimental facility mimicking shallow lakes located in lemming denmark 56 23 n 9 52 e has run continuously since august 2003 and is the longest running mesocosm experiment in the world aiming to unravel the combined effects of global warming and eutrophication on shallow lakes liboriussen et al 2005 briefly the experiment consists of 24 fully mixed flow through experimental shallow lake mesocosms diameter 1 9 m water depth 1 m water residence time 2 5 months under six different treatments three temperature levels crossed with two nutrient treatments in four replicates the three temperature treatments include unheated ambient mesocosms amb ipcc climate scenario a2 a2 houghton et al 2001 and a2 50 a2 with temperatures 2 3 c and 4 5 c higher than amb respectively depending on season adjusted monthly the monthly temperatures were determined from regional downscaling of the gcm models liboriussen et al 2005 using 1960 1990 as the reference period and the modeled temperatures for 2071 2100 liboriussen et al 2005 the a2 and a2 mesocosms all exhibited seasonal and diurnal water temperature fluctuations following the amb mesocosms liboriussen et al 2005 sediment collected from several natural lakes around lemming denmark was homogenised and added to the mesocosms 10 cm depth prior to the initialisation of the experiment in 2003 and all the mesocosms share identical initial conditions liboriussen et al 2005 the experimental shallow lake mesocosms are all fed by groundwater dissolved inorganic carbon 31 4 3 8 mg l 1 and dissolved organic carbon doc 1 06 0 42 mg l 1 thus representing groundwater fed small shallow lakes the low nutrient experimental mesocosms receive no additional nutrients and total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations were 0 18 mg l 1 and 14 μg l 1 respectively during the experiment the extra loading of tn and tp to the high nutrient experimental mesocosms are 7 mgn m 2 d 1 and 27 1 μgp m 2 d 1 respectively within the mesocosms mean values of 3 17 mg l 1 tn and 417 μg l 1 tp during the experiment were observed for the high nutrient treatment the extra nutrient loading caused a shift from the clear water conditions existing in the low nutrient mesocosms to turbid water in the high nutrient mesocosms there were no floating or emergent plants in the mesocosms and we quantified the submerged plants as pvi in the water column following the approach detailed in reference davidson et al 2018 briefly the coverage percentage and height of the submerged plants were determined and the proportion of the mesocosms covered by submerged plants was correspondingly assessed plant abundance was investigated weekly when gas and dom samples were collected 2 2 ebullitive ch4 sampling and flux calculations the ebullitive flux was determined following the approach detailed in reference davidson et al 2018 briefly specially designed gas traps with two inverted funnels connected with 500 ml glass bottles were placed right below the water surface in each mesocosm the funnels were located 0 2 m below the water surface in the same position in each mesocosm the funnels cover an area of 0 0225 m2 and represent 0 8 of the total area of the mesocosms this is a much larger proportion of the total mesocosm area compared with samples taken in typical natural lakes and the obtained ebullitive flux measurements are thus supposedly more reliable wik et al 2013 davidson et al 2018 samples were collected every week from june to august 2016 8 occasions in total the sample volume was determined and the ch4 gas was collected from the bottle with a syringe 50 ml fitted with a three way stopcock using a specially designed lid equipped with rubber septa the funnels and bottles were cleaned or replaced every week during the experiment the volume of ebullitive bubbles never exceeded 400 ml during the experiment methane concentrations were determined on an innova photoaccoustic gas monitor which is suited to the very high concentrations of ch4 up to 100 000 ppm in the bubbles the results were validated using the results measured on an agilent 7890 gas chromatograph system agilent denmark davidson et al 2018 the ebullitive ch4 flux was calculated using the method detailed in reference davidson et al 2018 1 ebullitive ch4 flux pch4bub volbub t a where pch4bub and volbub are the ch4 concentration and volume of the trapped bubbles respectively t and a are the sampling time interval and the area of the funnel 0 0225 m2 due to the very low solubility of ch4 we assume the effect of re dissolved ch4 during the weekly sampling intervals to be minor davidson et al 2018 2 3 cdom sample collection and bio incubation experiment water samples were collected twice per day at 19 00 and 07 00 the next morning once a week for eight weeks from june to august 2016 from the experimental mesocosms using acid cleaned niskin bottles a total of 387 water samples 24 mesocosms 2 times per day 8 weeks 3 source water groundwater samples were collected and immediately filtered through whatman

is available for microbial uptake and operationally biodegradable doc bdoc is defined as the percentage of doc being mineralized over a certain period of time typically 28 days holmes et al 2008 mann et al 2012 abbott et al 2014 vonk et al 2015 bdoc usually increased logarithmically with increasing incubation time and varies minimally after two weeks of bio incubation spencer et al 2015 dom samples collected in the sixth week of the mesocosm experiment were used for 28 days of bio incubation under room termperature 20 2 c to unveil the bio lability of doc in the mesocosms and how bdoc may influence ch4 ebullition following the methods detailed in zhou et al 2018a and can be found in the supporting information to unravel the potential role of autochthonous algal dom in fuelling the outgassing of ch4 we carried out a 24 h bio incubation experiment for soil dom and algal dom soil dom and algal dom samples were used to simulate the optical properties of dom samples collected from the groundwater fed experimental facilities without and with the addition of external nutrients boosting algal blooms approximately 10 kg organic rich topsoil from the lake taihu watershed and 10 l algae samples enriched using phytoplankton net from lake taihu were collected in the nearshore of meiliang bay lake taihu on 20 september 2018 during a microcystis algal bloom approximately 20 l mill q water was added to the topsoil and the algae samples respectively the mixtures were both shaken at 300 rpm for 30 min and then gently shaken several times a day to keep them oxidised and degraded in the dark at 20 2 c for three days soil leachate and algal water mixture were successively filtered through pre rinsed whatman gf d 2 7 μm porosity and millipore filters 0 22 μm the soil dom and algal dom samples were both diluted to ensure a roughly similar initial doc concentration 15 mg l 1 three aliquots filtered through millipore filters for both soil dom and algal dom determination were immediately 0 h measured for cdom absorption and fluorescence as well as doc concentrations three additional aliquot filtrates for both soil dom and algal dom measurement were poured into 61 ml acid cleaned and pre rinsed brown glass bottles with excess dom sample overflowing the bottles the bottles were then immediately capped without headspace using a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with an aluminium cap n2 gas ultrahigh purity 99 999 was injected into the bottle via two syringes to create a 10 ml headspace following the methods detailed in xiao et al 2017 each vial for bio incubation had the headspace flushed three times with n2 gas for 30 s prior to the incubation the bottles were shaken vigorously for 10 min to allow the dissolved ch4 to get into equilibrium with the headspace an approximately 5 ml gas sample was drawn from the headspace using a syringe with a three way stopcork and injected into a gas chromatograph model agilent gc6890n agilent co ca usa with a flame ionization detector for ch4 detection 2 ml soil and algal leachates filtered through gf d filters 2 7 μm porosity were used as bacterial inoculum and extra nutrients were added following the aforementioned methods for bdoc measurements abbott et al 2014 vonk et al 2015 after 24 h incubation 20 2 c the samples were immediately filtered through millipore filters for doc cdom absorption and fluorescence measurements and headspace bottles filled with soil dom and algal dom samples were immediately measured for dissolved ch4 2 4 cdom optical measurements calibration and parafac modelling

amb intermediate temperature groups a2 2 3 c and the warmest a2 4 5 c temperature groups t test p 0 001 fig 1 table s1 we found a significantly higher mean ebullitive ch4 flux in the a2 and a2 scenarios compared with the amb scenario for the high nutrient group t test p 0 05 fig 1 table s1 while no significant difference was found between a2 and a2 for the high nutrient group fig 1 table s1 no significant difference was observed in mean ebullitive ch4 flux among the three temperature treatments for the low nutrient group anova fig 1 table s1 elevated nutrient levels have shifted the mesocosms from a macrophyte dominated clear water state to an algal dominated turbid state thereby changing the physico chemical conditions of the water column liboriussen et al 2005 fig 1 similar

reaction pathways of dom molecules in various aquatic environments kim et al 2003 dittmar and paeng 2009 stubbins et al 2010 spencer et al 2014 kellerman et al 2015 we selected samples collected from the amb and a2 temperature scenarios crossed with the two nutrient levels to exhibit how eutrophication and warming may change the molecular signature of dom fig 2 for the amb temperature scenario a decreased relative abundance at molecular weight m z 500 800 was recorded for the dom sample collected from the high relative to the low nutrient treatment fig 2 this resulted in an increased relative abundance of lipids amino acids associated with proteins and lignins and a decreased relative abundance of carbohydrates and unsaturated hydrocarbons for the high relative to the low nutrient treatment fig 2 fig s4 for the a2 scenario in comparison eutrophication decreased the average molecular weight of dom collected from the high relative to the low nutrient treatment resulting in a shifting of the bell like relative intensity distribution centered from around m z 400 to m z 350 fig 2 a notable higher relative abundance of lipids amino acids associated with proteins were found for the high relative to the low nutrient mesocosms fig 2 fig s4 for the amb and a2 scenarios crossed with the two nutrient treatments lipids and amino acids associated with proteins contributed 1530 2251 peaks zhou et al 2018a which represent 15 1 30 9 of the total assigned formulas and 9 3 34 5 of total relative abundance tables s2 s3 aliphatic compounds contributed 1697 2562 peaks making up a contribution of 17 41 of the total assigned formulas and 11 1 49 5 of total relative abundance for the above mentioned four samples table s4 in comparison lignins contributed 2392 8688 signals represent 42 70 of the total formulas assigned and 34 6 71 6 of the total relative abundance of the four dom samples fig s4 tables s2 s3 this constituted the greatest contribution percentages to the total assigned formulas the results being consistent with those of a previous study in the same experimental facility showing that terrestrial humic rich fluorophores contributed significantly to the eems spectrum fig s3 zhou et al 2018a lipids proteins and amino sugars often originate from microbial degradation of algal biomass in aquatic ecosystems while lignin can be categorised as the unique remnants of terrestrial organic rich dom dittmar and paeng 2009 stubbins et al 2010 spencer et al 2014 kellerman et al 2015 in this study cho contributed 2445 4653 peaks accounting for 37 43 of the total formulas assigned and 37 7 45 2 of the total relative abundance to the amb and a2 treatments crossed with low and high nutrients table s4 in comparison chon only and chos only compounds contributed 2544 5284 and 750 2666 peaks or 39 44 and 13 21 of the total assigned formulas corresponding to 30 6 53 0 and 9 2 27 5 of the total relative abundance respectively table s4 a total of 3705 peaks were correlated notably with ch4 ebullition with absolute spearman rank correlation coefficients r 0 4 fig 2 we found the relative abundance of a total of 3031 peaks mostly lipids proteins and lignins were positively correlated to ch4 ebullition while the remaining 674 peaks mostly unsaturated hydrocarbons negatively correlated to ch4 ebullition fig 2 3 4 relationships between macrophyte abundance chl a dom related indices and ebullitive ch4 flux and pca results we found that the ebullitive ch4 flux was significantly negatively related to macrophyte abundance pvi and positively with algal chl a fig 3 the ebullitive ch4 flux was also significantly positively related to doc a 350 bdoc δ13c doc and fmax of all the six parafac components fig 3 notably the r 2 for the linear models between all the six components and the ebullitive ch4 flux for the twenty four mesocosms were higher than 0 4 fig 3 eutrophication increased the concentration of autochthonous dom and lowered the specific heat capacity in the water column of the high nutrient mesocosms which resulted in enriched δ2h and δ18o we found significant positive relationships between surface water δ2h and ebullitive ch4 δ13c doc doc fulvic like c2 microbial humic like c3 and tryptophan like c5 c6 fig s5 the concentration of autochthonous dom was closely linked to the algal blooms induced by nutrient addition we found negative relationships between macrophyte abundance pvi and microbial humic like c3 tyrosine like c4 and tryptophan like c5 c6 fig 4 we further found positive relationships between algal chl a and c3 c6 fig 4 these relationships indicate that degradation of algal chl a rather than macrophytes was the major source of autochthonous bio labile dom in the mesocosms enhanced accumulation of autochthonous bio labile c3 c6 resulted in elevated bdoc of the dom samples fig 4 in one sample collected from low nutrient groups the bdoc value 55 was repeatedly identified as an outlier and this was therefore removed from the subsequent analyses fig 3 fig 4 we further used the calc relimp function based on glm modelling inbuilt in r to unveiling the relative importance of pvi chl a and dom related parameters in fueling ch4 ebullition from the mesocosms 77 of the variability of ch4 ebullition was explained by a total of ten variables including macrophyte abundance pvi chl a doc a 350 parafac derived c1 c6 fig 5 among the ten variables autochthonous bio labile c3 c6 contributed to 46 5 of the variation explained fig 5 microbial humic like c3 and tryptophan like c5 were among the ten variables included in the calc relimp with significance level p 0 01 fig 5 pca can be used to produce a reduced dataset explaining the variation in the majority of variables aiding in the interpretation of the variables with no prior knowledge bro and smilde 2014 in this study we used pca to summarizing the potential drivers of ch4 ebullition and ch4 efflux itself to unravel the potential linkage between ch4 ebullition and autochthonous dom the interaction effects between each two of the variables used in pca except for ch4 efflux can be found in table s5 in the pca modeling of ch4 ebullition the pvi of submerged macrophytes chl a doc a 350 parafac derived c1 c6 during the experiment no variable was stepwise excluded as the significant levels of the eleven indices were all 0 001 table s6 the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 65 5 and 10 9 respectively of the total variability fig 5 log ch4 chl a doc a 350 and parafac derived c1 c6 all displayed positive pc1 loading while macrophyte pvi showed negative pc1 loading fig 5 this result implies that pc1 was positively associated with the controls that fuel the outgassing of ch4 ebullition including algal biomass doc and algal derived dom tyrosine like c4 displayed high pc2 loading fig 5 an indication that pc2 was positively linked to the dom remnant notably higher mean pc1 scores were found in the samples collected from the high than the low nutrient mesocosms in all temperature scenarios t test p 0 001 fig 5 while the effect of temperature on the pc1 scores was insignificant fig 5 3 5 24 h bio incubation results the 24 h bio incubation resulted in a rapid depletion of doc and protein like fluorophores and increasing dissolved ch4 concentrations of both algal dom and soil dom samples fig 6 after 24 h dissolved ch4 for algal dom and soil dom samples had increased from 12 5 0 3 and 8 3 0 1 nmol l 1 to 137 1 4 3 and 18 9 0 3 nmol l 1 respectively 1001 and 128 increase respectively fig 6 as for the algal dom samples doc decreased rapidly from 12 6 0 5 to 2 7 0 2 mg l 1 a 78 4 decrease fig 6 this was in coupled with a rapid decrease in fulvic like c2 tyrosine like c4 tryptophan like c5 and c6 from 0 67 0 04 2 42 0 13 0 56 0 01 and 2 42 0 12 r u to 0 22 0 02 0 51 0 07 0 03 0 03 and 0 68 0 07 r u respectively fig 6 we further found an increased fmax of terrestrial humic like c1 and microbial humic like c3 from 0 01 0 01 and 0 05 0 00 r u to 0 48 0 05 and 0 22 0 00 r u respectively fig 6 for soil dom in comparison doc decreased from 15 3 0 2 to 11 7 0 3 mg l 1 a 23 6 decrease fig 6 c1 c4 and c6 decreased from 1 04 0 01 2 00 0 01 0 50 0 00 1 12 0 05 and 1 61 0 08 r u to 1 03 0 08 1 59 0 16 0 37 0 02 0 56 0 04 and 0 78 0 06 r u respectively fig 6 we further found an increased fmax of c5 from 0 02 0 03 to 0 12 0 03 r u fig 6 4 discussion our results indicate that ch4 ebullition in shallow lake mesocosms is shaped by a chain of eutrophication and temperature induced changes in ecosystem structure and function this change is characterised by the shift in the balance between macrophyte abundance pvi and phytoplankton biomass chl a which in turn alters the accumulation of autochthonous bio labile dom the temperature dependence of ch4 production appears to play only a minor direct role compared with the other variables as increased temperature resulted in a weak but insignificant increase in ebullition during the june august observation time fig 1 this is not completely consistent with a previous study in the same experimental facility davidson et al 2018 and the difference may stem from the different timescales covered by the studies for example the lengthening the growing season may be the reason for the more marked temperature effects found in studies covering an entire year davidson et al 2018 our pca results suggested that eutrophication likely enhanced algal blooms and potentially contribute to the loss of submerged macrophytes fig 5 the replacement of submerged macrophytes by dense algal biomass likely enhanced ch4 ebullition fig 3 fig 6 and is consistent with recent studies aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 when the abundances of submerged macrophytes pvi were low and nutrient levels generally high there remained a large degree of variation in ebullition this may partially be explained by the variations in algal biomass as was supported by the linkages among chl a dom composition and ch4 ebullition fig 3 fig 4 fig 6 other studies have shown that high algal biomass is associated with increased ch4 ebullition west et al 2012 delsontro et al 2016 dom derived from algal degradation can be highly bio labile zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 2018a and this labile dom fraction presumably leads to archaeal methanogenesis bogard et al 2014 repeta et al 2016 tang et al 2016 yao et al 2016 possibly augmenting ch4 ebullition also in the shallow lake mesocosms fig 5 ebullition is in the end controlled by ch4 production rates when these exceed dissolution rates then bubbles are formed and it may be that highly labile dom is key for these production rates to exceed this critical value the combination of our different experimental results suggest that microbial mineralization of autochthonous bio labile dom potentially increases ch4 production to levels that far exceed the potential for dissolution likely resulting in enhanced ch4 ebullition the evidence of this is as follows 1 our 24 h bio incubation experiment indicated that compared with soil dom autochthonous algal dom was highly bio labile with rapid depletion of doc and autochthonous cdom fluorophores tyrosine like c4 and tryptophan like c5 c6 elevated bio refractory terrestrial humic like c1 coupled with a rapid increase of dissolved ch4 fig 6 as no sediment or particulate organic matter was added to the headspace bottles markedly higher ch4 outgassing from algal dom compared with soil dom bottles likely reflect archaea cycling of the highly bio labile autochthonous dom fig 6 this is consistent with a recent study that autochthonous tyrosine like c3 and tryptophan like c6 are closely linked with low molecular weight organic acids acetate and butyrate that can be rapidly consumed by microbial uptake drake et al 2015 these results suggest that a rapid microbial reworking of autochthonous bio labile dom within 24 h likely fuelled the accumulation of high levels of ch4 in the algal dom headspace bottles 2 we found a notably higher ch4 ebullition from the high compared with the low nutrient mesocosms across the different temperature scenarios which was coincident with higher levels of autochthonous c3 c6 in the high relative to the low nutrient mesocosms fig 1 fig 5 table s1 our conclusion is further supported by the positive relationships between the ebullitive ch4 flux and δ13c doc δ2h and δ18o fig 3 fig s5 enriched δ13c doc δ2h and δ18o levels were traced in the samples collected from the high but not from the low nutrient mesocosms table s1 fig s5 suggesting accumulation of autochthonous dom in the mesocosms with high nutrient addition extra nutrient addition to the high nutrient mesocosms boosts planktonic algal biomass with higher chl a and autochthonous c3 c6 in these compared with the low nutrient mesocosms fig 1 fig 5 table s1 numerous studies have shown that the microbial humic like component c3 tyrosine like c4 and tryptophan like fluorophores c5 c6 in this study are either produced from microbial mineralization of algal scums in eutrophic waters yamashita and tanoue 2004 stedmon and markager 2005b zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 or residential sewage stedmon et al 2011 the variability of these four autochthonous fluorescent components during the 8 week experimental observation period and the 24 h bio incubation can therefore be regarded as a balance of fresh production and microbial degradation zhang et al 2009 3 the fractions of autochthonous dom c3 c6 in the high nutrient mesocosms are highly bio labile as documented by the positive relationships between the autochthonous fluorescent components c3 c6 and chl a and bdoc fig 4 compared with pvi of macrophytes and chl a the contribution percentage of autochthonous c3 c6 to the variation explained of ch4 ebullition were notably higher fig 5 this result was further supported by the increased contribution and also higher relative abundance of lipids and proteins identified using ft icr ms in the high relative to the low nutrient mesocosms fig 2 fig s4 the positive spearman rank correlations between ch4 ebullition and the relative abundance of the lipids and proteins and also a fraction of lignins fig 2 provided further evidence of this previous studies have suggested that the lipid and protein molecules can be highly bio labile stubbins et al 2012 kellerman et al 2015 2018 feng et al 2016 the microbial cycling of these bio labile fractions of dom possibly increased the ebullition of ch4 thauer et al 2008 bogard et al 2014 repeta et al 2016 in the mesocosms as evidenced by the positive relationship between bdoc and ch4 ebullition fig 3 archaea decomposition of bio labile dom associated with acetate and methylated compounds likely results in release of ch4 as the end product murase and sugimoto 2005 thauer et al 2008 bogard et al 2014 repeta et al 2016 tang et al 2016 in the mesocosms with high nutrient addition it is not simple to quantify the relative importance of sediment organic matter and overlying dom on ch4 ebullition from the experimental facility as dissolved oxygen consumption are prevailing near the bottom and also in the sediment especially the high nutrient mesocosms sediment being present in all the mesocosms also due to the shallow characteristics of the mesocosms with water depth approximately 1 m the short residence time makes dissolution and oxidation unlikely to happen contrary to what can be found in deep lakes beaulieu et al 2016 tang et al 2016 although changes in ch4 ebullition cannot distinguish its carbon source from the sediment or the overlying water columns in the mesocosms the combination of the mesocosm experiment and the 24 bio incubation fig 5 fig 6 exhibited the importance of autochthonous algal dom in enhancing ebullitive ch4 in fluvial plain lakes and shallow lagoons with relatively long water residence time and excessive nutrient loadings from surrounding intensified urbanized areas excessive algal blooms persist from early spring to late autumn or even the whole year qin et al 2007 ma et al 2015 extracellular polysaccharide substances and autochthonous dom associated with the degradation of algal scums represent a large and highly bio labile carbon pool and their accumulation potentially enhance ch4 effluxes from these environments west et al 2012 2015 xiao et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 follow up studies could benefit from quantifying the relative importance of sediment organic rich pore water dom and overlying water dom on ebullitive ch4 efflux by including and excluding sediment in mesocosm experiments the mesocosms are all fed by groundwater liboriussen et al 2005 and the higher dom concentration in the high nutrient compared with the low nutrient mesocosms must be derived from autochthonous degradation of algal biomass since the initial conditions were identical liboriussen et al 2005 zhou et al 2018a a recent study conducted in the same mesocosm facility have revealed that nutrient enrichment decreased the relative contribution of ch4 diffusion from 50 to merely 5 and the diffusive flux with mean efflux 2 mg c m 2 d 1 in all mesocosms exhibited no or limited response to eutrophication and warming davidson et al 2018 and is therefore not discussed further here future research may also focus on quantifying the relative importance of allochthonous and autochthonous dom from various environments in the outgassing of ch4 by examination of methane isotopes and microbial communities 5 conclusions this study is among the first to demonstrate the rapid depletion of bio labile dom potentially fuels the ebullition of ch4 in high nutrient mesocosms with high algal chl a the changes of doc cdom absorption and fluorescence stable isotopes and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry provides insight into the quantitative and compositional changes in the organic carbon pool during the experimental period and the 24 h bio incubation eutrophication is among the most profound anthropogenic impacts on shallow lakes the most abundant water body type worldwide probably fueling the accumulation of autochthonous bio labile dom and the emission of ch4 in these waters our results therefore strongly suggested that carbon cycling rate in shallow eutrophic waters might be significantly underestimated author contributions y q z l z y l z j g d s d c p r g m s e j and t a d conducted the research and performed the analyses y q z wrote

18464,the magnitude of environmental change due to anthropogenic impacts might greatly exceed that of natural disturbances in this work we quantitatively examine the impacts of river damming soil erosion and point source release on the transport of methylmercury mehg throughout the yangtze river the third longest river in the world based on seasonal observations and the subsequent material flow analysis we found that in 2016 the yangtze river discharged 470 200 kg mehg to the coastal and shelf areas a value at least ten fold larger than existing observations in other large rivers around the world the construction of the three gorges dam tgd the world s largest hydropower dam induced a substantial amount of mehg at least 250 220 kg accumulation in the reservoir and a relatively small amount of mehg 150 37 kg discharge to the downstream region in 2016 the reservoir itself is not expected to be more contaminated by mehg than the downstream areas of the river after the tgd and the tgd has an additive effect on downstream mehg transport the riverine mehg flux in the river mouth was 3 fold that discharged from the tgd mainly due to tgd induced resuspension of mehg from the downstream riverbed as well as mehg imports to the downstream area from tributaries soil erosion municipal wastewater and in situ production our analysis offers new evidence that in future decades the increase in estuarine mehg contamination resulting from the increasing construction of large dams might pose a challenge for global coastal fisheries graphical abstract image 1 keywords methylmercury river continuum coastal ocean river damming soil erosion point source release 1 introduction methylmercury mehg is a potent neurotoxin that is biomagnified in marine and freshwater food webs and poses health risks for humans and wildlife lavoie et al 2013 mason et al 2012 rivers connect mercury hg in the terrestrial ecosystem and from atmospheric deposition with its subsequent export to the coastal ocean and to the food webs and has been considered as a major hg source in the coastal ocean mason et al 2012 the quantification of the flux of riverine hg discharge to the coastal ocean has been conducted widely buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 sonke et al 2018 as described in the following text a major knowledge gap exists with respect to how mehg is transported throughout the riverine ecosystem to the coastal ocean and how it is modulated by natural and anthropogenic perturbations namely river damming soil erosion water induced and municipal wastewater hg cycling in the aquatic environment is influenced by landscape perturbations such as the creation of reservoirs due to river damming which has raised scientific concerns hsu kim et al 2018 flooding associated with reservoirs causes a long term increase in mehg production in many river basins and is considered to be a result of decomposing terrestrial organic matter which leads to the increasing activities of methylating bacteria and an increased net mehg production in flooded soils bravo et al 2018 hall et al 2005 podar et al 2015 schartup et al 2015 st louis et al 2004 for example research in the experimental lakes of canada showed that flooding increased mehg concentrations in the water column by a factor of 40 st louis et al 2004 research in recent decades has verified that reservoirs can elevate hg concentrations in fish brigham et al 2002 kamman et al 2005 meister et al 1979 possible alterations to the downstream mehg fluxes due to mehg releases from reservoirs have been evaluated in some river basins for example kasper et al 2014 investigated the effects of reservoir stratification on downstream export of mehg formed in reservoirs of the balbina hydroelectric dam in the uatumã river kasper et al 2014 calder et al 2016 evaluated the mehg transport in a small river basin in canada and forecasted a 10 fold increase in riverine mehg levels and 2 6 fold increase in estuarine surface waters due to mehg origination from the reservoir calder et al 2016 nevertheless these efforts were carried out in small river basins and are still under question in downstream of large rivers most previous studies focused on impacts of mehg from reservoirs on downstream areas and damming induced downstream hydrological impacts that influence downstream mehg loading are not well understood terrestrial ecosystems including agricultural and forested ecosystems and urban areas can effectively sequester hg from the atmosphere by accumulation in vegetation and soils obrist et al 2011 in most cases soil

example the extensive human induced deforestation taking place in developing countries has caused a substantial release of total hg thg all forms of hg from the land surface into the aquatic environment in the past several decades liu et al 2018b roulet et al 1999 in streams flowing through harvested and agricultural catchments increases in mehg loads in the water have been observed and were attributed to the increased soil erosion in the catchments eklof et al 2014 kronberg et al 2016 porvari et al 2003 previous studies found that the anthropogenic point source release was a significant source of thg to the freshwater environment in both global 1000 mg yr and regional scales for example 110 mg yr in china especially in developing regions kocman et al 2017 liu et al 2017 although it is unclear for the case of mehg in addition mehg could be produced from the methylation of inorganic hg that was previously discharged into the river in situ sedimentary production and mobilization or be degraded processes which are controlled by physicochemical characteristics such as ph value nutrients dissolved organic matter and other environmental parameters barkay and wagner döbler 2005 hsu kim et al 2018 klapstein and o driscoll 2018 schartup et al 2015 nevertheless the relative importance of in situ mehg production compared with external sources contributions of soil erosion and municipal wastewater to riverine mehg is still unclear in many large rivers to quantitatively understand the impacts of river damming and external mehg sources soil erosion and municipal wastewater on mehg transport in a large river we first collected samples of freshwater and suspended sediment across the yangtze river basin fig 1 and fig s1 in the supporting information si covering approximately 3300 km of the river in different seasons in 2016 this is the first measurement of mehg across the yangtze river second we applied material flow analysis to quantitatively describe how the mehg transport is modulated by river damming large scale soil erosion and municipal wastewater and to assess the importance of in situ production compared with external inputs of mehg this study is motivated by our recognition of the potential confluence of river damming together with other sources on the transport of mehg in a large river which shares motivation with global environmental protection and enhancement of food security 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river originates in the tibetan plateau and flows through the densely populated eastern region of china the river is the third longest river 6400 km in the world and discharges large amounts of freshwater and suspended sediment 1000 km3 yr and 150 tg yr in 2016 respectively into the western margin of north pacific ocean mwr 2016 the river basin is inhabited by approximately 500 million people and is one of the most developed industrial regions in the world human activities such as agriculture animal husbandry and mining have resulted in elevated hg contamination and serious soil erosion in the river basin in the past several decades figs s2 and si liu et al 2018b the three gorges dam tgd the largest dam 185 m high and 2335 m long that generates the largest amount of hydroelectricity in the world is situated halfway along the yangtze river fig 1 stone 2008 2 2 sample collection filtered water and suspended particles were collected in 2016 from 12 sites close to hydrographic gauging stations across the yangtze river basin to quantify the mehg fluxes across the river we collected the samples using techniques employed in previous studies buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 schuster et al 2011 as highlighted by other researchers seasonal sampling was lacking for hg fluxes in large rivers amos et al 2014 emmerton et al 2013 therefore for sample sites in the main stream of the river fig 1 we collected samples during all four seasons spring february to april summer may to july autumn august to october and winter november to january for six major tributaries and lakes of the river basin including the han wu jialing and min rivers and the poyang and dongting lakes which have both the highest freshwater and suspended sediment discharges into the yangtze river in the river basin we collected samples during the wet may to october and dry remaining of the year seasons the detailed sampling information are provided in table s1 and figs s1 and si prior to sampling all bottles in the laboratory were cleaned by immersion in a 10 hno3 vol vol bath for at least 24 h followed by repeated rinses in milli q grade water 18 2 mω cm other cleaning steps followed the u s environmental protection agency method epa 1998 it is difficult to sample water from different depths of a large river following published literature in other large rivers buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 the sampling was conducted from a boat at each site and riverine water was collected by a peristaltic pump from approximately 1 m below the water s surface into precleaned amber glass bottles buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 liu et al 2017 schartup et al 2015 we avoided precipitation days for sampling liu et al 2017 sample sites were selected in the middle of the main stream and tributaries that have no known nearby point source influences such as wastewater discharge chen et al 2019a water was also sampled in the yangtze river mouth on three to four consecutive days of each season to identify any potential time differences in the river mouth the tidal influence on the sampling site in the river mouth is limited dai and liu 2013 saito et al 2001 it is a challenge for us to sample water from the bottom of the three gorges reservoir hence for the location of the tgd we set two sampling sites at 0 5 km before and 3 km after the tgd to identify the potential change in mehg levels before and after the tgd we collected triplicate or quadruplicate water samples 1000 ml of each bottle from each site depending on the particle concentration in the water column of each site to avoid sample contamination we used a method commonly known as clean hands dirty hands emmerton et al 2013 we filtered all water samples through a cellulose nitrate membrane with 0 45 μm pore size whatman product code 10401170 for 300 to 1000 ml of riverine bulk water we preserved the filtered water samples by adding 4 ml l of 11 6 m trace metal grade hydrochloric acid hcl equal to 0 4 of the sample volume and stored the filtered water and particle samples under cool and dark conditions the samples were delivered by high speed rail transport or by air to our lab in beijing within 24 h filtered water and particles samples were stored at 4 c or were preserved by freezing respectively until analysis 2 3 analytical methodology filtered water and suspended particles analysis analyzed for mehg following the methods of previous studies buck et al 2015 munson et al 2014 in brief dissolved mehg dmehg was determined from an acidified sample 1 h2so4 12 h and particulate mehg pmehg was leached with 4 5 m hno3 in a water bath at 60 1 c for 12 h all filtered water samples and extract liquors were neutralized with koh buffered with acetate subjected to improved extraction with ascorbic acid derivatized into methylethylmercury with sodium tetraethyl borate and quantified using gas chromatographic cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry gc afs tekran 2700 all particle samples were extracted in duplicate mehg was analyzed at the ministry of education laboratory of earth surface process in peking university the method detection limit dl was 4 pg l for mehg which was calculated based on the average concentrations of the method blanks plus triple the standard deviation of the blanks spike recoveries 0 5 ng l for ambient mehg samples were 88 10 field blanks in different seasons ranged from dl to 0 02 ng l and most of the field blanks are not significantly higher than the limit mehg was detectable in all samples and the concentrations were adjusted using individual internal standard spike recoveries the thg concentrations of the samples are referenced from our other study liu et al 2019a which applied cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry cvafs tekran 2600 at the institute of tibetan plateau research emmerton et al 2013 the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc in the filter water samples were determined using a toc 5000a instrument shimadzu corp japan in peking university water quality parameters such as temperature t dissolved oxygen do and ph value were measured by a portable analyzer radiometer analytical in the fields 2 4 material flow analysis for mehg transport across the yangtze river material flow analysis has historically been used as an effective tool to offer a system oriented view of the interlinked processes of contaminants such as carbon nutrients organic pollutants and trace metals including thg bai et al 2016 brunner and rechberger 2016 chen et al 2019b churkina 2008 lin et al 2016 in this study we applied this technique to understand how mehg transport is modulated by river damming as well as large scale soil erosion and municipal wastewater this study is the first time that this technique was applied to mehg transport in a large river based on a source to sink process of freshwater and suspended sediment in the river system the calculation of material flow for mehg transport in the yangtze river began with the imports of mehg from tributaries municipal wastewater and soil erosion and continued with mehg transport in each section of the main stream with a final step of mehg release into the coastal ocean or accumulation in the riverbed the analysis was established based on the mass balance principle given below 1 i k s o u r c e i k δ k j k s i n k j k where i and j are different sources and sinks of mehg respectively k is the section from 1 to 5 of the main stream of the yangtze river basin as a temporary pool of mehg s o u r c e i k is the source i of mehg kg yr in the water column of section k s i n k j k represents the sink j of mehg kg yr in section k and δ k is defined as the uncertainty of the mass balance system kg yr of section k in this work we divide the main stream of the river into five sections boxes upstream jinsha river k 1 the front portion of the reservoir from yibin city to chongqing city k 2 the back portion of the reservoir from chongqing city to the tgd k 3 the front portion of the downstream area from the tgd to wuhan city k 4 and the back portion of the downstream area from wuhan city to the river mouth k 5 s o u r c e i k can be calculated as written below 2 i k s o u r c e i k k t k k m k k s k where t k m k and s k are imports of mehg from tributaries municipal wastewater and soil erosion kg yr respectively to the main stream of the yangtze river the contributions of the tributaries are calculated as shown below 3 t a c d a f d a c p a s s d a where c d a and c p a represent the concentrations of dmehg ng l and pmehg ng g in tributary a t a respectively and f d a and s s d a represent the amounts of freshwater discharge km3 yr and suspended sediment discharge tg yr from tributary a into the main stream in equation 2 the distribution of municipal wastewater release of mehg to the main stream was taken from our published paper figs s2 and si following previous studies in the new york estuary and long island sound we consider the discharge of mehg from municipal wastewater in the current study balcom et al 2004 2008 a lack of mehg measurement in natural soil exists across the yangtze river basin because mehg contamination in the soil ecosystem in china has received relatively little attention to date particularly in geographic regions outside of the hg mining areas of guizhou province revis et al 1990 and mailman and bodaly 2005 suggested that approximately 1 of the thg in natural soil is mehg mailman and bodaly 2005 revis et al 1990 whereas horvat et al 2003 found that the percentage of mehg in soils rarely exceeds 1 in china horvat et al 2003 the thg concentrations in soils across china are relatively high compared with other regions liu et al 2018b based on the published literature in china tables s2 and si we calculated that 0 31 0 29 mean standard deviation ranged from 0 097 to 0 98 of the thg in natural soil in china is mehg this is perhaps because the microbial organomercurial lyase breaks the hg c bond and prevents a high percentage of mehg from accumulating in these soils feng and qiu 2008 summers 1986 hence we adopted a conservative estimate of 0 31 0 29 to avoid overestimation of the contribution of soil erosion to avoid double counting in equation 2 amounts of mehg discharge from soil erosion and municipal wastewater in major basins of tributaries are excluded in the mehg budget of the yangtze river fluxes of mehg discharged from soil erosion and municipal wastewater are those discharged from basins of the main stream including direct discharge into the main stream and other small tributaries we did not consider the contribution of direct wet and dry deposition of mehg from atmosphere to the water column the total inland water area including rivers and lakes in china is small approximately 0 2 of the land territory of china mwr 2016 and the contribution of atmospheric mehg deposition is negligible mason et al 2012 in equation 1 s i n k j k could be further described as followed 4 s i n k j k d k a k where d k is the mehg discharge from d k to d k 1 and is calculated as in equation 3 for d 5 mehg is discharged into the coastal ocean a k is the net mehg accumulation in the riverbed of section k and can be derived from equations 1 2 and 4 it should be noted that the amount of net mehg accumulation is subjected to large uncertainty in this study this is because the mass of mehg in the system could vary due to production and degradation in the water column caused by methylation and demethylation of hg which is a complicated confluence of changes of dissolved organic matter photoreactions nutrients and other environmental parameters klapstein and o driscoll 2018 schartup et al 2015 there is no rate constant regarding methylation and demethylation of hg across the yangtze river hence we define δ in equation 1 as an unknown term we also discussed the production δ 0 and degradation δ 0 of mehg and qualitatively compared them with the net mehg accumulation effect later 2 5 data availability and statistical analysis the riverine freshwater discharge suspended sediment discharge and suspended sediment concentration tss data across the yangtze river basin were acquired from the hydrologic data yearbook tables s3 and si mwr 2016 data for the real time highest water level m of the three gorges reservoir were obtained from the yangtze river hydrographic network website www cjh com cn detailed datasets on lateral thg transport induced by soil erosion and mehg discharge from municipal wastewater into the aquatic environment were taken from our published studies figs s2 and si liu et al 2017 2018b we constructed the relationships between concentrations of mehg with other environmental variables based on the best fitting suggested by r version 3 3 3 r project for statistical analysis the results were considered significant at p 0 01 and 0 05 3 results 3 1 mehg discharge from the yangtze river into the coastal ocean we estimate that 470 200 kg of mehg including 210 kg yr of dmehg and 260 kg yr of pmehg was discharged from the yangtze river into the coastal ocean of east asia in 2016 fig 2 a this amount is larger than that of most other large rivers in the world for example mehg discharge from the yangtze river was higher than that from the yukon the length of the main stream is 3200 km and 0 13 million people live in the river basin north america the mackenzie the river length is 1700 km and the basin has a population of 0 40 million north america the mekong the river length is 4400 km and hosts a population of 60 million southeast asia and the mississippi rivers 3700 km long with a population of 11 million north america by factors of 10 25 25 and 28 respectively fig 2b buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 noh et al 2013 schuster et al 2011 this situation occurs because large amounts of freshwater and suspended sediment are transported in the yangtze river and a substantial amount of inorganic hg is exported from the land surface and human activities to the river liu et al 2017 2018b which could be subsequently methylated in situ as discussed later the average mehg concentration at the river mouth of the yangtze river 0 33 ng l weighted by freshwater and suspended sediment discharges is higher than in these rivers whereas the percentage of mehg in the water column approximately 1 0 is similar to those flowing into the arctic ocean but lower than those flowing into the gulf of mexico fig 2b there is a lack of mehg measurements in the water column of the east china sea based on the observation from the western pacific ocean kim et al 2017 mason et al 2012 we estimate that amounts of mehg in the photic 0 100 m and aphotic 100 m layers of the east china sea 7 7 105 km2 are 87 140 kg and 7100 9000 kg respectively this suggests that the yangtze river could act as a significant mehg source for the coastal ocean especially for the photic layer when considering the 61 of riverine suspended sediment removed in the continental shelf of east china sea oguri et al 2003 310 160 kg yr of mehg from the yangtze river could reach the open ocean in 2016 accounting for 1 6 of the global riverine contribution of mehg mason et al 2012 3 2 source apportionment of mehg in the yangtze river the results from material flow analysis suggest that mehg imports from soil erosion could be a substantial source in the upstream although not a primary source for the entire yangtze river as in the case of thg fig 2a liu et al 2018b in total soil erosion induced 320 310 kg yr of mehg discharge into streams in the yangtze river basin including the main stream and tributaries in the early 2010s and the ratio of the flux to riverine mehg discharge into the coastal ocean was 0 68 for the case of thg this ratio was 2 0 2 6 in the early 2010s liu et al 2016a 2018b soil erosion contributed 38 of mehg in the upstream area section 1 fig 2a primarily caused by severe rocky desertification induced by excessive agricultural cultivation in karst landscapes in the western portion of the river basin liu et al 2018b for the three gorges reservoir sections 2 and 3 and the downstream area of the river after the tgd sections 4 and 5 the contribution of soil erosion was negligible 6 8 and 2 5 in the early 2010s respectively since the downstream area is not a hotspot of soil erosion in the study area figs s2 and si as previously noted liu et al 2018b 2019b the model shows that the contributions of major tributaries and municipal wastewater to mehg in the yangtze river basin are lower than that of soil erosion 170 and 22 kg yr in the early 2010s respectively and the ratios of the fluxes to the riverine discharge into the coastal ocean were 0 36 and 0 047 respectively these amounts occur because the mehg concentrations in major tributaries 0 069 0 64 ng l and the effluent from municipal wastewater water treatment plants 0 10 1 4 ng l of the yangtze river basin are not significantly higher than that in the water column of the river 0 065 1 2 ng l liu et al 2017 most of the tributaries in the yangtze river basin do not contribute significant suspended sediments into the main stream of the yangtze river and most of the suspended sediments are derived from the jinsha river originating in eastern tibet and from downstream riverbed erosion yang et al 2014 similar results have been found in the new york estuary and long island sound which showed that municipal wastewater was not a major source of mehg in the water column balcom et al 2004 2008 the above results support the hypothesis that mehg in the riverine water column of the yangtze river is mainly methylated from inorganic hg in the river namely in situ sedimentary production and mobilization balcom et al 2008 mason et al 1999 that was previously discharged into the river liu et al 2016b 2017 2018b 3 3 seasonal changes of mehg transport across the yangtze river and the impact of the tgd we found that the construction of the tgd substantially reduced the riverine mehg flux net decrease 250 kg in 2016 from the upstream regions before the location of the tgd sections 2 and 3 fig 2a especially in summer and autumn fig 3 including the net accumulation of mehg to the riverbed and the net production of mehg from the water level fluctuation zone in the three gorges reservoir the jinsha river a portion of the upstream region of the yangtze river contributed most of the mehg imports to the three gorges reservoir in different seasons 320 kg in 2016 fig 3 the contributions of the major tributaries to the mehg in the reservoir were negligible 9 5 regardless of wet or dry seasons figs 2 and 3 most of the pmehg from the upstream region accumulated in the reservoir due to low water flows induced by the tgd in different seasons in 2016 the percentages of pmehg to the total mehg in the front of the tgd were 0 7 50 which are substantially reduced from 68 to 95 in the jinsha river figs s3 and si only dmehg and a small portion of pmehg could be discharged from the reservoir to the downstream region fig 2a while the runoff flows through the three gorges reservoir the mass of dmehg slightly increased from 92 to 120 kg yr and the mass of pmehg decreased substantially 160 27 kg fig 2a the negative relationship r 0 50 p 0 01 fig 5 between the tss concentration and the log transformed water particulate partition coefficient log10kd calculated by log10 pmehg dmehg of mehg suggests that with the gradual decrease in tss concentration flowing through the reservoir the dmehg concentration might decrease in the reservoir figures s3 and s4 si these results suggest that other sources might also contribute to the dmehg increase in the reservoir bravo et al 2018 in winter both the mehg concentration and percentage of mehg in the reservoir showed slight increases fig 4 b and c however thg concentrations in the water column of the reservoir were also higher than those in the upstream fig 4a suggesting that hg methylation from the water column might be one mechanism schartup et al 2015 in front of the tgd the trend of mehg concentration correlated with the maximum water level at that site fig 6 the abovementioned results could support the hypothesis of the enhancement in mehg production from the water level fluctuation zone of an artificial reservoir associated with anaerobic bacteria and archaea in a limited way compeau and bartha 1985 xiang et al 2018 although the effect of the water level fluctuation zone on mehg production is substantially smaller than the accumulation effect of the reservoir fig 2a this observation might be associated with the low doc level in the reservoir 2 9 6 4 mg l in different seasons fig 5 li et al 2015b we suggested that the tgd induced at least 250 kg of mehg accumulation in the three gorges reservoir in 2016 equal to 70 of the amount of mehg discharge into the coastal ocean however the mehg concentrations at the back of the tgd were 2 8 to 3 fold higher than that at the front of the dam in spring and autumn respectively fig 4b which was previously explained by the reservoir stratification effect in which the reservoir was stratified during the dry season and anoxic hypolimnion water with high mehg concentration was exported downstream kasper et al 2014 nevertheless the thg concentrations at the back of tgd were not significantly higher than at the front fig 4a whereas doc concentrations at the back were higher than that at the front in spring and autumn 6 3 and 1 3 fold higher respectively but not in summer and winter we found that mehg discharge from the reservoir to the downstream region of the yangtze river is not a primary source of mehg in the downstream region 150 kg in 2016 accounting for 32 of that discharge into the coastal ocean fig 2a compared with the riverine mehg flux 430 kg in 2016 in the middle of the downstream region 710 km after the location of tgd fig 3 across all four seasons as we will discuss later the mehg concentrations in the water column in the yangtze river mouth were low except in autumn whereas the thg concentrations were the highest across the river during all the sampling activities fig 4 due to anthropogenic point source releases liu et al 2016b approximately 53 kg of mehg was removed in section 5 in 2016 fig 2a meaning that a substantial amount of mehg was deposited or demethylated in this section due to the substantial increase in the tss concentration 0 15 g l in the river mouth which was 8 fold higher than that at the back of the tgd in 2016 as a consequence of downstream erosion induced by the operation of the tgd yang et al 2014 38 70 of mehg was particulate bound figs s3 and si and most of this amount could be removed in the coastal ocean fig 2a 4 discussion in this study we supply the first systems oriented view of mehg transport across a large river to understand how a large dam and natural and anthropogenic mehg sources modify this transport several recent studies suggested that mehg formed in the sediments is not a primary source of mehg in the estuarine water column and non sedimentary mehg sources such as riverine inputs tidal advection and water column methylation might control mehg levels in the estuarine water column schartup et al 2015 seelen et al 2018 sunderland et al 2010 here we showed that a large river that drains an area with high population density could act as a significant mehg source to the coastal ocean such as in the case of the yangtze river although mehg production and transport in the freshwater ecosystem represents only a minor share of the global aquatic mehg budget the contributions of mehg to global inland and coastal fisheries as predominant hunting and fishing territories could be of great importance and substantially influence human mehg exposure as previously reported liu et al 2018a however riverine mehg and thg fluxes to the coastal ocean have received relatively little measurement attention to date compared with hg deposition in the open ocean particularly in geographic regions outside the arctic region and north america amos et al 2014 buck et al 2015 sonke et al 2018 observations from major rivers in africa south america and south asia and especially from other regional hotspots such as the amazon nile ganges and yellow rivers could help to fill the global data gap in future we agree with the previous suggestion by kocman et al that expanding the current global observing systems global mercury observation system to include riverine hg discharges in addition to the current focus on atmospheric sources is desired kocman et al 2017 many studies have confirmed that in the hg methylation environment reservoirs in a small basin could elevate mehg levels and flow to the downstream area hall et al 2005 hsu kim et al 2018 st louis et al 2004 unfortunately our measuring and modeling results across the yangtze river could not capture this effect in addition elevated fish hg concentrations in the three gorges reservoir did not follow impoundment of the reservoir li et al 2015b a potential explanation for this observation is that the dramatic impact of the reservoir on mehg production in the reservoir only occurred in a shorter term following the construction of the reservoir due to the shorter term enhancement of decomposition of flooded terrestrial organic material hsu kim et al 2018 st louis et al 2004 therefore the mehg production in the three gorges reservoir might have already returned to a level close to its natural state 13 years after the construction of the tgd another possible explanation is the low organic matter content in the catchment and hence the construction of the tgd could not substantially increase the mehg level in the reservoir a previous study found that the concentration of dissolved organic matter in the reservoir was low compared with that in the downstream area of the yangtze river zhang et al 2014 hence the present analysis could not capture earlier effects of mehg production in the three gorges reservoir overall our results suggest that in the present day mehg from the upstream area could be substantially accumulated in the reservoir due to the construction of the tgd suggesting that the three gorges reservoir serves as a net sink for mehg this phenomenon is similar to the case of organic carbon which indicated that the three gorges reservoir is a significant carbon sink li et al 2015a we argue that the river downstream from a large dam could be more contaminated by mehg than the reservoir itself considering the dramatic increase in the riverine mehg flux downstream compared with that discharged from the tgd the riverine mehg flux in the middle of the downstream area approximately 700 km after the tgd of the yangtze river could have a 2 fold increase increased from 150 kg yr to 430 kg yr the increase cannot be explained by only imports from other mehg sources including tributaries soil erosion and municipal wastewater as demonstrated previously one explanation is that the increase in organic matter content enhances the net mehg production in the downstream region hsu kim et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 this explanation might be not reliable for all seasons in the study area because the percentage of mehg decreased from the back of the tgd to the middle of the downstream region in spring and autumn and decreased when reaching the river mouth in spring summer and winter fig 4c this trend was essentially consistent with the trend of doc concentration fig 5 suggesting a potential net degradation of mehg in the river downstream in these seasons this might be a consequence of seasonal changes linked to the organic matter release in the river downstream kasper et al 2014 roulet et al 2000 nevertheless the concentration of pmehg in the river mouth water column was higher than that in the reservoir by a factor of 3 while the concentration of dmehg was decreased 31 these results suggest that there is potentially another mechanism that influences the pmehg concentrations another explanation for the observations is the downstream impact induced by the tgd ordinary large rivers transport particles eroded from the upstream areas and deposit most of them in the downstream areas of the rivers such as in the case of the yangtze river before the construction of tgd yang et al 2014 however due to the construction of the tgd 63 tg yr of sediment was eroded from the channel downstream of the tgd in the post tgd decade after 2003 which was significantly shifted from 78 tg yr of deposition in the pre tgd period 1956 2002 yang et al 2014 meanwhile the concentration and flux of tss substantially increased from the tgd to the river mouth by factors of 8 and 18 respectively which were mainly induced by the downstream impact of the tgd 140 tg yr and slightly contributed to by major tributaries 27 tg yr and soil erosion 7 0 tg yr in the downstream area brandt 2000 yang et al 2014 many particle bounded contaminants previously buried in the downstream area could be depleted into the water column again due to the operation of the tgd our results for the percentages of mehg bound to particles include the substantial increase from the back of tgd 18 range 0 60 48 in different seasons to the river mouth 56 range 38 70 in different seasons support the second hypothesis figs s3 and si therefore the operation of the tgd could have significant impacts on the mehg flux in the river downstream and the impact was potentially weakened by the decrease in dissolved organic matter concentration and flow rate from the back of the tgd to the river mouth by synthesizing a large amount of measurements we also previously found that the average mehg concentration in fish tissue in the downstream area was higher than that in the three gorges reservoir and other upstream areas of the river liu et al 2018a however our current efforts could not quantitatively examine the tgd induced downstream impact on the mehg bioaccumulation in the food web because the downstream area of the yangtze river received a large amount of anthropogenic inorganic hg which has the potential to be directly methylated in the water column and sediment liu et al 2016b 2017 if the second hypothesis contributes more mehg in the water column the tgd might significantly influence the fate of mehg and its subsequent bioaccumulation in the downstream areas and the coastal ocean for at least several decades brandt 2000 yang et al 2014 further efforts in measurements of hg methylation and demethylation ratios in water and soil sediment in the river as well as refinement of mehg discharges from soil erosion and point source release are highly desirable it should be noted that methods applied in the present study and associated results are subject to certain uncertainties the overall uncertainty of the results in this study is not low figs s5 and si for example the uncertainty of the amount of mehg discharge from the yangtze river to the coastal ocean reaches 43 relative standard deviation fig 2a especially in the flooding season 56 fig s5 in si these results are driven by the variability in measured mehg concentrations in riverine water tables s4 and si there is no rate constant for methylation and demethylation of hg in the yangtze river this makes it difficult to distinguish net accumulation of mehg and methylation and demethylation of hg in the yangtze river changes in percentages of mehg occur in the downstream in different seasons fig 4c and this might be associated with the organic matter release in the river downstream however it is difficult to quantitatively separate the influences of organic matter release and operation of the tgd on the percentage of mehg in the downstream this might also increase the uncertainty of the results it should be noted that the mehg transport mechanism in a large river continuum is too complicated to be identified based on one year of observation nevertheless we believe that the fluxes of mehg calculated in the present study are reliable and would not have large uncertainties since fluxes of freshwater and suspended sediment in the yangtze river basin have no significant change in the past ten years mwr 2016 and we have considered seasonal changes in the study area during the sampling period more time series observational data and studies on the potential influences of other parameters such as nutrients on the mehg production are needed in the study area for future studies 5 conclusions overall our analysis quantifies mehg transport across a large river and examines the impacts of major anthropogenic and natural perturbations on that transport we identified three conclusions based on our analysis 1 a large amount of mehg could be discharged from the yangtze river to the coastal ocean and subsequently to the open ocean 2 the tgd induced a net accumulation of riverine mehg in the three gorges reservoir and 3 the river downstream from the tgd is more contaminated by mehg than the reservoir itself which might be due to the tgd induced downstream erosional impact rather than discharges from the reservoir

18464,the magnitude of environmental change due to anthropogenic impacts might greatly exceed that of natural disturbances in this work we quantitatively examine the impacts of river damming soil erosion and point source release on the transport of methylmercury mehg throughout the yangtze river the third longest river in the world based on seasonal observations and the subsequent material flow analysis we found that in 2016 the yangtze river discharged 470 200 kg mehg to the coastal and shelf areas a value at least ten fold larger than existing observations in other large rivers around the world the construction of the three gorges dam tgd the world s largest hydropower dam induced a substantial amount of mehg at least 250 220 kg accumulation in the reservoir and a relatively small amount of mehg 150 37 kg discharge to the downstream region in 2016 the reservoir itself is not expected to be more contaminated by mehg than the downstream areas of the river after the tgd and the tgd has an additive effect on downstream mehg transport the riverine mehg flux in the river mouth was 3 fold that discharged from the tgd mainly due to tgd induced resuspension of mehg from the downstream riverbed as well as mehg imports to the downstream area from tributaries soil erosion municipal wastewater and in situ production our analysis offers new evidence that in future decades the increase in estuarine mehg contamination resulting from the increasing construction of large dams might pose a challenge for global coastal fisheries graphical abstract image 1 keywords methylmercury river continuum coastal ocean river damming soil erosion point source release 1 introduction methylmercury mehg is a potent neurotoxin that is biomagnified in marine and freshwater food webs and poses health risks for humans and wildlife lavoie et al 2013 mason et al 2012 rivers connect mercury hg in the terrestrial ecosystem and from atmospheric deposition with its subsequent export to the coastal ocean and to the food webs and has been considered as a major hg source in the coastal ocean mason et al 2012 the quantification of the flux of riverine hg discharge to the coastal ocean has been conducted widely buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 sonke et al 2018 as described in the following text a major knowledge gap exists with respect to how mehg is transported throughout the riverine ecosystem to the coastal ocean and how it is modulated by natural and anthropogenic perturbations namely river damming soil erosion water induced and municipal wastewater hg cycling in the aquatic environment is influenced by landscape perturbations such as the creation of reservoirs due to river damming which has raised scientific concerns hsu kim et al 2018 flooding associated with reservoirs causes a long term increase in mehg production in many river basins and is considered to be a result of decomposing terrestrial organic matter which leads to the increasing activities of methylating bacteria and an increased net mehg production in flooded soils bravo et al 2018 hall et al 2005 podar et al 2015 schartup et al 2015 st louis et al 2004 for example research in the experimental lakes of canada showed that flooding increased mehg concentrations in the water column by a factor of 40 st louis et al 2004 research in recent decades has verified that reservoirs can elevate hg concentrations in fish brigham et al 2002 kamman et al 2005 meister et al 1979 possible alterations to the downstream mehg fluxes due to mehg releases from reservoirs have been evaluated in some river basins for example kasper et al 2014 investigated the effects of reservoir stratification on downstream export of mehg formed in reservoirs of the balbina hydroelectric dam in the uatumã river kasper et al 2014 calder et al 2016 evaluated the mehg transport in a small river basin in canada and forecasted a 10 fold increase in riverine mehg levels and 2 6 fold increase in estuarine surface waters due to mehg origination from the reservoir calder et al 2016 nevertheless these efforts were carried out in small river basins and are still under question in downstream of large rivers most previous studies focused on impacts of mehg from reservoirs on downstream areas and damming induced downstream hydrological impacts that influence downstream mehg loading are not well understood terrestrial ecosystems including agricultural and forested ecosystems and urban areas can effectively sequester hg from the atmosphere by accumulation in vegetation and soils obrist et al 2011 in most cases soil erosion occur as a result of agricultural cultivation industrial development elevation increase and vegetation removal langbein and schumm 1958 liu et al 2018b reiners et al 2003 roulet et al 1999 for example the extensive human induced deforestation taking place in developing countries has caused a substantial release of total hg thg all forms of hg from the land surface into the aquatic environment in the past several decades liu et al 2018b roulet et al 1999 in streams flowing through harvested and agricultural catchments increases in mehg loads in the water have been observed and were attributed to the increased soil erosion in the catchments eklof et al 2014 kronberg et al 2016 porvari et al 2003 previous studies found that the anthropogenic point source release was a significant source of thg to the freshwater environment in both global 1000 mg yr and regional scales for example 110 mg yr in china especially in developing regions kocman et al 2017 liu et al 2017 although it is unclear for the case of mehg in addition mehg could be produced from the methylation of inorganic hg that was previously discharged into the river in situ sedimentary production and mobilization or be degraded processes which are controlled by physicochemical characteristics such as ph value nutrients dissolved organic matter and other environmental parameters barkay and wagner döbler 2005 hsu kim et al 2018 klapstein and o driscoll 2018 schartup et al 2015 nevertheless the relative importance of in situ mehg production compared with external sources contributions of soil erosion and municipal wastewater to riverine mehg is still unclear in many large rivers to quantitatively understand the impacts of river damming and external mehg sources soil erosion and municipal wastewater on mehg transport in a large river we first collected samples of freshwater and suspended sediment across the yangtze river basin fig 1 and fig s1 in the supporting information si covering approximately 3300 km of the river in different seasons in 2016 this is the first measurement of mehg across the yangtze river second we applied material flow analysis to quantitatively describe how the mehg transport is modulated by river damming large scale soil erosion and municipal wastewater and to assess the importance of in situ production compared with external inputs of mehg this study is motivated by our recognition of the potential confluence of river damming together with other sources on the transport of mehg in a large river which shares motivation with global environmental protection and enhancement of food security 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river originates in the tibetan plateau and flows through the densely populated eastern region of china the river is the third longest river 6400 km in the world and discharges large amounts of freshwater and suspended sediment 1000 km3 yr and 150 tg yr in 2016 respectively into the western margin of north pacific ocean mwr 2016 the river basin is inhabited by approximately 500 million people and is one of the most developed industrial regions in the world human activities such as agriculture animal husbandry and mining have resulted in elevated hg contamination and serious soil erosion in the river basin in the past several decades figs s2 and si liu et al 2018b the three gorges dam tgd the largest dam 185 m high and 2335 m long that generates the largest amount of hydroelectricity in the world is situated halfway along the yangtze river fig 1 stone 2008 2 2 sample collection filtered water and suspended particles were collected in 2016 from 12 sites close to hydrographic gauging stations across the yangtze river basin to quantify the mehg fluxes across the river we collected the samples using techniques employed in previous studies buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 schuster et al 2011 as highlighted by other researchers seasonal sampling was lacking for hg fluxes in large rivers amos et al 2014 emmerton et al 2013 therefore for sample sites in the main stream of the river fig 1 we collected samples during all four seasons spring february to april summer may to july autumn august to october and winter november to january for six major tributaries and lakes of the river basin including the han wu jialing and min rivers and the poyang and dongting lakes which have both the highest freshwater and suspended sediment discharges into the yangtze river in the river basin we collected samples during the wet may to october and dry remaining of the year seasons the detailed sampling information are provided in table s1 and figs s1 and si prior to sampling all bottles in the laboratory were cleaned by immersion in a 10 hno3 vol vol bath for at least 24 h followed by repeated rinses in milli q grade water 18 2 mω cm other cleaning steps followed the u s environmental protection agency method epa 1998 it is difficult to sample water from different depths of a large river following published literature in other large rivers buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 the sampling was conducted from a boat at each site and riverine water was collected by a peristaltic pump from approximately 1 m below the water s surface into precleaned amber glass bottles buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 liu et al 2017 schartup et al 2015 we avoided precipitation days for sampling liu et al 2017 sample sites were selected in the middle of the main stream and tributaries that have no known nearby point source influences such as wastewater discharge chen et al 2019a water was also sampled in the yangtze river mouth on three to four consecutive days of each season to identify any potential time differences in the river mouth the tidal influence on the sampling site in the river mouth is limited dai and liu 2013 saito et al 2001 it is a challenge for us to sample water from the bottom of the three gorges reservoir hence for the location of the tgd we set two sampling sites at 0 5 km before and 3 km after the tgd to identify the potential change in mehg levels before and after the tgd we collected triplicate or quadruplicate water samples 1000 ml of each bottle from each site depending on the particle concentration in the water column of each site to avoid sample contamination we used a method commonly known as clean hands dirty hands emmerton et al 2013 we filtered all water samples through a cellulose nitrate membrane with 0 45 μm pore size whatman product code 10401170 for 300 to 1000 ml of riverine bulk water we preserved the filtered water samples by adding 4 ml l of 11 6 m trace metal grade hydrochloric acid hcl equal to 0 4 of the sample volume and stored the filtered water and particle samples under cool and dark conditions the samples were delivered by high speed rail transport or by air to our lab in beijing within 24 h filtered water and particles samples were stored at 4 c or were preserved by freezing respectively until analysis 2 3 analytical methodology filtered water and suspended particles analysis analyzed for mehg following the methods of previous studies buck et al 2015 munson et al 2014 in brief dissolved mehg dmehg was determined from an acidified sample 1 h2so4 12 h and particulate mehg pmehg was leached with 4 5 m hno3 in a water bath at 60 1 c for 12 h all filtered water samples and extract liquors were neutralized with koh buffered with acetate subjected to improved extraction with ascorbic acid derivatized into methylethylmercury with sodium tetraethyl borate and quantified using gas chromatographic cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry gc afs tekran 2700 all particle samples were extracted in duplicate mehg was analyzed at the ministry of education laboratory of earth surface process in peking university the method detection limit dl was 4 pg l for mehg which was calculated based on the average concentrations of the method blanks plus triple the standard deviation of the blanks spike recoveries 0 5 ng l for ambient mehg samples were 88 10 field blanks in different seasons ranged from dl to 0 02 ng l and most of the field blanks are not significantly higher than the limit mehg was detectable in all samples and the concentrations were adjusted using individual internal standard spike recoveries the thg concentrations of the samples are referenced from our other study liu et al 2019a which applied cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry cvafs tekran 2600 at the institute of tibetan plateau research emmerton et al 2013 the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc in the filter water samples were determined using a toc 5000a instrument shimadzu corp japan in peking university water quality parameters such as temperature t dissolved oxygen do and ph value were measured by a portable analyzer radiometer analytical in the fields 2 4 material flow analysis for mehg transport across the yangtze river material flow analysis has historically been used as an effective tool to offer a system oriented view of the interlinked processes of contaminants such as carbon nutrients organic pollutants and trace metals including thg bai et al 2016 brunner and rechberger 2016 chen et al 2019b churkina 2008 lin et al 2016 in this study we applied this technique to understand how mehg transport is modulated by river damming as well as large scale soil erosion and municipal wastewater this study is the first time that this technique was applied to mehg transport in a large river based on a source to sink process of freshwater and suspended sediment in the river system the calculation of material flow for mehg transport in the yangtze river began with the imports of mehg from tributaries municipal wastewater and soil erosion and continued with mehg transport in each section of the main stream with a final step of mehg release into the coastal ocean or accumulation in the riverbed the analysis was established based on the mass balance principle given below 1 i k s o u r c e i k δ k j k s i n k j k where i and j are different sources and sinks of mehg respectively k is the section from 1 to 5 of the main stream of the yangtze river basin as a temporary pool of mehg s o u r c e i k is the source i of mehg kg yr in the water column of section k s i n k j k represents the sink j of mehg kg yr in section k and δ k is defined as the uncertainty of the mass balance system kg yr of section k in this work we divide the main stream of the river into five sections boxes upstream jinsha river k 1 the front portion of the reservoir from yibin city to chongqing city k 2 the back portion of the reservoir from chongqing city to the tgd k 3 the front portion of the downstream area from the tgd to wuhan city k 4 and the back portion of the downstream area from wuhan city to the river mouth k 5 s o u r c e i k can be calculated as written below 2 i k s o u r c e i k k t k k m k k s k where t k m k and s k are imports of mehg from tributaries municipal wastewater and soil erosion kg yr respectively to the main stream of the yangtze river the contributions of the tributaries are calculated as shown below 3 t a c d a f d a c p a s s d a where c d a and c p a represent the concentrations of dmehg ng l and pmehg ng g in tributary a t a respectively and f d a and s s d a represent the amounts of freshwater discharge km3 yr and suspended sediment discharge tg yr from tributary a into the main stream in equation 2 the distribution of municipal wastewater release of mehg to the main stream was taken from our published paper figs s2 and si following previous studies in the new york estuary and long island sound we consider the discharge of mehg from municipal wastewater in the current study balcom et al 2004 2008 a lack of mehg measurement in natural soil exists across the yangtze river basin because mehg contamination in the soil ecosystem in china has received relatively little attention to date particularly in geographic regions outside of the hg mining areas of guizhou province revis et al 1990 and mailman and bodaly 2005 suggested that approximately 1 of the thg in natural soil is mehg mailman and bodaly 2005 revis et al 1990 whereas horvat et al 2003 found that the percentage of mehg in soils rarely exceeds 1 in china horvat et al 2003 the thg concentrations in soils across china are relatively high compared with other regions liu et al 2018b based on the published literature in china tables s2 and si we calculated that 0 31 0 29 mean standard deviation ranged from 0 097 to 0 98 of the thg in natural soil in china is mehg this is perhaps because the microbial organomercurial lyase breaks the hg c bond and prevents a high percentage of mehg from accumulating in these soils feng and qiu 2008 summers 1986 hence we adopted a conservative estimate of 0 31 0 29 to avoid overestimation of the contribution of soil erosion to avoid double counting in equation 2 amounts of mehg discharge from soil erosion and municipal wastewater in major basins of tributaries are excluded in the mehg budget of the yangtze river fluxes of mehg discharged from soil erosion and municipal wastewater are those discharged from basins of the main stream including direct discharge into the main stream and other small tributaries we did not consider the contribution of direct wet and dry deposition of mehg from atmosphere to the water column the total inland water area including rivers and lakes in china is small approximately 0 2 of the land territory of china mwr 2016 and the contribution of atmospheric mehg deposition is negligible mason et al 2012 in equation 1 s i n k j k could be further described as followed 4 s i n k j k d k a k where d k is the mehg discharge from d k to d k 1 and is calculated as in equation 3 for d 5 mehg is discharged into the coastal ocean a k is the net mehg accumulation in the riverbed of section k and can be derived from equations 1 2 and 4 it should be noted that the amount of net mehg accumulation is subjected to large uncertainty in this study this is because the mass of mehg in the system could vary due to production and degradation in the water column caused by methylation and demethylation of hg which is a complicated confluence of changes of dissolved organic matter photoreactions nutrients and other environmental parameters klapstein and o driscoll 2018 schartup et al 2015 there is no rate constant regarding methylation and demethylation of hg across the yangtze river hence we define δ in equation 1 as an unknown term we also discussed the production δ 0 and degradation δ 0 of mehg and qualitatively compared them with the net mehg accumulation effect later 2 5 data availability and statistical analysis the riverine freshwater discharge suspended sediment discharge and suspended sediment concentration tss data across the yangtze river basin were acquired from the hydrologic data yearbook tables s3 and si mwr 2016 data for the real time highest water level m of the three gorges reservoir were obtained from the yangtze river hydrographic network website www cjh com cn detailed datasets on lateral thg transport induced by soil erosion and mehg discharge from municipal wastewater into the aquatic environment were taken from our published studies figs s2 and si liu et al 2017 2018b we constructed the relationships between concentrations of mehg with other environmental variables based on the best fitting suggested by r version 3 3 3 r project for statistical analysis the results were considered significant at p 0 01 and 0 05 3 results 3 1 mehg discharge from the yangtze river into the coastal ocean we estimate that 470 200 kg of mehg including 210 kg yr of dmehg and 260 kg yr of pmehg was discharged from the yangtze river into the coastal ocean of east asia in 2016 fig 2 a this amount is larger than that of most other large rivers in the world for example mehg discharge from the yangtze river was higher than that from the yukon the length of the main stream is 3200 km and 0 13 million people live in the river basin north america the mackenzie the river length is 1700 km and the basin has a population of 0 40 million north america the mekong the river length is 4400 km and hosts a population of 60 million southeast asia and the mississippi rivers 3700 km long with a population of 11 million north america by factors of 10 25 25 and 28 respectively fig 2b buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 noh et al 2013 schuster et al 2011 this situation occurs because large amounts of freshwater and suspended sediment are transported in the yangtze river and a substantial amount of inorganic hg is exported from the land surface and human activities to the river liu et al 2017 2018b which could be subsequently methylated in situ as discussed later the average mehg concentration at the river mouth of the yangtze river 0 33 ng l weighted by freshwater and suspended sediment discharges is higher than in these rivers whereas the percentage of mehg in the water column approximately 1 0 is similar to those flowing into the arctic ocean but lower than those flowing into the gulf of mexico fig 2b there is a lack of mehg measurements in the water column of the east china sea based on the observation from the western pacific ocean kim et al 2017 mason et al 2012 we estimate that amounts of mehg in the photic 0 100 m and aphotic 100 m layers of the east china sea 7 7 105 km2 are 87 140 kg and 7100 9000 kg respectively this suggests that the yangtze river could act as a significant mehg source for the coastal ocean especially for the photic layer when considering the 61 of riverine suspended sediment removed in the continental shelf of east china sea oguri et al 2003 310 160 kg yr of mehg from the yangtze river could reach the open ocean in 2016 accounting for 1 6 of the global riverine contribution of mehg mason et al 2012 3 2 source apportionment of mehg in the yangtze river the results from material flow analysis suggest that mehg imports from soil erosion could be a substantial source in the upstream although not a primary source for the entire yangtze river as in the case of thg fig 2a liu et al 2018b in total soil erosion induced 320 310 kg yr of mehg discharge into streams in the yangtze river basin including the main stream and tributaries in the early 2010s and the ratio of the flux to riverine mehg discharge into the coastal ocean was 0 68 for the case of thg this ratio was 2 0 2 6 in the early 2010s liu et al 2016a 2018b soil erosion contributed 38 of mehg in the upstream area section 1 fig 2a primarily caused by severe rocky desertification induced by excessive agricultural cultivation in karst landscapes in the western portion of the river basin liu et al 2018b for the three gorges reservoir sections 2 and 3 and the downstream area of the river after the tgd sections 4 and 5 the contribution of soil erosion was negligible 6 8 and 2 5 in the early 2010s respectively since the downstream area is not a hotspot of soil erosion in the study area figs s2 and si as previously noted liu et al 2018b 2019b the model shows that the contributions of major tributaries and municipal wastewater to mehg in the yangtze river basin are lower than that of soil erosion 170 and 22 kg yr in the early 2010s respectively and the ratios of the fluxes to the riverine discharge into the coastal ocean were 0 36 and 0 047 respectively these amounts occur because the mehg concentrations in major tributaries 0 069 0 64 ng l and the effluent from municipal wastewater water treatment plants 0 10 1 4 ng l of the yangtze river basin are not significantly higher than that in the water column of the river 0 065 1 2 ng l liu et al 2017 most of the tributaries in the yangtze river basin do not contribute significant suspended sediments into the main stream of the yangtze river and most of the suspended sediments are derived from the jinsha river originating in eastern tibet and from downstream riverbed erosion yang et al 2014 similar results have been found in the new york estuary and long island sound which showed that municipal wastewater was not a major source of mehg in the water column balcom et al 2004 2008 the above results support the hypothesis that mehg in the riverine water column of the yangtze river is mainly methylated from inorganic hg in the river namely in situ sedimentary production and mobilization balcom et al 2008 mason et al 1999 that was previously discharged into the river liu et al 2016b 2017 2018b 3 3 seasonal changes of mehg transport across the yangtze river and the impact of the tgd we found that the construction of the tgd substantially reduced the riverine mehg flux net decrease 250 kg in 2016 from the upstream regions before the location of the tgd sections 2 and 3 fig 2a especially in summer and autumn fig 3 including the net accumulation of mehg to the riverbed and the net production of mehg from the water level fluctuation zone in the three gorges reservoir the jinsha river a portion of the upstream region of the yangtze river contributed most of the mehg imports to the three gorges reservoir in different seasons 320 kg in 2016 fig 3 the contributions of the major tributaries to the mehg in the reservoir were negligible 9 5 regardless of wet or dry seasons figs 2 and 3 most of the pmehg from the upstream region accumulated in the reservoir due to low water flows induced by the tgd in different seasons in 2016 the percentages of pmehg to the total mehg in the front of the tgd were 0 7 50 which are substantially reduced from 68 to 95 in the jinsha river figs s3 and si only dmehg and a small portion of pmehg could be discharged from the reservoir to the downstream region fig 2a while the runoff flows through the three gorges reservoir the mass of dmehg slightly increased from 92 to 120 kg yr and the mass of pmehg decreased substantially 160 27 kg fig 2a the negative relationship r 0 50 p 0 01 fig 5 between the tss concentration and the log transformed water particulate partition coefficient log10kd calculated by log10 pmehg dmehg of mehg suggests that with the gradual decrease in tss concentration flowing through the reservoir the dmehg concentration might decrease in the reservoir figures s3 and s4 si these results suggest that other sources might also contribute to the dmehg increase in the reservoir bravo et al 2018 in winter both the mehg concentration and percentage of mehg in the reservoir showed slight increases fig 4 b and c however thg concentrations in the water column of the reservoir were also higher than those in the upstream fig 4a suggesting that hg methylation from the water column might be one mechanism schartup et al 2015 in front of the tgd the trend of mehg concentration correlated with the maximum water level at that site fig 6 the abovementioned results could support the hypothesis of the enhancement in mehg production from the water level fluctuation zone of an artificial reservoir associated with anaerobic bacteria and archaea in a limited way compeau and bartha 1985 xiang et al 2018 although the effect of the water level fluctuation zone on mehg production is substantially smaller than the accumulation effect of the reservoir fig 2a this observation might be associated with the low doc level in the reservoir 2 9 6 4 mg l in different seasons fig 5 li et al 2015b we suggested that the tgd induced at least 250 kg of mehg accumulation in the three gorges reservoir in 2016 equal to 70 of the amount of mehg discharge into the coastal ocean however the mehg concentrations at the back of the tgd were 2 8 to 3 fold higher than that at the front of the dam in spring and autumn respectively fig 4b which was previously explained by the reservoir stratification effect in which the reservoir was stratified during the dry season and anoxic hypolimnion water with high mehg concentration was exported downstream kasper et al 2014 nevertheless the thg concentrations at the back of tgd were not significantly higher than at the front fig 4a whereas doc concentrations at the back were higher than that at the front in spring and autumn 6 3 and 1 3 fold higher respectively but not in summer and winter we found that mehg discharge from the reservoir to the downstream region of the yangtze river is not a primary source of mehg in the downstream region 150 kg in 2016 accounting for 32 of that discharge into the coastal ocean fig 2a compared with the riverine mehg flux 430 kg in 2016 in the middle of the downstream region 710 km after the location of tgd fig 3 across all four seasons as we will discuss later the mehg concentrations in the water column in the yangtze river mouth were low except in autumn whereas the thg concentrations were the highest across the river during all the sampling activities fig 4 due to anthropogenic point source releases liu et al 2016b approximately 53 kg of mehg was removed in section 5 in 2016 fig 2a meaning that a substantial amount of mehg was deposited or demethylated in this section due to the substantial increase in the tss concentration 0 15 g l in the river mouth which was 8 fold higher than that at the back of the tgd in 2016 as a consequence of downstream erosion induced by the operation of the tgd yang et al 2014 38 70 of mehg was particulate bound figs s3 and si and most of this amount could be removed in the coastal ocean fig 2a 4 discussion in this study we supply the first systems oriented view of mehg transport across a large river to understand how a large dam and natural and anthropogenic mehg sources modify this transport several recent studies suggested that mehg formed in the sediments is not a primary source of mehg in the estuarine water column and non sedimentary mehg sources such as riverine inputs tidal advection and water column methylation might control mehg levels in the estuarine water column schartup et al 2015 seelen et al 2018 sunderland et al 2010 here we showed that a large river that drains an area with high population density could act as a significant mehg source to the coastal ocean such as in the case of the yangtze river although mehg production and transport in the freshwater ecosystem represents only a minor share of the global aquatic mehg budget the contributions of mehg to global inland and coastal fisheries as predominant hunting and fishing territories could be of great importance and substantially influence human mehg exposure as previously reported liu et al 2018a however riverine mehg and thg fluxes to the coastal ocean have received relatively little measurement attention to date compared with hg deposition in the open ocean particularly in geographic regions outside the arctic region and north america amos et al 2014 buck et al 2015 sonke et al 2018 observations from major rivers in africa south america and south asia and especially from other regional hotspots such as the amazon nile ganges and yellow rivers could help to fill the global data gap in future we agree with the previous suggestion by kocman et al that expanding the current global observing systems global mercury observation system to include riverine hg discharges in addition to the current focus on atmospheric sources is desired kocman et al 2017 many studies have confirmed that in the hg methylation environment reservoirs in a small basin could elevate mehg levels and flow to the downstream area hall et al 2005 hsu kim et al 2018 st louis et al 2004 unfortunately our measuring and modeling results across the yangtze river could not capture this effect in addition elevated fish hg concentrations in the three gorges reservoir did not follow impoundment of the reservoir li et al 2015b a potential explanation for this observation is that the dramatic impact of the reservoir on mehg production in the reservoir only occurred in a shorter term following the construction of the reservoir due to the shorter term enhancement of decomposition of flooded terrestrial organic material hsu kim et al 2018 st louis et al 2004 therefore the mehg production in the three gorges reservoir might have already returned to a level close to its natural state 13 years after the construction of the tgd another possible explanation is the low organic matter content in the catchment and hence the construction of the tgd could not substantially increase the mehg level in the reservoir a previous study found that the concentration of dissolved organic matter in the reservoir was low compared with that in the downstream area of the yangtze river zhang et al 2014 hence the present analysis could not capture earlier effects of mehg production in the three gorges reservoir overall our results suggest that in the present day mehg from the upstream area could be substantially accumulated in the reservoir due to the construction of the tgd suggesting that the three gorges reservoir serves as a net sink for mehg this phenomenon is similar to the case of organic carbon which indicated that the three gorges reservoir is a significant carbon sink li et al 2015a we argue that the river downstream from a large dam could be more contaminated by mehg than the reservoir itself considering the dramatic increase in the riverine mehg flux downstream compared with that discharged from the tgd the riverine mehg flux in the middle of the downstream area approximately 700 km after the tgd of the yangtze river could have a 2 fold increase increased from 150 kg yr to 430 kg yr the increase cannot be explained by only imports from other mehg sources including tributaries soil erosion and municipal wastewater as demonstrated previously one explanation is that the increase in organic matter content enhances the net mehg production in the downstream region hsu kim et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 this explanation might be not reliable for all seasons in the study area because the percentage of mehg decreased from the back of the tgd to the middle of the downstream region in spring and autumn and decreased when reaching the river mouth in spring summer and winter fig 4c this trend was essentially consistent with the trend of doc concentration fig 5 suggesting a potential net degradation of mehg in the river downstream in these seasons this might be a consequence of seasonal changes linked to the organic matter release in the river downstream kasper et al 2014 roulet et al 2000 nevertheless the concentration of pmehg in the river mouth water column was higher than that in the reservoir by a factor of 3 while the concentration of dmehg was decreased 31 these results suggest that there is potentially another mechanism that influences the pmehg concentrations another explanation for the observations is the downstream impact induced by the tgd ordinary large rivers transport particles eroded from the upstream areas and deposit most of them in the downstream areas of the rivers such as in the case of the yangtze river before the construction of tgd yang et al 2014 however due to the construction of the tgd 63 tg yr of sediment was eroded from the channel downstream of the tgd in the post tgd decade after 2003 which was significantly shifted from 78 tg yr of deposition in the pre tgd period 1956 2002 yang et al 2014 meanwhile the concentration and flux of tss substantially increased from the tgd to the river mouth by factors of 8 and 18 respectively which were mainly induced by the downstream impact of the tgd 140 tg yr and slightly contributed to by major tributaries 27 tg yr and soil erosion 7 0 tg yr in the downstream area brandt 2000 yang et al 2014 many particle bounded contaminants previously buried in the downstream area could be depleted into the water column again due to the operation of the tgd our results for the percentages of mehg bound to particles include the substantial increase from the back of tgd 18 range 0 60 48 in different seasons to the river mouth 56 range 38 70 in different seasons support the second hypothesis figs s3 and si therefore the operation of the tgd could have significant impacts on the mehg flux in the river downstream and the impact was potentially weakened by the decrease in dissolved organic matter concentration and flow rate from the back of the tgd to the river mouth by synthesizing a large amount of measurements we also previously found that the average mehg concentration in fish tissue in the downstream area was higher than that in the three gorges reservoir and other upstream areas of the river liu et al 2018a however our current efforts could not quantitatively examine the tgd induced downstream impact on the mehg bioaccumulation in the food web because the downstream area of the yangtze river received a large amount of anthropogenic inorganic hg which has the potential to be directly methylated in the water column and sediment liu et al 2016b 2017 if the second hypothesis contributes more mehg in the water column the tgd might significantly influence the fate of mehg and its subsequent bioaccumulation in the downstream areas and the coastal ocean for at least several decades brandt 2000 yang et al 2014 further efforts in measurements of hg methylation and demethylation ratios in water and soil sediment in the river as well as refinement of mehg discharges from soil erosion and point source release are highly desirable it should be noted that methods applied in the present study and associated results are subject to certain uncertainties the overall uncertainty of the results in this study is not low figs s5 and si for example the uncertainty of the amount of mehg discharge from the yangtze river to the coastal ocean reaches 43 relative standard deviation fig 2a especially in the flooding season 56 fig s5 in si these results are driven by the variability in measured mehg concentrations in riverine water tables s4 and si there is no rate constant for methylation and demethylation of hg in the yangtze river this makes it difficult to distinguish net accumulation of mehg and methylation and demethylation of hg in the yangtze river changes in percentages of mehg occur in the downstream in different seasons fig 4c and this might be associated with the organic matter release in the river downstream however it is difficult to quantitatively separate the influences of organic matter release and operation of the tgd on the percentage of mehg in the downstream this might also increase the uncertainty of the results it should be noted that the mehg transport mechanism in a large river continuum is too complicated to be identified based on one year of observation nevertheless we believe that the fluxes of mehg calculated in the present study are reliable and would not have large uncertainties since fluxes of freshwater and suspended sediment in the yangtze river basin have no significant change in the past ten years mwr 2016 and we have considered seasonal changes in the study area during the sampling period more time series observational data and studies on the potential influences of other parameters such as nutrients on the mehg production are needed in the study area for future studies 5 conclusions overall our analysis quantifies mehg transport across a large river and examines the impacts of major anthropogenic and natural perturbations on that transport we identified three conclusions based on our analysis 1 a large amount of mehg could be discharged from the yangtze river to the coastal ocean and subsequently to the open ocean 2 the tgd induced a net accumulation of riverine mehg in the three gorges reservoir and 3 the river downstream from the tgd is more contaminated by mehg than the reservoir itself which might be due to the tgd induced downstream erosional impact rather than discharges from the reservoir
